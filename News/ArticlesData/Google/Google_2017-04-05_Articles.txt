Exclusive: Google is building two Android Wear smartwatches with Google Assistant integration David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2016/07/06 11:11am PDTJul 6, 2016 378 Plus 1 on G+ 630 Share on Facebook 9 Share on Twitter Total Shares1017 Android Wear Exclusives Leaks News Rumors Speaking to Android Police, a reliable source has told us that Google is currently building two Android Wear devices - possibly Nexus-branded - for release some time after the latest Nexus phones are announced. One watch will be larger, sportier, and more fully-featured (LTE, GPS, heart rate), the other will be smaller and lack the aforementioned mobile data and GPS. Disclaimer: No matter the confidence level, there's always a chance product updates, features, and some or all details will be changed or cancelled altogether. As with all rumors, nothing is 100% until it's officially announced. We do not have possession of any APKs we can distribute or unreleased devices, so please don't ask for them. Confidence level We give this rumor a confidence level of 9 out of 10. We are extremely confident Google is in the process of prototyping these in-house Wear devices, and have confirmation of their existence from multiple sources. We are subtracting a point from our confidence because of the ongoing development occurring for these devices, and the possibility that they may change or that one or both may be cancelled (or delayed), as well as the fact that we are unable to share our primary source information for this post. There also remains some ambiguity about the codenames I will use for these watches, and whether or not these names are currently being used, so consider them nothing more than easy ways to refer back to either device at this point. The evidence As I said, we are unable to share any direct evidence of the existence of these devices at this time. However, because of the quality of our source, we feel confident in publishing information about these devices, including descriptions of their respective appearances. To ensure we are clear on one thing before we start: the hero image of this post is 100% a fabrication [hopefully obviously, because my talentless ass made it] and has no resemblance to either watch. So, let's get started. Both watches have full circular displays. We do not believe either will have "flat tires." Let's start with the larger watch, which we believe to be codenamed Angelfish. Angelfish bears some resemblance to the current Moto 360 and LG's Urbane 2nd Edition LTE, but is distinct from both. The design has visible lugs, with a smooth housing shape that curves where the watch band meets the body. It does not have the stark circular "puck" shape of Motorola's 360, nor the rather angular lugs or multi-piece design of the Urbane LTE. This gives the watch a subdued but sporty look. Angelfish has three buttons. Looking at the watch face, one large circular crown button is centered along the right side of the body, with two smaller and shorter circular buttons above and below it. It is unclear what these secondary buttons are for at this time, though you are free to imagine the possibilities. Angelfish is quite thick, at over 14mm in cross-section (around the same as the Urbane LTE), likely owing to a larger battery necessitated by its LTE-ready chipset. The watch's diameter is allegedly 43.5mm, making it substantially smaller than the "large" 46mm Moto 360, but still a bit bigger than the standard 42mm edition. We believe it will come in a matte dark gray finish that may be called "titanium," but it's unclear if other colors will be available. Angelfish will have GPS, LTE, and a heart-rate monitor, giving it the ability to be a true "standalone" Android Wear device. Remember, Google announced standalone Wear apps at I/O with with Wear 2.0. The second, smaller watch is codenamed Swordfish. Speaking generally, Swordfish is reminiscent in basic shape to the Pebble Time Round, of course lacking the Round's obviously massive screen bezel, and also using a different button arrangement. But the overall style of the body and especially the lug design are, in my opinion, quite similar. That said, because it doesn't have the internal screen bezel, the portion of the body surrounding the watch face is larger, and the shape is more gentle and rounded than the Pebble's. Swordfish has a single button centered on the right-hand side of the body, with a more delicate and Apple Watch-like design. The center of the button cap appears to be polished metal, with the bezel of the crown being ridged. Aside from appearing more "raised" out of the body because of the watch's circular shape, the button really is quite similar to the Apple Watch's crown. Swordfish is smaller and thinner than Angelfish, with a body diameter of 42mm and a thickness of just 10.6mm - 0.8mm thinner than the current Moto 360. Granted, it still doesn't have anything on the 7.5mm Pebble Time Round in this regard. Swordfish will allegedly be made available in three colors: silver, titanium, and rose gold. Swordfish lacks LTE or GPS, and it's unclear if it has a heart rate monitor (we are leaning "no"). It appears that, oddly, the larger Angelfish device will not support Google's interchangeable MODE watch bands, because the design of the lugs and band won't allow for it. Swordfish, on the other hand, will definitely be compatible with MODE bands. Both watches will offer Google Assistant integration with contextual alerts. Exactly what that integration entails, we aren't certain, but given Sundar Pichai's comments about Nexus devices receiving more exclusive software features, we're left wondering if these watches will get functionality other Android Wear devices won't. Google may also be working on a brand-new style of watch faces for these devices that will allow much quicker access to notifications, information, or media controls for apps or functions that you commonly use. This will likely be via the new app watchface integration announced as part of Wear 2.0. These quick-access functions would sit below the watch dial, presenting things like your current playback location in a song, the number of unread messages in Gmail, Hangouts unread counts, time in another time zone, the amount of time until your next calendar appointment, your number of steps, and more. Final words The inevitable question with these Google smartwatches is "why?" I'm afraid I don't have a concrete answer for you. But I can speculate. As Android Wear has evolved, manufacturer interest in it has not skyrocketed as Google likely hoped it would. At best, it appears to be holding steady. Once considered Wear's strongest partner, LG has announced no new mainstream Wear device since the old Urbane last spring (the LTE is unashamedly niche with limited availability, and was heavily delayed). The number of new Wear OEMs announced lately has been modest, aside from a few niche fashion products that are unlikely to have a major impact on Wear's distribution. By building its own smartwatches, Google can implement exactly the hardware and features it believes will best demonstrate Android Wear's capabilities. It can also, perhaps, offer a better sales and support experience than Wear's smaller partners. It's possible Google could even utilize economic leverage and sell these watches at a discount with the purchase of an accompanying Nexus phone or, in the case of the mobile data-enabled Angelfish, Project Fi cellular service. But this, again, is speculation - I'm simply trying to walk out some potential reasoning for the existence of these devices in the first place. Perhaps the most obvious and compelling, though? Google's competitors in the hardware space make their own smartwatches, too. Apple and Samsung both are pushing their own watch operating systems and accompanying ecosystems, and perhaps Google feels that Wear's OEM partners simply aren't going to put in the effort necessary to market the platform to consumers. As Samsung's Gear OS grows ever-more compatible with non-Samsung devices and services, too, the threat to Android Wear is all too real. While I doubt there's much of a chance the Apple Watch will be pairing to your Android phone any time soon, Google does let you use Wear with iOS, and Google-branded smartwatches would likely be the most visible such devices to Apple users. Whatever the reason, we feel confident Google is building these watches, though time of release, MSRP, and their current level of development remain unknown to us. It is our assumption that Google will attempt to push these watches alongside the upcoming Nexus phones, but we don't believe they'll be unveiled at the same time, but rather at a later date. Given Wear 2.0 is still in early previews, the watches not coming until after the phones would make sense. We'll let you know as we learn more.

TypoCorrecto Please launch with the Nexus devices this year. Jumanji242 And please add NFC to Android Wear devices so I can use my watch to make payments. David Mendívil taking your phone out of your pocket is too hard? Heiro78 it's not too hard. it would just be more convinient/ provide a better case to get an android wear watch. kalehv Would it make a payment accidentally/maliciously? Cause on phone, you have to unlock it. maybe it can provide a button on watch-screen that you HAVE to tap to approve. But I want this too :D Heiro78 hmm good point. probably would have to long press the watch face to activate NFC for payment. or maybe one of those lugs would be dedicated to it as a button? kalehv Oh wait, I think android wear supports pattern lock Adil Tajgeer it does. apple (iirc) doesn't require a pin to pay on the apple watch. you authenticate the card when adding it, and as long as the watch stays on your wrist, it remains unlocked and ready for payment. if you take it off, then you need to enter a pin to access anything on the watch (or unlock it with your phone) kalehv so if someone touches a payment machine to your wrist (i know probably extreme case but just for a sake of discussion) apple watch just goes ahead and makes a payment? I have never used apple watch, so i am not much aware of how it works with Apple Pay. Adil Tajgeer I haven't used my Apple watch in a while but iirc you have to hold the crown or double click it first to bring it up Jumanji242 Exactly - contactless payments on smartwatches has been solved before on other platforms and I don't think Google or Apple are shy about ripping off ideas from competing platforms. I have no insight into the complexity of making NFC payments on Wear happen, but I'm nonetheless hopeful that it's on the Wear product roadmap somewhere. Midnitte Or could just add voice recognition 🤷 JG But if the watch has NFC, you wouldn't actually need to have a phone with you. Android Pay would run on the watch directly and could use it's LTE connection to transmit whatever data is required. I'm thinking, for example, a summer vacation at the beach. You wouldn't need to worry about not having pockets in your bathing suit to store your phone or wallet. Just strap the watch around your wrist and your good to go (especially if the watch is properly water resistant). When you stop off some where for lunch or to pick up a souvenir all you'd have to do is tap your wrist to the PoS & bam, you've paid, Heiro78 this needs to happen David Ruddock god I hope so, but we don't have anything indicating that at this point. Scott I'll just take any form of Android Pay in Canada please... OligarchyAmbulance Pixel, Pixel C, rumored in-house phone, these watches. It sounds like Google's making an effort to make themselves a hardware company. My dreams are coming true! TravisBoone Yeah I've been waiting... slowly they been pumping out pieces of hardware to test the waters. I said awhile ago they need to be more like Apple in the sense that they get their own in house phone production going. ToasTd I'm glad you said it or else it may never have happened. TravisBoone HAHAHA ToasTd I'm glad you said it or else it may never have happened. TravisBoone Yeah I've been waiting... slowly they been pumping out pieces of hardware to test the waters. I said awhile ago they need to be more like Apple in the sense that they get their own in house phone production going. RajivSK Don't get your hopes up too high.. I mean, too often they had some cool hardware and pulled it because they decided the world needs more messaging apps... Smanny I hope they make these watches Daydream VR controllers as well. Since all Android Wear watches come with accelerometers and gyroscopes. That would be totally cool. Валерий Бабанин Watches can't be VR controllers too Ricardo Why Not? Валерий Бабанин How?! Smanny What the hell do you think is in Google's Daydream VR controller? It has an accelerometer and a gyroscope as well as a touch pad. So clearly an Android Wear watch could also do the same thing. Валерий Бабанин Well, if you think that smartwatch can be used as VR controller(image above), let Google know that. I just can't even imagine that Randroid Then you, sir, have no imagination. A watch would work much better than that thing in my imagination. As already stated, watches already have all of the necessary sensors. The controller you pictured has 2 physical buttons, my watch has 1. It's not hard to add another button to future watches. (Most non-smart watches have at least 2 physical buttons.) And the watch is already on your wrist, so sensing hand motion would be natural. Sounds like a very logical solution to me. Валерий Бабанин Buttons and touches should be working with the same hand where watch is placed. However, you need 2 controllers. Who will buy 2 watches for using them instead of controllers? Randroid So 1 watch and 1 controller? I stick to my assertion that it is probably the best logical solution to a VR controller. Валерий Бабанин Controllers always go in pair. And what about "Buttons and touches should be working with the same hand where watch is placed."? Randroid I see that you have formed your opinion and nothing that anyone says or does could ever change your mind. (Short of maybe a Google engineer being on here saying "Hey, that's a good idea!") So enjoy your trolling :-) Валерий Бабанин Trolling? No. I will change my mind if someone will tell me how is this possible An-Nusantarani well, they can be VR hand-sensors at least. Your phone in the right hand, and the watch on the left. And do some VR sword-and-shield swashbuckling. Jordan Na So true C64 My dreams are about naked hot women, not about a big watch. KzX So do I. Ha Ha M.e.Puente Yeeeaaaah, I'm going to need you to go ahead and make a quality Nexus branded Android TV and VR unit while you're at it, Google.. thaaanks danieleran Remember when Google tried to do that before? Acquired Motorola, lost billions, abandoned ship. Acquired Nest, lots billions, accomplished nothing, in flames. Acquired robotics firms, lost money, gave up. Google isn't really good at hardware. Infiniti M56x Watches can't be VR controllers too! 7-down "Google is building" - Seriously, just give us a Pixel Phone! Heiro78 What's a pixel phone? the project ara thing? 7-down No, just an imaginary phone that Google fanboys like myself are waiting for... http://i.makeagif.com/media/2-04-2016/dzfGaP.gif Heiro78 oh, so a 5.5in screen, 5 aH, 3 GHz, 8 GB ram 128 GB storage, water proof!, shock proof, IR blasting, NFC having, modular, mega phone? Brad make it 6" and wireless charging. sam bowlby No, that's the Saygus V^3... coming soon! (pre-order now!) sam bowlby No, that's the Saygus V^3... coming soon! (pre-order now!) BetterWithRoot ...with front facing speakers Badouken Google has the chromebook pixel (a laptop built by Google) and the pixel c (a tablet built by Google). So people like myself are hoping they will expanding to making a "pixel phone" that is 100% made in house at Google no OEM's involved. yeah Ara is a thing but its not ment to be super premium like the pixel line is. syxbit Pixel Phone with a new Nvidia SoC. saf1927 NVIDIA in the mobile space is crap. blassster This is probably what the delayed HTC watch turned into, released alongside the HTC Nexus phones. Dom Apice Probably not but still a neat theory person Goodbye, Moto. It was nice while it lasted. someone755 What was it, 2 years? Oh well... Shellyman 16K My wrist is ready. Red5 LMAO perfect response to this article. Shellyman 16K I know right! :D Никита Кабаков stop typing Shellyman 16K No... senor_heisenberg ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) abc To wank off ? Corey Watford I think Nexus branding is Dead, based on the info yesterday on the Sailfish and Marlin phones and the "G" logo, I have a good feeling this may be the end of the Nexus branding and the beginning of the Google brand. David Ruddock Eh, it's possible. But for now we're still leaning "Nexus" on the phone branding. Sundar literally used the word Nexus several times when describing their future strategy at the recode conference, so unless he was deliberately trying to throw off rumors of a rebrand, we think Nexus is here for now. I'm not saying plans couldn't have changed, though. We just don't have information suggesting they have. Suicide_Note At some point in the next year or two, most likely. This may be the last batch of devices to bear the Nexus imprint. saf1927 It could be complementary. Samsung has the "Galaxy" brand, Apple has the "iPhone" brand. Google has the Nexus brand. They can't call the phone "Google", can they? Cory Wilson Bet the final models will have the nexus logo, first leaks never have the logos Scofabear NFC or GTFO. CMON GOOGLE!!! how are androidwear android pay payments not a thing!! D4niel Perhaps an existing patent prevents them? Scott Even if there was no patent, they would find a way to sue Google... You know the 'they' I'm talking about... Bill Mattheis Oh stop it. Apple is by far not the only one doing mobile payments. Scott I never said or implied that... Apple doesn't care if they do something first or not, they just want to take every advantage they can, including their patent trolling. Bill Mattheis That's why they are suing alllll the other guys. Scott They just sue everyone over everything, their anti-competitive nature is a major reason a left their ecosystem years ago. Progression and competition are good things... Bill Mattheis That's simply inaccurate. Scott Just saying something is inaccurate doesn't make it the truth. I stated an opinion, then two facts. Agree or don't, that's fine, it doesn't change the 'accuracy' of the comment. RN Who are they suing, then? Dear Fanboy, Android Wear devices don't have Android Pay, because it costs money to put the feature there. Scott lol Mayoo You mean like they are not the only one doing this? Yet they sued. http://betanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Apple-slide-to-lock.jpg Christopher Bement Implying apple is the only major company to sue Google over patents. Adil Tajgeer it hasn't stopped samsung. samsung pay works on the gear 2 right? Bill Mattheis This is what I mean. Proof to the opposite. I don't mean to jump down Scott's throat over his comment but I'm exhausted with these generic "so-and-so will just do this!' comments. The 'Apple will never allow this' is just as annoying as 'oh...and have Google steal all my data??'. Scott I honestly didn't intend to start some kind of flaming debate, it was intended to be a joke, if not at least a little true. Bill Mattheis Me either. We disagree on the truth behind it but that's fair enough. Scott I don't know about you, but I am sick to death of the whole "You hate me, I hate you because we like different companies and what they do." thing. Sometimes I just want to say a joke, or state an opinion, with no intention of it being a big thing, so I'm sorry (Canadian detected) if I triggered you. Bill Mattheis No I'm right there with you. I think that's why I jumped on your comment. It came across to me wrong, but that's kind of the drawback of text. The whole Google vs Apple thing among fans is ridiculous, especially with the amount of things they are actually working together on. Everyone should be able to love whatever tech they like. Jumanji242 No, not in the US. It probably works in South Korea where Samsung has more of a presence, but in the US, Samsung Pay is not working on the Gear S2, unfortunately. Adil Tajgeer it hasn't stopped samsung. samsung pay works on the gear 2 right? Leeroy Jenkins The main issue with Android Wear is that one if its main features - Google Now still does Jack shit outside the US even so many years after the release. Nobody wants a 350$/€/£ Weather and notification device on their wrist. philosopher_Mk So now Google is a hardware company? Filipe Santos Hardware company for 2 years device updates (lol)..... My LG G Watch R is still happy... :) bjs @David Ruddock: I commend you for the disclaimer you put. To me, that's responsible reporting. SamMobile, on the other hand, boasts their "exclusive" reports which turn out to more gossip and rumors than anything. They never make a retraction or correction. Suicide_Note That's why AP is the best place for Android news. Mark555055 do it and give me android pay on wear Victor Souza As long as its got just pricing and market availability worldwide, I'm all IN David Hyman My first gen moto 360 has stopped working so the timing of this is perfect! James Briano My beautiful Baume & Mercier continues to function flawlessly. David Hyman Sadly they don't make a Android wear watch! My omega seamaster has been running strong for nearly 2 decades :D Brad Man, I'm ditching the moto 360 mostly because I want the mode bands, but don't want the crummier version of the nexus watch. Damn. cadtek91 "crummier" version? Well do some thinking: are you actually going to use LTE and GPS on the watch, do you ever go anywhere without your phone anyways? Brad Fair point... but I see myself bringing BT headphones instead of a phone some days. Why not? Eumelanin Knight Less than $250, AMOLED screen, heartrate monitor, NFC and I'm interested by default. I wonder if these could be the first to have those new Qualcomm chips. Greg Macek If they can keep it at $300 somehow for the higher end model with GPS/LTE, I'm definitely interested. With very little interest from manufacturers to include GPS for run/bike tracking and no word from Sony on a Smartwatch 4, I'm sticking with my SW3 for as long as possible. Jovie Brett Bardoles Still hoping for a new Nexus tablet this fall, please Google 🙏 David I love the fact Google might start manufacturing their own projects, lets them have more control over everything and it might limit fragmentation. I do wish project Soli would be ready around the time these release. rgao007 These are still a bit thick. Are Qualcomm's Wear chips not ready yet? backslashV you should create a channel called APleaks. TechGuy22 well looks like i'd just wait for google then i was just about to buy a hawaii or whatever watch Jpx Yes, let the Pixel family be a real thing. My Pixel C comes in tomorrow. I want a Pixel phone so bad, and a pixel watch would be awesome. And for no apparent reason I want a Chromebook Pixel. They are such good looking devices. And so far, I'm not in love with the new Nexus phones. But I wasn't in love with the Nexus 6P, but now I really love that phone Greg Macek I'm just imagining a Pixel phone with that same light bar as the C and Chromebook... Charles Man you guys are burning it up with the exclusive Nexus leaks lately, bravo! Badouken I've been waiting to jump into the android wear market for this exact reason! I will for sure get a android wear watch made by Google! Matt Glad I held myself back from purchasing anything Android Wear. Hopefully this changes things enough for me to get one! Denigrate You're wrong, David, you're very talented. Never give up. David Ruddock MOM I TOLD YOU TO WAIT IN THE CAR Lateef Alabi-Oki Android Police, spoiling Google launches since 2009. Guys, have mercy on Google, and leave them one surprise this year. doge you've been killing it with the leaks! youareme7 the lte thing just doesn't interest me in the slightest and all that added thickness is annoying to support it. Would be much nicer if the other version of the watch had GPS and heart rate, that would be the one Snowbooks1419 I wonder if these would be Nexus- or Pixel-branded (or something new?) If Google builds them themselves, then under the current naming scheme, I would imagine they would be Pixel-branded. However, I could also see Google starting to reserve the Nexus name for phones and small tablets, the Pixel name for large tablets and laptops, and perhaps a new name for smartwatches. Abraham I was considering updating my Moto 360 to v2 when it dropped in price, but now I might just wait and see how this plays out. Kinda wish the non-LTE was the same, just without the LTE. I carry my phone everywhere, so I have no need for a standalone watch. dcdttu Another way to keep people from being interested in Wear: release 2 watches that have features like Assistant that no previous watch will ever get. That will make the Huawei Watch on my wrist the last Wear device I use. humulos GOOD! I would love an Urbane LTE, but they are annoying to purchase and freaking expensive. Google produced a top-of-the-line tablet for 200 dollars, they can do the same for smartwatches! BBpost Where is the NFC???????? Gian Paolo Vecchi Google is going fishing? mattcoz Every Nexus device has had a fish codename. Darren Meier Never mind. Forgot Occam was also Mako. person Your description of swordfish sounds a lot like this https://www.android.com/static/2016/videos/wear/mode/scroll.mp4 https://www.android.com/wear/mode/ Chris Sanner annnnd there goes any desire I had to buy a moto 360 sport. Midnitte I just want to know why they're so against NFC and Android Pay integration. You'd think support for standalone apps would be a pretty nice support structure for it. JD Why? Because OEM's didn't make as much money as they thought they would and they have a hard enough time making money on phones... Why? Because OEMs are dicks when it comes to updating phones, and now smart watches. Why? Because Google doesn't even want to set an example and commit to a long life cycle. Why? Because Google doesn't want to alienate OEMs by making devices that are too awesome and too well supported. Why? Because FU that's why. mattcoz Over 14mm thick? Yikes. Hopefully the larger battery will let it last 2 days like my GWR, otherwise I'm not interested. Glich Great my moto360 battery life is slowly approaching the point where I will no longer be able to use with out a mid day re-charge. by oct i will most likly be ready for upgrade. Robin I will also most defiantly upgrade from my original Moto 360, but my battery is actually doing quite fine. Do you use ambient screen? Glich ya if my battery life gets an hour or 2 shorter it will be going off. surethom Swordfish needs to be 40mm diameter & NEEDS a heart rate monitor. Google fit app NEEDS a large update it needs to integrate Sleep data. Marty As long as they don't have flat tires, I'm in. Droon Two questions: 1.) How does LTE work on smartwatches? If I was going for a run, could I pop out the SIM card on my phone and put it into my smartwatch and have LTE? I think I know the answer, I just want to be sure. 2.) Has Sony ever officially confirmed a Sony Smartwatch 4? The Smartwatch 3 seems like the device I want, but I read rumors that there is a Smartwatch 4 in the works. I know you shouldn't keep waiting for new tech because new tech always keeps coming, but I am in no rush to get a smartwatch. Anthony Castanza If they fuck the Huawei Watch on this I'm going to be pissed. There is no reason it shouldn't get all the same features as the Swordfish device. It does bode well that the Android Wear 2.0 update is available for the Huatch though. itamargs The reason i don't buy smartwatch is POOR BATTERY. AT LEAST 3 days "always on" screen time is a Must. Worried about my phone battery is enogh. I dont need a ‪watch‬‏ to worry about to. "Garmin" makes good smartwathes with great battery. I hope that Google will figure it out to. battery that can handle bearly 2 days smartwathes is just a bad joke. Captain_Invisible "It appears that, oddly, the larger Angelfish device will not support Google's interchangeable MODE watch bands, because the design of the lugs and band won't allow for it." They're probably putting antennas and stuff in the band like others (Moto, LG?) have done, right? Cory Wilson Why? Well Motorola isn't exactly still supporting the original 360 are they? Everybody thought Google would be providing updates like chromebooks but the only difference is OEMs can't skin Android wear, they still are in charge of support and still are failing bad so it's s good call Валерий Бабанин Moto 360 has a TI OMAP proccesor Cory Wilson Well if the jackasses thought it was good enough for a smartwatch they should be providing updates for it! Валерий Бабанин Yes, they make this mistake a second time. First time it was Moto X 2013 Daniel Gherard Finally! Found my first Smartwatch. Any chance it will come with project Soli? Like the prototype shown in I/O. Blake I want a smart watch but my scrawny wrists look dumb with them. The smaller 360 isn't bad. If the Nexus one is that size or maybe thinner/smaller then I may finally get one. Google needs to stop being so terrified of the OEMs and do some of this stuff. Has Microsoft suffered from the surface line? VAVAMk_2 So glad we get Nexus watches but no update to the Google Voice app or service in years... Rahde Jones Didnt verge have a video about a google smartwatch https://youtu.be/jWNebDDmuXc JG Google needs to port WiFi Assistant (& the Project Fi app?) to Wear so Angelfish (at least when used with a Project Fi SIM) can bounce onto open WiFi networks just like our phones. The Google VPN would be nice to have as well, but I could live without if needed. While not mentioned in the article, I'm going to assume it has decent water resistance rating (IP68), and a decent sized battery (at least a full day with LTE active) maybe "borrowing" Casio's monocromatic mode they say will let the phone work for a month (even if the LTE radio knocks it down to just a week). NFC would be a nice addition (NFC would be much better N than Nougat, imho). Also needs to have a screen that can be read in sunlight. Icing on the cake would be to have the encryption system from Project Fi embedded in the watch. Its housed inside of a microSD card, so it shouldn't take up that many Zs. But throwing everything coming in or out of the phone through a strong encryption scheme would be incredibly useful to have. John Bakers All Apple Watch and iPhone lovers I highly recommend using this awesome Apple Watch app to easily monitor your iPhone battery charge from the wrist: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/watchmybattery/id1024068907 Carlos Pimentel check out our version review giving the credits to AndroidPolice at http://goo.gl/S8znkt Mark Weiner I wouldn't consider it unless I could answer my phone from the watch or make phone calls and speak directly into the watch. I think LG might have one on the market right now, but , it doesn't work with Project Fi, only Verizon and AT& T. If the only functions are reading text messages or emails and looking at the calendar etc., , then, that's a lot of money not much functionality. Maybe I'm wrong, please let me know. Andrew Please let one of these be waterproof and let Fit get upgraded to track pool laps. Swimmers are consistently second class citizens. 😞 Raiders12 Ermahgerd....could Google itself be the reason I finally get a wearable? They're the reason I got my first smartphone and have been a Nexus user ever since....Nexus watch plzzzz Sean Boon These round smart watches just look lame. The Sony ones were great. Chris I hope so. I'm ready to upgrade from my gear live but the current watches are not much of an upgrade at all... JG Any indication if either's storage will exceed the 4GB standard? We wouldn't need anything too excessive (like 256GBs)* but with Wear 2.0 allowing the watch to function on its own & have apps installed on it directly (rather than living on the phone)... 4GB might start to become rather cramped, especially with the OS probably taking a majority of the available space. *Though (as long as it wasn't too expensive) I wouldn't turn down that much storage... Especially if we could get a WiFi Direct app that'd allow the watch to replace the USB flash drives we use to use... With it attached to your wrist, you'd never forget & leave it plugged into the box in the computer lab... JG Another feature that could be nice to have -- an active FM radio. It'd work well as part of the health tracking suite as a lot of gyms use FM to broadcast TV audio. And would allow the user to "stream" content to their device without using their data or having to store MP3s locally. Plus FM could be useful for localized emergencies. Lower frequency bands means farther transmission ranges (so towers could be outside the affected area transmitting in). And unlike cell towers, there is no congestion issues regardless of how many may be listening to a certain frequency. Hadr The Anglefish with LTE, GPS, and heart rate monitor is apparently aimed at runners and athletes. The round screen is a disappointment in that respect. But far more important is the display technology. Is Anglefish using E-ink, Mirasol, transflective LCD or some other display technology that allows it to be easily read in bright sunlight? If not, then it is pointless to market it to runners and sportsmen for outdoor activities. I hope that David Ruddock and other writers will be more cognizant of this issue in the future when writing articles about smart watches for the athletic and outdoor market. mcored Will these be announced on 4th? Chewieez I'm also interested to hear if there is an update to this rumor, 2.5 months later. I've searched the web but this article seems to be the only source. Post Stupid Thank your information......freshers Eduardo Quintero I think Android Wear has potential, but they are going for the wrong markets. These devices should be into 3 main categories: fitness, fashion, and medical. As a person in the medical field, I don't have time to be looking at my phone whenever it vibrates. But my Moto 360 lets me know what my notifications are while I'm running back and forth. Fitness already has a nice niche filled by Garmin and Fitbit. But Android can squeeze its way in by making those kind of features a key focus instead of an afterthought. Fashion is a somewhat more difficult beast to conquer. I agree that ASUS, Moto, and even Huawei make beautiful watches. But for Wear to succeed in that high end market, it has to partner with companies like Fossil, Rolex, and other high end watch manufacturers. The price will be outrageously expensive and the value for money will be non existent. But just for the label alone, it will succeed. But Fossil has to make an effort to at least include the best screen possible and they'll be fine. Just my humble opinion.

The new cable will span approximately 9,000 kilometers, and its two fiber pairs provide a design capacity of around 18 terabits per second (Tbps), with the option to expand in the future. At 18 Tbps, INDIGO provides enough capacity for people in Singapore and Sydney to join 8 million simultaneous high-definition Google Hangout video conference calls. Alcatel Submarine Networks will construct the cable, which is expected to be completed by mid-2019. Google has now invested in five submarine cables in the Asia-Pacific region and seven overall. By investing in these cables, the company hopes to better compete with other cloud providers and consumer internet companies.

Skip to content Fone Arena The Mobile Blog Menu Main Site Phones Gadgets About Media Coverage Advertising Contact Tip Us Twitter FB Youtube Google Play Music All Access goes live in India, free trial for 1 month, Rs. 89 per month after that Google Play Music went live in India back in September last year to upload songs from your library and purchase songs separately, but it did not launch All Access at that time. Google Play Music All Access also called Subscription has finally gone live in India today. This offers free unlimited streaming and downloads of millions of songs, personalized recommendations without ads, unlimited skips and choice of songs, albums, and playlists. You can already upload up to 50,000 songs from your collection to Play Music and stream it for free. Podcasts is not available in India yet. Google says that Google Play Music offers a music catalogue of over 40 million songs. Google also offers free trial of Google Play Music subscriptions for 30 days. After the free trial you need to pay Rs. 89 per month, which is a limited period offer that you will get only when you sign up before May 18, 2017 or within the first 45 days. Price might increase after that. This is currently the cheapest music subscription service in India. Apple Music costs Rs. 120 per month, while Wynk Music, Saavn Pro, Gaana+ and Hungama subscription cost Rs. 99 per month each. Commenting on the launch, Elias Roman, Lead Product Manager, Google Play Music said: With Google Play Music subscription, Indian subscribers can listen to their favourite music across a variety of languages, including Hindi, English, Tamil and more. This music can be accessed from any device with your Google Account. To make the experience deeply personalized, we’ve plugged into Google’s understanding of context and machine learning to recommend the right music at the right moment based on each listener’s preference, place and activity.

Tech Tools: Streaming device eyes growing ultra high-definition market Ciara O'Brien   Chromecast Ultra is as easy to use as any of Google’s streaming devices that have gone before it Product name: Google Chromecast Ultra Price: €79.0 Where to buy: https://www.google.com/chromecas Website: www.google.com/chromecas Thu, Apr 6, 2017, 06:03 First published: Thu, Apr 6, 2017, 06:03     When the Google Chromecast first came out in 2013, it caused a stir. Not only could it turn your run of the mill TV into a smart TV, but it did so with minimal fuss – and minimal cost. At under $40 – later, when it launched in Ireland, €40 – it was an instant hit. We’ve been through a few versions since then. The stick is gone, replaced by a more eye-pleasing round dongle. But it still does essentially the same thing: connects to your TV through a HDMI cable, powered by a USB connection, and allows you to stream content, games and other media to your TV through your Android tablet, phone or Chrome browser. Then came the Chromecast Ultra. It looks very similar to its sibling: round, plugs into the HDMI port. But there are some important differences. The Chromecast Ultra is built to deal with ultra high-definition streaming, tying in with the current trend towards 4K that we are seeing in everything from our TVs to our phones and cameras. The power supply in the box has an ethernet port built in to it so you don’t have to suffer through stuttering wifi and slow connection speeds. Plus the upgraded technology inside the Ultra may help with your current set up, even if you are sticking with high-definition for now. A few things to note though. There’s little point in splashing out on the souped up Chromecast Ultra if you don’t have a 4K screen to play your content on. It would still be nice to have but, let’s face it, you aren’t going to get the full benefit out of it. Those beefed-up insides will help with your regular HD content, but not enough alone to justify junking the old Chromecast and splashing out on a new one. So 4K is really the pulling point here. It’s worth noting that the cost of 4K TVs is coming down as the technology becomes more prevalent and the manufacturers become ever keener to flog you a new one. You may find yourself investing in a 4K TV in the not so distant future, even if you have no intention of replacing all your content with ultra HD equivalents. On that case, having the Chromecast will open you up to Netflix in 4K and so on. Chromecast Ultra is as easy to use as any of Google’s streaming devices that have gone before it. Even getting it connected is simple to tackle. If you are a 4K convert, you’ll see a noticeable difference in picture quality. And if you are clinging to high-definition you may see a speed boost if you are using the ethernet port. It’s still a great product from Google, and it’s still just as flexible; Chromecast doesn’t ban Apple’s devices from connecting to it, for example. The good: If you want to future-proof your home entertainment setup, the Chromecast is a cost-effective way to do it. It’s easy too; simply plug it into your TV and hook it up to your broadband. The built in ethernet port means you can hook your Chromecast up directly to your broadband hub. That means no wireless lag, particularly when you are streaming ultra high-definition content, which is typically a major bandwidth hog. And because the Chromecast platform is so flexible, you can add to its functions as you go along. The not so good: At €79, the Chromecast Ultra doesn’t look quite as much of a bargain as its less swanky sibling. You have to weigh that extra cost against the benefits of having 4K on your streaming device; for some, it just won’t be worth it. The rest: If you are going to splash out on the Chromecast Ultra – and it’s about twice the price as the regular one, don’t forget – you have to have the means to watch 4K content, and the access to ultra high-definition content. If you are on Netflix, that isn’t a problem; ditto if you are shooting your own footage, although beware of becoming the 4K bore. No one really needs to see every moment of your two-week holiday in ultra high-definition. Honestly. The verdict: If you are considering upgrading your Chromecast to something more substantial, then the Ultra is a good bet. But only if you plan on shifting to ultra high-definition at some point in the future.

Uber’s self-driven Volvo SUV was flipped on its side after a collision in Tempe, Arizona, US, in March this year. Reuters/Fresco News/Mark Beach Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger If driverless cars live up to the safety hype, they could result in a significant reduction in the number of court cases dealing with human-related traffic offences. But before we can clear the courts, we will need to have a period where human drivers share the responsibility (both actual and legal) for control of their vehicles. Arriving at the point where fully automated vehicles are on our roads requires us to establish who is legally in control of them. If we don’t, we could find that we have simply replaced one type of legal dispute with another. Traffic offences More than 200,000 people in Australia were found guilty of driving and traffic offences in the 12 months to June last year, according to Australian Bureau of Statistics figures. The most common crimes were driving while intoxicated (71,501 cases) and speeding (16,461 cases). Other offences included failing to obey traffic signs and signals, and careless driving. In some parts of Australia these offences are increasing in frequency, placing a growing burden on our courts. All because of wrongdoing or careless conduct of a human in charge of a motor vehicle. By contrast, fully automated vehicles have established an impressive compliance and safety record, so far. There have been very few reported crashes, although they obviously cause concern when they occur, such as the crash last year that led to the death of the driver of a Tesla car in autopilot mode. Most crashes involving autonomous vehicles are less serious than that, and are due to the errors of other (human) drivers, such as last month’s Uber collision in Arizona and the 16 crashes reported by Google between 2009 and 2015. Google’s cars have been involved in further accidents, including one last February when its autonomous Lexus pulled out into a bus. The safety record of autonomous vehicles is frequently contrasted with research that identifies that more than 90% of regular vehicle collisions are caused by human error. As the number of fully automated cars on our roads increases, we should expect to see a reduction in the number of traffic offences coming before our courts. In Victoria alone these offences currently account for nearly 21,000 cases heard each year in the Magistrates’ Court. Drivers, passengers and ‘chaperones’ The removal of the human driver has the potential to make some criminal charges unnecessary. This could include charges of driving while intoxicated, unlicensed driving, and driving with a disqualified, suspended or cancelled licence. Making these offences redundant in Victoria, for example, would remove about 29,000 cases annually from the Magistrates’ Court. But reform may be necessary to clarify the legal situation. In Victoria the definition of “drives” in the Road Safety Act 1986 includes “to be in control of a vehicle”. Drink and drug driving offences refer to a person who “drives … or is in charge of a motor vehicle”. Would a person who enters a fully automated car that unlocks as they approach it, who gives verbal directions as to their destination (and leaves it to the car to determine the route), be said to be in control or in charge of the car? If that person is not in control of the car, then who is? And what if the vehicle in question is an Uber vehicle, taxi or bus? Who is responsible for the actions of that vehicle – the hirer, the owner or the manufacturer? It is interesting to note that the staff member present in Curtin University’s recently introduced fully automated bus is referred to as a “chaperone”. Curtin University is trialling an electric driverless bus that seats 11 passengers. In essence, a key legal issue will be to determine whether a person present in a fully automated car is more like a driver or a passenger. Tesla’s chief executive Elon Musk said his company will accept liability for fully automated vehicles where a problem stems from a design fault. But he also suggested that in other circumstances, individuals and their insurers may be responsible. Some clarification of the legal position may be required. A report, released by the UK government’s Department for Transport in February 2015, warned that with fully automated vehicles: […] it does not seem reasonable to suggest that the human driver is still responsible for the manner in which the vehicle drives since they may not even be aware of the road environment or the presence of other road users. The transition phase: semi-automated vehicles While fully automated vehicles are not yet freely driving on Australian roads (the Curtain bus is restricted to a specified route), many Australian drivers already use cruise control, electronic stability control, parking assist and advanced braking systems to help them drive their cars. Human drivers can override these automatic settings at any time, and may be required to do so to avoid colliding with cyclists, pedestrians, animals and stationary vehicles – all of which may not be detected by the automated programs. Consequently, manufacturers warn drivers of semi-automated vehicles that they must remain alert and ready to resume control in the case of adverse environmental conditions or unexpected events. Because of this shared responsibility for control of the vehicle, we might expect legal problems in attributing responsibility when something goes wrong. Fault could rest with a human driver who fails to take control when required to do so, or with a manufacturer whose product is faulty. While some car manufacturers – such as Volvo with its Pilot assist – say that drivers bear responsibility for controlling the car even when the semi-automated program is used, the situation might be more complex. It may be that the semi-automated program itself causes the problem. News reports from the US say that federal authorities have already expressed concern that a safety device on a semi-automated car may itself cause accidents. In these situations it may not be so easy for manufacturers to escape liability.

A planned undersea cable nearly 6,000 miles long will carry Google data between Australia and Singapore, with enough capacity to allow for as many as eight million simultaneous HD Google Hangout video calls. Google on Wednesday announced its investment in the Indigo cable project, which will link Perth, Sydney, Singapore, and Jakarta when it's completed in 2019. Undersea cable operator SubPartners and Singaporean and Australian telecom providers Singtel and Telstra are also investing in the cable, which will be built by Alcatel Submarine Networks. Related Google, Facebook to Build Fastest Transpacific Cable Google, Facebook to Build Fastest Transpacific Cable Google isn't saying how much it will spend, although its financial stake and the investments of the other partners are key to getting the Indigo cable built. SubPartners originally announced a Perth-Singapore cable back in 2013, with the intent to finance the construction itself and allow other companies to buy capacity. But SubPartners struggled to attract seed money, according to IT News, so it restructured the project to follow the model of other similar undersea cables financed by the companies that will actually use it. Indigo is Google's fifth undersea cable project in the Asia-Pacific region, and it will mainly carry traffic from Google Cloud, which the company is positioning to compete with the likes of Microsoft and Amazon. With a capacity of 18 terabits per second, Indigo will be significantly slower than another undersea project that Google, Facebook, and other internet companies are working on to link Hong Kong with Los Angeles. That cable will offer speeds of up to 120 terabits per second, and is scheduled to come online by next year.

Mesh Wi-Fi strings a Wi-Fi connection together with the use of multiple routers to create a more consistent coverage area. Google already has Google WiFi, its own mesh networking solution that lets you add Google WiFi points in a large room. A consistent Wi-Fi access will automatically let users access Google Assistant to the fullest. Launched last year, the Google Home smart speaker was Google’s answer to Amazon Echo. It lets you enjoy music, manage everyday tasks and ask Google questions via voice commands. You can use “Ok Google” command to ask Google Home about the weather, news and more. The built in search feature on Google Home learns from your habits and patterns and knows you overtime. Unfortunately, the report does not reveal any other details about the next generation Google Home device. If the new Google Home device will come with built-in mesh WiFi technology, it will be costlier than the existing version. There is no word on pricing and release date of the next generation Google Home smart speaker.

Ilya Melnikov How Israel’s capital market is financing its gray market Venture investor 83North raises $250 million for its fourth fund 83North, the Israeli-European venture capital firm, said Wednesday it had completed fundraising for a new $250 million fund – its fourth and biggest since the firm was formed 11 years ago. The 83North IV fund brings the firm’s total capital under management to $800 million. Originally known as Greylock Israel, 83North operates from offices in Herzliya and London and partners include Laurel Bowden, Arnon Dinur, Erez Ofer, Yoram Snir, who have backed more than 40 companies, and Gil Goren, who was previously the highest-ranked Israeli executive at U.S. tech company EMC. Ofer’s joining 83North was the reason for the latest fundraising, he told TheMarker. The venture capital firm raised the $250 million in just three months and ended up turning away potential investors, Ofer said, adding, “We could have raised more, but we think we have the right amount – especially if we are going to earn threefold returns.” (Eliran Rubin) Israeli Lior Ron outed as Uber employee named in Google lawsuit Israeli Lior Ron was inadvertently outed this week as the second Uber employee facing a lawsuit from Google. When Waymo – the self-driving car unit of Google parent company Alphabet – filed a suit in February accusing Uber of illicitly acquiring its proprietary self-driving car technology, the suit only publicly named one Uber executive: Anthony Levandowski. But court documents made public on Monday accidentally revealed that the other, previously anonymous, Uber executive in the case is Ron, whose last name was deleted from the papers but not his first name nor his work history. Levandowski and Ron worked at Google before leaving to start the self-driving truck company Otto last May, which they then sold to Uber for $680 million three months later. Ron lists his current position on LinkedIn as “cofounder at Otto.” Waymo claims that Levandowski and Ron allegedly tried to recruit Google employees using confidential information, like salaries and compensation packages. (TheMarker Staff) Becton, Dickinson buys remaining 60% of Caesarea Medical Becton, Dickinson and Company said Wednesday it had acquired the remaining 60% in Israel’s Caesarea Medical Electronics, a maker of portable infusion pump systems for IV and epidural anesthesia and pain management. No financial details of the transaction were released, but the U.S. firm reportedly bought the stake at a $250-million company valuation. “Our relationship with BD has been very successful over the past two years, and this is the next logical step to elevate our infusion technologies,” said Swi Barak, Caesarea Medical’s founder. BD acquired Caesarea in 2015 when it bought CareFusion Corporation, which had bought the Israeli company a year earlier for $100 million. BD said acquiring full control of Caesarea Medical will expand its portfolio of infusion products to include Caesarea’s ambulatory, home and specialty acute care pumps. Caesarea Medical was founded in 1993 by Swi and Anat Barak, and operated out of the public eye until it was bought by CareFusion.

Google Map Maker is officially dead Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/02 8:46am PDTApr 2, 2017 35 Plus 1 on G+ 79 Share on Facebook 59 Share on Twitter Total Shares173 Google News Google Map Maker was introduced back in 2008, as a way for users to make contributions to Google Maps. Features like roads, highways, rivers, and so on could be added to Maps, and users could fill in details about businesses and other specific locations. After some vandalism occurred thanks to Google's poor moderation, the feature was removed entirely, and re-appeared later with less functionality. Google has been working to integrate Map Maker features into Google Maps itself, and announced in November that the independent Map Maker service would shut down. Now Map Maker is officially dead. Google's support page says that most of Map Maker's functionality is already in Maps, and the company will continue to add new features as time goes on.

But... But... Oh wait, I got nothing. Leo Herzog If I have an edit to contribute to a park or college campus boundary, how am I supposed to do that? 😆😄 "Suggest an edit" on the location. Leo Herzog There is no "Suggest an edit" on a polygon like a campus border. 😆😄 Don't have my phone handy... but on desktop you can right click anywhere and "Add a missing place" Leo Herzog I don't really want to add a missing place though... 😆😄 Well, if you want to edit something that already exists, like the polygon of a campus or park, that polygon should have a label that you can click on to suggest an edit. Leonardo Baez Sadly in my country is blocked. There are several errors in street names, and some streets have changed circulation direction. Randroid Try using the "Feedback" button in Maps. Leonardo Baez Limited option only (add missing places) you cannot add or edit streets aRvInD I was proud Regional lead in that program but after whole Android pissing on Apple fiasco, functionality got heavily restricted. i knew they soon will kill this program... iMarbot "Google's support page says that most of Map Maker's functionality is already in Maps"... biggest lie I have heard ALL YEAR Sruly J You must not get out much. ;) Travis Halfman Alternative Facts.

Randroid Actually it's not, it's just done differently. You have to suggest an edit, then your edit is approved or denied. I've done it multiple times within the Maps Android app. Rob Cook The best part is when they deny your edit for being inaccurate and you have to submit a photo to prove your right. caruso81 What does this do to making custom points of interest and uploading to your GPS? (I'm aware GPS units are dead and the mobile phone is the way to go. I'm also aware that US carrier data in Europe is obscenely priced and that I already own a GPS with hundreds of custom POIs loaded onto it.) IVBela What if I want to mark duplicate places? Oh nevermind... Randroid You use the "Feedback" button in Maps Leonardo Baez this is buls*** There are many countries were the only source for trusted information is the comunity. With this change now we cannot change street names, street directions, allowed and prohibited turns, add returns or new road crosses. This is buls*** google. When in hell will you designate a team to do maps of bolivia, or agola or suriname? We the users are the contributors because no one else gives tools or trusted maps as google. And now all the maps will be frozen in time circa 2015 (because for many countries google stopped edits in 2015). I'm mad as hell TannoV If you'd actually read the article, you'd have read that the functionality has been integrated into Google maps. Tomáš Petrík And if you'd actually tried that, you'd have found out that you can only add/edit places like businesses and other POIs. However, it is not possible to rename a street, edit directions and/or turns, etc. modeless And if *you'd* actually tried that, you would have seen that as a Local Guide it is possible to rename a street, edit segment attributes and also report missing roads. Martin I am a local guide, but I can't find how you rename a street. Could you point me in the right direction? Or are you supposed to use the Feedback function? Leonardo Baez I'm local guide level 5 living in Bolivia. Its not possible here abc "No, it's not everything Map Maker had but it's a lot more than you say." lol, so it's not all functionality like Google claims. Let it go fanboys, you're not convincing anyone. roberto.elena Re editing directions and/or turns: There is a workaround for this. I've used it several times, because Map Maker was never available in Spain (one of the 20 or so countries out of 200 that wasn't lucky enough). What you do is set a route between 2 points that pass through that street or a make that turn you want to edit, and then use the feedback tool to report where the problem is. As I said, I've used it several times to correct illegal turns. Leonardo Baez Yeah... But no. You can only add places (business, comerce,etc) I dont know if in the US is avaible the full ediriong options butnoutside the US it is not. abc Fuck off, moron. Upvotes4Bird Thanks to Google's poor moderation? Thanks to shitty users. poop. It was both. Grey Map Maker had a piece of shit moderation community with bullshit, "what we want" rules. Trying to correct an issue is a nightmare. Trying to add something is a nightmare. No way to add building corrections after the vandalism. Trying to add a path that goes by a road is not allowed sometimes - despite tons of these paths existing. And they use Google Street View - despite Google Street View being quite a bit off the ground and giving a warped perspective. I love the idea behind Map Maker, I hate the moderation community and their stupid idea of rules. poop. It's still like this even with the "new" system Grey That is awful news Randroid Unfortunately, without these kinds of rules we get things like what happened in the vandalism instance. Grey They can allow proper trail mapping without it being vandalism. They don't want trails to be used for sidewalks, so if a trail goes near a road sometimes they'll argue it's a sidewalk. But sometimes it's not! And fuck you if you want to discuss it. jdrch Google killed another product users were relying on? No way! Stop the presses! Unheard of! Adrianus AJ Nadeak Map Maker was not working in one country used to live in. I did manage to name a street using Map Maker years ago but then it stopped working. With the country's frantic construction rate, many new roads have been built or redirected and as a result, Google Maps isn't as accurate as my current location. Many roundabouts have been converted to traffic signal intersections and a section of a new ring road is non existent. POI and places can be edited and added within the Maps app so that's not much of an issue. Janet Scott Again bad performance by Google. it's usage mistake by Google again. ToniCipriani ✓pǝᴉɟᴉɹǝʌ Sums up Google. http://i.imgur.com/9TEaodA.gif abc Bad idea. There are entire regions of the world where the only reason Google Maps is of any use is because of Map Maker creations. John Heaton Its rubbish. There are a ton of streets in my town that don't exist in Maps. Some are visible on satellite view. I tried to send info and it doesn't work. Every time I clicked a place on the map it just selected the nearest known road. Nuts Ryan Johnson Google Map Maker was kind of a hunk of shit, but they should have kept it around for a bit longer because as it stands, Google Maps just isn't up to par with the functionality. I can't edit neighborhoods anymore, or trails; and it took me the longest time to figure out how to edit road segments... but even THAT is much more limited. Maybe I'm not receiving the full suite of tools because I'm not signed up as a Local Guide due to my age, but they should really make the options easier to find & have more transparency when reviewing your changes ...

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 6 April 2017 | MYT 11:30 AM Google’s AI hasn’t passed its biggest test yet: hunting hate Massive problem: To detect and police content across YouTube's sprawling library, and ensure ads don't run against questionable content, Google must solve an AI problem no one has cracked yet: automatically understanding everything that's going on in videos, including gesticulations and other human nuances. — AFP An advertiser boycott of YouTube is testing a critical and much-hyped part of Google's future: its prowess in artificial intelligence. Some experts in the field say the technology isn't up to scratch yet, but that if any company can solve the problem at hand, it's the online search giant.  Some of the world's biggest marketers halted YouTube spending last month after ads from large brands were found running alongside hateful and extremist videos. Google parent Alphabet Inc risks losing US$750mil (RM3.32bil) in revenue this year from the debacle, analysts at Nomura Instinet estimated this week. That's less than 1% of projected sales this year, so it can weather the financial storm. But it's likely an incentive for the company to re-direct AI investments and accelerate research efforts already underway.  To detect and police content across YouTube's sprawling library, and ensure ads don't run against questionable content, Google must solve an AI problem no one has cracked yet: automatically understanding everything that's going on in videos, including gesticulations and other human nuances.  A potential solution lies in machine learning, a powerful AI technique for automatically recognising patterns across reams of data – a Google specialty. Chief executive officer Sundar Pichai has pledged to infuse the technology across all its products, and the company touts its abilities in the field to software developers, cloud-computing clients, advertisers and shareholders.  Computer scientists doubt technology alone can expunge offensive videos. “We're not there yet where we can, say, find all extremist content,” said Hany Farid, a Dartmouth professor and senior adviser to the Counter Extremism Project, which has repeatedly called on YouTube to tackle this problem. He recommends companies like Google and Facebook Inc. deploy more human editors to filter content. “Machine learning, AI is nowhere near that yet,” he said. “Don't believe the hype.”  The AI hype machine is running at full speed in Silicon Valley right now, as startups and technology giants like Google, Amazon and Microsoft compete to recruit engineers and scientists skilled in the field.  Google's AI advances sometimes match the hype, but they are not perfect. The company's cloud division recently released a tool (unrelated to YouTube) that breaks videos into their constituent parts, rendering them “searchable and discoverable.” A group of academics published research earlier this week that showed how to deceive this system by injecting images into videos.  Google has used machine learning and other AI tools to master speech, text and image recognition. In 2012, researchers famously got a network of 16,000 computers to teach itself to recognise cats by scanning millions of still images culled from YouTube videos. Understanding entire videos is a lot more difficult. Cats meow, stretch and jump through more than a thousand video frames each minute.  “A video is three dimensional, with two dimensions in space and an additional dimension in time,” said Jiebo Luo, an AI expert at the University of Rochester, who has created text-based hate speech filters for social media like Twitter. “It's a challenge.” Particularly so for something as big as YouTube. It said in 2015 that people uploaded 300 hours of content per minute to the service, making it impossible to screen all videos as they appear.  Two years have passed, so could software now evolve to a point where it dissects every video uploaded online, deciphering the vile from the rest? “It's possible,” said Luo, “especially given the massive computational and people resources that Google has. No other company is in a better position to do that.”  Still, it's not cheap. Video demands advanced algorithms and computing horsepower. Today the industry relies on specialised semiconductors, called graphic processing units, to drive the software. Processing an hour of video typically occupies half the resources of a GPU, said Reza Zadeh, founder of Matroid, an AI startup working on video. A graphics card featuring a high-end chip from market leader Nvidia Corp. sells for about US$500. “The best models are expensive right now,” Zadeh said.  Google spends billions of dollars a year on datacentres, computer servers and the chips that run them. It doesn't say how much of this goes toward YouTube, but the video site is known to be expensive to run.  In AI, Google has even has developed its own hardware, called TensorFlow Processing Units. It recently offered a $30,000 prize for researchers to use its cloud and TPUs, or similar AI tools, to accurately label YouTube videos. Google researchers have applied machine learning software to classify images and audio inside videos for years (is that video tagged as a Prince song really Prince?), while improving recommendations and ad performance. Another part of Alphabet – a group called Jigsaw – is using AI tools in other ways to curb hate speech online.  In a memo to aggrieved YouTube advertisers last week, the company said its machine learning algorithms will improve the precision and classification of videos. However, it also warned that with the volume of content involved this can never be 100% guaranteed.  Classifying what we hear and watch online, together at once, “is a problem that is essentially open,” said Zadeh. “Probably, Google is doing it right now.”  He's probably right. At a conference Google hosted in February, Jeff Dean, head of Google's “Brain” AI research unit, spoke about his team's advances. “The next big domain is video,” he said. — Bloomberg Related Stories You May Be Interested Traffic offenders, watch out – you could lose your licence under Kejara system Co-ordinate donations to prevent surplus and abuse Forest City project: Penalty for China buyers who seek to cancel purchase Where to find a cuddly quokka for your selfie 8 types of runners you meet at a marathon Craft yourself a new career by embracing digital learning Others Also Read Cops nab ‘kidnapped’ nurse and her hubby Opulent abodes in nature’s embrace Turning the spotlight on online brands advertisement Latest News UK increases pressure on Google to remove terrorist content UK and Swedish watchdogs warn of international cyberattack Emirates joins Etihad, Qatar in US cabin laptop ban workaround Australian regulator sues Apple alleging iPhone ‘bricking’ Europe regulator says airlines’ tech ban may compromise safety Most Viewed in Tech Pepsi pulls Kendall Jenner ad after social media backlash Emirates joins Etihad, Qatar in US cabin laptop ban workaround Australian regulator sues Apple alleging iPhone ‘bricking’ Forget Apple; Xiaomi CEO now wants to be more like Costco Europe regulator says airlines’ tech ban may compromise safety Office workers most likely using lunch hour to plan their vacation: Kayak Samsung's foldable smartphone could land this year UK and Swedish watchdogs warn of international cyberattack New travel trends report shows how fliers search and book flights Garmin unveils the Forerunner 935, a GPS sports watch for runners and triathletes Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Google Home has hit the shelves at £129, but how will it fare against its Amazon rivals, the Echo and Echo Dot? By Tom Morgan 6 Apr 2017 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share by email Google’s answer to the Amazon Echo is now available to buy. Its smart hub and wireless speaker is powered by Google Assistant to help you control internet-enabled devices and manage daily tasks. When it comes to buying a smart hub, there are now plenty of models to choose from. This new arrival from Google has lots of nifty tricks up its sleeve, and it joins a family that also includes Samsung SmartThings, the Panasonic Home Hub and Apple’s HomeKit. Read on as we take a closer look at the Google Home, its key features and how it shapes up compared to its rivals. Smart hub reviews – get more from your internet-connected devices How much does Google Home cost? The new smart hub from Google costs £129. On top of that, you have the option to customise the base of the device depending on your style. A fabric base costs £18, while the metal alternative is slightly pricier at £36. Google Home manages to undercut the £150 Amazon Echo, which is no doubt an intentional move to try and one-up its key rival. Visit our Amazon Echo review to find out how it performed in our tests. Home is available now from online retailers including Argos, Currys and John Lewis. You can also grab the wireless speaker from Google’s own online store. Google Home – key features Google Assistant At the heart of Google Home is Google Assistant, which was first spotted on the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones. It’s a voice-powered service designed to help you manage tasks throughout the day. Simply say ‘OK Google’ and the gadget will spring into life, ready to deal with what you throw at it. You can use it to set reminders, for example, or have it play the latest news headlines. Translations, handy unit conversions and music commands are also on board. Once we get Google Home off to our test lab, we’ll be paying close attention to see how well the hub can handle quickfire commands. Control other smart devices As smart hubs evolve, we’re seeing more and more accessories in stores that can make your home that little bit more intelligent. Google Home can pair with smart light bulbs – handy if you want to dim the lights but can’t pull yourself away from the TV. Devices that are plugged into smart switches and plugs can also be turned off remotely, as can compatible thermostats like Nest (right). Music streaming and app support Google Home is compatible with popular music-streaming services including Google Play Music and Spotify (right). In fact, if you already own speakers with Chromecast Audio built in, you’ll be able to use Google Home to link them together for a louder, more powerful sound. In theory, you could have music playing through several speakers in your home that live in different rooms, all talking to each other via Google’s new hub. It’s worth noting that the Amazon Echo doesn’t support music playback to multiple devices, however. Of course, there are loads of music-related voice commands that Home can deal with. You can ask to hear specific songs or playlists from your own collection, or have radio stations play live through the speaker. It could serve you well as an alarm clock. Google Home vs Amazon Echo The new Google Home and the Amazon Echo are both voice-powered hubs, but there are several differences between them. For starters, the Echo is controlled using physical buttons on its top, whereas Home uses a slightly more sophisticated touch-sensitive panel. Google Home is powered by Google Assistant, but the Echo uses Amazon’s Alexa. One key strength of Google Assistant (which we first spotted during our Pixel review) is that it copes very well with follow-up questions – something that can be hit or miss on the Echo. For example, if you ask ‘How old is Big Ben?’ and then go on to ask ‘How tall is it?’, Google Assistant will know what ‘it’ is. Amazon’s hub and wireless speaker uses Bing as its search engine of choice, but we’ll have to wait for our test results to see which device offers the better user experience. A key strength of Google Home is the hub’s ability to draw on information from your other Google apps. As it’s a part of the Google ecosystem, you can use Home to check Gmail, Google Maps, Google Calendar and more. It’s a nice bonus if you’re looking for a quick overview of your day. Both Google Home and the Amazon Echo can stream music but, unsurprisingly, the Echo chooses to showcase Amazon Prime Music, while Home has Play Music. The latest smart hub reviews Every smart hub we test is put through its paces in our lab to see if it deserves a spot in your living room. We take a close look at how easy each smart hub is to set up for the first time, what other devices they’re compatible with and how they can effectively offer privacy and security. We’ve had our hands on a range of products from big-name brands including Panasonic, Samsung and Swann, with the most expensive model costing over £200. Even if you’re a buyer on a budget, there are still some hubs to consider. The Amazon Echo Dot (right), for example, is available for just £50. For the price you pay, you’ll get a voice-controlled home assistant that won’t make your wallet too unhappy. You’ll have to head over to our full Amazon Echo Dot review to see how the device scored in our lab. To find out which smart hubs breezed through our tests, head over to our smart home hub reviews.

YouTube unveils app that allows you to watch videos offline By Neha Alawadhi , ET Bureau| Updated: Apr 06, 2017, 01.51 AM IST READ MORE ON » youtube go | YouTube | Google Play Store | Google | Alphabet Inc A beta version of the app has been released in the Google Play Store in India. Related More big brands pull ads from YouTube in widening boycott Smartphone apps may be secretly communicating, breaching your security NEW DELHI: Google has made a test version of YouTube Go, the offline-first, shareable video product that it announced in India last year, available for download on the Google Play Store from Wednesday. YouTube Go was launched by Google at its ‘Google for India’ event in September last year. “It’s relatable, with fresh and relevant video recommendations tailored to your preferences; the app is designed to be offline first and improve the experience of watching videos on a slower network; it gives you more control over data usage, by providing choice and transparency into the amount of data spent on streaming or saving videos,” Jay Akkad, YouTube product manager, said in a blogpost. Akkad told ET in an interaction the app got 20,000 users in a matter of hours, when it was launched in an invitation-only mode, and over the past few months, YouTube invested in improving the maturity and performance of the product. “Some things we’ve learned in the run-up to this beta release include making the home screen fresher and more relevant for users, so they can find amazing videos easily.

Get access business Google’s cloud branding stinks, say Germans Mark Tighe April 6 2017, 12:01am, The Times Google wants to call its cloud service Team Drives, but has been taken to court by a company called TeamDriveCHRIS RATCLIFFE/GETTY IMAGES A small German technology company has asked the High Court in Dublin to grant an EU-wide injunction to prevent Google from using the name “Team Drives” for its new cloud service for businesses. TeamDrive Systems Gmbh, a German company that had a turnover of €800,000 last year, has accused Google of deliberately trying to misappropriate its name, which has been a registered EU trade mark since 2006. TeamDrive said Google’s launch of a new collaborative service for users of Google Drive, called Team Drives, is identical to the service it offers except that its product has end-to-end encryption. It wants an interlocutory injunction barring Google from using the “Team Drives” name for its “inferior” service throughout the EU pending a full hearing of the trade… Want to read more?

The tech behemoth boasts that the chips it developed in-house to process AI apps are 15 to 30 times faster than today's conventional CPUs and GPUs. Google says its chips -- called TPUs, for tensor processing units -- are also more energy-efficient, which means they'll use less power to complete a given task.

But Google isn't the only one pursing AI chips. Qualcomm is building AI technology into its mobile chips, which could give machine-learning tasks a boost on your phone when you don't want to wait for a Google server on the other side of the network. Nvidia already is a major AI player in data centers. And Intel's Nervana group is working on custom chips that are designed to train artificial intelligence technology faster.

By Blair Hanley Frank U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | Apr 5, 2017 4:34 PM PT Credit: Google More like this How much data can a fiber carry? Facebook and Nokia are pushing it Three technologies that could demolish slow internet What is FASTER? Just a super speedy undersea internet cable Video Choosing technologies to drive digital transformation Google is investing in another massive undersea fiber-optic cable as a part of its plans to build out network connectivity around the world. The company announced Wednesday that it is helping to fund a project called Indigo, which will connect Jakarta, Singapore, Perth and Sydney to one another. The cable will run for approximately 9,000 kilometers (almost 5,600 miles) and provide a capacity of roughly 18Tbps (bits per second). It's being built to bring users more connectivity in a region that has growing internet needs. Google has now invested in five submarine cables in the Asia-Pacific region and seven overall. By investing in these cables, the company hopes to better compete with other cloud providers and consumer internet companies. Alcatel Submarine Networks will build the cable, and Google expects it to be finished by the middle of 2019. Other Indigo investors include cable company SubPartners and ISPs AARNet, Indosat Ooredoo, Singtel and Telstra. Only Google and the other investors will be able to use Indigo, though Singtel and Telstra will be able to sell capacity to their customers as part of their telecom businesses.  Google and other users of the cable will be able to expand its capacity with future technology to keep up with growing needs. Indigo has two fiber pairs, one-third as many as the trans-Pacific FASTER cable turned on last year, where Google was also an investor. Interestingly, Indigo’s roughly 9,000-kilometer run puts it on par with the length of FASTER. It's that long partly because of the curving path it needs to take to connect the four cities along its length.

A report came out this morning suggesting that Google is working on a future device that merges the Google Home and a mesh Wifi router. Would you be interested in picking up a future Google Home device that could be used as an access point? Google Home is apparently so useful that people are purchasing multiple of them to place around their homes. This type of setup is very similar to how Google attempted to sell users on Google Wifi. Having a Home placed in every corner of a household with mesh networking functionality built-in would not only give users stronger internet connections but also provide better access to the Google Assistant. Unfortunately, though, the report did not include any sort of pricing or release date information as to when the new device would be available to purchase. Assuming that the project is successful and comes to market, it would be logical that Google would release it in late 2017, a year after the current Home was announced. As for pricing, Google would most likely need to sell these Homes in bundles so they might be priced similarly to the current three pack of Google Wifi, available for $300. Would you be interested in purchasing multiple next-generation Google Homes if it meant getting a stronger internet connection throughout your entire house?

Google’s online package of about 40 television channels debuts today in the tech industry’s latest bid to get cable-shunning millennials to pay for television. NEW YORK >> YouTube TV, Google’s new streaming package of about 40 television channels, is the tech industry’s latest bid to get cable-shunning millennials to pay for live TV over the internet. It offers intriguing advantages over rivals, but it remains hobbled by a limited channel selection. Don’t confuse the YouTube service, which debuts Wednesday, with Netflix, Amazon Prime and other streaming offerings. Like similar efforts from Sony, Dish and AT&T’s DirecTV , YouTube TV primarily aims to let you channel surf over the internet, not to stream from an online library of shows and movies. So these internet-cable services can offer live programming, especially sports. But they also come with some serious drawbacks. While these services are typically cheaper than traditional cable or satellite services, people haven’t been signing up in droves. Google is targeting viewers who have never subscribed to cable or satellite TV and are just as happy to get all their video from the internet; getting them to cough up $35 a month could be a hard sell. Google aims to lure subscribers with more sophisticated program search, personalized recommendations and a more fully featured online DVR than rival services offer. But it faces many of the limitations its rivals have. YouTube TV, for instance, features staples such as ESPN and major broadcast networks, but lacks key networks such as PBS, CNN and Comedy Central. And it will initially be only available in a handful of major U.S. cities because media rights are still stuck in the 20th century . ——— WHAT YOU GET … AND WHAT YOU DON’T YouTube TV offers plenty of live sports, one of the chief reasons people stick with cable. Pick a team, and the service automatically records all the televised games it can find. Available channels include ESPN, Big Ten and sports networks from Comcast, Fox and CBS — but not Turner networks such as TBS and others that aired the bulk of March Madness. New York Mets fans won’t get baseball games on SNY. YouTube also has the youth-oriented Freeform and CW networks; its rivals lack The CW. AMC is coming in a few weeks, so you’ll have to wait to catch up on the just-ended season of “The Walking Dead.” Since most channel numbers and names are meaningless in a digital world, YouTube TV arranges live channels by topic, starting with broadcast networks, sports, youth-oriented channels, then everything else. Subscriptions are initially limited to New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia and the San Francisco Bay Area — all locations where YouTube could get rights to local ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC stations. ——— SEARCH PARTY As you’d expect from Google, search is one of YouTube’s big selling points. Its rivals already offer search by shows and sometimes by actors; YouTube adds topical searches, such as “aliens” or “road trips.” Unfortunately, it’s still a work in progress. A search for “nerd comedy” brings up “The Big Bang Theory,” but “comedy about nerds” does not. And a search for “Modern Family episode on basketball” doesn’t bring up the episode titled “Basketball.” YouTube could also stand to take a cue from TiVo recorders and let you automatically record all programs featuring, say, Jennifer Lawrence, including her talk-show appearances. You can search for Jennifer Lawrence, but you need to go through the results and choose shows to record individually — too much work for a service that promises simplicity. One big plus: YouTube’s unlimited DVR will store recordings for nine months, long enough for entire seasons of network shows. Sony’s PlayStation Vue — the only similar service offering an unlimited online DVR — offers only 28 days of storage, nowhere near enough for binge-watching. YouTube TV works on phones, tablets and laptop browsers. Watching on an actual TV requires Google’s Chromecast, an inexpensive streaming stick you control with your phone. (Early subscribers get one for free.) ——— ABOUT YOUR PRIVACY This being Google, your viewing and search histories might be mined for targeted advertising. You can suspend tracking in the settings, though that will hinder personalized recommendations. (It’s too early to tell if that’s a loss or not, though some of the early recommendations have been spot on.) You can share your subscription with five friends or relatives in your household, with three simultaneous streams allowed. No need to share passwords; they sign in with their own Google accounts. Recordings and recommendations are kept separate, so your roommates can’t make fun of you for bingeing “The Real Housewives.” Get the latest news by email Sign Up Share this: PREV NEXT Most Read Report: Aloha Stadium now a ‘liability,’ cheaper to build new stadium Descendants of Sharpes seeking out isle relatives Plea deal expected for dad of ‘Peter Boy’ Barry Manilow says he kept his sexuality secret for ‘fans’ Trump removes Bannon from National Security Council Comments () By participating in online discussions you acknowledge that you have agreed to the TERMS OF SERVICE.

Google Photos details info page shows you the people inside a photo Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/04/05 5:54am PDTApr 5, 2017 35 Plus 1 on G+ 33 Share on Facebook 55 Share on Twitter Total Shares123 Applications Google News Google Photos is really good at recognizing people in a photo and grouping their pics together. It's one feature I've come to rely on to find all the photos I have of specific friends or family members and even photos of "person X and person Y and person Z" together. But there were still a couple of small things missing from Photos' facial recognition like the option to manually tag a person in a pic or the ability to see who Google had recognized in a photo from the photo itself, not their dedicated page. But the latter is now implemented. Actually, it was implemented at some point in the last few versions: I can confirm that it wasn't there in 2.10.0.148909749 but it is live in 2.12.0.151124741, so it was added to Photos sometime between March 13 and 30. Small details aside, this is a simple but nice change. When you tap in the Info icon on any photo while you're browsing your library, you will see a new People section below Description and above Details. In it are thumbnails of all the people Google has recognized in your pics. You can tap the thumbnail to immediately go to that person's dedicated Photos page with all the albums and pictures they're in. Zaher is a very dear friend with an undying love for Android. I'll make him pay for the free publicity. This is a great way to see who Google has tagged in your photos and to jump to individual people's photos without searching for them first. It still doesn't seem to be possible to manually tag someone in your Photos but I'd imagine the function is coming at some point. Google Photos 2.12.0.151124741 has been live on the Play Store for a few days but it's also on APK Mirror if you prefer to grab it there.

Trying to switch to one of these accounts in Google Photos causes the app to crash, and it has been this way since version 2.10.0 Ibrahim Yusuf You're right it crashes on me too makapav I believe, brand accounts/pages were deprecated a long time ago. vwnut13 Creating a new Brand Account is still available on both Google+ and Youtube. Actually, it's not only available, but there is a direct link to create a Brand Account on the Google+ homepage. Suicide_Note Now we just need to be able to manually tag people in a photo. Capt4chris And for search to include shared albums. :-) chris mellor Im on 2.12 and still dont have this feature. johnforamerica Bring back the damn cloud backup icon on individual thumbnails! Since that went away, no way to tell which photos are backed up! (Other than opening each individual photo) Suicide_Note Agreed. It would be nice to have that back. Dennis Ulijn It'll tell you everything's backed up or how many items still need to backed up. I understand not every solution is perfect for everyone, but what would the clutter of a cloud symbol in each photo solve? johnforamerica It would solve exactly what I described. I selectively back up, I don't want everything backed up. With a library of thousands of pictures, you tell me how to figure out which have not yet been backed up... As it functions now, I have NO IDEA what is backed up or not unless I use one of two crappy options: 1) Click on each pic individually to view the cloud icon showing backup status 2) Try to cross reference my device photos with the web version to see "what's missing" It seems pretty clear to me that Google wants to push its users to use the auto backup function, and this is just another step in trying to compel that usage. Dennis Ulijn Okay, fair enough. Thomas Stockx Is this a US only feature? I've been using Google Photo's for ages on my Nexus 6, 6P, and Pixel, but Google is unable to give me search results for any name. Dennis Ulijn Yes. Use a VPN to enable it once, and then it keeps working. You'd have to put in the names yourself though, but after that it keeps adding photos of that person. Florian Reisinger Where to enable it? Dennis Ulijn I think it's the option called 'face grouping'. I use tunnelbear to create a vpn to america. Ailín Ó’S Apparently it's against EU law or something to do that so it's not in Europe. But once you enable it once it works always. rumanuu76 Yep I visited USA, it started working and now always works 😎 towo Still not available in Germany. *sigh* Fruity101079 With a VPN (or chrome extension), fake your location and access google photos , you will be able to enable it. towo Doesn't seem to populate any face matches, though, or does it just take a long time? Jack Smith I need to be able to tag my pets Fruity101079 We still can't change the location of the picture (don't know why, some of them are completely wrong...) thespacecowboy This has been a feature for a long time. Go to Assistant, then Search, then it'll bring a long horizontal list of photos. Click on those, and it will bring all the people it 'knows'. Click on someone it doesn't know and name them, and it'll tag those people in all your photos so you can search them. therealbiglou Yes, we are all aware. This isn't the point of this article.

The Information: Google plans to release a Google Home with mesh networking Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/05 10:03am PDTApr 5, 2017 28 Plus 1 on G+ 25 Share on Facebook 50 Share on Twitter Total Shares103 Google Google Home Google Wifi News Ever since the release of the first Chromecast, Google has been working hard to establish a place in your home. Last year's $129 Google Home was a major release, but it seems like Google isn't stopping there. According to a report from The Information, Google is working on an upgraded version of the Home to compete with the Amazon Echo. From "a person with knowledge of the project," the new product will be a Google Home with built-in Wi-Fi capabilities. Much like the Google WiFi, which was launched around the same time as the Home, it can act as a router and as part of a larger mesh network. This can probably be best described as Google WiFi with Assistant built-in. A person with knowledge of the project told The Information, "They want to have complete coverage of Wi-Fi in the house. Alphabet’s goal is to get more devices in the home that do more. Coverage of Wi-Fi is a huge pain point." I'm a bit skeptical. This new upgraded Home would definitely cost more than the existing model, and support for non-Google networks is unknown. I'm sure the Assistant functionality will work on any Wi-Fi network, but how will it work for networks not using a Google WiFi/new Home as the router? Hopefully we'll find out soon.

Instead of having 4 devices in my house, I could have two - and the cost should scale I'd imagine - maybe $200/device means $400 sunk cost vs. $520. Jimmy Roche So I bought the Google home and the Google onhub, so I'll buy the Google wifi home onhub thing so that I get +3 exp on Google play games when I use my Google pixel on my Google Chromecast over Google fiber FRKSUP #Invested Josh Phillips I have 3 Google Wifi pucks... I also have Google Homes in those same rooms. Makes way too much sense to come from Google, but I very much look forward to this. Chris Sanner I would've looked forward to this *before* I bought two google homes and the three-pack of wifis... OligarchyAmbulance Yeah this seems a bit ridiculous to come out with these after we've all already bought their routers and Home's separately. Morten Ulv I guess people won't need those things in the future. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Now you will be able to put one more google device in the same rooms James Briano Add a proprietary messaging app and I'm sold. Serge Cebrian why only one when they can make several! Suicide_Note Price this one at $129, cut the price of the regular Home to $89. JD No thanks Goog I'll guard my own perimeter thanks. Unless this Router has sticker packs! Ryan oh cool so it's what we all thought the OnHub was supposed to be with its built-in microphone. but now we have to buy both a new mesh system and more homes to replace the old ones. pass. MJ This makes a lot of sense and could save some people a little money. Now, how about a Google WiFi base with a four port switch for people that would like that? Not that it matters to me... I was interested in Google WiFi at one point but decided a router that someone else ultimately controls is just plain stupid. OhYeah! Google doesn't control the google wifi, it's the same as any other mesh network. Also you could just turn off wifi on your current router and hook the google wifi to that to have more lan ports and have googles mesh wifi. MJ Maybe using the word "control" was to strong but you did see this right? https://www.extremetech.com/electronics/245009-google-accidentally-resets-onhub-google-wifi-routers-server-error I don't need any hardware devices (beyond my phone) tried to my Google account. Suppose one doesn't have a working router already or prefers less devices laying around... Defenestratus Don't need it. I have a 3200sqft home and my Netgear R8500 reaches all corners of my home with signal strength enough to stream netflix just fine. I do need about 3 more Google homes though. Since they got it working with the Harmony hub its become even invaluable than just controlling my smartThings hub. Alec M router, modem, tv box, google home combo?? Paulo I wish they would focus on an unobtrusive and inexpensive assistant module with a decent speaker like the echo dot. Put one in every room that doesn't need high fidelity and my smart home is fully voice activated on the cheap. Integrate intercom capabilities and my dream is complete. The echo dots serve my home automation purposes for now but the knowledge graph is really lacking. Let's see if the Nvidia spot ever comes to fruition. Corbin Davenport Yeah, an Echo Dot with Google Assistant would be great. Defenestratus Still waiting on my 2017 SHIELD to get assistant. Corbin Davenport Tablets aren't getting Assistant. Brandon David Obert I think he is taking about the Shield TV kerrhome Add in z-wave and zigbee and we're all set. Corbin Davenport That would be great, actually. So now you just have a mega Google Home to replace your router, SmartThings Hub/other smarthome hub, and speaker. Serge Cebrian #ReplaceAllTheSmartThings!!! Gerardo Sarabia I thought that was the point of all this stuff when they started announcing it. To integrate it into one simple product. But then they made separate products and services that didn't really work together and instead competes with each other. I hope they get it right but seems kind of early for a Google Home upgrade. bekifft No this makes perfect sense based on Google's history. Google doesn't do crazy stuff like "one simple product". They make separate products, that compete. Then they drop support for them and do it all over again. Luxferro I'll never go back to consumer wifi/routers. DistortStatic Meaning? supersanborn Can't wait to see that it's priced greater than the sum of Google WiFi and Google Home. James Sarino I was thinking of getting a second OnHub to increase my range, and a second Home for use at another location in the house. If this revised Google Home/mesh comes out soon, that would be killing two birds with one stone for me! Simon Seems like they are stealing others ideas. This one looks much better. https://youtu.be/pufR8uJAAw0 Frawlz Oh great... now my wifi won't even listen to me. SHunter Cant we just build in Wifi Mesh Router, Smoke Alarm, CO2 detector, and google assistant into ONE device? Then mount it where you would put smoke detectors. (This would be a wired version, not battery) Jose Romero Next year they will unmerge it. JG IMHO, Google should have done this from the start. As I was plotting out how I wanted to set up my house, I noted that I was thinking of putting both a Home and WiFi in the same rooms (the living room and bedroom). These are the two rooms I spend the bulk of my time in when I'm at home. They're going to be where I want to be able to just call out queries to have answered and also where I want to have the best WiFi coverage. Sure, they're snazzy enough they can each be set out in the middle of the room (as opposed to standard "scary alien" looking routers with antennas sticking out of everywhere). But it's still, I only have so much shelf space in each room, and an even more limited number of outlets. Combining a Home and a WiFi into a single unit would save space, there would be less wires to get tangled and one less outlet would be consumed. And while it may cost more than the Home itself, it probably would cost less than a Home and WiFi unit bought separately... lgg4 Makes sense...I've wondered that as looking at our G WiFi and home sitting next to each other in our kitchen 4Ui812 After this is released whats next from Google ? Why it's Google home version 3 which will be released 2 years after version 2. And Google wouldn't be Google if they didn't remove something from that was useful in the previous iteration. Version 3 will lack a voice assistant because ..... Hey it's Google. That's reason enough. bekifft I hope along with this they announce a major upgrade of the existing Home's Assistant functionality. Starting to feel like I wasted my money Nicholas Conrad Don't forget, Home has pogo pins under a sticker on the bottom. Portable battery powered Home with charging base also inbound. Maybe the charging base doubles as the wifi puck. #MakesTOOMuchSense Ordeith All your data are belong to us. -Google Mike I Just a note. This home Assistant is supposed to conjure up the image of a cup of latte.

The companies inked the agreement with Alcatel Submarine Networks (ASN). The partnership builds from existing relations Singtel, Telstra, and SubPartners currently have in place. The new agreement enables the businesses to provide additional connectivity between Australia and South East Asia, with the build of a new international subsea cable system that will connect Singapore, Indonesia and Australia. Once completed, the cable system, previously known as APX West & Central and now named INDIGO, is aimed at strengthening links between Australia and fast-growing South East Asian (SEA) markets. The INDIGO cable system is said to span about 9000km and connect Singapore and Perth, and onwards to Sydney. Within the system, there will be two additional fibre pairs connecting Singapore and Jakarta via a branching unit. The new cable will land in existing facilities in Singapore, Australia, and Indonesia. The two-fibre pair ‘open cable’ design will consist of spectrum sharing technology. Each of the two-fibre pairs used will have a minimum capacity of 18 terabits per second, with the option to increase this capacity in the future. SubPartners CEO, Bevan Slattery, said the delivery of “secure, reliable and high-speed connectivity” between Singapore and Sydney has been the core focus of SubPartners since its inception. "We are delighted to be a part of the INDIGO cable system to finally realise this significant infrastructure project, and provide Australia with a new diverse international route into South East Asia," he mentioned. Back in 2013, Slattery, who was also the NEXTDC founder and non-executive director, announced his intention to retire from the board and focus on his other businesses.

However, my other interests in various other businesses including SubPartners, Megaport and Asia Pacific Data Centre Group (APDC) take up an increasing part of my time,” Slattery said back then. Since the signing of the new agreement, Superloop Limited (ASX: SLC) has acquired all the issued shares of SubPartners. Telstra group managing director of global services and international, David Burns, said with internet data consumption growing by 70 per cent in Asia last year alone, these sorts of investments in international networks are “critical” for meeting the needs of connected consumers and businesses. “This will be an important piece of technology infrastructure connecting South East Asia and Australia, and follows a number of recent network enhancements Telstra has undertaken to meet growing demand for data and better connectivity from our customers across the Asia-Pacific region,” he said.

INDIGO will be a new data superhighway that facilitates Singtel, and our subsidiary Optus, to catalyse the development of digital economies across the regions,” Keat said. ASN will construct the cable, which is expected to be completed by mid-2019.

Skip to navigation Skip to content Skip to sidebar News World More High-end prostitute convicted in death of Google executive may be deported back to Canada Douglas Quan  04.05.2017 Alix Tichelman, left, of Folsom, Calif., speaks with a public defender during her arraignment in Santa Cruz, July 9, 2014. Deceased Google executive Forrest Hayes A photo posted to Twitter of Alix Tichelman. ShareAdjustCommentPrint A high-end call girl convicted in the overdose death of a Google executive is facing possible deportation to her native Canada after being detained by U.S. immigration authorities. Alix Tichelman pleaded guilty two years ago to involuntary manslaughter and administering drugs to Forrest Hayes, 51, who was found dead on his Santa Cruz, Calif., yacht in November 2013 from a heroin overdose. Video surveillance showed that Hayes had slumped over and lost consciousness after Tichelman injected him. But Tichelman did not call for help and instead wiped away evidence, gathered her belongings and left the scene. After serving about half her sentence, Tichelman was released last week by the Santa Cruz County Jail only to be picked up by federal immigration officers. “Ms. Tichelman was taken into custody by deportation officers with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) March 29,” ICE spokesman James Schwab said in a statement Wednesday. “Department of Homeland Security databases indicate Ms. Tichelman has multiple prior criminal convictions, including convictions for involuntary manslaughter and a felony drug charge. She will remain in DHS/ICE custody pending removal proceedings.” The Santa Cruz Sentinel newspaper reported court documents showed Tichelman had dual citizenship in the U.S. and Canada. But local TV station KSBW cited a source who said Tichelman was living in the U.S. on a green card. The station also reported that Tichelman was scheduled to appear before a federal immigration judge in San Francisco on Wednesday, but neither Schwab nor a spokeswoman for the Department of Justice’s Executive Office for Immigration Review was able to provide any updates about her case, citing privacy reasons. An immigration expert told KSBW that Tichelman’s chances of staying in the U.S. did not look good given the seriousness of her crime and the notoriety surrounding it. The tawdry case received widespread media attention. Headlines described Tichelman variously as the “Harbor Hooker” and the “Call Girl Killer.” An in-depth piece by the CBS news program 48 Hours titled “Kiss of Death and the Google Exec” described how Hayes, the father of five, had met Tichelman on a dating website called SeekingArrangement.com. CEO Brandon Wade described the website to 48 Hours as a “Sugar Daddy dating website” that matched wealthy men with women they could “pamper and spoil.” Hayes had hired Tichelman multiple times, it was reported. Their last encounter took place on Hayes’ yacht, called Escape, in the Santa Cruz harbour. “She was so callous that, in gathering her things, she was literally stepping over the body and at one point … to grab a glass of wine and finish the glass of wine,” Santa Cruz police spokesman Steve Clark said in a TV interview in 2015. Hayes was described in his online obituary as a loving father and husband who “more than anything else … enjoyed spending time with his family at home and on his boat.” Several months after Hayes’ death, an undercover detective set up a profile on the same dating website to set up a rendezvous with Tichelman. That’s when she was arrested. Tichelman describes herself on one of her social media accounts as a “makeup artist/model/stylist/hustler/writer/baddestbitch/exotic dancer.” Media reports indicate she grew up in the U.S., but spent part of her early childhood attending a private school in Surrey, B.C. Her parents live in the state of Georgia, but their Facebook profiles show links to the Vancouver area. They could not be reached for comment Wednesday. The lawyers who represented Tichelman in her criminal proceedings did not respond to messages. • Email: dquan@postmedia.com | Twitter: dougquan Comments We encourage all readers to share their views on our articles and blog posts.

Play Store v7.7 prepares to roll out new security features and split notification settings to a separate screen [APK Teardown] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/04/04 5:39pm PDTApr 4, 2017 28 Plus 1 on G+ 135 Share on Facebook 73 Share on Twitter Total Shares236 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Article Contents 1 Teardown 1.1 Warnings about installing unknown and unsafe software 1.2 code 1.3 Increased visibility of the app scanner 1.4 code 1.5 code 1.6 Dedicated settings screen for notifications 1.7 code 2 Download Google is pushing out a new version of the Play Store for Android users around the world. Like most updates to this version, there really aren't any notable changes showing up already, but there are a few interesting things hidden beneath the hood. There are some new features focused on improving security for apps that are updated from unexpected sources and making its security scanner more visible to users. There's also a plan to move notification settings to their own dedicated screen. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. Warnings about installing unknown and unsafe software If you've been watching out for news about Android O, one of our spotlights covered a tweak to the classic Unknown Sources safety measure intended to prevent installation of potentially dangerous apps. It looks like there's also some momentum from the Play Store to also slow down some of the risky behavior. Some new text describes a "speedbump" intended to remind users that the source of an update they're about to install is not known or necessarily trustworthy. This actually makes the distinction between the original installer of an app, let's say the Play Store or Amazon Appstore, and the source of the update, which might be a different app store, sideloading with ADB, or installing an APK with any other app. code <string name="speedbump_settings_label">Protect my updates</string> <string name="speedbump_settings_description">Notify when apps are updated by unknown sources</string> <string name="package_speedbump_banner">Update is from an unverified source.</string> <string name="package_speedbump_dialog_description">You installed this app from %1$s. %2$s is trying to update it. If you install this update, the app or your device might not work properly.</string> <string name="package_speedbump_dialog_detailed_description">Updates that come from unverified sources could cause your device or apps to behave unpredictably. To keep your device stable, install updates from the same app store where you got the app from.</string> <string name="package_speedbump_dont_update_text">DON'T UPDATE</string> <string name="package_speedbump_headsup_action_view_app">VIEW APP</string> <string name="package_speedbump_headsup_description">You'll still get verified updates from %1$s</string> <string name="package_speedbump_headsup_title">Unsafe update blocked</string> <string name="package_speedbump_install_anyway">Install anyway</string> The warning messages feel a little misrepresentative by associating the issue with stability and improper functionality. It should focus on the nuance that switching sources may affect the consistency and timeliness of updates since they may differ from one source to the next. All the same, the wording is sufficiently ominous as to prevent most regular people from pulling the trigger. Increased visibility of the app scanner Back in the Android 4.2 days, Google began rolling out what could be loosely described as a virus scanner as a part of the Play Store, eventually making it a "constantly active." We rarely heard much about it afterward because most of the serious malware was never even allowed to enter the Play Store thanks to Google's Bouncer scanner. Nevertheless, Google continues to improve the scanner, particularly since it's still an important tool to combat malware installed from sources other than trusted app stores. A recent Play Services update already took one step to make the scanner capabilities a bit more visible with a "Verify Apps" screen with a list of recent scans. It appears the Play Store is going to take another step by giving users a viewport of its current status and more information about the results. In short, we'll be able to see if the scanner is running or if it will wait until the next time it's online, and we'll see if there are any issues discovered. It doesn't sound like much, but this really isn't much less detailed than most modern virus scanners. code <string name="verify_app_install_offline">Security scan will run when next online</string> <string name="verify_app_install_scanning">Verify apps is scanning...</string> <string name="verify_app_no_issues_found_banner">No issues were found</string> <string name="myapps_security_scanning">Verify Apps is scanning…</string> <string name="myapps_security_scanning_timed_out">App verification timed out</string> <string name="myapps_security_info_message">Your apps are safe. Last daily scan %1$s. &lt;a href=\"\"&gt;Learn more&lt;/a&gt;</string> <string name="myapps_security_one_pha_title">Harmful app found</string> <string name="myapps_security_one_pha_message">One harmful app found:</string> <string name="myapps_security_one_pha_dismissed_message">Last daily scan %1$s. 1 harmful app found. &lt;a href=\"\"&gt;Learn more&lt;/a&gt;</string> <string name="myapps_security_several_phas_message">%1$d harmful apps found. Last daily scan %2$s. &lt;a href=\"\"&gt;Learn more&lt;/a&gt;</string> <string name="myapps_security_one_pha_removed_message">Last daily scan %1$s. %2$s was removed. &lt;a href=\"\"&gt;Learn more&lt;/a&gt;</string> New layouts: /layout/my_apps_security_action_in_progres.xml /layout/my_apps_security_info.xml /layout/my_apps_security_one_pha_dismissed.xml /layout/my_apps_security_one_pha_removed.xml /layout/my_apps_security_one_pha.xml /layout/my_apps_security_scanning_in_progress.xml /layout/my_apps_security_several_phas.xml <activity android:name="com.google.android.vending.verifier.VerifyInstallSnackbarActivity" android:excludeFromRecents="true" android:launchMode="singleInstance" android:noHistory="true" android:taskAffinity="" android:theme="@style/TransparentSnackBarTheme" /> Frankly, I'm a little skeptical that this is really going to have any impact on security since users still have no way to interact with it or make any changes. If anything, I suspect the real intent is to raise the visibility of the scanner in Android, probably for the purpose of giving peace of mind to people that only read sensationalist FUD in the news and don't know about or understand the details. While exposing the scanner in this way might not be terribly relevant, the red flags it can raise about an app are.

Dedicated settings screen for notifications The Play Store isn't particularly flush with different types of notifications. Off the top of my head, I can only think of three most of us are likely to see: pending updates, updated apps (auto and manual), and if you're pre-registering for unreleased apps and games, you'll also get notifications when those become available. It's a short list, but it seems like Google is going to add a dedicated screen for the toggles to turn them on and off. code <activity android:name="com.google.android.finsky.notificationsettings.NotificationsSettingsActivity" android:configChanges="keyboardHidden|orientation" android:label="@string/settings_notifications_section_header" android:parentActivityName="com.google.android.finsky.activities.SettingsActivity" android:theme="@style/SettingsTheme"> <meta-data android:name="android.support.PARENT_ACTIVITY" android:value="com.google.android.finsky.activities.SettingsActivity" /> </activity> There's not much else in the way of details to give about this one yet, but it seems like this screen would only exist if the developers had plans to add some additional notifications in the future.

Another variant for ATV, and another for Wear. So install away. Guest Is there a reason it has such a low dpi as opposed to nodpi then? Artem Russakovskii I'm not sure why it's done like that. Suicide_Note Oh, that's great to know. Wasn't aware of that until now. Thanks! Trooper311 Same here. I always waited for the correct size to be posted to to install on my device. Trooper311 So we can ignore the dpi shown over at APK Mirror? If so, nice! Computator At least for the play store itself, but not for other apps. Or at least that's how I understood it. Artem Russakovskii For the Play Store, it seems to be the case. Not sure why it's not a nodpi. Jayson Stephenson Hey Cody, anything interesting going on in the latest Google Carrier Services app update? Cody Toombs I was really sick for a couple weeks last month and fell behind.

Was just curious because it seems a lot has changed than the few lines of code it was a few weeks ago. Cody Toombs Well, it's super not exciting.

Suicide_Note It won't, as you are still free to sideload apps. Jacob Ha There is another change, at least for me. In the last version, when I install an app that is free / discount with "end in 5 days" for example, after I install the app, I could still see the note "end in 5 days". But with the new version, after I install the app, the note "end in 5 days" would disappear. Adam Dudash How about the new "uninstall now" notifications for apps it claims are dangerous but aren't. Like Fake GPS GO. Just because Google/Niantic is taking a stand against Mock Locations now, it doesn't mean an app that was installed from the Play Store, then removed because, I'm guessing, people were abusing it for Pokemon GO, doesn't mean it is a dangerous app and should have a constant, unswipable notification that can only be removed by disabling notifications from the Play Store. saf1927 They probably don't have different flags for removed apps from the Play Store, so it probably treats them all the same way. Vincent I still haven't received the new look. Artem Russakovskii Me neither. :( They're really taking their time on that one. biclapudic <-<!-->I am creating $100 to $130 systematically by carrying down facebook. i used to be unemployed a pair of years earlier , but currently I actually have a very extraordinary occupation with that i build my very own specific pay .I am very appreciative to God and my director .If you wish to induce a good quantity of wage per month like ME , you'll check my details by clicking the link below...HERE➤➤➤➤http://gee.su/XvVUk­­­­­--> Suicide_Note I just got it the day before yesterday.

A security researcher has discovered around 40 zero- in Samsung's Tizen operating system. Samsung adopted Tizen – a Linux-based OS developed in partnership with Intel and based on Nokia and Intel's failed MeeGo – to reduce its dependency on Google's Android operating system and is deploying it in TVs, smartphones, watches and other devices. According to Israeli security researcher Amihai Neiderman, head of research at Equus Software in Israel, almost every system app is vulnerable to attack, but in a presentation at Kaspersky's Security Analyst Summit in St. Martin, he said that some of the bugs found in the OS “felt like 2005”. He claimed that Tizen was "maybe the worst code I've ever seen". He tested his findings on a Samsung smart TV as well as two Tizen smartphones, the Samsung Z1 and Z3, which he purchased on eBay. He claimed that all the security holes found were critical and would enable a hacker to control a Samsung device remotely.  He noted the TV implementation of the software was particularly bad. Its TizenStore app (Samsung's version of the App Store), could be hijacked and inject malicious code into a Tizen device, changing parts of the system to gain control of devices. Another issue was the reuse of code from Bada, Tizen's predecessor operating system. But new code also had problems. One function, called “strcpy()”, has a buffer overflow exploit, while another fails to use SSL encryption when transmitting certain data. "They made a lot of wrong assumptions about where they needed encryption," he said. "It's extra work to move between secure connections and unsecure connections."  Tizen is Samsung's attempt to move beyond using Android in its devices, particularly its smartphones, in a bid to have more control over both the hardware and software its sells. Neiderman said that the company should reconsider widespread deployment of the OS until there has been a major overhaul of the code. Samsung has told the press that it is “fully committed” to working with Neiderman to mitigate flaws.

See Offers Business Posted Yesterday at 7:35 PM Updated April 5 increase font size Google’s YouTube TV aims at non-cable millennials While offering advantages over its live television rivals, it’s hobbled by a limited channel selection. By ANICK JESDANUNAssociated Press Share Comment Read Article NEW YORK — YouTube TV, Google’s new streaming package of about 40 television channels, is the tech industry’s latest bid to get cable-shunning millennials to pay for live TV over the internet. It offers intriguing advantages over rivals, but it remains hobbled by a limited channel selection. Don’t confuse the YouTube service, which debuted Wednesday, with Netflix, Amazon Prime and other streaming offerings. Like similar efforts from Sony, Dish and AT&T’s DirecTV, YouTube TV primarily aims to let you channel surf over the internet, not to stream from an online library of shows and movies. So these internet-cable services can offer live programming, especially sports. YouTube CEO Susan Wojicki, speaks during the introduction of YouTube TV at YouTube Space LA in Los Angeles. Google's online package of about 40 television channels debuted on Wednesday, in the tech industry's latest bid to get cable-shunning millennials to pay for television. Reed Saxon/Associated Press Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store → But they also come with some serious drawbacks. While these services are typically cheaper than traditional cable or satellite services, people haven’t been signing up in droves. Google is targeting viewers who have never subscribed to cable or satellite TV and are just as happy to get all their video from the internet, Getting them to cough up $35 a month could be a hard sell. Google aims to lure subscribers with more sophisticated program search, personalized recommendations and a more fully featured online DVR than rival services offer. But it faces many of the limitations its rivals have. YouTube TV, for instance, features staples such as ESPN and major broadcast networks, but lacks key networks such as PBS, CNN and Comedy Central. And it will initially be only available in a handful of major U.S. cities because media rights are still stuck in the 20th century. WHAT YOU GET YouTube TV offers plenty of live sports, one of the chief reasons people stick with cable. Pick a team, and the service automatically records all the televised games it can find. Available channels include ESPN, Big Ten and sports networks from Comcast, Fox and CBS — but not Turner networks such as TBS and others that aired the bulk of March Madness. New York Mets fans won’t get baseball games on SNY. YouTube also has the youth-oriented Freeform and CW networks; its rivals lack The CW. AMC is coming in a few weeks, so you’ll have to wait to catch up on the just-ended season of “The Walking Dead.” Since most channel numbers and names are meaningless in a digital world, YouTube TV arranges live channels by topic, starting with broadcast networks, sports, youth-oriented channels, then everything else. Subscriptions are initially limited to New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia and the San Francisco Bay Area — all locations where YouTube could get rights to local ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC stations. SEARCH PARTY As you’d expect from Google, search is one of YouTube’s big selling points. Its rivals already offer search by shows and sometimes by actors; YouTube adds topical searches, such as “aliens” or “road trips.” Unfortunately, it’s still a work in progress. A search for “nerd comedy” brings up “The Big Bang Theory,” but “comedy about nerds” does not. And a search for “Modern Family episode on basketball” doesn’t bring up the episode titled “Basketball.” YouTube could also stand to take a cue from TiVo recorders and let you automatically record all programs featuring, say, Jennifer Lawrence, including her talk-show appearances. You can search for Jennifer Lawrence, but you need to go through the results and choose shows to record individually — too much work for a service that promises simplicity. One big plus: YouTube’s unlimited DVR will store recordings for nine months, long enough for entire seasons of network shows. Sony’s PlayStation Vue — the only similar service offering an unlimited online DVR — offers only 28 days of storage, nowhere near enough for binge-watching. YouTube TV works on phones, tablets and laptop browsers. Watching on an actual TV requires Google’s Chromecast, an inexpensive streaming stick you control with your phone. (Early subscribers get one for free.) ABOUT YOUR PRIVACY This being Google, your viewing and search histories might be mined for targeted advertising. You can suspend tracking in the settings, though that will hinder personalized recommendations. (It’s too early to tell if that’s a loss or not, though some of the early recommendations have been spot on.) You can share your subscription with five friends or relatives in your household, with three simultaneous streams allowed. No need to share passwords; they sign in with their own Google accounts. Recordings and recommendations are kept separate, so your roommates can’t make fun of you for bingeing “The Real Housewives.” Share Read or Post Comments Were you interviewed for this story?

This is a question Google has been apparently asking itself, especially since the market is currently exploding with Alexa-powered devices from not only Amazon but just about every other third-party manufacturer out there. And, according to The Information, which talked with an unnamed source, Google has come up with a possible solution: turn Google Home into a mesh Wi-Fi router. In other words, it wants to take Google Wifi and chuck it inside of Google Home, allowing the speaker to not only to play music and answer your questions like normal but also connect to devices around your household and boost coverage in weak spots, such as the basement. The source specifically claimed that the next Google Home model may feature a built-in Wi-Fi with mesh networking. What is Google Wifi and how does the mesh router work? What is Google Home, how does it work, and when can you buy it? The source also mentioned that the original version of Google Wifi - Google's existing Wi-Fi system with mesh networking - had a microphone and a speaker so that it could double as a Google Home or at least offer Home-like interactions, but the company ultimately nixed that prototype because it didn't want to confuse consumers. Now, however, it's considering that again as a way to one-up Amazon Echo. There's no word on a launch date or pricing, but we imagine the company will want to stay between the $120 cost of Google Home and the $180 cost of the full-sized Amazon Echo. However, one Google Wifi unit costs $129, so the combined price of Google Home and Google Wifi is about $250, which may be a little too high-end for people looking to equip their homes with smart speakers.

Regardless of the politics behind it, the GFW is a nuisance for Western brands trying to access China as many of the sites which are used in the West are unavailable in the country.  These include core internet services such as Facebook, Google, Twitter, Snapchat and YouTube as well as many Western publishers. Recently, however, there have been a number of news stories about the GFW, some positive and others decidedly negative. Twitter is one of the blocked sites  The good Loosening up of the GFW being discussed Starting with the good news, Voice of America recently reported that a 'ranking member of China’s top political advisory body' has proposed that China adopt a more open approach toward internet censorship.  The member, Luo Fuhe, indicated that China has gotten to the point where it can begin to cut back on censorship and blocking of non-sensitive content. Luo's main point was that blocking all of the major Western websites and apps is heavy-handed and ends up making life difficult for those, like scientists, who are not interested in sensitive content.  Instead, he suggested, China should come up with a specific 'negative list' of sensitive sites and stick to blocking those. While there was no reporting on the likelihood of the measure being passed, Luo's proposal is one of the first instances of open dissent against the existing GFW policy. Google will re-enter China in 2017 One company which has been affected significantly by the GFW is Google. Google left China in 2010 after it experienced an attack on its infrastructure, purportedly by the Chinese authorities in an attempt to access the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists. While after the event Google kept a presence in Hong Kong  (which operates under different laws from the mainland), the Google sites and services were withdrawn from China and they remain inaccessible through the GFW. Recent reports, however, indicate that Google may be re-entering China, slowly. The Washington Post reported in March that the Google Translate app is now available in the country for the first time in seven years. Discussions are also in place to re-launch Google Scholar in the country as well. Additionally, The Information recently reported that NetEase Inc., China's second-largest online games provider, will form a joint venture with Google to launch the Google Play service in the country. While neither of these announcements indicate that sites which matter to brands (i.e. Google search and YouTube) will ever be available in the country again, these moves are at least a start in the right direction. The bad Pinterest is now blocked Just as things seemed to be going in the right direction, CNNMoney reported in March that Pinterest, previously available in the China, is now blocked by the GFW along with most other Western social media sites. No specific reason was given for blocking Pinterest, but many speculated that the site was banned in order to ensure that similar, local internet services could be developed without foreign competition. While it's not certain which sites would take its place for the Chinese consumer, XiaoHongShu is a contender.  The app allows Chinese consumers to review merchandise bought overseas and start discussions with other brand fans in China. NYT reports on harassment in China The New York Times (NYT) website has a long history in China which started after a ban on the site was dropped in 2001. Since a crackdown in 2012, though, the main NYT site has been blocked by the GFW and the company's local office has faced a continuous stream of harassment in the country, chronicled in a recent article. According to the report, surveillance equipment has been installed on their communications lines, their landlord has been asked not to renew a lease, and their Chinese employees are occasionally questioned by state agents. Also, Apple has removed NYT's app from the Chinese app store, likely due to Chinese government pressure. Chinese VPN users now face fines While the concept of a national firewall seems quite heavy-handed to Westerners, there was a sense that people in China who wanted to get around the GFW could do so without too much effort. Chinese netizens can, for a small fee, subscribe illicitly to a foreign-based Virtual Private Network (VPN) which allows them free and full access to the Western internet.  And while it seemed that doing so was viewed as mischievous, it wasn't widely regarded as criminal.  That seems to have changed.  Recently, China has introduced a fine for VPN users of up to 15,000 yuan or approximately three months of the average salary in the country. So is more openness on the horizon? It doesn't look likely, sadly.  In addition to reporting on the proposal about loosening the GFW site restrictions, Voice of America noted that: ...as news of the proposal began to spread in China, the country’s internet minders moved in to tamp down any discussion, blocking access to the proposal and stories about its content online. It seems that the Chinese will be using a walled garden version of the internet for some time to come.

Twitter Facebook Google is helping to build another Asia-Pacific submarine cable The new undersea fiber-optic cable will Australia, Singapore and Indonesia Blair Hanley Frank (IDG News Service) 06 April, 2017 09:34 - - - - print email Comments Google is investing in another massive undersea fiber-optic cable as a part of its plans to build out network connectivity around the world. The company announced Wednesday that it is helping to fund a project called Indigo, which will connect Jakarta, Singapore, Perth and Sydney to one another. The cable will run for approximately 9,000 kilometers (almost 5,600 miles) and provide a capacity of roughly 18Tbps (bits per second). It's being built to bring users more connectivity in a region that has growing internet needs. Google has now invested in five submarine cables in the Asia-Pacific region and seven overall. By investing in these cables, the company hopes to better compete with other cloud providers and consumer internet companies. Alcatel Submarine Networks will build the cable, and Google expects it to be finished by the middle of 2019. Other Indigo investors include cable company SubPartners and ISPs AARNet, Indosat Ooredoo, Singtel and Telstra. Only Google and the other investors will be able to use Indigo, though Singtel and Telstra will be able to sell capacity to their customers as part of their telecom businesses.Â  Google and other users of the cable will be able to expand its capacity with future technology to keep up with growing needs. Indigo has two fiber pairs, one-third as many as the trans-Pacific FASTER cable turned on last year, where Google was also an investor. Interestingly, Indigoâs roughly 9,000-kilometer run puts it on par with the length of FASTER. It's that long partly because of the curving path it needs to take to connect the four cities along its length. Join the Computerworld New Zealand newsletter!

Some Nexus 6Ps have developed a battery early shutoff problem, and it's becoming a safety issue David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2016/12/20 11:10am PDTDec 20, 2016 211 Plus 1 on G+ 366 Share on Facebook 174 Share on Twitter Total Shares751 News Nexus 6P A number of Nexus 6P owners have reported an alarming battery problem with their phones as of Android 7.0 being released for the handset, which causes the phone to power down when the battery gauge still shows anywhere from 10 to 60% battery remaining. How widespread the issue is at this point isn't clear, but the main thread on the Google issue tracker has 229 stars. There are also a significant number of threads describing the problem on Google's Product Forums (see: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). Owners have linked it to Android 7.0, but even those who have attempted flashing back to Marshmallow report the problem still occurs, though generally at lower indicated remaining battery percentages than on Nougat. This suggests some kind of change in Android 7.0 that is exacerbating what would appear to be an underlying hardware problem. There are some reports that 6P owners with the issue who have their batteries replaced see the problem largely alleviated, again pointing to what seems fundamentally a hardware failure that has been made worse by software. While Google has assigned the issue in its tracker, it's been given a low priority and there has been no indication of an incoming fix. Those who have attempted to receive warranty service from Huawei have been rebuffed, with the OEM telling them the problem is not with the phone or the battery, but with Google's changes to the software. Interestingly, it seems the problem is most common in very cold climates. These are where we see reports of phones dying at upwards of 60% battery remaining indicated, which is obviously completely ridiculous. As some on the various threads point out, this could easily be a major safety issue. We have become deeply reliant on our smartphones to help us get around - be it hail an Uber, navigate us to our destination with a map, or simply to call or text a person to let them know where or when we'll be. Such functions have become so critical that suddenly having your phone die unexpectedly could actually place you in danger. Imagine if you were in an unfamiliar place (one without frequent taxis), late at night, trying to hail an Uber in exceptionally cold weather, and then your phone kicked the bucket. What would you do? This actually happened to one poster on reddit, who was fortunate enough to find a hotel where he or she was able to use a phone to call a friend (whose phone number they knew - how many people know each other's phone numbers these days?) to pick them up. What if your car broke down on a freezing night and you were unable to phone a tow company? Our world and infrastructure, and our very decision-making processes as humans, have started to evolve around the ubiquity of constant connection through our smartphones. Without them, we can be left feeling helpless. We'll be reaching out to Google about this to see if they have any comment.

It does work sometimes. maverick7526 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/31ff0858463dce3005d122af1771be1674201f869957270e6de3b939a5bd5adf.png Happens to me Everytime I finish a run using mapmyfitness now. This morning my battery was a lil under 50%, and I go to save my workout, and it just flashes the battery saver screen and shuts down. The only way to get it to boot is to plug it in. It did this one other time when I was playing around with Google maps battery was around 40%. Hopefully Google can figure this crap out. jfbaudio I called Google while I was still under the 1 year warranty, they replaced it for me. The problem was creeping up, from shutdowns at 4%, then 7%, and so on to 20% when I had it replaced. It took about 2 months to get there. This was during the summer so cold weather didn't play into it. Scott Harris Haven't had this problem but last week I had problems with my phone freezing on me. Was forced to have to do the power + volume down button to turn it off. Left the Android beta and didn't restore any backups. Did that like 2 days ago and so far no freezes. Have already been considering switching to iPhone, but if this battery thing starts happening to my 6P then I'm done with Android. Matías Duarte 1-Get a Note 7 2-Wait until explodes 3-Warm your N6P with the Note flames 4-??? 5-Profit. melvin My dies at 15%. When I reboot. It's back 30%. Like wth. I assumed battery was shot. Rawhi Mohammad Sounds more and more like the iPhone.. this new Pixel strategy is getting crazier by the day. just_a_regular_citizen I have the problem with my 6P. It's been worse outside in the cold. I took a screenshot right after I plugged in and restarted. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5edefbc6313ef36d560ab07169dc6fa529e1d969dd6d2f0c6c2b43f8a7df673d.png ChuckDz3 This hit me very close to home! I was involved in a car accident over the weekend due to the icy road conditions in the midwest. In the middle of calling 911 for help my phone died. My battery was at 60% before I dialed the call. It was 8 degrees outside and almost stranded with no help. Luckily I was only 5 minutes away from my place and was able to walk home. This could have ended very different due to this issue! Robert A Lyon I have the issue, BUT it didn't originally begin at 7.0. Everything was okay until a couple weeks after the push out of 7.0, my whole phone went dark, no charge, wouldn't turn on, it was just a brick. It had restarted 3 times in a row, on the third restart just wouldn't do anything. Tried all the fixes recommended online. Sent back to Huwaii and on receipt back the phone turns on but the battery drain is present. Colder weather is worse and the battery goes dead anywhere from about 20% to 15% left to zero in a matter of a second or two. Battery saver mode comes on at 15% and it'll die on me. No problem before sending it in for the other power issue. Also get it back and the camera no longer focuses in close up. So in other words, I had no problem at the initial release of 7.0, it wasn't until the OEM got it and screwed it up. Adam C Just my speculation but I do not think any battery does well with rapid charging over the long term. I never charge my 6p with rapid charging and I still have great battery life on 7.0. for over a year. I wonder how may folks that have this issue uses rapid vs standard charging. Kid.Drunkadelic I kinda of feel bad to the guy I sold mine too then, I sold cause I thought Google was back to their old shit if not quality checking and dog flooding their code enough and my battery sucked. Sucked so bad I got a 6s plus now I see how much of dramatic change in battery life I now have. I might never come back Ernie So, is it hardware or software. Sounds like a hardware problem of sorts!!! Chris B Been having this issue for around a month as well. Shutoff is usually around 10-35% and seems worse in cool weather. onekage This happened to me today! Phone was left in cold car for few hours(16°F) , unlocked the device. Battery read 58% suddenly it powered off and would not come back on. Brought inside and put on charger 61% battery. This in not acceptable. I live in a freezing cold climate 7-8 months out of the year. I'm on 7.1.1. If this continues I'll be selling the phone or getting a replacement. Dakota Rickel So should I ask Google for a replacement or wait for more news about what the exact issue is and how they plan to fix it? MisterJ Sure the battery problem is an issue, but does it pose a material danger? I don't think so. Humans have lived without phones for millennia. If you are so dependent on your phone that you think you're gonna die without it, you need to rethink your life, and come up with different contingency plans that don't require a phone. With that said, i own a nexus 6p, and i have seen phone die at around 10 to 15%, but a few nights ago, i was able push the battery all the way down to 1%. Maybe being on the Android beta program has something to do with it? va_d1m How about this situation: - stayed out really late, about ~8.5km from the home for the first time in few years. - battery died at 25%, unable to get Uber (which has been our main form of cab service for a number of years for multiple reasons). - no cabs would take me home because "it's too short a fare during shift change-over time" which is illegal but happens all the time (Melbournians would understand), - walked home Sure, I did not feel in any danger and I know my city well but since we have become so reliant on our phones (and phone companies are complicit in commoditising smart phone ownership), when they break it causes severe inconvenience to our lives. Extrapolate that to being a tourist in a foreign country the outcome can be more than just inconvenient.. MisterJ Just think about what your parents' generation would have done. It's that simple. Brett Sewell I just went through three weeks of -20 weather with the update no issues but I certainly wouldn't trust my life to my phone either in a snowstorm Tom Z I had mine shut down at 38% once. Most of the time it's around 25% when it shuts down. It doesn't even get a chance to go into battery saver. I hope Google fixes this soon. Kyle Salewski Has been happening to me a TON in the past 2-3 weeks! I thought it was just me with a faulty battery. I do see it in very cold temps, it's been negative degrees or single digits here in Milwaukee quite a few days in the past few weeks.seems to be anything under 30 or 25% and then POOF!, dead. About a week ago I was getting an Uber and shut off after I requested it. Luckily I remembered the make and license of the car picking me up downtown. I would have been stuck out in the freezing snow without a phone. It happened Sunday night and again Monday night of this week. I did run the 7.1.1 update AFTER I charged it back up last night after it died. Hopefully this update changed something, but I'm not holding my breath. KingOfRedLions7 So this is common? Mine started doing this recently at around 25% and aside from that it also drained probably around twice as fast as it should have. Then I got a new battery replacement and the day after it died around 80% but I recalibrated the battery and it's been working good as new since then. If it really is the software accelerating hardware failure than I'm going to be pissed if it starts having problems again. :/ Cory Wilson Reading this on my 6p. Haven't noticed an issue yet and hopefully I won't. But I also thought I was immune to the g4 bootloop of death problem and then it happened and it sucked. psychomaniac189 did anybody email huawei and get a response? what was the response? mine was, Thank you for contacting Huawei Device USA. We're so sorry to hear about the battery issues you've been experiencing with your Nexus. Please guide to the following troubleshooting steps to attempt to correct the charging issue. If the steps are successful but you are still experiencing battery drainage, please contact us at 1-888-548-2934. 1. Plug your charger into the wall before plugging it into your phone. 2. Hold down the power button. 3. Without letting go of the power button, plug your phone into the charger. 4. Continue to hold the power button for another 20 seconds. The phone should begin to charge normally. Noam I have this issue too. I live in Israel, haven't noticed any connection to temperature. I hope they fix this, it's driving me mad! Wilson X Nearly 40% have this issue, voted by Chinese N6P users. https://plus.google.com/u/0/+WilsonX/posts/eS6ANzEMprR wadea This problem started very soon after I updated to 7.0. It also coincided with a trip I took to South Korea; the first time I ever traveled to a non-english country. My phone died without warning at 15% one night during my trip, and although I had a reasonable amount of information written down, I still ended up stranded due to the inability to access my phone, and being in a 'suburban' area of Seoul with very few services. So yah, it can be a safety issue. I'm aware of the problem now, so when I leave again for Korea in a month, for a year this time, I'm resolving the issue by replacing my phone. I can't be in a foreign country, and have an unreliable phone in my pocket. Morten Ulv I thought that it was related to me using the 60w chromebook pixel charger for the phone. Never died above like 12% and it has been a while since I had the problem. But possibly because I charge it in time... Fartknocker Had the problem once when I took the phone out of my pocket and put it in my center console while I was driving home. It was in the single digits that night. When I got it indoors, it worked fine again and the true, original battery amount came back. Gavin Dunsire I seem to be having this issue with my Pixel (not XL model). Dorothygroybal Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Apparently, Huawei and Google just want to blame each other, while we users have to deal with the problem. Eoghan Murphy I'm seeing similar behaviour on my Moto G4 plus, and its not cold in Brisbane. Phone just shuts off randomly and when powered back on battery life is significantly reduced. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/706643efc8f98525f285b681ac3481677d6ca2c38c7c8b1620e5ca2f8e44e624.png Marc Westermann Seeing exactly the same issues since 7.0 on my Nexus 6P. The device shuts off when it hits the 15% threshold for the batterysaver. I contacted google multiple times for an RMA but they keep saying it's apps and that I should factory reset and not use apps for several days to confirm the issue. Eventually I got someone to send me the RMA link as I saw that they would charge you the full price of the nexus 6P if the returned device would be considered "flawless" in the eyes of the google support. I talked it through with the gouvernment customer care center here in germany and they said that this is unacceptable but there is nothing I can do at the moment. Worst service experience ever. Check out the screenshots, it's fun! /s https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/da1b67aa1745daaa6c04379733cecb5d1423f4555bae8ddeaf1f9d66fa67b404.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/54e3430ee46793e40bc03539c9c2f72e32df6893bb5f5a742d95ff4ad887b533.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5f87b86e96716feb8fd4b94d202750630c0ddf98f297f357f9a095af4b962113.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/6f6295d0e83ce0143d97df04c8bfdfc328bd9be95086bb09851f2385781f6a4d.jpg Stefano Miranda Hi. I am also here in Germany, but I have the big problem that my German is not really that good, so I was not able to find any Huawei customer center neither am I able to talk to the customer support in German. What makes it even more complicated is that I bought it on Amazon France, and I don't speak french either so I cannot complain with them. Please, if you have any information that may be relevant, send me a comment down below. I am even willing to pay for a new battery, this problem is really frustrating. Marc Westermann Wow, that's quiet a situation you got yourself into. As far as I can tell, there are Huawei shops in many major cities in Germany. There is also a support hotline from which I would assume that they talk at least basic english. But I think your best chance would be to contact Amazon in your origin country. I could imagine that they could help you as well. If not, I'd try Amazon France in english. Stefano Miranda I live in Munich but I did not see any Huawei shop here. do they also offer customer service in the shops? do you have a list? If I google for that I just find the Design Center here in Munich and not the Handy's shop LOL Marc Westermann Just search for them on google maps. I don't know if they offer customer service, but I'd assume that. It's pretty standard in germany for shops to also offer assistance on products. mchalakov What would you do? Hmmm I don't know .. WALK! Like all the 'poor' humans do where there is no Uber. And just change the battery... Josh They will never admit anything. They literally kept making us wait with ridiculous request after ridiculous request until finally the warranty expired for issues we had with bend gate and the glass popping out randomly with normal use. Google has purposely scammed a lot of people with this phone. Never will I ever purchase another Nexus or pixel product. Brian Michael Last week I gave up my Nexus 6p after battery drain issues and also when I upgraded to Nougat 7.1 my 6p kept bootlooping. So, I just bought a OnePlus 3T to hold me over. I am very pleased. I'll definitely think twice before buying another Google phone. Matt I am having issues with the battery, drops fast. And turns off randomly below 14% I did contact google, my device is less than 6 months old. They are replacing it for free. Aniket Vasishth I am glad that AP wrote an article on this.. at least now it will be taken seriously by Google Cenzo Great. The way this author writes, it won't be long before smartphones will be declared a necessity. paulmike3 For you, it might never be. For others, it is. Don't judge what you don't understand completely. Cenzo You obviously don't understand what basic human necessities are. paulmike3 I do. If we were talking about basic human necessities, I would agree with you. We're not. You said "necessity", which is a different classification. A car, a phone, electricity, heat, etc. are all necessities in my life (home, work). Without them, I would be in a critical safety situation, given the 12F temperature outside right now. The article remains spot on. Cenzo Corrected for context. Latheryin If you think it is then you have bigger issues then battery problems. There is nothing to understand. Might want to check anyone that thinks it is as they have some very big mental issues. Jonas Andersson Mine dies every night at about 15%. I have battery saver at 15% but the screen turns orange and about the same times it dies. Victory Hand I used to have this issue but 7.1.1 seems to have fixed it. Laird Rixford Mine always happens after using the camera. Even at 25%+. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/bbea09d0194204d95339235943431ae6a221f8a4e195dc3a98d6a53a024fc310.png w https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8db3f5c513a96eafe8f20c1d778f421d2f4a7f072c60c59f588f59959ac515cd.png Russell I've had the same issue after updating my Pixel XL to 7.1.1. I contacted Google support and they said other users are experiencing the same issue. Hopefully a fix comes soon because my phone shuts off sometimes with just less than 50%!! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/343c7bd4c50adb1781ede1d1bd3de748fb0b529b5ed87694d38ed96d8216c77f.png paulmike3 This is good info, thanks! If you haven't already, please post this on the Android bug report thread as well (and state that it's happening on your Pixel XL) -> https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=227849 Michael Hall This is a big fat joke. It is crap like this which makes the iPhone look more and more tempting. If I'm anywhere near 20% then open up a high drain app like Snapchat, it just dies. I love Google, but Christ they are useless. Andre Natale David, please stay on top of this. I thought I was alone In this issue but I am glad you made light of it. dblock The behavior of this is very strange, as it happens to me, but usually never above 30% battery remaining. It only happens to me when I use something that seems to be resource-intensive. I noticed that it mainly happens when I use my camera while the battery is below 30%, or something that utilizes the camera, like Snapchat. Otherwise it seems like I can drain my battery down to 0 if I don't use my camera. I have never seen it randomly shut off while using anything else, that I can recall anyhow. Still, I assume something like Uber might also cause this behavior, especially when you are awaiting a ride to show up and the ride tracker map is up, as that is probably somewhat resource-heavy. Either way, it is unacceptable. For me, this started happening as soon as I started using Nougat in general, not 7.1.1 specifically. Initially I thought it was just a result of custom ROMs, however now that Nougat is more widely available, it looks like that is not the case at all. Chris Babes This has really been effecting me greatly! Please fix. I'm at the point where I may have to get a new phone. I work outdoors in Ontario, Canada. So frustrating and dangerous. Robert Andersson Buy a Huawei. melvin my just did it at 37%.. so frustration. Alex O’Brien Same thing happens to me although I live in a warm climate (California) and, to the best of my recollection, has only happened once my battery is around 15%. It is definitely a safety issue. sodsavage Having this same issue, didn't know it was a widespread problem. Believe it or not, I was actually assaulted because of this issue affected a situation. RVCA It sounds like only a small amount of people are impacted. Haha Suckers!! Arman G This has actually happened to me recently. It was like -10C, phone had a 50% charge left and died on me, just as my Uber driver went past me. So I missed the Uber and the ability to get to my destination in time. I had to rely on m my work iPhone the rest of the night. See the screenshot of the battery meter. No explanation for the sharp power dip. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/cf7a5e1479a23d65e57b6cd424f788820e14c622977f8b62b35cbeaecce7211a.png Ger PG I live in the not-so-cold weathers of Mediterranean Europe but yesterday I spent a whole day in Prague at -5 ºC and my phone kept dying at 35%. Later at night I saw this article in Android Police describing this issue and I felt like you were explaining my day. I spent 550€ on this phone 6 months ago, so they'd better be fixing this soon. By the way, I am still running Android 6.0.1, so add this build to the list of affected ones. jobber99 this happened to me starting in september, i was on 7.0 i believe--would get to 15% and then down to 0. i called google store support, and they replaced my 6p. it is now also happening to my wife's phone, on 7.1.1, but it's too late i think for her to call google store support as the phone is > 1 year old now Kelly This happens to me. The first time I was out of town (and the phone was a month old) so it was extra scary. I didn't know this is what was happening but now that you describe it, it fits. I pull my phone out of my purse and it won't cut on. I have to plug it in and wait for at least 30 seconds before the power button will turn it back on. It does not show the battery charging icon either, so it looks bricked. Scary!!! It's happened twice. I also notice it shutting down and/or restarting itself all the time but I think that's the stupid button sensitivity. Kelly Oh and this was way before 7.0 (it was August this year) and was indoors in a moderate climate. staticx57 I've had mine shut down numerous times at around 30% and this was on MM Chris This actually just happened to me. I was inside, sitting at 60% battery, when my phone just powers off with the low battery warning. Thinking it was just a normal crash, I reboot it and went to to plug it on the charger anyway, it fully booted (off the charger) but then showed 2% battery remaining. I looked at the battery history, it has been running for 3 hours and was somewhere around 60-65% when it literally dropped to zero. And I hadn't barely used my phone except at the very start of the day. Didn't realize it was a widespread issue, also only happened once. ( My phone usually powers off at about 10% normally, I just assumed that was within the margin of error for battery prediction) Patrick Murphy Yep mine has been doing it since it got cold in upstate New York usually 30% or lower plus since Android 7.0 dropped seemed worse Fernando Pena Never happened to me after a full year of use... Martial Clausse Was waiting the train on the platform, in the cold, phone shut down at 30%. Tried turning it on again, as soon as boot animation finished it shut down again. Once in the train, I charged it a little, and it booted up with 29% battery. Kashif Sheikh After the most recent update, my Nexus 5x went into an unfixable bootloop, which apparently is a very common issue. Not sure if this is some joint hardware/software issue, but it seems to have been triggered after a software update: http://www.techtimes.com/articles/186940/20161125/lg-cant-fix-nexus-5x-bootloop-issue-so-its-offering-full-refunds.htm MarkM Thank you for reporting on this. My 6P shut down in 20 degree temps with 55% battery left while hiking in the wilderness. I was not able to restart until it was plugged into a charger. This is definitely a safety issue that Google needs to address as soon as possible. MarkM check it out: https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/1ebf53c40e7e86db227443e8b655467e6a662ebae3bc6fdd181894458458ed3c.jpg Luxferro Hopefully you posted this on the Google issue tracker as well. Scott Kennedy Hah. I literally just had Google agree to an out-of-warranty replacement for this issue. I was expecting them to say no (I just needed documentation they wouldn't cover it), but the replacement arrived today. It'll make a nice gift for someone. Mine happened around 35%, indoors. Nothing to do with cold weather. Xu Mengran i am glad that people are paying attention to this. It has been keeping happening to me. the phone usually shuts off around 25% and needs to be connected to the socket otherwise cannot be turned on!!!! tibor ric Same on my Nexus 6p. Battery is dropping mast faster than when the phone was new... 3223 So much for fast updates while being half baked. Maybe oem's holding off updating their phones to rectify internal coding errors seems like a much better option than getting the fastest updates first and having these things happen.. Luke I usually don't comment, but articles like these are very important. So many issues that only occur after a certain time (especially once you're out of warranty) get swept under the rug and companies don't pay the price for making devices that don't last. I also find it worrying after reading some of the comments here, people with this issue actually consider solving the problem by buying a Pixel. Seriously guys, vote with your dollars and don't empower companies that treat you like shit. Let's hope Google can fix this. Luxferro Can we get this pinned at the top of the site until Google fixes it? If this gets no more press Google will take their sweet time fixing it, if at all. Rob Paek My 6P hasn't been shutting down but I feel like since the second to last update (I'm in the beta program) my battery life on standby is abysmal. Plus the emojis I send don't show up in the Messenger texting app (Google's, not Facebook). Brownstar No issues with mine tibor ric Living in Sweden. It was only 5°C outside... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8a00b2758b995826cf17b5f6a2c2eaee41230b56d9d301402f3ceba8f67f6c7e.png Matt Virus My 6p on marshmallow does this all the time...Sometimes at 20 or 25%....But yesterday I was doing outside work in the cold and my phone died at over 50%. Insp_Gadget Happens to me, regardless of the temperature. Happened this morning at 45% and I was indoors (hadn't been outside) for over 12 hours. imdevu Started happening on my 6P from yesterday. And suddenly it is a nightmare. Especially since 6P is my primary device (and the only one I carry) Robert Andersson Google is implementing the iPhone feature where batteries die at 30 %. Ricardo Torres My nexus 6p recently started showing this problem. Jon E. This happened to me last week while driving in my cold car during below-freezing temperatures outside. It was connected to the USB-C car charger and running Google Maps Navigation. It had around 50% battery and it randomly shut itself off, did not come back on by itself. I had to dangerously pull over while the sleet/ice was getting worse with the freezing wind, and when I turned it back on, it came on and then immediately turned itself off again. I literally SAT on my damn phone for 7-10 mins until it warmed up, then it booted up okay, but it showed 13% battery for some reason...I've been worried about it, and now here I am seeing this is a widespread issue; wonderful. Shay Carmel The issue is not because of cold environment. I live in Israel where it's 23 degrees or more and it happend to me as well, battery drain and shuts down at 16 percent. Ceridwen I've had it happen with up to 38% battery life remaining on mine. Seems to occur most often when the phone is even marginally cold (30 degree weather, phone in coat pocket) and I activate the camera. Made my husband quite angry with me once for not telling him my phone was low before it died while I was at the park with our daughter. Rather frustrated at this point because I've already RMA'd the phone twice for rebooting issues where it would refuse to turn back on for hours at a time. Not impressed with quality control for this device. Diwa Galvez Does the issue persists in 7.1.1? Mine is still on Marshmallow, and I've been holding out on the upgrade. weictay My 6P was just upgraded to 7.1.1 a few days ago and yesterday, I noticed my phone had shut down at 25% battery life. Never had this happened before while it was 7.0 so this was a surprise. Stephen Cornwell Happened to me today: https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e10378fd3532e7e6b183e2085e162a4bf1f2e8b7307c1854d33caf1a2dcb1faa.png Left on the side of the road in -2°C because my phone died and I couldn't call to be picked up. Running 7.1.1 so it's obviously not fixed yet. Gerardo Sarabia I broke my pixel so while fixing it decided to use my Nexus 6p. Is dying at about 33%. Ridiculous. Any news on this? Trevor I was at 75% and this just happened as I was playing with my dog outside (I live in Canada so it is cold) and the phone just dies! I just got the phone 4 months ago too. Andrey I have the same problem. Was snowboarding at Stevens Pass in WA and just ten minutes after I hit the slopes the phone died at 40% battery. The temperature outside was 15F. Basically phone renders useless in mellow cold weather. Any updates on the fix? EastOakland510 Same thing is happening to my phone too usually after 20% Alexander Gontar Any feedback from Google or Huawei on this article? Tom Frascone (theorie) Just recently developed this problem on my Nexus 6P purchased in Jan 2016. Currently running 7.1.1 and when my battery hits 20% it divebombs to around 10% before automatically shutting off. It's winter, but I live in Florida and it's been around 70F the past month...so not sure temp is an issue. Just called Google and they said my phone is still in warranty (by only a few days) and they are going to replace it. eastprecinctguy That just happened to me tonight. Out of the country, late at night, trying to get back to the hotel, cold out - phone dies with plenty of battery life. Won't turn back on. Thank God I brought my portable charger. Not good. TrOpAzR So I just spent the last 40 minutes with Google Chat Support regarding this issue. I was the owner of a launch device and had zero issues with this phone until 7.1.1. 3-4 weeks ago my phone started shutting off between 5-10% battery. I took multiple screenshots and submitted them to Google Support. They pointed me to a list of 30 different things that I should do for "optimal" use but eventually RMA'd the device after the problem persisted even after a full wipe and reflash of the latest system images. I received my replacement device today and let it hang out on 7.0 which is what it shipped with. Battery acted completely normal and the phone was behaving really well. Had a persistent notification to upgrade to 7.1.1 and reluctantly accepted. Phone lasted about 15 minutes off the charger before it died near 25-30% battery. Attached is the screenshot. This is absolutely unacceptable. I have since been back in contact with Google Chat Support and they've promised to escalate this to a "specialist". Before I RMA'd my original device I asked them if this would continue to be a problem. They assured me that the refurbished replacement would be "tested to the highest standards" and that I would have nothing to worry about. Literally less than 3 hours after receiving the replacement device the problem is even worse than it was with my original device. Since it was on 7.0 when I received it they obviously didn't even test the replacement with the 7.1.1 update to ensure there were no issues with the software.. Simple deduction leads me to believe that this is absolutely a problem with 7.1.1. The 7.1.1 software update is obviously borking SOMETHING on this device. In addition, my old device suffered from the "echo" problem on phone calls for multiple months. However, I refused to believe there was an issue and would always tell the other person it was THEIR phone. Found out real quick that I was incorrect when I saw the thread about this issue here on XDA.. Sure, the phones aren't exploding like the Note 7.....but Google has a serious issue on their hands that they must address quickly. Unfortunately, I don't think they will. We must demand that this problem is fixed....and fixed soon. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/25eca7a15aad8a3b2a76adcefdd9d963140ea4355aa44d05663207124c0ac04e.png Ray My phone used to die around 5% when I used to take walks in the park. I thought it might have just been an issue with the phone not having enough energy to handle the gps, so I ignored it. Yesterday I was waiting for an Uber and I saw my driver go past me on the map. He called me, and right after I tried to speak the phone shut off completely. I had about 34% battery but couldn't turn the phone back on. I'm lucky he didn't just give up and go home or it would have been a major inconvenience. I owned two Nexus 6 phones and both had a similar issue as well. With the 6 there was some over heating that I think caused the issue, but back when I had a Galaxy S3 I had bad overheating and the battery never behaved like that. I feel like since they introduced all of this rapid charging technology these smartphone batteries are starting to fail quicker. Shaik Shahir I don't have the battery issue most of the time , but I think it's related to cold , becuz whenever I keep my AC on it gets damn cold inside the room and at that time my phone shuts down but when it's not cold it works perfectly . Israel Rodriguez I just went from loving my Nexus the first year after release and as soon as that update rolled out I just have grown to hate my phone I once loved. Such a shame Google is hiding from this waiting for things to blow over. I wish they do a recall or something to get it fixed otherwise this is the worst investment I've ever made Stephen Metz-Lago Same thing. Take a picture or video in cold weather and game over, even with over 50% charge. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/c8faa6cbe1d087a3b07ba213803feed31f0f32c80e9e7220d48ad30a8b5ea1ef.png Ching-Wang Hung Thanks for reporting this but were you able to get comments from Google on this issue yet? Huawei customer support keeps saying it's a software issue and refused to provide any repairs or replacements even though my phone is still within warranty. I'm really disappointed in them and will never buy their products again. Richard Y I would always tell everyone the biggest draw of this phone is now for once, I never had to think about battery life, ever. How fast things change. Those who feel it's Nougat or the weather are mistaken. These problems started occuring when the Pixel was released - Google made sure the Nexus 6P had problems a) to get nexus owners to jump ship go Pixel and b) any bad publicity on the Nexus would ensure there would be no debate as to whether someone had to decide between the 6P and a Pixel. Weh Yeoh This issue is online in a few blogs, it's also on Google's issue tracker but as a low priority, (https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=227849) which is poor form. It doesn't seem like Huawei are taking it seriously either. This issue has been unresolved for me since October. I think it's time to step it up so I've just purchased two domains, googledoesntlisten.com and huaweidoesntlisten.com. One might be able to redirect to the other. My idea is that we can post screenshots of our battery issues, our locations, and maybe a one sentence line like "I was stuck in the snow when my phone's GPS shut down" to hammer home the reality of the issue here. This might get Google and Huawei to do something, especially since it's affecting a lot of people. Problem is, I'm very poor on website design. Now that i have purchased the domains, who is willing to help me get them set up? roseskegg It happens to me all the time, and I live in the Bay Area! It's never below 45 degrees, but my phone just shut off today at 40% Tomasimpo I have been suffering from early battery shutoffs for the past month or so. Finally having had enough of waiting for Google to release a software fix for this issue I called the UK Google support and CSR immediately said it was an known issue affecting a very small number of handsets. I asked for a new handset and they said yes immediately. I now have a brand new 6p on 7.1.1 without the issue. My handset was purchased at launch from the Google Store so was over 12 months old so was expecting a fight for a new handset. Anyone in the UK who got their handset direct from Google I suggest you phone them and get yourselves an shiny new 6p. TBolt My Nexus 6P died the other day at around 20% battery life (I'm in warm Orange County, California). I started googling the issue to see if there have been any known fixes for the problem -- sadly nothing from Google or Huawei. Very disappointing for Google Android & Huawei. Justin Alick Have had this problem since December 2016, with shutdowns (and inability to restart until charging) guaranteed between 15-20% and once at 50%. This has been hugely disruptive to my professional and personal life - I recently swapped from Samsung to Google's native phones and will move on if the company doesn't fix this problem soon. Akabari I know this old but I wanted to point out this happens to me a lot, and I once had to walk 4 miles in below zero temps and stay at a hotel because of it Ricardo N Feliciano It may not be effective, but I've made a Change.org petition for this issue (and the bootloop issue as well): https://www.change.org/p/google-support-acknowledge-nexus-6p-issues Phillip Mwaniki I bought a nexus 6p a month ago and it still has this issue. Can't trust google anymore. Qadir Ali khan problem not with the device problem is with android N factory image. even I am also facing this problem when first I upgrade to android N 7.0 and problem is continues until I decide to step to custom rom . now I am on Pure Nexus rom android 7.1.1 and phone performance is awesome with a great battery life without any issue . Ricardo N Feliciano I made a petition for this problem: https://www.change.org/p/google-support-acknowledge-nexus-6p-issues Margaritas Ante Porcos This happened to my 6p now after 7.1.2 update. I am beyond furious with Google. ←  Older Comments  → Follow Android Police 1.5M 464k 141k 104k Latest Deals 21 [Deal Alert] Grab these free and 10-cent apps, games, and icon packs 2017/04/05 6:44am PDTApr 5, 2017 20 [Deal Alert] The Moto G4 Plus is $189.99 ($60 off) on Amazon 2017/04/04 2:26pm PDTApr 4, 2017 15 [Deal Alert] Amazon is discounting unlocked phones from Sony, LeEco, Lenovo, and more by up to $125 2017/04/04 12:33pm PDTApr 4, 2017 0 [Deal Alert] Amazon has a 2-node Netgear Orbi Home WiFi system and an Echo Dot bundle for $330 ($91 off) 2017/04/04 12:00pm PDTApr 4, 2017 15 [Deal Alert] Save $5.50 on a dual-coil fast charging wireless stand from CHOETECH with our exclusive coupon code ($16.50 after coupon) 2017/04/04 10:38am PDTApr 4, 2017 Latest Poll How often do you use virtual reality products (that you own)?

In fact, YouTuber MKBHD actually requested such a feature in his latest video rant, in which he goes onto provide Samsung with a little advice on duplicating already great Google apps and services on all of their devices. Turns out, the Galaxy S8’s extra hardware button can be used to launch another app, you’ll just need to download a 3rd party app to do it. To prove it, someone posted a video straight from a Best Buy Galaxy S8 demo unit showing the newly remapped Bixby button launching Google Now. The app that enables this is called “All in one Gestures” and after enabling accessibility services, the app will have full permission to remap any of the physical buttons on your Android — including those the Galaxy S8’s physical Bixby button. There was little doubt that even if Samsung didn’t enable this sort of functionality out of the box, Android’s 3rd party developers would find a way. The best part is now you wont have to wait for someone to build something — it’s already in the Play Store right now. You can download All in one Gestures for free via the link below.

The company announced Wednesday that it is helping to fund a project called Indigo, which will connect Jakarta, Singapore, Perth and Sydney to one another. The cable will run for approximately 9,000 kilometers (almost 5,600 miles) and provide a capacity of roughly 18Tbps (bits per second). It's being built to bring users more connectivity in a region that has growing internet needs. Google has now invested in five submarine cables in the Asia-Pacific region and seven overall. By investing in these cables, the company hopes to better compete with other cloud providers and consumer internet companies. Alcatel Submarine Networks will build the cable, and Google expects it to be finished by the middle of 2019. Other Indigo investors include cable company SubPartners and ISPs AARNet, Indosat Ooredoo, Singtel and Telstra. Only Google and the other investors will be able to use Indigo, though Singtel and Telstra will be able to sell capacity to their customers as part of their telecom businesses.  Google and other users of the cable will be able to expand its capacity with future technology to keep up with growing needs. Indigo has two fiber pairs, one-third as many as the trans-Pacific FASTER cable turned on last year, where Google was also an investor. Interestingly, Indigo’s roughly 9,000-kilometer run puts it on par with the length of FASTER. It's that long partly because of the curving path it needs to take to connect the four cities along its length.

By Stephanie Condon for Between the Lines | April 5, 2017 -- 23:15 GMT (16:15 PDT) | Topic: Networking Google announced Wednesday that it's investing in a new subsea cable system that will run between Australia and Asia. The investment is Google's latest move to strengthen its ties to the APAC region. Called Indigo, the cable will connect Perth, Sydney and Singapore, with a branch to Jakarta. To build the cable, Google is partnering with AARNet, Indosat Ooredoo, Singtel, SubPartners and Telstra, while Alcatel Submarine Networks will construct the cable. Span approximately 9,000 kilometers, it's expected to be completed by mid-2019. Indigo will initially have two fiber pairs with a design capacity of around 18 terabits per second -- enough capacity for people in Singapore and Sydney to join 8 million simultaneous high-definition Google Hangout video conference calls. Indigo is the latest effort to build out subsea cable capacity across the Asia-Pacific region, as data usage grows there. Google has already invested in four other submarine cables in the region, including the FASTER and PLCN cables. Google considers its network infrastructure a key part of its pitch to potential Google Cloud Platform (GCP) customers, boasting the largest network backbone of any public cloud provider. In November, GCP opened its Tokyo region, and it has plans to open regions in Singapore and Sydney this year.

An Israeli security researcher takes a good look at Samsung's Tizen, labels it the worst code he has ever seen Jordan Palmer Follow View All Posts 2017/04/04 11:26am PDTApr 4, 2017 64 Plus 1 on G+ 276 Share on Facebook 74 Share on Twitter Total Shares414 News Samsung Android is a hulking beast as far as global user share is concerned — hell, it's the most-used operating system in the world, surpassing even Windows (in terms of internet usage). When Samsung announced that it was creating its own open-source alternative to Google's mobile OS, it was not really a surprise. We've had several upstarts over the years, like Sailfish, Firefox OS, Ubuntu Touch, and so on, but all of them have failed in some form or another. There were a few people, however, who thought Sammy could be the one to unseat Google and Android with a mobile operating system that it called Tizen. Whether it's pronounced TEE-zen or TIE-zen is still a mystery (Wikipedia and I say it's the latter), but up until now, word on the integrity and security of the code has been relatively scant. Israeli researcher Amihai Neiderman finally dove into Tizen's guts to see what he could find. According to his report to Motherboard, what he found wasn't good. Niederman claims that the operating system contains what "may be the worst code [he's] ever seen" with signs of amateur mistakes/practices and no less than 40 zero-day vulnerabilities. All of those 40 allow for remote-code execution, which permits nefarious parties to access and assume varying levels of control of a Tizen device. Remember, there are quite a few devices running Samsung's OS, including the Gear smartwatches and some phones. One of the most critical vulnerabilities was in the Tizen Store (the equivalent of the Play Store or App Store), which allowed Niederman to inject malicious code into his Samsung TV (also running Tizen). His conclusion from this was that you as a hypothetical third-party could "update a Tizen system with any malicious code you want." Even the store's authentication measures weren't enough — he just used a heap-overflow vulnerability (which he also discovered) to hijack the software before the security protocols activated. Moving on, Niederman says that Tizen's code base is quite outdated and even borrows some elements from Bada, its predecessor. However, he claims that most of the issues he found were in the new code, which was written in the last two years or so. Some of the mistakes are those one might find programmers making twenty years ago. As Motherboard puts it, this shows that Sammy lacks any basic code development or review practices. To prove his point, Niederman points to one example that he claims was everywhere in Tizen, strcpy(). Basically, strcpy() is a flawed function that is easily exploitable and is not used anymore because of that, yet it is supposedly prevalent in Tizen. To top everything off, Niederman says that the programmers failed to use SSL encryption in certain areas during specific data transmissions. This led him to conclude that they made the wrong assumptions on what needed to be encrypted and purposefully left out SSL in those places. When he initially reached out to Samsung to declare his findings, he was greeted with an automated response. Motherboard's attempts to contact the Korean conglomerate resulted only in the basic PR drivel about the company's focus on security and whatnot. However, after the original article got published, Sammy reached out again to Motherboard to claim that it was working with Niederman to resolve the issues, who corroborated this by saying he was in talks with the corporation. You can read more at the source link below if you're interested. Honestly, I can't say that I'm too surprised. As Mr. Niederman puts it, Samsung should reconsider deploying Tizen to its appliances and future phones before doing a serious overhaul on the code. I find that I agree with him.

(Sarcasm) JohnyNoLegs Lazy coding by coders....SHOCKER!!!! (Sarcasm because even google/apple has shitty code haha) F4LL0U7 But by all means, let's spend $900 on the new Galaxy phone, because I'm sure it's both immune to their terrible code, and totally worth the price tag. Ome Dries The S8 doesn't use Tizen though, so your phone should be safe... your Samsung powered fridge is a different story Leonardo Baez Or their line of smartwatch John Doe Yeah but they probably use the same programmers for Tizen and Android. kalehv I wouldn't think so. Tizen and Android are very very different inside out. demarcmj Probably not the same programmers, but the culture, processes, etc. are probably the same. Just this. the general attitude can't (and won't) be different MJ No... The Android and Tizen programmers are most certainly on different teams and only deal with their platform. This does not mean Samsung as a whole is good at software. John Doe We don't know if they really are on different teams unless Samsung told you. MJ I wouldn't know if Samsung employs cows for programmers unless they told me but I can almost guarantee the teams are separate. Programming teams at any company tend to specialize on ONE project at a time. It's not the same guys... There will be a small number of top programmers who will move from team to to team to fix problems or help with deadlines. John Doe "I can almost guarantee the teams are separate" No you can't unless you are an employee there and know what Samsung is doing. Samsung is not your typical silicon valley tech company so I have no idea how they work. MJ It's funny your whole argument is there is no way we can know how they do it at Samsung yet you had no problem making the statement the Android and Tizen programmers are probably the same which would be a totally unusual setup for any company with large programmer teams. Why not just go with they are probably cows which is why their software is so bad. LOL John Doe They probably are cows :) F4LL0U7 Right, but my point is that their code is crap, and they're making tons of "enhancements" to the Android OS, plus the dozens of Google apps they unnecessarily duplicate. Their terrible code makes a huge impact on the Android ecosystem. tim242 They don't unnecessarily duplicate anything. Samsung has many apps that are far superior to Google's bloatware. John Doe https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e46717cc007988df31954f458f30b8b237b2c4e803101752d08debfaa155bcf3.gif tim242 Samsung Pay>Android Pay Samsung Browser>Chrome John Doe Samsung pay is greater how exactly? And no on the browser I used Samsung's browser it is not as good as chrome. tim242 Ummm I can use Samsung Pay everywhere. As for the browser, you are full of shit. John Doe Umm that is hardware not software, Samsung bought looppay to do that and it has nothing to do with Samsung's software. Chrome is the most used browser in the world...facts. tim242 It is hardware and software, you know like Android Pay uses NFC. You aren't very smart. As for the browser, since when does most used equal best? McDonald's burgers are the most popular burgers, but nobody will claim them to be the best. Do better. John Doe Wow lmao. Looppay uses MST like your credit card so very little software is needed for it to work. You just need to store credit card information. with NFC there is more communications on both ends and more authentication is required. It is more secure than Magnetic strips. But at the end of the day when it comes to software Apple pay and Android Pay are much better (Design, speed, ease of use, etc) I have used Samsung's browser it is featureless. Chrome has a lot of features that I use and it is fast. I save my passwords in chrome, I have data saver, Read later, cached pages for quick reload, Google AMP, autofill is synced, better privacy controls and Do Not Track, Google translate embedded, and fine grain controls for sites accessing camera, microphone, notifications, etc. Samsung's browser is small potatoes compared to Chrome. AbbyZFresh If you've used Samsung's browser, then you would know it's speed >>>>> Chrome is well worth less features in the way John Doe Bitch please you are a bigger troll than Tim and you are a Google hater. Why are you even here? tim242 Your ignorance/stupidity is really showing. MST uses tokenization just the same as NFC. You should educate yourself before commenting about something you know nothing about. Samsung Pay is superior, deal with it. Samsung's browser is lighter, and has more features. You can log into sites with your fingerprint. Try that in Chrome. You can also use an ad blocker plugin. Try that in Chrome. Oh, and it is Chromium based. That means it has a lot of Chrome features as well. Do better John Doe What does tokenization have to do with using the app? We are comparing Samsung Pay with Android pay here and you said samsung pay is better because you can use it anywhere that has nothing to do with samsung pay dumbass that is looppay which samsung bought. It has nothing to do with the actual software. When it comes to the actual app the design, speed and ease of use of Android and Apple pay is better than samsung pay. Chrome still has a lot more features that the two you mentioned. But I can't change the mind of an ignorant troll. A troll is a troll is a troll. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/70cffa9c6cf517883f23a7ea527e30ffa7ecb7b3f6c82e8599d47b0b1cca584e.gif tim242 LoopPay does not exist. Samsung bought it and incorporated it into Samsung Pay, which makes it better than Android Pay. Tokenization means it is not insecure, as you claimed. You are the obvious troll. You make no sense at all. John Doe Looppay is a hardware feature it has very little to do with the app that is like saying I can use 3.5mm headphones with my music app compared to the iPhone. It is a hardware feature but the app at the end of the day is judged separate from that. You are truly fucken moron and deserve a note 7. tim242 LoopPay was the name of a company that no longer exists. MST was bought by Samsung and is part of Samsung Pay. Hardware can't work without software. Why you are trying to separate the two, is beyond me. Take the tech that Google bought from SoftCard/ISIS out of Android Pay, and see how far that NFC chip gets you. You are now on block, as your stupidity is too much for me. John Doe Samsung bought looppay and its patents so you can't have MST on other devices. We are comparing Samsung with Google here so you have to compare only the software not the harware (This whole fucken article is about software and samsung's incompetence). You are fucken retarted Softcard/ISIS was bought for Google wallet not Android pay and it was because carriers blocked Google wallet so Google bought softcard which was made by the carriers. Samsung pay sucks, period. "Samsung Pay's security measures are based on Samsung Knox and ARM TrustZone technologies; credit card information is stored in a secure token.[3] Payments must be authenticated using a fingerprint scan.[6][7] In August 2016, security researcher Salvador Mendoza disclosed a potential flaw with Samsung Pay, arguing that its security tokens were not sufficiently randomized and could become predictable. He also designed a handheld device that could be used to skim magnetic secure transmission tokens, and another which could spoof magnetic stripes on actual card readers using the token. Samsung responded to the report, stating that "If at any time there is a potential vulnerability, we will act promptly to investigate and resolve the issue".[8]" http://www.zdnet.com/article/flaw-in-samsung-pay-lets-hackers-wirelessly-skim-credit-cards/ Middlefinger Just because people are forced to use chrome on Android it doesnt mean its the best. Its the new IE, its terrible on mobile and hardly better on desktop. MJ Who are these people who are forced to use Chrome on Android? John Doe They are not forced to use it. Chrome doesn't come preloaded on desktop but it is still the number one because people go and download it. And it doesn't come preloaded on all Android phones. Middlefinger Yes, it is on every Android phone. If people chose Chrome over Firefox then thats their own problem and its not like FF is perfect either. John Doe It is not on every Android phone. And they choose it because they like it and want to use it. Middlefinger Its compulsory according to the Android licensing agreement, if you want Google play access. John Doe The play store is not on every Android phone...its not on any phone in china for example and the Mobile Application Distribution Agreement is optional and Google chrome is not even set to default and is hidden in a folder on Samsung devices so no one is forcing anyone to do anything here. Middlefinger Its on every phone that has access to the play store. What china does is not relevant to this so dont deflect. You know full well what i was referring to, not that it will stop you claiming victory as is usual on here. Its not hidden, its right on the damn home screen on international unlocked OEM devices. John Doe You said "*EVERY* android phone has Google Chrome". There are plenty of Android phones that do not sign that agreement and do not have the play store on them also the agreement is negotiated with Google including what apps to include. This agreement is also signed with carriers so Google, OEMs and the carriers negotiate it. And yes it is hidden in the US carrier version because I had to go through the app list, open the folder, click on it to use it and also have to make it default...it is not set to default. This was on an S7 edge. https://landing.google.com/intl/en/androidisforusers/faq.html https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-4a46Ko8RE Middlefinger Newsflash, the world doesnt revolve around US carriers.. On the first point.. well done, you won on a technicality that neither of us were even talking about anyway. John Doe That is where OEMs sell the majority of their phones through carriers and specifically US carriers not international unlocked phones which samsung doesn't even update on time (But that is another issue). But even in the international unlocked phone I am sure the S7 also does not have chrome as the default browser. Middlefinger My Samsung devices do, as did my LGs, HTCs and so on (including network branded ones). Some US carriers may have other things installed and set to default, but its the exception in the world. Either way Google requires its bloat be installed, and i dont see that as any better than Samsungs. John Doe You may think is bloat but the billions of Google users out there do not think so go download what you like. Shame-sung C.E.O Swinesung Pay is Garbage. Don't fall for this guys Sheep Mentallity. This is the same person who said CURRENT-C was going to be the winner out of Payment wars LOL!! No joke he was the biggest shill for Months. Shame-sung C.E.O https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d20aef0fbc504aadabb8bd8fde48166d56c8b76806fd4b9f3e699fb0f3c88c9a.jpg https://media.giphy.com/media/l3E6uhDAN3W7vylji/giphy.gif LMFAO!!! LineOS for exynos! I know Samsung browser is based on chromium... But he say 'better' becouse ad blocker... If chrome have ad blocker is will be faster.. that for sure Suicide_Note Two hardly qualifies as 'many apps'. tim242 That was just two examples. Another example is Messages. I have to use Samsung Messages, because Google forces pop up messages, unless you silence them altogether. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages all the time, but I'm not aware of any pop-up messages. Or are you referring to the way the message notification pops up? tim242 Yes, the notifications. Google took the option out of the settings to disable that nonsense. Samsung put the option into their app. Why is Google forcing that on us? It is annoying to have them interrupt what I am doing, and disregards privacy Suicide_Note I like it since i can see if i need to reply immediately or not, or just dismiss it to the notification tray, but to each their own. Good thing we have so many options to choose from. 😊 tim242 Yeah, I would use Google Messenger, if only I could disable that. Knowing Google, they may add that back later. JohnyNoLegs Google doesn't even have an audio recording app LOL. Google has barely anything. Literally BARE Middlefinger amung browser is superior to chrome. A carrier Pigeon is better than chrome, at least Samsung internet actually exits properly when you press the back button. John Doe So go use a carrier pigeon...troll LoL If you like Samsung and their programming skills go buy a Tizen phone Middlefinger I prefer Samsung to Google anyway. Android is a damn mess and getting worse again. Sure 7 is better than the total disaster that was kitkat, but its worse than anything since KK. John Doe Ok so go get a Tizen phone http://www.samsung.com/in/smartphones/samsung-z3/ Middlefinger I prefer Samsungs mods to Android to Googles 'stock', Samsung actually seem to test it before breaking everyone devices. John Doe That is because everyone's device is already broken (Laggy, buggy, slow, and filled with unnecessary apps). Middlefinger Like most of the Google apps, yeah you're right. John Doe Google's apps are updated continually and are stable than the majority of OEM apps since they are mostly updated by OTA instead of through the play store like all of Google's apps. Anyways, that doesn't change the fact that Samsung's software is laggy and terrible...it also gets worse over time which is just sad. And the fact that they take forever to update their phones does not help your argument. Middlefinger Firstly thats horseshit, Google apps are just as unstable as any. Secondly Samsungs launcher can be laggy, jsut like Googles can be painfully limited, so dont use either. The rest of the Samsung mods are better than Googles, especially the notification pulldown. Ive already addressed the update thing. If Google was pushing 7.1.1 to every device in the world there would be hundreds of millions that randomly rebooted. The OEMs test better and it takes time. Older thats stable and fixed is better than newer and broken. John Doe Firstly thats horseshit, Google apps are just as unstable as any. I use Google's apps daily and they are not unstable actually they are highly rated in the play store compared to samsung's apps and are used by way more people that just shows how stable they are. Unless you are using beta version, heck even the beta version is stable so I have no idea what you are talking about. There are always problems with updates even Apple has them with iOS but the difference is Google can push out a fix quickly like Apple. Also with new updates you get security patches and fixes for older bugs that take months to fix when going through OEMs and carriers. If you think Samsung's programming is good go check the article you are commenting on LoL. Middlefinger So what if google can and does patch things quickly, it shouldn't get broken in the first place. This just doesn't happen with most OEM devices, and hasnt to a single one ive ever had. My Nexus devices have been a string of bad hardware, poor software, show stopping faults and RMAs. John Doe I have had several nexus devices and pixel and I have never had severe problems to a point where I had to send it in. There are bugs like any other OEM especially samsung but Google has the ability to fix them quickly. Newflash, it does happen with a lot of OEMs including Apple. This isn't new anyways Google's software is highly praised on the pixel compared to Samsung's "horseshit". Go check the reviews. Middlefinger Im sure the 9 people that have a Pixel just loved the reboots. Nice its fixed, shame it ever happened. Never had severe problem eh? Ive never had ANY with anything except the Nexus'. Highly praised is it? By who exactly? If its the same people that bought the Nexus then they are easily pleased and highly biased. You cant deny there is an entire body of fanboys out there that love AOSP, regardless of how bad it is. If google just secretly used all Samsungs code for 8 it would be the best thing ever, because bias blinds. John Doe 9 people? classy. Nice joke. Never had severe problem eh? Ive never had ANY with anything except the Nexus'. You just lost all credibility just stop. All the tech blogs gave it excellent reviews and said it was the best Android phone available even tech blogs that favor Apple said so and that says a lot. Middlefinger Yeah, OK. Zero Mizukami What didnt you like about kitkat? I was always under the impression kitkat was more or less the pinnacle of Android Audio Totally disagree. There are no Samsung apps on my S7 that I actually use. tim242 That's you. I use Samsung Pay every day, to pay for everything. Samsung's browser is far superior to Chrome. I use Samsung's SMS app, because Google forces pop up messages on theirs. F4LL0U7 That's your opinion, and of course I have my own. It was just a little frustrating when I started my work GS7 for the first time and saw two of nearly every app. As a Nexus/Pixel guy, I'm horrified at Samsung's terrible (in my opinion) design and functionality standards. Not to mention the 3rd party garbage they toss in there too. I had to purchase an app that allows me to disable their default apps. When your first task in the process of setting up a new phone is to wade through and remove the bloat, there's something wrong there. tim242 I purchased a package disabler as well. But I also had to disable a lot of Google bloatware as well. John Doe You need to look up the term bloatware. Lookup, Microsoft office, facebook, and all the other unnecessary apps that don't need to be preinstalled are bloatware. Anyways I don't know what I am arguing with you samsung phones are burning up...literally so unless samsung sells 100+ million s8 they will always be behind apple. tim242 Behind apple haha you are silly. John Doe Why is that silly? They are behind Apple in the smartphone business. tim242 That is not true. Get educated, then comment. John Doe Lmao http://www.techtimes.com/articles/188124/20161208/apple-iphone-7-is-the-best-selling-smartphone-in-us-trumping-the-samsung-galaxy-s7-kantar.htm https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/56f89a4335e2c7fe807cdebf208e142c62b61a5cec127b30c1f4b3c96aee3961.gif tim242 Lmao that is just the S7.

There's tons of Google bloatware I delete every time I get a new device with Android on it. Granted, I think Samsung and Google should get a pass for including their software because it's Samsung's hardware and part Samsung and part Google's software. Completely 3rd party companies like carriers or Microsoft stuffing their software is the worst kind of bloatware. John Doe Google apps are not bloatware because people do use them and they are useful. Bloatware means apps that people don't use and waste space on your device. Google's apps definitly do not waste space and the majority of them are used so no they are not bloatware. These are the apps Google requires most are Google play apps: Google Chrome Google Maps Google Drive YouTube Gmail Google+ (The only one I think is unnecessary) Google Play Music Google Play Movies Google Play Books Google Play Newsstand Google Play Games Google Photos Hangouts (Probably stopped requiring it already) byteseyes Your conclusion that Google apps are not bloatware rests on the premise that people use them. By the same token, Samsung apps are not bloatware because people do use them and they are useful. Realistically, I can count on 2 hands the number of people I've come across who use Google Play Music, Movies, Books, Newsstand, Games, Photos, Hangouts, and Google+. Most people I know do use YouTube and Maps the most, while Chrome is forced onto people often. Drive is a wash. That means almost all of Google's apps are not commonly used, hence waste space. So don't you think it's unfair and untrue to make the assumption that people use Google apps, while simultaneously making the unfair and untrue assumption that people don't use Samsung apps? I personally love Samsung apps and I find most of Google's apps redundant. I can understand if people are vice versa. Haha, sorry, I didn't mean this response to be too long, so all boiled down, Samsung and Google apps are either both bloatware or both not. Hope you can understand that they can not be different. John Doe Fact is that far more people use Google's apps than Samsung's you can check the play store reviews and how many people use them. Google's services are used way more often than Samsung's that is a known fact. Google and Samsung do not release numbers of every single app but Google has a billion+ monthly active users on some of their services. When it comes to the Google play apps, they come in a package with the play store. It makes no fucken sense to have a music section in the play store and no app to play it with. They are a package. Chrome is not "forced" on people. You need to lookup what that word means and Chrome is not even set as default on samsung devices so how the hell is it "forced"? That means almost all of Google's apps are not commonly used, hence waste space. It is silly to make a statement like that So don't you think it's unfair and untrue to make the assumption that people use Google apps, while simultaneously making the unfair and untrue assumption that people don't use Samsung apps? No because like stated above Google has more than billion+ active users on their services and highly rated apps in the play store and they a regularly updated. Samsung on the other hand has even discontinued multiple apps and services because no one is using them like Samsung milk music. https://play.google.com/store/apps/collection/search_results_cluster_apps?clp=ggEJCgdzYW1zdW5n:S:ANO1ljLMiXA https://play.google.com/store/apps/collection/search_results_cluster_apps?clp=ggEICgZnb29nbGU%3D:S:ANO1ljIY5oM Bloatware apps are determined by the user and I am positive that more users find Google's apps in a favorable light than Samsung's. You are in the minority. byteseyes "Fact is that far more people use Google's apps than Samsung's you can check the play store reviews and how many people use them. Google's services are used way more often than Samsung's that is a known fact. Google and Samsung do not release numbers of every single app but Google has a billion+ monthly active users on some of their services." YouTube and Maps are the most popular. The majority of Google apps are not used at all by most people. But that doesn't matter. The point is lots of people use Google apps, and lots of people use Samsung apps too. You can't ignore one group of people even if it's one order of magnitude smaller. It's still a significant number. "When it comes to the Google play apps, they come in a package with the play store. It makes no fucken sense to have a music section in the play store and no app to play it with. They are a package." Many people don't use them. I'm just using your own assumption and logic. I personally deleted them. Whether it makes sense or not to include them is irrelevant. Of course from a company's perspective it almost always makes sense to include their own service. That's business. You're inclined to make justifications for Google but not for others. "Chrome is not "forced" on people. You need to lookup what that word means and Chrome is not even set as default on samsung devices so how the hell is it "forced"?" It's not forced on Samsung devices thank god. But anyway, instead of on smartphones, I was just remembering off the top of my head about the Chrome browser slipping its way into many people's computers, so I was going off a tangent there. "It is silly to make a statement like that" It's pure logic. "No because like stated above Google has more than billion+ active users on their services and highly rated apps in the play store and they a regularly updated. Samsung on the other hand has even discontinued multiple apps and services because no one is using them like Samsung milk music." Again, that's not the case for almost all of Google's apps. Most of Google's apps are not commonly used. Google also discontinues or leaves as zombies apps that no one uses. "Bloatware apps are determined by the user" That's what I've been saying all along. "and I am positive that more users find Google's apps in a favorable light than Samsung's. You are in the minority." Of course a software-centric company is going to have a larger user base. I may be in the minority, but it's still a large number of people. We're not talking about 1 user vs 1 million. If there's 1 user, and an app is installed to cater to that one 1 user, then it would be bad to include the app. But many, many, many people use Samsung apps too. You can't cherry pick what you like and ignore everything that others like. John Doe Exactly so going back to my original comment that Google's apps are not bloatware and that apps from Facebook, Microsoft, and Lookout are bloatware. Also when Samsung has two music apps like Google play music and Milk on their devices and they end up discontinuing Milk because no one uses it that is also bloatware. So I am glad we cleared up your confusion on whether Google's apps are "definitly bloatware" https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/04d006e4bd2b9525b0b0e9550444617ee69614c33bf605ad372243dc9af02410.png byteseyes Logic must not be your strong suit. John Doe Good Job nice comeback byteseyes Thanks. byteseyes I can understand your viewpoint. Me personally, I find most of Google's apps redundant because I really love Samsung's apps. I actually did the same as you haha! I purchased an app to delete all of Google's apps except Youtube and Maps and a few of Samsung's too. I think there are people who use Samsung apps and people who use Google apps. Not referring to you, but some people like to think Google apps are not bloatware because they themselves use them. But many people also love and use Samsung apps, myself included. Even though I love Samsung apps, I can totally understand if people are vice versa. Logically speaking, either both Samsung and Google apps are both bloatware or both not. dabug91 Lol, umm Samsung has it's own calendar app, calculator app, memo app, messaging app, etc and they're all shit. No phone has more bloatware than a Samsung phone. They win hands-down in that category. tim242 I prefer all of those to Google's offerings. I'm glad to have a choice. OligarchyAmbulance You honestly think they have higher standards for their lagfest Android skin? tim242 They have higher standards than Google/HTC with the dumpster fire that is Pixel. John Doe https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a1405ef722a16da1e676294296d43a0d524eaaf5c53be0f4ec6d89b9ab035eb1.gif M. Luciano What? Where are you getting all this? tim242 There have been numerous hardware issues reported since release. Some of which being the microphone, speakers, camera, and the display. tekfr33kn I've had my Pixel for a few months now and haven't had a single one of those problems. I know that a few people have had them but it's more rare than you you are making it out to be. Audio Or for Knox for that matter! Bob http://imgur.com/gallery/UrhOtai Middlefinger No it uses Android, which we all know is perfect/ s ... At least Samsung fixes the mess Google creates most of time though. Jumanji! Are you perhaps conflating user experience with quality/security of code? A company can make something look pretty or function, but that doesn't mean there aren't any issues with the security of their code. Computer science isn't an exact science and creating software is always a series of trade offs. Middlefinger No im basing it on all the problem Google has with its own devices and how much time OEMs have to spend fixing Google code before they release it on their own devices. Jumanji! What do you expect? Android is a big, complex platform and there are a number of OEMs who blend it with their own, unique hardware variations and services. It's absolutely normal for customers to find defects in shipping products. It's ultimately how the company reacts to customer facing defects and issues that really matters. I'd love to see a list of the volume of defects that OEMs have fixed in the Android platform. I think data has the potential of strengthening your arguments rather than having them appear to be nothing but hyperbole. Middlefinger Not all fixes they make is committed back to stock. Much of what the OEMs do is proprietary, but given that OEM devices dont have the problems AOSP based devices do its reasonable to say they fixed something. If all the Google devices had identical hardware you could argue the problem is which specific hardware, but thats not the case. Regardless of the hardware the problem persists because the problems are in Googles code. Zsolt V You are right in everything you wrote. Congrats, finally a sane voice. F4LL0U7 If that was sincere and not sarcastic, thanks! JohnyNoLegs Haha doesn't run Tizen. Fail. Google code their own bugs anyway. F4LL0U7 No shit, try reading the rest of the thread. Vivek Rameses That's odd, some people think Israel is worst place humanity has ever seen. Sruly J Do you get a thrill connecting politics go something totally not related to that? Suicide_Note And that has to do with Samsung's poor coding......how, exactly? https://media.giphy.com/media/Qy9hRuWrKjY2I/giphy.gif Vivek Rameses Just pointing out facts. Sruly J Which are totally irrelevant to this topic. Vivek Rameses Shouldn't be in the title then. No, shows the credibility of said researcher.

Especially since they would be stating the same facts. EcE By that logic, all Americans are orange liars with tiny hands. Suicide_Note And some might say that whatever country you're from is the worst but, again, what would that have to do with Samsung's poor coding? marcusmarcus2 In that case, here is a link to 500 useless facts that have the same relevance to this article.

Let the Android Developers do their thing as they do it so well. tim242 This has nothing to do with Android... EcE Exactly what he is saying... dump Tizen and stick to Android tim242 I don't think they will be dumping Android. It would be too much of a change for their userbase. But if they were to do that, I would surely dump them. The problem is, I don't care for any other Android manufacturer. HTC is not the proper ODM for Google, too many issues. Drunk Squirrel Did you even read what he said? He clearly said "dump TIZEN", "NOT Android"! Nicholas Conrad I don't think he really reads what anybody says. Drakenoid Which is why I blocked him ages ago and you should too. Middlefinger Yeah, because Android is so great. How many Nexus devices have rebooted randomly today i wonder? MJ That a thing? I don't recall my Nexus 7 which have had for three years ever randomly rebooting. I used a Nexus 5 actively for 2 1/2 years and remember a short period where I had to MANUALLY reboot it a couple of times a week. My Pixel XL has been stable and just as fast/smooth since day one. JohnyNoLegs Pixel XL here, required one RMA, 3 factory resets. Bluetooth is still dodgy. Google Play music is dodgy, it doesn't play for more than 30 mins without stopping audio. LOL at you thinking Google/Nexus?Pixel is any better LOLOLOLOLOL MJ OK, you had a bad phone. So? I have owned more than three Nexus/Pixel devices with no major issues. Regardless, I was responding specifically to the random rebooting issue the OP mentioned that I have never seen. JohnyNoLegs Nexus 5X random reboots. My wife RMA'd it within the first 6 months. 6P battery would die when it got to 30%, RMA'd that and the 6P i got, android system used loads of battery and I would barely get 1.5 hrs SOT even after factory resets. Then bought Note7, was leaps and bounds ahead of the Nexus 5X and 6P, except for the whole risk of exploding....THen I got the Pixel, which yea sure it's always fast at first, but it does so much less than the Note 7, and now my Pixel struggles at points anyway. I have owned every nexus except for the 6, I have also owned nearly all LG G series and Galaxy series. The most Issues I have had are with nexus devices, mostly to do with updates. Airoid Sammy is fu#ked Suicide_Note Hardly. It just means they'll be using Android for a good while longer. shadowx360 Samsung has at least matched (or surpassed) Apple in terms of design and manufacturing of hardware, but is Chinese-OEM level when it comes to software. Articles like these are why I stick with Pixel/Nexus devices. If they want to be taken seriously, they need to find competent software engineers - the GS8 announcement articles were shortly followed by articles showing you can beat the new facial recognition by using a flat photo. Suicide_Note To be fair, you can fool Google's facial recognition with a photo, too. OligarchyAmbulance To be fair, you can't unless you have a photo which blinks. Suicide_Note It's not at all hard to create a photo that 'blinks'. M. Luciano lol? for muggles? Ian Santopietro That actually blinks? No, that's impossible. But it's not hard to make a photo which tricks the software into thinking it blinked, which is why I assume that guy put 'blinks' in single-quotes. Suicide_Note You get it. Thank you. Carson Saldanha He's a wizard bruh Carson Saldanha Yes, that is "Smart Lock" and if I'm not mistaken, I think Google even put a warning of this. They also didn't advertise this as a "feature". Abhilash Bingi TBF Google also introduced the Face Unlock feature back in 2011 (with ICS and the Galaxy Nexus) which could be fooled by a photo. But it warned you that it's not completely safe and can be fooled by a photo when you tried to activate it. Joannaescott Google is paying $97 per hour!

Google likes to whip things up quick and throw spaghetti on the wall to see what sticks. There's lots of mistakes in that process. Also, Samsung specifically stated face unlock is not intended to be a secure locking method. They specifically said it's analogous to slide to unlock, so I don't understand why people are misunderstanding this as a "security flaw" when it's not. Justin That's why Google removed Face Unlock in Lollipop. Abhilash Bingi What? No. It just got renamed to 'Trusted face' and moved to Smart Lock along with 'Trusted places' location and 'Trusted Devices'. It's still an option on my Pixel. OligarchyAmbulance Same here. If this is how they treat their own OS, I have no hope for their version of Android. You're lucky if you even get a security patch from them. byteseyes Samsung's the only company out of all manufacturers that releases monthly security patches actually. Pretty awesome. OligarchyAmbulance No, Google does too. byteseyes I mentioned out of all manufacturers. Google's not a manufacturer. That's why I was pointing out that it makes Samsung special. OligarchyAmbulance The Pixel, Pixel C, Chromebook Pixel, Home, Chromecast, Chromecast Audio, Google WiFi, and Daydream would disagree with you. byteseyes Um, I thought it was quite obvious we're talking about phones, given that we're discussing Android and monthly security patches on smartphones. What does a laptop or a router have anything to do with smartphones? Besides, the Pixel phone was not manufactured by Google. Regardless, this doesn't change my original statement that Samsung is the only manufacturer that releases monthly security patches (for their smartphones, in case I wasn't explicit enough), and nobody considers Google a manufacturer, even with Google's nascent foray into the fringe hardware products you listed. In time, Google may become a manufacturer too. Who knows. OligarchyAmbulance "Google's not a manufacturer." "Um, I thought it was quite obvious we're talking about phones" Google is a manufacturer of many devices. That was the point. "Besides, the Pixel phone was not manufactured by Google" Right, and iPhones are made by Foxconn. So technically speaking, Apple has never updated an Apple device. byteseyes Um, you do realize you're arguing about absolutely nothing right now? I never denied Google updates their phone. I already knew Google updates their phone. I was stating that Samsung, a phone manufacturer, is the only OEM that releases monthly security patches, a direct contradiction to your initial statement "You're lucky if you even get a security patch from them." OligarchyAmbulance "Samsung, a phone manufacturer, is the only OEM that releases monthly security patches" They're the only OEM if you don't include another OEM. lol byteseyes Google's an OEM? Apple's OEM? That's news to everyone. tim242 Android's face unlock was the same. Besides, Samsung tells you that it is low security. You are just a nasty google sheep. EcE While I don't disagree, it's been 5 or 6 years. If Samsung was going to implement it, at least try harder. My guess is that it was a last minute addition due to the rumored onscreen fingerprint sensor they had to ditch. Shame-sung C.E.O Says the Current-C Shill who is a sheep to Swinesung now.

But you should more often : ) Carson Saldanha -___________________________________________- Shame-sung C.E.O This has nothing to do with Apple. SWINESUNG is a huge dishonest,Corrupt,Horrible company who will be always known for stealing , profit, sued, settle. Speculation on what Apple is going to do = Nothing.

Peter World Citizen Your Korean boyfriend left you recently? ;) Shame-sung C.E.O why are you sharing what your mother told you? Kind of random LOL!! Defenestratus Google's software development isn't by any means stellar either. John Doe It is definitly more secure than Samsung and better designed. Google has a project zero team so find security flaws and it works great...I wonder why they haven't looked at Tizen OS lmao Zsolt V It's by not stellar you mean that it's the best out of all commercial companies you are right.... QwertyJuan To be fair... if you lose your phone, there is a HIGH chance that the person finding it has NO idea who you are, doesn't possess any pictures of you, thereby making the facial recognition feature a decent level of security. No... it won't stop your younger brother or one of your friends from "hacking" your phone when you are asleep. :) P.S. Samsung ALSO has a retina scanner built into the phone which is actually MORE secure than even a fingerprint scanner and for some reason we hear NOTHING about this feature. whispy_snippet It's less secure for the very reasons you just outlined. It's easier to get a photo of someone than their fingerprint. Drakenoid Not if you're a common thief, then it's easier to get their fingerprints off the phone than their pic. whispy_snippet I'm sceptical that a common thief has the tools and/or technical know-how to obtain and then exploit someone's finger print. It's not easy. Drakenoid True, but it's then also unlikely for them to get photo of the owner. My name is…. Oh yes, the classic douche that says "that's why i stick with Pixel/Nexus devices" Because Android was never full of holes or the Pixel deserves the iphone-like price tag. Zsolt V It's better than an iPhone, so why shouldn't it be priced so? Justin You know what's worse than GoPro Sheeps? Nexus Sheeps. YaKillaCJ Hold up now, while I agree that Samsung suck in the software department, I disagree with the Chinese OEM part. Let's not forget that Xiaomi has the best update record, even surpassing Google depending how ya look at it. Also OnePlus has been really good and ZTE not bad at all. Zsolt V What does update speed have anything to do with this topic? jodieisme Security patch..? Zsolt V So Samsung doesn't deliver timely monthly patches? mma173 Xiaomi is a way better than Google. MIUI has so many advantages over the other Android roms. But the one has to admit that they took their "inspiration" from Apple :) especially in the early days. Drakenoid True, I wish they would update the basic usability of MIUI to be more in line with Android, specially now that Android does a lot of things better. They don't have to serve Google's Android just an updated version with better design. I love their features though. Though Xiaomi doesn't provide security patches to Mi 5 as fast as they should. Zsolt V So you 3D print a face, no difference. Adam Truelove Agree, Stock Android managed by Google running on an S8 would be wonderful. Samsung makes great hardware, but absolute garbage software. JohnyNoLegs Samsung states it isn't secure man. SAM I had read about Tizen code and management and no wonder this article makes sense. Read what other programmers had to say abt tizen https://what.thedailywtf.com/topic/15687/code-review-malediction https://what.thedailywtf.com/topic/15001/enlightened Suicide_Note I view Tizen as being akin to the dark language of Mordor, and should never be spoken of. marcusmarcus2 What? Now you just made Tizen sound kinda cool. Jordan Palmer Well done. Bewear Die, T(ouchW)izen, die. YouNex That's why #NeverSamsung JohnyNoLegs Yea, go with some other small company that must have great developers and code review policies...LOL Audio This has always been my fear about tizen and why I can't buy the gear s3 watch, ESPECIALLY for using Samsung Pay. It also makes me wonder about Samsung Knox, tbh... Sruly J Isn't part of Knox incorporated into Android for Work? Audio Is it? I always assumed it was separate... Doesn't Knox pre-date Android for Work? Defenestratus Yes it is integrated into Android's Security apparatus and yes, it pre-dated Android for Work (which as far as I can tell is vaporware). saf1927 Android for Work is useful to use it as way to have multiple app profiles. There's an app on the Play Store that create a work profile you can manage yourself by adding apps, etc. LineOS for exynos! Call island Sruly J Don't remember the article, but this article says that part of Knox was incorporated into Android. http://www.zdnet.com/article/google-samsung-integrate-knox-into-android-eye-enterprise-gains/ Shame-sung C.E.O LMFAO!! For years i been saying the same-thing. TIZEN OS is just pure Trash. Swinesung has always had lower standards then free boostmobile phones and Software that should be on V-Tech phones at the least( no insult to V-tech). How ever we all know Swinesung is not Special and has never been special. It's just a Sheep Mentality. Good thing there is Nexus who gives you Amazing Hardware and Software not Bloatware and Half baked products like the ones Swinesung makes. Another Fail from Swinesung. Aaron Uh, you know Nexus isn't a thing anymore, right? Middlefinger Samsung probably spends so much time fixing Googles mess on Android for its devices that there is no time for Tizen.. tekfr33kn You mean f-ing up Android - Fix'd it for ya. Middlefinger How can they f it up when they make it actually work without causing the phone to reboot randomly. Thats an Android fault that affects a number of totally different devices, its not hardware, its Googles software, again. Googles UX is just getting old now, and while yes, Touchwiz was poor in places Grace UX is far superior to whatever the hell Google is doing. Its more logical, provides more information in a better way and is fully themeable. Adam Margeson Having owned the original Android device (HTC Dream), a Nexus 5 and a Pixel on top of several others, Google's devices tend to be the more stable ones in my experience. It's other OEMs like Sony, HTC and others that tend to have problems because of code they precariously stack on top of Android. I'm not saying that Samsung's is better or worse than others', but Stock Android has been fairly stable for me. As to "Google's UX is getting old now",.. As compared to what? Samsung's is really just a highly integrated theme on top of Google's UX. Sure, the settings are moved around, the quick settings look a little different, etc, but what about General "Android" is getting old? JohnyNoLegs My experience is the opposite. Having had RMA'd my Pixel XL twice, and had to Factory Reset a few more times, that's more than all my phone prior. Given the latest Bluetooth bugs and Google Play Music bugs, I think you are just floating on cloud 9 oblivious to reality. I have come from Samsung, LG and HTC. My Nexus 5x is a whole other story, it has been even worse haha Adam Margeson My normal vehicle doesn't have Bluetooth, but the rentals I used for several weeks during the time (2017 KIA Sonata, 2016 Ford F350 and 2016 Ford Taurus) that the bug was active didn't seem to have any issues - in fact, they were overly aggressive in trying to connect even when I didn't want it to. I also don't generally use Google Play Music. So, no, I haven't been on Cloud Nine, I just haven't had the same issues other people have. That said, I was hit by the audio-clipping-at-loud-volumes bug that was there for a couple months. That was mildly (/s) annoying. I only factory reset my Nexus 5 a handful of times over the 3.5 years that I used it, and that was more a matter of having far too many apps and background services running to the point that I just reset it rather than cleaning it up. I have read AP every day since I found the site back when the Galaxy Nexus was released, and I am well aware of the bugs other people have been having. I count myself lucky that I haven't been seen most of those bugs personally. Middlefinger None of it is 'stacked on top of stock'. Its a replacement for it, the stock code isnt there. Almost all OEM android is virtually a fork, and there is no reason why i cannot be better than Googles version. whispy_snippet This is the guy who labels people "Google shills". Middlefinger Who am I shilling for? Samsung because I have their phone, LG because I have their TV, or Microsoft because i have their Tablet? Maybe im just not happy with the state of Android at the moment.. Nah, i must be a paid Samsung troll obviously. whispy_snippet So? What's your point? I have a Surface, an LG TV and a Pixel. But everyone knows phones are the most important piece of tech a person owns which is why they generate such intense discussion. You seem like a huge Samsung "shill" and a massive hypocrite. Middlefinger Everyone knows that do they? Sure if you say so, maybe if you are 14. Funny ive been accused of being a shill for Google as well, so it seems to to depend on the bias of the accuser, namely, you. whispy_snippet You're kidding. So you disagree that the smartphone is the most important and innovative piece of consumer technology this century? Mate, what planet are you living on? Middlefinger I didnt say it wasnt (it was actually invented last century, but whatever). I said its not the most essential to everyone. whispy_snippet I didn't say it was invented this century, but whatever. The statement "everyone knows" was an unbelievably poor choice of words and I can't believe I actually wrote it. But my broader point that smartphones are the most important piece of consumer technology this century still stands. My other point, that you're a hypocrite, also still stands. whispy_snippet Oh yeah. For sure man. You got it. M. Luciano This makes sense. Samsung doesn't know mobile security. They have Knox, which they purchased and then had fixed by BlackBerry. We have notifications constantly about people's dryers and refrigerators being hacked, their TV's being hacked and the only way they get out of it on Android is because someone else is handling 90%+ of the legwork, ie. Google. JohnyNoLegs Knox is better than AOSP. M. Luciano I don't believe that at all, but even if true, the point was they didn't create that. JohnyNoLegs Why would that matter who created it? keithzg Because it speaks to their ability to write good, secure software, which is what's in question here. JohnyNoLegs Well they didn't write it, so then it should be great then by your logic. You are also ASSUMING, that all dev's/dev teams/products are done by the same people, which would be a huge assumption that is probably very wrong. Samsung didn't even code Tizen anyway. M. Luciano Because if they'd have built it, they'd probably understand something about security. But they bought it and then had BlackBerry improve it. JohnyNoLegs So thats a good thing right? ast00 At the end of the day, it's still Samsung. Not surprised. Rod Samsung and poor software? Not surprised. Marty What else is new? Samsung's not known for quality software. They've gotten better with Touch-Wiz, but that's their pinnacle. Peter World Citizen All compilers should just mark strcpy() as error. ;) bekifft Worse than this, Tizen runs on refrigerators, and all that other "smart" crap. People are connecting this junk to the internet and forgetting about it. This is the kind of stuff that causes problems like Mirai. JohnyNoLegs Linux runs on refrigerators, and all that other smart crap. Are you saying the devs that made all that smart crap did it better? Andy J So..... um...... anyone know what the SmartThings hubs run on then? Are we facing a potential situation where they could be hijacked. D13H4RD2L1V3 Here's something, though. Tizen technically isn't made by Samsung entirely. It's a project within the Linux Foundation and developed and overseen by the Tizen Association. As you'd expect, Samsung is a member, but so are other companies such as Huawei and Intel. Despite that, only Samsung has actually implemented the OS in their products. Given the shocking number of security holes, I can only assume that it was far from ready. Even though Samsung's Android skin is better than previous iterations, I don't particularly hold it in super-high regard because software has never been Samsung's forte. And I think they should make it so soon as their hardware gets better and better. Đức Thành I am not the least bit surprised, but that part about the legacy of Bada OS living on was particularly hilarious. mma173 Software industry especially OSs is a very specialized resource-intensive field. I wish Samsung should give up working on OSs to free up resources. ROB Can he also work on getting Nougat to the unlocked S7s ?

Pegasus malware expands from iOS to Android by Michael Heller Senior Reporter One of the more malicious iOS threats -- Pegasus malware -- has made its way to Android devices and it has some dangerous new tricks in its arsenal.

Pegasus malware had been exclusive to iOS and was particularly interesting because it leveraged a trio of iOS vulnerabilities in order to infect devices. Researchers at Lookout said the malware has expanded to Android devices and may prove more dangerous on that platform. According to Mike Murray, vice president of security intelligence at Lookout, the Android variant of Pegasus -- called Chrysaor by Google -- was developed by the same NSO Group that was found targeting political dissidents, rights activists and journalists with the Pegasus malware. "NSO Group has sophisticated mobile spyware capabilities across a number of operating systems that are actively being used to target individuals," Murray wrote in a blog post. "After looking into these signals, we determined that an Android version of Pegasus was running on phones in Israel, Georgia, Mexico, Turkey, the UAE and others." Both Lookout and Google confirmed that the Pegasus malware could be used to capture screenshots, keystrokes or audio and also exfiltrate data from messaging apps, browsers, email and contacts. Murray also noted the software can "self-destruct" if it "feels its position is at risk." "Pegasus is the most advanced Android [remote access Trojan] malware to have ever been detected in real world usage," Liviu Arsene, senior e-threat researcher at Romania-based antimalware firm Bitdefender, told SearchSecurity. "Extremely versatile, it is able to sniff communications, steal messages and call records from instant messaging like WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, Skype and Gmail. It also packs key-logging and capabilities to take screenshots, it can even take control of the phone's camera and microphone." Murray said the Pegasus malware "was built to be stealthy, targeted and is very sophisticated" and includes new techniques not seen in the iOS version to make it "easier to deploy." "Pegasus for Android does not require zero-day vulnerabilities to root the target device and install the malware. Instead, the threat uses an otherwise well-known rooting technique called Framaroot," Murray wrote. "In the case of Pegasus for iOS, if the zero-day attack execution failed to jailbreak the device, the attack sequence failed overall. In the Android version, however, the attackers built in functionality that would allow Pegasus for Android to still ask for permissions that would then allow it to access and exfiltrate data. The failsafe jumps into action if the initial attempt to root the device fails." Pegasus malware poses limited risk However, despite being easier to deploy, the Pegasus malware doesn't appear to be widespread. Google said it "observed fewer than three dozen installs" of the malware in the 1.4 billion devices protected by Google Play services and Verify Apps. "Late last year, after receiving a list of suspicious package names from Lookout, we discovered that a few dozen Android devices may have installed an application related to Pegasus, which we named Chrysaor. Although the applications were never available in Google Play, we immediately identified the scope of the problem by using Verify Apps," Google researchers wrote in a blog post. "We gathered information from affected devices, and concurrently, attempted to acquire Chrysaor apps to better understand its impact on users. We've contacted the potentially affected users, disabled the applications on affected devices, and implemented changes in Verify Apps to protect all users." Google said "one representative sample" of the Pegasus malware was analyzed and found to be "tailored to devices running Jellybean (4.3) or earlier." According to Google's metrics, those versions of Android make up 12.6% of current devices, or approximately 176 million devices. Google also noted users would need to be coaxed into installing a malicious app from an untrusted source in order to be infected, but it has already made improvements to Verify Apps to protect all Android devices that have Google Play services. Michael Patterson, CEO of Plixer, said Pegasus malware could still be dangerous despite the rooting method mostly targeting older devices. "The malware is still dangerous because malware evolves over time like most software that is maintained. Malicious software is often given away or stolen and used to create new variants," Patterson told SearchSecurity. "While the malware is impacting phones five years old, the latest release could be better at evading detection and have new, richer theft features. Companies should have a network traffic analysis solution which is monitoring for odd traffic behaviors from mobile devices." Arsene suggested the standard protections for Android users: "To protect your Android devices install apps from legitimate sources, make sure you have the latest OS updates and security patches, enable a lock screen, ensure you run an anti-malware app, and check on a regular basis what are the apps that have admin rights on your device."

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Steven Overly By Steven Overly April 5 at 7:22 PM Follow @stevenoverly This file photo taken on September 13, 2016 shows pilot models of the Uber self-driving car at the Uber Advanced Technologies Center in Pittsburgh, Pa. (Angelo Merendino/Agence-France Presse via Getty Images) A federal judge told Uber that he could bar a top executive from working on its self-driving vehicle program if the company does not more fully investigate accusations that its employees stole intellectual property from Waymo, which was formerly a part of Google. The ongoing lawsuit embroils two of Silicon Valley’s leading developers of self-driving technology, which experts predict will fundamentally transform transportation in the decades to come. Waymo contends that three former employees took thousands of documents containing trade secrets, then used the information to build self-driving technology now used at Uber, legal documents show. U.S. District Judge William Alsup instructed Uber to conduct a more exhaustive search for 14,000 documents that were allegedly taken from Waymo. “This is an extraordinary case, I’ve never seen a record this strong in 42 years,” Alsup told Uber. “So you are up against it. You are looking at a preliminary injunction even if what you tell me is true. What you are telling me is not going to be a get out of jail free card.” Waymo filed a lawsuit in February seeking to stop Uber from using technology based on intellectual property it claims was stolen. The suit claimed that Anthony Levandowski and two other employees took the documents when they left Google for a self-driving competitor that was later acquired by Uber, where the three now work. At Wednesday’s hearing, Uber presented details for the first time about its own efforts to investigate the allegations. Arturo Gonzalez, an attorney for Uber, told the court that none of the documents were found on Uber’s servers. “We can’t produce something that we do not have,” Gonzalez said. [Who’s winning the self-driving car race? It’s not the company you think] Gonzalez said the company discovered one of the documents on a device allegedly belonging to Sameer Kshirsagar, one of the other employees accused in court documents of stealing trade secrets, Tech Crunch reported. Radu Raduta is the third employee. Levandowski, Kshirsagar or Raduta are not named as parties in the lawsuit. Uber questioned 85 current and former employees, and searched the computers of 10 of them. The company agreed to search for the documents more extensively after Wednesday’s hearing. Representatives and attorneys for Waymo and Uber declined to comment or did not respond to interview requests. On Friday, Uber is expected to outline its argument against Waymo’s request for an injunction that would stop Uber from using the disputed self-driving technology until the case is resolve. The company is also attempting to move the case to arbitration, and a hearing on that motion is scheduled for later this month. Levandowski previously worked on Google’s self-driving car project, now named Waymo, before leaving to start another autonomous driving company called Otto last year. That firm was quickly acquired by Uber for $680 million and Levandowski now heads Uber’s self-driving car program. Last week, Waymo also accused Levandowski of working with two competing companies, Tyto Lidar and Odin Wave, while still a Google employee. Tyto Lidar was later acquired by Otto, according to Waymo. Levandowski has invoked the Fifth Amendment, which protects a person from incriminating himself, and declined to provide information to Uber. He remains an Uber employee. The outcome of the lawsuit could alter the future of both companies. Waymo and its parent company, Alphabet, have poured large sums of money into the development and testing of self-driving technology. In January, the company announced it had created its own sensors to control the hardware that feeds images and other data to its software. Uber has moved aggressively to develop and test its autonomous cars on roads in California, Pennsylvania and Arizona. The company poses a threat to Waymo in a marketplace whose competitors already include the world’s largest automakers and other technology companies. [Uber relying on stolen Google technology in its self-driving cars, lawsuit alleges] “Competition should be fueled by innovation in the labs and on the roads, not through unlawful actions,” a Waymo spokesperson said previously. “Given the strong evidence we have, we are asking the court step in to protect intellectual property developed by our engineers over thousands of hours and to prevent any use of that stolen IP.” Industry observers expect that self-driving vehicles will first hit the road as part of ride-sharing fleets, giving Uber and its competitor Lyft a natural advantage over other players. (In 2016, Lyft secured a $500 million investment from General Motors to partner on self-driving efforts.) The technology could also bring big financial benefits to Uber’s business, which news reports say continues to lose money despite significant growth. Uber shares a portion of the revenue from each ride with its drivers, and that expense could go away over time as its fleet of vehicles becomes more autonomous. “We are incredibly proud of the progress that our team has made,” Uber has previous said in a statement. “We have reviewed Waymo’s claims and determined them to be a baseless attempt to slow down a competitor and we look forward to vigorously defending against them in court. In the meantime, we will continue our hard work to bring self-driving benefits to the world.” Read more from The Washington Post’s Innovations section.  business on-innovations innovations Dallas shooting updates News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 follow-dallas false after3th false Please provide a valid email address.

Google announces PAX, a cross-licensing program to stop patent litigation among Android OEMs David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/04/03 2:43pm PDTApr 3, 2017 12 Plus 1 on G+ 48 Share on Facebook 56 Share on Twitter Total Shares116 Android OS Legal Google announced the existence of a new program known as PAX today, which apparently stands for Android Networked Cross-License Agreement (someone should tell Google how acronyms work). PAX is intended to reduce litigation between Android device makers by granting royalty-free licenses to any Android-related patents held by its members to all other members. Google, Samsung, LG, HTC, Foxconn, HMD Global, Coolpad, BQ, and Allview are the founding members, which Google claims collectively control over 230,000 patents globally. Membership in PAX is free and open to any company in the business of making Android stuff. There's no obligation for Android OEMs to join, either. How's it work? Great question! We don't know. The PAX license agreement is confidential and only made available to members of the PAX group. This means we actually have no idea what kind of leverage Google is exerting through this new program, nor what members are being asked to give or give up as part of joining. Google just want us to know that PAX will be good for reducing patent litigation, because joining PAX means you're agreeing not to sue other members over certain patents. OK. It's very easy to see how Google's creation of this initiative may draw more negative attention than positive. While reducing unnecessary patent litigation is a noble goal, it's just as easy to argue that Google is using its considerable clout among its partners in an attempt to disarm them of their intellectual property. After all, if a manufacturer holds out and doesn't join PAX, it could make them a potential target for litigation. But by joining PAX, that company could then potentially be less competitive if it loses the ability to assert some of its own intellectual property against rivals who are also in PAX. It's a double-edged blade. Massive conglomerates like Samsung and LG have incentive to join, as it will lower the likelihood they'd be the target of patent lawsuits, a constant thorn in the side of many major corporations. Smaller companies arguably do have similar reasons to get on board, but they will likely have far more to weigh in terms of the value of their IP portfolio and the benefits of joining a massive cross-license program. Indeed, this looks and feels like yet another tool in Google's growing belt of methods to ensure the Android ecosystem functions as Google wants it to. It may very well prove a positive - patent litigation is out of control, particularly in the United States. But there is a growing chorus of voices suggesting that for all the talk of openness and choice, "Google's" Android is increasingly coming with a lot of rules. PAX membership isn't compulsory, but that initial list of partners includes some big names, so there were probably some pretty good reasons for the likes of Samsung and Foxconn to get on board. We'll probably never hear much about PAX, given its confidentiality, but I sure would like to read that license. Source: Pax, Google Tags android pax law legal pax subscribe ...

The door have long been blown right open. We basically know almost everything before all of this year's flagships were even announced, even with the iphones lol antonio cesar but not really on the software side, all we knew about the latest touchwiz for instance was that it had bixby, and nothing about other oems Syukri Lajin Because there's not much to talk about. Lol. most leaks aren't really leaks, they are just "leaked" to build up hypes. that is why most of the time you only hear about things that end up being marketed a lot. antonio cesar yes i only hear about marketed things, thats why i meant a door for leaks, kinda like fcc, sure the media will only make coverage about something that a lot of people care (and im not complaining about that), but i, as a normal person could possibly get information about changes that i care and that don't receive coverage. JD So now all those big players will be able to safely keep their IPs neatly stored away in their closets. Matt I know the acronym part was a joke, but just in case you weren't aware, pax is Latin for peace; I would assume that was what Google was going for. David Ruddock Yep, I'm aware what it means. Funem It actually means "A call for a truce, used especially by schoolchildren when playing." which if you think about the way companies are with taking people to court regarding patents, its probably a more accurate representation of PAX. Djakdekiel ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Meh, I'll join tomorrow Devin Rodriguez Patent Access Cross? Funem Apple will say its anti competitive, the US courts will then allow Apple to use any of the shared patents, but, as Apple aren't a member of PAX they will not have to share their own patents. This would be funny, if I didn't actually think it has the possibility of happening. Jordan That won't happen at all. Like, there is no possible way that would happen. Nicholas Conrad Yeah, apple will just claim to have invented all the patents covered by PAX then go 'thermonuclear war' on the members. thereasoner That's exactly what Apple does with frand patents. They have the same access to the frand pool as everyone else and demand the same rates but contribute very little to the frand pool of patents themselves. Typical of the DB's that run that awful company. Roger Siegenthaler You do know what frand is... the point of frand is so standardised systems can't be abused by the patent holders (Qualcomm)... There's nothing that apple does that should be standardised and therefore nothing they could contribute to the frand pool. Drakenoid There actually are things Apple can contribute but they don't, like their processor tech. Syukri Lajin I have a feeling microsoft will get on board. This is an opportunity for them to get into good terms with all android phone makers. Microsoft edition everything coming! Lol Funem Microsoft make money on Android phone sales due to patents. In theory they have nothing to gain from joining as they would lose they money. Syukri Lajin they are trying to put their products into android phones. and getting in good term with android makers is the first step to this. they might be losing money for the patents, but they can offset it by putting their software and services into the phone,which is also better for long term profit. the bad news for us is that we'll get more bloatware. lol Funem They make literally billions every year from Android phone sales, they wont write that off just to put their products onto other manufacturers devices, they would make a deal to reduce payments to put their products onto them (they are already doing this with Samsung) but I doubt if they would join and write their royalties completely off, they would lose all their income from Android sales AND lose all their ability to leverage their software onto other manufacturers devices as manufacturers would have free access to all the patents with no obligations to Microsoft to add their products to their devices. Gerardo Sarabia What about Waymo? they have nothing to do with Android, but if Google/Alphabet is gonna pretend being the good guy in the industry, I think they should do it for real, or are the other subsidiaries not supposed to be as "cool" as Google? Anyway, I think this PAX thing is good for Android. LaserWraith Wait, so you think Waymo should just let Uber steal its trade secrets just so they can be "good guys"? It looks like Waymo vs Uber isn't even related to patents, but trade secrets instead. So I'm not sure what you're talking about here. YuCMi Wtf are you talking about? Did you even read the article? Waymo has nothing to do with Pax, and the lawsuit is about stealing trade secrets. If Google did nothing, Uber would be profiting off of their years of R&D for free, while destroying Google's competitive advantage. You go ahead and create a new invention, patent it, then let everyone take advantage of it for free and tell me how well that goes for you financially. Gerardo Sarabia Did you even read my comment? First thing I said is I know it had nothing to do with Android/PAX. YuCMi That doesn't change the validity of the rest of my comment. The beginning of your second sentence confused me, which is why I did not pick up on you saying Waymo is unrelated. Still though, your comment was completely off topic from Pax. Infringing on patents can happen involuntarily, and are more of a case of copying or reproducing. What happened with Waymo is actual theft, breaches of legal contracts, and conspiracy, among other things. Gerardo Sarabia Yeah... who cares how it happened. Either you are copying or not. Either you are open about sharing those ideas so costumers benefit from competition, or you aren't. I understand the difference, don't get me wrong, but this has been the argument Google (now Alphabet) has been giving the media and users for a long time. Now that I think about it, it actually has a lot to do with PAX, big coincidence PAX is happening now that Google is making hardware, they need freedom around those patents more than ever, not for Android but for themselves. Basically Google can get away with entering iOS/Apple's market and even use Oracle's Java in order to do so, but Uber shouldn't? I understand the difference from stealing and copying but there's clearly some conflict on these ideals. Maybe Waymo should just sue the guy that stole those files instead of Uber if that's the problem. YuCMi No, there is no conflict. You are just making it up in your head because you seem to have this idea that Google should be passive about everything and not defend itself. It seems that you are not well informed about the history of Google's Java/Oracle lawsuit either. Philippe Pax is not an acronym it simply means a truce. JG It's actually Latin for Peace. As in Pax Romana (Roman Peace) Miles∙Prower It's also a sorta-acronym for PAtent CROSS-licensing. PA for patent. X for cross.

Sweet...They should've thought of this years ago though... JG Google does (or at least did) have a parent share agreement with Samsung and someone else... I wouldn't be opposed to finding or this enhances that and allows OEMs to share features easier. I would love to see Google's 3 new phones come equipped with Samsung's NFC/MST hybrid to allow Android Pay to work on non-NFC PoS locations. Maybe their Qi/PMA hybrid to, should Google return wireless charging to their devices. The S7's dual SIM tray would be nice to as it would allow us to have microSD support on the Pixel. Drakenoid I would love Android Pay with MST!!! That would be dream come true! Also fast wireless charging!!! Though I am sure Samsung doesn't hold the patent for hybrid wireless those are held by the alliances.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « The Trump Administration is set to meet Top Foreign Business Leaders including Samsung about Investments and More | Main | Uniloc Sues Apple on Three Counts of Patent Infringement Covering iOS 7's Frequent Locations Feature & more » April 05, 2017 Apple Patent Reveals an Echo-Like Device while explaining how Siri will coordinate iDevices to perform a Specific Task   Last week the US Patent & Trademark Office published a patent application from Apple relating to a new Siri function whereby it could intelligently coordinate and pass on a user's request to the appropriate iDevice in the home or office to perform. Today such a request would result in either duplicative or conflicting operations by each of a user's iDevices within the same environment. Apple has created a device prioritization system so that iDevices receiving an instruction for Siri would work in concert with each other to perform a specific task instead of annoyingly duplicating the same action on multiple iDevices.   One of the small bonuses of this patent filing is that an Apple engineer added a Google Home or Amazon Echo-like device that works with Siri in the home as highlighted in the partial patent figure in our cover graphic and again below.   While Apple acknowledges the mysterious device #608 along with others like an iPhone, TV and Apple Watch, they never break out device #608 to describe it in any way. The closest they get is briefly mentioning a "Speaker Dock" later in the filing – though they never specifically link it back to device #608 to confirm it.   Yet clearly we're able to see that it's a speaker-like device that could understand instructions for Siri, so it's not a boom box. It's been rumored for some time now that Apple is working on a device similar to that of Google-Home or Amazon's Echo. Apple's patent figure that surfaced last week confirms, as far as the patent is concerned, a viable concept that's on the table.   Siri to Coordinate Multiple iDevices to perform a Task   In respect to intelligent identification of devices in a multi-device system, Apple provides us with a full example of how it's intended to work.   In some examples, natural language inputs are resolved into one or more tasks by a single device of the electronic devices #602 to #608 identified below as an Apple Watch, an iPhone, a TV (or TV with Apple TV box) and a speaker device like Google Home.   Apple notes that once the spoken audio input has been sampled, one of the electronic devices may be identified as a first device used to determine the task based on the sampled audio input.   The first device used to determine the task may, for instance, be identified based a set of prioritization rules.   By way of example, the first device may be the device whose sampled audio input has the greatest quality of speech, sound pressure level, and/or volume.   In the example shown above, the user is sending a request directly to Siri on his Apple Watch. So in this scenario, the Apple Watch is shown to be the official "first device" within this new prioritized system, as it is closest to the user's audio instruction and thereby the device that is delivering the greatest quality of speech and so forth as set out above.   Basic Task Overview   Apple notes that tasks may be determined locally or remotely. A device, such as Apple Watch may locally determine the task using the sampled audio input or may transmit data representing the sampled audio input to one or more servers. The task may be determined by the one or more servers based on the transmitted data and provided to the device. Optionally, one or more devices may provide an output after the task has been determined.   Once the task has been determined, one of the electronic devices (#602-#608) may be identified as a second device used to perform the task. In some examples, the second device may be identified based on task requirements.   A task may require it be performed by a device having a particular capability (e.g., functionality). In Apple's scenario above, the task may be directed to provide the user with an 'R-Rated Movie' that requires a device with the best display capability.   Accordingly, Apple Watch may determine which of the user's devices (iDevices, Macs or TV) within a multi-device environment at home would satisfy the display capability requirement.   Because multiple devices may satisfy a task requirement, the second device may additionally or alternatively be identified in accordance with a plurality of prioritization rules.   In some examples, the second device may be a device "best suited" to perform the task. For tasks directed to video playback, for instance, the second device may be an electronic device having the largest display. That could translate to a future Mac Pro mega 8K display or a television.   Uniquely Apple never mentions a set-top-box or the like as they've done in past patent filings in describing Apple TV. In this patent they only list a television. No use getting stuck on that point, but it's noteworthy to remember should they deliver a smart TV sometime down the road.   Apple further notes that for tasks directed to mapping functions, the second device may be a mobile device. In some examples, the second device may be identified based on prior use. For example, the device typically used to perform a task may be identified to perform subsequent iterations of the task or similar tasks. In some embodiments, the second device may be identified based on signal strength between the first device and each of the other devices.   In some examples, the second device may delay performance of the task. A task may, for instance, include one or more criteria that must be satisfied prior to the task being performed.   A task may require a user cease driving (e.g., as determined by GPS) prior to the task being performed (also covered in this patent), and/or may require a particular form of connectivity (e.g., Bluetooth) prior to the task being performed, for example.   Authentication   As another example, a task may require that a user be authenticated prior to the task being performed. With reference to Apple's patent FIG. 7A noted above, a user may provide an audio input #702 requesting playback of an R-rated movie and the request may be resolved into a task, for instance, by the Apple #602, for playback of an R-rated movie on the user's TV #606.   Because of the nature of the movie's rating, the task may first require that the user be authenticated. Authentication may be implemented using biometric authentication (e.g., fingerprint authentication) and/or credential authentication (e.g., username and password) – audio biometrics revealed in yesterday's report titled "Apple Patent Reveals a New Security Feature Coming to Siri."   With reference to Apple's patent FIG. 7B noted above, we're able to see that the user's iPhone #604 may provide input requests #712 such as "Please enter your Tough ID" message on the display.   As illustrated in FIG. 7C, the user may provide a biometric input and the user's iPhone may authenticate the user. In some examples, the iPhone may provide outputs #722 (Ok, playing R-Rated Movie on the TV – in written form) or #724 (in a verbal response) respectively acknowledging completion of authentication and that the R-rated movie is being played on the user's TV.   Miscellaneous Patent Points of Interest   "In some examples, the audio input can represent and/or contain a user request. For example, the audio input may include the request "Play the latest episode of Game of Thrones," thereby requesting playback of the most recent episode of the television show Game of Thrones." It's unclear if this translates to choosing TV episodes only available for a fee on iTunes or episodes available on cable TV.   Lastly, Apple notes that "It should also be recognized that in some examples, text input can be received at instead of audio input. For example, text input representing a user request can be received from the user via a suitable user interface on one or more of the plurality of electronic devices. Examples of suitable user interfaces for receiving text input can include a virtual keyboard, a handwriting recognition interface, a gesture recognition interface, and the like."   Apple's patent application was filed back in Q2 2016. Considering that this is a patent application, the timing of such a product to market is unknown at this time.   Apple has been busy advancing Siri of late with a patent about audio biometrics and a visual system for Siri. Additional Siri specific advancements could be revealed later this week.   Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office. Readers are cautioned that the full text of any patent application should be read in its entirety for full and accurate details.

Image Credit: Screenshot Google today is announcing that it’s contributing to the development of a new submarine cable that will send data to and from Singapore, Indonesia, and two cities in Australia. Other companies going in on the cable include AARNet, Indosat Ooredoo, Singtel, SubPartners, and Telstra. The new 5,600-mile Indigo cable will have an 18Tbps capacity and will be online in mid-2019, Michael Francois, Google’s internet infrastructure development partnerships manager for Australia, and Brian Quigley, Google director of global network infrastructure, wrote in a blog post. Alcatel Submarine Networks, a division of Nokia, will lay the cable across the Indian Ocean, they wrote. Indigo will be the seventh submarine cable in which Google has invested in. Others include Faster, Marea, and PLCN. Other companies that have backed the construction of undersea cables to provide faster data delivery include Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft. In the public cloud business, Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure are believed to be smaller than Google’s Cloud Platform. Google has previously announced plans to operate regions of cloud data centers in Singapore and Sydney, both of which will be serviced by Indigo. AWS already operates regions in both of those places; Azure has a region in Singapore and in the Australian states of New South Wales and Victoria.

Sure, we're talking about the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones, but let's not forget that the company also launched the Home smart speaker and its own wireless mesh networking solution. Google Home and Google Wifi are each priced at $129 a pop at the moment. Yet Google is apparently looking into combining the two. That's right, the next Google Home may come with a built-in mesh Wi-Fi router. That is, if a new report allegedly originating at "a person with knowledge of the project" pans out. You could also call the new product a Google Wifi with built-in Assistant. And a speaker, of course. There aren't any other details to speak of, but if this ever becomes reality then you should obviously expect it to cost more than a Google Home or Wifi bought separately. That said, doubling the cost wouldn't make sense, so we assume something like $199 is the most likely price point for such a device. Whether people will pony up that amount for the added convenience of having a virtual assistant in their router (or a router inside a smart speaker) remains to be seen.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Asia-Pacific, Cloud Computing, Connectivity, Featured, Google Google Invests in Submarine Cable to Speed Up Its Cloud in Asia Pacific by Yevgeniy Sverdlik  on April 5, 2017 Add Your Comments Tweet Google has invested in yet another submarine cable project to boost bandwidth of the global network backbone that interconnects its data centers around the world. The 9,000-kilometer Indigo cable will land in Singapore, Jakarta, Perth, and Sydney, boosting bandwidth between the three countries by 18 terabits per second, which is enough for people in Singapore and Sydney to hold 8 million high-definition video calls, the company said. “Many people are coming online across Asia, including businesses that depend on the cloud,” Brian Quigley, who oversees Google’s global network infrastructure, and Michael Francois, the company’s infrastructure partnership manager in Australia, wrote in a blog post. “That’s why it’s so important to enable better internet connectivity across the region.” In recent years cloud giants, including Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Amazon, have been getting more involved in submarine cable construction projects by investing in them instead of simply paying their operators (traditionally big telco consortia) to use international bandwidth. As they add users and services around the world, these companies are eager to expand network bandwidth and have found that it makes financial sense to fund these projects, each of which can cost hundreds of millions of dollars. Google has invested in more cable projects than others. Indigo, expected to come online by mid-2019, is its seventh overall and fifth in the Asia-Pacific region.

On-Screen Navigation Buttons And Failed Expectations: A Visual Analysis Martim Lobao Follow View All Posts 2016/04/05 12:22pm PDTApr 5, 2016 100 Plus 1 on G+ 80 Share on Facebook 2 Share on Twitter Total Shares182 Android OS Editorials Article Contents 1 The UI perspective 2 The hardware side of things 2.1 Smaller bezels? Nope. 3 So why do we like software buttons again? Honeycomb, the first Android version designed specifically with tablets in mind, was released way back in February 2011. It was built exclusively for large screens and was never meant to reach phones, but it paved the way for Ice Cream Sandwich, arguably one of the most significant updates to ever hit Android. Taking several cues from Honeycomb, Android 4.0 brought about some of the biggest changes to the OS, not the least of which was the advent of virtual or on-screen navigation buttons. At the time, the use of virtual buttons on phones polarized opinions: some hated the idea while others were quick to sing its praises. There were good points from either side of the fence, but as a whole (and after the dust settled), the change was mostly welcomed. In fact, Ron Amadeo — one of the more meticulous writers this site has had — actually wrote his very first article for Android Police on why he thought virtual buttons would be great for Android. Ron's arguments covered both the UI benefits and the hardware benefits of on-screen navigation buttons. There's obviously no reason to assume that his points reflect the motives Google had behind making the switch — but I'd be surprised if they didn't at least come close. Back then, Android fans were excited to see what changes this might bring about. Would we start to see phones with thinner bezels? Would it make it easier to hack Android onto all sorts of smart appliances? How would this improve the overall UI? In many ways, these ideas served as a sort of distillation of all the hopes that were riding on virtual buttons at the time, and which ultimately carried over onto today's opinions. To see how justified our expectations were, it's worth taking stock of the way things actually panned out and considering whether the supposed benefits of on-screen buttons really hold any water. The UI perspective On-screen nav buttons can change orientation with the phone so they are always in the same place. Hypothetically, this would have the advantage of offering a more flexible UI so that the navigation buttons would always be on the bottom of the screen, regardless of the phone's orientation. This is in contrast to hardware buttons, which are obviously fixed to the same place on a device and therefore cannot adapt to the orientation that a device is being held at. In practice, I'm not sure that this is strictly true, or even if it's desirable at all. For devices with screens that are roughly under 7 inches across (that's about 95% of Android devices as things currently stand), the nav bar is located on the right side of the screen when in landscape mode, so the whole idea that they will always stay in the same place on the screen is already out the window. Still, one could arguably make the point that the nav bar will always be on the bottom of the screen in portrait mode and on the right side of the screen in landscape — and that's definitely true. The issue is that the rest of the UI doesn't always change with the navigation bar, so you can sometimes end up with a hybrid layout that is a lot worse than either approach. The worst offender here is the Google Camera app (though other camera apps aren't usually any better). For whatever reason, Google thought it best that the navigation buttons should rotate along with the orientation of the screen, but chose to keep the large shutter button fixed at the bottom of the device instead. At its worst, this means that when the device is turned upside-down, the home button is on the bottom of the device, but the shutter button is on top. The shutter button just can't make up its mind "Fair enough," you say, "but this ergonomic nightmare is more of the exception than the rule." That's true: most other apps don't behave as insanely as the Google Camera app does, and this criticism may be more accurately directed at the app's developers than the concept of virtual navigation buttons itself. Even so, there are still plenty of situations where virtual buttons are more of a handicap than a benefit. Take, for instance, all those apps that only support a single device orientation and kick you into whatever layout they decide is best, irrespective of how the device is being held. For example, say you're using an app in landscape mode while holding your phone with one hand, so that it's rotated 90° clockwise and your right hand is on the top of the device. What happens if you tap the home button? Tapping the home button moves the nav bar from the left side of the screen to the right side Assuming rotation isn't enabled in your launcher, the entire navigation bar will be swept away from under your fingers, forcing you to either use both hands or to attempt a strange, single-handed shuffle so that you can reach the navigation buttons once again. The inverse scenario is also a frequent irritation for left-handed people like me: since I tend to use my phone mainly using my left hand, moving the phone into landscape mode means rotating it 90° clockwise while holding it from the bottom, so that the nav bar ends up on the top of the device, opposite to where my hand is. Again, this isn't exactly a huge problem: most people are now more than used to having to use their phone with both hands for even the simplest of tasks. The problem is that this is precisely the sort of issue that virtual nav buttons were supposed to solve, but instead they ended up creating one that didn't exist with hardware buttons. Having a standard layout for on-screen buttons makes them more consistent, doesn't allow OEMs to mess with the button order, and can even allow for greater customization. This one is sort of true, though not as much as we could have hoped for. Some OEMs have definitely embraced the flexibility provided by virtual navigation buttons, and even allow users to customize their experience almost entirely. For example, the software on LG's phones supports adding and rearranging up to 5 navigation buttons, including a button to easily pull down the notification shade or another to quickly capture a screenshot and annotate it. Most manufacturers that use software navigation buttons do stick to the standard button order, but those who don't typically don't offer any customization options, so you're basically stuck with what you get. On-screen buttons provide greater information by being adaptable to different contexts (e.g. the Back button changing orientation when the keyboard is open). They could also offer a bit of text saying what will happen when you tap it, such as showing “Quit” when Back will close an app or “Inbox” when it will bounce you back to your Gmail inbox. This is actually similar to how "nav buttons" work on iOS: in certain situations, the status bar at the top of the screen will show the name of the app that was previously open, and tapping the (very) tiny left-facing arrow will bring it up again. On Android, there are a couple of cases where the right side of the navigation bar will display extra information, such as for when a legacy app still relies on the use of a physical menu button or for displaying the little button that lets you switch keyboard apps. There are also two other times when on-screen buttons morph or change to provide additional information: when the back button points down instead of left to indicate that pressing it will hide the keyboard, and in Android N when the overview button splits into two rectangles in split-screen mode. However, aside from those few fringe cases, virtual buttons are not more informative than their hardware counterparts. They do provide a bit more context and information, but not as much as most of us imagined they would have. The hardware side of things The hardware arguments basically boil down to three points: Software buttons allow for much greater hardware flexibility, and make it easier to slap Android on anything that has a touchscreen. They look cool. Having on-screen buttons instead of hardware buttons allows OEMs to build devices with smaller bezels, larger screens, and ultimately greater screen-to-body ratios. Let's break these down, shall we? At least in theory, there's no question that having virtual buttons makes it much easier to get Android up and running on a multitude of hardware configurations. Like Ron said, all you need is a touchscreen and you're good to go. In practice, however, it's not that clear that virtual buttons really offer any significant advantage. Android Wear is devoid of any virtual (or physical) navigation buttons, since the minuscule screen size of the devices it runs on requires an entirely different UI paradigm. Unofficial products and hacks don't make much use of virtual navigation buttons either: the best smart mirror we've seen doesn't even use a touchscreen at all. The only place where software buttons have arguably made it easier to deploy Android on a hardware setup is with Android Auto — but even that is a bit of a tossup. For starters, out of the five navigation buttons in the Android Auto interface, only one of them exists in Android's traditional UI: the home button. The other four buttons are little more than glorified shortcuts to apps like Maps and the Dialer, and don't really affect the navigation pattern of Android Auto in any real way. On top of that — and this is more of a personal opinion — I'm not at all convinced that virtual buttons are the way to go with car dashboards. Call me old-fashioned, but I think there are some situations where a physical knob or a pressable button still beat a flat panel of glass, and trying to open up the Maps app while keeping your eyes on the road is probably one of them. The fact is that getting Android on anything other than a phone, tablet, or possibly even a laptop requires adjusting the UI to such an extent that it's hard to argue that using virtual buttons on a phone is making it any easier to port Android to other kinds of hardware. Secondly, there's the question of being cool or not. This is a matter of opinion and preference, but I mostly agree with Ron's assessment that virtual buttons look good. Samsung even unveiled a buttonless Tony Stark phone at CES last year, but you can obviously only buy one if you're a member of the Avengers. Image credit: IGN The final hardware argument for virtual navigation buttons is that they supposedly allow getting bigger screens onto smaller devices, which would result in smaller bezels and higher screen-to-body ratios. The idea is that the space that would have been taken up by physical buttons can now be used to extend the screen towards the bottom edge of the device, or instead to slim down the chin while maintaining the same screen size. The logic is sound in theory — in practice, however, it turns out to be nothing more than a pipe dream. Smaller bezels? Nope. Even if you were convinced that virtual navigation buttons led to smaller bezels, you'd be hard pressed to find an example of a phone with a noticeably thin bottom bezel due to having virtual buttons instead of physical ones. That's not to say they don't exist, but they're certainly not the norm. Take the Nexus 6P and the Nexus 5X, for example. They both have about the same bottom bezel size, measuring around 16.0 and 16.2 millimeters, respectively. But compare this to the 17.2 millimeters you'll find on an iPhone 6S (which sports a huge home button on the bottom of the device) and suddenly it's not clear where all that saved space went. The bottom bezel on a Nexus 5X is only about 1 millimeter shorter than the one of an iPhone 6S One of the most touted advantages of on-screen buttons is that they provide the best of both worlds: the navigation buttons are present when they're needed, but they can hide away when they're not (such as when watching a video) — freeing up valuable screen space. The assumption here is that on-screen buttons use up the space that would have otherwise been used for hardware buttons, so that in the worst case (i.e. when the on-screen buttons are visible), the amount of usable screen space is the same. In reality, what most often happens is that instead of increasing the screen height (or decreasing the bezel width), on-screen buttons take up what was previously free screen real estate, so that in the best case (when the nav buttons are hidden), you've got same available area. You could argue that in this example, part of the width of the bottom bezel is taken up by the front-facing speaker that's present on either Nexus, or that I'm just cherry-picking a particularly thick-bezeled phone to try to prove my point — after all, the previous generation's Nexus 6 had an impressively slender chin. We could quickly get into a back-and-forth citing of anecdotal examples and counterexamples that wouldn't lead us anywhere, so let's instead try to gather some real data and make more conclusive comparisons. Using data from PhoneArena, I compiled a list of over 50 smartphones that were released until the end of 2015 and that spanned multiple operating systems and form factors. The selection methodology was arguably the most hand-wavey part of the process, but care was taken to give special relevance to flagship models and popular phones, as well as to gather a balanced number of devices both with and without software buttons. Using 2x scaled images, I measured the width of the bottom bezel of each device, as well as the height of the nav bar for devices with virtual buttons, to an accuracy of around half a millimeter or less. The collected data is shown in the table below.

Comparison of bezel sizes on numerous different devices At a quick glance, it's clear that physical bezels are not much smaller for phones with software buttons. In fact, as soon as you factor in the space taken up by the navigation bar (the 'virtual bezel,' if you will), almost all those phones end up having a larger physical plus virtual bezel than even the widest bezel on a hardware-buttoned phone. Among phones with software buttons, HTC phones are probably the worst offenders: with so many bottom bars, they almost look like an inverted Internet Explorer window from the early 2000's. Doing the math, we find that the median bezel size for Android phones without navigation bars is 14.9mm, while the median for phones with navigation bars is actually more, at 15.4mm. Even splitting those up between phones with and without a bottom front-facing speaker gives a median of 15.8mm for the former and 15.0mm for the latter: if anything, phones with software buttons seem to have larger bezels than phones without. (Medians are arguably the most relevant statistic in this situation, but if averages are used instead, the values obtained are 15.3mm, 15.0mm, 15.6mm, and 14.3mm, respectively. According to these numbers, software buttons shave off a single millimeter from the bottom bezel, at best.)   Median (mm) Average (mm) Physical bezel for Android phones w/ hardware buttons 14.9 15.3 Physical bezel for Android phones w/ software buttons 15.4 15.0 Physical+virtual bezel for Android phones w/ software buttons 22.9 23.1 Physical bezel for Android phones w/ software buttons w/o bottom front-facing speaker 15.0 14.3 Physical bezel for Android phones w/ software buttons w/ bottom front-facing speaker 15.8 15.6 So why do we like software buttons again? In the end, there doesn't appear to be any evidence which suggests that virtual navigation buttons will make a phone's bezel any thinner. Tall bezels can't be chalked up to front-facing speakers either: on average, putting a bottom front-facing speaker on a phone only adds about a millimeter in bezel height. The Sony Xperia Z5 is proof that a bottom front-facing speaker doesn't need to take up too much space This conclusion is undeniably odd: it stands to reason that if phones don't need to account for the added space required by hardware buttons, their bezels should obviously be smaller. So why is this not the case? I'm no engineer, and I certainly don't have any experience in building smartphones, but one plausible explanation might be that the bottom bezel on a phone simply cannot be made any smaller than a certain limit before you start running into some serious manufacturing problems. Something similar happens with smartwatches: Motorola has previously stated that the 'flat tire' on the Moto 360 is there because of the space required to accommodate the display drivers. And even phones that are touted as "borderless" like the Sharp Aquos Crystal still sport a pretty sizable bottom bezel. Perhaps it's the display drivers, or maybe it's the USB port or headphone jack, but it feels like there's some barrier stopping us from reaching a bezel substantially under 10mm tall. The "borderless" Sharp Aquos Crystal, with 75% fewer bezels So why are most Android users such fans of software buttons then? There are a few very valid reasons why someone would prefer software buttons over hardware buttons, but wanting smaller bezels is clearly not one of them. And if phones will always require a thickish bezel anyway, why go to all the trouble of removing physical buttons if all we're going to achieve is reducing usable screen space? Whatever the case, it's clear there are advantages and disadvantages to both on-screen and hardware navigation buttons, and that it wouldn't hurt to have some more debate on the matter. It's certainly not true that Google is some perfect, infallible company, and just because it decides to do something a certain way doesn't mean it's necessarily the best one.

Hard ware buttons are better than software buttons, it feels better, no burn in, no accidental touches. Diego Opazo SV-Cross How do you plan to power on the device? Mark Curtis With the hardware button that's always been present?? iPhone_user1 I always suffered accidental touches with my old note 3. The capacitive buttons on Samsung devices are trash. Corey Watford At least on my Nexus devices, I use Pie Controls, really useful. Got them from using LMT Launcher or Gravity Mod. Liam Spradlin I think hiding the buttons behind a gesture would make the experience incredibly difficult for new/inexperienced users. Plus gestures like that are often an accessibility concern. brkshr Hiding the nav buttons creates an extra step to use buttons that I use hundreds of times a day. I tried to get on that bandwagon a couple of years ago, but it was just WAY too inefficient. SadAndroidGuy The fact that I can't enjoy playing games on my phone is enough for me to have the software buttons, it's distracting me, I always need to avoid it, while on the hardware buttons and capacitive if I accidentally touch it, it will prompt me if I really want to go back. Marcellus1 Haha, I'm the opposite. Most games hide the software buttons, which is awesome. When I had the Galaxy S3 I would often accidentally tap the capacitive button and be thrown out of my game or at least have it interrupted. SadAndroidGuy Except the best games, doesnt hide the software keys, like square enix games, rockstar, etc. Marcellus1 Just use an app to hide them if that is the case--like GMD Full Screen Immersive Mode. Doesn't need root and can hide capacitive buttons wherever you want. SadAndroidGuy I cant use the keyboard though :( Marcellus1 The keyboard does not work while navigation bar is hidden--just swipe to bring up the navigation bar and then use the keyboard. Hide the nav bar again when you're done. SadAndroidGuy I meant , I hate the software keys sorry. pfmiller "on the hardware buttons and capacitive if I accidentally touch it, it will prompt me if I really want to go back" No reason why on screen buttons couldn't do that too, but there are ways to hide the buttons entirely which is better. That the games don't implement that is the developers problem. Ronak Gandhi I felt it otherwise when I tried to use an S6 for few months. Pressing the home button felt like a chore compared to tapping the on-screen home button. I think in general tapping the screen is way faster than pressing a hardware button. Marcellus1 Try GMD Full Screen Immersive Mode. It works without root and will hide the software buttons wherever you want them hidden (e.g., just in one app, everywhere, etc.). Cory S I accidently touch the capacitive buttons on my samsung devices more than I ever did an OSB phone, which makes sense being you have a bezel between your palm and screen with OSB. TipTop This so much. I avoid the awful SW buttons like a plague. What a waste of screen space. Kyanos I am okay with the idea of on-screen buttons. HOWEVER, they are not good for AMOLED screens. They cause image retention or whatever the proper word for it is, and it's hard to not notice it once you know it's there. I would take physical or even touch sensitive buttons off the screen any day to combat that issue. iPhone_user1 No problems on my 6P..... Lman146 ..... which isn't even a year old yet.... Régis Knechtel Yes! I have a nasty screen burn in at the bottom of my 1st gen Moto X's screen since it had less then 6 months. This is the phone that made me start to hate on screen nav buttons. iPhone_user1 Old gen amoled panels did suffer that problem. However, I haven't heard many complaints about burn in problems recently for the newer gen amoled panels. Computator I have a Nexus 6, and I just recently started to notice some burn in. You can see a bar of shifted brightness where the nav bar is normally at when in full screen mode. Certain colors make it fairly obvious. rdeleonp That's old gen AMOLED. But I'm personally waiting to see how much better current gen AMOLED really is before considering anything else besides IPS. Grayson Go look at the Galaxy S7 (you know, the one that came out weeks ago) display models at Best Buy. They are already burned in. Granted, that's an extreme use case, but my point is that Samsung definitely haven't solved that problem. iPhone_user1 Same thing can be said about LCD phones having lighbleed issues on store models. Having a display on at 100% 24/7 is not good for any display. Grayson Really? Maybe on phones with crappy LCDs. I go into an Apple store and every display looks flawless, even on the phones that have been sitting out for a year. mr.fozzo Haptic buttons are ok to me, there just needs to be some consistency across Android so that it's always (from left to right, Back - Home - Multitask) iPhone_user1 Only Samsung still uses them. They need to drop them. AsterMK I prefer the inverted layout because I'm left handed and it's an easier motion to reach over to the right side. Why shouldn't all OEMs give us an option to choose by standard? iPhone_user1 I'm pretty sure LG let's you customise their position. I'd imagine Samsung would let you do the same if they implemented it. AsterMK And plenty of hardware button phones also let you do that by having unlabeled buttons (OnePlus and Xiaomi for example), so whichever way buttons are implemented it's doable, but for some reason the internet likes to hop on the OMG SAMSUNG BACKWARDS BUTTONS bandwagon too much. Granted, with software buttons it could be easier if it was even an option in stock Android and it sadly isn't. iPhone_user1 I think it's the idea that people want the Andoid experience to be consistent across all devices. Samsung is the only major OEM that has their navigation controls a different way. AsterMK Um, of the top 4 Android OEMs, Samsung has backwards order, Huawei lets you choose, Lenovo has backwards order and Xiaomi either lets you choose or has them backwards, dependent on the phone. It's far from consistent. Prepagan There's no objective 'correct' order or 'backwards' order - it all depends on what you are used to. But, as you rightly point out, the problem (such as it is) is the lack of consistency. Everyone adopting the option to choose would clearly be the ideal solution. I personally prefer off-screen capacitive buttons with the left-most being for menu options and multitasking. Đức Thành There are logical reasons that the Back button should be placed on the left side. In most languages, you write from left to right. Going back means to go left. The arrow pointing to the left is used most universally to indicate the "going back" behavior: The backspace key on virtually any keyboard, the undo button on most software that has it, the Enter/return key that returns you to the beginning of the line, etc. Heck even Samsung's own navigation Back button is a curved arrow pointing to the left side. Putting it on the right side is just illogical in the same way some Americans argue that putting the date order as Month-Date-Year is somehow more convenient and intuitive. AsterMK I mean, if the button is on the right, it still points to the left. That's how it is on my RN2. Back button on the left should be default, back button on the right should be an option. I don't see why it's been such a huge argument for years when there's a really simple solution Google (and some OEMs) have repeatedly ignored. Đức Thành Typing this on a RMN2 myself, and yes I still find it stupid. The only reason Xiaomi and many OEMs even put the back button on the right is because Samsung does it, and Samsung is popular enough that it matters to the market that they want to advertise and sell their devices to. I mean, that's probably not the only reason, but surely the only reason that *matters* when it comes to business. So unless Samsung changes something, I don't think those other OEMs would hesitate to keep following this kind of key arrangement. Too bad Samsung itself is too deep into their product image to do anything about it even if they wanted to (and I doubt they want to). What was probably a bad design decision since the days of Bada and prior just gets carried on. I agree wholeheartedly with the notion that the back key on the left should be the default and there should be an option to switch it to the left for those who want it (or are simply too used to it). However there lies another parallel problem that ultimately affects this one and should it not be solved, there can't be options either: Many OEMs, and funnily enough, even consumers who still prefer capacity touch buttons for the nav bar. Because it's the hardware instead of software like on-screen buttons, you can't just add an option and let people choose it the way LG does with their phones. I suppose you technical could (a la OnePlus phones) but unless the target market is a bunch of tech enthusiasts, you'd have to worry about user confusion because the hardware indicator cannot be changed to its function if the option to switch sides is turned on. In the end? The biggest problem is probably the way people are hard-wired to take up habits, sometimes illogical ones, only to be resistant to better changes later on. And that doesn't end there. Sometimes the illogical habit is so wide-spread that it even affects individuals who want to welcome the transition to that more logical habit. I mean, I tried to learn to type on Dvorak keyboard layout once (to improve typing speed, because we all know Qwerty was designed to be slow on purpose) but eventually gave up when I saw that everywhere I go people always use Qwerty. Or the fact that I have to get used to this back key on the right side of the RMN2, because there's nothing I can do about it. Welp. AsterMK I like the unlabeled dots/lines on the Mi 5/OnePlus 2 actually, they seem more symmetrical and arguably look nicer to me. I can see the confusion though. I'd still say that aside from software buttons, that's the next best solution. Anyways I'd like to see Xiaomi for example move to software buttons or gives the Redmi line the Mi 5 button layout, because red navigation keys are just jarring and ruin the design. Đức Thành Agreed, if OEMs don't want to replace the capacity buttons with software ones, at least a compromise should be made and options should be provided. Maybe more brands should follow OnePlus in that regard (well except for the physical home button/fingerprint sensor in the front – I personally think if fingerprint sensor is a must, putting it on the back like the Nexuses 5X and 6P is a much better placement). Prepagan And yet in the examples you provide, the back space key, the carriage return key, the enter key on keyboards are all placed on the right hand side. Đức Thành If you ever read anything about the logic behind the keys arrangement of the Qwerty keyboard you'd learn that it was actually designed to make typing as cumbersome as possible. Sounds stupid, yes, but that was how it was back in the days of the typewriter where people didn't want the typing speed to be too fast that it could break the machine; and now we simply got too used to it to change. One more argument could be made about the placement of those keys being on the right hand side of the keyboard is that it improves reachability for right-handed people, but the same argument about reachability doesn't really apply for portable devices like phones and tablets, which are often small enough that they could be (or at least intended to be) operated with one hand. So that part doesn't really matter. What my point was, and still is, is that left side = go back, so it's logical that the button to go back should be on the left. It should be obvious why the back arrow that's present in some hamburger menus in Android since Material Design was introduced is always on the left, as so is the back arrow in iOS's UI, or the "go back one page" button on ANY web broswer, or other apps and programs that house similar functionality, really. I'm baffled as to why you are even trying yo debate something this self-evident. Left = back, so back should logically be on the left. That's it. Prepagan Actually, I have read about the logic behind the qwerty arrangement and learned that it was designed to *speed up* typing by avoiding jams and that the key arrangement was consistently revised over time to increase typing efficiency. The idea that the arrangement was designed to slow typists down has surely been thoroughly debunked by now. But, as you point out "that part doesn't really matter" (not really sure why you brought it up). I'm fine with you finding the back button on the left hand side to be logical - I just don't happen to agree. I was brought up reading prose left to right and music left to right. When I get to the end of phrase of music and see a repeat sign I realise that I am being instructed to 'go back' and play again. Similarly in instructions and symbology when I get to the end of a row of instructions and see a left facing arrow, I interpret it as telling me to 'go back'. A left facing arrow at the left hand end of a row isn't, to my mind, telling me to go back, it is merely telling me to go left or to reveal something that appears on the left (such Google Now in the GNL or the app drawer in Smart Launcher for example). Left identifies to me the start. The idea of being told, at the start, to go back just seems odd to me - go back to where? I'm already at the start. I'm surprised you are *baffled* that I disagree that there is an 'objective' order as to where a back button should be placed and that I believe that one's concepts on 'correct' or 'backwards' are entirely subjective and related to what one has become used to. As for 'debating', I'm merely responding to your replies to me and sharing my viewpoint - would you rather I didn't do that? Đức Thành >not really sure why you brought it up Maybe you misunderstand. I brought it up to prove the point about left = go back, and mentioned nothing about the placements of those keys on the keyboard at all. The part that doesn't matter is the key arrangement on the keyboard, I thought I made it clear in my previous comment. Maybe I didn't do a good enough job clarifying, but good job misinterpreting even after I've repeated my point, and it's quite a simple point at that. >I believe that one's concepts on 'correct' or 'backwards' are entirely subjective and related to what one has become used to. That's the thing. People get used to things and find it hard to give those habits up. But just because people are used to it doesn't mean it isn't illogical. You agreed with the notion that left means to go back, yet still think the order is "entirely subjective", that's the weird part. I'm not arguing about subjectivity here, and I'm not saying there is an objectively correct order either, I'm just saying there is a logic behind putting the back key on the left and doing the opposite is illogical, that's all. It is the same thing with choosing either the imperial system or metric system for measurement units, I don't know about their subjectivity/objectivity (you could say that whatever you choose to use it's a subjective decision, supposing what other people use in your environment isn't a factor) but surely one of them just makes more sense than the other. >As for 'debating', I'm merely responding to your replies to me and sharing my viewpoint - would you rather I didn't do that? Good grief, now you're trying to turn this into a semantic argument of whether two parties putting forward opposing arguments in discussion of a particular subject counts as a "debate" or not? If missing points and being unreasonably dismissive are all that you're gonna do, yes, I'd rather you didn't do that. Prepagan This is getting silly. Your arguments regarding the positioning of the 'back' button are not based on logic as much as you seem to think. I've explained why I believe it is more logical (based on consistency with western cultural practices) to have a left facing arrow on the right hand side as a back button, which you've yet to address. You don't agree, fine, I'm not really that invested in what some stranger on the internet thinks but you seem determined to convince me that I am wrong. I don't appreciate you purposefully distorting my words, however, and I have certainly never suggested that I agree that "left means to go back". If anything, I have suggested that placement of anything on the left is more likely to indicate a starting point from whence it would be illogical to 'go back'. While your initial reply to me was interesting in as much as it prompted me to re-consider my own assumptions, you've now descended into a level of argument that is more accusatory in tone if not insulting and I've no desire to continue this discussion on that basis. Hopefully, whatever happens in the future involves users being able to map their own 'buttons' (be they on or off-screen) otherwise one substantial group of people may end up getting thrown under the bus because someone's idea of consistency was imposed way too late in the day. Đức Thành I'm really sorry if I somehow managed to offend you in any way, just know that I didn't mean for that to happen. Whether it was my fault or not, you sound a little mad, maybe you should calm down a bit before getting into a pointless heated argument. While you don't appreciate my "purposefully distorting your words", be aware that I don't appreciate your repeatedly missing the only point I've been trying to make, either, whether on purpose or not, so there's that. Let's call it fair game; and regarding the logic of the back button's position it's probably best to just agree to disagree and move on, because at least we both can agree that any argument past this point is pointless. Andrei D. Not only customize, but make it 4 or 5 too. And that's where you can really get a lot more bang for the real estate buck if you are so inclined. Jeff Beck This is why we should outlaw lefthandedness. /s YaKillaCJ OnePlus 2 allows the choice of which side you want multi-task or back. ThatBabyAintMine If anything, software buttons would fix that problem for left-handed people. RTL Android already switches the back button and multitask button. xdapao3 I MUCH prefer Samsung's layout (and no, I am not left handed). Software buttons, BTW, can also be very easily reconfigured (which alone is a killer feature which is practically ignored in this article...) so anyone with software buttons should be allowed to choose which buttons and in which order they want them. Many OEMs and many custom ROMs do that. Asiandude Because in asia things we read things from right to left. I guess an option to map the buttons would be a welcome feature Chris I use the back button infinitely more than multitask, so I always switch those two buttons with any on-screen phone. Not everyone wants the buttons in one way. That's the beauty of on-screen, I can put them where I want them. rick slick Exactly I'm right handed and I use the back button way more than the recent apps button, and I prefer it on the right. That's the way Android was during the early years until Google decided to muck it up. Samsung is doing it right with the back button on the right. Pun intended. Corey Watford As much as I LOVE On Screen buttons, with all the industry moving to Amoled, this is not good news for On Screen Buttons, even AP saw Burn in of the Nav buttons within a week on the 6P. Sadly like drinking and driving, Amoled and Nav Buttons dont mix. Dominic81 I'm not a fan. I have a Z5 at the moment, and I miss the old capacitive buttons of my OnePlus One and Note 3. On-screen buttons are a waste of screen estate Gerret Walczak I've never understood this: "On-screen buttons are a waste of screen estate" You lose that real estate with a physical button because the button has to go somewhere. Or you can have it be an onscreen button which recaptures that screen real estate in most apps and reappears only when it's needed. Ádám Zovits Did you read that part of the article where it is shown that on-screen buttons don't free up any meaningful amount of screen estate? Dominic81 As far as I'm concerned, even if the on-screen buttons bar is 80px tall on a 1080p display, it's still 80x1080 pixels that are wasted and could be used to display more useful informations than a static bar with 3 buttons ;) That's why I'm not a fan of on-screen buttons. They use screen estate that could be used to display something more useful (more lines of text, a bigger portion on an image, etc.) Adil Tajgeer i think the argument here is for the most part, you aren't regaining any of that screen real estate (in a screen:phone ratio sense) by having an on screen button, OEMs aren't shrinking bezels down by much if at all be dropping the capacitive keys. you aren't getting a bigger screen in the same size package as a phone with capacitive buttons, you're getting the same size phone with less screen. (even with the buttons hidden) Dominic81 No, the phone that uses on-screen button doesn't have a taller screen, compares to a phone that uses hardware buttons. If you compare the Z5 (on-screen button) and the OnePlus One (capacitive buttons) for example: Both phones use a 1920x1080 display, but the OnePlus can use the full 1920x1080 pixels to display the app. On the other hand, the Z5 has to use some screen estate to display the on-screen buttons. If the on-screen buttons bar is 80px for example they won't use a 2000x1080 display on phones that use on-screen buttons, they will still use a 1920x1080 display. Lman146 That's not really true anymore. My Moto X Pure and the Galaxy Note 5 are almost the same exact size, but the Note 5 has more available screen real estate at all times because buttons are off screen. I think this may have been true 5 years ago but things have changed. brkshr Check out the bottom bezel on the Nexus 6. There is no room for capacitive/hardware buttons. The top even has a smaller bezel than most other manufacturers have for top or bottom bezels. That is how every Android device should look. Ender Ceylan Exactly. That's such a huge oversight, Dude conveniently ignored that phone in his argumentation. Martim It's *right there* in the graph. The Note 3 has a bezel that's just half a millimeter wider than the Nexus 6. minidev That's a bad example : the note 3 does NOT have a front facing bottom speaker. Also «The Sony Xperia Z5 is proof that a bottom front-facing speaker doesn't need to take up too much space» is a fallacious argument : I doubt the speaker behind the speaker grill is only 1 mm… I suppose having a reasonable bezel size with hardware buttons AND a bottom front facing speaker is challenging … MJ I agree with you on the bottom bezel of the N6 but the phone itself is to bulky for 99% of population. brkshr No argument there. I personally love the size of my N6, but I understand that it is way too big for a lot of others. I would probably be willing to go down to a 5.7" screen size for the decreased width, but the top and bottom bezels on the N6P are crazy huge in comparison to the N6. MJ Yes, but the N6P is thinner which I think is more important to comfortably hold. I have hands bigger then 99% of the population and hated just holding my co-workers N6 for two minutes. It felt like a square block to me. I am looking forward to the rumored 5.5" Nexus phone from HTC. Juan S. Camargo Visbal I keep believing the problem with the N6 wasn't the size but ergonomics. The Huawei Mate 7/8 also have 6" screens but are far easier to hold. The N6 carried the design of Motorola's other products, so the weight and shape distribution was bigger at the top, and the phone was rounder on the back. That made the phone unwieldy, even if the smaller siblings are super-ergonomic. I LOVE big phone and I kept dreading I would drop the N6 whenever I held one. Almost bought many times on discount but couldn't live with that fear. My Dixie Wrecked I'm proud to be a member of the 1%. Defenestratus I'm waiting on a replacement screen for my N6 so I can rejoin your ranks. I freakin hate my 6P. TOO SMALL GOOGLE ... ITS TOO SMALL. iPhone_user1 It really isn't small at all. I doubt 0.3 inches is a huge difference. Nick V It's wider than the 6p for sure though. I love my 6p My Dixie Wrecked Stay strong, brother! Thurman Merman Ok, any other recent Motorola phone then? They're all like that. Tiny bottom bezels. (I am not a fanboy, just a keen observer.) cvm The Moto x 2014 has really small bottom bezel. Martim The Nexus 6 is also the second smallest device with on-screen buttons I found. Even then, most flagship Samsung phones have an almost identical bezel height, and they don't have any problem sticking two capacitive buttons and a hardware button (with a fingerprint sensor, no less) in there. Take a look at the bar graph for some other sizes. brkshr I checked it out. I'm just saying that it is possible for Android manufacturers to make the bezels small enough to where capacitive/hardware buttons are not possible. Making software buttons necessary. I was actually surprised that LG and Huawei managed to make the bezels much bigger than the previous years Nexus. Felt like a step backwards IMO. Martim I intuitively also feel that on-screen buttons *should* result in thinner bezels, but there isn't any real evidence of that. I don't know if it's OEM laziness or some hidden barrier that's stopping bezels from being thinner than a certain limit (my guess might be something related to the space required by the USB port), but the fact is that bezels are hardly ever thinner than 10mm, with or without on-screen buttons. brkshr Agreed My name is…. Just sold my Nexus 6. Typing was so difficult on that device, because of the small bezels. Many times tapped on 'b' key instead of space. vwnut13 Motorola knows what they are doing with bottom bezels. YouNex Check out the Moto X with it's 100mm bottom bezel :D Qbancelli So someone writes an article trying to convince us that on-screen software buttons are really no better than hardware buttons? Now I have heard everything. Either a fanboy, or Samsung's money at work. iPhone_user1 OMG someone has a different opinion to you. Definitely a fanboy... smh Lman146 Lol really? I am a fan of on screen buttons but have used both hardware and software nav keys, and this article didn't seemed biased or "paid for" at all. He raises some valid points. I was just noticing how much bigger my dad's Note 3's screen seems next to my Moto X Pure and realized it is mainly because of the software keys. rick slick You are a silly boy. Hardware buttons are way better than stupid on-screen buttons. Are you needing a little help in the common sense department? dexgen One main advantage of on screen buttons for me is the amount of thumb travel needed to hit the home/back buttons. If you have hardware buttons with the same amount of bezel the thumb travel is a lot more and it becomes that much harder to use it one handed! Steve Edson With hardware buttons, it wouldn't be possible to have the old Google Now swipe up gestures (which I really miss in Lollipop). Also, Google can freely change how the buttons behave in new updates (ie switching to the last app in Android N). It would be a lot harder to do this when the hardware varies so much per phone. E.g. Stiff buttons == hard to double click etc. Martim Phones with hardware buttons have (or had, I guess?) other ways of bringing up Google Now. I'm not sure one way is better than the other, it's more a question of habit. Steve Edson Yeah I'm not saying its impossible, I'm just saying that by having software buttons, it gives Google more choice. For example, Google could reintroduce a virtual search button overnight, like the old devices, without having to worry about the hardware button missing. meyerweb Coulda, woulda, shoulda. The fact is that Google doesn't, and hasn't, implemented any capabilities that rely on soft buttons. Adil Tajgeer being that Now on tap is a long press, the effect of holding down a home button either capacitive or physical is basically the same action. personally i like both for different reasons, but my biggest gripe (since bezel size has remained fairly large aside from a few outliers) for capacitive buttons has been hitting them by accident when playing a game. with samsung allowing you to lock the buttons when playing a game now, i'm more or less fine with either or. Daniel Edin This is the biggest advantage. When watching youtube (or gaming) I can hold my phone however the f*ck I want without somehow possibly missclicking since they are not even visible. I imagine software buttons could advance a lot with "force touch" displays. Adil Tajgeer i do think software buttons are still the future once, especially once we can do fingerprint reading through the screen and i def think pressure sensitive displays will make them more useful, for their current implementation though, i can really go either way. mx3 For the record, the HTC One M7 had a swipe up to go to Google Now, and it had capacitative buttons. vwnut13 I had an LG with physical buttons where swiping up from off the bottom of the screen brought up that menu. Mr Mop Droid Turbo had swipe-up for Google Now with capacitive keys Steve Edson Yeah like I said in a different reply, I'm not saying its impossible, its just by having software buttons, it gives Google more choice. E.g reintroducing a virtual search button overnight if they wanted to. rmkilc On-screen buttons are future proof. Hardware manufacturers just haven't put enough focus on making top and bottom bezels smaller. Martim Whether it's lack of focus from OEMs or manufacturing difficulties, the fact is that on-screen buttons haven't led to any appreciable reduction in bezel size. And without shrinking down those bezels, on-screen buttons are just taking up screen real estate. BoFiS I still prefer on-screen buttons so I can customize them and add in a permanent menu button on the right side, or be able to see when the back arrow becomes a down arrow to close a keyboard, etc. Christian Trevor Clauss Screen burn-in from the navigation buttons is the only reason why I hate on-screen nav buttons. My old 2014 Moto X and current Nexus 6 fall to this and it's irritating to see it every time I put the phone in landscape. Other than that, I love it. Noeltorious Yup, two phones I've noticed it on are my crappy old GNex (real bad!) but also my current Nexus 6 >.> Slowpoke It is because of the AMOLED screen. Fatal1ty_93_RUS Nexus 4 user here for almost 3 years - no screen burn-in present. Get a phone that doesn't have a shitty display = problem solved sennarose88 Um... Nexus 4 doesn't have AMOLED display, of course it won't burn in. More phone will have AMOLED in the future though so it will be more of an issue. Fatal1ty_93_RUS I sure hope they won't. AMOLED looks like somebody forgot to tune down the contrast setting from 100 to 50 rick slick LOL you got pwned. Fatal1ty_93_RUS >pwned Are you 12? David VanHouse This is why i immediately rooted/rom'd my Nexus 6P i got a few days ago so i can force immersive mode and use PIE controls. The last thing i want is to even have a hint of burn-in, it would drive me crazy. Owen Finn Or you can be like the OnePlus One and have the option of either? OneTime I'm using the on-screen buttons, looks much better and easier to reach Prepagan And I've turned off the on-screen buttons on mine and rely on the hardware buttons - I think it looks much better and don't have any problems with reach. Just as well OnePlus gave us the choice. AsterMK I'd say that on screen buttons are better in a way because if Google ever decides to change the navbar's layout, the softkeys will be able to change but hardware keys wouldn't. (I think Steve Jobs said it at the OG iPhone launch event) Still, a lot of salty Nexus warriors that can't accept others' opinions are incoming. MJ On-screen buttons ftw! Why do I want ugly physical buttons cluttering the front of my phone again? Worse, why would I want to move my finger off my touch screen to press a button? Yes, they take up a little screen space (when an app is not full screen) but a good trade-off for a display 4.5" and larger. crandrix I think I rather have software buttons or haptic, just don't put any kind of physical button on the front panel (not even a fingerprint scanner.) Liam Spradlin Personally I think that software nav has inherent benefits over hardware nav if only for their possibilities, even if they aren't fully realized. The fact that they _could_ show more information in more cases than they currently do is a material fact that doesn't apply to hardware buttons. The buttons do always anchor around a consistent center point physically as you rotate the phone - I don't count it as a knock against the nav bar that apps don't always follow that lead. That responsibility belongs to developers. As for bezels, I'm probably an outlier in that I'm not really concerned with how tiny we can get the bezels. In the end I don't necessarily believe that the rationale behind software nav - from Google/Android's perspective - aligns with Ron's post from 4+ years ago when the feature was first introduced, so I don't know if it's fair to use counters to those points to say that software nav actually isn't better than any other alternative. I think there are two different perspectives there, and probably a third one now that we're so far out from their introduction. Juan S. Camargo Visbal I have a Samsung and an iPad and I must admit, I prefer either on-screen buttons, or multiple capacitive keys (back-home-recents). iOS' way of going back or multitasking is weird, and I always dread I'm going to break the main button. EDIT: Almost forgot, the visual feedback of on-screen keys trumps the capacitive keys in my experience. Liam Spradlin My issue with iOS' system-wide "back" navigation is that it takes over the status bar. So you have tiny touch targets for system-level nav, AND your status info is sacrificed to this mechanism. The only thing left behind is the clock in the center. Juan S. Camargo Visbal Not only that, it's in the topmost right corner, making it incredibly uncomfortable to hit. Martim There are certainly other reasons why someone would prefer on-screen buttons over hardware ones — the list is by no means exhaustive. These arguments are perhaps the ones that are most commonly tossed around and therefore the ones I focused on. Until a couple of months ago, I was also pretty much convinced that phones with on-screen buttons really did have smaller bezels. It makes sense that they would, but if you start to actually compare bezel sizes then you find that that isn't really true at all. At that point, you've got something which in the *best* case gives you as much screen space as if you had a phone with hardware buttons to start with, while at the same time hiding the three most important navigation buttons on the device. For all the potential on-screen buttons might hold, if that doesn't ever materialize into any concrete benefits, then what good does that actually do anyone? Xyriin I think the 'virtual' bezel is kind of a moot point. I mean, whenever you're in an app that would really benefit from the extra screen space the software nav slides away for more room anyway. Similarly, with a transparent software nav you can see scrolling content through the buttons for apps like Twitter, chat, browsers, etc. Again, something you can't do with a hardware button. Then there is the extra benefit of customization, less components for hardware failure, and more navigation options if programmed in. I think the best word for software nav is versatility. Imagine a point in the future where you check a box in the settings for persistent software nav, hidden software nav, or auto software nav. Another analysis that might be beneficial...instead of bezel sizes what about actual screen size in devices with/without hardware buttons. Sometimes you gain more there because OEMs like their design to be uniform. A small savings on the bottom is seen on the top as well which results in better ratio savings of screen vs. frame. My1 well even hw buttons can be made to be customized. (even if you cannot really change the number of the available buttons you could disable them) but the problem is if you hide the navbar then you always have to swipe the navbar back just so you can get the most important measure of navigation back. if phones with navbar had no (or close to no) screen border at the bottom then it might make sense but that isnt the case. well the point of hw failure is true but I never had this, and I dont know how many people had a killed touchscreen in comparison to kiled navbar buttons. also the hw buttons dont need to be transparent because at the place where there are the hw buttons normally there is just border on the with-navbar devices. Tobias Klevenz For focussing so much on the lack of implemented benefits of software nav your article says little about actual benefits of hardware nav... I personally think software nav is way more elegant, simply because everything is done on screen. Why have hardware buttons if there isn't any need to have them? Why should an OEM spend time developing those components? meyerweb Because there are functional benefits to hardware buttons? Tobias Klevenz Which are? meyerweb I think they've been explained already, but to repeat a couple: They don't take up space that the app could be using. They don't need to be swiped in and out--they're always available. They don't change location depending on the app--they're always in the same place. pdimitar As if you actually gave an actual argument. Don't call out people on not giving arguments when you're a part of the same problem. And that's separately from the fact that the author actually gave arguments. Why so biased and one-sided? "Elegant" isn't a fact, it's a subjective opinion. There is no "need" of hardware buttons except for the very obvious fact that they (1) don't get in the way in the app and (2) don't need a tap on the screen to be even available. leganzish I am 100% in agreement with you Liam. I like software buttons. I don't necessarily have a reason. I'm not focused on minimizing bezel (especially on a tablet). I guess I've liked them since their implementations, and nothing about their negatives bothers me. I adjust. The same can probably be said about hardware ones though. dcdttu He forgot to mention that large bezel on the 6P has dual speakers in it, unlike the iPhone, Samsung, whatever. My1 well ebven if the bezel has speakers, the bezel of the samsung phones is occupied and on iphones at least the center of it is occupied. and people like me who run around with headphones all day instead of annoying people with a smartphone-shaped ghettoblaster dont need dual speakers. dcdttu While not responsible for what other people do on their phone in public, I personally like the dual front speakers on my 6P. I'm hard of hearing, so it helps when I want to hear something at home. pdimitar That's very understandable and I sympathize. I like dual front-facing speakers as well but having in mind how much the OEMs are unwilling to produce such phones, I eventually swallowed it. As the author pointed out however, the Sony devices are a really good example of the fact that you can have dual front-facing speakers without that getting in the way of having a space for hardware buttons. They simply chose not to put them there. (Might be wrong on that last point, I am clueless as to how are smartphones assembled.) Azortje "software nav has inherent benefits over hardware nav if only for their possibilities, even if they aren't fully realized." Exactly! The fact that manufacturers decide to not make the bezels substantially thinner on the bottom doesn't mean it didn't save up space. The Moto X 2014 wouldn't have been possible with a hardware button. It doesn't have the space and would need to forgo its bottom front facing speaker. Just because some average or mean of the population doesn't show substantial difference doesn't mean there aren't a lot of designs that wouldn't have been possible otherwise. The buttonless bottom gives a lot more options in motherboard layout, like the Aquos for example. My1 well I personally like hw buttons more, because especially when the navbar vanishes on normal devices, you have to pull it back to use it. on hw button'ed phones this problem doesnt exist, also the bezel doesnt just seem to be smaller, BUT the bottom bezel is USED, making the usable space ratio quite a bit higher than with sw buttons. okay sw buttons can be customized better but if you use generic symbols on sw buttons (I saw devices which just have dots on the sensor buttons) you can also swap them as you like withou any nightmares. in fact on my Note 4 I have disabled button lighting which has the side-effect of making their icons invisible and I remapped the recent apps button back to the menu button, because I like that more. Alessandro in fact, i really don't understand thy android decided to put the recent app button instead of the MORE USABLE menu/option button. i notice a lot of apps need to press on display the 3 small dots, in order to open the SETTINGS.... but on big displays it's a nightmare to arrive on it with my thumb!! it is easier to have a front hardware button to open the menu/settings of each app.... just like you did, remapping the button. for recent app button imho the best option is always a long tap on CENTRAL key ( generally a button on some devices like samsung, or the classic circle) Maxr1998 I believe the most important advantage for software buttons is that the screen/bezel is nearly always symmetrical without hardware buttons. And many people (like me) like symmetry. I especially appreciate it when I hold my N6P in landscape mode. Noel Affonso My Galaxy Note 4 is perfectly symmetrical, even with hardware buttons. Maxr1998 Size wise, yes. So is the S7Edge. But the buttons make the device look less clean and asymmetrical imo. There are pros and cons for both.. Mostly depends on preference. But you can't say "XY is better". OrionBeast WHATDAFUNK! Why didn't you put the chart BEFORE the list. i went through the entire list. #scrublife (PS well written post!) <3 My1 but the navbar can also be swiped away when you for example have locked to vertical as launcher and then you have a movie player which obviously locks to horizontal and you go out of the movie the bar always goes away because on my device (Galaxy tab 2 7.0 wifi) the bar is always at the bottom of the content, not the physical bottom of the device. when then for example hitting back multiple times, you get one hit on back, a rotation, and the rest of the touches hit whatever is there after the rotation, seriosuly annoying an a problem I dont have on my Note 4 also about the part that it "could" show more stuff, why did they then move the menu button out of the navbar into the action bar where is is hard to reach and taking unneeded space? I modded my Note 4 in a way that the keys again work like on the Note 3 meaning menu button is here once again and recents becomes long home again. Turning off the key lighting (which is bad for the battery anyway) and no annoying symbols. Todd Thanks for writing this article. I've long been one of the few that hasn't really embraced the on-screen button fervor, and I say this as someone that currently uses an N5 and my prior phone was an OG. The inconsistency is maddening. pallzoltan What's an OG? Todd Sorry, LG Optimus G, or LGOG for short. I forgot to put in the first part. Marcell Lévai I feel you. I've had a Samsung Galaxy S (hardware buttons), Oneplus One (which could switch between hardware and software buttons) and now a Sony Z3 (software buttons). Of the three, I preferred the Oneplus implementation, second the Galaxy and then the Z3. I don't even agree, that Samsung's "backwards buttons" are an issue. I use the back buttons a lot more then the task switcher, so I want to access it more easily. Which happens with Samsung's implementation, as my thumb doesn't have to reach as far. On my Galaxy S I used to use Cyanogenmod, which let me customize what happens when I short/long press the buttons. It was awesome. rick slick Exactly - I prefer Samsung's button orientation. Wes C >Take the Nexus 6P and the Nexus 5X, for example. They both have about the same bottom bezel size, measuring around 16.0 and 16.2 millimeters, respectively. But compare this to the 17.2 millimeters you'll find on an iPhone 6S (which sports a huge home button on the bottom of the device) and suddenly it's not clear where all that saved space went. Of course it's clear where the space went: to the front-facing second speaker. matteventu Probably you missed the paragraph where he talks about Nexus 6 speakers. The6Big9Lebowski42 That is one of the widest phones. A better metric would have been the screen to body surface area ratio. hunter2 The problem with screen to body ratios is that the internal components are mostly the same absolute size. That means as the screen grows you have more space to play with. The6Big9Lebowski42 That's not really a problem; it's physics. The same phenomenon is causing the Nexus 6's bezel size to seem small compared to other on-screen nav and front facing speaker'd phones. I still think that ratio is a more appropriate way to compare these phones. Maybe not for this article's purpose, but to be fair, I think this article is silly. hunter2 It's a problem when you're using it as a metric for how good an OEM did with phone design. Like you said, it's physics, there's only so much someone can do. So when you come up with a number that is supposed to represent a good ratio, the smaller phones will always come off looking worse (or will need to put in a lot more effort) The6Big9Lebowski42 I mean, why would you compare the numbers directly without context, in either case..? It's only a problem if you are a person who, instead of interpreting the data, just relies on the very simplistic reasoning of "the bigger the number, or the smaller the number the better, fullstop" or on the idea that there is a number for all phones that is a "good ratio" and ignores any nuance. And again, since you didn't seem to listen the first time: this "problem" of physics made itself apparent in just comparing the bezel sizes as well. That's what this particular thread of comments was talking about; they think that the Nexus 6 proves that on-screen nav buttons save space, but when, in reality, it's just a large phone. I think that screen to body ratio is the best way to compare the usable surfaces of a phone, and that this whole contrived argument about on or of screen buttons done by refuting a four year old article is really silly. Andrew Gallagher The Nexus 6 and Moto X disagree. The two smallest bottom bezels in the list, and both have a front facing speaker there. someone755 I've been a fan of software buttons since my first tablet. Launched with 1.6, updated to 2.2, with software buttons the entire time. They weren't useful or anything since it was just some proprietary implementation and it was the age of Froyo, but regardless it made me favor software buttons. Duder Google don't read this article. GAMERFORANDY I paid for 5.0 inch phone but in real life its only 4.8! DAMN SOFTWARE BUTTONS. I CANT PLAY GAMES PROPERLY BECAUSE ITS BLOCKING THE DAMN WAY! MJ Yes, your phone is to small... I wouldn't play games on a phone smaller than 5.5" with on-screen buttons or not if you paid me. Marcellus1 Do the buttons not autohide in games for you? They do on my Nexus 6. If they don't, however, there are options like GMD Full Screen Immersive Mode that can hide them for you. GAMERANDY I CANT USE THE KEYBOARD! WHEN USING THOSE APPS Kyle Gospodnetich You might need to go back to school. Marcellus1 Swipe to bring up the nav bar when you want to use the keyboard. Hide it again when done. Noeltorious This guy is NOT happy drcaveman On my Nexus 6P lots of games especially older ones have failed to implement immersive mode. I've even recently played a few games where it takes the developer months to implement immersive mode, plus chrome does not have immersive mode Marcellus1 So use the app I suggested or something else similar to hide the nav bar yourself. No need to wait for developers to implement immersive mode. RIsoldier Thank You! This is directly a problem with the app devs not implementing it properly, and not the buttons themselves. rick slick GMD Full Screen Immersive causes strange behaviors with on-screen keyboards and other annoyances. It's not a good solution. I stopped using it on my devices because of those annoyances getting in the way of usage. philosopher_Mk Reason why software buttons are way better, they can be moved according to orientation. Ibrahim Yusuf Care to explain? Kyle Gospodnetich If you flip and ipad in landscape mode, it's buttons will be on the left or right side, and top or bottom if you flip it in portrait mode. On Android, the buttons are always on the right side in landscape, and always on the bottom in portrait. TheSpaceUnicorn What's wrong with the home button being on the right side? philosopher_Mk It's bad ux, because button doesn't move as content change orientation. It's harder to reach because nav bar is always at the bottom. TheSpaceUnicorn I'm not seeing how it's bad UX for the home button to always be exactly where you expect it to be. drcaveman Agreed philosopher_Mk It's not where you expecting to be. When device is in portrait is below navigation bar, below keyboard , below content. When it's rotated it's on the right side of the content. When you rotate your tablet do you expect browser tabs to be on the top or on the side ? TheSpaceUnicorn The button literally never moves, so how could it possibly ever be somewhere you don't expect it to be? "When you rotate your tablet do you expect browser tabs to be on the top or on the side ?" The problem with that comparison is that you're treating on screen content and a physical home button as if they're the same thing, when they aren't even close. philosopher_Mk "The problem with that comparison is that you're treating on screen content and a physical home button as if they're the same thing, when they aren't even close." - Well that's the article right ? Comparing software with physical button? We are comparing buttons, and you just write the biggest downside of physical buttons, they don't feel like they are part of the app,they feel like completely different thing . Remember,we are talking about touchscreen device ux. TheSpaceUnicorn I'm just saying that between on-screen and physical neither one is worse UX, they're both equal they just go about it in different ways. Physical buttons are always where you expect them to be because they literally never move from the bottom of the device. Meanwhile (only on tablets) on-screen buttons are always on the bottom of the content. Neither is somehow worse than the other, they're just different. drcaveman On Android they move all over the place and differently per app, with fixed buttons I always know exactly where the button is. person On a tablet, they're always on the bottom. Damian Kuciński That's way too funny :D They remove buttons and make'em virtual. Why? To save some space, right? Well, no. They do this for no reason. Ive used phones with virtual buttons and with out-of-screen ones and in fact, second option is the better option. Virtual ones don't work well, and have no real advantage. Rod They have the advantage of not needing to be replaced. Damian Kuciński What do you mean? Buttons under screen don't need that but onscreen buttons are being replaced pretty often by apps etc. Rod I love virtual buttons. They don't break. Most of the iPhones I see have that assistive touch enabled. Once I asked, and the owner said she never used the home button, to preserve it. ( ^_^) The Iphones Home Button is easy to broke I dunno why, My Samsung phones after years of using it never worn out. rick slick Exactly this. TheSpaceUnicorn I've never seen an iPhone user actually use assistive touch, nor have I heard of the home button breaking for anyone. Adil Tajgeer it's def a thing (home button breaking) but i don't think it's as widespread as stated. i think it has to do with a combination of the home button on ios being used for so many common actions (ie no way to back out of an app, pre 6s no way to jump between apps, etc) and a lot of iphone users being heavy handed with the mashing of the button. TheSpaceUnicorn I know it's a thing and it happens. I was just countering his anecdotal, but possibly true, statement with my equally anecdotal, but definitely true, statement to show how stupid an argument based on anecdotal evidence is. Adil Tajgeer hahah, personally i 1. didn't know asistive touch was a thing and 2. know absolutely zero people who use it. but i agree, without some kind of numbers to back it up, a claim is mostly worthless to base an argument on. Rod My 2 bosses used Assistive touch, as does my sister. Let alone the people I'm don't run into often. And I've suggested a place for a handful of people, that replaces the home button, Đức Thành You should come to Asia sometime. iOS users can't live without assistive touch there. Yes, it's ridiculous. Poodz I think this was the only point the author missed, repairability. There's less to go wrong. And even though the other comments say your argument is "stupid" I have seen at least 3 of my friends with iPhones use the assistive touch thing for this exact reason. So sure it's not everyone, but those people were doing it for prevention because broken buttons is a known issue. vwnut13 My cousin uses it one her iPhone. I had no idea why, but I know she's quirky like that. But now I remembered that she had an iPod touch that had a broken home button. rick slick broken iPhone home buttons may be an issue. Never had an issue with Samsung capaitive buttons or home buttons. HR It's interesting, since it's probably the easiest thing to replace on an iPhone. vwnut13 Just don't update your software... Sashank Narayan THIS. I've seen too many people with that floating button enabled. Somehow such "tips" spread like wildfire. I've had to convince quite a few of my friends about the durability of the home button during the life of the device, and as to why there's no point having a button if you don't use the damn thing. rick slick Seen plenty of virtual buttons burn into AMOLED screens. I love hardware buttons - they never break either, and I don't lose on-screen real estate. Rod Not the biggest fan of AMOLED myself. Roh_Mish I like software buttons because with then i have a good hazel to hold the phone from on either sides. In fact after i installed custom rom on my mi3, the first thing i did was to enable the button.also maybe because it's what i have gotten used to. David VanHouse Forgot the worst thing about on screen buttons, the potential for burn in on AMOLED displays Martim That's a very good point, but it's something that only affects a comparatively small portion of devices. On top of that, OLED technology is improving at a pace which might make that a non-issue in a couple of years. David VanHouse Well im not sure about your data stats, but all my AMOLED devices have suffered burn-in and so have my friends. Lots of people dont even notice cuz they are just like that...kinda like how my wife claims she cant see the difference between HD and SD Tv stations...yes crazy lol. portalpirate I'm someone who would notice burn in, and have only ever seen it on display models in carrier stores despite owning multiple phones with AMOLED screens. Anecdotal evidence is completely worthless. Sashank Narayan I've had it on both the Nexus 6's I've owned (had to RMA one for other reasons). On my current Nexus 6, it's actually quite prominent on light backgrounds. Burn-in definitely does happen, but I've come to realise that it's not *that* big a deal as most people make of it. Yes, I would prefer if it didn't happen, but it doesn't bother me too much during usual device usage. I don't get the feeling of "once seen, can't unsee". VAVA Mk2 You can clean burn in by inverting colors for 30 min and turning screen sleep time to 30 min. Merkwürdigliebe I kinda like the shutter button on the bottom of the phone. Lets me choose whichever hand is more convenient to press it. Madis Otenurm I never liked either, gestures (or pie/radial) all the way. Both button types waste screen or hardware space, aren't as convenient as could and even make the device uglier. Ibrahim Yusuf Even if the speakers look thin from the outside, that doesn't mean they are thin and small from the inside. In the example you showed (Xperia Z5), the speakers just looks thin. From the inside the bottom speaker is as long as from the bottom of the phone to the bottom of the screen, and as thick as the phone itself. Pessimippopotamus On principle, software buttons should be more flexible, but they're not. You can see vestiges of such ideas such as the back button's orientation changing when the keyboard is on the screen. But otherwise it doesn't do much that hardware buttons don't. Part of the problem is that the nav bar always has to remain visually consistent to not confuse users, even though it can do so much more. I'm not quite sure what would be a happy middle ground. On the otherhand, software buttons, I reckon, would make it easier for manufacturers to design phones. There's no additional hardware necessary for these buttons since they're already a part of the phone's primary touchscreen mechanism. As for the loss of usable screen size, I don't really care. 90% of immersive apps like games or video apps automatically hide buttons until they're swiped out, so it's no deal. No accidental button press like some phones with hardwares. And for reading apps, it's a sentence or two at most lost to the buttons, which is also similarly not a big deal to me. Also, I realized that I fumble around with phones with buttons at the bottom bezel because it's awkward for me to move my thumbs that far down on the phone. It's a personal thing. I just need some bezel on the bottom, which works best with the way I hold my phone, with the corner of the phone digging into the center of my palm. Ahmad Nadeem I'm generally fine with both kinds of buttons. But a hardware button should be well made IMO and not crappy ones with no backlight (Some Xioami phones) or maybe different orientation than the standard(*cough* Samsung *cough*). Virtual buttons can actually provide more flexibility in terms of modification, namely gestures. I currently use a 3 target navigation bar ring which allows me to swipe left to put the phone to sleep and right to reboot the phone, the centre one being the default Google now shortcut. It is a matter of convenience, some people will be more comfortable with virtual buttons, some with hardware buttons. No one can please them all. rick slick Samsung button orientation is superior to current stock android button layout. When Android was in its early days almost all phones had the back button on the right and it was super easy to use. I hate the current orientation of Android buttons where the back button is on left.. makes no sense. sproc I don't think the camera app's placement of the shutter button at the top when upside down is a mistake - that's probably because the sensor is at the bottom and thus wants you to avoid having your hand there. ASYOUTHIA On screen keys for the simple fact that they can be remapped and they hide when you're watching a movie or YouTube drcaveman My Note 5 has a smaller bezel than my Nexus 6P, and the buttons never interfere with what's on the screen, plus the backlight turns off when watching movies so they are equally if not more hidden. ASYOUTHIA You can still see the assbackwards button layout of Sammy and you can't remap them. I can also change the icon to whatever I want. It doesn't have to be the rectangle, circle and square Sir_Brizz The Nexus 6 had a much smaller bezel. There are practical reasons to having the larger bezel which is why it was designed this way I'm sure. The 6 was hard to hold without touching the screen. Not much of a problem on the 6P. BrendonLG lg on screen navigation>>>>>>>>>>>stock boring buttons>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>sambug,crapple hardware button Daniel Tiberius I like on screen nav buttons cause they're neato. Pessimippopotamus I never noticed that orientation issue with the Google Camera app because I always use the volume key to take pictures. I bet you that it's like that because they don't want you to accidentally cover up your lens with the hand that has to press the shutter button, so it's always at the bottom of the device, away from the top where manufacturers typically position the camera unit. Defenestratus Having to go between my Nexus phones and my samsung tablet, I cannot stand having to use the physical buttons on the tablet. The home button itself drives me nuts in its Apple-esqueness. Luca Same here, also I hate that back and multitasking buttons are switched! rick slick You are not a long time Android user it seems. On the early days of Android the back button was on the right and that's how it should be. Funny to see how newbies think the current orientation is the right orientation. You have no idea. Luca I never said it is the "right" thing to do but I am used since at least 4 years with the current "official" disposition. It is funny tough that you think that the first orientation is the right one but I shall not think the same thing about the current one, oh well, I guess we newbies are dumb and can't express our thought. drcaveman I have to say it, the Note 5 Bottom Bezel is 11.5mm much smaller than the button less Nexus 6P. After using a Nexus phone for years and switching to the Note 5, I have to say I can't stand on screen button anymore. They are always taking away from the immersive experience. It took me only three days to get used to the backward controls. NERV That's why I love my OnePlus One.. it is a big screen with capacitive buttons. (But I need to fix it to match the order of on-screen button) OnePlus 2 had also a great example of capacitive buttons..letting you switch their orders. northstar17 The Moto X 2015 devices and Nexus 6 are the best examples of hardware design IMO. Bezels are minimal while still having front speakers. A front button is a deal breaker for me. Poodz And the original moto x has the smallest bezel on the entire chart. Good job Motorola! vwnut13 The Moto E LTE has a small bottom bezel that becomes about equal with the top once the buttons are on the screen. i_say_uuhhh One thing I liked about Moto is that they knew how to keep bezels small while cramming speakers and having a nice big screen. Berkay Lol the bezels on the Moto X Pure put the HTC One series to shame :D mzrdisi I think software buttons are ugly and awkward to use and I have never seen any advantage to having software buttons. All of the advantages all seemed to be in theory and basically over time they've been proven to be useless ideas. TheSpaceUnicorn I just don't like capacitive buttons as I find that I accidentally touch capacitive buttons much more often then on screen buttons. I prefer to have either 1 physical button that does everything like the iPhone or the on screen buttons, not a physical home button and then capacitive buttons around it. invinciblegod I hate capacitive buttons because they take up space on the bezel where I would want to rest my fingers. I remember having a Galaxy S3 and accidentally pressing the back button ALL THE TIME. Sir_Brizz I feel the same way. Physical buttons can't go away when you don't want or need them and they are always waiting for you to push them. When I had a GS3, I was always bumping nav button when I was just trying to hold my device. With the on screen buttons, that doesn't really happen to me. Martim Samsung actually has a new option on the S7 and S7 Edge to disable the recents and back button in games for precisely that reason, iirc. person Isn't that just when playing games, and only when you launch them through their launcher? AsterMK MIUI too, although it's system wide and can work in any app. It works wonders, but then again immersive mode is still better. RIsoldier and now you've neglected to mention immersive mode in the comments section.. wtf Marko Šaric I like on screen buttons. Nice article man. WORPspeed Haven't read the article in full, because it is full of very valid comments, but they all miss the point. They are flexible for when you need them somewhere else, they get out the way when you don't need them and most important of all (for me personally): When the screen is off, the front of you phone looks unimaginably much more beautiful than with nav buttons on there. FunctionOverForm They get out the way? look at Chrome, photos, lots of google apps. accept it Software keys only advantage is aesthetics. WORPspeed They get out of the way when I watch a movie (immersive mode) Sir_Brizz or play a game or really enter full screen mode from anywhere, even Chrome and Photos. prwnd You should bring Nexus 6 for bezel example instead o 6P Greg Miernicki TLDR; northstar17 Perhaps the push towards larger screens limited the potential of smaller bezels? So many factors, I think this article has good points but in the end only Samsung really offers a button still and a few smaller players. Try using a Samsung tablet in landscape, how is that better than virtuall buttons that rotate? Its terrible actually. BubbleCloudWidgets+WearLaunchr I buy Samsungs because they don't follow Google in all of their decisions. I think hw keys are practical. And so is sdcard extention. And close-all-tasks buttons in the task switcher. (In many other I wish they'd follow Google more closely). There is no perfect phone, because each of us have different tastes and needs. I am glad there are so many options, there is a best for everyone. rick slick 100% this. Stupid_Sexy_Quilava Imoh the fact alone that you can't accidentally press them when you are doing stuff puts the on-screen buttons above capacitive buttons. And if we are really going to say that they take space that can be used to display content; I have to point out that they are usually (I say usually cause the placement of the navbar is the bane of the nexus 7) placed along the shorter side of the display so they don't really take any valuable space and when they are not needed they disappear. Also, and this is just my opinion, they improve the user experience as keep interacting with the screen is much nicer than go back and forth between screen and buttons. person Scaling the interface upwards: However much of a tossup the value of a virtual nav bar may be on a phone, it's definitely valuable on a tablet, which tends to be orientation independent and is more likely to be used by a variety of input methods (i.e. a mouse). Physical navigation keys give the device an orientation bias and mitigate its usability in the opposite orientation. Updating design/features: Given that there are are multiple buttons of various uses, the buttons can't be unmarked as with the iPhone/iPad. Since they must be graphical, they must adhere to some particular aesthetic that may change over time and it's good that older devices can be updated to the new aesthetic. Also a variety of gestures have come and gone from the nav bar that would have not been possible with physical keys. Creating/repurposing devices: The point the nav bar easing putting Android on a variety isn't in the cases where the interface needs to be adapted, but where it doesn't. Phones and tablets originally running different OSes, laptops, desktops, AiOs, kiosks, etc. can all easily have Android ported because of the nav bar. Adaptability/feedback: The nav keys generally are what they need to be or are gone when they aren't needed at all. During setup where they do nothing they are next and previous buttons. On the lock screen they are voice/call, lock and camera shortcuts. On the authentication input screen, where the only the back button does anything, that's the only button present. The back key rotates with the keyboard up and, as of Android N, the Overview key changes to indicate when you are in multi-window mode. When playing games and watching videos the nav bar goes away entirely as it can be assumed that you're in no hurry to leave the app intentionally or accidentally. They also change brightness along with the screen. Free space to hold: Back when I had a Galaxy S, when I would hand my phone to my iPhone-toting associates, they would consistently rest their thumb on the bezel and leave the screen if not the app entirely. I, myself would regularly brush them while watching movies and playing games and eventually changed my grip to hold the phone on the sides. With a nav bar, I can hold my phone however I wish. Phone design: Having less built into the face of the device makes phones cheaper and easier to manufacture and give manufacturers a bit more freedom in how everything is proportioned and positioned. It also generally makes for a more simple and clean look. Alvin Wong Thinking about the days when it was a norm for Android phones to have hardware buttons makes me shudder. Inconsistent layouts reigned supreme with every OEM coming up with different ways to arrange four buttons on the front of a phone. What made it worse - sometimes the hardware buttons didn't even work as you'd expect (the Xperia S comes to mind immediately) and gripping the bottom bezel of the phone (i.e. when taking photos) often infuriatingly activated one of those damn capacitive buttons that ought to have been software-based from the very beginning. I think we're in a much better place now. Samsung is the only major holdout while everyone else has gone with a standard control layout or they provide a choice between software and hardware keys. From across the pond in Windows Phone land, we've also had to transition to on-screen controls over the past couple of years with new devices having somewhat smaller bottom bezels as a result. The difference in the way Microsoft has implemented this feature as opposed to Google is in allowing the user to hide and reveal the on-screen controls at will, even in apps like the web browser that aren't classed as immersive displays. On an Android phone, those navigation buttons are going to stand resolute and you can't really do anything to dismiss them and regain the screen real estate, which would have otherwise allowed for an extra line or two of text in a lengthy article to be displayed at a time. Abd Hardware buttons are available 100% of the time even if the screen isn't. A front fingerprint scanner is much more convenient for me. 100% of the screen is available 100% of the time to enjoy the gorgeous sAMOLED display without those ugly buttons on it. mauric until you put it in your pocket, and the Galaxy home button wakes your device and start calling everyone.... Abd Never ever happened to me for 5+ years RIsoldier I have had times when each scenario would have been better. scanner on the back is better in my pocket and in the hand. On the table it would be better if it was on the front, but i solved that mostly with saved locations or whatever its called mauric Happens 100 times a day for 5 years, so never again... rick slick don't be so clumsy. Put the phone screen away from your skin. This happens with virtual buttons too. mauric Yeah, beause a. You will have to turn your phone everytime when you take it out and put it in and b. The screen is way more vulnerable this way and c. The curves are the wrong way so it feels awkward.. Alexander Sofinskiy Wow what an article..some much words about this (Why?) Moto x, Nexus 6, LG g2 - g4, Nexus 4. All this phones do their best for soft nav buttons and bezels. Ravi Other advantages of onscreen buttoms are - visual feedback of touch rather than haptic - can be used for shortcuts like multiwindow for N -keyboard options while typing -can be inverted for left handed users person "Can be inverted for left handed users" Or RTL interfaces. Good point. Michael M. 1) a. haptic is always better because you can feel the button if it is fully physical. b. visual feedback can be realised with backlight. 2) nothing special about it. 3) keyboard is getting even more higher - have to make keys even smaller to set it height. 4) there are at least 2 different ways of placing back and recent buttons. I am right handed and have tried both - nothing too complex of using any of these ways. For left handed it is even more convenient to use physical buttons cause it will stay on the left side when you put your phone on the right side. RIsoldier How exactly does the author of this article never mention immersive mode once? What a shit article Martim "One of the most touted advantages of on-screen buttons is that they provide the best of both worlds: the navigation buttons are present when they're needed, but they can hide away when they're not (such as when watching a video) — freeing up valuable screen space. The assumption here is that on-screen buttons use up the space that would have otherwise been used for hardware buttons, so that in the worst case (i.e. when the on-screen buttons are visible), the amount of usable screen space is the same. In reality, what most often happens is that instead of increasing the screen height (or decreasing the bezel width), on-screen buttons take up what was previously free screen real estate, so that in the best case (when the nav buttons are hidden), you've got same available area." RIsoldier The history of immersive mode in android isn't mentioned at all. Describing it as buttons occasionally disappearing once in the article hardly does justice to its usefulness. It's never mentioned again (not once by name), and the rest of the articles points are all backed up by use cases where immersive mode wasn't taken into account. Prepagan How can immersive mode be an argument *for* on-screen buttons? There are no on-screen buttons in immersive mode. Immersive mode is merely a counter to the argument that on-screen buttons get in the way. The fact that immersive mode is employed so inconsistently across applications obviously speaks to how effective that counter might be. Gerardo Sarabia Tapping on the Home button works just fine on my Nexus 6P. Google Now Launcher. RIsoldier #6Pmasterrace J3R3MY_H Virtual buttons allow for a larger screen to still be usable with one hand Gerardo Sarabia I think the actual benefits of on-screen navigation buttons could materialize now that Android is going more into productivity and multitasking. For example, drag and drop something from one app to the recents button and then dropping it into another app. Or drag something from Google Chrome to the home button and then having a shortcut to that on the homescreen. Swiping as you do in Chrome to switch between related tabs. Google is probably still experimenting the possibilities, and because is deeply integrated with the experience on Android, they can't just start throwing shit into it just because they can. I miss the swipe up for opening Google Now, tho. RIsoldier Yes!, the possibilities are endless TheCarlosFontes You guys remember the G1 with the search button? That was fun :) I do like the software buttons. It makes the device look so slick to me. Terrell L Washington The Nexus 6 which I had two of them both suffered from severe screen burn in. I think thats why samsung wont do it. Any Nexus 6p owners have a burn in problem? RIsoldier nope, none at all. My old Gnex had it, and the note 3 I had was the worst offender I've ever seen. My G3 was pretty great, cant remember if it burnt in though. Sir_Brizz I've heard of people having this problem but I guess I don't run my brightness high enough to cause a problem. jcopernicus Google sucks at UX. News @....24/7 GG Michael M. Google just can't stick one way in all their products and for at least little while. And another problem is that not only they can't find and stick their way, they can't make any of the devs- software or hardware do the same. Michael M. Great article! I never was a fan of on-screen buttons. For all the arguments that they can be remapped, I can say there are examples of physical sensor buttons under screen that can be remapped either. Even physical keyboard from pre-android era on some devices had remapped buttons for music players for instance. Lateef Alabi-Oki Hardware buttons just introduce another point of failure. I've seen many iPhones rendered completely useless once that home button becomes faulty or fails. Not to mention every Android vendor arranges and implements the behavior of hardware buttons differently. Onscreen navigation buttons provide a clear, consistent, global and efficient way to navigate the OS. It has very little to do with bezel size. Michael M. Software buttons can be easily changed by vendor so do hardware - all is in a vendors hands anyway. That means that consistent is under big question here. iPhones can be used without home button, cause they have accessibility software button you can place on the screen. Lateef Alabi-Oki Software buttons can be easily changed by vendor In practice, that hardly ever happens. I've yet to use an Android phone where the Vendor changes the arrangement and behavior of the software buttons. In contrast, every Android phone with hardware buttons I've used have always had inconsistent arrangement and behavior. iPhones can be used without home button, cause they have accessibility software button you can place on the screen. Most users don't know that. Which constitutes a usability problem. Anish Bhalerao Umm... rick slick Haven't had any hardware buttons fail yet. but seen plenty of nav buttons burn in on AMOLED screens. Marcellus1 I wonder if part of the reason we don't have smaller bottom bezels is because manufacturers want the device to look balanced. I know I questioned the looks of the Nexus 6 when it came out because the top and bottom bezels were not the same size. I realize that there are a number of phones in your data that do not have equal top/bottom bezels, but it seems that the most popular ones typically do--iPhone, Samsung phones, etc. reXXar I'm with the hardware buttons. There's nothing to hate abt on-screen keys though (many ROMs actually provide arrow control on the nav-bar while typing). But when u have hardware keys, u just know which side they are on no matter how u hold ur phone bcz they don't change position. That feels better. Ryu My reason for preferring them is because they are easy to reach and easier to press (versus a physical home button). I also despise capacitive buttons because I always accidentally bump them with my hand when, say watching video (because they are so close to the edge of the phone where I'm gripping it). Grayson Here's one argument for on-screen nav buttons... a thread with hundreds of complaints about the recents capacitive button on the Galaxy S7 randomly triggering recent apps or the multi-tasking UI even though it isn't being touched: http://forum.xda-developers.com/s7-edge/help/false-recent-app-presses-causing-multi-t3333785 I can find a lot of threads for various phones on XDA and Reddit with people complaining about faulty / glitchy capacitive buttons or loose physical home buttons. Capacitive and physical buttons just seem to be a LOT more prone to manufacturing defects. And it makes sense. Any time you are adding more physical components to something, the chances of defects goes up significantly. CrazyManDan Personally I don't understand the bezel hate. When I use a device in landscape mode to watch a video, I need someplace to put my thumb, and a modestly sized bezel is perfect for that. Capacitive buttons aren't a panacea either; it's quite annoying adjusting my grip and accidentally brushing the back button. Then again, I have large hands, so a few extra millimeters before the screen starts don't really deter me. Fatal1ty_93_RUS I think that ultimately the Navbar faces several issues: 1) It's fixed to either being displayed on the right in landscape (if you take a phone and rotate it 90 degress to the left), or in the bottom in portrait. It can't go in the upper part or to the left somewhat limiting your usage/holding position 2) Too few developers use the Immersive Mode where it's needed which results in both Status Bar and Nav Bar take up the screen space permanently 3) Google hasn't done almost ANYTHING to actually improve the navbar as a concept in terms of functionality. Yeah, the Home button now serves as a Google Now shortcut, yes the Recents button can now switch you back to the previous app (starting with N), and yes you can Pin apps with Recent button + Home button But it's still just THREE Buttons. Look at LG - they have absolutely no issues adding more buttons to the navbar, increasing the count up to 5, while giving you certain useful shortcuts like pulling down the Notification Shade or accessing the Power Menu or locking your device. And Google has zero progress towards that. There's SO MUCH that can be done with Navbar alone via custom buttons/actions, that you would be able to do with them more than with Capacitive buttons, as Custom ROMs and Xposed Modules show us. And on larger screens (6"+ phones, 7"+ tablets, 10" tablets, laptops, etc) you have even MORE space to put functional buttons on, and instead 80% of the space at the bottom is unoccupied by anything, wasting it completely magnamentis capacitive buttons don't take any space and my virtual navbars are always in immersive mode, hence full autohiding and showing on demand, similar to the dock in OSX can be setup, which BTW i have on the side, no idea why it's on the bottom by default where space is limited in hight while there is usually plenty in with. blue device is OP2 with capacitive buttons + software buttons immersive and the green device is a Nexus 6 with a very small bottom bezel and immersive navbar, all devices with PIE BTW all this means maximal usable display real estate and all kind of navigaton combined depending on situation and need. PIE on the side is perfect for one handed usage while capacitive buttons are perfect when the device is on the desk etc. Philip Worthington I am used to software buttons now, but I can't say I prefer them. In fact, it was something that nearly swayed me to getting a Samsung phone, but I still can't quite stomach TouchWiz despite all the improvements that have been made to it. HR It's funny how Sony has smaller bezels on smaller phones. Both the Z3C and the Z5C have smaller bottom and top bezels than their bigger brothers. Yes, they are thicker, but still... it's weird. djakdekiel I prefer software buttons because I can change position of back button :D I hate samsung back button position:D Dave Nah none of these reasons apply for me. I prefer on-screen buttons for their feel/feedback. I love their haptic similarity with say, using an on-screen keyboard. These days pressing a physical home button feels really jarring to me. Semianonymous I like on screen buttons because they go away when I'm watching something, preventing mispressing. I was constantly bumping the capacitive buttons on my galaxies. common sense I use have a bexus 5 and went to a note 5 and i do miss the software buttons. One thing i noticed is my accidental button pressing has increased and has made me hold my phone different. There is nowhere to hold the phone when you have physical buttons. vwnut13 Why physical (capacitive) buttons suck. They are either lit up all the time, lit up when you touch the screen, or never lit up. And capacitive buttons are separate from the screen, so the brightness can be wonky. Averix I prefer the physical buttons. I hate wasting screen real estate for virtual buttons. Not to mention their flaky behavior. Sorry, I've been in this camp for a while and no Nexus has changed my mind. matus201 I had Xperia Arc, then Nexus 4, Nexus 5, Nexus 6p, and now Galaxy S6. I got used to every phone, but definitely the physical buttons on Xperia Arc and Galaxy S6 are preferable IMO to the virtual buttons on the Nexus. As this article stated, all devices had more or less equally sized bottom lip. Cory Wilson Eh I just like them for the clean looking front, and the consistency. The Doctor I don't care one way or the other about this. When I'm making a phone purchasing decision, the type of buttons that's on the phone isn't on my list. Onel Benjamin "Take the Nexus 6P and the Nexus 5X, for example. They both have about the same bottom bezel size, measuring around 16.0 and 16.2 millimeters, respectively. But compare this to the 17.2 millimeters you'll find on an iPhone 6S (which sports a huge home button on the bottom of the device) and suddenly it's not clear where all that saved space went." Yes, but the Nexus 6P has front facing speakers, that requires space. Not a fair comparison. Jarl I prefer software buttons on phones the last phone I had with hardware buttons was the Butterfly S. after that had the G3 and now the G4. I really hate tablets with hardware buttons though. and I still despise Google for moving the soft buttons to the friggin middle of the screen on tablets, navigation on tablets just plain sucks. there was nothing wrong with the left centered buttons in honeycomb. and if they HAD to move them, why not give an option to relocate them? dcdttu Looks so good when the screen is off? Updateable / future-proof? Customizable? Room for dual front speakers (6P)? Consistency? Multi-actionable buttons (swipe up for Google Now)? Back button can reshape to become the "remove keyboard from screen" button? Skinned version less likely to be fucked up and reversed forever (looking at you, Samsung)? Breno Tanure In my case, I MUCH prefer software buttons because they don't break. I've yet to see an iPhone with a perfect home button after a few months of use, and I'm VERY afraid of pressing my Note 5's home button because of that fear. I do tricks in order to only use the capacitive back key every time it's possible. GigiVald If you already don't know, there's an app which uses the capacitive habilites provided from Galaxies' fingerprint home button to avoid the need to press it. It consumes a few more battery and doesn't works on the lockscreen if "fingerprint" is used. But for me it's a great deal, its called easyHome Breno Tanure I'll give it a try, thanks! Cw Tham Well done! Such long article but no mention of durability of physical button. Haven't you seen enough of that floating software button used by 99% of iPhone users due to their less than reliable physical home button? So software button is a good enough reason to stay. P. Sherman I have a Galaxy Note 3 for over a YEAR now. I bought it pre owned so I don't know how long someone owned it before I did (I'd guess 2 but I digress.) And there is absolutely ZERO problems with my physical home button. It's still clicky, tactile, and responsive as like new. I can't vouch for the iPhone though, it's largely a design thing. rick slick Never had any hardware buttons break on any of my Android devices. Have seen tons of AMOLED screens with burned in NAV buttons. Ahmad El-Ibrahim I really want someone to upload screenshots of how much is really being missed of on screen space, in example open an article in the same spot on two devices one with on screen nav and the other with hardware buttons. It doesn't bother me much, but I really want to see what the people against on screen nav buttons really love. J_Pod No Lumia 950 or 950xl? :( Axel The moto x 1st gen has a really small bottom bezel and that's one of the reasons its still my favorite smartphone ever. I also find difficult to like a phone that I can't use comfortably with one hand (the limit for me is 5.2') Arabella Blair My opinion Nicholas C The weird camera thing, I believe, is so that you hand is never covering the camera in order to click the shutter button. So if the phone is upside down, and the shutter button is at the bottom, then you would have to hold the phone in a way that covers the camera. Muzaffar For me, i prefer on-screen navigation because i like to keep my phone as clean as possible without any weird symbol staying on surface. I usually remove the on-screen navigation and use gesture navigation to get full space of the screen. I only need to gesture from side of my phone where my thumb lies. rick slick You know what's funny? I actually prefer to use my phone instead of insisting it look a certain way or look sleek or clean. I want to have maximum on-screen display space... you know, practicality over how it looks. Hardware buttons are way better. PhaseBurn The Google Camera app, specifically mentioned for keeping its shutter button at the physical bottom of the phone despite what the navbar does, actually makes sense for a different reason. First off, where is the camera located on your phone? I'd wager it's at the top - both front facing, and, back. So if you're taking a photo, you're holding your phone at the physical bottom, regardless of its orientation. Otherwise, your hand is likely obscuring the camera. This is smart on Google's part to keep the camera opposite of the shutter button on the screen, especially when you're trying to take a selfie - the last thing you want to have happen is for the camera to be turned 90 degrees for a landscape, and, the button moves out of your one-handed reach and you drop your phone while trying to move your thumb over to the new button location. P. Sherman But more often than not, you use TWO hands to shoot a photo with your phone. And for the camera to not reflect where the shutter button would be located for that is bonkers. Say, a Nexus 6P from the upright position, then tilt it 90 degrees to the right, and left, there are folks who're more comfy with a LEFT-located shutter or RIGHT-located shutter, there should be an accomodation for that. Sir_Brizz That is absolutely not true when using the front camera especially. P. Sherman Why was that ever taken seriously, like Donald Drumpf's campaign? Sir_Brizz I bet you're fun at parties. Azortje Exactly, especially for selfies this would be a problem. Besides sometimes a selfie needs to be taken with your left hand and sometimes with your right, you wouldn't want the button to be stuck on 1 side in landscape. Diêgo Damohill Castro Lemos The most important reason: I don't need to add a floating nav bar on the screen in the case my default nav bar stops working if I press it too much. ;) Tj Hariharan I had an odd problem with my nexus5 (that i have since scrapped for obvious reasons). After a year or two of using it, I found that the "bottom of the screen" (when held in normal portrait) was completely unresponsive to touch. Regardless of how i rotated the phone, the same physical space on the phone is unresponsive (if i forced the ui to be upside down, the unresponsive part would be the notification shade and so on). The odd thing was, after some testing i found that the 'non responsive part of hte screen' EXACTLY corresponded to the location of the navbar (in terms of height), esp. since the navbar remains on the same physical location regardless of orientation on phones (unlike tablets). I ended up using the phone upside down, and adding an extra button in the navbar for pulling the notification shade down...which was an issue since the navbar is a lot taller than the notification shade (which meant a bit of the top of my screen was also non responsive, which was an issue once hamburger menus started to make their debut). I suspect this sort of issue would not exist with hardware buttons. Sir_Brizz You're right, instead the buttons can easily become non responsive as well. Diêgo Damohill Castro Lemos It's a touch screen issue that could have happened to ANY phone. And it surelly does happen more often with hardware buttons, it's the whole reason a virtual home button exists in the Iphone in the first place. rick slick Never had it happen with any of my Samsung devices. Love hardware buttons. ConCal On Screen > Hardware buttons rick slick False. ConCal Your false is false. krazyfrog Hardware buttons have and will always be superior. People like to say software buttons get out of the way when you want them to, such as in video apps. However, only apps specified for fullscreen use will hide the software buttons, and such apps are few and far between on our devices. Majority of the apps, such as messaging apps, don't use fullscreen mode. And it's especially egregious on messaging apps, where if you account for all the UI elements and the keyboard, the actual usable space left for the bloody messages is about 30% of the entire display, which is just plain stupid. And this happens in other types of apps as well, such as Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, etc. where the navigation buttons eat into the usable space of the app and there is nothing you can do about it. I haven't found a single, truly convincing reason to use software keys so far. And no, it "looks cool" is not a valid reason. UI should first work well, and then, if possible, look cool. Sir_Brizz I don't see how buttons using at most two lines of readable text, especially on apps like Facebook and Twitter where you are going to be scrolling a lot anyway, has any bearing on whether or not they are good. Alessandro and remember that if you break the display.......od the lower part of it, you can't even use the navigation buttons...because they're GONE.... together with the display! P. Sherman I HATE software buttons the same way I hate racists. They don't disappear with games, with Youtube on some phones, with stored video in plenty others. It's dumb. I know there's Immersive Mode, but not everyone uses it. Also, it's easier to toggle the back or home buttons to exit a game with a HARDWARE button instead of swiping left and right to enable the 'hidden' menus. At least with the hardware buttons, the screen is used to its MAXIMUM. Sir_Brizz I'm surprised you didn't get a "Hitler" in there :p P.S. The Nexus 6 has a much smaller bezel than the Note 3. The 6P's larger bezel was a design choice. P. Sherman ... A design choice which is UNnecessary. But I guess that works over there, so... Also, trust me. Coulda been worse. Sir_Brizz LOL. I don't agree it was unnecessary. I have an N5, N6, and 6P. The 6 is the hardest to use in landscape because the bezels are so small. The 6P is very nice in landscape because you can actually hold the bezels. People made the same complaint about the Nexus 7 2013, but it was actually better for watching movies and Youtube simply because you had a place to hold that wouldn't cover the screen or the speakers. BC I cant refute your evidence, but to answer the "So why do we like software buttons again?" question....Because its still a good idea. All its benefits are real benefits. True, that the implementation has sucked but that doesnt mean the idea itself is bad. On top off that the only argument for hardware buttons appears to be....it feels good to press. Angel In camera apps I believe that the reason for the shutter to stays in the oposite side of the camera is to avoid accidentally cover the lens with the hand. It makes sense in that regard. Manuel Vidigal (El Vidi) Also great for taking selfies with the left arm... Đức Thành Biased article is biased. rick slick No silly boy. Silly boy is silly. OrionBeast Together, not the same sized bezel. Android. we're great like that. b0b Hawt towpeak! fractious3 Consistency across devices is the biggest advantage to onscreen navigation buttons in my opinion. The fact that almost every hardware manufacturer chose to implement their own arrangement of buttons drove me mad in the pre-onscreen days - back on the left, back on the right...it was a nightmare if you use more than one device. Granted they can still reorganize them in software, but that doesn't seem to happen as frequently. kgptzac There are pros and cons for both options. The differences are mostly down to personal taste and usage pattern. This is the beauty of Android: you can choose one of the two choices instead of being forced to use either software, or hardware buttons. Channel 2012 Excellent write-up. It's about time somebody pointed out the follies of losing the buttons. TL;DR? The bezel is going to be a certain size no matter what, so you may as well stick some navigation buttons on it so they don't waste space on the screen. And developers, for the love of all that is Holy, stop putting menu buttons in the upper-left corner of applications where nobody can reach them. rick slick LOL right!! LeLwrence I wish my Nexus 5 had physical buttons like the Oneplus One... kwiato I remember geting my nexus 4, a beutiful, uninterupted block of glass on the front. The cool factor was strong with this one. And I tell you I hate a phisical buttons on iOS devices, the fact that I need to switch from gently tapping my screen to actually pressing a button is annoying. meyerweb I've used phones with hardware buttons, and I've used phone with software buttons. At the present time, the only advantage I've found to software buttons is that they can be themed, which is kind of cool, but hardly much of a functional advantage. If Google and app developers actually took any significant advantage of the fact that they can be context sensitive, my opinion would likely change, but that's not a valid argument today. The downside of software buttons is that they either take up screen space (the resolution of phones with on-screen buttons isn't any higher than phones with hardware buttons, so that nav bar is taking pixels from apps), or you're constantly swiping to unhide the nav bar. I don't have a strong preference either way, but have no issue with the hardware buttons on my current S7 Edge. I certainly don't feel like I'm losing anything, the buttons are always there, not coming and going, and they don't take any real estate away from my apps. Žarko Korać Well, if my first smartphone (HTC Desire) had on-screen nav buttons I would still be able to use it today. Physical buttons died after a couple of years - the only thing that broke. Even the battery is still usable. Just gimme some buttons on the side, and nothing but screen in the front. Markoff you forgot two important reasons: sometimes capacitive buttons have no backlight quite often capacitive buttons lose sensitivity over time unlike touch screen lefthandedbears One thing that was not addressed in this article is the possibility of hardware failure. Physical buttons, being moving parts have a certain lifespan for number of presses before the average failure. By eliminating those parts, you have one (or 3) less parts that could break. More physical movement = more risk of breakage rick slick Haven't had any hardware buttons break. On the other hand, have seen a ton of AMOLED screens with burned in nav buttons. tmartin As with many things Google, it's clear that the promise of software buttons has not been completely fulfilled. I think the example of the camera app is a good one. Google frequently looks like an organization where not only does the right hand not know what the left is doing, but sometimes the right thumb doesn't know what the right index finger is doing. When Google get's it right, though, they really get it right. This is an area where they have not gotten it right. That said, I stand by software buttons because of their flexibility. They can disappear, they don't break and, also not mentioned, they can be updated with the OS (if the OS gets updated but that's another story). nasznjoka For some one not used to software nav buttons you're gonna hate it..... I have been on Samsung since the beginning now I am using a part time lenovo phone with software nav, guess what? My experience is pretty bad, every time i am typing instead of hitting space btn am hitting the home button i have to restart ... daym I hate software nav bars Alessandro ahahahhaa really bad Nicholas Conrad the entire navigation bar will be swept away from under your fingers, forcing you to either use both hands or to attempt a strange, single-handed shuffle so that you can reach the navigation buttons once again. And you've just described the daily experience of software nav keys for left-handers. hirsch4u Please replace the HTC One M8, M9 and the Sony Xperia Z5 Premium with the Moto X² the LG G2 and the LG G4 and then do your math again. For me it looks like you were trying to find the fitting data to your opinion. If you are looking for "one" valid proof of a theory four quarters won't count. schlanz Good article. I personally like having Samsung's home button. Turns on display, doubles as quick camera launcher, triples as fingerprint scanner. I'll take that over a second speaker, which imho is another overrated hardware feature when we have bluetooth devices everywhere. rick slick Amen, I hate on-screen nav buttons. Capacitive buttons are the way to go, for the reasons mentioned in the article. Until bottom bezels disappear entirely, using on-screen real estate for virtual buttons is a huge waste of space. beginner99 Thanks for this article and the conclusion. I always felt phones with on-screen buttons tend to have larger bezels. It's ridiculous. But coming from an engineering standpoint, on-screen buttons just tells me the manufactured wanted to cut costs. No need for the hardware buttons. It then also makes sense they also cut costs in optimizing the bezel to actually make it smaller. On screen-buttons is a no-go for me. Now I have to admit the physical home button the Galaxy phones use isn't ideal. Why the heck aren't' there any phones with 3 capacities buttons anymore? I'm stuck with my old LG Optimus G phone...which also has a great screen to body ratio... Alessandro i would say.... if 3 buttons are ON SCREEN = you are KO in case the display is cracked on a bad fall...... DavidMoreau I want 3 physical buttons. I'm sick of touch capacitive, which seem to be the worst of both worlds. I'm tired of my palm brushing onscreen or touch capacitive back buttons. It frustrates me to the point of considering an iPhone. antonio cesar It would be cool an updated version of this article with those high screen to body ration phones.

It's one feature I've come to rely on to find all the photos I have of specific friends or family members and even photos of "person X and person Y and person Z" together. But there were still a couple of small things missing from Photos' facial recognition like the option to manually tag a person in a pic or the ability to see who Google had recognized in a photo from the photo itself, not their dedicated page. But the latter is now implemented. Actually, it was implemented at some point in the last few versions: I can confirm that it wasn't there in 2.10.0.148909749 but it is live in 2.12.0.151124741, so it was added to Photos sometime between March 13 and 30. Small details aside, this is a simple but nice change. When you tap in the Info icon on any photo while you're browsing your library, you will see a new People section below Description and above Details. In it are thumbnails of all the people Google has recognized in your pics. You can tap the thumbnail to immediately go to that person's dedicated Photos page with all the albums and pictures they're in. Zaher is a very dear friend with an undying love for Android. I'll make him pay for the free publicity. This is a great way to see who Google has tagged in your photos and to jump to individual people's photos without searching for them first. It still doesn't seem to be possible to manually tag someone in your Photos but I'd imagine the function is coming at some point. Google Photos 2.12.0.151124741 has been live on the Play Store for a few days but it's also on APK Mirror if you prefer to grab it there.

Trying to switch to one of these accounts in Google Photos causes the app to crash, and it has been this way since version 2.10.0 Ibrahim Yusuf You're right it crashes on me too makapav I believe, brand accounts/pages were deprecated a long time ago. vwnut13 Creating a new Brand Account is still available on both Google+ and Youtube. Actually, it's not only available, but there is a direct link to create a Brand Account on the Google+ homepage. Suicide_Note Now we just need to be able to manually tag people in a photo. Capt4chris And for search to include shared albums. :-) chris mellor Im on 2.12 and still dont have this feature. johnforamerica Bring back the damn cloud backup icon on individual thumbnails! Since that went away, no way to tell which photos are backed up! (Other than opening each individual photo) Suicide_Note Agreed. It would be nice to have that back. Dennis Ulijn It'll tell you everything's backed up or how many items still need to backed up. I understand not every solution is perfect for everyone, but what would the clutter of a cloud symbol in each photo solve? johnforamerica It would solve exactly what I described. I selectively back up, I don't want everything backed up. With a library of thousands of pictures, you tell me how to figure out which have not yet been backed up... As it functions now, I have NO IDEA what is backed up or not unless I use one of two crappy options: 1) Click on each pic individually to view the cloud icon showing backup status 2) Try to cross reference my device photos with the web version to see "what's missing" It seems pretty clear to me that Google wants to push its users to use the auto backup function, and this is just another step in trying to compel that usage. Dennis Ulijn Okay, fair enough. Thomas Stockx Is this a US only feature? I've been using Google Photo's for ages on my Nexus 6, 6P, and Pixel, but Google is unable to give me search results for any name. Dennis Ulijn Yes. Use a VPN to enable it once, and then it keeps working. You'd have to put in the names yourself though, but after that it keeps adding photos of that person. Florian Reisinger Where to enable it? Dennis Ulijn I think it's the option called 'face grouping'. I use tunnelbear to create a vpn to america. Ailín Ó’S Apparently it's against EU law or something to do that so it's not in Europe. But once you enable it once it works always. rumanuu76 Yep I visited USA, it started working and now always works 😎 towo Still not available in Germany. *sigh* Fruity101079 With a VPN (or chrome extension), fake your location and access google photos , you will be able to enable it. towo Doesn't seem to populate any face matches, though, or does it just take a long time?

Cecil Hardwood This only works for faces/people Google sees. I have lots of photos that for whatever reason Google has not identified any people in them or maybe 1 out of 3. It would be nice to be able to go back and add the ones Google missed. 4Ui812 You're a good looking lady Rita. It's a nice picture , you should use this one as your avatar.

ANY idea when this will be 'fixed' for the UK? jwildman16 Some others here stated that you can enable a VPN to a U.S. location, start adding names to faces, and then it will continue to do so after the VPN is disconnected. Matthew Merrick Doesn't matter. My Google Photos facial recognition wipes itself every 2 weeks for some godforsaken reason, rendering the service's most useful ability irrelevant, considering it rebuilds at not even one photo per day.

Security researches from Google and Lookout are warning Android users of malware that is capable of spying on them via their smartphone camera and microphone, as well as accesses their messages, emails, contact details, browser history and more. Called Chrysaor, this spyware is believed to be the sibling of Pegasus, which was an exploit that was used to spy on a United Arab Emirates human rights activist.  Scroll down for video  Security researches from Google and Lookout are warning Android users of malware that is capable of spying on them via their smartphone camera and microphone, as well as access messages, emails, contact details, browser history and more CHRYASOR ATTACK  Chyrasor is capable of spying on them via their smartphone camera and microphone, as well as access messages, emails, contact details, browser history and more.  Researcher believe the NSO group is behind it - the same organization that released Pegasus on iOS iPhone users in the Middle East. In the Android version, hackers built functionality that lets the spyware ask for permissions - granting it access to the phone. The failsafe jumps into action if the initial attempt to root the device fails. What could make this spyware so sophisticated is that it is designed to uninstall itself if it is at risk of being detected. In Greek mythology, Chrysaor is the brother of the winged horse Pegasus and researches believe the group behind the previous attack was also involved with the latest one – the NSO Group. NSO Group is a highly secretive Israeli-based organization that was acquired by U.S. company Francisco Partners Management in 2010, and according to news reports specializes in 'cyber war.' In a statement from August 2016, which stopped short of acknowledging that the spyware was its own, the NSO Group said its mission was to provide 'authorized governments with technology that helps them combat terror and crime.' And this organization also charges people to hack phones - the asking price starts at $1 million, Engadget reported. The difference is that Pegasus was zero-day iOS attack on iPhone users in the Middle East. Researcher were led to believe the software was used to target Ahmed Mansoor, an internationally recognized human rights defender and a Martin Ennals Award Laureate, based in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

Share this article Share 53 shares 'In the Android version, however, the attackers built in functionality that would allow Pegasus for Android to still ask for permissions that would then allow it to access and exfiltrate data,' Mike Murray, VP of security intelligence at Lookout, shared in a blog post. 'The failsafe jumps into action if the initial attempt to root the device fails.' 'This means Pegasus for Android is easier to deploy on devices and has the ability to move laterally if the first attempt to hijack the device fails.' WHO IS BEHIND THE ATTACKS?   Trident is used in a spyware product called Pegasus, which according to an investigation by Citizen Lab, is developed by an organization called NSO Group.  NSO Group is an Israeli-based organization that was acquired by U.S. company Francisco Partners Management in 2010, and according to news reports specializes in 'cyber war.'  Founded in Israel five years ago by entrepreneurs Omri Lavie and Shalev Hulio, NSO makes software that secretly targets a user's mobile phone and gathers information, including text messages, photos and internet browning data.  'We're a complete ghost,' NSO co-founder Omri Lavie told Defense News, a military trade publication, last summer.  'We're totally transparent to the target, and we leave no traces.' Google has acknowledged Chrysaor and noted that 'a few dozen Android devices' may have been infiltrated. But these devices are mostly in hotspots or war zones like Israel, Georgia, Mexico, Turkey, UAE and Ukraine What could make this spyware so sophisticated is that it is designed to uninstall itself if it is at risk of being detected. 'Pegasus for Adroid will remove itself from the phone if the SIM MCC ID is invalid, an 'antidote' file exists, it has not been able to check in with the servers after 60 days, or it receives a command from the server to remove itself,' shared Murray. Murray and his team reached out to Google Android after uncovering signs of the attack. Chrysaor  is believed to be the sibling of Pegasus, which was an exploit that was used to spy on a United Arab Emirates human rights activist. And what makes this attack so lethal is that Chrysaor is designed to uninstall itself if it is at risk of being detected Google has acknowledged Chrysaor and noted that 'a few dozen Android devices' may have been infiltrated. But these devices are mostly in hotspots or war zones like Israel, Georgia, Mexico, Turkey, UAE and Ukraine.  'Although the applications were never available in Google Play, we immediately identified the scope of the problem by using Verify Apps,' Google shared in a recent blog post. 'We gathered information from affected devices, and concurrently, attempted to acquire Chrysaor apps to better understand its impact on users.' 'We've contacted the potentially affected users, disabled the applications on affected devices, and implemented changes in Verify Apps to protect all users.'   Read more: Invasive, self-destructing iOS hack is even worse on Android Pegasus for Android: the other side of the story emerges | Lookout Blog Share or comment on this article e-mail 53 shares Most watched News videos Driving tutor caught shouting and swearing at kids on horseback Shocking video shows 'Spice zombies' frozen by illegal drug Disturbing footage of attempted child abduction in Philadelphia Police officer stops press conference to arrest man Shocking video shows effects of stomach acid mixed with coke Bus driver KICKS passenger after throwing him off the bus Kendall Jenner stars in Pepsi's 'Live for Now Moments Anthem' ad Semi-decapitated teen tells police his shocking attack story Touching moment grieving mum sees robin on her son's grave Couple caught getting frisky in university building Horrific moment bullfighter is gored by 1,000lb bull in Madrid Heston Blumenthal confuses The Project desk with awkward interview Widower staying with his own daughter, 13, is accused of...

If not, all you really need to know is that the chip is a custom ASIC designed by Google to accelerate the inference phase of machine learning tasks. Google initially said that the TPU could improve performance-per-watt in those tasks by a factor of ten in comparison to traditional CPUs and GPUs. Now, the company has released some performance data in the form of a study analyzing the performance of the TPU since its quiet introduction in 2015. The short version is that predicting a 10x uplift in performance-per-watt was Google's way of being modest. The actual increase for that metric was between 30 and 80 times that of regular solutions, depending on the scenario. When it comes to raw speed, Google says its TPU is between 15x to 30x faster than using standard hardware. The software that runs on the TPU is based on Google's TensorFlow machine learning framework, and some of these performance gains came from optimizing it. The writers of the study say that there are further optimization gains on tap, too. Apparently, Google saw the need for a chip like the TPU as far back as six years ago. Google uses machine learning algorithms in many of its projects, including Image Search, Photos, Cloud Vision, and Translate. By its nature, machine learning is computationally intensive. By way of example, the Google engineers said that if people used voice search for three minutes a day, running the associated speech recognition tasks without the TPU would have required the company to have twice as many datacenters.

T3 The Gadget Website Search News Reviews Mobile Entertainment Home & Kitchen More Living Auto Magazine More This is the Samsung Galaxy S8 Nintendo Switch review Huawei P10 review 2017's best phone? Huawei P10 Plus review: a power-packed big screen superphone to reckon with Although it won't be to everyone's taste, the P10 Plus has power to burn and a camera to capture crisp, vibrant shots By Dan Grabham   Shares Our Verdict One of the best big screeners you can buy; svelte design, excellent camera and competitive pricing for the amount of storage. For Quick, feature-packed cameras 128GB of storage as standard Fast fingerprint reader We like the navigation key Against Software still lags behind No HDR display Not waterproof or dustproof Pre-installed apps need slimming down If you’re in the market for a large-screen phone, things are getting crowded. There are more to choose from than ever, including the iPhone 7 Plus, Samsung Galaxy S8+, LG G6 and Huawei’s own supersized Mate 9.  Things are getting BIG. Here at T3.com we’re big fans of large-screened phones and things sure have moved on over the last year or so. No longer is it ridiculous to have a near 6-inch screen on a smartphone.  At Mobile World Congress this year we saw the debut of Huawei’s mainstream flagship, the 5.1-inch P10. We do like the P10, but it is pricier than other past Huawei handsets. However, it also has a bigger brother, the P10 Plus, with a 5.5-inch screen just like the 7 Plus. And after using one for a few weeks we can tell you; this is a fantastic alternative to the iPhone 7 Plus and Galaxy S8 series. Where the P10 Plus doesn’t do so well against other flagships is with a few of its specs - it isn’t waterproof, doesn’t have HDR support and doesn’t have wireless charging, for example - but this is a power handset to be reckoned with, featuring a powerful ‘octacore’ processor, 6GB of memory and a whopping 128GB of storage as standard in the UK (Huawei is making a 64GB version, too).  And then there’s the price. The P10 Plus represents much better value versus the base iPhone 7 Plus at £40 less SIM-free and with a huge amount more memory - 128GB versus 32GB of the base iPhone. Indeed, the SIM-free iPhone 7 Plus with 128GB of memory is £140 more than the P10 Plus. It’s also 0.3mm thinner than the 7 Plus and avoids having a camera lens bulge unlike the 7 Plus, too.  The P10 Plus is available in various colours including Pantone’s colour of the year (known as ‘greenery’) but it looks like you’ll find it most stores and pockets in one of the standard colours - silver (like our review sample), gold or black.  Based around Huawei’s EMUI 5.1 skin running atop Android 7.0 Nougat, the software still needs some polish. While other key Android manufacturers either plump for stock Android or increasingly try and skin in a very restrained fashion, Huawei’s EMUI still feels like it lags behind even if it has come on a lot in terms of usability over the last couple of years - the app drawer is back if you want it.  The most irritating thing about EMUI is actually the Phone Manager app which pops up regular notifications about power intensive apps, but just enables you to close them rather than do anything constructive. What’s more, is it really necessary to close apps in 2017? A lot of our issues are with the Huawei themes, many of which just aren’t quite to our taste. There are a lot of themes to choose from, however,  There’s still a problem with dupe apps for example - the phone comes pre-loaded with Google Calendar and a Huawei Calendar app meaning that when you enter your Google Account details into the phone you get two calendar apps sending you notifications for your next meeting. This is OK if you’re tech savvy and know how to turn notifications off or uninstall one of them. For others it just represents a poor user experience.  Moving on from the software, we’ve been big fans of Huawei’s hardware since the P8, and loved using the P9, Nexus 6P (a particular favourite) and recently the Mate 9.  The P10 line marks somewhat of a departure for Huawei in terms of earlier models - the fingerprint reader has been moved from the back onto a new Navigation Key. Interestingly, Samsung’s new S8 line has done exactly the reverse because of the lack of real estate around the screen on the front. But where Huawei’s rear fingerprint reader placement made sense, Samsung’s is placed right next to the camera, which just isn’t as simple and will take a little getting used to.  Huawei’s Navigation Key is one of those user interface features that will device opinion and to be honest we were initially unconvinced. Why replace the standard Android on-screen three key navigation with something completely different? But we’re quite happy to admit we were wrong; it takes so little time to get used to and works so well. It’s a single quick press for back. Press and hold to go back to the home screen. Swipe left or right to get to the app switcher. Swipe up to get to the Google app for search and more.  The key is also a fingerprint sensor and my - it is FAST to respond. If it reads your fingerprint OK - which it does more often than most recent fingerprint readers we’ve used - you barely notice the phone unlock.  However, the days of on-bezel controls are numbered for high end phones. Expect the P11 to have the same control but perhaps under the screen; that seems to be the way key user interface buttons are heading.  Everyone loved the Leica-engineered dual camera in last year’s Huawei P9 and alongside the Galaxy S7 camera (also in the S8 lineup), iPhone 7 Plus and Google’s Pixel snapper, it was one of the top camera phones of last year. The P10 Plus takes the same dual camera concept from the P9 and P10 but with upgraded Summilux lenses. Again they’re placed neatly in the strip along the top of the phone and this makes for a very neat design. We also love the P10 Plus cameras app which gives you access to a Pro mode giving you access to ISO, white balance and autofocus settings among many other features. There’s also a Wide Aperture mode as well as Portrait - with the depth of field effect we’re now seeing everywhere - filters, panoramic, HDR and more.  Huawei P10 Plus camera samples - click through the gallery Image 1 of 9 Image 2 of 9 Image 3 of 9 Image 4 of 9 Image 5 of 9 Image 6 of 9 Image 7 of 9 Image 8 of 9 Image 9 of 9 Low light photos are especially good, while we got some stunning shots using the 20MP monochrome lens - in fact we often liked the results a lot more than the same shot in colour (the regular camera is a 12MP F1.8 sensor and the front camera is 8MP). Here's a panorama shot with the P10 Plus as well. The display is also a credit, with colours that pop  a Quad HD 1,440 x 2,560 resolution (540ppi, way more than the 400ish ppi of the 7 Plus and a bit shy of the Galaxy S8).  Our reviewer wasn’t thrilled with the battery life of the standard P10, but the 3750 mAh battery inside the P10 Plus means it holds its charge fairly well except - predictably - when downloading a lot of data over cellular. We found we were easily getting over 24 hours of use and standby from the handset, only needing to charge part way through the next morning.  What else? There are some nice little design touches including a red-edged power button (below). There’s a rarely-seen IR blaster in the top of the phone, the headphone jack is retained at ythe bottom alongside USB-C for charge and data.  The SIM tray also has space for a microSD card alongside for expandable storage. Finally - and interestingly - there’s a pre-fitted screen protector. We’ve seen this before from some manufacturers and we’re sure the facts show that it minimises returns and problems. It doesn’t look too bad in our opinion and you are able to peel it off.  However, be warned that if you do peel, your display will instantly become a fingerprint magnet. The screen doesn't appear to have any fingerprint-resistant (oleophobic) coating at all so expect smears and general greasiness. Nice!  T3 Verdict Despite a few flaws, we’re big fans of the power-packed and fun P10 Plus. It offers much more than the standard P10 and is a serious competitor to the iPhone 7 Plus.  The design is pretty special, the camera superb and the pricing competitive for the amount of storage. In short, it's one of the best big screen phones you can buy, with a generally awesome spec sheet.  We’ll see how the S8+ compares soon and that will be an interesting battle, as while the screen on that handset may impress, some of the tariffs and SIM-free pricing we’re seeing are rather expensive.  Now check out our standard Huawei P10 review as well as this year's best smartphones.

ATO boss Mark Konza did not confirm the companies involved in the reported 'debt dumping'.  Seven major technology companies including Google, Apple and Microsoft have been slammed with a $3 billion tax bill Financial Services Minister Kelly O'Dwyer (pictured) said the government would fight the companies in Federal Court after some reportedly said they would not pay up An insider told the Daily Telegraph the companies sent the tax bills include Google, Microsoft, Apple, BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto.   Mr Konza said more than 1,000 investigators looked into 71 multinationals that are coming into Australia and said he was determined to fight the tax avoidance. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next The billionaire who bought the 'world's most expensive... The ONE thing the world's most successful people credit with... Share this article Share He said one multinational has already flown representatives to Australia to discuss the tax bill. 'Mums and dads pay tax, they can't avoid it and do it because they know their tax goes towards paying for hospitals, school, roads, defence,' Ms O'Dwyer said. 'The Australian government will make sure that everyone pays the tax they owe, whether they're big multinationals or other individuals'.  On Wednesday, Rio Tinto confirmed it had been ordered to pay $447 million in tax after the Australian Commissioner of Taxation issued amended assessments from 2010 to 2013. 'This payment would be in addition to the $25.5 billion of taxes and royalties Rio Tinto paid in Australia during the same four-year period,' a statement from the miner read. The companies believed to be dodging tax in Australia are Google, Microsoft, Apple, BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto Both Apple and Microsoft said they comply with the tax law in Australia But the multinational said it would fight the ATO's assessment. 'The issue in dispute is the pricing of certain transactions between Rio Tinto entities based in Australia and the Group’s commercial centre in Singapore,' the statement said. 'Rio Tinto considers that its pricing is in accordance with the internationally recognised OECD guidelines and Australian domestic law.  'Rio Tinto will challenge the amended tax assessments, but will pay 50 per cent of the total amount to the ATO this month.' BHP Billiton said it was still in discussions with the ATO but will 'defend its position in court if necessary' and Google did not comment, according to the Daily Telegraph. Both Apple and Microsoft said they comply with the tax law in Australia.  'The Australian government will make sure that everyone pays the tax they owe, whether they're big multinationals or other individuals,' Ms O'Dwyer (pictured) said Read more: www.dailytelegra...

Photo by David Drexel via Wikimedia Commons (CC BY 2.0) Global Voices Advocacy's Netizen Report offers an international snapshot of challenges, victories, and emerging trends in Internet rights around the world. Elections have become a time when Internet censorship, online harassment, and the deliberate spread of misinformation escalate. Last year, social media networks were blocked in Uganda and Montenegro during national elections. In the Gambia and Gabon, the Internet was shut down altogether. Harassment of political candidates and activists alike was a hallmark of special parliamentary elections in Macedonia, presidential elections in the US, and last week’s chief executive elections in Hong Kong. As elections approach in Iran, hardliners are pressuring the Rouhani administration to block the Telegram messaging app. And the tide of harassment is rising in both Russia and France, as both nations prepare to choose their next leader. Elections in Armenia and Ecuador last week proved to be no exception. The lead-up to general elections in Armenia was marred by apparent attempts to thwart the online activities of journalists and at least one incident of fake news. A prominent civil society figure reported attempts by government-backed hackers to access his email account, and several Armenian journalists said their accounts on Twitter were suspended just before the vote. Their accounts have since been restored. Election monitors from the Organization for Security and Co-Operation in Europe (OSCE) said the elections, which resulted in the victory of the current ruling Republican Party of Armenia, were generally well-administered, but still tainted by credible accusations of vote-buying and undue influence on civil servants and employees of private companies. Meanwhile in Ecuador, opposition party candidates and supporters faced a wave of social media account suspensions, as did media rights NGOs. Pro-opposition websites and a handful of NGOs publishing voter education information noticed a sharp decline in web traffic on local ISPs on the evening of the election, leading to suspicions of interference. The website for the Internet access group Usuarios Digitales also experienced a DDoS attack a few days before the election, as did the website of opposition candidate Guillermo Lasso. LiveJournal seals deal with Russia, bans ‘political solicitation’ After the blogging platform LiveJournal — which was acquired by the Russian company SUP Media in 2007 — moved its data servers from California to Russia. This means that the website’s data will now be fully accessible to Russian police, in accordance with Russia’s recently enacted “anti-terrorist” legislation. Along with other restrictions, an updated LiveJournal user agreement prohibits “political solicitation”, but does not define the meaning of the term. Will Google go back to school in China? Google Scholar may be the first Google service to return to China, according to a statement by senior Chinese lawmaker Liu Binjie. “China has been in touch with Google through various channels,” Binjie said, signaling hope that a part of Google’s business (which Binjie described as “service functions that do not involve [politically] sensitive information”) would return to China first, and be gradually followed by others. Google pulled its services from the Chinese market in 2010 due to a conflict over China’s strict censorship rules, but has expressed interest in returning to the market. Binjie’s remarks did not make clear whether censorship would be implemented in any of Google’s services. Bangladesh regulator rejects Facebook bedtime ban The Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission rejected a proposal to block Facebook between the hours of midnight to 6:00am, a measure proposed by lawmakers who argued that Facebook was “dimming the working capabilities of the youths” and should therefore be inaccessible during bedtime hours. The BTRC instead has suggested that parental controls and privacy and security features would be a better method to achieve this objective. The BTRC’s recommendation now leaves the final decision up to the government. UAE intellectuals and activists face threats in court, and online Prominent academic Dr. Nasser bin Ghaith was sentenced by a UAE court to 10 years in prison for “posting false information” on Twitter about UAE leaders “in order to harm the reputation and stature of the State.” According to Amnesty International, bin Ghaith made comments on Twitter that he had not been given a fair trial in an earlier case in which he and four others were prosecuted for “publicly insulting” the country’s leaders in online comments, in what is known as the “UAE Five” case. He may appeal the sentence within 30 days. Dr. bin Ghaith’s case follows that of Ahmed Mansoor, another member of the UAE Five, who was arrested the week prior. Supporters of Mansoor who tweeted about his arrest were attacked for defending a “traitor that deserves to die”. Global Voices volunteers analyzed the interactions between supporters of Mansoor and those who attacked them and found that some of the most influential tweets critical of Mansoor came from accounts that appear to belong to government employees or affiliates, who led hardline government supporters in online attacks against Mansoor. Spy stingrays spotted in Canada An investigation by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation found that IMSI catchers, devices that spy on cellphones within a geographic area, are being used in the area around Ottawa’s Parliament Hill. Also known as Stingrays, IMSI catchers work by mimicking a cellphone tower and scooping up the data available within an area, typically of all devices within a radius of half a kilometer. Though CBC journalists confirmed that the IMSI catchers were being persistently used around Parliament, they were not able to determine who was using them. Indian developers take on “fake news” on WhatsApp, Facebook Two Indian technologists, Bal Krishn Birla and Shammas Oliyath, are working to build a website, check4spam.com, which will help to detect fake messages spread using WhatsApp and Facebook. The initiative aims to curb the spread of false and malicious information and to “make life easy for the common man and life trouble for spammers.” New Research Big Data: un aporte para la discusion de la politica publica en Colombia – Fundacion Karisma     Subscribe to the Netizen Report by email     Afef Abrougui, Ellery Roberts Biddle, Rezwan Islam, Kevin Rothrock, Nevin Thompson, Laura Vidal and Sarah Myers West contributed to this report.

A Google researcher publicly disclosed the bug in a blog post this week, which accompanied news from both Apple and Google that they’re patching devices in response. In his post and as detailed by Ars Technica, Gal Beniamini demonstrates how he exploited a Wi-Fi SoC manufactured by Broadcom to execute malicious code by solely being within the same Wi-Fi range of the targeted phone. No user interaction is required. This attack is slightly terrifying because the chipset hardware is baked into lots of phones, including the Nexus 5, 6, and 6P, as well as most Samsung flagship devices and all iPhones since the iPhone 4. On the bright side: Broadcom is being responsive to Beniamini and is working with him to mitigate the issue going forward. Apple also already patched the bug with the release of iOS 10.3.1 on Monday, and Google patched it in its April security release. The bad news, however, is that although Google has issued a fix, lots of Android devices fall behind regular patching schedules. More often than not, individual manufacturers or carriers have to push Android updates out over the air. This doesn’t happen as frequently as it should, which leaves device owners to hope no one targets their device in between the time it gets updated and when the bug is publicly disclosed. The only way to definitely receive all Android security updates is by sticking with Google’s phones, like the Pixel, or potentially unlocked Samsung devices, as the company says it’ll issue monthly updates in the future.

(Photo: Associated Press) Ten more families have joined a federal lawsuit blaming tech giants Google, Facebook and Twitter for the deaths of their loved ones following the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history last year. They joined the lawsuit filed initially by three other families in December that accuses the social media and technology companies of fostering Islamic radicalization in ISIS-inspired shooter Omar Mateen, which led to his terrorist attack of a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, according to an amended complaint filed Friday. The 29-year-old shooter had pledged his allegiance to ISIS during 911 calls he placed from within the nightclub.    It was through YouTube — a video platform owned by Google — and social media platforms Facebook and Twitter that the shooter was able to view terrorist propaganda put out by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria and thus draw inspiration for the killing of 49 people and wounding of more than 60 others on on June 12, 2016, the plaintiffs argue. “This material support has been instrumental to the rise of ISIS and has enabled it to carry out or cause to be carried out, numerous terrorist attacks,” the complaint reads. “Defendants are information content providers because they create unique content by combining ISIS postings with advertisements in a way that is specifically targeted at the viewer. Defendants share revenue with ISIS for its content and profit from ISIS postings through advertising revenue.” The complaint continues, arguing if it weren’t for these companies, ISIS would not enjoy the notoriety it holds today. Further, the platforms allowed ISIS to recruit western sympathizers like the Orlando shooter and provides instructions on how to commit acts of terror. ISIS releases the information in promotional videos the group calls “Mujatweets,” a play on the Arabic word Mujahideen, or one who engages in jihad. Shortly after the initial complaint was filed, Facebook released a statement, saying, “We are committed to providing a service where people feel safe when using Facebook. … We sympathize with the victims and their families.” Both Twitter and Google haven’t issued a statement regarding the lawsuit and neither could not be reached for comment. The defendants, in a 40-page motion to dismiss filed March 10, claim they aren’t to be held accountable for the actions of a man who the defendants never claimed viewed jihadist materials produced by ISIS specifically. “Defendants deeply sympathize with Plaintiffs’ losses and are committed to combating the spread of terrorist content online,” the motion reads. “Simply stated, there is no place on Defendants’ sites for those who seek to promote terrorist activity or disseminate terrorist content. But there is no legal basis for holding Defendants liable for the heinous acts at issue here.”  Filed Under: Crime, Politics & 2nd Amendment Share Tweet Mike in Illinois Am I the only one who finds this ummmm hilarious?

Hey google, hey twitter, do you see yet that this is the very kind of thing that your ummm CEO’s and that crowd SUPPORTS? Got Laundry? deer_slug Totally agree.

The TPU is a Tensor Processing Unit – to be compared to Intel’s CPU or NVIDIA’s GPU, made for processing data. Google’s news here is their first-ever study published on how well their TPU works – compared, appropriately enough, to Intel’s CPU and NVIDIA’s GPU whilst neural networking. A neural network is a computer system with functionality based on that of the human brain and nervous system. Neural networking is meant to allow computers to think and reason, and ultimately solve problems in ways that’ve only before been possible with the human brain. Google uses neural networks for a wide variety of applications. Saying “OK Google” followed by a question or request utilizes Google’s neural network computing technology. Google uses neural networking for machine learning as well – each time the computer solves a problem, it gets smarter. Each time the user confirms that the computer has solved a problem correctly, the computer gets more capable of finding answers that are correct. This is called Deep Learning. To solve the problem of increasing demand for neural networking capacity, Google worked on their own Tensor Processing Unit (TPU). Google’s TPU is processing hardware – an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). Google’s goal (starting in the year 2013), was to improve cost-performance for neural networking (in this case Deep Neural Networking) by 10x over GPUs. This is according to Google’s paper “In-Datacenter Performance Analysis of a Tensor Processing Unit”. Google’s TPU plugs into existing servers like a GPU does using the PCIe I/O bus. Google’s TPU is a coprocessor, one that is not tightly integrated with a CPU. Google’s development team says that because the host server sends instructions to the TPU rather than the TPU fetching them itself, the TPU is “closer in spirit to an FPU (floating-point unit) coprocessor than it is to a GPU.” Speaking with NextPlatform, Google hardware engineer Norman Jouppi suggested that Google looked at field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) before they decided on ASIC units. While FPGAs are easy to modify, they do not perform as well as ASICs. Google’s TPU seems to be the best of both worlds. “The TPU is programmable like a CPU or GPU,” said Jouppi. “It isn’t designed for just one neural network model; it executes CISC instructions on many networks (convolutional, LSTM models, and large, fully connected models). So it is still programmable, but uses a matrix as a primitive instead of a vector or scalar.” Google’s choices in hardware were done not to create the most efficient or powerful TPU possible. Instead, Google’s choices in hardware were to allow deployment at a massive scale. “It needs to be distributed—if you do a voice search on your phone in Singapore, it needs to happen in that datacenter—we need something cheap and low power,” said Jouppi. “Going to something like HBM (High Bandwidth Memory) for an inference chip might be a little extreme, but is a different story for training.” From the paper linked above, Google’s benchmarks show that Google’s TPU solution far outperformed comparable Intel Haswell CPU architecture with less power. Their tests showed their TPU process 92 TOPS (71x more throughput than Intel’s CPU on inferences) in a 384 watt thermal envelope for the server while busy. The Intel Haswell CPU processed 2.6 TOPS with a thermal envelope of 455 watts while busy. This is where Google’s entry into this neural networking processing hardware universe begins. Google’s TPU will be seeing a lot more play – and publicity – over the next several years if their efficiency continues to take on the top guns as it has in this first benchmarking study.

They can't tell that the guy standing behind them has just hacked their smartphones. Credit: Monkey Business Images/ShutterstockMore They can't tell that the guy standing behind them has just hacked their smartphones. Credit: Monkey Business Images/Shutterstock That’s not the case with a new vulnerability that affects the ubiquitous Broadcom mobile Wi-Fi chips. A very dedicated and skilled hacker could theoretically compromise any vulnerable phone logged into the same Wi-Fi network as the hacker. Apple devices are safe as long as they update to iOS 10.3.1, and Google Nexus and Pixel phones if they install this month's Android security patch (both released Monday), but most Android users will either have to wait a while, or develop other methods to protect themselves. Vulnerable phones include Google's Nexus 5, 6 and 6P, most high-end Samsung phones, and every iPhone since the iPhone 4. While some of these devices (such as the iPhone 5 and later and the Nexus 6 and later) can already be patched, other Android devices — particularly Samsung's, but likely other manufacturers' as well — remain vulnerable for now, and many will never be patched. MORE: Best Android Antivirus Software and Apps What To Do First and foremost: To protect yourself from this flaw, ensure that you have the latest system software installed on your phone. Supported Apple and Nexus phones can already receive the patches, but their owners will have to authorize the updates. If you've got an iPhone 4 or 4s or a Nexus 5 , you're out of luck — as those handsets are no longer supported, they will almost certainly never receive this patch. (Google did not list the Nexus 5X, which is still supported, as eligible for the patch. We've heard that that handset uses a Qualcomm rather than a Broadcom Wi-Fi chipset, so it may not be affected by this flaw. We're asking Google for more information.) Other handset manufacturers will be scrambling to release patches. When those patches are ready, simply downloading and installing the updates should be enough to head this vulnerability off at the pass. However, if you have a phone that doesn’t run stock Android, then you’re probably reliant on your wireless carrier for security updates, and wireless carriers tend to drag their heels — not least because they have to work out the kinks for each and every Android patch with each handset manufacturer that they buy devices from. And if your Android phone is more than 2 years old, it's unlikely that you'll receive a patch this flaw. In that case, the simplest way to protect yourself is to disable Wi-Fi whenever you're not on a known network. Using your home or office Wi-Fi is probably not dangerous, since they're probably secured with a password and (at least in theory) you know everyone using them. Some phones can be set up so that Wi-Fi automatically switches off when you get out of range of a specific network. The real danger comes from unsecured or public Wi-Fi networks, which can be used as part of an old hacker trick. If a malicious Wi-Fi hotspot has a commonly used network name — such as "LINKSYS", or "ATT Free Wi-Fi" — your phone will automatically connect to it as long as the phone has connected to a network with the same name in the past. Once you're connected, a hacker could exploit the Broadcom vulnerability and take over your phone completely. Read More To avoid unsecured Wi-Fi networks (which provide a whole host of problems beyond just proof-of-concept Broadcom flaws), access your Wi-Fi settings and selected Saved Networks. Then, instruct your phone to Forget anything that’s not a private, secured, known network that you use on a daily basis. How It Works The potentially devastating flaw was explained by Gal Beniamini, a researcher at Google’s Project Zero security initiative. In a blog posting yesterday (April 4), Beniamini describes, in exhaustive detail, how almost any phone with a Broadcom Wi-Fi chip could be compromised by his intricate exploit, and made to run malicious code. The Broadcom vulnerability itself requires fairly deep knowledge of Wi-Fi chipsets to understand, let alone replicate. Still, in simple terms, Beniamini developed a way to attack the firmware on Broadcom's system-on-chip Wi-Fi.  Beniamini caused a stack buffer overflow, meaning he was able to make the chip try to record information in excess of its allotted memory. By transmitting data to the chip and arbitrarily rewriting values, he was able to take over the device’s RAM piece-by-piece, until he had enough computing power at his disposal to execute remote code. If that sounds like a gross oversimplification, it is; the first of two blog posts explaining the process is almost 9,000 words long. Still, if Beniamini could do it, there’s likely at least one cybercriminal out there who could, too. Beniamini had harsh words for Broadcom, claiming that its chip "lacks all basic exploit mitigations." Broadcom told Beniamini that its future chips will provide more security, both in terms of hardware and firmware. In the meantime, it'll be up to phone manufacturers and wireless carriers to keep users safe — something that, apart from Apple and Google, they have a decidedly mixed record of doing.

Google’s online package of about 40 television channels debuts on Wednesday, April 5, 2017, in the tech industry’s latest bid to get cable-shunning millennials to pay for television. (AP Photo/Reed Saxon, File) New York — YouTube TV, Google's new streaming package of about 40 television channels, is the tech industry's latest bid to get cable-shunning millennials to pay for live TV over the internet. It offers intriguing advantages over rivals, but it remains hobbled by a limited channel selection. Don't confuse the YouTube service, which debuts Wednesday, with Netflix, Amazon Prime and other streaming offerings. Like similar efforts from Sony, Dish and AT&T's DirecTV , YouTube TV primarily aims to let you channel surf over the internet, not to stream from an online library of shows and movies. So these internet-cable services can offer live programming, especially sports. But they also come with some serious drawbacks. While these services are typically cheaper than traditional cable or satellite services, people haven't been signing up in droves. Google is targeting viewers who have never subscribed to cable or satellite TV and are just as happy to get all their video from the internet; getting them to cough up $35 a month could be a hard sell. Google aims to lure subscribers with more sophisticated program search, personalized recommendations and a more fully featured online DVR than rival services offer. But it faces many of the limitations its rivals have. YouTube TV, for instance, features staples such as ESPN and major broadcast networks, but lacks key networks such as PBS, CNN and Comedy Central. And it will initially be only available in a handful of major U.S. cities because media rights are still stuck in the 20th century . ___ WHAT YOU GET ... AND WHAT YOU DON'T YouTube TV offers plenty of live sports, one of the chief reasons people stick with cable. Pick a team, and the service automatically records all the televised games it can find. Available channels include ESPN, Big Ten and sports networks from Comcast, Fox and CBS — but not Turner networks such as TBS and others that aired the bulk of March Madness. New York Mets fans won't get baseball games on SNY. YouTube also has the youth-oriented Freeform and CW networks; its rivals lack The CW. AMC is coming in a few weeks, so you'll have to wait to catch up on the just-ended season of "The Walking Dead." Since most channel numbers and names are meaningless in a digital world, YouTube TV arranges live channels by topic, starting with broadcast networks, sports, youth-oriented channels, then everything else. Subscriptions are initially limited to New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia and the San Francisco Bay Area — all locations where YouTube could get rights to local ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC stations. ___ SEARCH PARTY As you'd expect from Google, search is one of YouTube's big selling points. Its rivals already offer search by shows and sometimes by actors; YouTube adds topical searches, such as "aliens" or "road trips." Unfortunately, it's still a work in progress. A search for "nerd comedy" brings up "The Big Bang Theory," but "comedy about nerds" does not. And a search for "Modern Family episode on basketball" doesn't bring up the episode titled "Basketball." YouTube could also stand to take a cue from TiVo recorders and let you automatically record all programs featuring, say, Jennifer Lawrence, including her talk-show appearances. You can search for Jennifer Lawrence, but you need to go through the results and choose shows to record individually — too much work for a service that promises simplicity. One big plus: YouTube's unlimited DVR will store recordings for nine months, long enough for entire seasons of network shows. Sony's PlayStation Vue — the only similar service offering an unlimited online DVR — offers only 28 days of storage, nowhere near enough for binge-watching.

Republican John Thune of South Dakota, chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, and Democrat Gary Peters of Michigan, said they're exploring legislation that "clears hurdles and advances innovation in self-driving vehicle technology." The senators' counterparts in the House are also gearing up to address the new technology, with a hearing scheduled for Tuesday. Automakers cite federal requirements that all vehicles must have steering wheels and brake pedals as examples of regulations that presume there will be a human driver and might inhibit the introduction of self-driving cars. Congressional action may be needed to make changes. "Without changes to those regulations, it may be years before the promise of today's technology can be realized and thousands of preventable deaths that could have been avoided will happen," Michael Ableson, General Motors' vice president of global strategy, plans to tell the House Energy and Commerce Committee, according to prepared testimony. Proponents of self-driving cars say they hold the potential to dramatically reduce traffic deaths by eliminating human error, which the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says is a factor in 94 percent of all fatal crashes. More than 35,000 people were killed on the nation's roads in 2015, up over 7 percent from the previous year. Traffic deaths surged an additional 8 percent in the first nine months of last year. Automakers also say that states are moving ahead with their own regulations, creating the potential for a confusing "patchwork" of laws. "Our effort will also include a discussion on the existing patchwork of laws and regulations and the traditional roles of federal and state regulators," Thune and Peters said in a joint statement. Safety advocates have urged the government to set standards that specifically address the safety of self-driving cars. The Obama administration last year issued a voluntary set of safety goals for makers of self-driving cars to meet with the understanding that enforceable regulations could follow. The Trump administration hasn't yet indicated what approach it will take to the technology. Some people may first experience riding in a self-driving car by hailing an on-demand, ride-sharing service like Uber or Lyft. Uber began offering passengers rides in autonomous cars with a human as a backup driver last year in Pittsburgh. Joseph Okpaku, Lyft's vice president of government relations, says in prepared testimony for the House hearing that the company's goal is "to operate a pilot in a major city this year that will permit consumers to enjoy, for the first time, a Lyft in an autonomous vehicle." Tech crawl: Passenger-carrying drones and new features from Google Maps Published: Monday, February 13, 2017 @ 11:02 AM By: American-Statesman Staff The EHang 184 autonomous aerial vehicle is desplayed at the EHang booth at CES International in Las Vegas. (John Locher/Associated Press) John Locher/Associated Press Happy Monday, Austin. Hope your weekend was a good one. As you settle into the work week, here’s a look at some of the technology stories building a buzz around the Interwebs this morning: Passenger carrying drones? Yes, please! In Dubai, government leaders have an idea for battling traffic jams: a passenger-carrying drone.  Yes, seriously. Dubai officials say they hope to have the passenger-carrying drone -- which is a Chinese-made device known as the EHang 184 -- buzzing through the skyline of the city-state as soon as July. The craft can carry a passenger weighing up to 100 kilograms (220 pounds) and a small suitcase. After buckling into its race-car-style seat, the craft's sole passenger selects a destination on a touch-screen pad in front of the seat and the drone flies there automatically. It’s hard to know if the egg-shaped, four-legged craft will really take off as a transportation alternative in this car-clogged city. "This is not only a model," said Mattar al-Tayer, head of Dubai's Roads & Transportation Agency. "We have actually experimented with this vehicle flying in Dubai's skies.” Here’s hoping it works. And that we can get a fleet of them for Austin. New features for Google Maps Google Maps is rolling out a new feature that lets you create Spotify-like "playlists" of favorite local spots on Google Maps that you can then share with friends. The idea is, obviously, pretty similar to Foursquare, but with Google’s size and reach,  the idea is a huge network of lists can be created that gives users "a speed-dial-like network of places if you're trying to figure out where to dine or visit on short notice," Engadget writes.  TechCrunch and The Verge also weigh in on the new Google feature and its possible uses, with The Verge piece wondering if Google Maps is trying to step into the social network space. New tech might mean better Wi-Fi We’d all like better, more consistent Wi-Fi networks, right? Well, Qualcomm on Monday rolled out some new technology that some tech experts say could make your home Wi-Fi a lot better. Mashable’s Raymond Wong has a piece on how the new Qualcomm tech works, and what it might mean for you. Spotify helps listeners cook turkey with Thanksgiving-themed playlists Published: Tuesday, November 22, 2016 @ 3:09 PM By: Jackie Wang (Spotify) Spotify Spotify wants to help you cook your Thanksgiving turkey just right. Time for Turkey, the streaming service's holiday-specific program,  gives users three steps for a perfectly-done turkey: provide the turkey's weight, choose what genre of music you'd like to listen to, and enjoy. Genres include Americana, "Family Time," "Feeling Thankful," "Club Kitchen," "Freshly Baked" and "Golden Oldies." Each themed playlist name works off of the genre. For example,  the "Freshly Baked" playlist brings out the newest hits for you to enjoy some never-tasted-before singles. "Family Time" includes songs that every generation can enjoy, such as "I'm A Believer" by the Monkees or "Riptide" by Vance Joy. Unfortunately, none of the playlists include the classic Thanksgiving songs of Bob's Burgers, including one of the best Thanksgiving song collaboration of all time. While the songs themselves may not be Thanksgiving-themed, the variety of turkey accompaniment that Spotify has provided contributes so much to the dinner process. Even if only for timing purposes, Time for Turkey will add to your Thanksgiving feast. In an age where we see Christmas advertisements earlier and earlier each year, this feels like a good way for a company to give Thanksgiving a nod of acknowledgment. Helmet for treating depression being used in Austin Published: Thursday, June 30, 2016 @ 2:51 PM Updated: Wednesday, June 29, 2016 @ 5:18 PM By: Omar L. Gallaga - American-Statesman Staff Danny Pyka, a patient at Senior Adult Specialty Healthcare, is fitted with a helmet from Brainsway Ltd. on Tuesday, June 28, 2016, which is used for treatment of major depression. Pyka says he noticed immediate improvement the same week he started treatments.(Omar L. Gallaga) Omar L. Gallaga Danny Pyka, an Austinite who worked for Mercedes-Benz for about 10 years, had been suffering from depression for so long and so severely that he was certain his suicidal thoughts would eventually lead to the end of his life. "It was just miserable," said Pyka, who found work as a handyman, but found it difficult to have a normal life or relationships with his wife and 18-year-old daughter not affected by his condition. "I was secluding myself... I'd close the house off and just sleep pretty much the whole day." Many attempts at medicating the problem over 10 to 15 years failed. He heard through a friend that studies were being done on a new technology, Deep TMS, or Deep Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, from a New Jersey and Tel Aviv-based company called Brainsway. Pyka was able to get the treatment in Austin and says he noticed an improvement after the first week of about nine weeks of treatments. "The suicidal thoughts were ruminating thoughts that affected me throughout my daily life. After the first week and so on, they just dissipated. I'm very fortunate and very happy that it worked for me," Pyka said. This Deep TMS (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation) machine is being used to treat depression. Different versions of it are also currently being tested for other kinds of treatment.(Contributed by Brainsway Ltd.) Contributed by Brainsway Ltd. Pyka had the treatment done at Senior Adults Speciality Healthcare in Northwest Austin, which has been working with TMS technology for about two and a half years. TMS works through a mounted helmet that generates an electrical pulse, not unlike the technology in an MRI. Patients cycle through two-second pulses followed by 20 seconds of rest for each sequence, called a "Train," and it's repeated for about 20 minutes. Treatments are done daily for about six weeks, followed by a three week tapering off period. Different patients may require a different power intensity depending on each patient's motor threshold, the number of sequences is the same for all patience. The pulses for this particular treatment (there are others being tested for other afflictions) target the primary motor cortex. The low-level electrical charge affects mood regulation, retraining the nervous system to work correctly. Dr. Jaron Winston says that unlike electroconvulsive treatment, or shock treatment, which can have severe side effects, TMS has proven for many of his patients to be the a less invasive treatment for chronic depression that works more effectively than medication. "About 60 percent of patients (within our clinic) go into total remission of their depression; 60 to 70 percent had significant reduction of depressive symptoms," Winston said. Clinical studies of the technology since its FDA approval for treating depression in 2008 have bolstered the view that it can be effective for some who have not gotten results from medication or for those who've relapsed into depression,. The National Institute of Mental Health has funded studies into the technology, which lists it on its website alongside electroconsulsive therapy. The American Psychiatric Association includes TMS in its 2010 guidelines for treating major depressive disorders  and the organization says it will be updating those guidelines soon with more recent research. Winston said that patients can experience some minor pain from the pulse as nerves on the scalp are stimulated, but that it typically goes away, which Pyka said was his experience. "It feels like somebody thumping on the right side of your head for the amount of seconds" the machine runs, Pyka said. But by the third or fourth treatment, he said, "it gets more simple to do. I’ve honestly nodded off a couple of times in the chair. You get used to it." In the U.S., Deep TMS is only FDA-approved for use in treating depression, and Winston says that insurance typically won't cover followup maintenance appointments or the treatment itself unless medications have used and failed to treat the depression.  Off-label treatments being tested using other versions of the technology could help treat post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, bipolar depression and even smoking addiction by stimulating other parts of the brain. Winston said that many potential patients and even some doctors and psychiatrists are unaware that the technology exists and is available, particularly for people who aren't responding to medication.  "It's another treatment to help make (patients) functional again, to make them come out of their depression and withdrawal states," Winston said. "As treatment goes by, they will say they've never felt this well, their thinking is clearer, their cognition is better, than can focus, their mood is better, sleep is better. But there's still people who don't know anything about it." Pyka, who has completed treatment with Deep TMS, says he's been more productive and is now able to enjoy watching his daughter grow up without taking five or six medications a day (he only takes medication for sleep issues now).  The crying and worrying, he says, has subsided. "It's been a life-changing experience."

Fast Forward Labs@HumeKathryn April 5, 2017 2:10 PM Tags: ai, artificial intelligence, bots, chatbots, conversational interfaces, distractions, end of work, existential risk, job loss, jobs, personhood, UBI, universal basic income One of the main arguments the Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari makes in Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind is that humans differ from other species because we can cooperate flexibly in large numbers, united in cause and spirit not by anything real, but by the fictions of our collective imagination. Examples of these fictions include gods, nations, money, and human rights, which are supported by religions, political structures, trade networks, and legal institutions, respectively. As an entrepreneur, I’m increasingly appreciative of and fascinated by the power of collective fictions. Building a technology company is hard. Incredibly hard. Lost deals, fragile egos, impulsive choices, bugs in the code, missed deadlines, frantic sprints to deliver on customer requests, the doldrums of execution: Any number of things can temper the initial excitement of starting a new venture. Mission is another fiction required to keep a team united and driven when the proverbial shit hits the fan. While a strong, charismatic group of leaders is key to establishing and sustaining a company mission, companies don’t exist in a vacuum — they exist in a market, and they participate in the larger collective fictions of the zeitgeist in which they operate. The borders are fluid and porous, and leadership can use this porousness to energize a team to feel like they’re on the right track, like they’re fighting the right battle at the right time. These days, it is incredibly energizing to work for a company building software products with artificial intelligence (AI). AI is shorthand for products that use data to provide a service or insight to a user — or, as I argued in a previous post, AI is whatever computers cannot do until they can. But there wouldn’t be so much frenzied fervor around AI if it were as boring as building a product using statistics and data. Rather, what’s exciting the public are the collective fictions we’re building around what AI means — or could mean, or should mean — for society. It all becomes a lot more thrilling when we think about AI as computers doing things we’ve always thought only humans can do: when they start to speak, write, or even create art like we do, or when we no longer have to adulterate and contort our thoughts and language to speak Google or Excel. The problem is that some of our collective fictions about AI, exciting though they may be, are distracting us from the real problems AI can and should be used to solve, as well as some of the real problems AI is creating and will only exacerbate if we’re not careful. In this post, I cover my top five distractions in contemporary public discourse around AI. Distraction 1: The end of work Anytime he hears rumblings that AI is going to replace the workforce as we know it, my father, who has 40 years of experience in software engineering, most recently in natural language processing and machine learning, placidly mentions Desk Set, a 1957 romantic comedy featuring Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn. Desk Set features a group of librarians at a national broadcasting network who fear for their jobs when an engineer is brought in to install EMERAC (named after IBM’s ENIAC), an “electronic brain” that promises to do a better job fielding consumer trivia questions than they do. The film is both charming and prescient, and will seem very familiar to anyone reading about a world without work. The best scene features a virtuoso feat of associative memory showing the sheer brilliance of the character played by Katharine Hepburn (winning Tracy’s heart in the process), a brilliance the primitive electronic brain would have no chance of emulating. The movie ends with a literal deus ex machina where a machine accidentally prints pink slips to fire the entire company, only to get shut down due to its rogue disruption of operations. Desk Set can teach us a lesson. The 1950s saw the rise of energy around AI. In 1952, Bell Labs’ Claude Shannon introduced Theseus, a maze-solving artificial mouse. In 1957, Frank Rosenblatt built his Mark I Perceptron, the grandfather of today’s neural networks. In 1958, H.P. Luhn wrote a groundbreaking paper about business intelligence that proposes an information management system we’re still working to make possible today. And Arthur Samuel coined the term “machine learning” upon release of his checkers-playing program in 1959 (Tom Mitchell has my favorite contemporary manifesto on what machine learning is and means). The world was buzzing with excitement. Society was to be totally transformed. Work would end, or at least fundamentally change to feature collaboration with intelligent machines. This didn’t happen. We hit an AI winter. Deep learning was ridiculed as useless. Technology went on to change how we work and live, but not as the AI luminaries in the 1950s thought. Many new jobs were created. And no one in 1950 pictured a Bay Area full of silicon transistors and adolescent engineers making millions off mobile apps. No one imagined Mark Zuckerberg. No one imagined Peter Thiel. We need to ask different questions and address different people and process challenges to make AI work in the enterprise. I’ve seen the capabilities of over 100 large enterprises over the past two years, and I can tell you we have a long way to go before smart machines outright replace people. AI products, based on data and statistics, produce probabilistic outputs whose accuracy and performance improve with exposure to more data over time. As cognitive scientist Amos Tversky said, “man is a deterministic device thrown into a probabilistic universe.” People mistake correlation for cause. They prefer deterministic, clear instructions to uncertainties and confidence rates (I adore the first few paragraphs of this article, where Obama throws his hands up in despair after being briefed on the likely location of Osama bin Laden in 2011). Maura Grossman and Gordon Cormack have spent years marshaling evidence to show humans are not as thorough as they think, especially with the large volumes of electronic information we process today. Law firm risk departments, as Intapp CEO John Hall says, struggle immensely to break the conditioning of painstaking review to identify a conflict or potential piece of evidence. These habits must be broken to take advantage of the efficiencies AI can provide. The moral of the story is, before we start pontificating about the end of work, we should start thinking about how to update our mental habits to get comfortable with probabilities and statistics. This requires training. It requires that senior management make decisions about their risk tolerance for uncertainty. It requires that management decide where transparency is necessary (situations where we need to know why the algorithm gave the answer it did, as in consumer credit) and where accuracy and speed are more important (as in self-driving cars, where it’s critical to make the right decision to save lives and less important that we know why a decision was made). It requires the art of figuring out where to put a human in the loop to bootstrap the data required for future automation. It requires a lot of work, and it’s creating new consulting and product management jobs to address the new AI workplace. Distraction 2: Conversational interfaces Just about everyone can talk; very few people have something truly meaningful and interesting to say. The same holds for chatbots, software systems whose front end is designed to engage with an end user as if it were another human in conversation. Conversational AI is extremely popular these days for customer service workflows (a next-generation version of recorded options menus for airline, insurance, banking, or utilities companies) or even booking appointments at the hair salon or yoga studio. The principles behind conversational AI are great: It makes technology more friendly, enables technophobes like my grandmother to benefit from internet services by shouting requests to her Amazon Alexa, and promises immense efficiencies for businesses that serve large consumer bases by automating and improving customer service (which, despite my first point about the end of work, will likely impact service departments significantly). The problem, however, is that people get so caught up in the excitement of building a smart bot that they forget that being able to talk doesn’t mean you have anything useful or intelligent to say. Indeed, at Fast Forward Labs, we’ve encountered many startups so hyped by the promise of conversational AI that they neglect the less sexy but incontrovertibly more important backend work of building the intelligence that powers a useful front end experience. This work includes collecting, cleaning, processing, and storing data that can be used to train the bot. Scoping and understanding the domain of questions you’d like to have your bot answer. Creating recommendation algorithms to align service to customer if needed. Designing for privacy. Building out workflow capabilities to escalate to a human in the case of customer confusion. And so on, and so on. The more general point I’m making with this example is that AI is not magic. These systems are still early in their development and adoption, and very few off-the-shelf capabilities exist. In an early adopter phase, we’re still experimenting, still figuring out bespoke solutions on particular data sets, still restricting scope so we can build something useful that may not be nearly as exciting as our imagination desires. When she gives talks about the power of data, my colleague Hilary Mason frequently references Google Maps as a paradigmatic data product. Why? Because it’s boring! The front end is meticulously designed to provide a useful, simple service, hiding the immense complexity and hard work that powers the application behind the scenes. In short, conversation and language are not always the best way to present information. The best AI applications will come from designers who use judgment to interweave text, speech, image, and navigation through keys and buttons. Distraction 3: Universal basic income Universal basic income (UBI), a government program where everyone, at every income level in society, receives a stipend on a regular basis — Andy Stern, author of Raising the Floor, suggests $1,000 per month per U.S. citizen — is a corollary of the world without work. UBI is interesting because it unites libertarians (be they technocrats in Silicon Valley or hyper-conservatives like Charles Murray, who envisions a Jeffersonian ideal of neighbors supporting neighbors with autonomy and dignity) with socialist progressives (Andy Stern is a true man of the people, who led the Service Employee International Union for years) and futurists like Peter Diamandis. However, UBI is a distraction from a much more profound economic problem being created by our current global, technology-driven economy: income inequality. We all know this is the root cause of Trumpism, Brexit, and many of the other nationalist, regressive political movements at play across the world today. It is critical we address it. Income inequality is not a simple issue. It involves a complex interplay of globalization, technology, government programs, education, the stigma of vocational schools in the US, etc. In the Seventh Sense, Joshua Cooper Ramo explains how network infrastructure leads to polarizing effects, concentrating massive power in the hands of a few (Google, Facebook, Amazon, Uber) and distributing micro power and expression to the many (the millions connected on these platforms). Nicholas Bloom covers similar ground in this HBR article about corporations in the age of inequality. The economic consequences of our networked world can be dire, and they must be checked by thinking and approaches that did not exist in the 20th century. Returning to mercantilism and protectionism is not a solution. It’s a salve that can only lead to violence. That said, one argument for UBI my heart cannot help but accept is that it can restore dignity and opportunity for the poor. Imagine if, to eat, you had to wait in lines at food pantries and could only afford unhealthy food that promotes obesity and diabetes. Imagine how much time you would waste in government offices, and how that time could be better spent to learn a new skill or create a new idea! The 2016 film I, Daniel Blake is a must see. It’s one of those movies that brings tears to my eyes just thinking of it. You watch a kind, hard-working, honest man go through the wringer of a bureaucratic system, pushed to the limits of his dignity before he eventually rebels. While UBI may not be the answer, we all have a moral obligation to empathize with those who might not share our political views. People who are scared and want a better life also have truths to tell. Distraction 4: Existential risk Enlightenment is man’s emergence from his self-imposed nonage. Nonage is the inability to use one’s own understanding without another’s guidance. This nonage is self-imposed if its cause lies not in lack of understanding but in indecision and lack of courage to use one’s own mind without another’s guidance. Dare to know! (Sapere aude.) “Have the courage to use your own understanding,” is therefore the motto of the enlightenment. This is the first paragraph of Immanuel Kant’s 1784 essay “Answering the Question: What Is Enlightenment?“. I cite it because contemporary discourse about AI becoming an existential threat reminds me of the Middle Ages, when philosophers like Thomas Aquinas and Wilhelm von Ockham presented arguments on the basis of authority: “This is true because Aristotle once said that…” Descartes, Luther, Diderot, Galileo, and the other powerhouses of the Enlightenment thought this was rubbish and led to all sorts of confusion. They toppled the old guard and placed authority in the individual, each and every one of us born with the same rational capabilities to build arguments and arrive at conclusions. Such radical self-reliance has waxed and waned throughout history, the Enlightenment offset by the pulsing passion of Romanticism, only to be resurrected in the more atavistic rationality of Thoreau or Emerson. It seems that the current pace of change in technology and society is tipping the scales back towards dependence and guidance. It’s so damn hard to keep up with everything that we can’t help but relinquish judgment to the experts. Which means that if Bill Gates, Stephen Hawking, and Elon Musk, the priests of engineering, science, and ruthless entrepreneurship, all think that AI is a threat to the human race, then we mere mortals may as well bow down to their authority. The problem here is that the chicken-little logic espoused by the likes of Nick Bostrom, which urges us to prepare for the worst of all possible outcomes, distracts us from the real social issues AI is already exacerbating. An alternative approach to the ethics of AI, however, is quickly gaining traction. The Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency in Machine Learning movement focuses not on rogue machines going amok (another old idea, this time from Goethe’s 1797 poem “The Sorcerer’s Apprentice”), but on understanding how algorithms perpetuate and amplify existing social biases and doing something to change that. There’s strong literature focused on the practical ethics of AI. A current Fast Forward Labs intern just published a post about a tool called FairML, which he used to examine implicit racial bias in criminal sentencing algorithms. Mathematician Cathy O’Neil regularly writes articles about the evils of technology for Bloomberg (her rhetoric can be alienating to technologists and pragmatic moderates). Gideon Mann, who leads data science for Bloomberg, is working on a Hippocratic oath for data scientists. Software engineer Blaise Agüera y Arcas and his machine intelligence team at Google are constantly examining and correcting for potential bias creeping into their algorithms. Data scientist Clare Corthell is mobilizing practitioners in San Francisco to discuss and develop ethical data science practices. The list goes on. Designing ethical algorithms will be a marathon, not a sprint. Executive leadership at large enterprise organizations are just wrapping their heads around the financial potential of AI. Ethics is not their first concern. I predict the dynamics will resemble those in information security, where fear of a tarred reputation spurs corporations to act. Distraction 5: Personhood The language used to talk about AI and the design efforts made to make AI feel human and real invite anthropomorphism. In November, I spoke on a panel at a conference Google’s Artists and Machine Intelligence group hosted in Paris. It was a unique event because it brought together highly technical engineers and highly non-technical artists, which was a wonderful way to see how people who don’t work in machine learning understand, interpret, and respond to the language and metaphors engineers use to describe the vectors and linear algebra powering their machines. Sometimes this is productive: Artists like Ross Goodwin and Kyle McDonald deliberately play with the idea of relinquishing autonomy to a machine, liberating the human artist from the burden of choice and control, and opening the potential for serendipity as a network shuffles the traces of prior human work to create something radical, strange, and new. Sometimes this is not productive: One participant, upon learning that Deep Dream is actually an effort to interpret the black box impenetrability of neural networks, asked if AI might usher a new wave of Freudian psychoanalysis. (This stuff tries my patience.) It’s up for debate whether artists can derive more creativity from viewing an AI as an autonomous partner or an instrument whose pegs can be tuned like the strings of a guitar to change the outcome of the performance. I think both means of understanding the technology are valid, but ultimately produce different results. The general point here is that how we speak about AI changes what we think it is and what we think it can or can’t do. Our ability to anthropomorphize matrices multiplying numbers as determined by some function is worthy of wonder. But I can’t help but furrow my brow when I read about robots having rights like humans and animals. This would all be fine if it were only the path to consumer adoption, but these ideas of personhood may have legal consequences for consumer privacy rights. For example, courts are currently assessing whether the police have the right to information about a potential murder collected from Amazon Echo (privacy precedent here comes from Katz v. United States, the grandfather case in adapting the Fourth Amendment to our new digital age). Joanna Bryson, a computer scientist at the University of Bath and Princeton, has proposed one of the more interesting explanations for why it doesn’t make legal sense to imbue AI with personhood: “AI cannot be a legal person because suffering in well-designed AI is incoherent.” Suffering, says Bryson, is integral to our intelligence as social species. The crux of her argument is that we humans understand ourselves not as discrete monads or brains in a vat, but as essentially and intrinsically intertwined with other humans around us. We play by social rules, and avoid behaviors that lead to ostracism and alienation from the groups we are part of. We can construct what appears to be an empathetic response in robots, but we cannot construct a self-conscious, self-aware being who exercises choice and autonomy to pursue reward and recognition while avoiding suffering. (Perhaps reinforcement learning can get us there: I’m open to being convinced.) This argument goes much deeper than business articles arguing that work requiring emotional intelligence — such as sales, customer relationships, nursing, and education — will be more valued than quantitative and repetitive work in the future. It’s an incredibly exciting lens through which to understand our own morality and psychology. Conclusion As mentioned at the beginning of this post, collective fictions are the driving force of group alignment and activity. They are powerful, beautiful, the stuff of passion and motivation and awe. The fictions we create about the potential of AI may just be the catalyst to drive real impact throughout society. That’s nothing short of amazing, as long as we can step back and make sure we don’t forget the hard work required to realize these visions — and the risks we have to address along the way.

To put exact figures to that claim: Uber’s self-driving vehicles apparently experienced a disengagement once every mile or so (yes, once every ~1 mile). This compares to a disengagement rate of around once every 5,128 miles for Waymo’s (Google’s) self-driving vehicles. Waymo is apparently far and away the leader as far as California’s statistics go. Uber’s disengagement rate is pretty amazing considering that the company performed a total of 20,354 miles of testing in the state before being banned. I suppose that the state of the company’s tech is likely one of the reasons it didn’t want to go the official route in California as regards testing — bad PR. By comparison, Waymo has performed more than 500,000 miles of self-driving vehicle testing in California over the last year. The Guardian provides more: “Between Uber and Waymo sits Nissan, with one disengagement every 146 miles and a total of 4,099 miles driven. BMW, Tesla, and Mercedes all also beat Uber’s disengagement rate, although none of the 3 firms have filed more than 1,000 miles of testing in the last 12 months. … “The figures shed new light on the ongoing lawsuit between Waymo and Uber. The latter company is accused of stealing intellectual property after it acquired a self-driving truck company, Otto, which had been founded by Anthony Levandowski, a former Waymo employee. The technology in question is the design of the lidar array, the light-based imaging system that sits on the top of self-driving cars to help them see the world around them.” In other words, even if Waymo couldn’t block Uber’s use of what seems to be Waymo tech that Levandowski lifted (presumably, because he thought he had a right to it?), Uber apparently has a lot of catching up to do in order to get to the self-driving levels Waymo and others are at. The analyst at Edison Investment Research that compiled the comparison being discussed, Richard Windsor, commented: “Google is 5,000 times better than Uber at autonomous driving. Although Google is suing Uber for the alleged theft of its lidar design, it does not seem to have helped Uber much as it appears to be by far the worst at autonomous driving. This is still the case when one includes the regular car companies that most people have written off as having very little to offer in the new world of digital and autonomous cars.” Windsor continued: “The best measure of an autonomous driving solution is how often the driver has to take over to correct shortcomings in the autonomous driving software. Regulations in California require those that test in the state to submit this data but typically, they all submit it in different ways. There are also different types of disengagement such as when the car is going to hit something (critical) or when the safety driver feels uncomfortable (ordinary). Furthermore, companies test their cars in different conditions, meaning the data can really only be used as indication. However, the contrasts are so stark that we think that meaningful conclusions can be drawn about how advanced the autonomous driving solutions from different players really are.” Those are very good points. While the figures for the different companies aren’t directly comparable (if one is to be honest/accurate), the vast disparity between Waymo and Uber is striking. Waymo certainly appears to be far closer to being market ready.

Don't Change Your Google Password Before Factory Resetting Your Android Phone - You Might Trip A 72-Hour Security Lockout David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2015/07/13 3:19pm PDTJul 13, 2015 642 Plus 1 on G+ 726 Share on Facebook 6 Share on Twitter Total Shares1374 Android OS Tips & Tutorials Article Contents 1 Why am I locked out of my phone for 72 hours? 2 Why is this a feature?

This isn't a news story, but more of a "public service announcement" about an Android feature not everyone may be aware of. If you've ended up here because your Android phone is telling you that, after a factory reset, you cannot log into your device for 72 hours (3 days), I don't have much good news: you're going to have to wait it out. If you want to know why exactly this happens, regardless of whether or not it has affected you, this post will at least show you how to avoid falling victim to this security measure again if you find it to be too much trouble, as well as why this feature exists to begin with. Why am I locked out of my phone for 72 hours? Back in March 2015, Google introduced a feature called Device Protection in its newly-released version of Android, 5.1 Lollipop. Part of this new suite of security tools was something called Factory Reset Protection. This is the source of the 72-hour device lockout. It is tripped by resetting your Google account password and then performing a factory reset on an Android device (with Device Protection, meaning it runs 5.1+) that account is connected to. This feature is designed to allow you time to regain control of your Google account in the event it is compromised because your phone was stolen. Think of it this way: if somebody changes the lock on a security door (your phone) the night before the building gets robbed, do you think the person changing the lock (or someone else at the lock company) might have been in on it? That's essentially the logic of factory reset protection. The idea is that your Google account and password are the "lock" and "key" that are required to open your Factory Reset Protection-enabled device (the door) after it undergoes a factory reset, and that by changing your Google account password, you're "tampering" with the lock right before you enter the door - which is suspicious. And so at that point, Google initiates a 72-hour hold on sign-ins to that "door." After that 72 hours expires, you still need to log in with the previously-connected Google account's password. The difference is that during the hold, you just can't log in at all - after the hold is over, you obviously still need to verify the account password. Why is this a feature? Isn't this insane overkill? The reason the hold is triggered is that, once your Google account is compromised on a stolen phone (easy enough to do - the thief has your Gmail and probably your phone number), there is essentially no other way to stop a thief from successfully erasing all traces of your account ever having been on said phone, since a wipe can be done directly from the recovery menu on bootup without any sort of authorization (PIN/pattern protected startup does not prevent this). That 72 hours theoretically gives you time to get your Google account back under your control and change the password again, making the thief's attempts to log in futile. If you're wondering why a thief would know your Google account password and not your PIN/pattern lock, that's actually more likely to happen than you might think: it's completely possible to reset your Google account password without knowing the current one if you've got somebody's smartphone. Two-factor authentication generally relies on SMS, so the thief would get the authenticator on your stolen phone, and you probably would also have your backup email account synced to that smartphone as well (which, hey, good personal security idea: don't put your backup account on your phone). Generally speaking, it is comparatively much, much harder to change the lock screen on a phone if you don't know the existing PIN, pattern, or password, and short of social engineering or plain luck, that's hard information to get. Is there any way around factory reset protection once it's triggered? Sadly, no. Once the protection system is tripped, you've got a functionally useless smartphone until that 3-day lockout expires. If you've been locked out of your device and are looking for a workaround, sorry: there isn't one that we're aware of. You're going to have to wait (you also cannot sign in to the phone using another account - this would kind of defeat the purpose of the feature). Those affected by this problem have confirmed Google support is of no help in the matter - they'll just tell you to wait out the timer, during which time your phone has all the utility of a paperweight. This suggests Google really has no control over the timer itself once it's been triggered, though we can't be sure. Can I disable this feature (Factory Reset Protection / Device Protection)? Nice try, phone thieves! But really, in the interest of full disclosure, yes - you can disable all Device Protection features (and it is an all-or-nothing switch), including Factory Reset Protection, and doing so is relatively quick and painless on supported devices. Here is the process. Enable developer options on your phone (Google it - it's easy, usually you just go into the settings, "about phone," find the build number (might be under software), and then tap it until it says "You are now a Developer!") Go to developer options and find "Enable OEM unlock." Check the box, and hit "enable." You will get a warning saying this will disable device protection features, and this includes factory reset protection. And I've tested it - factory reset protection no longer works with this checkbox enabled. If your device does not have an "allow OEM unlocking" option, that means one of two things. First, it most likely means it doesn't support factory reset protection to begin with, and that your phone is not protected in the event someone wipes it (or it may have a 3rd party solution!). Second, it could just mean the company that made your phone (or the carrier) decided not to include the OEM unlock toggle and is kind of a dick, and in that case, you only have one option, and it's a bad one (bottom of this section). As to what "allowing OEM unlocking" really does, it basically tells the system that the bootloader is authorized to be unlocked (note: not the same as actually unlocking it) and that Android won't stop you in the event you should attempt to do it. And yes, this makes your phone less secure, because it potentially means a thief could flash custom software to your phone, etc., and Google is politely saying it's not their problem if something bad happens when you do this. If you don't want to use the Enable OEM Unlock method or do not have such a toggle, the only other practical option to disable ADP is to run with an unsecured lock screen. Not very appealing, right? Android Device Protection requires that you have a PIN, pattern, or password for your lockscreen in order to function. Without those things, its features become useless anyway - accounts can be removed from the device without any additional authorization, and thus there's really no protection to begin with. How do I know if my phone has Factory Reset Protection? The easiest way is to just do a factory reset (while logged in to the device with a Google account and a screen PIN/pattern set) and see if you get the following dialog on startup. If you do, you've got factory reset protection. If you don't, you either don't have it or it's disabled. Device Protection should be on almost any Android device that shipped with Android 5.1 or higher out of the box. It will also work on some phones that shipped with some version of 5.0 (5.0, 5.0.1, 5.0.2), such as the Galaxy S6, and were later updated to Android 5.1 or higher. Is there any warning about this when I factory reset my phone? Nope... which seems really bad on Google's part, if I'm honest. Devices should clearly state as part of the factory reset dialogue that they will be completely locked and rendered unusable if you've changed your Google password in the last 72 hours. Does this let phone thieves know how the system works? Certainly, but it still accomplishes the purpose (prevents a wipe), and it would be much better for end users. People have already encountered this feature unwittingly after resetting their Google account passwords, only to be locked out of their only phone for 3 days with absolutely no way to resolve the issue - and these people did nothing wrong. It's totally ridiculous that this is how it works, and Google should most definitely address it. So, the lesson? In the event you change your Google account password, you must wait three days before factory resetting any of your Android 5.1+ devices you use with that account unless you have explicitly disabled Android Device Protection on them. If you factory reset one of your Android devices before those 3 days are up and then attempt to sign into that device with your Google account, you will be met with an error message and not allowed to log into the device with any account until 72 hours after the password reset occurred, which is a major bummer.

IT Admin: "Why are these people still complaining that security settings are too low?" Sorry, power users. In case you've forgotten, Android is still the OS of the masses, and the masses prefer security over absolute account-level autonomy (thank that Wired editor). CoreRooted Honestly, I think Google is right about not lifting the 72 hour period on their end. We would be even more annoyed if all it took was a phone call to Google to unlock the device after it being stolen. If the thief has your device AND changed the password on it, then yes, they have your info. There isn't much that Google can do to say that the caller isn't you. I really can't see any of this as a negative. David Ruddock The lack of being informed that it will happen is the broken part. I agree a hard lockout is fine in theory, but not if you had zero idea it would happen in the first place unless you read an obscure support article. CoreRooted That's a good point (and then one thing in the article that I was shaking my head at). Google has never really been good at announcements, documentation, and marketing. I was trying to think of an instance where Google wouldn't want to let people know about this, but I really can't. It's something we WANT thieves to know about and users also. cpaixao The lock works not because changing password is suspicious, but because you might want to avoid thief from receiving emails at your logged account and browsing your personal data on apps with your account. Despite of that, you'll still able to lock and/or wipe your device with GDM from anywhere. This is the reason for GDP logic. bo ure Thanks for the acronyms, techie Genius. It renders your sentence meaningless unless we know wtf you're talking about or look them up. Bon Hey DAVID! Im not a theft i own a s6 edge plus i forgot my previous passowrd on my google accnt and may back up password in case my fingerprint will fail, now ive got 72hrs locked out. Its really heartbreaking. Is there any other way for me again to use my phone? Is it possible if i changed my password in my google accnt and used it after 72hrs locked out i can use already my s6 edge? Pls do help me. :( victoria atwood Hi can u tell me if I have this 72 hour thing..I turn my phone on it asks me for wiFi then asked me for google email and password .it tellseems me to sign in with owners account but I am the owner..I can't get on home screen or anything..I've only had my smsung edge 6 plus 2 days..Please help before I cracked up ..Thanks x David Navarro i have the same issue right now it tells me to sign in with owners account and Im using the same account can you tell me if your issue was fixed after 72 hours please. It doesn't say anything about 72 hours Shan Yousaf Hey i have the same issue yesterday. i have same error( please sign in with owners account) Kindly telll me is this issue will be resolved after 72 hours? TCH I just run into the issue today and there was no warning from google, what a shame. Oh well nothing to do now but wait those 72 stinking hours but lesson learned. Akshay I have a Moto G3, I first factory reset it in recovery mode, then changed the password from the phone. Now the phone is not allowing me to login, it returns password error with old password, but accepts new password, but after checking the new password it returns the same verification screen. Currently going through 72-hours lockout and tried many times with new password. So, after the 3 days are over, will I be able to login in my moto g3 with new password? Moirrainefortruth Well, there should be a way to go around it if you send a code from your own darn email. Google doesn't get security, they just pretend they do. Shane Johnson Honestly the phone states this when you initially setbup your first gmail with the phone. The people whobare affected by this and “surprised" are peoplr who SKIP through the set up screens. So shame on them bo ure Oh, F.U., it's impossible to read every g.d. little thing this miserable phone throws at you. EowynCarter That. No point in a security measure that can be bypassed. Though a warning would be nice indead. I finally let my bootloader unlocked. Not safe, but I'm afraid that it might prevent me from fixing my own phone in case of bootloop. Don I disagree. I'm in this situation right now. My brother sold me his phone and I asked him for his login to unlock it, but before that I decided to factory reset it to clear it. Unbeknownst to me, he was resetting his password at the same time. Now I'm toast. mfr118 Just so everyone knows I'm the reason for this PSA. Thanks Artem and David for all your help the other day. CoreRooted Ugh... sorry that hit you. 3 days without my DD would drive me insane. mfr118 Insane wouldn't be the word I'd use. I was stuck using my companies iPhone for 3 days.

You guys actually take the time to help unlike those other "Central" Android sites Guest Why would anyone mess with my Google account if they stole my phone? I'm not sure if I understand this feature. David Ruddock You can't wipe the phone to the point of it being resellable without that password - Factory Reset Protection requires it to be verified on boot after a factory reset, and Android won't fully start until the password of the last account on the device is verified. Tl;dr - if you don't have the Google account password (or get locked out after trying to change it), you can't resell the phone. Guest Oh I didn't know that, thanks for explaining. Can't you just log out of the original owner's account and delete the data of Play services, etc. before trying to do a factory reset? David Ruddock That requires the device PIN / pattern / password from the lockscreen, which must be set up for these features to turn on in the first place. GryphKid44 How can a thief change your password without being able to get past the lockscreen? It seems they would have to change your password from a different device which means that they have access to another device as well. David Ruddock It would be unlikely, but entirely possible if they steal your phone while it's not locked (eg BT smart lock, long lock timeout, etc.) nehpets In this instance where somebody has your phone unlocked already, what is preventing them from just enabling the OEM Unlock for their own use? I don't remember the developer options requiring pin/password, etc. EowynCarter Nothing. That's the reason smart lock can be used after I set my work account on my phone.Not safe. All about security vs convenient nehpets So that makes this 72 hour lockout period worthless. It will catch a whole lot of people doing nothing wrong, while anybody who nefariously reset somebody else's password using their stolen cell phone would also take 2 seconds to enable the OEM unlock and not have any issues. Brad You need the pin to turn it off whether or not the phone is "smart" unlocked... so they can't disable it. nehpets That makes a whole lot more sense. Prezes Dyrektor what about flashing a different rom? perhaps even an older version stock? wouldn't that work around this protection? EowynCarter Only if the bootloader in unlocked. And as default, you have to allow the unlock in the developers settings. Or fastboot oem unlock says access denied. Dabu So what am I supposed to do, if I'm selling a phone with this feature? CoreRooted Probably wipe the device first and then change your password afterward would be safer. Walker86 Actually that may not help in all cases. I just got hit with this because of a glitch on my Samsung Galaxy S6 where it suddenly failed to read my fingerprint and asked for my backup password, which it didn't recognize either. T-Mobile suggested a factory wipe to recover the phone, but it wouldn't recognize my google account afterwards. So, they passed me on to Samsung support who suggested I change my google account password to see if that would help - and bang here I am for 72 hours. Whatever the intention, this is a poorly thought out implementation of the concept. There should be a way to validate legitimate owners and bypass this lockout. Tardaboveme Turn off the lockscreen, then remove the google account from the phone. That should let you wipe it without it coming up after the fdr. David Ruddock Correct. ALUOp You don't change your password when you sell your phone, so you don't need to worry about this feature. Just wipe the phone. Despite the length of this article, it doesn't explain things very clearly. Cory S read more. http://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/nexus2cee_Screenshot_2015-03-12-16-48-37_thumb.png ALUOp I don't understand your point. I was telling Dabu that he needs not worry about the 72-hour thing, which this article is trying to explain and apparently got him confused. Cory S When you wipe your phone you need to sign back in with the original account to unlock it.. That part has nothing to do with password changes.. ALUOp Where in my previous comments did I say or imply signing in after wipe has anything to do with password changes? Please read or re-read my previous comments. All I said is Dabu doesn't need to worry about the 72-hour blackout this article is trying to explain. Cory S He asked what he needed to do when he sold a phone with this feature...which disabels a device after a factory reset until the original owner signs back in. He was given the correct answer above, yours would had resulted in a new owner opening up a paper weight. Demetria Streeter thats what mine is saying right now ToniLKerns ====Lates Quality performance androidpolice ...... <**** Find Here Trooper311 Happened to me about a month or so ago. I contacted Google and was told there was no way around it, even though I pressed the issue. Lesson learned the hard way. After 72 hours was up, I was able to log back in. mciuccio Hey, I just did the same thing, I changed my google password, because of a blackshades hack on my work PC. and also in trying to clean up my Note 5 I did a factory reset on it also. I have tried to log back into my Note 5 every day, I also have 2 step verification turned on now with my google account. So currently my sim card is in an iPhone 5 I suppose for three days from now, after reading this article. I am just wondering will I have to try to log in with my new google password or my old one I changes? Does anyone know? Jey New one Bunklung There was another Android Police article on Factory Reset Protection and someone posted a comment indicated that even with an unlocked bootloader and allow OEM unclocking that factory reset protection still worked even when reflashing the device to stock. The account check/FRP happens server side. http://www.androidpolice.com/2015/03/12/guide-what-is-android-5-1s-antitheft-device-protection-feature-and-how-do-i-use-it/#comment-1903978565 I think this complicates resale too. If the seller doesn't remove FRP (pin/password/pattern) and factory resets the phone and throws it in a mail, that's a sad day for the buyer. I wonder if Swappa will disclaim this. There are a few comments about unintended resale consequences: http://www.androidpolice.com/2015/03/12/guide-what-is-android-5-1s-antitheft-device-protection-feature-and-how-do-i-use-it/#comment-1982676882 Normally a seller and a buyer are always aware of the ESM/MEID status, but now the big question will be, "Is FRP disabled and the phone reset to factory???", in each listing right next to ESN status. TylerChappell This article helps make all the theives better theives. ;D Their only requirement now is to pick out a person they think would be too lazy or incompetent to regain control of their account within 3 days. Brad You can't fix stupid. TylerChappell Lol right you are, sir! João Victor Schiavo I liked the article a lot, but I got confused at some parts. I read it again and again, and now the only part I didn't get very well is this: "Two-factor authentication generally relies on SMS, so the thief would get the authenticator on your stolen phone, and you probably would also have your backup email account synced to that smartphone as well" Could anyone explain me this? Thank you. :) lamenting Let's say your backup email account was a Yahoo account. You might have the Yahoo Mail app on that same phone. So if you change your password on your Google account to block the thief, the thief could request Google to send the login reset email to your backup email account - your Yahoo account - and compromise your Google account. So don't put your backup email account on your phone. :) João Victor Schiavo But if my phone has a PIN, he can't see the email received, right? Also, what about the first part, before the last comma? That's what I didn't understand. PS: I don't use a backup email for my main account. :P blindexecutioner Your phone is the authenticator. João Victor Schiavo But how? You mean my phone number? But he wouldn't be able to see the message my phone receives, be it by email or by sms. CoreRooted That isn't necessarily true. Lollipop allows you to have your notifications displayed on your lockscreen... EVEN if you have it locked with a pin, password or pattern. The contents are still there. So, yes, a thief COULD see the SMS code or the code in the email (depending on client and such). It is possible. Internet Guardian Good article!! Now can someone please let me the know the best way to Reset/Format a device Android 5.1 device before selling it? Alexander Sofinskiy Yeah! I am looking for that too, how to reset your phone before selling? and how to not get locked with used devices which I bought from somebody?? yankeesusa There was a cnet article on this. here is a quick way, first things first, don't reset until you activate encryption. Then after you encrypt the phone, factory reset. This should be good for most people. If you want to go even further, then after factory reset, go back in the phone and add a bunch of fake info, then factory reset again. Do this several times if you want. After all this, remember to unencrypt phone. Of course some phones will not let you hard reset unless you decrypt. I think the g3 does this. Ali Mahdavi Thank you Android Police, it was really useful! blindexecutioner Thanks. I very well could have done this around the time a new version of Android drops. CoreRooted Nope. In fact, if you are selling the device, you should just wipe it (I do this about 5 times just to be sure) and then DON'T log back into it. Change your password for the account the device was previously setup with after you wipe it (the changing of it before the wipe is what triggers FRP) and you should be good. sugarwer765 Power Read police article < w­­­w­­­w.­­­­N­e­t­C­a­s­h­­­9­­.­­­C­­­o­­­m Peter Siegmund I don't have the "allow OEM unlocking" on my Nexus 4 (with Android 5.1.1). Where can I find this in the developer options? EowynCarter Not there on my nexus 4 either. Erroneus I believe Nexus 4 doesn't have the necessary hardware to support the needed encryption, which is why this feature is not present. Nexus 4 owner here my self. Arpan Malviya Not on my N5 either Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson You can't. Nexus 4 and 5 don't have that option cabbieBot Did this one get rushed out the door or was it intended to just address stock users? Because that's the only way it makes sense. Those of us who want SU and have our bootloaders unlocked are still out here, ya know. So, some questions. 1) Factory Reset. Let's get that defined. I take it that the article primarily addresses the aftermath of what happens when you choose the option in the "Backup & Reset" submenu in Settings, and selecting the choice for a Factory Data Reset at the bottom, below all the "please generate a hash of my soul's identity and back it up please" options. * But, that's still not clear. There is also this line: "since a wipe can be done directly from the recovery menu on bootup." What recovery? Stock recovery? What if I have CWM or TWRP as a custom recovery, does it trip it? And goodness, how would it if I factory reset using a custom recovery? What If I just dirty flash a ROM update when I've changed a password to an account on the phone? Or do a wipe of any/all partitions from a custom recovery, flash a brand new ROM, and reboot? Or restore a nandroid? What is phoning home? 2) This occurs for any google account the phone is locked into? So, if I have a secondary (or tertiary, even!) google account logged into my phone, this applies there too? 3) I have an LG G3 and the recent firmware update (ZVA) was to backport this feature to the current android version we are on (5.0.1). There is no OEM Unlocking option menu, either, but the article says there are only two cases when that will happen. Can we expect similar behavior? CoreRooted To answer #1 (from what I understand from the support docs: https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/6172890?hl=en), it isn't the action of wiping that is the trigger. It's the setup AFTER the wipe. The recovery type (stock, CWM, TWRP, etc) shouldn't matter. When you go into setup (and enter in the network info), the device contacts Google to determine if it is participating in the Factory Reset Protection (easy enough to do as Google keeps a UUID of every device that has Android installed running 5.x+)). Most likely the trigger is that something has changed on the /data or /system partitions (maybe even lower level than that) and that is what triggers the lock. As for #2, it applies to the device. So, if you signed in with [email protected] , change the password and then factory reset, ANY ACCOUNT will be locked out of that device. You can still use your account on other devices (and with the web), but not on THAT device. The device, at this point, can ONLY be unlocked with your account and new password. For a thief, they essentially have a brick in their possession. So, even if you have [email protected] , you still won't be able to sign into THAT device. #3) Unknown at this point. I also have a G3 and I haven't changed my password in about 40 days. I don't really WANT to test it, but I'm willing to bet that LG made it so that we cannot turn off the FRP at all. yankeesusa This is a great feature to have. But there should be a warning on phones and online letting you know that their is a possibility of a 72hour lockout. Other than that I'm glad they are doing this. CoreRooted There's a support article... Buried deep within Google's docs for the Nexus line. lol... https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/6172890?hl=en yankeesusa I'll take a part time job just to read the docs LOL. They should post a warning on the phone itself though. Maybe with enough complaints they will. Blackangel3942 I can think of one reason why they do not post a clear warning: and that is so that it can catch the potential thief off-guard, and apparently it works as it caught David and many others off-gaurd. DanSan Good information here, thanks guys. I use 2 factor authentication but dont use SMS as a way to get codes. I have a set of printed codes i keep locked at home and use the google authenticator app on my devices. it is also password protected separately inside the phone. dont have my recovery email on that phone either, didnt even think of that before. DanSan If you didn't know about the 3 day lock out prior to doing a wipe I can completely understand that and I feel for people. On the other hand, to complain about Google not being able to reset it is very different. its like yelling at your bank for asking you security questions when you try to call them up and access your account. its protecting you for a reason and if that security is simply compromised with a simple phone call there is no reason for having it in the first place. Maybe they could add something to clear the hold once you're back into your account but im not sure if that would put any holes in this defense or not. either enforce it all the time or never, thats how security works. DanSan im still very curious about the effects of having unlocked bootloader. I originally unlocked the bootloader of my nexus 6 when it was on 5.0 and updated it manually to 5.1.1. its still unlocked but the oem unlocking toggle is not turned on. if i try to turn it on im greeted with the pin screen and a warning telling me it wont work anymore. have we 100% confirmed this? im already bootloader unlocked so i dont really care but curious how it could effect locking/unlocked bootloaders. CoreRooted It shouldn't affect the bootloader at all. With FRP enabled, you can wipe the device 100 times and the result will still be the same. It's the setup (the phone home to Google) after reboot that determines if you are locked out or not. dannyR Google implements tight security (or tight anything) only when it doesn't affect them financially. You're scrued for 3 days? Tough beans. Aris Routis The fact you're not warned,is the right thing to do. It would defeat the purpose of having such a mechanism in place if you were to announce it in the first place. Murilo Antas Pereira Happened to me on a 3rd gen moto g. Even with no security set on lockscreen. Cindy Craig I changed my Google password, did a factory reset on my phone and ended up here. Now, once the 72 hour lockout is over, do I enter my old password or new Google password into my phone to activate it again? I am unclear...and would appreciate any help Mahak Bansal Same Situation....What to do?///// WHAT WAS THE SOLUTION?????? Cindy Craig The only solution is to wait the full 72 hours, then enter your new google password into your phone. Then, it will work normally. In the meantime, I put my SIM card into an old phone that I had while I waited. rayan tahir i have changed my google password after factory reset from recovery mode. I cannot open frp lock what can I do now? pntless I just got nailed by this. Maybe do a reminder post since Marshmallow images just pushed? Jerry What a nightmare..... Google blames Samsung, Samsung blames Google, Sprint throws their hands up in the air and points to both Samsung and Google. Legitimate owners are caught in this finger pointing exercise and quoted company policy and we have to wait 72 hours. Insane. bo ure Quite. Jerry So can anyone tell me about FRP Unlock applications that are being offered in other forums? Pramit Bhattacharyya I changed my gmail account password last night.After that I had a hard reset on my mobile device but I stuck in the sign in loop.It shows ''this device was reset.To continue sign in with th e google account that was previously synced on this device.'' What to do? Should I wait 72 hours.After that can this device will open by putting my new gmail password? Mahak Bansal same dude....STUCKED HELP GUYZZZ DANIEL S wait 72 hrs!!! pcnexus http://www.pcnexus.net/2015/12/what-is-factory-reset-protection-google-72-hour-lockout-android-lollipop.html Eric Paroissien Excellent article and helpful. Mel I just bought my Son a Droid Turbo for his Birthday like 2 weeks ago. He is 14 and forgetful so he has locked himself out of his phone and can't remember his gmail email or password. I understand the wait 72 hour thing but when I called Motorola they said after 72 hours it would give me the option to make a new google email and get in that way. After reading these comments I am thinking the guy at Motorola is wrong. Also if that is the case his phone is unusable so money down the drain. Am I correct? Verizon is our carrier and they suggested I call Motorola. ryan have you heard anythiing back? Jonathan Hawkins I was locked out of my Samsung Galaxy phone but did find a company called RockIT Repairs that can remove the Factory Reset Protection from any Android phone. They charged me $50 to do the FRP removal. This is the link for their removal service http://rockitrepairs.com/frp-factory-reset-protection-removal/ . I hope this help someone like it did me after being locked out of my phone. GabbyGibby This happened to me when I took my new galaxy 5 note to the ATT store because my bluetooth was not working in my car well they had to do a hard reboot I forgot my password for google she said no problem will just change your password Here I am on the third day of my lock out Thank You AT&T. After calling her supervisor because we couldn't get into my phone she apologized and said sorry there is a 72 hour lock I didn't know about this. Well we know now don't we. Thank you for this article I loved it and I'm passing it on for other people so they don't have to go through this. Will This is completely ridiculous and absurd. Ok, i can understand the need fit ask the security, I'm up for all that. What really gets me riled up is that Google does not inform is users of the update and even are you have been locked out, you still don't know why, or for how long and not only that, here i am on the phone with my service provider trying to figure out how to get accesd to my phone and all but still, nothing. I cant even finish setting up my phone, or even skip the google account set up and just be able to at least use my phone period. After getting my replacement phone two days ago, my finger scanner was failing to work, had forgotten my new backup password, it wouldn't log me on with my google account, thought THAT password might be wrong so I changed it. That was not working so i got on the phone with my service provider and street about half an hour end up having to do a hard rest on my phone. So evening stated up just fine, but then i get that screen saying the phone was reset, to use account that was previously synced on device, goes to next scrern, let's me ounch in password, then back to 'VERIFY YOUR ACCOUNT' and stuck in a never ending loop. If you are locked out at least tell me I'm locked out and for how long, instead of making me loop in the hopes i might have puncged in my password wrong or m7spelled my account email, but it just asks yo enter the information. So it took another hour long phonecall with my service provider, which ended up in another factory reset, and after tech support did some digging, found this article informing me about this. Now I'm stuck unable to use phone. There has to be something Google can do about this, I'm sure they wouldnt write a program without being able to bypass it and letting you acces your stuff sgai. What if there was an emergency or something? Im sure that if your phone was stolen, you'd report it, and get on a computer and wiped thee stolen veice remotely or locked it or something. When i lost my phone once, i immediately got online locked it, and not being able to find it, erased it, called my service provider and had service stopped on phone so as to not allow anyone else use or access to my i formation. Obiously Google does have a way to verify that it's you and not someone else trying to get accesd to your device or even your acvount, with so many security measures in place. Has Google received enough complaints about this? Enough to make some kind of change? pcnexus The 72-hour lockout is by default active. So, if you do a factory reset in recovery mode, you still won't be able to login and verify device ownership for the first 72-hours. I didn't change the password after factory reset and the device is now not allowing me to login and verify. Waiting for 3 days to pass, previously unlocked the phone after 3 days. RE Casper Here is another fun point [sarc]... I ran into this problem myself, waited the 72hrs and after I still couldn't get back in, I contacted Google Customer Service. The answer I got... "Call Motorola about getting the phone replaced".... Now, here I sit, $600+ paperweight of a phone in hand. So, moral of the story... it's not just getting locked you should be worried about with this "new security feature". You may just end up with an inaccessible device and far more than 3 days of having no phone, like I have. pcnexus You can unlock the phone. Read this tutorial. I have unlocked the phone 2-3 times after FRP is initiated. http://www.pcnexus.net/2015/12/what-is-factory-reset-protection-google-72-hour-lockout-android-lollipop.html Peter Goodstadt Thanks for that info it worked a treat to reset my one plus for reselling.Peter G Nony I hate this feature more than anything. Im always changing my password to my gmail, and i have a really insecure boyfriend who always tries to put spyware on my phone, so im always resetting it. I dont know how many times I've been locked out of my phone in emergency situations because of this. I NEVER HAVE A WORKING PHONE!!!. It makes me want to switch to Apple. I am so over Android because of this feature!!! Stephen Can I ask someone on this blog to answer a question I have regarding my Moto e. I'm an old guy, 64, not a techie like you folk are. I do not text. Fingers too fat, eyes too bad. I don't want to email anyone or anyone to email me via my phone. I have an email account on Gmail for that. Why does my phone keep noticing me that I need to enter the correct password for ????? It says it 'Couldn't sign in'. I don't know if I want or need it to do so. Any idea as to why I should provide my email password? I understand it was set up by my son an IT guy but I change my password every 6 months or so and after changing it this last time, I started getting this request. Thanks much Sajeev Pattath Thanks for info. I am facing the same problem for my moto g3. it auto updated to android 6 and there is some issues. No incoming calls are getting on phone . Then i changed password and done factory reset. after seeing this at least i am happy that i may able to use my phone after 72hrs Lead Poisoner Didi it work after 72 hours? Chris Lee After the 72 hour wait period, am I going to use the password that I changed it to? or do I need to know the original one which I prob don't know pcnexus Please read this article to completely get out of this lockout. http://www.pcnexus.net/2015/12/what-is-factory-reset-protection-google-72-hour-lockout-android-lollipop.html Jey Use the new password Lead Poisoner Is it stiĺ 72 hours? Just happenned to my phone sony xperia z3 plus Dickie Whiteside BOOM! Fix for Factory Reset Protection https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuPIhiFZoaI DJ Anderson Honestly, no system is full proof. Thieves will be thieves and I do feel this is overkill. If you don't, this obviously hasn't happened to you yet. This just happened to me without any warning from the system whatsoever. I feel a lawsuit brewing if Google doesn't fix this one size fits all approach to phone thievery. Furthermore, I can't for the life of me figure out why it can't just use your thumb print scan to bypass the lock. Obviously if my thumb is there, it's me. Which brings me back to my point - no system is full proof, and this one is flawed big time. ZULUWA GO TO HELL GOOGLE WITH YOUR FREAKIN ARTIFICIEL INTELLEGENT STUPIDITY. I did a factory reset, I erase the all phone data. I was going crazy.. Even I erase media data. F**** Y plug-Ugly arsemongers. And Thank you Folks with you precious clarification, yesterday I was unable to sleep until morning and I was about throwing the phone on the wall, Appreciate you post. Uzer Account Does it matter if my phone is on or off? Should i turn it on/off in 3 days for it to unlock? Frank Markovich I changed my password to ensure there would be zero issues when I reset my phone....fuck me running. Esther McGough I like the protection, but I hate that no one knew this until I researched it, I could have bought a new phone last Thursday, had my phone number put on it and got my account straightened out then had to wait the three days, instead i was frustrated until today when I did just that, so to get into my phone i still have ANOTHER three days , get this information out to people who sell your phones Randy Deaton Just to add to the discussion but I just bought a used phone and the previous owner factory reset it before sending it...now I have a phone that I literally cannot use because of this feature! If I ever try to log in it wants the "previous" account and I do not have the previous owners information! In my scenario this feature is pretty dumb! Denys Kravchenko Nexus 5x, Android 6.0.1 - not 72, 24 hours now :-) Lead Poisoner I hope its true i need it for my job hrzn well I just got f'd by this on my s7, the damn thing randomly stopped recognizing my finger print after months of it working, I had 2 attempts left, I decided to shut the phone off and turn it back on knowing when I do that it instead asks for me to input a password, which I've done a few other times when restarting my phone, but I guess I forgot the exact password, so both attempts struck out, it shut off, reset, apparently stated it would delete everything now it wants my google account, no problem... except I had my google password set to be remembered on everything, so I haven't actually put that in for several months, I forgot that too, it says "forgot password?" I clicked that, reset it, now it just loops back to putting google account info in again. I can't get past it, is this the 72 hour thing you mention, now I have to wait that long? This is ridiculous. Waste of $700, and I'm gonna be f'ing pissed if my baby daughters photos were deleted. Marcus Silva Almost got locked out, luckily I had 2 accounts guest23 You sir saved me! I was sitting up sulking and whining because I was locked out but I have two accounts! I thank you and my daughter thanks you lol tffk I'm locked out of my brand new OnePlus 3 because of this bullshit. It would have been nice to be warned first! Varun Menon Same. Locked out of my oneplus3. Have a couple of questions, after the 72 hour period, should i factory reset the phone again and then log in with my new pass or not factory reset and just log in? Angelo When does the 72 hour timer start??? Jesus. The most basic question and you never answered it! Is it 72 hours after performing the reset OR 72 hours after changing your password! bo ure Apparently, after changing your password. Mostly likely because IT TOLD YOU TO when you tried to sign back in. (I'll bet $100.00 you entered your email and password, both new and old a million times trying to get your legal phone back in use. Man, I hate Google with the heat of a thousand suns.) Kayla P-P I don't know if anyone is still monitoring these comments, but I have a related problem. I have a brand new S6 edge. My son was telling me I needed security on my phone, so we were trying to set up the fingerprint scanner. The scanner would NOT read my fingerprint, so we did NOT set up a backup password, and I NEVER enabled the fingerprint security. I did set up a four digit pin for the swipe screen. A day later I REMOVED the swipe screen pin because I was trying to move stuff to my phone via USB and I had to keep typing in the PIN. When I removed it, the phone did NOT ask me for my fingerprint or pin. The same day, I updated to 6.0.1. Then, I tried to go back and put a PIN on the swipe screen (which, after the update, I did not have anymore! When I wake up the phone it goes directly to the home screen). I cannot even ADD security to my phone because it is asking me for my fingerprint (which the scanner never took) or backup password (which I never set). I am resigned to a factory reset, but am worried about the Google lockout. In anticipation of the reset, I removed 2 factor authentication from my Google account. Will THAT start the 72 hour clock, like resetting the password would? I am not locked out of my phone, so I can use it...just wondering if I need to wait a few more days before attempting the reset. I have read that a lot of people have problems with getting back into their phone after reset with Google...I don't know if that's just because so many people have changed their password, or if there is a glitch with the phone software. That worries me more than the factory reset itself! In my googling about this problem, I found this too: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McQbcCHN3b0 Andreas Hello, very good article. But I want to tell you now, I had reset my mobile phone, I was waiting 3 days, I had put my details, and didn't work, then I had changed my google account password, and I was trying again, it didn't work, I was called Google Support, they had told me to wait 72 hours and to try again. I was waiting 4 days today, I was trying again, and I can't log in. What should I do?! ([email protected] ) Simone Ramella Thanks for the useful information. I only wish I read this post two hours ago, before factory resetting my wife’s Motorola Moto G as suggested by our phone company (she has been unable to receive any call in the last few days and they were unable to give us any help). Of course, she did not remember her Google account password, therefore I had to change it right before factory resetting the phone. Now I found out that for at least 72 hours (why not a couple of months?!) she won’t be able to use her mobile phone at all. Which is not really a joke if you don’t have a spare one to replace it (we don’t) and need it for your work and/or to keep in touch with your children, and not just to play Pokemon Go. It seems Google cares a lot about our security, but doesn’t care at all about warning its users that they may be locked out for at least three days from their own phones if they dare to change their Google account password. They can call it “security”, for me it’s just total nonsense. PANDAMONIUM🚀 God damn it, now if only I had known this 20 minutes ago. Also, I read that the lockout is for 24 hour snow, instead of 72, is this correct? bo ure I HATE this phone more than anything I've ever purchased. Samsung Galaxy S6 through Sprint. It's been hours and hours and hours and hours and untold piled up hours of straight up heartache, grief, and pure aggravation, reading and researching, and so precious little use. WORST purchase of my entire life. And now I'm not even having the service I pay a fortune for each month. And now it will undoubtedly cost more $ to pay somebody to bypass. And this is what happens when three giant corporations are all involved in a matter so simple as a phone. And I thought Apple was obnoxious. The 3-way marriage between Google, Samsung and Sprint beat them by a mile. Never again. When my contract is up, this is the last. Heba Reda Attar I have a question.. when the 72 hours are finished, and i try to log in again with my new password it will log me in? or i have to log in with my old passwords? Alexander Baron Just for the record, I think this article should clarify that the phone is now only locked for a 24-hour period. I recently spoke with a Google Support representative after my phone was locked Nuala Ronan yes, the notification on my oneplus 3 is 24 hours. i wish we could authenticate another way similar to banking recovery. even 24 hours is ridiculous Kyrstol Dinger Do you have a phone number for google support? I have been doing this dance with the 24-hour wait even though my password hasnt been changed for the last 4 days!!! Cara Huggett Seriously, where can I address a complaint letter? I was forced to factory reset my s7 because it kept freezing and shutting off on its own. In the process of setting my phone back up I had to sign into my gmail. Well the the problem is that I have been signed into my gmail account automatically on my phone for over a year and I don't remember my password. I had to reset my gmail password online so I can sign in and set my phone back up. Now I am locked out for trying to set my phone back up? Brilliant really! There must be a better option than this. CT So if my phone keeps saying verify your account I have to wait 72 hours and then what?? Nuala Ronan i have changed my google password 3 times since i got my phone and i cannot remember the original password i registered with. Google does not keep a listing of archived passwords. Does this mean i am permanently locked out out my phone if i cant remember my original password? Laura Covarrubias It is a very helpful and detailed information, thanks. I have a question that I hope you can help me with. I did the reset on my phone without Changing the password; I simply forgot the password and after several attempts I thought the reset was the option to go, however when I tried to set up the phone again. It did not et me to connect to wifi because the phone was unauthorized reset. Does not say anything about waiting 72 hours or gives any other option. Do you know what can I do? Thank you Xchris This should also include updating your version of android. I have to wait 24 bloody hours to use MY phone. Absolute fuckers. Why the hell can't they tell you this before the update begins. I'm furious Thomas Let me get this straight: - I own the phone - I have my new Google account password - I still remember my old Google account password and yet Google arbitrarily decides to ban me from using my phone, without providing any way to prove my identity? That's insane. On top of that, no information is given about this ban, neither on the log screen, nor in my Google dashboard. I am buying a non-Android phone first thing tomorrow morning. TCH Apple? I''m not sure if Apple has something similar? It's going ok, I just feel victim to Google as well and have to wait 72 stinking hours. No warning no nothing, had I known I would've changed my password earlier than do the factory reset. Glenn Beaumont So google tells me a foreign computer has logged into my google account whats the first two things I do??? Change my password (of course) and then reset my phone. I DO THIS FOR SECURITY - and then I get locked out. A warning would have been nice because I would have done it in the other order (reset my phone first and then changed my password) to avoid this. It's very annoying and has convinced not to buy google crap anymore. Dennis Zisman Great time to find this out! At least it is only 24 hours now, GD stupid, not making this a known fact until - Hey I'm locked out! Tren Dix When does the 72 hours lockout start?...is it everytime I Hard reset or factory reset the phone?...so when I do that it also resets the 72 hours?...it is already pass 72 hours since I made the 1st hard reset...but before that...not knowing about this problem...I have multiple hard reset my device...im using a nexus 6...it was my dads...so I dont a problem in google account...please help thanks...

The Information: Google plans to release a Google Home with mesh networking Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/05 10:03am PDTApr 5, 2017 28 Plus 1 on G+ 25 Share on Facebook 50 Share on Twitter Total Shares103 Google Google Home Google Wifi News Ever since the release of the first Chromecast, Google has been working hard to establish a place in your home. Last year's $129 Google Home was a major release, but it seems like Google isn't stopping there. According to a report from The Information, Google is working on an upgraded version of the Home to compete with the Amazon Echo. From "a person with knowledge of the project," the new product will be a Google Home with built-in Wi-Fi capabilities. Much like the Google WiFi, which was launched around the same time as the Home, it can act as a router and as part of a larger mesh network. This can probably be best described as Google WiFi with Assistant built-in. A person with knowledge of the project told The Information, "They want to have complete coverage of Wi-Fi in the house. Alphabet’s goal is to get more devices in the home that do more. Coverage of Wi-Fi is a huge pain point." I'm a bit skeptical. This new upgraded Home would definitely cost more than the existing model, and support for non-Google networks is unknown. I'm sure the Assistant functionality will work on any Wi-Fi network, but how will it work for networks not using a Google WiFi/new Home as the router? Hopefully we'll find out soon.

Instead of having 4 devices in my house, I could have two - and the cost should scale I'd imagine - maybe $200/device means $400 sunk cost vs. $520. Jimmy Roche So I bought the Google home and the Google onhub, so I'll buy the Google wifi home onhub thing so that I get +3 exp on Google play games when I use my Google pixel on my Google Chromecast over Google fiber FRKSUP #Invested Josh Phillips I have 3 Google Wifi pucks... I also have Google Homes in those same rooms. Makes way too much sense to come from Google, but I very much look forward to this. Chris Sanner I would've looked forward to this *before* I bought two google homes and the three-pack of wifis... OligarchyAmbulance Yeah this seems a bit ridiculous to come out with these after we've all already bought their routers and Home's separately. Morten Ulv I guess people won't need those things in the future. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Now you will be able to put one more google device in the same rooms James Briano Add a proprietary messaging app and I'm sold. Serge Cebrian why only one when they can make several! Suicide_Note Price this one at $129, cut the price of the regular Home to $89. JD No thanks Goog I'll guard my own perimeter thanks. Unless this Router has sticker packs! Ryan oh cool so it's what we all thought the OnHub was supposed to be with its built-in microphone. but now we have to buy both a new mesh system and more homes to replace the old ones. pass. MJ This makes a lot of sense and could save some people a little money. Now, how about a Google WiFi base with a four port switch for people that would like that? Not that it matters to me... I was interested in Google WiFi at one point but decided a router that someone else ultimately controls is just plain stupid. OhYeah! Google doesn't control the google wifi, it's the same as any other mesh network. Also you could just turn off wifi on your current router and hook the google wifi to that to have more lan ports and have googles mesh wifi. MJ Maybe using the word "control" was to strong but you did see this right? https://www.extremetech.com/electronics/245009-google-accidentally-resets-onhub-google-wifi-routers-server-error I don't need any hardware devices (beyond my phone) tried to my Google account. Suppose one doesn't have a working router already or prefers less devices laying around... Defenestratus Don't need it. I have a 3200sqft home and my Netgear R8500 reaches all corners of my home with signal strength enough to stream netflix just fine. I do need about 3 more Google homes though. Since they got it working with the Harmony hub its become even invaluable than just controlling my smartThings hub. Alec M router, modem, tv box, google home combo?? Paulo I wish they would focus on an unobtrusive and inexpensive assistant module with a decent speaker like the echo dot. Put one in every room that doesn't need high fidelity and my smart home is fully voice activated on the cheap. Integrate intercom capabilities and my dream is complete. The echo dots serve my home automation purposes for now but the knowledge graph is really lacking. Let's see if the Nvidia spot ever comes to fruition. Corbin Davenport Yeah, an Echo Dot with Google Assistant would be great. Defenestratus Still waiting on my 2017 SHIELD to get assistant. Corbin Davenport Tablets aren't getting Assistant. Brandon David Obert I think he is taking about the Shield TV kerrhome Add in z-wave and zigbee and we're all set. Corbin Davenport That would be great, actually. So now you just have a mega Google Home to replace your router, SmartThings Hub/other smarthome hub, and speaker. Serge Cebrian #ReplaceAllTheSmartThings!!! Gerardo Sarabia I thought that was the point of all this stuff when they started announcing it. To integrate it into one simple product. But then they made separate products and services that didn't really work together and instead competes with each other. I hope they get it right but seems kind of early for a Google Home upgrade. bekifft No this makes perfect sense based on Google's history. Google doesn't do crazy stuff like "one simple product". They make separate products, that compete. Then they drop support for them and do it all over again. Luxferro I'll never go back to consumer wifi/routers. DistortStatic Meaning? supersanborn Can't wait to see that it's priced greater than the sum of Google WiFi and Google Home. James Sarino I was thinking of getting a second OnHub to increase my range, and a second Home for use at another location in the house. If this revised Google Home/mesh comes out soon, that would be killing two birds with one stone for me! Simon Seems like they are stealing others ideas. This one looks much better. https://youtu.be/pufR8uJAAw0 Frawlz Oh great... now my wifi won't even listen to me. SHunter Cant we just build in Wifi Mesh Router, Smoke Alarm, CO2 detector, and google assistant into ONE device? Then mount it where you would put smoke detectors. (This would be a wired version, not battery) Jose Romero Next year they will unmerge it. JG IMHO, Google should have done this from the start. As I was plotting out how I wanted to set up my house, I noted that I was thinking of putting both a Home and WiFi in the same rooms (the living room and bedroom). These are the two rooms I spend the bulk of my time in when I'm at home. They're going to be where I want to be able to just call out queries to have answered and also where I want to have the best WiFi coverage. Sure, they're snazzy enough they can each be set out in the middle of the room (as opposed to standard "scary alien" looking routers with antennas sticking out of everywhere). But it's still, I only have so much shelf space in each room, and an even more limited number of outlets. Combining a Home and a WiFi into a single unit would save space, there would be less wires to get tangled and one less outlet would be consumed. And while it may cost more than the Home itself, it probably would cost less than a Home and WiFi unit bought separately... lgg4 Makes sense...I've wondered that as looking at our G WiFi and home sitting next to each other in our kitchen 4Ui812 After this is released whats next from Google ? Why it's Google home version 3 which will be released 2 years after version 2. And Google wouldn't be Google if they didn't remove something from that was useful in the previous iteration. Version 3 will lack a voice assistant because ..... Hey it's Google. That's reason enough. bekifft I hope along with this they announce a major upgrade of the existing Home's Assistant functionality. Starting to feel like I wasted my money Nicholas Conrad Don't forget, Home has pogo pins under a sticker on the bottom. Portable battery powered Home with charging base also inbound. Maybe the charging base doubles as the wifi puck. #MakesTOOMuchSense Ordeith All your data are belong to us. -Google Mike I Just a note. This home Assistant is supposed to conjure up the image of a cup of latte.

According to a report from The Information, on Wednesday, Google wants to include a Wi-Fi router within the next iteration. This would effectively combine Home and the Google Wi-Fi router into one all-singing-all-dancing device. As an added bonus, it would include mesh networking and enable Google Home 2 to act as a Wi-Fi range extender if positioned in black spots around the house. Related: Google Home review The addition could give Google an advantage over the Amazon Echo device, as it seeks to reel in the retail giant’s head start in the arena. The £129 Google Home is already cheaper than the Echo and has the advantage of the power of Google Search, but is yet to boast the same level of third-party integrations. Google Wi-Fi also goes on sale in the UK tomorrow for the same price, so it seems likely any combination of the two devices would cost a little more. The company is offering a double pack for the reasonable sum of £229. Will you be buying either when they go on sale in Blighty tomorrow? Share your thoughts in the comments section below.

Called YouTube TV, the service as we reported in March, will be available at $35/month to subscribers. First, there is a free 30-day trial, which is not unusual when introducing a service like this to the public. 30 days is long enough to try out the service and probably make up your mind if you want to go ahead and subscribe for a full month of unlimited DVR powers. However, signing up for the trial service requires a credit/debit card, and of course, a temporary authorization is required from your end. YouTube TV is only available in five cities at the moment, and could yet spread to other cities. As a result, location is a vital factor to consider before signing up for the service. That is why it is important to not rush your activation until you have confirmed availability in your location. “You need to physically be in your home area—or wherever you’ll most frequently use YouTube TV—to sign up. This is to make sure you get access to the correct local networks. If you’re away from home, we recommend waiting to sign up until you return home.” A statement on Google Support Page said. The five cities to benefit from this launch include, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, Philadelphia, and the San Francisco Bay Area. Residents of these cities will be able to access YouTube TV during the 30-day trial and subsequently when they decided they want to pay for subscription. Watching outside those big five cities won’t give you access to ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox. You will, however, be able to watch all cable networks that are part of YouTube TV. For sports lover, Google said “sports programming can vary widely based on location and content rights.” You won’t be able to watch YouTube TV outside the US since it’s still not an international service. YouTube TV is available for all types of screens, including smartphone, tablet and computer. Also, you can easily stream to your TV with a Google Chromecast or Chromecast built-in TV; and just to add that the service will be available for both Android and iOS. Video Credit: https://youtube.googleblog.com/2017/04/youtube-tv-is-now-live.html If you decide to become a member you can also watch all of YouTube Red Original series and movies. YouTube made its intention to join the big league of TV service provider in 2016 when Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive officer, wrote in a letter to the company’s shareholders: “We aim to provide more choice to YouTube fans — more ways for them to engage with creators and each other, and more ways for them to get great content.” “We’ve started down this journey with specialized apps like YouTube Kids, as well as through our YouTube Red subscription service.” Got something to add to this story?

Leon Lazaroff Apr 5, 2017 4:54 PM EDT YouTube TV is here, and maybe now television as we've always known it actually will start to change. Starting Wednesday, Alphabet's (GOOGL)  Google will be selling subscriptions to YouTube TV at $35 per month, a similar price to AT&T's (T) DirecTV Now as well as Sling TV from Dish Network (DISH) . Sony (SNE)   also has a rival offering in PlayStation Vue. A fifth service will be added to the mix when Hulu launches its own version of online pay-TV sometime this spring.  There are some differences among the group in price points, total channels offered and, in some cases, which channels are included. CBS (CBS) , for instance, isn't yet available on DirecTV Now or Sling TV though it is part of PlayStation Vue and YouTube TV. At present, YouTube TV isn't carrying networks owned by Time Warner (TWX) and Viacom (VIAB) . To hold down the price of these online pay-TV services, operators are making choices about which networks to include and which to exclude. These services aren't meant to be facsimiles of the traditional pay-TV bundle. Consumers, especially younger folks, say they want more choices. The result is a variety of bundles, some skinnier than others. As for YouTube TV, the Google staff aim to distinguish their platform with technology -- most notably, the largest cloud storage of the bunch. Not only does Google offer no limits on the number of programs you can tape and watch later, it will store that video for a full nine months. Only PlayStation Vue offers a DVR function, but its storage time ends after 28 days.  As the service is used, it will probably become clear which user interface is the most convenient. Unlike its rivals, YouTube TV said it's focused first and foremost on mobile users. It expects most subscribers will access the platform through a standalone app separate from YouTube Red, its ad-free platform that launched last year but hasn't really taken off.  Like its rivals, YouTube TV can be watched through laptops and desktops, as well as through Google Chromecast devices. But bells and whistles aside, the biggest reason that cable TV providers such as Comcast (CMCSA) , AT&T, Charter Communications (CHTR) or any other operator should fear YouTube TV is that it's YouTube.  YouTube has over 1 billion users worldwide, almost one-third of all people who use the internet. As Google is fond of saying, YouTube reaches more people in the key demographics of 18 to 34 years old and 18 to 49 years old than any cable TV network in the U.S. The all-everything video site last year passed the milestone of people around the world watching more than a billion hours of YouTube videos every day. Google said YouTube is on pace to eclipse total U.S. TV viewership in the next few years. At present, U.S. residents watch 1.25 billion hours of live and recorded television daily, a figure that's been steadily dropping in recent years, according to Nielsen. It's also worth noting that Facebook (FB) and Netflix (NFLX) draw about 100 million hours and 116 million hours of viewing each, respectively. These are bad trends for pay-TV operators. Eyeballs are going elsewhere. Overall subscriptions to cable TV services fell the most ever in 2016, according to media research group MoffettNathanson. The subscriber decline was 1.7%, or about 1.7 million subscribers. That's a big uptick from recent years when the decline was 1% or less. Younger people especially aren't signing up for cable TV contracts like they once did. So far, online pay-TV has been steadily growing though its total base of users remains comparatively small. DirecTV Now said it added 200,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter, though its base is said to have grown to twice that amount. Sling TV, which launched almost two years ago, has been mum on subscriber totals, though reports have put its subscriptions at around 1 million. Disney's (DIS) ESPN, the most expensive cable TV channel in any subscription bundle, lost 621,000 subscribers in a single month last fall, further illustrating that as consumers are given more video choices, the traditional bundle is losing subscribers. For network owners, this is the most worrying sign in the business. While the new online pay-TV platforms will offset some of the traditional cable TV subscriber declines, skinny bundles mean that some networks will recover lost revenue better than others. In the coming years, it's conceivable that the decline in cable TV subscribers will accelerate as more people cut the cord or just embrace a life as a cord-never. If so, YouTube TV could be the biggest beneficiary. Alphabet, Comcast and Facebook are holdings in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio.

Google-owned YouTube’s first foray into true cable-like television takes to the internet equivalent of the airwaves in select cities today: 40-plus channels of entertainment, news and sports for $35 per month, the so-called skinny bundle. So far, the service is still a little wonky. But the possibilities are there to inspire a whole new generation of viewers to actually pay for TV, and advertisers seem eager to give it a shot. In particular, YouTube believes it can persuade a whole new audience that otherwise never considered paying for TV at all. “There are a lot of ‘cord-nevers’—millennials who never sign on for cable,” says Kelly Merryman, YouTube’s vice-president of content partnerships. “They love TV programming. They just don’t love the distribution.” That means TV, on any device, on demand. (Cable companies may offer similar-seeming options, but so far cable still remains tied to the cable box.)

Reaching even a fraction of that audience could be a boon to marketers. But YouTube TV still has some kinks it needs to work out before it qualifies as a full-blown TV substitute. The Biggest Name YouTube is hardly alone in trying to win at live internet TV. Dish’s Sling TV, Sony PlayStation Vue, and AT&T’s new DirectTV Now are already vying for viewers, and Hulu is expected to come out with its own version of a service later this year. But none of these have really taken off. Analysts estimate that Sling TV, the most popular of the services, has about a million subscribers, meaning YouTube has plenty of room to win market share. And it enjoys a distinct advantage. “There’s already this install base of users who have YouTube on every device and app, and every TV,” says Paul Verna, a senior analyst for research firm eMarketer. The name YouTube alone carries weight as a signifier of people’s viewing habits migrating online. And for networks taking part in YouTube TV’s launch, that could make coming aboard the service seem like a smarter move than saying no. “YouTube brings the brand in online video (to live internet TV),” says Glenn Hower, a senior digital media analyst with research firm Parks Associates. If any platform is likely to cannibalize (more) viewers, it’s YouTube. To not participate as more and more viewers look to the internet for video could mean dealing yourself into irrelevance. READ MORE: How YouTube Reinvented Itself for the Next Billion Users At least, if and when YouTube TV fulfills its seeming potential. The service so far is fun, because television is fun. When you take a closer look, you see some glaring gaps in content compared to regular TV. The experience is not smooth or intuitive in the vein of Netflix, with its single, comprehensive catalog of shows and movies. I gave the service a spin on a YouTube-supplied Pixel smartphone, and overall I thought it was enjoyable, though mildly frustrating. I added some of my favorite shows to YouTube TV’s (unlimited) cloud DVR, and I noticed that tapping into these individually gave me different results. I could watch every episode to date from the current seasons of Saturday Night Live and Empire, for instance. But I could only watch five not-all-consecutive episodes of Shark Tank, presumably due to licensing issues. Those same issues also plague YouTube TV’s sports offerings. You can’t watch the NFL on your phone, for instance, because Verizon owns those rights exclusively. But you can stream games on the web or via Chromecast on your TV. Depending on how YouTube worked out its individual deals with local affiliates among the initial markets where it’s available, you may or may not be able to watch your home team. Which brings up another issue: fragmentation. You can get YouTube TV today in New York, Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay Area, Chicago, and Philadelphia with other cities “coming soon,” according to YouTube. But for now, it’s impossible to generalize about how many channels you’ll get for your $35 each month, because local availability varies per market. On top of that, YouTube TV has the networks ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC, and ESPN, among others, on board. But some are still missing. For me, personally, no CNN or HGTV are big minuses. In short, watching YouTube TV does not yet work as complete cable substitute. For people who like to dip into TV passively to find something to watch, the service does not disappoint, from movies to recent TV to original YouTube Red content (which is actually really funny!—especially CollegeHumor’s “Bad Internet”). You’ll probably find something to like on YouTube TV. What’s less clear is whether you’ll like it enough to pay $35 per month on top of all your other monthly subscriptions. A New TV Business That said, YouTube TV is way cheaper than your typical $100 cable bill. YouTube has never revealed subscriber numbers for its $10-per-month YouTube Red service, the ad-free version of the platform launched nearly two years ago. That’s likely because it never gained traction. “It’s hard to get people to pay for stuff they’d already been able to get for free,” Verna says. YouTube TV, on the other hand, comes with sports, news, and entertainment they would otherwise have to pay a cable company to access. YouTube has not talked publicly about how it can afford to offer such an attractive price, nor how revenue sharing works between networks and content providers. But it’s easy to imagine how a sprawling, hugely profitable company like Google could afford to subsidize the service to get it off the ground as it hatches a longer-term money-making strategy.© WIRED WIRED RELATED: Comcast Looks All Set to Keep Controlling Your Cable Box. Yay In the beginning, ads on YouTube TV will be the same as the ones shown on regular TV. But over time, the company says it will look towards innovating on the ad model. It’s plausible Google could take all the personal data it has already gathered on its users across search, Gmail, Maps, and Android, and use it to micro-target ads to suit a particular YouTube TV viewer. “The application of data to traditional broadcast would make a much more sophisticated advertising product,” says Tom Denford, chief strategy officer for the marketing consulting firm ID Comms. But perhaps even more intriguing, YouTube is now acting more like a broadcaster, as opposed to a platform where it can target an audience narrowly. “One of the barriers to building brands through precision marketing is you don’t have shared media moments,” says Denford. “You have peer media moments.” YouTube TV, however, has the potential to create those very mass-media moments—think the Super Bowl or the Oscars—that brands and advertisers love. The key is that YouTube TV, unlike regular YouTube or any other video streaming service, offers TV in real time, the way cable does. No big internet company has yet been able to crack this barrier, though not for lack of trying. But compared to all the rest, YouTube has the advantage of being primarily a place people come to watch. In other words, YouTube TV has the potential to do both micro-targeting and macro-targeting. Being able to do both could create the kind of virtuous cycle that feeds back into YouTube’s own success. YouTube TV may be wonky now, but that’s not the point. YouTube is playing a longer game, one that’s only just getting started. Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry! There was a problem.

The Information: Google plans to release a Google Home with mesh networking Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/05 10:03am PDTApr 5, 2017 28 Plus 1 on G+ 25 Share on Facebook 50 Share on Twitter Total Shares103 Google Google Home Google Wifi News Ever since the release of the first Chromecast, Google has been working hard to establish a place in your home. Last year's $129 Google Home was a major release, but it seems like Google isn't stopping there. According to a report from The Information, Google is working on an upgraded version of the Home to compete with the Amazon Echo. From "a person with knowledge of the project," the new product will be a Google Home with built-in Wi-Fi capabilities. Much like the Google WiFi, which was launched around the same time as the Home, it can act as a router and as part of a larger mesh network. This can probably be best described as Google WiFi with Assistant built-in. A person with knowledge of the project told The Information, "They want to have complete coverage of Wi-Fi in the house. Alphabet’s goal is to get more devices in the home that do more. Coverage of Wi-Fi is a huge pain point." I'm a bit skeptical. This new upgraded Home would definitely cost more than the existing model, and support for non-Google networks is unknown. I'm sure the Assistant functionality will work on any Wi-Fi network, but how will it work for networks not using a Google WiFi/new Home as the router? Hopefully we'll find out soon.

Jimmy Roche So I bought the Google home and the Google onhub, so I'll buy the Google wifi home onhub thing so that I get +3 exp on Google play games when I use my Google pixel on my Google Chromecast over Google fiber FRKSUP #Invested Josh Phillips I have 3 Google Wifi pucks... I also have Google Homes in those same rooms. Makes way too much sense to come from Google, but I very much look forward to this. Chris Sanner I would've looked forward to this *before* I bought two google homes and the three-pack of wifis... OligarchyAmbulance Yeah this seems a bit ridiculous to come out with these after we've all already bought their routers and Home's separately. Morten Ulv I guess people won't need those things in the future. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Now you will be able to put one more google device in the same rooms James Briano Add a proprietary messaging app and I'm sold. Serge Cebrian why only one when they can make several! Suicide_Note Price this one at $129, cut the price of the regular Home to $89. JD No thanks Goog I'll guard my own perimeter thanks. Unless this Router has sticker packs! Ryan oh cool so it's what we all thought the OnHub was supposed to be with its built-in microphone. but now we have to buy both a new mesh system and more homes to replace the old ones. pass. MJ This makes a lot of sense and could save some people a little money. Now, how about a Google WiFi base with a four port switch for people that would like that? Not that it matters to me... I was interested in Google WiFi at one point but decided a router that someone else ultimately controls is just plain stupid. OhYeah! Google doesn't control the google wifi, it's the same as any other mesh network. Also you could just turn off wifi on your current router and hook the google wifi to that to have more lan ports and have googles mesh wifi. MJ Maybe using the word "control" was to strong but you did see this right? https://www.extremetech.com/electronics/245009-google-accidentally-resets-onhub-google-wifi-routers-server-error I don't need any hardware devices (beyond my phone) tried to my Google account. Suppose one doesn't have a working router already or prefers less devices laying around... Defenestratus Don't need it. I have a 3200sqft home and my Netgear R8500 reaches all corners of my home with signal strength enough to stream netflix just fine. I do need about 3 more Google homes though. Since they got it working with the Harmony hub its become even invaluable than just controlling my smartThings hub. Alec M router, modem, tv box, google home combo?? Paulo I wish they would focus on an unobtrusive and inexpensive assistant module with a decent speaker like the echo dot. Put one in every room that doesn't need high fidelity and my smart home is fully voice activated on the cheap. Integrate intercom capabilities and my dream is complete. The echo dots serve my home automation purposes for now but the knowledge graph is really lacking. Let's see if the Nvidia spot ever comes to fruition. Corbin Davenport Yeah, an Echo Dot with Google Assistant would be great. Defenestratus Still waiting on my 2017 SHIELD to get assistant. Corbin Davenport Tablets aren't getting Assistant. Brandon David Obert I think he is taking about the Shield TV kerrhome Add in z-wave and zigbee and we're all set. Corbin Davenport That would be great, actually. So now you just have a mega Google Home to replace your router, SmartThings Hub/other smarthome hub, and speaker. Serge Cebrian #ReplaceAllTheSmartThings!!! Gerardo Sarabia I thought that was the point of all this stuff when they started announcing it. To integrate it into one simple product. But then they made separate products and services that didn't really work together and instead competes with each other. I hope they get it right but seems kind of early for a Google Home upgrade. bekifft No this makes perfect sense based on Google's history. Google doesn't do crazy stuff like "one simple product". They make separate products, that compete. Then they drop support for them and do it all over again. Luxferro I'll never go back to consumer wifi/routers. DistortStatic Meaning? supersanborn Can't wait to see that it's priced greater than the sum of Google WiFi and Google Home. James Sarino I was thinking of getting a second OnHub to increase my range, and a second Home for use at another location in the house. If this revised Google Home/mesh comes out soon, that would be killing two birds with one stone for me! Simon Seems like they are stealing others ideas. This one looks much better. https://youtu.be/pufR8uJAAw0 Frawlz Oh great... now my wifi won't even listen to me. SHunter Cant we just build in Wifi Mesh Router, Smoke Alarm, CO2 detector, and google assistant into ONE device? Then mount it where you would put smoke detectors. (This would be a wired version, not battery) Jose Romero Next year they will unmerge it. JG IMHO, Google should have done this from the start. As I was plotting out how I wanted to set up my house, I noted that I was thinking of putting both a Home and WiFi in the same rooms (the living room and bedroom). These are the two rooms I spend the bulk of my time in when I'm at home. They're going to be where I want to be able to just call out queries to have answered and also where I want to have the best WiFi coverage. Sure, they're snazzy enough they can each be set out in the middle of the room (as opposed to standard "scary alien" looking routers with antennas sticking out of everywhere). But it's still, I only have so much shelf space in each room, and an even more limited number of outlets. Combining a Home and a WiFi into a single unit would save space, there would be less wires to get tangled and one less outlet would be consumed. And while it may cost more than the Home itself, it probably would cost less than a Home and WiFi unit bought separately... lgg4 Makes sense...I've wondered that as looking at our G WiFi and home sitting next to each other in our kitchen 4Ui812 After this is released whats next from Google ? Why it's Google home version 3 which will be released 2 years after version 2. And Google wouldn't be Google if they didn't remove something from that was useful in the previous iteration. Version 3 will lack a voice assistant because ..... Hey it's Google. That's reason enough. bekifft I hope along with this they announce a major upgrade of the existing Home's Assistant functionality. Starting to feel like I wasted my money Nicholas Conrad Don't forget, Home has pogo pins under a sticker on the bottom. Portable battery powered Home with charging base also inbound.

An Israeli security researcher takes a good look at Samsung's Tizen, labels it the worst code he has ever seen Jordan Palmer Follow View All Posts 2017/04/04 11:26am PDTApr 4, 2017 64 Plus 1 on G+ 276 Share on Facebook 74 Share on Twitter Total Shares414 News Samsung Android is a hulking beast as far as global user share is concerned — hell, it's the most-used operating system in the world, surpassing even Windows (in terms of internet usage). When Samsung announced that it was creating its own open-source alternative to Google's mobile OS, it was not really a surprise. We've had several upstarts over the years, like Sailfish, Firefox OS, Ubuntu Touch, and so on, but all of them have failed in some form or another. There were a few people, however, who thought Sammy could be the one to unseat Google and Android with a mobile operating system that it called Tizen. Whether it's pronounced TEE-zen or TIE-zen is still a mystery (Wikipedia and I say it's the latter), but up until now, word on the integrity and security of the code has been relatively scant. Israeli researcher Amihai Neiderman finally dove into Tizen's guts to see what he could find. According to his report to Motherboard, what he found wasn't good. Niederman claims that the operating system contains what "may be the worst code [he's] ever seen" with signs of amateur mistakes/practices and no less than 40 zero-day vulnerabilities. All of those 40 allow for remote-code execution, which permits nefarious parties to access and assume varying levels of control of a Tizen device. Remember, there are quite a few devices running Samsung's OS, including the Gear smartwatches and some phones. One of the most critical vulnerabilities was in the Tizen Store (the equivalent of the Play Store or App Store), which allowed Niederman to inject malicious code into his Samsung TV (also running Tizen). His conclusion from this was that you as a hypothetical third-party could "update a Tizen system with any malicious code you want." Even the store's authentication measures weren't enough — he just used a heap-overflow vulnerability (which he also discovered) to hijack the software before the security protocols activated. Moving on, Niederman says that Tizen's code base is quite outdated and even borrows some elements from Bada, its predecessor. However, he claims that most of the issues he found were in the new code, which was written in the last two years or so. Some of the mistakes are those one might find programmers making twenty years ago. As Motherboard puts it, this shows that Sammy lacks any basic code development or review practices. To prove his point, Niederman points to one example that he claims was everywhere in Tizen, strcpy(). Basically, strcpy() is a flawed function that is easily exploitable and is not used anymore because of that, yet it is supposedly prevalent in Tizen. To top everything off, Niederman says that the programmers failed to use SSL encryption in certain areas during specific data transmissions. This led him to conclude that they made the wrong assumptions on what needed to be encrypted and purposefully left out SSL in those places. When he initially reached out to Samsung to declare his findings, he was greeted with an automated response. Motherboard's attempts to contact the Korean conglomerate resulted only in the basic PR drivel about the company's focus on security and whatnot. However, after the original article got published, Sammy reached out again to Motherboard to claim that it was working with Niederman to resolve the issues, who corroborated this by saying he was in talks with the corporation. You can read more at the source link below if you're interested. Honestly, I can't say that I'm too surprised. As Mr. Niederman puts it, Samsung should reconsider deploying Tizen to its appliances and future phones before doing a serious overhaul on the code. I find that I agree with him.

(Sarcasm) JohnyNoLegs Lazy coding by coders....SHOCKER!!!! (Sarcasm because even google/apple has shitty code haha) F4LL0U7 But by all means, let's spend $900 on the new Galaxy phone, because I'm sure it's both immune to their terrible code, and totally worth the price tag. Ome Dries The S8 doesn't use Tizen though, so your phone should be safe... your Samsung powered fridge is a different story Leonardo Baez Or their line of smartwatch John Doe Yeah but they probably use the same programmers for Tizen and Android. kalehv I wouldn't think so. Tizen and Android are very very different inside out. demarcmj Probably not the same programmers, but the culture, processes, etc. are probably the same. Just this. the general attitude can't (and won't) be different MJ No... The Android and Tizen programmers are most certainly on different teams and only deal with their platform. This does not mean Samsung as a whole is good at software. John Doe We don't know if they really are on different teams unless Samsung told you. MJ I wouldn't know if Samsung employs cows for programmers unless they told me but I can almost guarantee the teams are separate. Programming teams at any company tend to specialize on ONE project at a time. It's not the same guys... There will be a small number of top programmers who will move from team to to team to fix problems or help with deadlines. John Doe "I can almost guarantee the teams are separate" No you can't unless you are an employee there and know what Samsung is doing. Samsung is not your typical silicon valley tech company so I have no idea how they work. MJ It's funny your whole argument is there is no way we can know how they do it at Samsung yet you had no problem making the statement the Android and Tizen programmers are probably the same which would be a totally unusual setup for any company with large programmer teams. Why not just go with they are probably cows which is why their software is so bad. LOL John Doe They probably are cows :) F4LL0U7 Right, but my point is that their code is crap, and they're making tons of "enhancements" to the Android OS, plus the dozens of Google apps they unnecessarily duplicate. Their terrible code makes a huge impact on the Android ecosystem. tim242 They don't unnecessarily duplicate anything. Samsung has many apps that are far superior to Google's bloatware. John Doe https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e46717cc007988df31954f458f30b8b237b2c4e803101752d08debfaa155bcf3.gif tim242 Samsung Pay>Android Pay Samsung Browser>Chrome John Doe Samsung pay is greater how exactly? And no on the browser I used Samsung's browser it is not as good as chrome. tim242 Ummm I can use Samsung Pay everywhere. As for the browser, you are full of shit. John Doe Umm that is hardware not software, Samsung bought looppay to do that and it has nothing to do with Samsung's software. Chrome is the most used browser in the world...facts. tim242 It is hardware and software, you know like Android Pay uses NFC. You aren't very smart. As for the browser, since when does most used equal best? McDonald's burgers are the most popular burgers, but nobody will claim them to be the best. Do better. John Doe Wow lmao. Looppay uses MST like your credit card so very little software is needed for it to work. You just need to store credit card information. with NFC there is more communications on both ends and more authentication is required. It is more secure than Magnetic strips. But at the end of the day when it comes to software Apple pay and Android Pay are much better (Design, speed, ease of use, etc) I have used Samsung's browser it is featureless. Chrome has a lot of features that I use and it is fast. I save my passwords in chrome, I have data saver, Read later, cached pages for quick reload, Google AMP, autofill is synced, better privacy controls and Do Not Track, Google translate embedded, and fine grain controls for sites accessing camera, microphone, notifications, etc. Samsung's browser is small potatoes compared to Chrome. AbbyZFresh If you've used Samsung's browser, then you would know it's speed >>>>> Chrome is well worth less features in the way John Doe Bitch please you are a bigger troll than Tim and you are a Google hater. Why are you even here? tim242 Your ignorance/stupidity is really showing. MST uses tokenization just the same as NFC. You should educate yourself before commenting about something you know nothing about. Samsung Pay is superior, deal with it. Samsung's browser is lighter, and has more features. You can log into sites with your fingerprint. Try that in Chrome. You can also use an ad blocker plugin. Try that in Chrome. Oh, and it is Chromium based. That means it has a lot of Chrome features as well. Do better John Doe What does tokenization have to do with using the app? We are comparing Samsung Pay with Android pay here and you said samsung pay is better because you can use it anywhere that has nothing to do with samsung pay dumbass that is looppay which samsung bought. It has nothing to do with the actual software. When it comes to the actual app the design, speed and ease of use of Android and Apple pay is better than samsung pay. Chrome still has a lot more features that the two you mentioned. But I can't change the mind of an ignorant troll. A troll is a troll is a troll. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/70cffa9c6cf517883f23a7ea527e30ffa7ecb7b3f6c82e8599d47b0b1cca584e.gif tim242 LoopPay does not exist. Samsung bought it and incorporated it into Samsung Pay, which makes it better than Android Pay. Tokenization means it is not insecure, as you claimed. You are the obvious troll. You make no sense at all. John Doe Looppay is a hardware feature it has very little to do with the app that is like saying I can use 3.5mm headphones with my music app compared to the iPhone. It is a hardware feature but the app at the end of the day is judged separate from that. You are truly fucken moron and deserve a note 7. tim242 LoopPay was the name of a company that no longer exists. MST was bought by Samsung and is part of Samsung Pay. Hardware can't work without software. Why you are trying to separate the two, is beyond me. Take the tech that Google bought from SoftCard/ISIS out of Android Pay, and see how far that NFC chip gets you. You are now on block, as your stupidity is too much for me. John Doe Samsung bought looppay and its patents so you can't have MST on other devices. We are comparing Samsung with Google here so you have to compare only the software not the harware (This whole fucken article is about software and samsung's incompetence). You are fucken retarted Softcard/ISIS was bought for Google wallet not Android pay and it was because carriers blocked Google wallet so Google bought softcard which was made by the carriers. Samsung pay sucks, period. "Samsung Pay's security measures are based on Samsung Knox and ARM TrustZone technologies; credit card information is stored in a secure token.[3] Payments must be authenticated using a fingerprint scan.[6][7] In August 2016, security researcher Salvador Mendoza disclosed a potential flaw with Samsung Pay, arguing that its security tokens were not sufficiently randomized and could become predictable. He also designed a handheld device that could be used to skim magnetic secure transmission tokens, and another which could spoof magnetic stripes on actual card readers using the token. Samsung responded to the report, stating that "If at any time there is a potential vulnerability, we will act promptly to investigate and resolve the issue".[8]" http://www.zdnet.com/article/flaw-in-samsung-pay-lets-hackers-wirelessly-skim-credit-cards/ Middlefinger Just because people are forced to use chrome on Android it doesnt mean its the best. Its the new IE, its terrible on mobile and hardly better on desktop. MJ Who are these people who are forced to use Chrome on Android? John Doe They are not forced to use it. Chrome doesn't come preloaded on desktop but it is still the number one because people go and download it. And it doesn't come preloaded on all Android phones. Middlefinger Yes, it is on every Android phone. If people chose Chrome over Firefox then thats their own problem and its not like FF is perfect either. John Doe It is not on every Android phone. And they choose it because they like it and want to use it. Middlefinger Its compulsory according to the Android licensing agreement, if you want Google play access. John Doe The play store is not on every Android phone...its not on any phone in china for example and the Mobile Application Distribution Agreement is optional and Google chrome is not even set to default and is hidden in a folder on Samsung devices so no one is forcing anyone to do anything here. Middlefinger Its on every phone that has access to the play store. What china does is not relevant to this so dont deflect. You know full well what i was referring to, not that it will stop you claiming victory as is usual on here. Its not hidden, its right on the damn home screen on international unlocked OEM devices. John Doe You said "*EVERY* android phone has Google Chrome". There are plenty of Android phones that do not sign that agreement and do not have the play store on them also the agreement is negotiated with Google including what apps to include. This agreement is also signed with carriers so Google, OEMs and the carriers negotiate it. And yes it is hidden in the US carrier version because I had to go through the app list, open the folder, click on it to use it and also have to make it default...it is not set to default. This was on an S7 edge. https://landing.google.com/intl/en/androidisforusers/faq.html https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-4a46Ko8RE Middlefinger Newsflash, the world doesnt revolve around US carriers.. On the first point.. well done, you won on a technicality that neither of us were even talking about anyway. John Doe That is where OEMs sell the majority of their phones through carriers and specifically US carriers not international unlocked phones which samsung doesn't even update on time (But that is another issue). But even in the international unlocked phone I am sure the S7 also does not have chrome as the default browser. Middlefinger My Samsung devices do, as did my LGs, HTCs and so on (including network branded ones). Some US carriers may have other things installed and set to default, but its the exception in the world. Either way Google requires its bloat be installed, and i dont see that as any better than Samsungs. John Doe You may think is bloat but the billions of Google users out there do not think so go download what you like. Shame-sung C.E.O Swinesung Pay is Garbage. Don't fall for this guys Sheep Mentallity. This is the same person who said CURRENT-C was going to be the winner out of Payment wars LOL!! No joke he was the biggest shill for Months. Shame-sung C.E.O https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d20aef0fbc504aadabb8bd8fde48166d56c8b76806fd4b9f3e699fb0f3c88c9a.jpg https://media.giphy.com/media/l3E6uhDAN3W7vylji/giphy.gif LMFAO!!! LineOS for exynos! I know Samsung browser is based on chromium... But he say 'better' becouse ad blocker... If chrome have ad blocker is will be faster.. that for sure Suicide_Note Two hardly qualifies as 'many apps'. tim242 That was just two examples. Another example is Messages. I have to use Samsung Messages, because Google forces pop up messages, unless you silence them altogether. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages all the time, but I'm not aware of any pop-up messages. Or are you referring to the way the message notification pops up? tim242 Yes, the notifications. Google took the option out of the settings to disable that nonsense. Samsung put the option into their app. Why is Google forcing that on us? It is annoying to have them interrupt what I am doing, and disregards privacy Suicide_Note I like it since i can see if i need to reply immediately or not, or just dismiss it to the notification tray, but to each their own. Good thing we have so many options to choose from. 😊 tim242 Yeah, I would use Google Messenger, if only I could disable that. Knowing Google, they may add that back later. JohnyNoLegs Google doesn't even have an audio recording app LOL. Google has barely anything. Literally BARE Middlefinger amung browser is superior to chrome. A carrier Pigeon is better than chrome, at least Samsung internet actually exits properly when you press the back button. John Doe So go use a carrier pigeon...troll LoL If you like Samsung and their programming skills go buy a Tizen phone Middlefinger I prefer Samsung to Google anyway. Android is a damn mess and getting worse again. Sure 7 is better than the total disaster that was kitkat, but its worse than anything since KK. John Doe Ok so go get a Tizen phone http://www.samsung.com/in/smartphones/samsung-z3/ Middlefinger I prefer Samsungs mods to Android to Googles 'stock', Samsung actually seem to test it before breaking everyone devices. John Doe That is because everyone's device is already broken (Laggy, buggy, slow, and filled with unnecessary apps). Middlefinger Like most of the Google apps, yeah you're right. John Doe Google's apps are updated continually and are stable than the majority of OEM apps since they are mostly updated by OTA instead of through the play store like all of Google's apps. Anyways, that doesn't change the fact that Samsung's software is laggy and terrible...it also gets worse over time which is just sad. And the fact that they take forever to update their phones does not help your argument. Middlefinger Firstly thats horseshit, Google apps are just as unstable as any. Secondly Samsungs launcher can be laggy, jsut like Googles can be painfully limited, so dont use either. The rest of the Samsung mods are better than Googles, especially the notification pulldown. Ive already addressed the update thing. If Google was pushing 7.1.1 to every device in the world there would be hundreds of millions that randomly rebooted. The OEMs test better and it takes time. Older thats stable and fixed is better than newer and broken. John Doe Firstly thats horseshit, Google apps are just as unstable as any. I use Google's apps daily and they are not unstable actually they are highly rated in the play store compared to samsung's apps and are used by way more people that just shows how stable they are. Unless you are using beta version, heck even the beta version is stable so I have no idea what you are talking about. There are always problems with updates even Apple has them with iOS but the difference is Google can push out a fix quickly like Apple. Also with new updates you get security patches and fixes for older bugs that take months to fix when going through OEMs and carriers. If you think Samsung's programming is good go check the article you are commenting on LoL. Middlefinger So what if google can and does patch things quickly, it shouldn't get broken in the first place. This just doesn't happen with most OEM devices, and hasnt to a single one ive ever had. My Nexus devices have been a string of bad hardware, poor software, show stopping faults and RMAs. John Doe I have had several nexus devices and pixel and I have never had severe problems to a point where I had to send it in. There are bugs like any other OEM especially samsung but Google has the ability to fix them quickly. Newflash, it does happen with a lot of OEMs including Apple. This isn't new anyways Google's software is highly praised on the pixel compared to Samsung's "horseshit". Go check the reviews. Middlefinger Im sure the 9 people that have a Pixel just loved the reboots. Nice its fixed, shame it ever happened. Never had severe problem eh? Ive never had ANY with anything except the Nexus'. Highly praised is it? By who exactly? If its the same people that bought the Nexus then they are easily pleased and highly biased. You cant deny there is an entire body of fanboys out there that love AOSP, regardless of how bad it is. If google just secretly used all Samsungs code for 8 it would be the best thing ever, because bias blinds. John Doe 9 people? classy. Nice joke. Never had severe problem eh? Ive never had ANY with anything except the Nexus'. You just lost all credibility just stop. All the tech blogs gave it excellent reviews and said it was the best Android phone available even tech blogs that favor Apple said so and that says a lot. Middlefinger Yeah, OK. Zero Mizukami What didnt you like about kitkat? I was always under the impression kitkat was more or less the pinnacle of Android Audio Totally disagree. There are no Samsung apps on my S7 that I actually use. tim242 That's you. I use Samsung Pay every day, to pay for everything. Samsung's browser is far superior to Chrome. I use Samsung's SMS app, because Google forces pop up messages on theirs. F4LL0U7 That's your opinion, and of course I have my own. It was just a little frustrating when I started my work GS7 for the first time and saw two of nearly every app. As a Nexus/Pixel guy, I'm horrified at Samsung's terrible (in my opinion) design and functionality standards. Not to mention the 3rd party garbage they toss in there too. I had to purchase an app that allows me to disable their default apps. When your first task in the process of setting up a new phone is to wade through and remove the bloat, there's something wrong there. tim242 I purchased a package disabler as well. But I also had to disable a lot of Google bloatware as well. John Doe You need to look up the term bloatware. Lookup, Microsoft office, facebook, and all the other unnecessary apps that don't need to be preinstalled are bloatware. Anyways I don't know what I am arguing with you samsung phones are burning up...literally so unless samsung sells 100+ million s8 they will always be behind apple. tim242 Behind apple haha you are silly. John Doe Why is that silly? They are behind Apple in the smartphone business. tim242 That is not true. Get educated, then comment. John Doe Lmao http://www.techtimes.com/articles/188124/20161208/apple-iphone-7-is-the-best-selling-smartphone-in-us-trumping-the-samsung-galaxy-s7-kantar.htm https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/56f89a4335e2c7fe807cdebf208e142c62b61a5cec127b30c1f4b3c96aee3961.gif tim242 Lmao that is just the S7. Samsung has many other smartphones. You are trying to move the goalposts. Try harder John Doe http://bgr.com/2017/02/03/apple-vs-samsung-sales-2016/ http://www.businessinsider.com/samsung-galaxy-apple-iphone-premium-market-share-chart-2016-12 https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/10/16/samsung-galaxy-vs-iphone-which-product-line-has-so.aspx Apple beat Samsung with 3 Phones....Samsung had 31. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/13806899d2dd953b00745e25586ce63bc99bfb72ae0d42ccd3bbb42fa9c618b5.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78dd8b407e1ea19bc331dea202aae34c0cb0772bea409ff56a11d2efb86e7f9d.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/91444a76a0ec89e25770a31b864244d9c04aad4f64e7c6152e993058b5c82bb9.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/688053d5bd7c128160ba9a9dfe79639b542955188e91c63913e08ee14faa1f85.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e9eb24fa3eae7253df33b2eb97d2250c7c498213eec6de868a759657891aad6b.png JohnyNoLegs Yea like Pixel Launcher, Hangouts, Daydream haha byteseyes Google apps are definitely bloatware. There's tons of Google bloatware I delete every time I get a new device with Android on it. Granted, I think Samsung and Google should get a pass for including their software because it's Samsung's hardware and part Samsung and part Google's software. Completely 3rd party companies like carriers or Microsoft stuffing their software is the worst kind of bloatware. John Doe Google apps are not bloatware because people do use them and they are useful. Bloatware means apps that people don't use and waste space on your device. Google's apps definitly do not waste space and the majority of them are used so no they are not bloatware. These are the apps Google requires most are Google play apps: Google Chrome Google Maps Google Drive YouTube Gmail Google+ (The only one I think is unnecessary) Google Play Music Google Play Movies Google Play Books Google Play Newsstand Google Play Games Google Photos Hangouts (Probably stopped requiring it already) byteseyes Your conclusion that Google apps are not bloatware rests on the premise that people use them. By the same token, Samsung apps are not bloatware because people do use them and they are useful. Realistically, I can count on 2 hands the number of people I've come across who use Google Play Music, Movies, Books, Newsstand, Games, Photos, Hangouts, and Google+. Most people I know do use YouTube and Maps the most, while Chrome is forced onto people often. Drive is a wash. That means almost all of Google's apps are not commonly used, hence waste space. So don't you think it's unfair and untrue to make the assumption that people use Google apps, while simultaneously making the unfair and untrue assumption that people don't use Samsung apps? I personally love Samsung apps and I find most of Google's apps redundant. I can understand if people are vice versa. Haha, sorry, I didn't mean this response to be too long, so all boiled down, Samsung and Google apps are either both bloatware or both not. Hope you can understand that they can not be different. John Doe Fact is that far more people use Google's apps than Samsung's you can check the play store reviews and how many people use them. Google's services are used way more often than Samsung's that is a known fact. Google and Samsung do not release numbers of every single app but Google has a billion+ monthly active users on some of their services. When it comes to the Google play apps, they come in a package with the play store. It makes no fucken sense to have a music section in the play store and no app to play it with. They are a package. Chrome is not "forced" on people. You need to lookup what that word means and Chrome is not even set as default on samsung devices so how the hell is it "forced"? That means almost all of Google's apps are not commonly used, hence waste space. It is silly to make a statement like that So don't you think it's unfair and untrue to make the assumption that people use Google apps, while simultaneously making the unfair and untrue assumption that people don't use Samsung apps? No because like stated above Google has more than billion+ active users on their services and highly rated apps in the play store and they a regularly updated. Samsung on the other hand has even discontinued multiple apps and services because no one is using them like Samsung milk music. https://play.google.com/store/apps/collection/search_results_cluster_apps?clp=ggEJCgdzYW1zdW5n:S:ANO1ljLMiXA https://play.google.com/store/apps/collection/search_results_cluster_apps?clp=ggEICgZnb29nbGU%3D:S:ANO1ljIY5oM Bloatware apps are determined by the user and I am positive that more users find Google's apps in a favorable light than Samsung's. You are in the minority. byteseyes "Fact is that far more people use Google's apps than Samsung's you can check the play store reviews and how many people use them. Google's services are used way more often than Samsung's that is a known fact. Google and Samsung do not release numbers of every single app but Google has a billion+ monthly active users on some of their services." YouTube and Maps are the most popular. The majority of Google apps are not used at all by most people. But that doesn't matter. The point is lots of people use Google apps, and lots of people use Samsung apps too. You can't ignore one group of people even if it's one order of magnitude smaller. It's still a significant number. "When it comes to the Google play apps, they come in a package with the play store. It makes no fucken sense to have a music section in the play store and no app to play it with. They are a package." Many people don't use them. I'm just using your own assumption and logic. I personally deleted them. Whether it makes sense or not to include them is irrelevant. Of course from a company's perspective it almost always makes sense to include their own service. That's business. You're inclined to make justifications for Google but not for others. "Chrome is not "forced" on people. You need to lookup what that word means and Chrome is not even set as default on samsung devices so how the hell is it "forced"?" It's not forced on Samsung devices thank god. But anyway, instead of on smartphones, I was just remembering off the top of my head about the Chrome browser slipping its way into many people's computers, so I was going off a tangent there. "It is silly to make a statement like that" It's pure logic. "No because like stated above Google has more than billion+ active users on their services and highly rated apps in the play store and they a regularly updated. Samsung on the other hand has even discontinued multiple apps and services because no one is using them like Samsung milk music." Again, that's not the case for almost all of Google's apps. Most of Google's apps are not commonly used. Google also discontinues or leaves as zombies apps that no one uses. "Bloatware apps are determined by the user" That's what I've been saying all along. "and I am positive that more users find Google's apps in a favorable light than Samsung's. You are in the minority." Of course a software-centric company is going to have a larger user base. I may be in the minority, but it's still a large number of people. We're not talking about 1 user vs 1 million. If there's 1 user, and an app is installed to cater to that one 1 user, then it would be bad to include the app. But many, many, many people use Samsung apps too. You can't cherry pick what you like and ignore everything that others like. John Doe Exactly so going back to my original comment that Google's apps are not bloatware and that apps from Facebook, Microsoft, and Lookout are bloatware. Also when Samsung has two music apps like Google play music and Milk on their devices and they end up discontinuing Milk because no one uses it that is also bloatware. So I am glad we cleared up your confusion on whether Google's apps are "definitly bloatware" https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/04d006e4bd2b9525b0b0e9550444617ee69614c33bf605ad372243dc9af02410.png byteseyes Logic must not be your strong suit. John Doe Good Job nice comeback byteseyes Thanks. byteseyes I can understand your viewpoint. Me personally, I find most of Google's apps redundant because I really love Samsung's apps. I actually did the same as you haha! I purchased an app to delete all of Google's apps except Youtube and Maps and a few of Samsung's too. I think there are people who use Samsung apps and people who use Google apps. Not referring to you, but some people like to think Google apps are not bloatware because they themselves use them. But many people also love and use Samsung apps, myself included. Even though I love Samsung apps, I can totally understand if people are vice versa. Logically speaking, either both Samsung and Google apps are both bloatware or both not. dabug91 Lol, umm Samsung has it's own calendar app, calculator app, memo app, messaging app, etc and they're all shit. No phone has more bloatware than a Samsung phone. They win hands-down in that category. tim242 I prefer all of those to Google's offerings. I'm glad to have a choice. OligarchyAmbulance You honestly think they have higher standards for their lagfest Android skin? tim242 They have higher standards than Google/HTC with the dumpster fire that is Pixel. John Doe https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a1405ef722a16da1e676294296d43a0d524eaaf5c53be0f4ec6d89b9ab035eb1.gif M. Luciano What? Where are you getting all this? tim242 There have been numerous hardware issues reported since release. Some of which being the microphone, speakers, camera, and the display. tekfr33kn I've had my Pixel for a few months now and haven't had a single one of those problems. I know that a few people have had them but it's more rare than you you are making it out to be. Audio Or for Knox for that matter! Bob http://imgur.com/gallery/UrhOtai Middlefinger No it uses Android, which we all know is perfect/ s ... At least Samsung fixes the mess Google creates most of time though. Jumanji! Are you perhaps conflating user experience with quality/security of code? A company can make something look pretty or function, but that doesn't mean there aren't any issues with the security of their code. Computer science isn't an exact science and creating software is always a series of trade offs. Middlefinger No im basing it on all the problem Google has with its own devices and how much time OEMs have to spend fixing Google code before they release it on their own devices. Jumanji! What do you expect? Android is a big, complex platform and there are a number of OEMs who blend it with their own, unique hardware variations and services. It's absolutely normal for customers to find defects in shipping products. It's ultimately how the company reacts to customer facing defects and issues that really matters. I'd love to see a list of the volume of defects that OEMs have fixed in the Android platform. I think data has the potential of strengthening your arguments rather than having them appear to be nothing but hyperbole. Middlefinger Not all fixes they make is committed back to stock. Much of what the OEMs do is proprietary, but given that OEM devices dont have the problems AOSP based devices do its reasonable to say they fixed something. If all the Google devices had identical hardware you could argue the problem is which specific hardware, but thats not the case. Regardless of the hardware the problem persists because the problems are in Googles code. Zsolt V You are right in everything you wrote. Congrats, finally a sane voice. F4LL0U7 If that was sincere and not sarcastic, thanks! JohnyNoLegs Haha doesn't run Tizen. Fail. Google code their own bugs anyway. F4LL0U7 No shit, try reading the rest of the thread. Vivek Rameses That's odd, some people think Israel is worst place humanity has ever seen. Sruly J Do you get a thrill connecting politics go something totally not related to that?

Let the Android Developers do their thing as they do it so well. tim242 This has nothing to do with Android... EcE Exactly what he is saying... dump Tizen and stick to Android tim242 I don't think they will be dumping Android. It would be too much of a change for their userbase. But if they were to do that, I would surely dump them. The problem is, I don't care for any other Android manufacturer. HTC is not the proper ODM for Google, too many issues. Drunk Squirrel Did you even read what he said? He clearly said "dump TIZEN", "NOT Android"! Nicholas Conrad I don't think he really reads what anybody says. Drakenoid Which is why I blocked him ages ago and you should too. Middlefinger Yeah, because Android is so great. How many Nexus devices have rebooted randomly today i wonder? MJ That a thing? I don't recall my Nexus 7 which have had for three years ever randomly rebooting. I used a Nexus 5 actively for 2 1/2 years and remember a short period where I had to MANUALLY reboot it a couple of times a week. My Pixel XL has been stable and just as fast/smooth since day one. JohnyNoLegs Pixel XL here, required one RMA, 3 factory resets. Bluetooth is still dodgy. Google Play music is dodgy, it doesn't play for more than 30 mins without stopping audio. LOL at you thinking Google/Nexus?Pixel is any better LOLOLOLOLOL MJ OK, you had a bad phone. So? I have owned more than three Nexus/Pixel devices with no major issues. Regardless, I was responding specifically to the random rebooting issue the OP mentioned that I have never seen. JohnyNoLegs Nexus 5X random reboots. My wife RMA'd it within the first 6 months. 6P battery would die when it got to 30%, RMA'd that and the 6P i got, android system used loads of battery and I would barely get 1.5 hrs SOT even after factory resets. Then bought Note7, was leaps and bounds ahead of the Nexus 5X and 6P, except for the whole risk of exploding....THen I got the Pixel, which yea sure it's always fast at first, but it does so much less than the Note 7, and now my Pixel struggles at points anyway. I have owned every nexus except for the 6, I have also owned nearly all LG G series and Galaxy series. The most Issues I have had are with nexus devices, mostly to do with updates. Airoid Sammy is fu#ked Suicide_Note Hardly. It just means they'll be using Android for a good while longer. shadowx360 Samsung has at least matched (or surpassed) Apple in terms of design and manufacturing of hardware, but is Chinese-OEM level when it comes to software. Articles like these are why I stick with Pixel/Nexus devices. If they want to be taken seriously, they need to find competent software engineers - the GS8 announcement articles were shortly followed by articles showing you can beat the new facial recognition by using a flat photo. Suicide_Note To be fair, you can fool Google's facial recognition with a photo, too. OligarchyAmbulance To be fair, you can't unless you have a photo which blinks. Suicide_Note It's not at all hard to create a photo that 'blinks'. M. Luciano lol? for muggles? Ian Santopietro That actually blinks? No, that's impossible. But it's not hard to make a photo which tricks the software into thinking it blinked, which is why I assume that guy put 'blinks' in single-quotes. Suicide_Note You get it. Thank you. Carson Saldanha He's a wizard bruh Carson Saldanha Yes, that is "Smart Lock" and if I'm not mistaken, I think Google even put a warning of this. They also didn't advertise this as a "feature". Abhilash Bingi TBF Google also introduced the Face Unlock feature back in 2011 (with ICS and the Galaxy Nexus) which could be fooled by a photo. But it warned you that it's not completely safe and can be fooled by a photo when you tried to activate it. Joannaescott Google is paying $97 per hour!

Google likes to whip things up quick and throw spaghetti on the wall to see what sticks. There's lots of mistakes in that process. Also, Samsung specifically stated face unlock is not intended to be a secure locking method. They specifically said it's analogous to slide to unlock, so I don't understand why people are misunderstanding this as a "security flaw" when it's not. Justin That's why Google removed Face Unlock in Lollipop. Abhilash Bingi What? No. It just got renamed to 'Trusted face' and moved to Smart Lock along with 'Trusted places' location and 'Trusted Devices'. It's still an option on my Pixel. OligarchyAmbulance Same here. If this is how they treat their own OS, I have no hope for their version of Android. You're lucky if you even get a security patch from them. byteseyes Samsung's the only company out of all manufacturers that releases monthly security patches actually. Pretty awesome. OligarchyAmbulance No, Google does too. byteseyes I mentioned out of all manufacturers. Google's not a manufacturer. That's why I was pointing out that it makes Samsung special. OligarchyAmbulance The Pixel, Pixel C, Chromebook Pixel, Home, Chromecast, Chromecast Audio, Google WiFi, and Daydream would disagree with you. byteseyes Um, I thought it was quite obvious we're talking about phones, given that we're discussing Android and monthly security patches on smartphones. What does a laptop or a router have anything to do with smartphones? Besides, the Pixel phone was not manufactured by Google. Regardless, this doesn't change my original statement that Samsung is the only manufacturer that releases monthly security patches (for their smartphones, in case I wasn't explicit enough), and nobody considers Google a manufacturer, even with Google's nascent foray into the fringe hardware products you listed. In time, Google may become a manufacturer too. Who knows. OligarchyAmbulance "Google's not a manufacturer." "Um, I thought it was quite obvious we're talking about phones" Google is a manufacturer of many devices. That was the point. "Besides, the Pixel phone was not manufactured by Google" Right, and iPhones are made by Foxconn. So technically speaking, Apple has never updated an Apple device. byteseyes Um, you do realize you're arguing about absolutely nothing right now? I never denied Google updates their phone. I already knew Google updates their phone. I was stating that Samsung, a phone manufacturer, is the only OEM that releases monthly security patches, a direct contradiction to your initial statement "You're lucky if you even get a security patch from them." OligarchyAmbulance "Samsung, a phone manufacturer, is the only OEM that releases monthly security patches" They're the only OEM if you don't include another OEM. lol byteseyes Google's an OEM? Apple's OEM? That's news to everyone. tim242 Android's face unlock was the same. Besides, Samsung tells you that it is low security. You are just a nasty google sheep. EcE While I don't disagree, it's been 5 or 6 years. If Samsung was going to implement it, at least try harder. My guess is that it was a last minute addition due to the rumored onscreen fingerprint sensor they had to ditch. Shame-sung C.E.O Says the Current-C Shill who is a sheep to Swinesung now.

Peter World Citizen Your Korean boyfriend left you recently? ;) Shame-sung C.E.O why are you sharing what your mother told you? Kind of random LOL!! Defenestratus Google's software development isn't by any means stellar either. John Doe It is definitly more secure than Samsung and better designed. Google has a project zero team so find security flaws and it works great...I wonder why they haven't looked at Tizen OS lmao Zsolt V It's by not stellar you mean that it's the best out of all commercial companies you are right.... QwertyJuan To be fair... if you lose your phone, there is a HIGH chance that the person finding it has NO idea who you are, doesn't possess any pictures of you, thereby making the facial recognition feature a decent level of security. No... it won't stop your younger brother or one of your friends from "hacking" your phone when you are asleep. :) P.S. Samsung ALSO has a retina scanner built into the phone which is actually MORE secure than even a fingerprint scanner and for some reason we hear NOTHING about this feature. whispy_snippet It's less secure for the very reasons you just outlined. It's easier to get a photo of someone than their fingerprint. Drakenoid Not if you're a common thief, then it's easier to get their fingerprints off the phone than their pic. whispy_snippet I'm sceptical that a common thief has the tools and/or technical know-how to obtain and then exploit someone's finger print. It's not easy. Drakenoid True, but it's then also unlikely for them to get photo of the owner. My name is…. Oh yes, the classic douche that says "that's why i stick with Pixel/Nexus devices" Because Android was never full of holes or the Pixel deserves the iphone-like price tag. Zsolt V It's better than an iPhone, so why shouldn't it be priced so? Justin You know what's worse than GoPro Sheeps? Nexus Sheeps. YaKillaCJ Hold up now, while I agree that Samsung suck in the software department, I disagree with the Chinese OEM part. Let's not forget that Xiaomi has the best update record, even surpassing Google depending how ya look at it. Also OnePlus has been really good and ZTE not bad at all. Zsolt V What does update speed have anything to do with this topic? jodieisme Security patch..? Zsolt V So Samsung doesn't deliver timely monthly patches? mma173 Xiaomi is a way better than Google. MIUI has so many advantages over the other Android roms. But the one has to admit that they took their "inspiration" from Apple :) especially in the early days. Drakenoid True, I wish they would update the basic usability of MIUI to be more in line with Android, specially now that Android does a lot of things better. They don't have to serve Google's Android just an updated version with better design. I love their features though. Though Xiaomi doesn't provide security patches to Mi 5 as fast as they should. Zsolt V So you 3D print a face, no difference. Adam Truelove Agree, Stock Android managed by Google running on an S8 would be wonderful. Samsung makes great hardware, but absolute garbage software. JohnyNoLegs Samsung states it isn't secure man. SAM I had read about Tizen code and management and no wonder this article makes sense. Read what other programmers had to say abt tizen https://what.thedailywtf.com/topic/15687/code-review-malediction https://what.thedailywtf.com/topic/15001/enlightened Suicide_Note I view Tizen as being akin to the dark language of Mordor, and should never be spoken of. marcusmarcus2 What?

YouNex That's why #NeverSamsung JohnyNoLegs Yea, go with some other small company that must have great developers and code review policies...LOL Audio This has always been my fear about tizen and why I can't buy the gear s3 watch, ESPECIALLY for using Samsung Pay.

Doesn't Knox pre-date Android for Work? Defenestratus Yes it is integrated into Android's Security apparatus and yes, it pre-dated Android for Work (which as far as I can tell is vaporware). saf1927 Android for Work is useful to use it as way to have multiple app profiles. There's an app on the Play Store that create a work profile you can manage yourself by adding apps, etc. LineOS for exynos!

For years i been saying the same-thing. TIZEN OS is just pure Trash. Swinesung has always had lower standards then free boostmobile phones and Software that should be on V-Tech phones at the least( no insult to V-tech). How ever we all know Swinesung is not Special and has never been special. It's just a Sheep Mentality. Good thing there is Nexus who gives you Amazing Hardware and Software not Bloatware and Half baked products like the ones Swinesung makes. Another Fail from Swinesung. Aaron Uh, you know Nexus isn't a thing anymore, right? Middlefinger Samsung probably spends so much time fixing Googles mess on Android for its devices that there is no time for Tizen.. tekfr33kn You mean f-ing up Android - Fix'd it for ya. Middlefinger How can they f it up when they make it actually work without causing the phone to reboot randomly. Thats an Android fault that affects a number of totally different devices, its not hardware, its Googles software, again. Googles UX is just getting old now, and while yes, Touchwiz was poor in places Grace UX is far superior to whatever the hell Google is doing. Its more logical, provides more information in a better way and is fully themeable. Adam Margeson Having owned the original Android device (HTC Dream), a Nexus 5 and a Pixel on top of several others, Google's devices tend to be the more stable ones in my experience. It's other OEMs like Sony, HTC and others that tend to have problems because of code they precariously stack on top of Android. I'm not saying that Samsung's is better or worse than others', but Stock Android has been fairly stable for me. As to "Google's UX is getting old now",.. As compared to what? Samsung's is really just a highly integrated theme on top of Google's UX. Sure, the settings are moved around, the quick settings look a little different, etc, but what about General "Android" is getting old? JohnyNoLegs My experience is the opposite. Having had RMA'd my Pixel XL twice, and had to Factory Reset a few more times, that's more than all my phone prior. Given the latest Bluetooth bugs and Google Play Music bugs, I think you are just floating on cloud 9 oblivious to reality. I have come from Samsung, LG and HTC. My Nexus 5x is a whole other story, it has been even worse haha Adam Margeson My normal vehicle doesn't have Bluetooth, but the rentals I used for several weeks during the time (2017 KIA Sonata, 2016 Ford F350 and 2016 Ford Taurus) that the bug was active didn't seem to have any issues - in fact, they were overly aggressive in trying to connect even when I didn't want it to. I also don't generally use Google Play Music. So, no, I haven't been on Cloud Nine, I just haven't had the same issues other people have. That said, I was hit by the audio-clipping-at-loud-volumes bug that was there for a couple months. That was mildly (/s) annoying. I only factory reset my Nexus 5 a handful of times over the 3.5 years that I used it, and that was more a matter of having far too many apps and background services running to the point that I just reset it rather than cleaning it up. I have read AP every day since I found the site back when the Galaxy Nexus was released, and I am well aware of the bugs other people have been having. I count myself lucky that I haven't been seen most of those bugs personally. Middlefinger None of it is 'stacked on top of stock'. Its a replacement for it, the stock code isnt there. Almost all OEM android is virtually a fork, and there is no reason why i cannot be better than Googles version. whispy_snippet This is the guy who labels people "Google shills". Middlefinger Who am I shilling for? Samsung because I have their phone, LG because I have their TV, or Microsoft because i have their Tablet? Maybe im just not happy with the state of Android at the moment.. Nah, i must be a paid Samsung troll obviously. whispy_snippet So? What's your point? I have a Surface, an LG TV and a Pixel. But everyone knows phones are the most important piece of tech a person owns which is why they generate such intense discussion. You seem like a huge Samsung "shill" and a massive hypocrite. Middlefinger Everyone knows that do they? Sure if you say so, maybe if you are 14. Funny ive been accused of being a shill for Google as well, so it seems to to depend on the bias of the accuser, namely, you. whispy_snippet You're kidding. So you disagree that the smartphone is the most important and innovative piece of consumer technology this century? Mate, what planet are you living on? Middlefinger I didnt say it wasnt (it was actually invented last century, but whatever). I said its not the most essential to everyone. whispy_snippet I didn't say it was invented this century, but whatever. The statement "everyone knows" was an unbelievably poor choice of words and I can't believe I actually wrote it. But my broader point that smartphones are the most important piece of consumer technology this century still stands. My other point, that you're a hypocrite, also still stands. whispy_snippet Oh yeah. For sure man. You got it. M. Luciano This makes sense. Samsung doesn't know mobile security. They have Knox, which they purchased and then had fixed by BlackBerry. We have notifications constantly about people's dryers and refrigerators being hacked, their TV's being hacked and the only way they get out of it on Android is because someone else is handling 90%+ of the legwork, ie. Google. JohnyNoLegs Knox is better than AOSP. M. Luciano I don't believe that at all, but even if true, the point was they didn't create that. JohnyNoLegs Why would that matter who created it? keithzg Because it speaks to their ability to write good, secure software, which is what's in question here. JohnyNoLegs Well they didn't write it, so then it should be great then by your logic. You are also ASSUMING, that all dev's/dev teams/products are done by the same people, which would be a huge assumption that is probably very wrong. Samsung didn't even code Tizen anyway. M. Luciano Because if they'd have built it, they'd probably understand something about security. But they bought it and then had BlackBerry improve it. JohnyNoLegs So thats a good thing right? ast00 At the end of the day, it's still Samsung. Not surprised. Rod Samsung and poor software? Not surprised. Marty What else is new? Samsung's not known for quality software. They've gotten better with Touch-Wiz, but that's their pinnacle. Peter World Citizen All compilers should just mark strcpy() as error. ;) bekifft Worse than this, Tizen runs on refrigerators, and all that other "smart" crap. People are connecting this junk to the internet and forgetting about it. This is the kind of stuff that causes problems like Mirai. JohnyNoLegs Linux runs on refrigerators, and all that other smart crap. Are you saying the devs that made all that smart crap did it better? Andy J So..... um...... anyone know what the SmartThings hubs run on then? Are we facing a potential situation where they could be hijacked. D13H4RD2L1V3 Here's something, though. Tizen technically isn't made by Samsung entirely. It's a project within the Linux Foundation and developed and overseen by the Tizen Association. As you'd expect, Samsung is a member, but so are other companies such as Huawei and Intel. Despite that, only Samsung has actually implemented the OS in their products. Given the shocking number of security holes, I can only assume that it was far from ready. Even though Samsung's Android skin is better than previous iterations, I don't particularly hold it in super-high regard because software has never been Samsung's forte. And I think they should make it so soon as their hardware gets better and better. Đức Thành I am not the least bit surprised, but that part about the legacy of Bada OS living on was particularly hilarious. mma173 Software industry especially OSs is a very specialized resource-intensive field. I wish Samsung should give up working on OSs to free up resources. ROB Can he also work on getting Nougat to the unlocked S7s ?

Google Photos details info page shows you the people inside a photo Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/04/05 5:54am PDTApr 5, 2017 35 Plus 1 on G+ 33 Share on Facebook 55 Share on Twitter Total Shares123 Applications Google News Google Photos is really good at recognizing people in a photo and grouping their pics together. It's one feature I've come to rely on to find all the photos I have of specific friends or family members and even photos of "person X and person Y and person Z" together. But there were still a couple of small things missing from Photos' facial recognition like the option to manually tag a person in a pic or the ability to see who Google had recognized in a photo from the photo itself, not their dedicated page. But the latter is now implemented. Actually, it was implemented at some point in the last few versions: I can confirm that it wasn't there in 2.10.0.148909749 but it is live in 2.12.0.151124741, so it was added to Photos sometime between March 13 and 30. Small details aside, this is a simple but nice change. When you tap in the Info icon on any photo while you're browsing your library, you will see a new People section below Description and above Details. In it are thumbnails of all the people Google has recognized in your pics. You can tap the thumbnail to immediately go to that person's dedicated Photos page with all the albums and pictures they're in. Zaher is a very dear friend with an undying love for Android. I'll make him pay for the free publicity. This is a great way to see who Google has tagged in your photos and to jump to individual people's photos without searching for them first. It still doesn't seem to be possible to manually tag someone in your Photos but I'd imagine the function is coming at some point. Google Photos 2.12.0.151124741 has been live on the Play Store for a few days but it's also on APK Mirror if you prefer to grab it there.

Trying to switch to one of these accounts in Google Photos causes the app to crash, and it has been this way since version 2.10.0 Ibrahim Yusuf You're right it crashes on me too makapav I believe, brand accounts/pages were deprecated a long time ago. vwnut13 Creating a new Brand Account is still available on both Google+ and Youtube. Actually, it's not only available, but there is a direct link to create a Brand Account on the Google+ homepage. Suicide_Note Now we just need to be able to manually tag people in a photo. Capt4chris And for search to include shared albums. :-) chris mellor Im on 2.12 and still dont have this feature. johnforamerica Bring back the damn cloud backup icon on individual thumbnails! Since that went away, no way to tell which photos are backed up! (Other than opening each individual photo) Suicide_Note Agreed. It would be nice to have that back. Dennis Ulijn It'll tell you everything's backed up or how many items still need to backed up. I understand not every solution is perfect for everyone, but what would the clutter of a cloud symbol in each photo solve? johnforamerica It would solve exactly what I described. I selectively back up, I don't want everything backed up. With a library of thousands of pictures, you tell me how to figure out which have not yet been backed up... As it functions now, I have NO IDEA what is backed up or not unless I use one of two crappy options: 1) Click on each pic individually to view the cloud icon showing backup status 2) Try to cross reference my device photos with the web version to see "what's missing" It seems pretty clear to me that Google wants to push its users to use the auto backup function, and this is just another step in trying to compel that usage. Dennis Ulijn Okay, fair enough. Thomas Stockx Is this a US only feature? I've been using Google Photo's for ages on my Nexus 6, 6P, and Pixel, but Google is unable to give me search results for any name. Dennis Ulijn Yes. Use a VPN to enable it once, and then it keeps working. You'd have to put in the names yourself though, but after that it keeps adding photos of that person. Florian Reisinger Where to enable it? Dennis Ulijn I think it's the option called 'face grouping'. I use tunnelbear to create a vpn to america. Ailín Ó’S Apparently it's against EU law or something to do that so it's not in Europe. But once you enable it once it works always. rumanuu76 Yep I visited USA, it started working and now always works 😎 towo Still not available in Germany. *sigh* Fruity101079 With a VPN (or chrome extension), fake your location and access google photos , you will be able to enable it. towo Doesn't seem to populate any face matches, though, or does it just take a long time? Jack Smith I need to be able to tag my pets Fruity101079 We still can't change the location of the picture (don't know why, some of them are completely wrong...) thespacecowboy This has been a feature for a long time. Go to Assistant, then Search, then it'll bring a long horizontal list of photos. Click on those, and it will bring all the people it 'knows'. Click on someone it doesn't know and name them, and it'll tag those people in all your photos so you can search them. therealbiglou Yes, we are all aware. This isn't the point of this article. Rita El Khoury That's not what this is. Re-read the post please. thespacecowboy But Rita. Reading is hard! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/1849b9b0acd9cc0f34a50f0fb75f93662013c9cd00535267a4111a9bffb739c5.jpg 4Ui812 Reading is easy , comprehension is hard. Cecil Hardwood This only works for faces/people Google sees. I have lots of photos that for whatever reason Google has not identified any people in them or maybe 1 out of 3. It would be nice to be able to go back and add the ones Google missed. 4Ui812 You're a good looking lady Rita. It's a nice picture , you should use this one as your avatar. Peter Garlinski I'm assuming you're going to get at least a couple good bottles of beer for giving your friend publicity. Rita El Khoury Given how many times I've screenshotted stuff with him in it, I have to ask for at least one Pixel XL :p Vinayak Prabhu This is completely off topic. I noticed that you are using a S7 Edge.. How has it hold up after a year? Is there noticeably lag every now and then? m33d Rita's eyebrows be lookin' "on fleek!" Rita El Khoury Had to Google that. Thanks :) Kevin Chapple But, regrettably STILL not available in the UK.. ANY idea when this will be 'fixed' for the UK? jwildman16 Some others here stated that you can enable a VPN to a U.S. location, start adding names to faces, and then it will continue to do so after the VPN is disconnected. Matthew Merrick Doesn't matter. My Google Photos facial recognition wipes itself every 2 weeks for some godforsaken reason, rendering the service's most useful ability irrelevant, considering it rebuilds at not even one photo per day. Divya Pant Valuable information on Google Photos. Looking forward to seeing your notes posted. The information you have posted is very useful. Keep going on, good stuff.

AP SEE ALSO Amazon Scores Rights To Livestream NFL ‘Thursday Night Football’ 0:0 One last extra point: Thursday Night Football will still air on... West Coast tech giants Google and Amazon are amping up their offensive to win your eyeballs, your viewing data — and your wallet. On Wednesday, just 24 hours after Amazon announced its first major sports deal — tying up with the NFL to stream 10 Thursday night games — Google laid claim to viewers’ credit cards by debuting YouTube TV, a bundle of 50 major television channels for $35 per month. The YouTube unit, run by Susan Wojcicki, wants to replace your cable company — but the effort went off half-cocked, opening in just five regions — the New York City metro area, the San Francisco Bay area, Los Angeles Chicago and Philadelphia. The TV packages would also be geographically different, a result of local broadcast TV groups that are yet to sign on. YouTube TV is free of charge for the first month though Apple device users will pay an extra $5 per month. Wojcicki, in an interview with CNN, bragged that YouTube is reaching more of the coveted 18- to 49-year-old demographic than traditional TV, on mobile alone. Channels offered on YouTube TVGoogle/YouTube For the first time, she added, “media buyers are looking at YouTube right alongside their TV buys.” That sentiment seems about a month old, in view of the recent comments of advertisers who yanked YouTube ad spending in after finding their spots tied to hate-spewing sites. On Wednesday, YouTube TV’s offerings included a live English soccer match between Chelsea FC and Manchester City — making it stand out from standard cable offerings. Customers can add a Fox Soccer Plus channel for $15 and Showtime for $11. Still, the bundle as structured did not include channels from Turner Broadcasting, Discovery, Viacom or Scripps. AMC Networks said its channels are coming soon. “What’s going to happen when people realize there’s no [complete] March Madness or the NBA playoffs,” said one TV source about the absence of Turner. The bundle does offer Fox News and MSNBC but not CNN. The YouTube entry follows on the heels of Amazon’s streaming TV upgrade. The NFL package will help the e-tailing giant sell more league merchandise and lure users to click on other products, sources said. Amazon will stream games broadcast on both CBS and NBC with the same ad lineup — plus will be able to sell a small number of ads in each break. “Its the Amazonification of TV,” said The Diffusion Group’s Joel Espelien, explaining that tech companies can offer streaming skinny bundles at very low margins. He said the Google-owned live TV bundle was an effort to “move up the monetization food chain.” YouTube TV will be the fourth entrant in the virtual TV space — following Sling, DirecTV Now, PlayStationVue, and will soon faceoff against a formidable force in Hulu’s upcoming bundle and smaller independent offerings from operators such as Pluto TV.

The study, which Google wrote up as a PDF magazine titled “It’s Lit: a guide to what teens think is cool,” was gleaned from surveys of 400 American teens between the ages of 13 and 17 – AKA Generation Z – and 800 millennials between the ages of 18 and 25. Other top brands among the respondents included Netflix, XBox, GoPro, and PlayStation (but not Microsoft or Sony). “For Generation Z, what’s cool is also a representation of their values, their expectations of themselves, their peers, and the brands they hold in the highest regard,” Google wrote in the study. “Cool is an indication of what people pay attention to, what gets them excited, and can often act as a manifestation of their hope and dreams.” The company also noted that male respondents were more likely to be persuaded something was cool by fads and friends, while females were more likely to consider something cool based on how it made them feel. Of the 10 leading topics surveyed, none was considered cool by more than 15 per cent of respondents – 14 per cent of male 13-to-17-year-olds, and 10 per cent of females, considered technology cool, for example. Among males, video games were considered cool by 15 per cent of respondents, while clothes, fashion, and beauty came out on top for females at 13 per cent. And to the likely surprise of no one, more than 90 per cent of teenage respondents reported owning a smartphone. Courtesy Google When it comes to social media use Instagram, Snapchat, and Facebook came out on top, with more than 50 per cent of respondents on each – though Google noted that Facebook is seen more as a platform for “consumption and stalking” than posting, since the latter is seen as “not cool.” Finally, Google asked respondents for their opinions of a wide range of brands, measuring their answers on two fronts: Coolness and awareness. The top 10 brands among respondents, in order, were: YouTube Netflix Google XBox Oreo GoPro Playstation Doritos Nike Chrome Asked why Google ranked so highly in the survey, millennials called the search giant’s signature engine “serious,” while Gen Z called it “fun.” Both called it “functional,” and associated it with “search” more than any other word. “Teens also think Google is cool because it is popular (search engine), innovative (self driving cars, glass), creative (Google Doodles and easter eggs) and has good values,” Google noted in its report.

He waits for the answers he knows he will get — traffic delays, long waits, queues — and then whips out his mobile phone. “Zophop solves this issue.” On the screen, he types in a destination: Churchgate. Two options pop up: one is the fastest route, including permutations of train, bus and walking options, what you could find via Google maps; the other is cheapest. This second option, Mr. Aggarwal says, is very important for commuters. Zophop, the company behind the app, was started by Mohit Dubey (who has now moved to a Chairman of the board position, to give him more time for his other role as co-founder of Carwale.com) and Vinayak Bhavnani in 2014, who is Chief Technology Officer and CEO, with four employees. Initially bootstrapped, in 2015 the company raised angel investment from Anupam Mittal, founder of matchmaking site shaadi.com, and Satyan Gajwani, Managing Director of Times Internet, among others. Mr. Aggarwal, a former investment banker, joined them last year, as Chief Operating Officer. Explaining their business rationale, Mr. Bhavnani says, “Indian cities can barely sustain with the existing public infrastructure. We also noticed the number of modes of transport increasing. The bus ticketing market is around $25 billion.” Zophop now has 15 employees in Navi Mumbai and Nagpur, and offers real-time data there as well as in Indore, Kolkata and Noida. In ten other cities, it provides static information on timings of public transport. Real-time info The app, Mr. Aggarwal claims, is “The only app in India that gives you real-time info on timings and estimated arrival time of local buses.” The app also solves the problem of getting bus passes, by selling them online, he says. “There are only 25 bus depots across the city where you can get the passes. People have to set aside time for a trip to the depots.” The company has collaborated with the BEST in Mumbai and with government bus agencies in other cities to make the passes available. It also has tie-ups with Uber and Jugnoo (in cities where the app is operational), which lets users get a taxi or an auto vusing the app, which he says is another unique feature. Zophop now has 250,000 downloads on Google’s Playstore, Mr. Aggarwal says, but he refuses to divulge the daily usage data. Everything on the app, including the maps and other information, is proprietary, Mr. Aggarwal says. “We have installed around 1000 GPS systems in the local buses to get real-time data on buses.” The app also uses data from 5000 GPS systems already installed by the government on buses. Paying the bills Revenue currently comes from a three per cent commission on the bus passes the app sells. A possible future revenue stream is usage data: “For transport agencies and other companies,” Mr. Bhavnani says, “this data can be crucial to gauge demand and supply. For instance, if a company wants a bus plying a new route, it can get the number of users in that area from our app database.” The company has a simple marketing strategy. “Unlike big companies like Flipkart that think that everyone is a target customer, we focus on people travelling by public transport,” Mr. Aggarwal says. “We put up posters on buses and send our marketing executives to people waiting in long queues at bus stops across the city.” The app’s limitations include that it is currently available only on the Android platform — the founders say this was a “conscious decision taken to focus on the most popular platform” — its limited geography, and its dependence on access to data from government-owned transport agencies, which requires getting permissions and approvals. The founders are not too concerned with Google and other tech companies adopting the idea. “Google, for instance, is not involved in transactional play, like buying bus passes, and has a more distributive model.” Mr. Bhavnani says. However if Google chooses to enter the market, he says that it certainly can. “Google has this feature in more developed economies like the US. But in India, there are a lot of hurdles. It will need employees at the ground level as bus timings change quickly on an ad-hoc basis.” New roads The company is now working on expanding to three other cities, Ahmedabad, Pune and Surat. “Besides metros, even in Tier II cities, the number of public transport passengers are increasing rapidly,” Mr. Bhavnani says. “Bus Rapid Transit Systems are also coming up in a number of cities.” Expansion to a new city will take less than two weeks, provided the required approvals and data access from the government come in smoothly. Besides expansion across cities in India, the company is targeting international markets as well.

The codename for the larger Google flagship phone has just been discovered in the Android Open Source Project (AOSP).  On Tuesday, Android Police reported about its latest discovery in Google’s Android mobile platform development initiative. Before, the tech site only found the codename for the Pixel 2 which is “walleye.” But now the codename for the larger next-generation Pixel is present in the AOSP as well. After looking for new information in the open-source platform, the tech site found the codename “muskie.” Walleyes and muskies are types of fresh water fish found in North America. Google is known for using names of fish for its smartphones. Last year, before the Pixel and Pixel XL were outed to the public, they were swimming in various rumors and reports with their codenames sailfish and marlin. Let’s not forget that even the Nexus 5X and the Nexus 6P were known internally as bullhead and angler before they were launched. The two new codenames are being linked to the successors of the current Pixel phones. Basing on the sizes of the walleyes and muskies, the latter is believed to stand for the larger Pixel XL 2. READ: Google Pixel C has a new look  Another codename present in the AOSP is “taimen,” which is part of the salmon family. Very little about this third codename is known as of late. When it was first spotted in mid-March, it quickly stirred speculations that it could be the working title of a third-generation Nexus 7 tablet. Techies are also not ruling out the possibility that this could be another phone. If it is, then it could be the largest handset out of the three upcoming Google devices.  Unfortunately, there are no details to confirm that these codenames really stand for the aforesaid devices.

However, Android Headlines has learned that other companies like LG, TCL and Coolpad are trying to secure contracts to build the new devices as well.  Google PixelMore Google’s next-generation Pixel smartphones may have just been confirmed thanks to codenames that appeared in the AOSP.

By Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols for Networking | April 5, 2017 -- 20:06 GMT (13:06 PDT) | Topic: Security Google takes web security seriously. When the Google Chrome web browser encounters a payment site without Secure Socket Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption, it marks as insecure. Soon, Chrome will mark any HTTP site as insecure. That's great, but just because a site is tagged 'secure' doesn't mean it's safe. WordFence's analysis of phishing domains found many malicious domains -- those connected with red-lines sharing SSL certificates. WordFence, a well-regarded WordPress security company, has found that SSL certificates are being issued by certificate authorities (CA) to phishing sites pretending to be other sites. Because the certificates are valid, even though they're operating under false premises, Chrome reports these sites as being secure. They're not. Of course, CAs shouldn't issue bogus security certificates in the first place. Unfortunately, it happens.

This problem isn't just with Let's Encrypt. For example, Symantec has been accused of being sloppy with issuing certificates. Let's Encrypt is, however, what the most common CA phishing sites are using now. WordFence found PayPal wasn't the only one being abused. Fake certificates were being issued to sites pretending to be many popular companies such as Google, Microsoft, and Apple. Google looks for fake sites, but, according to WordFence, "malicious sites that have been issued valid SSL certificates take some time to appear on Chrome's malicious site list." In short, "while the Safe Browsing project that Google runs does great work, Chrome users can not rely on it to reliably identify malicious sites and throw up a warning." As WordFence explained: "In Chrome, when you see 'secure' in your browser location bar, it means that the connection between your browser and the website you are connected to is encrypted. ... It does not mean that the domain is 'trusted,' 'safe,' 'not malicious,' or anything else." In addition, even when a "certificate is revoked once a CA realizes they should not have issued it, we show that Chrome still shows the site as 'secure.'" The 'revoked' status is only visible in Chrome developer tools. You can find it by using Chrome's View > Developer > Developer Tools menu on a suspicious site and then clicking View certificate. Not spotting revoked certificates quickly isn't Google's fault. As Gibson Research has long pointed out, "Much of the certificate revocation system is badly broken and doesn't actually work!" The easiest way to protect yourself from malicious sites is to check your web browser's location bar and read the full web site hostname that appears there. For example, a site that presented itself as an Apple site used the URL: https://secure5.apple.com-shop-account-signin. The key is to look at the full hostname between 'https://' and before the next forward slash. If the URL continues on after the top-level domain (TLD name, such as .com, .net, or edu) and before the first forward slash, you're dealing with a fake site. Close your browser and never go to the site again. Google and the CAs know about these problems. Google had no comment on this story, but I'm certain it is working on it. In the meantime, don't just click into a site because it looks secure. Maybe it is 'secure,' but it may not be in the least bit safe.

The Information: Google plans to release a Google Home with mesh networking Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/05 10:03am PDTApr 5, 2017 28 Plus 1 on G+ 25 Share on Facebook 50 Share on Twitter Total Shares103 Google Google Home Google Wifi News Ever since the release of the first Chromecast, Google has been working hard to establish a place in your home. Last year's $129 Google Home was a major release, but it seems like Google isn't stopping there. According to a report from The Information, Google is working on an upgraded version of the Home to compete with the Amazon Echo. From "a person with knowledge of the project," the new product will be a Google Home with built-in Wi-Fi capabilities. Much like the Google WiFi, which was launched around the same time as the Home, it can act as a router and as part of a larger mesh network. This can probably be best described as Google WiFi with Assistant built-in. A person with knowledge of the project told The Information, "They want to have complete coverage of Wi-Fi in the house. Alphabet’s goal is to get more devices in the home that do more. Coverage of Wi-Fi is a huge pain point." I'm a bit skeptical. This new upgraded Home would definitely cost more than the existing model, and support for non-Google networks is unknown. I'm sure the Assistant functionality will work on any Wi-Fi network, but how will it work for networks not using a Google WiFi/new Home as the router? Hopefully we'll find out soon.

Instead of having 4 devices in my house, I could have two - and the cost should scale I'd imagine - maybe $200/device means $400 sunk cost vs. $520. Jimmy Roche So I bought the Google home and the Google onhub, so I'll buy the Google wifi home onhub thing so that I get +3 exp on Google play games when I use my Google pixel on my Google Chromecast over Google fiber FRKSUP #Invested Josh Phillips I have 3 Google Wifi pucks... I also have Google Homes in those same rooms. Makes way too much sense to come from Google, but I very much look forward to this. Chris Sanner I would've looked forward to this *before* I bought two google homes and the three-pack of wifis... OligarchyAmbulance Yeah this seems a bit ridiculous to come out with these after we've all already bought their routers and Home's separately. Morten Ulv I guess people won't need those things in the future. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Now you will be able to put one more google device in the same rooms James Briano Add a proprietary messaging app and I'm sold. Serge Cebrian why only one when they can make several! Suicide_Note Price this one at $129, cut the price of the regular Home to $89. JD No thanks Goog I'll guard my own perimeter thanks. Unless this Router has sticker packs! Ryan oh cool so it's what we all thought the OnHub was supposed to be with its built-in microphone. but now we have to buy both a new mesh system and more homes to replace the old ones. pass. MJ This makes a lot of sense and could save some people a little money. Now, how about a Google WiFi base with a four port switch for people that would like that? Not that it matters to me... I was interested in Google WiFi at one point but decided a router that someone else ultimately controls is just plain stupid. OhYeah! Google doesn't control the google wifi, it's the same as any other mesh network. Also you could just turn off wifi on your current router and hook the google wifi to that to have more lan ports and have googles mesh wifi. MJ Maybe using the word "control" was to strong but you did see this right? https://www.extremetech.com/electronics/245009-google-accidentally-resets-onhub-google-wifi-routers-server-error I don't need any hardware devices (beyond my phone) tried to my Google account. Suppose one doesn't have a working router already or prefers less devices laying around... Defenestratus Don't need it. I have a 3200sqft home and my Netgear R8500 reaches all corners of my home with signal strength enough to stream netflix just fine. I do need about 3 more Google homes though. Since they got it working with the Harmony hub its become even invaluable than just controlling my smartThings hub. Alec M router, modem, tv box, google home combo?? Paulo I wish they would focus on an unobtrusive and inexpensive assistant module with a decent speaker like the echo dot. Put one in every room that doesn't need high fidelity and my smart home is fully voice activated on the cheap. Integrate intercom capabilities and my dream is complete. The echo dots serve my home automation purposes for now but the knowledge graph is really lacking. Let's see if the Nvidia spot ever comes to fruition. Corbin Davenport Yeah, an Echo Dot with Google Assistant would be great. Defenestratus Still waiting on my 2017 SHIELD to get assistant. Corbin Davenport Tablets aren't getting Assistant. Brandon David Obert I think he is taking about the Shield TV kerrhome Add in z-wave and zigbee and we're all set. Corbin Davenport That would be great, actually. So now you just have a mega Google Home to replace your router, SmartThings Hub/other smarthome hub, and speaker. Serge Cebrian #ReplaceAllTheSmartThings!!! Gerardo Sarabia I thought that was the point of all this stuff when they started announcing it. To integrate it into one simple product. But then they made separate products and services that didn't really work together and instead competes with each other. I hope they get it right but seems kind of early for a Google Home upgrade. bekifft No this makes perfect sense based on Google's history. Google doesn't do crazy stuff like "one simple product". They make separate products, that compete. Then they drop support for them and do it all over again. Luxferro I'll never go back to consumer wifi/routers. DistortStatic Meaning? supersanborn Can't wait to see that it's priced greater than the sum of Google WiFi and Google Home. James Sarino I was thinking of getting a second OnHub to increase my range, and a second Home for use at another location in the house. If this revised Google Home/mesh comes out soon, that would be killing two birds with one stone for me! Simon Seems like they are stealing others ideas. This one looks much better. https://youtu.be/pufR8uJAAw0 Frawlz Oh great... now my wifi won't even listen to me. SHunter Cant we just build in Wifi Mesh Router, Smoke Alarm, CO2 detector, and google assistant into ONE device? Then mount it where you would put smoke detectors. (This would be a wired version, not battery) Jose Romero Next year they will unmerge it. JG IMHO, Google should have done this from the start. As I was plotting out how I wanted to set up my house, I noted that I was thinking of putting both a Home and WiFi in the same rooms (the living room and bedroom). These are the two rooms I spend the bulk of my time in when I'm at home. They're going to be where I want to be able to just call out queries to have answered and also where I want to have the best WiFi coverage. Sure, they're snazzy enough they can each be set out in the middle of the room (as opposed to standard "scary alien" looking routers with antennas sticking out of everywhere). But it's still, I only have so much shelf space in each room, and an even more limited number of outlets. Combining a Home and a WiFi into a single unit would save space, there would be less wires to get tangled and one less outlet would be consumed. And while it may cost more than the Home itself, it probably would cost less than a Home and WiFi unit bought separately... lgg4 Makes sense...I've wondered that as looking at our G WiFi and home sitting next to each other in our kitchen 4Ui812 After this is released whats next from Google ? Why it's Google home version 3 which will be released 2 years after version 2. And Google wouldn't be Google if they didn't remove something from that was useful in the previous iteration. Version 3 will lack a voice assistant because ..... Hey it's Google. That's reason enough. bekifft I hope along with this they announce a major upgrade of the existing Home's Assistant functionality. Starting to feel like I wasted my money Nicholas Conrad Don't forget, Home has pogo pins under a sticker on the bottom. Portable battery powered Home with charging base also inbound. Maybe the charging base doubles as the wifi puck. #MakesTOOMuchSense Ordeith All your data are belong to us. -Google Mike I Just a note. This home Assistant is supposed to conjure up the image of a cup of latte.

An Israeli security researcher takes a good look at Samsung's Tizen, labels it the worst code he has ever seen Jordan Palmer Follow View All Posts 2017/04/04 11:26am PDTApr 4, 2017 64 Plus 1 on G+ 276 Share on Facebook 74 Share on Twitter Total Shares414 News Samsung Android is a hulking beast as far as global user share is concerned — hell, it's the most-used operating system in the world, surpassing even Windows (in terms of internet usage). When Samsung announced that it was creating its own open-source alternative to Google's mobile OS, it was not really a surprise. We've had several upstarts over the years, like Sailfish, Firefox OS, Ubuntu Touch, and so on, but all of them have failed in some form or another. There were a few people, however, who thought Sammy could be the one to unseat Google and Android with a mobile operating system that it called Tizen. Whether it's pronounced TEE-zen or TIE-zen is still a mystery (Wikipedia and I say it's the latter), but up until now, word on the integrity and security of the code has been relatively scant. Israeli researcher Amihai Neiderman finally dove into Tizen's guts to see what he could find. According to his report to Motherboard, what he found wasn't good. Niederman claims that the operating system contains what "may be the worst code [he's] ever seen" with signs of amateur mistakes/practices and no less than 40 zero-day vulnerabilities. All of those 40 allow for remote-code execution, which permits nefarious parties to access and assume varying levels of control of a Tizen device. Remember, there are quite a few devices running Samsung's OS, including the Gear smartwatches and some phones. One of the most critical vulnerabilities was in the Tizen Store (the equivalent of the Play Store or App Store), which allowed Niederman to inject malicious code into his Samsung TV (also running Tizen). His conclusion from this was that you as a hypothetical third-party could "update a Tizen system with any malicious code you want." Even the store's authentication measures weren't enough — he just used a heap-overflow vulnerability (which he also discovered) to hijack the software before the security protocols activated. Moving on, Niederman says that Tizen's code base is quite outdated and even borrows some elements from Bada, its predecessor. However, he claims that most of the issues he found were in the new code, which was written in the last two years or so. Some of the mistakes are those one might find programmers making twenty years ago. As Motherboard puts it, this shows that Sammy lacks any basic code development or review practices. To prove his point, Niederman points to one example that he claims was everywhere in Tizen, strcpy(). Basically, strcpy() is a flawed function that is easily exploitable and is not used anymore because of that, yet it is supposedly prevalent in Tizen. To top everything off, Niederman says that the programmers failed to use SSL encryption in certain areas during specific data transmissions. This led him to conclude that they made the wrong assumptions on what needed to be encrypted and purposefully left out SSL in those places. When he initially reached out to Samsung to declare his findings, he was greeted with an automated response. Motherboard's attempts to contact the Korean conglomerate resulted only in the basic PR drivel about the company's focus on security and whatnot. However, after the original article got published, Sammy reached out again to Motherboard to claim that it was working with Niederman to resolve the issues, who corroborated this by saying he was in talks with the corporation. You can read more at the source link below if you're interested. Honestly, I can't say that I'm too surprised. As Mr. Niederman puts it, Samsung should reconsider deploying Tizen to its appliances and future phones before doing a serious overhaul on the code. I find that I agree with him.

(Sarcasm) JohnyNoLegs Lazy coding by coders....SHOCKER!!!! (Sarcasm because even google/apple has shitty code haha) F4LL0U7 But by all means, let's spend $900 on the new Galaxy phone, because I'm sure it's both immune to their terrible code, and totally worth the price tag. Ome Dries The S8 doesn't use Tizen though, so your phone should be safe... your Samsung powered fridge is a different story Leonardo Baez Or their line of smartwatch John Doe Yeah but they probably use the same programmers for Tizen and Android. kalehv I wouldn't think so. Tizen and Android are very very different inside out. demarcmj Probably not the same programmers, but the culture, processes, etc. are probably the same. Just this. the general attitude can't (and won't) be different MJ No... The Android and Tizen programmers are most certainly on different teams and only deal with their platform. This does not mean Samsung as a whole is good at software. John Doe We don't know if they really are on different teams unless Samsung told you. MJ I wouldn't know if Samsung employs cows for programmers unless they told me but I can almost guarantee the teams are separate. Programming teams at any company tend to specialize on ONE project at a time. It's not the same guys... There will be a small number of top programmers who will move from team to to team to fix problems or help with deadlines. John Doe "I can almost guarantee the teams are separate" No you can't unless you are an employee there and know what Samsung is doing. Samsung is not your typical silicon valley tech company so I have no idea how they work. MJ It's funny your whole argument is there is no way we can know how they do it at Samsung yet you had no problem making the statement the Android and Tizen programmers are probably the same which would be a totally unusual setup for any company with large programmer teams. Why not just go with they are probably cows which is why their software is so bad. LOL John Doe They probably are cows :) F4LL0U7 Right, but my point is that their code is crap, and they're making tons of "enhancements" to the Android OS, plus the dozens of Google apps they unnecessarily duplicate. Their terrible code makes a huge impact on the Android ecosystem. tim242 They don't unnecessarily duplicate anything. Samsung has many apps that are far superior to Google's bloatware. John Doe https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e46717cc007988df31954f458f30b8b237b2c4e803101752d08debfaa155bcf3.gif tim242 Samsung Pay>Android Pay Samsung Browser>Chrome John Doe Samsung pay is greater how exactly? And no on the browser I used Samsung's browser it is not as good as chrome. tim242 Ummm I can use Samsung Pay everywhere. As for the browser, you are full of shit. John Doe Umm that is hardware not software, Samsung bought looppay to do that and it has nothing to do with Samsung's software. Chrome is the most used browser in the world...facts. tim242 It is hardware and software, you know like Android Pay uses NFC. You aren't very smart. As for the browser, since when does most used equal best? McDonald's burgers are the most popular burgers, but nobody will claim them to be the best. Do better. John Doe Wow lmao. Looppay uses MST like your credit card so very little software is needed for it to work. You just need to store credit card information. with NFC there is more communications on both ends and more authentication is required. It is more secure than Magnetic strips. But at the end of the day when it comes to software Apple pay and Android Pay are much better (Design, speed, ease of use, etc) I have used Samsung's browser it is featureless. Chrome has a lot of features that I use and it is fast. I save my passwords in chrome, I have data saver, Read later, cached pages for quick reload, Google AMP, autofill is synced, better privacy controls and Do Not Track, Google translate embedded, and fine grain controls for sites accessing camera, microphone, notifications, etc. Samsung's browser is small potatoes compared to Chrome. AbbyZFresh If you've used Samsung's browser, then you would know it's speed >>>>> Chrome is well worth less features in the way John Doe Bitch please you are a bigger troll than Tim and you are a Google hater. Why are you even here? tim242 Your ignorance/stupidity is really showing. MST uses tokenization just the same as NFC. You should educate yourself before commenting about something you know nothing about. Samsung Pay is superior, deal with it. Samsung's browser is lighter, and has more features. You can log into sites with your fingerprint. Try that in Chrome. You can also use an ad blocker plugin. Try that in Chrome. Oh, and it is Chromium based. That means it has a lot of Chrome features as well. Do better John Doe What does tokenization have to do with using the app? We are comparing Samsung Pay with Android pay here and you said samsung pay is better because you can use it anywhere that has nothing to do with samsung pay dumbass that is looppay which samsung bought. It has nothing to do with the actual software. When it comes to the actual app the design, speed and ease of use of Android and Apple pay is better than samsung pay. Chrome still has a lot more features that the two you mentioned. But I can't change the mind of an ignorant troll. A troll is a troll is a troll. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/70cffa9c6cf517883f23a7ea527e30ffa7ecb7b3f6c82e8599d47b0b1cca584e.gif tim242 LoopPay does not exist. Samsung bought it and incorporated it into Samsung Pay, which makes it better than Android Pay. Tokenization means it is not insecure, as you claimed. You are the obvious troll. You make no sense at all. John Doe Looppay is a hardware feature it has very little to do with the app that is like saying I can use 3.5mm headphones with my music app compared to the iPhone. It is a hardware feature but the app at the end of the day is judged separate from that. You are truly fucken moron and deserve a note 7. tim242 LoopPay was the name of a company that no longer exists. MST was bought by Samsung and is part of Samsung Pay. Hardware can't work without software. Why you are trying to separate the two, is beyond me. Take the tech that Google bought from SoftCard/ISIS out of Android Pay, and see how far that NFC chip gets you. You are now on block, as your stupidity is too much for me. John Doe Samsung bought looppay and its patents so you can't have MST on other devices. We are comparing Samsung with Google here so you have to compare only the software not the harware (This whole fucken article is about software and samsung's incompetence). You are fucken retarted Softcard/ISIS was bought for Google wallet not Android pay and it was because carriers blocked Google wallet so Google bought softcard which was made by the carriers. Samsung pay sucks, period. "Samsung Pay's security measures are based on Samsung Knox and ARM TrustZone technologies; credit card information is stored in a secure token.[3] Payments must be authenticated using a fingerprint scan.[6][7] In August 2016, security researcher Salvador Mendoza disclosed a potential flaw with Samsung Pay, arguing that its security tokens were not sufficiently randomized and could become predictable. He also designed a handheld device that could be used to skim magnetic secure transmission tokens, and another which could spoof magnetic stripes on actual card readers using the token. Samsung responded to the report, stating that "If at any time there is a potential vulnerability, we will act promptly to investigate and resolve the issue".[8]" http://www.zdnet.com/article/flaw-in-samsung-pay-lets-hackers-wirelessly-skim-credit-cards/ Middlefinger Just because people are forced to use chrome on Android it doesnt mean its the best. Its the new IE, its terrible on mobile and hardly better on desktop. MJ Who are these people who are forced to use Chrome on Android? John Doe They are not forced to use it. Chrome doesn't come preloaded on desktop but it is still the number one because people go and download it. And it doesn't come preloaded on all Android phones. Middlefinger Yes, it is on every Android phone. If people chose Chrome over Firefox then thats their own problem and its not like FF is perfect either. John Doe It is not on every Android phone. And they choose it because they like it and want to use it. Middlefinger Its compulsory according to the Android licensing agreement, if you want Google play access. John Doe The play store is not on every Android phone...its not on any phone in china for example and the Mobile Application Distribution Agreement is optional and Google chrome is not even set to default and is hidden in a folder on Samsung devices so no one is forcing anyone to do anything here. Middlefinger Its on every phone that has access to the play store. What china does is not relevant to this so dont deflect. You know full well what i was referring to, not that it will stop you claiming victory as is usual on here. Its not hidden, its right on the damn home screen on international unlocked OEM devices. John Doe You said "*EVERY* android phone has Google Chrome". There are plenty of Android phones that do not sign that agreement and do not have the play store on them also the agreement is negotiated with Google including what apps to include. This agreement is also signed with carriers so Google, OEMs and the carriers negotiate it. And yes it is hidden in the US carrier version because I had to go through the app list, open the folder, click on it to use it and also have to make it default...it is not set to default. This was on an S7 edge. https://landing.google.com/intl/en/androidisforusers/faq.html https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-4a46Ko8RE Middlefinger Newsflash, the world doesnt revolve around US carriers.. On the first point.. well done, you won on a technicality that neither of us were even talking about anyway. John Doe That is where OEMs sell the majority of their phones through carriers and specifically US carriers not international unlocked phones which samsung doesn't even update on time (But that is another issue). But even in the international unlocked phone I am sure the S7 also does not have chrome as the default browser. Middlefinger My Samsung devices do, as did my LGs, HTCs and so on (including network branded ones). Some US carriers may have other things installed and set to default, but its the exception in the world. Either way Google requires its bloat be installed, and i dont see that as any better than Samsungs. John Doe You may think is bloat but the billions of Google users out there do not think so go download what you like. Shame-sung C.E.O Swinesung Pay is Garbage. Don't fall for this guys Sheep Mentallity. This is the same person who said CURRENT-C was going to be the winner out of Payment wars LOL!! No joke he was the biggest shill for Months. Shame-sung C.E.O https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d20aef0fbc504aadabb8bd8fde48166d56c8b76806fd4b9f3e699fb0f3c88c9a.jpg https://media.giphy.com/media/l3E6uhDAN3W7vylji/giphy.gif LMFAO!!! LineOS for exynos! I know Samsung browser is based on chromium... But he say 'better' becouse ad blocker... If chrome have ad blocker is will be faster.. that for sure Suicide_Note Two hardly qualifies as 'many apps'. tim242 That was just two examples. Another example is Messages. I have to use Samsung Messages, because Google forces pop up messages, unless you silence them altogether. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages all the time, but I'm not aware of any pop-up messages. Or are you referring to the way the message notification pops up? tim242 Yes, the notifications. Google took the option out of the settings to disable that nonsense. Samsung put the option into their app. Why is Google forcing that on us? It is annoying to have them interrupt what I am doing, and disregards privacy Suicide_Note I like it since i can see if i need to reply immediately or not, or just dismiss it to the notification tray, but to each their own. Good thing we have so many options to choose from. 😊 tim242 Yeah, I would use Google Messenger, if only I could disable that. Knowing Google, they may add that back later. JohnyNoLegs Google doesn't even have an audio recording app LOL. Google has barely anything. Literally BARE Middlefinger amung browser is superior to chrome. A carrier Pigeon is better than chrome, at least Samsung internet actually exits properly when you press the back button. John Doe So go use a carrier pigeon...troll LoL If you like Samsung and their programming skills go buy a Tizen phone Middlefinger I prefer Samsung to Google anyway. Android is a damn mess and getting worse again. Sure 7 is better than the total disaster that was kitkat, but its worse than anything since KK. John Doe Ok so go get a Tizen phone http://www.samsung.com/in/smartphones/samsung-z3/ Middlefinger I prefer Samsungs mods to Android to Googles 'stock', Samsung actually seem to test it before breaking everyone devices. John Doe That is because everyone's device is already broken (Laggy, buggy, slow, and filled with unnecessary apps). Middlefinger Like most of the Google apps, yeah you're right. John Doe Google's apps are updated continually and are stable than the majority of OEM apps since they are mostly updated by OTA instead of through the play store like all of Google's apps. Anyways, that doesn't change the fact that Samsung's software is laggy and terrible...it also gets worse over time which is just sad. And the fact that they take forever to update their phones does not help your argument. Middlefinger Firstly thats horseshit, Google apps are just as unstable as any. Secondly Samsungs launcher can be laggy, jsut like Googles can be painfully limited, so dont use either. The rest of the Samsung mods are better than Googles, especially the notification pulldown. Ive already addressed the update thing. If Google was pushing 7.1.1 to every device in the world there would be hundreds of millions that randomly rebooted. The OEMs test better and it takes time. Older thats stable and fixed is better than newer and broken. John Doe Firstly thats horseshit, Google apps are just as unstable as any. I use Google's apps daily and they are not unstable actually they are highly rated in the play store compared to samsung's apps and are used by way more people that just shows how stable they are. Unless you are using beta version, heck even the beta version is stable so I have no idea what you are talking about. There are always problems with updates even Apple has them with iOS but the difference is Google can push out a fix quickly like Apple. Also with new updates you get security patches and fixes for older bugs that take months to fix when going through OEMs and carriers. If you think Samsung's programming is good go check the article you are commenting on LoL. Middlefinger So what if google can and does patch things quickly, it shouldn't get broken in the first place. This just doesn't happen with most OEM devices, and hasnt to a single one ive ever had. My Nexus devices have been a string of bad hardware, poor software, show stopping faults and RMAs. John Doe I have had several nexus devices and pixel and I have never had severe problems to a point where I had to send it in. There are bugs like any other OEM especially samsung but Google has the ability to fix them quickly. Newflash, it does happen with a lot of OEMs including Apple. This isn't new anyways Google's software is highly praised on the pixel compared to Samsung's "horseshit". Go check the reviews. Middlefinger Im sure the 9 people that have a Pixel just loved the reboots. Nice its fixed, shame it ever happened. Never had severe problem eh? Ive never had ANY with anything except the Nexus'. Highly praised is it? By who exactly? If its the same people that bought the Nexus then they are easily pleased and highly biased. You cant deny there is an entire body of fanboys out there that love AOSP, regardless of how bad it is. If google just secretly used all Samsungs code for 8 it would be the best thing ever, because bias blinds. John Doe 9 people? classy. Nice joke. Never had severe problem eh? Ive never had ANY with anything except the Nexus'. You just lost all credibility just stop. All the tech blogs gave it excellent reviews and said it was the best Android phone available even tech blogs that favor Apple said so and that says a lot. Middlefinger Yeah, OK. Zero Mizukami What didnt you like about kitkat? I was always under the impression kitkat was more or less the pinnacle of Android Audio Totally disagree. There are no Samsung apps on my S7 that I actually use. tim242 That's you. I use Samsung Pay every day, to pay for everything. Samsung's browser is far superior to Chrome. I use Samsung's SMS app, because Google forces pop up messages on theirs. F4LL0U7 That's your opinion, and of course I have my own. It was just a little frustrating when I started my work GS7 for the first time and saw two of nearly every app. As a Nexus/Pixel guy, I'm horrified at Samsung's terrible (in my opinion) design and functionality standards. Not to mention the 3rd party garbage they toss in there too. I had to purchase an app that allows me to disable their default apps. When your first task in the process of setting up a new phone is to wade through and remove the bloat, there's something wrong there. tim242 I purchased a package disabler as well. But I also had to disable a lot of Google bloatware as well. John Doe You need to look up the term bloatware. Lookup, Microsoft office, facebook, and all the other unnecessary apps that don't need to be preinstalled are bloatware. Anyways I don't know what I am arguing with you samsung phones are burning up...literally so unless samsung sells 100+ million s8 they will always be behind apple. tim242 Behind apple haha you are silly. John Doe Why is that silly? They are behind Apple in the smartphone business. tim242 That is not true. Get educated, then comment. John Doe Lmao http://www.techtimes.com/articles/188124/20161208/apple-iphone-7-is-the-best-selling-smartphone-in-us-trumping-the-samsung-galaxy-s7-kantar.htm https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/56f89a4335e2c7fe807cdebf208e142c62b61a5cec127b30c1f4b3c96aee3961.gif tim242 Lmao that is just the S7. Samsung has many other smartphones. You are trying to move the goalposts. Try harder John Doe http://bgr.com/2017/02/03/apple-vs-samsung-sales-2016/ http://www.businessinsider.com/samsung-galaxy-apple-iphone-premium-market-share-chart-2016-12 https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/10/16/samsung-galaxy-vs-iphone-which-product-line-has-so.aspx Apple beat Samsung with 3 Phones....Samsung had 31. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/13806899d2dd953b00745e25586ce63bc99bfb72ae0d42ccd3bbb42fa9c618b5.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78dd8b407e1ea19bc331dea202aae34c0cb0772bea409ff56a11d2efb86e7f9d.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/91444a76a0ec89e25770a31b864244d9c04aad4f64e7c6152e993058b5c82bb9.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/688053d5bd7c128160ba9a9dfe79639b542955188e91c63913e08ee14faa1f85.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e9eb24fa3eae7253df33b2eb97d2250c7c498213eec6de868a759657891aad6b.png JohnyNoLegs Yea like Pixel Launcher, Hangouts, Daydream haha byteseyes Google apps are definitely bloatware. There's tons of Google bloatware I delete every time I get a new device with Android on it. Granted, I think Samsung and Google should get a pass for including their software because it's Samsung's hardware and part Samsung and part Google's software. Completely 3rd party companies like carriers or Microsoft stuffing their software is the worst kind of bloatware. John Doe Google apps are not bloatware because people do use them and they are useful. Bloatware means apps that people don't use and waste space on your device. Google's apps definitly do not waste space and the majority of them are used so no they are not bloatware. These are the apps Google requires most are Google play apps: Google Chrome Google Maps Google Drive YouTube Gmail Google+ (The only one I think is unnecessary) Google Play Music Google Play Movies Google Play Books Google Play Newsstand Google Play Games Google Photos Hangouts (Probably stopped requiring it already) byteseyes Your conclusion that Google apps are not bloatware rests on the premise that people use them. By the same token, Samsung apps are not bloatware because people do use them and they are useful. Realistically, I can count on 2 hands the number of people I've come across who use Google Play Music, Movies, Books, Newsstand, Games, Photos, Hangouts, and Google+. Most people I know do use YouTube and Maps the most, while Chrome is forced onto people often. Drive is a wash. That means almost all of Google's apps are not commonly used, hence waste space. So don't you think it's unfair and untrue to make the assumption that people use Google apps, while simultaneously making the unfair and untrue assumption that people don't use Samsung apps? I personally love Samsung apps and I find most of Google's apps redundant. I can understand if people are vice versa. Haha, sorry, I didn't mean this response to be too long, so all boiled down, Samsung and Google apps are either both bloatware or both not. Hope you can understand that they can not be different. John Doe Fact is that far more people use Google's apps than Samsung's you can check the play store reviews and how many people use them. Google's services are used way more often than Samsung's that is a known fact. Google and Samsung do not release numbers of every single app but Google has a billion+ monthly active users on some of their services. When it comes to the Google play apps, they come in a package with the play store. It makes no fucken sense to have a music section in the play store and no app to play it with. They are a package. Chrome is not "forced" on people. You need to lookup what that word means and Chrome is not even set as default on samsung devices so how the hell is it "forced"? That means almost all of Google's apps are not commonly used, hence waste space. It is silly to make a statement like that So don't you think it's unfair and untrue to make the assumption that people use Google apps, while simultaneously making the unfair and untrue assumption that people don't use Samsung apps? No because like stated above Google has more than billion+ active users on their services and highly rated apps in the play store and they a regularly updated. Samsung on the other hand has even discontinued multiple apps and services because no one is using them like Samsung milk music. https://play.google.com/store/apps/collection/search_results_cluster_apps?clp=ggEJCgdzYW1zdW5n:S:ANO1ljLMiXA https://play.google.com/store/apps/collection/search_results_cluster_apps?clp=ggEICgZnb29nbGU%3D:S:ANO1ljIY5oM Bloatware apps are determined by the user and I am positive that more users find Google's apps in a favorable light than Samsung's. You are in the minority. byteseyes "Fact is that far more people use Google's apps than Samsung's you can check the play store reviews and how many people use them. Google's services are used way more often than Samsung's that is a known fact. Google and Samsung do not release numbers of every single app but Google has a billion+ monthly active users on some of their services." YouTube and Maps are the most popular. The majority of Google apps are not used at all by most people. But that doesn't matter. The point is lots of people use Google apps, and lots of people use Samsung apps too. You can't ignore one group of people even if it's one order of magnitude smaller. It's still a significant number. "When it comes to the Google play apps, they come in a package with the play store. It makes no fucken sense to have a music section in the play store and no app to play it with. They are a package." Many people don't use them. I'm just using your own assumption and logic. I personally deleted them. Whether it makes sense or not to include them is irrelevant. Of course from a company's perspective it almost always makes sense to include their own service. That's business. You're inclined to make justifications for Google but not for others. "Chrome is not "forced" on people. You need to lookup what that word means and Chrome is not even set as default on samsung devices so how the hell is it "forced"?" It's not forced on Samsung devices thank god. But anyway, instead of on smartphones, I was just remembering off the top of my head about the Chrome browser slipping its way into many people's computers, so I was going off a tangent there. "It is silly to make a statement like that" It's pure logic. "No because like stated above Google has more than billion+ active users on their services and highly rated apps in the play store and they a regularly updated. Samsung on the other hand has even discontinued multiple apps and services because no one is using them like Samsung milk music." Again, that's not the case for almost all of Google's apps. Most of Google's apps are not commonly used. Google also discontinues or leaves as zombies apps that no one uses. "Bloatware apps are determined by the user" That's what I've been saying all along. "and I am positive that more users find Google's apps in a favorable light than Samsung's. You are in the minority." Of course a software-centric company is going to have a larger user base. I may be in the minority, but it's still a large number of people. We're not talking about 1 user vs 1 million. If there's 1 user, and an app is installed to cater to that one 1 user, then it would be bad to include the app. But many, many, many people use Samsung apps too. You can't cherry pick what you like and ignore everything that others like. John Doe Exactly so going back to my original comment that Google's apps are not bloatware and that apps from Facebook, Microsoft, and Lookout are bloatware. Also when Samsung has two music apps like Google play music and Milk on their devices and they end up discontinuing Milk because no one uses it that is also bloatware. So I am glad we cleared up your confusion on whether Google's apps are "definitly bloatware" https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/04d006e4bd2b9525b0b0e9550444617ee69614c33bf605ad372243dc9af02410.png byteseyes Logic must not be your strong suit. John Doe Good Job nice comeback byteseyes Thanks. byteseyes I can understand your viewpoint. Me personally, I find most of Google's apps redundant because I really love Samsung's apps. I actually did the same as you haha! I purchased an app to delete all of Google's apps except Youtube and Maps and a few of Samsung's too. I think there are people who use Samsung apps and people who use Google apps. Not referring to you, but some people like to think Google apps are not bloatware because they themselves use them. But many people also love and use Samsung apps, myself included. Even though I love Samsung apps, I can totally understand if people are vice versa. Logically speaking, either both Samsung and Google apps are both bloatware or both not. dabug91 Lol, umm Samsung has it's own calendar app, calculator app, memo app, messaging app, etc and they're all shit. No phone has more bloatware than a Samsung phone. They win hands-down in that category. tim242 I prefer all of those to Google's offerings. I'm glad to have a choice. OligarchyAmbulance You honestly think they have higher standards for their lagfest Android skin? tim242 They have higher standards than Google/HTC with the dumpster fire that is Pixel. John Doe https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a1405ef722a16da1e676294296d43a0d524eaaf5c53be0f4ec6d89b9ab035eb1.gif M. Luciano What? Where are you getting all this? tim242 There have been numerous hardware issues reported since release. Some of which being the microphone, speakers, camera, and the display. tekfr33kn I've had my Pixel for a few months now and haven't had a single one of those problems. I know that a few people have had them but it's more rare than you you are making it out to be. Audio Or for Knox for that matter! Bob http://imgur.com/gallery/UrhOtai Middlefinger No it uses Android, which we all know is perfect/ s ... At least Samsung fixes the mess Google creates most of time though. Jumanji! Are you perhaps conflating user experience with quality/security of code? A company can make something look pretty or function, but that doesn't mean there aren't any issues with the security of their code. Computer science isn't an exact science and creating software is always a series of trade offs. Middlefinger No im basing it on all the problem Google has with its own devices and how much time OEMs have to spend fixing Google code before they release it on their own devices. Jumanji! What do you expect? Android is a big, complex platform and there are a number of OEMs who blend it with their own, unique hardware variations and services. It's absolutely normal for customers to find defects in shipping products. It's ultimately how the company reacts to customer facing defects and issues that really matters. I'd love to see a list of the volume of defects that OEMs have fixed in the Android platform. I think data has the potential of strengthening your arguments rather than having them appear to be nothing but hyperbole. Middlefinger Not all fixes they make is committed back to stock. Much of what the OEMs do is proprietary, but given that OEM devices dont have the problems AOSP based devices do its reasonable to say they fixed something. If all the Google devices had identical hardware you could argue the problem is which specific hardware, but thats not the case. Regardless of the hardware the problem persists because the problems are in Googles code. Zsolt V You are right in everything you wrote. Congrats, finally a sane voice. F4LL0U7 If that was sincere and not sarcastic, thanks! JohnyNoLegs Haha doesn't run Tizen. Fail. Google code their own bugs anyway. F4LL0U7 No shit, try reading the rest of the thread. Vivek Rameses That's odd, some people think Israel is worst place humanity has ever seen. Sruly J Do you get a thrill connecting politics go something totally not related to that?

You'll love it. http://alturl.com/p749b Shuli81 What's even more odd is that it's a paradise compared to whatever 3rd world country you live in Shane DeRidder More reasons to stick with Android proper, Samsung. Let the Android Developers do their thing as they do it so well. tim242 This has nothing to do with Android... EcE Exactly what he is saying... dump Tizen and stick to Android tim242 I don't think they will be dumping Android. It would be too much of a change for their userbase. But if they were to do that, I would surely dump them. The problem is, I don't care for any other Android manufacturer. HTC is not the proper ODM for Google, too many issues. Drunk Squirrel Did you even read what he said? He clearly said "dump TIZEN", "NOT Android"! Nicholas Conrad I don't think he really reads what anybody says. Drakenoid Which is why I blocked him ages ago and you should too. Middlefinger Yeah, because Android is so great. How many Nexus devices have rebooted randomly today i wonder? MJ That a thing? I don't recall my Nexus 7 which have had for three years ever randomly rebooting. I used a Nexus 5 actively for 2 1/2 years and remember a short period where I had to MANUALLY reboot it a couple of times a week. My Pixel XL has been stable and just as fast/smooth since day one. JohnyNoLegs Pixel XL here, required one RMA, 3 factory resets. Bluetooth is still dodgy. Google Play music is dodgy, it doesn't play for more than 30 mins without stopping audio. LOL at you thinking Google/Nexus?Pixel is any better LOLOLOLOLOL MJ OK, you had a bad phone. So? I have owned more than three Nexus/Pixel devices with no major issues. Regardless, I was responding specifically to the random rebooting issue the OP mentioned that I have never seen. JohnyNoLegs Nexus 5X random reboots. My wife RMA'd it within the first 6 months. 6P battery would die when it got to 30%, RMA'd that and the 6P i got, android system used loads of battery and I would barely get 1.5 hrs SOT even after factory resets. Then bought Note7, was leaps and bounds ahead of the Nexus 5X and 6P, except for the whole risk of exploding....THen I got the Pixel, which yea sure it's always fast at first, but it does so much less than the Note 7, and now my Pixel struggles at points anyway. I have owned every nexus except for the 6, I have also owned nearly all LG G series and Galaxy series. The most Issues I have had are with nexus devices, mostly to do with updates. Airoid Sammy is fu#ked Suicide_Note Hardly. It just means they'll be using Android for a good while longer. shadowx360 Samsung has at least matched (or surpassed) Apple in terms of design and manufacturing of hardware, but is Chinese-OEM level when it comes to software. Articles like these are why I stick with Pixel/Nexus devices. If they want to be taken seriously, they need to find competent software engineers - the GS8 announcement articles were shortly followed by articles showing you can beat the new facial recognition by using a flat photo. Suicide_Note To be fair, you can fool Google's facial recognition with a photo, too. OligarchyAmbulance To be fair, you can't unless you have a photo which blinks. Suicide_Note It's not at all hard to create a photo that 'blinks'. M. Luciano lol? for muggles? Ian Santopietro That actually blinks? No, that's impossible. But it's not hard to make a photo which tricks the software into thinking it blinked, which is why I assume that guy put 'blinks' in single-quotes. Suicide_Note You get it. Thank you. Carson Saldanha He's a wizard bruh Carson Saldanha Yes, that is "Smart Lock" and if I'm not mistaken, I think Google even put a warning of this. They also didn't advertise this as a "feature". Abhilash Bingi TBF Google also introduced the Face Unlock feature back in 2011 (with ICS and the Galaxy Nexus) which could be fooled by a photo. But it warned you that it's not completely safe and can be fooled by a photo when you tried to activate it. Joannaescott Google is paying $97 per hour!

Google likes to whip things up quick and throw spaghetti on the wall to see what sticks. There's lots of mistakes in that process. Also, Samsung specifically stated face unlock is not intended to be a secure locking method. They specifically said it's analogous to slide to unlock, so I don't understand why people are misunderstanding this as a "security flaw" when it's not. Justin That's why Google removed Face Unlock in Lollipop. Abhilash Bingi What? No. It just got renamed to 'Trusted face' and moved to Smart Lock along with 'Trusted places' location and 'Trusted Devices'. It's still an option on my Pixel. OligarchyAmbulance Same here. If this is how they treat their own OS, I have no hope for their version of Android. You're lucky if you even get a security patch from them. byteseyes Samsung's the only company out of all manufacturers that releases monthly security patches actually. Pretty awesome. OligarchyAmbulance No, Google does too. byteseyes I mentioned out of all manufacturers. Google's not a manufacturer. That's why I was pointing out that it makes Samsung special. OligarchyAmbulance The Pixel, Pixel C, Chromebook Pixel, Home, Chromecast, Chromecast Audio, Google WiFi, and Daydream would disagree with you. byteseyes Um, I thought it was quite obvious we're talking about phones, given that we're discussing Android and monthly security patches on smartphones. What does a laptop or a router have anything to do with smartphones? Besides, the Pixel phone was not manufactured by Google. Regardless, this doesn't change my original statement that Samsung is the only manufacturer that releases monthly security patches (for their smartphones, in case I wasn't explicit enough), and nobody considers Google a manufacturer, even with Google's nascent foray into the fringe hardware products you listed. In time, Google may become a manufacturer too. Who knows. OligarchyAmbulance "Google's not a manufacturer." "Um, I thought it was quite obvious we're talking about phones" Google is a manufacturer of many devices. That was the point. "Besides, the Pixel phone was not manufactured by Google" Right, and iPhones are made by Foxconn. So technically speaking, Apple has never updated an Apple device. byteseyes Um, you do realize you're arguing about absolutely nothing right now? I never denied Google updates their phone. I already knew Google updates their phone. I was stating that Samsung, a phone manufacturer, is the only OEM that releases monthly security patches, a direct contradiction to your initial statement "You're lucky if you even get a security patch from them." OligarchyAmbulance "Samsung, a phone manufacturer, is the only OEM that releases monthly security patches" They're the only OEM if you don't include another OEM. lol byteseyes Google's an OEM? Apple's OEM? That's news to everyone. tim242 Android's face unlock was the same. Besides, Samsung tells you that it is low security. You are just a nasty google sheep. EcE While I don't disagree, it's been 5 or 6 years. If Samsung was going to implement it, at least try harder. My guess is that it was a last minute addition due to the rumored onscreen fingerprint sensor they had to ditch. Shame-sung C.E.O Says the Current-C Shill who is a sheep to Swinesung now. Carson Saldanha Have I ever agreed on anything with you? tim242 I am not sure. But you should more often : ) Carson Saldanha -___________________________________________- Shame-sung C.E.O This has nothing to do with Apple. SWINESUNG is a huge dishonest,Corrupt,Horrible company who will be always known for stealing , profit, sued, settle. Speculation on what Apple is going to do = Nothing. The sad Truth is that Pathetic TIZEN Garbage OS will always be a Rip off iOS,Android & Windows and WebOS . Swinesung does nothing Original and does it half baked like all its product. FAIL FAIL FAIL. Peter World Citizen Your Korean boyfriend left you recently? ;) Shame-sung C.E.O why are you sharing what your mother told you? Kind of random LOL!! Defenestratus Google's software development isn't by any means stellar either. John Doe It is definitly more secure than Samsung and better designed. Google has a project zero team so find security flaws and it works great...I wonder why they haven't looked at Tizen OS lmao Zsolt V It's by not stellar you mean that it's the best out of all commercial companies you are right.... QwertyJuan To be fair... if you lose your phone, there is a HIGH chance that the person finding it has NO idea who you are, doesn't possess any pictures of you, thereby making the facial recognition feature a decent level of security. No... it won't stop your younger brother or one of your friends from "hacking" your phone when you are asleep. :) P.S. Samsung ALSO has a retina scanner built into the phone which is actually MORE secure than even a fingerprint scanner and for some reason we hear NOTHING about this feature. whispy_snippet It's less secure for the very reasons you just outlined. It's easier to get a photo of someone than their fingerprint. Drakenoid Not if you're a common thief, then it's easier to get their fingerprints off the phone than their pic. whispy_snippet I'm sceptical that a common thief has the tools and/or technical know-how to obtain and then exploit someone's finger print. It's not easy. Drakenoid True, but it's then also unlikely for them to get photo of the owner. My name is…. Oh yes, the classic douche that says "that's why i stick with Pixel/Nexus devices" Because Android was never full of holes or the Pixel deserves the iphone-like price tag. Zsolt V It's better than an iPhone, so why shouldn't it be priced so? Justin You know what's worse than GoPro Sheeps? Nexus Sheeps. YaKillaCJ Hold up now, while I agree that Samsung suck in the software department, I disagree with the Chinese OEM part. Let's not forget that Xiaomi has the best update record, even surpassing Google depending how ya look at it. Also OnePlus has been really good and ZTE not bad at all. Zsolt V What does update speed have anything to do with this topic? jodieisme Security patch..? Zsolt V So Samsung doesn't deliver timely monthly patches? mma173 Xiaomi is a way better than Google. MIUI has so many advantages over the other Android roms. But the one has to admit that they took their "inspiration" from Apple :) especially in the early days. Drakenoid True, I wish they would update the basic usability of MIUI to be more in line with Android, specially now that Android does a lot of things better. They don't have to serve Google's Android just an updated version with better design. I love their features though. Though Xiaomi doesn't provide security patches to Mi 5 as fast as they should. Zsolt V So you 3D print a face, no difference. Adam Truelove Agree, Stock Android managed by Google running on an S8 would be wonderful. Samsung makes great hardware, but absolute garbage software. JohnyNoLegs Samsung states it isn't secure man. SAM I had read about Tizen code and management and no wonder this article makes sense. Read what other programmers had to say abt tizen https://what.thedailywtf.com/topic/15687/code-review-malediction https://what.thedailywtf.com/topic/15001/enlightened Suicide_Note I view Tizen as being akin to the dark language of Mordor, and should never be spoken of. marcusmarcus2 What? Now you just made Tizen sound kinda cool. Jordan Palmer Well done. Bewear Die, T(ouchW)izen, die. YouNex That's why #NeverSamsung JohnyNoLegs Yea, go with some other small company that must have great developers and code review policies...LOL Audio This has always been my fear about tizen and why I can't buy the gear s3 watch, ESPECIALLY for using Samsung Pay. It also makes me wonder about Samsung Knox, tbh... Sruly J Isn't part of Knox incorporated into Android for Work? Audio Is it? I always assumed it was separate... Doesn't Knox pre-date Android for Work? Defenestratus Yes it is integrated into Android's Security apparatus and yes, it pre-dated Android for Work (which as far as I can tell is vaporware). saf1927 Android for Work is useful to use it as way to have multiple app profiles. There's an app on the Play Store that create a work profile you can manage yourself by adding apps, etc. LineOS for exynos! Call island Sruly J Don't remember the article, but this article says that part of Knox was incorporated into Android. http://www.zdnet.com/article/google-samsung-integrate-knox-into-android-eye-enterprise-gains/ Shame-sung C.E.O LMFAO!! For years i been saying the same-thing. TIZEN OS is just pure Trash. Swinesung has always had lower standards then free boostmobile phones and Software that should be on V-Tech phones at the least( no insult to V-tech). How ever we all know Swinesung is not Special and has never been special. It's just a Sheep Mentality. Good thing there is Nexus who gives you Amazing Hardware and Software not Bloatware and Half baked products like the ones Swinesung makes. Another Fail from Swinesung. Aaron Uh, you know Nexus isn't a thing anymore, right? Middlefinger Samsung probably spends so much time fixing Googles mess on Android for its devices that there is no time for Tizen.. tekfr33kn You mean f-ing up Android - Fix'd it for ya. Middlefinger How can they f it up when they make it actually work without causing the phone to reboot randomly. Thats an Android fault that affects a number of totally different devices, its not hardware, its Googles software, again. Googles UX is just getting old now, and while yes, Touchwiz was poor in places Grace UX is far superior to whatever the hell Google is doing. Its more logical, provides more information in a better way and is fully themeable. Adam Margeson Having owned the original Android device (HTC Dream), a Nexus 5 and a Pixel on top of several others, Google's devices tend to be the more stable ones in my experience. It's other OEMs like Sony, HTC and others that tend to have problems because of code they precariously stack on top of Android. I'm not saying that Samsung's is better or worse than others', but Stock Android has been fairly stable for me. As to "Google's UX is getting old now",.. As compared to what? Samsung's is really just a highly integrated theme on top of Google's UX. Sure, the settings are moved around, the quick settings look a little different, etc, but what about General "Android" is getting old? JohnyNoLegs My experience is the opposite. Having had RMA'd my Pixel XL twice, and had to Factory Reset a few more times, that's more than all my phone prior. Given the latest Bluetooth bugs and Google Play Music bugs, I think you are just floating on cloud 9 oblivious to reality. I have come from Samsung, LG and HTC. My Nexus 5x is a whole other story, it has been even worse haha Adam Margeson My normal vehicle doesn't have Bluetooth, but the rentals I used for several weeks during the time (2017 KIA Sonata, 2016 Ford F350 and 2016 Ford Taurus) that the bug was active didn't seem to have any issues - in fact, they were overly aggressive in trying to connect even when I didn't want it to. I also don't generally use Google Play Music. So, no, I haven't been on Cloud Nine, I just haven't had the same issues other people have. That said, I was hit by the audio-clipping-at-loud-volumes bug that was there for a couple months. That was mildly (/s) annoying. I only factory reset my Nexus 5 a handful of times over the 3.5 years that I used it, and that was more a matter of having far too many apps and background services running to the point that I just reset it rather than cleaning it up. I have read AP every day since I found the site back when the Galaxy Nexus was released, and I am well aware of the bugs other people have been having. I count myself lucky that I haven't been seen most of those bugs personally. Middlefinger None of it is 'stacked on top of stock'. Its a replacement for it, the stock code isnt there. Almost all OEM android is virtually a fork, and there is no reason why i cannot be better than Googles version. whispy_snippet This is the guy who labels people "Google shills". Middlefinger Who am I shilling for? Samsung because I have their phone, LG because I have their TV, or Microsoft because i have their Tablet? Maybe im just not happy with the state of Android at the moment.. Nah, i must be a paid Samsung troll obviously. whispy_snippet So? What's your point? I have a Surface, an LG TV and a Pixel. But everyone knows phones are the most important piece of tech a person owns which is why they generate such intense discussion. You seem like a huge Samsung "shill" and a massive hypocrite. Middlefinger Everyone knows that do they? Sure if you say so, maybe if you are 14. Funny ive been accused of being a shill for Google as well, so it seems to to depend on the bias of the accuser, namely, you. whispy_snippet You're kidding. So you disagree that the smartphone is the most important and innovative piece of consumer technology this century? Mate, what planet are you living on? Middlefinger I didnt say it wasnt (it was actually invented last century, but whatever). I said its not the most essential to everyone. whispy_snippet I didn't say it was invented this century, but whatever. The statement "everyone knows" was an unbelievably poor choice of words and I can't believe I actually wrote it. But my broader point that smartphones are the most important piece of consumer technology this century still stands. My other point, that you're a hypocrite, also still stands. whispy_snippet Oh yeah. For sure man. You got it. M. Luciano This makes sense. Samsung doesn't know mobile security. They have Knox, which they purchased and then had fixed by BlackBerry. We have notifications constantly about people's dryers and refrigerators being hacked, their TV's being hacked and the only way they get out of it on Android is because someone else is handling 90%+ of the legwork, ie. Google. JohnyNoLegs Knox is better than AOSP. M. Luciano I don't believe that at all, but even if true, the point was they didn't create that. JohnyNoLegs Why would that matter who created it? keithzg Because it speaks to their ability to write good, secure software, which is what's in question here. JohnyNoLegs Well they didn't write it, so then it should be great then by your logic. You are also ASSUMING, that all dev's/dev teams/products are done by the same people, which would be a huge assumption that is probably very wrong. Samsung didn't even code Tizen anyway. M. Luciano Because if they'd have built it, they'd probably understand something about security. But they bought it and then had BlackBerry improve it. JohnyNoLegs So thats a good thing right? ast00 At the end of the day, it's still Samsung. Not surprised. Rod Samsung and poor software? Not surprised. Marty What else is new? Samsung's not known for quality software. They've gotten better with Touch-Wiz, but that's their pinnacle. Peter World Citizen All compilers should just mark strcpy() as error. ;) bekifft Worse than this, Tizen runs on refrigerators, and all that other "smart" crap. People are connecting this junk to the internet and forgetting about it. This is the kind of stuff that causes problems like Mirai. JohnyNoLegs Linux runs on refrigerators, and all that other smart crap. Are you saying the devs that made all that smart crap did it better? Andy J So..... um...... anyone know what the SmartThings hubs run on then? Are we facing a potential situation where they could be hijacked. D13H4RD2L1V3 Here's something, though. Tizen technically isn't made by Samsung entirely. It's a project within the Linux Foundation and developed and overseen by the Tizen Association. As you'd expect, Samsung is a member, but so are other companies such as Huawei and Intel. Despite that, only Samsung has actually implemented the OS in their products. Given the shocking number of security holes, I can only assume that it was far from ready. Even though Samsung's Android skin is better than previous iterations, I don't particularly hold it in super-high regard because software has never been Samsung's forte. And I think they should make it so soon as their hardware gets better and better. Đức Thành I am not the least bit surprised, but that part about the legacy of Bada OS living on was particularly hilarious. mma173 Software industry especially OSs is a very specialized resource-intensive field. I wish Samsung should give up working on OSs to free up resources. ROB Can he also work on getting Nougat to the unlocked S7s ?

By Stephanie Condon | April 5, 2017 -- 19:11 GMT (12:11 PDT) | Topic: Hardware Google on Wednesday shared some details regarding the performance of its custom-built Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) chip. Designed for machine learning and tailored for TensorFlow, Google's open-source machine learning framework, TPUs have been powering Google datacenters since 2015. This first generation of TPUs, Google noted, have targeted inference -- the use of an already trained model, as opposed to the training phase of a model. On production AI workloads that utilize neural network inference, the TPU is 15 times to 30 times faster than contemporary GPUs and CPUs, Google said. Additionally, the TPU is much more energy efficient, delivering a 30 times to 80 times improvement in TOPS/Watt measure (tera-operations [trillion or 1012 operations] of computation per Watt of energy consumed). Without the TPU, the computational expense of its deep learning models would have been tremendous Google said. "If we considered a scenario where people use Google voice search for just three minutes a day and we ran deep neural nets for our speech recognition system on the processing units we were using, we would have had to double the number of Google datacenters!" wrote Google hardware engineer Norm Jouppi. The TPU details were shared ahead of a talk at the Computer History Museum in Silicon Valley, and they're included in a study with more than 70 contributors.

If you’re a fan of Google’s Open Source projects, I guess you could say it’s Christmas all over again… Book a Free Smart Home Consultation w/ Amazon Services Last year’s Santa Tracker brought a lot of improvements across its respective web and Android versions. But while they were the most feature-packed versions of Santa Tracker ever, they also took advantage of a lot of great technologies in the background — like Firebase, Polymer, Web Share API, and more. Per the Google Developers blog: Today, we’re continuing the season of giving by delivering the updated open-source versions of both the Web and Android versions that ran in December 2016. These are large, real-world apps that show off the latest and greatest from Google—using APIs and frameworks like Firebase and Polymer. You can find the source code over on GitHub at google/santa-tracker-web and google/santa-tracker-android, and detailed build instructions are included for both versions.

Google's online package of about 40 television channels debuts on Wednesday, April 5, 2017, in the tech industry's latest bid to get cable-shunning millennials to pay for television. (AP Photo/Reed Saxon, File) .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........NEW YORK — YouTube TV, Google’s new streaming package of about 40 television channels, is the tech industry’s latest bid to get cable-shunning millennials to pay for live TV over the internet. It offers intriguing advantages over rivals, but it remains hobbled by a limited channel selection. Don’t confuse the YouTube service, which debuts Wednesday, with Netflix, Amazon Prime and other streaming offerings. Like similar efforts from Sony, Dish and AT&T’s DirecTV , YouTube TV primarily aims to let you channel surf over the internet, not to stream from an online library of shows and movies. So these internet-cable services can offer live programming, especially sports. But they also come with some serious drawbacks. While these services are typically cheaper than traditional cable or satellite services, people haven’t been signing up in droves. Google is targeting viewers who have never subscribed to cable or satellite TV and are just as happy to get all their video from the internet; getting them to cough up $35 a month could be a hard sell. Google aims to lure subscribers with more sophisticated program search, personalized recommendations and a more fully featured online DVR than rival services offer. But it faces many of the limitations its rivals have. Advertisement Continue reading YouTube TV, for instance, features staples such as ESPN and major broadcast networks, but lacks key networks such as PBS, CNN and Comedy Central. And it will initially be only available in a handful of major U.S. cities because media rights are still stuck in the 20th century . ___ WHAT YOU GET … AND WHAT YOU DON’T YouTube TV offers plenty of live sports, one of the chief reasons people stick with cable. Pick a team, and the service automatically records all the televised games it can find. Available channels include ESPN, Big Ten and sports networks from Comcast, Fox and CBS — but not Turner networks such as TBS and others that aired the bulk of March Madness. New York Mets fans won’t get baseball games on SNY. YouTube also has the youth-oriented Freeform and CW networks; its rivals lack The CW. AMC is coming in a few weeks, so you’ll have to wait to catch up on the just-ended season of “The Walking Dead.” Since most channel numbers and names are meaningless in a digital world, YouTube TV arranges live channels by topic, starting with broadcast networks, sports, youth-oriented channels, then everything else. Subscriptions are initially limited to New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia and the San Francisco Bay Area — all locations where YouTube could get rights to local ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC stations. ___ SEARCH PARTY Advertisement Continue reading As you’d expect from Google, search is one of YouTube’s big selling points. Its rivals already offer search by shows and sometimes by actors; YouTube adds topical searches, such as “aliens” or “road trips.” Unfortunately, it’s still a work in progress. A search for “nerd comedy” brings up “The Big Bang Theory,” but “comedy about nerds” does not. And a search for “Modern Family episode on basketball” doesn’t bring up the episode titled “Basketball.” YouTube could also stand to take a cue from TiVo recorders and let you automatically record all programs featuring, say, Jennifer Lawrence, including her talk-show appearances. You can search for Jennifer Lawrence, but you need to go through the results and choose shows to record individually — too much work for a service that promises simplicity. One big plus: YouTube’s unlimited DVR will store recordings for nine months, long enough for entire seasons of network shows. Sony’s PlayStation Vue — the only similar service offering an unlimited online DVR — offers only 28 days of storage, nowhere near enough for binge-watching. YouTube TV works on phones, tablets and laptop browsers. Watching on an actual TV requires Google’s Chromecast, an inexpensive streaming stick you control with your phone. (Early subscribers get one for free.) ___ ABOUT YOUR PRIVACY This being Google, your viewing and search histories might be mined for targeted advertising. You can suspend tracking in the settings, though that will hinder personalized recommendations. (It’s too early to tell if that’s a loss or not, though some of the early recommendations have been spot on.) You can share your subscription with five friends or relatives in your household, with three simultaneous streams allowed. No need to share passwords; they sign in with their own Google accounts. Recordings and recommendations are kept separate, so your roommates can’t make fun of you for bingeing “The Real Housewives.” Share Tweet LinkedIn Email Print Subscribe Most Recent Biz News Suggested Stories: Hyundai replaces General Motors as NFL auto sponsor – Jun 29, 2015 California: Self-driving cars must have driver behind wheel – Dec 16, 2015 San Francisco battles epidemic of auto burglaries – Jun 13, 2016 Police: Colts' David Parry arrested in Scottsdale, Arizona – Feb 28, 2017 Advertisement Comments Subscribe to the Journal for only $12.

Elyse Betters5 April 2017Apps YouTube TV Stream live sports, ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC, and more Never run out of DVR storage space Six users can watch simultaneously for $35/month No commitments - you can cancel at any time Now available in the 'largest US markets' Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment It's been long rumoured that Google will use YouTube to introduce a live TV service. The company has now confirmed those suspicions. Google officially launched its entry into the streaming of live TV, with YouTube TV. It lets you access live and recorded content from major networks typically found on cable. It is available alongside YouTube's existing content, and it works on practically every screen you can watch YouTube on, but it only costs $35 a month without a contract. Here's everything you need to know about it. What is Android TV, how does it work, and which devices offer it? Which is the best movie streaming box for under £150? Android TV vs Samsung Tizen vs Firefox OS vs LG webOS What is YouTube TV? When people watch TV, they tune into live sports, breaking news, sitcoms, dramas, and a number of other different types of programmes. Although there is a tonne of content to choose from, there are limitations to how you can watch it. You simply can't watch TV when you want and on any screen without a contract. And you certainly don't always have access to fancy TV features such as DVR. YouTube TV is attempting to change that. It is described as "live TV designed for the YouTube generation - those who want to watch what they want, when they want, how they want, without commitments." What channels are on YouTube TV? Google said the initial lineup of "more than 40 networks" includes CBS, Fox, NBC, and CBS, as well as cable players USA and FX. There's a total of 10 sports networks available, including ESPN, Fox Sports, and NBCSN. Local affiliates will also be included, so you can watch news from the same channels you'd normally get over the air. You can even add Showtime for an additional price. Which is the best movie streaming service in the UK? It's safe to say YouTube TV directly competes with existing services such as Sling TV and PlayStation Vue, both of which offer access to live TV from major networks, cable players, and sports networks. But there are some holes - like Viacom, Discovery, A&E, AMC, and Turner (with TBS and TNT). Sony's $35 plan for PlayStation Vue offers many of these networks and more, such as CNN. YouTube TV You can see the full YouTube TV channel lineup above. There's also a couple add-on packages you can buy at launch: Showtime ($11 per month) and Fox Soccer Plus ($15 per month). What does YouTube TV feature? Unlimited cloud DVR storage Apart from live TV from major networks, YouTube TV includes unlimited cloud DVR storage. With that feature, you can even add a show or sports team to your favourites, and it'll automatically save them for you. Your cloud DVR records as many shows as you want, simultaneously, without using data or space on your phone (though you can stream recordings from any device at any time). Google said it stores each of your recordings for nine months. And, yes, you can fast forward or rewind DVR content, so you can quickly pass right over all those annoying commercials. Available across all your screens YouTube TV works on both Android and iOS. That means you can watch YouTube TV on your phone, tablet, or computer. You can also stream to your TV with a Google Chromecast or Chromecast built-in TV. YouTube TV will even eventually work with Google Home, too, allowing you to ask Home to play a show on your Chromecast. Google said it'll "just work," according to Engadget. How does YouTube TV work? YouTube TV YouTube TV app Now that YouTube TV has launched, you can access it from the new YouTube TV app for Android and iOS or from the web on your computer. Other devices (like Apple TV, Roku, the PS4, and Xbox One) don't have access to the new YouTube TV app at launch. However, the mobile app has a "cast" button available at the top throughout, so you can throw a video to your Chromecast or a compatible TV. The mobile app features just three main screens: live, library and home. But it also has universal search (located at the top; can be accessed from most screens), allowing you to search for content by genre, network, and categories. You can search for something like "dogs" and get a list of programmes that feature dogs. If you choose to search a series, you will see a page with all the episodes. Live Live shows what is currently being broadcasted by networks, with live previews of what's on each channel. Just tap to start playing. To record something to watch later, you can tap a plus icon on the preview. When watching in portrait mode, you'll see recommendations at the bottom, or you can flip the phone to landscape to enter full screen. It's worth noting that because of Verizon's deal with the NFL, you can't watch NFL games on your phone. You'll be able to stream them on the desktop or a TV, but not on your mobile device. Library Library shows everything you've recorded and everything scheduled to be recorded on your DVR. Home Home is kind of like what you see on YouTube. It'll show what you've watched recently, as well as recommendations based on what you've watched so far, and you'll see things you may have stopped and might want to continue playing. Support Google told Engadget that you can contact customer service through the YouTube TV app any time, either via text chat or voice chat. Is this different from YouTube Red? This is a separate product from YouTube Red, a service Google launched in 2015 as a way to give you an ad-free YouTube experience. YouTube Red does feature some original programming, but with a YouTube TV membership, you can watch YouTube Red Original series and movies via the new YouTube TV app. But, unfortunately, you won't get the full ad-free YouTube experience. You can learn more about YouTube Red from Pocket-lint's guide. When will YouTube TV be available? The YouTube TV app is now available. Where is YouTube TV available? At launch, YouTube TV is only be available to customers in the US. It is limited to "the largest US markets" but will quickly expand to cover more cities across the country, Google said. How much does YouTube TV cost? YouTube TV costs customers $35 a month with no contract. You can cancel at any time. Up to six users can access content when they want - and they each have access to their own recommendations and personal cloud DVR storage. Note: It’s $35 per month, but signing up from an iPhone or iPad makes the monthly bill jump up to $39.99 (plus taxes and fees). If you sign up from Android or the web, it’s $35 (plus taxes and fees).

The Information: Google plans to release a Google Home with mesh networking Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/05 10:03am PDTApr 5, 2017 28 Plus 1 on G+ 25 Share on Facebook 50 Share on Twitter Total Shares103 Google Google Home Google Wifi News Ever since the release of the first Chromecast, Google has been working hard to establish a place in your home. Last year's $129 Google Home was a major release, but it seems like Google isn't stopping there. According to a report from The Information, Google is working on an upgraded version of the Home to compete with the Amazon Echo. From "a person with knowledge of the project," the new product will be a Google Home with built-in Wi-Fi capabilities. Much like the Google WiFi, which was launched around the same time as the Home, it can act as a router and as part of a larger mesh network. This can probably be best described as Google WiFi with Assistant built-in. A person with knowledge of the project told The Information, "They want to have complete coverage of Wi-Fi in the house. Alphabet’s goal is to get more devices in the home that do more. Coverage of Wi-Fi is a huge pain point." I'm a bit skeptical. This new upgraded Home would definitely cost more than the existing model, and support for non-Google networks is unknown. I'm sure the Assistant functionality will work on any Wi-Fi network, but how will it work for networks not using a Google WiFi/new Home as the router? Hopefully we'll find out soon.

Instead of having 4 devices in my house, I could have two - and the cost should scale I'd imagine - maybe $200/device means $400 sunk cost vs. $520. Jimmy Roche So I bought the Google home and the Google onhub, so I'll buy the Google wifi home onhub thing so that I get +3 exp on Google play games when I use my Google pixel on my Google Chromecast over Google fiber FRKSUP #Invested Josh Phillips I have 3 Google Wifi pucks... I also have Google Homes in those same rooms. Makes way too much sense to come from Google, but I very much look forward to this. Chris Sanner I would've looked forward to this *before* I bought two google homes and the three-pack of wifis... OligarchyAmbulance Yeah this seems a bit ridiculous to come out with these after we've all already bought their routers and Home's separately. Morten Ulv I guess people won't need those things in the future. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Now you will be able to put one more google device in the same rooms James Briano Add a proprietary messaging app and I'm sold. Serge Cebrian why only one when they can make several! Suicide_Note Price this one at $129, cut the price of the regular Home to $89. JD No thanks Goog I'll guard my own perimeter thanks. Unless this Router has sticker packs! Ryan oh cool so it's what we all thought the OnHub was supposed to be with its built-in microphone. but now we have to buy both a new mesh system and more homes to replace the old ones. pass. MJ This makes a lot of sense and could save some people a little money. Now, how about a Google WiFi base with a four port switch for people that would like that? Not that it matters to me... I was interested in Google WiFi at one point but decided a router that someone else ultimately controls is just plain stupid. OhYeah! Google doesn't control the google wifi, it's the same as any other mesh network. Also you could just turn off wifi on your current router and hook the google wifi to that to have more lan ports and have googles mesh wifi. MJ Maybe using the word "control" was to strong but you did see this right? https://www.extremetech.com/electronics/245009-google-accidentally-resets-onhub-google-wifi-routers-server-error I don't need any hardware devices (beyond my phone) tried to my Google account. Suppose one doesn't have a working router already or prefers less devices laying around... Defenestratus Don't need it. I have a 3200sqft home and my Netgear R8500 reaches all corners of my home with signal strength enough to stream netflix just fine. I do need about 3 more Google homes though. Since they got it working with the Harmony hub its become even invaluable than just controlling my smartThings hub. Alec M router, modem, tv box, google home combo?? Paulo I wish they would focus on an unobtrusive and inexpensive assistant module with a decent speaker like the echo dot. Put one in every room that doesn't need high fidelity and my smart home is fully voice activated on the cheap. Integrate intercom capabilities and my dream is complete. The echo dots serve my home automation purposes for now but the knowledge graph is really lacking. Let's see if the Nvidia spot ever comes to fruition. Corbin Davenport Yeah, an Echo Dot with Google Assistant would be great. Defenestratus Still waiting on my 2017 SHIELD to get assistant. Corbin Davenport Tablets aren't getting Assistant. Brandon David Obert I think he is taking about the Shield TV kerrhome Add in z-wave and zigbee and we're all set. Corbin Davenport That would be great, actually. So now you just have a mega Google Home to replace your router, SmartThings Hub/other smarthome hub, and speaker. Serge Cebrian #ReplaceAllTheSmartThings!!! Gerardo Sarabia I thought that was the point of all this stuff when they started announcing it. To integrate it into one simple product. But then they made separate products and services that didn't really work together and instead competes with each other. I hope they get it right but seems kind of early for a Google Home upgrade. bekifft No this makes perfect sense based on Google's history. Google doesn't do crazy stuff like "one simple product". They make separate products, that compete. Then they drop support for them and do it all over again. Luxferro I'll never go back to consumer wifi/routers. DistortStatic Meaning? supersanborn Can't wait to see that it's priced greater than the sum of Google WiFi and Google Home. James Sarino I was thinking of getting a second OnHub to increase my range, and a second Home for use at another location in the house. If this revised Google Home/mesh comes out soon, that would be killing two birds with one stone for me! Simon Seems like they are stealing others ideas. This one looks much better. https://youtu.be/pufR8uJAAw0 Frawlz Oh great... now my wifi won't even listen to me. SHunter Cant we just build in Wifi Mesh Router, Smoke Alarm, CO2 detector, and google assistant into ONE device? Then mount it where you would put smoke detectors. (This would be a wired version, not battery) Jose Romero Next year they will unmerge it. JG IMHO, Google should have done this from the start. As I was plotting out how I wanted to set up my house, I noted that I was thinking of putting both a Home and WiFi in the same rooms (the living room and bedroom). These are the two rooms I spend the bulk of my time in when I'm at home. They're going to be where I want to be able to just call out queries to have answered and also where I want to have the best WiFi coverage. Sure, they're snazzy enough they can each be set out in the middle of the room (as opposed to standard "scary alien" looking routers with antennas sticking out of everywhere). But it's still, I only have so much shelf space in each room, and an even more limited number of outlets. Combining a Home and a WiFi into a single unit would save space, there would be less wires to get tangled and one less outlet would be consumed. And while it may cost more than the Home itself, it probably would cost less than a Home and WiFi unit bought separately... lgg4 Makes sense...I've wondered that as looking at our G WiFi and home sitting next to each other in our kitchen 4Ui812 After this is released whats next from Google ? Why it's Google home version 3 which will be released 2 years after version 2. And Google wouldn't be Google if they didn't remove something from that was useful in the previous iteration. Version 3 will lack a voice assistant because ..... Hey it's Google. That's reason enough. bekifft I hope along with this they announce a major upgrade of the existing Home's Assistant functionality. Starting to feel like I wasted my money Nicholas Conrad Don't forget, Home has pogo pins under a sticker on the bottom. Portable battery powered Home with charging base also inbound. Maybe the charging base doubles as the wifi puck. #MakesTOOMuchSense Ordeith All your data are belong to us. -Google Mike I Just a note. This home Assistant is supposed to conjure up the image of a cup of latte.

The company came out with this $129 device just last year and it’s part of Google’s growing portfolio of devices that are meant to find a place in your home. Today’s report suggests that the new Google Home that’s now being developed is going to have Wi-Fi mesh networking support. Citing “a person with knowledge of the project,” The Information reports that the new Google Home is going to have Wi-Fi capabilities built-in. This means that it will be able to double as a router and also be part of a big Wi-Fi mesh network. The scribe also hears that Google wants to have complete coverage of Wi-Fi in the house with this product and its goal is to get more of its devices in customers’ homes that can do more. Coverage of Wi-Fi remains a huge pain point and it’s looking to address that with the new Google Home. It goes without saying that the new device will have Assistant built-in given that the existing Google Home already does. However, given the additional functionality which requires extra hardware, it’s very likely that the new Google Home might be more expensive than the $129 price tag that has been slapped on the existing model. Google hasn’t said anything officially about this just yet so take this information with a grain of salt for now. Filed in Gadgets.

Earlier this year, Google confirmed an Android 7.1.2 update for its Pixel and Nexus-branded devices. The company then put the Android 7.1.2 Nougat update into beta ahead of an unannounced release for the Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, and others. In early April, Google pulled the Nexus 5X Android 7.1.2 Nougat update from beta and began rolling it out to device owners around the world. Android 7.1.2 isn’t as big as Android 7.1.1 or Android 7.0 but it’s an important update for the Nexus 5X and that’s precisely why we’re taking a close look at it today. The Nexus 5X Android 7.1.2 update is a maintenance release which means its focused on improving performance. That said, it also comes with some brand new features including a useful fingerprint scanner gesture. It’s a substantial release for the Nexus 5X. Today we want to go over the most important things you know to know, right now, about the Nexus 5X Android 7.1.2 update, its roll out, its problems, and its performance. We also include some tips that might help you get through the update unscathed. Nexus 5X Android 7.1.2 Impressions & Performance   1 / 9 We recently received the Nexus 5X Android 7.1.2 update Over-the-Air (OTA), a sign that Google's roll out is making progress.  If you're waiting for the Nexus 5X Android 7.1.2 OTA, here are a few things to know about the download/installation process.  The device's Android 7.1.2 update is several hundred MB. It took us a couple of minutes to download over a high-speed Wi-Fi network. The installation process took much longer, around 10 minutes or so. We recommend putting aside 15-20 minutes to monitor the Android 7.1.2 download and installation. We didn't run into any problems but you might.  We've been using the update for only a short time but so far, the Android 7.1.2 update has been performing well on our Nexus 5X.  Battery life is excellent. We haven't noticed any weird drain during our time with the new software. Connectivity is also strong and we haven't noticed any issues with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or cellular data. At least not yet.  The phone's UI is still fast. That's important for a device that was first released all the way back in 2015. Hard to believe its been that long since launch.  We haven't run into any bugs or serious problems but again we've only been using the Android 7.1.2 update for a couple of days now.  Given what's on board (security patches, new features, bug fixes) and given its steady performance, you'll definitely want to consider installing it on your Nexus 5X.  If you're having a pleasant experience on Android 7.1.2 or below, be sure to take your time. Dig into additional feedback if you start feeling leery. We'll be back with long term feedback about its performance next week.    1 / 9 One Response 04/05/2017 Joe Reply I encountered some serious problems with 7.1.2 on my Nexus 6P, so much so that I had to roll back to 7.1.1. Furthermore, when I rolled back, I repeatedly saw dialog boxes telling me that a system app (I think something with the word “core” in the name) had crashed; every time I’d dismiss one, another would pop up. I had to do a factory reset to eliminate the problem. Anyway, the problems I experienced with 7.1.2 were: no notification (status) bar; no ability to access Quick Settings or notifications except from the home screen; the background, text, and icons in Quick Settings were all white, making them nearly unreadable (fortunately, the text/icons and background were a slightly different shade of white from each other!); USB audio was broken, resulting in my USB audio interface crashing my USB audio applications.

Schoology, the leader in learning management systems (LMS) for education, today announced major enhancements to its integration with Google Drive. The updates will allow students and educators to more easily use Google Drive while working inside of Schoology to manage grades, assignments and student submissions. “Many of our educators love using Google Drive and Schoology, but require deeper integration to leverage the best of both platforms,” said Ryan Hwang, VP of Product for Schoology. “The best workflow for educators and students is where Google content is leveraged seamlessly within the Schoology user experience.” The new enhancements allow for students, educators and administrators to: Easily search, browse and use Google Docs directly from within Schoology Distribute a unique copy of a Google Doc to every student in the class from within Schoology Monitor student progress on an assignment in real-time without leaving Schoology Submit their assignments back to the instructor with a single click Place grades and feedback on the Google document within Schoology “I work with a lot of schools and districts on effectively implementing technology into their teaching. I am a huge champion of both Google Apps for Education and Schoology. Schoology’s enhanced Google integration will make it easier to leverage Schoology to organize, distribute and assign Google content to your students,” said Katie Siemer, Instructional Technology Specialist, West Clermont School District in West Clermont, Ohio. This update will streamline the experience of using Google tools a within Schoology for teachers, students and administrators. Educators will be able to easily search for documents by keyword, reducing time spent looking for documents. The new integration makes it possible to use Google’s native commenting features from the context of your Schoology assignment.  This allows both students and educators to use Google’s inline commenting for assignment-specific communication as well as Schoology’s full grading experience, including the use of rubrics, comments and grades. This way, collaboration and communication are never lost. “I truly believe that the best way to use Google tools in a classroom is within Schoology,” said Jeremy Friedman, CEO of Schoology. The enhanced Google Integration will be available to preview at the Schoology NEXT user conference in July, and will be available to all users for the beginning of the 2017-2018 school year.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars APPS Hands-on with YouTube TV: Lots of content to watch now and later Jordan Novet@jordannovet April 5, 2017 11:47 AM Tags: Alphabet, Google, YouTube, YouTube TV Above: YouTube TV for iOS. Image Credit: Jordan Novet / VentureBeat Today Google officially launched YouTube TV, a premium cable bundle with companion Android and iOS apps. Google first announced YouTube TV back in January. Now people can take it for a one-month free trial before the $35 ($39.99 on iOS) monthly subscription price kicks in. Out of the box, the app lets you stream shows on ABC, Bravo, CBS, Comcast SportsNet, Disney Channel, ESPN, Fox, Fox News, Fox Sports Networks, Fx, MSNBC, NBC, and USA. You’ll be able to watch YouTube Red Originals as well. In the future Google will add AMC, BBC America, BBC World News, IFC, SundanceTV, Telemundo, and WE tv, YouTube TV head engineer Andrew Jeon wrote in a blog post. I happen to live in San Francisco, one of YouTube TV’s five launch markets, and I’ve been able to try out the new app. And I like it. It’s an easy way in to what normally is kept behind cable companies’ paywalls. It feels great on mobile, and it has no trouble pushing up content to bigger screens with the help of Google Cast. From the app’s Live tab, if you want to channel-surf, you can, in a way. When you flip over to a channel and whatever show is currently airing, you can peek in after a few seconds of hovering over it. For better or worse, the app doesn’t play audio of a show that’s being previewed. Once you’ve dropped into a channel and started streaming, you can tap on the channel’s icon and see the shows coming up, organized into various categories for more intuitive browsing, and you can “add” shows whose episodes will automatically be recorded for you to watch later. For each show you can check out episodes, a summary, the cast, and related and similar shows. The app’s Home tab surfaces individual live and ongoing shows, episodes that you can resume watching, movies, sports teams to follow, and even videos from YouTube. The Library tab collects your scheduled recordings, most watched shows, and shows, movies, and other videos that you’ve added, so it’s easy to find what you want and start watching. Naturally there is a search function that you can get to from all three tabs. This is the latest app Google is releasing under the iconic YouTube name, following YouTube Gaming, YouTube Kids, YouTube Music, and YouTube VR. But YouTube TV is different because the new app primarily gives you content that isn’t available from the classic YouTube. And so far, it does look appealing when you consider how easy it is to get to some of cable’s basics. Apple has been looking for years to provide cable services to consumers. The recently released TV app is a start, but it has hurdles — you have to connect “participating apps” from individual channels to see what you can watch now, and you can buy individual shows and movies from iTunes and other services, like Netflix. With YouTube TV, it’s much more of a no-brainer — it’s all there. ABOUT CONTACT CAREERS ADVERTISE Terms of Service Privacy Policy © 2017 VentureBeat. All rights reserved.

By Blair Hanley Frank U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | Apr 5, 2017 10:51 AM PT Credit: Google More like this Review: The best frameworks for machine learning and deep learning Windows Server on ARM laptops is for Azure only A.I. tools came out of the lab in 2016 Video Choosing technologies to drive digital transformation Four years ago, Google was faced with a conundrum: if all its users hit its voice recognition services for three minutes a day, the company would need to double the number of data centers just to handle all of the requests to the machine learning system powering those services. Rather than buy a bunch of new real estate and servers just for that purpose, the company embarked on a journey to create dedicated hardware for running machine-learning applications like voice recognition. The result was the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), a chip that is designed to accelerate the inference stage of deep neural networks. Google published a paper on Wednesday laying out the performance gains the company saw over comparable CPUs and GPUs, both in terms of raw power and the performance per watt of power consumed. A TPU was on average 15 to 30 times faster at the machine learning inference tasks tested than a comparable server-class Intel Haswell CPU or Nvidia K80 GPU, Google said. Importantly, the performance per watt of the TPU was 25 to 80 times better than what Google found with the CPU and GPU. [ Further reading: Google launches service to make machine learning easier ] Driving this sort of performance increase is important for Google, considering the company’s emphasis on building machine learning applications. The gains validate the company’s focus on building machine learning hardware at a time when it’s harder to get massive performance boosts from traditional silicon. This is more than just an academic exercise. Google has used TPUs in its data centers since 2015 and they’ve been put to use improving the performance of applications including translation and image recognition. The TPUs are particularly useful when it comes to energy efficiency, which is an important metric related to the cost of using hardware at massive scale. One of the other key metrics for Google’s purposes is latency, which is where the TPUs excel compared to other silicon options. Norm Jouppi, a distinguished hardware engineer at Google, said that machine learning systems need to respond quickly in order to provide a good user experience. “The point is, the internet takes time, so if you’re using an internet-based server, it takes time to get from your device to the cloud, it takes time to get back,” Jouppi said. “Networking and various things in the cloud -- in the data center -- they takes some time. So that doesn’t leave a lot of [time] if you want near-instantaneous responses.” Google tested the chips on six different neural network inference applications, representing 95 percent of all such applications in Google’s data centers. The applications tested include DeepMind AlphaGo, the system that defeated Lee Sedol at Go in a five-game match last year. The company tested the TPUs against hardware that was released around roughly the same time to try and get an apples-to-apples performance comparison. It's possible that newer hardware would at least narrow the performance gap. There’s still room for TPUs to improve, too. Using the GDDR5 memory that’s present in an Nvidia K80 GPU with the TPU should provide a performance improvement over the existing configuration that Google tested. According to the company’s research, the performance of several applications was constrained by memory bandwidth. Furthermore, the authors of Google’s paper claim that there’s room for additional software optimization to increase performance. The authors called out one of the tested convolutional neural network applications (referred to in the paper as CNN1) as a candidate. However, because of existing performance gains from the use of TPUs, it’s not clear if those optimizations will take place. While neural networks mimic the way neurons transmit information in humans, CNNs are modeled specifically on how the brain processes visual information. “As CNN1 currently runs more than 70 times faster on the TPU than the CPU, the CNN1 developers are already very happy, so it’s not clear whether or when such optimizations would be performed,” the authors wrote. TPUs are what’s known in chip lingo as an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). They’re custom silicon built for one task, with an instruction set hard-coded into the chip itself. Jouppi said that he wasn’t overly concerned by that, and pointed out that the TPUs are flexible enough to handle changes in machine learning models. “It’s not like it was designed for one model, and if someone comes up with a new model, we’d have to junk our chips or anything like that,” he said. Google isn’t the only company focused on using dedicated hardware for machine learning. Jouppi said that he knows of several startups working in the space, and Microsoft has deployed a fleet of field-programmable gate arrays in its data centers to accelerate networking and machine learning applications.

X German software company sues Google Ireland in the High Court TeamDrive Systems claims product called ‘Team Drives’ infringes its trademark about 12 hours ago Aodhan O'Faolain Google said it wanted an adjournment of the case for several weeks to provide responses to issues raised by the German company         A German software company has sued internet giant Google in the High Court over an alleged copyright infringement. TeamDrive Systems GMBH, which makes secure cloud-based file-sharing and syncing collaboration software for businesses and personal use, has brought its case against Google Ireland Ltd and Google Commerce Ltd. It claims Google’s use of a software product called “Team Drives” infringes the Germany firm’s trademark. The claims are denied. The case was briefly mentioned before Mr Justice Paul Gilligan on Wednesday, and he adjourned it to next month to allow the sides exchange legal documents for a hearing of TeamDrives’s application for injunctions preventing the alleged copyright breach pending the full hearing of the dispute. Google, represented by Paul Gallagher SC, said it wanted an adjournment of several weeks to provide responses to issues raised by the German company. TeamDrive also lodged proceedings against Google before the German courts some months ago, and there may be an issue in relation to jurisdiction, counsel added. Urgent Denis McDonald SC, instructed by TMR Fitzsimons solicitors for TeamDrive, said it was surprised by the request for a lengthy adjournment. The matter was “urgent”, “very serious” and had “enormous consequences” for his client. In its action TeamDrive says since it was established more than a decade ago it has been offering a range of products all under the TeamDrive name and they are registered under an EU trademark. Its software has won awards for providing privacy for consumers, privacy in the workplace and for personal data stored off premises. It is claimed last year Google decided to rebrand some of its products and that included rebranding its Google Drive product to grow its share in the secure enterprise file sync and share market where TeamDrive has operated for many years. Mr McDonald said the use by Google of the term “Team Drives” or “Team Drive” for identical services offered by his client was something of grave concern. Promotional material The terms had been used in promotional material and literature. At a conference in San Francisco this year, Google had a major event surrounding “Team Drives”. Google’s lawyers had said in correspondence the use of the term would not be used in a trademark sense, and it was merely to describe a feature of its Google Drive product. TeamDrive does not accept this, and fears the actions and alleged ongoing breach of its copyright by a company of Google’s economic size may result in untold damage to the value of the German company’s business.       Topics: Courts Justice Paul Gilligan Mr Mcdonald Eu High Court Google Teamdrive Systems  Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Financial Services US financial giant Citadel Securities opens Dublin operation Technology Internet future is gloomy and troll-filled, survey predicts Golf Dustin Johnson’s Masters in doubt after a ‘serious fall’ at home Innovation Could iDly Systems consign plastic ID cards to history?

An Israeli security researcher takes a good look at Samsung's Tizen, labels it the worst code he has ever seen Jordan Palmer Follow View All Posts 2017/04/04 11:26am PDTApr 4, 2017 64 Plus 1 on G+ 276 Share on Facebook 74 Share on Twitter Total Shares414 News Samsung Android is a hulking beast as far as global user share is concerned — hell, it's the most-used operating system in the world, surpassing even Windows (in terms of internet usage). When Samsung announced that it was creating its own open-source alternative to Google's mobile OS, it was not really a surprise. We've had several upstarts over the years, like Sailfish, Firefox OS, Ubuntu Touch, and so on, but all of them have failed in some form or another. There were a few people, however, who thought Sammy could be the one to unseat Google and Android with a mobile operating system that it called Tizen. Whether it's pronounced TEE-zen or TIE-zen is still a mystery (Wikipedia and I say it's the latter), but up until now, word on the integrity and security of the code has been relatively scant. Israeli researcher Amihai Neiderman finally dove into Tizen's guts to see what he could find. According to his report to Motherboard, what he found wasn't good. Niederman claims that the operating system contains what "may be the worst code [he's] ever seen" with signs of amateur mistakes/practices and no less than 40 zero-day vulnerabilities. All of those 40 allow for remote-code execution, which permits nefarious parties to access and assume varying levels of control of a Tizen device. Remember, there are quite a few devices running Samsung's OS, including the Gear smartwatches and some phones. One of the most critical vulnerabilities was in the Tizen Store (the equivalent of the Play Store or App Store), which allowed Niederman to inject malicious code into his Samsung TV (also running Tizen). His conclusion from this was that you as a hypothetical third-party could "update a Tizen system with any malicious code you want." Even the store's authentication measures weren't enough — he just used a heap-overflow vulnerability (which he also discovered) to hijack the software before the security protocols activated. Moving on, Niederman says that Tizen's code base is quite outdated and even borrows some elements from Bada, its predecessor. However, he claims that most of the issues he found were in the new code, which was written in the last two years or so. Some of the mistakes are those one might find programmers making twenty years ago. As Motherboard puts it, this shows that Sammy lacks any basic code development or review practices. To prove his point, Niederman points to one example that he claims was everywhere in Tizen, strcpy(). Basically, strcpy() is a flawed function that is easily exploitable and is not used anymore because of that, yet it is supposedly prevalent in Tizen. To top everything off, Niederman says that the programmers failed to use SSL encryption in certain areas during specific data transmissions. This led him to conclude that they made the wrong assumptions on what needed to be encrypted and purposefully left out SSL in those places. When he initially reached out to Samsung to declare his findings, he was greeted with an automated response. Motherboard's attempts to contact the Korean conglomerate resulted only in the basic PR drivel about the company's focus on security and whatnot. However, after the original article got published, Sammy reached out again to Motherboard to claim that it was working with Niederman to resolve the issues, who corroborated this by saying he was in talks with the corporation. You can read more at the source link below if you're interested. Honestly, I can't say that I'm too surprised. As Mr. Niederman puts it, Samsung should reconsider deploying Tizen to its appliances and future phones before doing a serious overhaul on the code. I find that I agree with him.

(Sarcasm) JohnyNoLegs Lazy coding by coders....SHOCKER!!!! (Sarcasm because even google/apple has shitty code haha) F4LL0U7 But by all means, let's spend $900 on the new Galaxy phone, because I'm sure it's both immune to their terrible code, and totally worth the price tag. Ome Dries The S8 doesn't use Tizen though, so your phone should be safe... your Samsung powered fridge is a different story Leonardo Baez Or their line of smartwatch John Doe Yeah but they probably use the same programmers for Tizen and Android. kalehv I wouldn't think so. Tizen and Android are very very different inside out. demarcmj Probably not the same programmers, but the culture, processes, etc. are probably the same. Just this. the general attitude can't (and won't) be different MJ No... The Android and Tizen programmers are most certainly on different teams and only deal with their platform. This does not mean Samsung as a whole is good at software. John Doe We don't know if they really are on different teams unless Samsung told you. MJ I wouldn't know if Samsung employs cows for programmers unless they told me but I can almost guarantee the teams are separate. Programming teams at any company tend to specialize on ONE project at a time. It's not the same guys... There will be a small number of top programmers who will move from team to to team to fix problems or help with deadlines. John Doe "I can almost guarantee the teams are separate" No you can't unless you are an employee there and know what Samsung is doing. Samsung is not your typical silicon valley tech company so I have no idea how they work. MJ It's funny your whole argument is there is no way we can know how they do it at Samsung yet you had no problem making the statement the Android and Tizen programmers are probably the same which would be a totally unusual setup for any company with large programmer teams. Why not just go with they are probably cows which is why their software is so bad. LOL John Doe They probably are cows :) F4LL0U7 Right, but my point is that their code is crap, and they're making tons of "enhancements" to the Android OS, plus the dozens of Google apps they unnecessarily duplicate. Their terrible code makes a huge impact on the Android ecosystem. tim242 They don't unnecessarily duplicate anything. Samsung has many apps that are far superior to Google's bloatware. John Doe https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e46717cc007988df31954f458f30b8b237b2c4e803101752d08debfaa155bcf3.gif tim242 Samsung Pay>Android Pay Samsung Browser>Chrome John Doe Samsung pay is greater how exactly? And no on the browser I used Samsung's browser it is not as good as chrome. tim242 Ummm I can use Samsung Pay everywhere. As for the browser, you are full of shit. John Doe Umm that is hardware not software, Samsung bought looppay to do that and it has nothing to do with Samsung's software. Chrome is the most used browser in the world...facts. tim242 It is hardware and software, you know like Android Pay uses NFC. You aren't very smart. As for the browser, since when does most used equal best? McDonald's burgers are the most popular burgers, but nobody will claim them to be the best. Do better. John Doe Wow lmao. Looppay uses MST like your credit card so very little software is needed for it to work. You just need to store credit card information. with NFC there is more communications on both ends and more authentication is required. It is more secure than Magnetic strips. But at the end of the day when it comes to software Apple pay and Android Pay are much better (Design, speed, ease of use, etc) I have used Samsung's browser it is featureless. Chrome has a lot of features that I use and it is fast. I save my passwords in chrome, I have data saver, Read later, cached pages for quick reload, Google AMP, autofill is synced, better privacy controls and Do Not Track, Google translate embedded, and fine grain controls for sites accessing camera, microphone, notifications, etc. Samsung's browser is small potatoes compared to Chrome. AbbyZFresh If you've used Samsung's browser, then you would know it's speed >>>>> Chrome is well worth less features in the way John Doe Bitch please you are a bigger troll than Tim and you are a Google hater. Why are you even here? tim242 Your ignorance/stupidity is really showing. MST uses tokenization just the same as NFC. You should educate yourself before commenting about something you know nothing about. Samsung Pay is superior, deal with it. Samsung's browser is lighter, and has more features. You can log into sites with your fingerprint. Try that in Chrome. You can also use an ad blocker plugin. Try that in Chrome. Oh, and it is Chromium based. That means it has a lot of Chrome features as well. Do better John Doe What does tokenization have to do with using the app? We are comparing Samsung Pay with Android pay here and you said samsung pay is better because you can use it anywhere that has nothing to do with samsung pay dumbass that is looppay which samsung bought. It has nothing to do with the actual software. When it comes to the actual app the design, speed and ease of use of Android and Apple pay is better than samsung pay. Chrome still has a lot more features that the two you mentioned. But I can't change the mind of an ignorant troll. A troll is a troll is a troll. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/70cffa9c6cf517883f23a7ea527e30ffa7ecb7b3f6c82e8599d47b0b1cca584e.gif tim242 LoopPay does not exist. Samsung bought it and incorporated it into Samsung Pay, which makes it better than Android Pay. Tokenization means it is not insecure, as you claimed. You are the obvious troll. You make no sense at all. John Doe Looppay is a hardware feature it has very little to do with the app that is like saying I can use 3.5mm headphones with my music app compared to the iPhone. It is a hardware feature but the app at the end of the day is judged separate from that. You are truly fucken moron and deserve a note 7. tim242 LoopPay was the name of a company that no longer exists. MST was bought by Samsung and is part of Samsung Pay. Hardware can't work without software. Why you are trying to separate the two, is beyond me. Take the tech that Google bought from SoftCard/ISIS out of Android Pay, and see how far that NFC chip gets you. You are now on block, as your stupidity is too much for me. John Doe Samsung bought looppay and its patents so you can't have MST on other devices. We are comparing Samsung with Google here so you have to compare only the software not the harware (This whole fucken article is about software and samsung's incompetence). You are fucken retarted Softcard/ISIS was bought for Google wallet not Android pay and it was because carriers blocked Google wallet so Google bought softcard which was made by the carriers. Samsung pay sucks, period. "Samsung Pay's security measures are based on Samsung Knox and ARM TrustZone technologies; credit card information is stored in a secure token.[3] Payments must be authenticated using a fingerprint scan.[6][7] In August 2016, security researcher Salvador Mendoza disclosed a potential flaw with Samsung Pay, arguing that its security tokens were not sufficiently randomized and could become predictable. He also designed a handheld device that could be used to skim magnetic secure transmission tokens, and another which could spoof magnetic stripes on actual card readers using the token. Samsung responded to the report, stating that "If at any time there is a potential vulnerability, we will act promptly to investigate and resolve the issue".[8]" http://www.zdnet.com/article/flaw-in-samsung-pay-lets-hackers-wirelessly-skim-credit-cards/ Middlefinger Just because people are forced to use chrome on Android it doesnt mean its the best. Its the new IE, its terrible on mobile and hardly better on desktop. MJ Who are these people who are forced to use Chrome on Android? John Doe They are not forced to use it. Chrome doesn't come preloaded on desktop but it is still the number one because people go and download it. And it doesn't come preloaded on all Android phones. Middlefinger Yes, it is on every Android phone. If people chose Chrome over Firefox then thats their own problem and its not like FF is perfect either. John Doe It is not on every Android phone. And they choose it because they like it and want to use it. Middlefinger Its compulsory according to the Android licensing agreement, if you want Google play access. John Doe The play store is not on every Android phone...its not on any phone in china for example and the Mobile Application Distribution Agreement is optional and Google chrome is not even set to default and is hidden in a folder on Samsung devices so no one is forcing anyone to do anything here. Middlefinger Its on every phone that has access to the play store. What china does is not relevant to this so dont deflect. You know full well what i was referring to, not that it will stop you claiming victory as is usual on here. Its not hidden, its right on the damn home screen on international unlocked OEM devices. John Doe You said "*EVERY* android phone has Google Chrome". There are plenty of Android phones that do not sign that agreement and do not have the play store on them also the agreement is negotiated with Google including what apps to include. This agreement is also signed with carriers so Google, OEMs and the carriers negotiate it. And yes it is hidden in the US carrier version because I had to go through the app list, open the folder, click on it to use it and also have to make it default...it is not set to default. This was on an S7 edge. https://landing.google.com/intl/en/androidisforusers/faq.html https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-4a46Ko8RE Middlefinger Newsflash, the world doesnt revolve around US carriers.. On the first point.. well done, you won on a technicality that neither of us were even talking about anyway. John Doe That is where OEMs sell the majority of their phones through carriers and specifically US carriers not international unlocked phones which samsung doesn't even update on time (But that is another issue). But even in the international unlocked phone I am sure the S7 also does not have chrome as the default browser. Middlefinger My Samsung devices do, as did my LGs, HTCs and so on (including network branded ones). Some US carriers may have other things installed and set to default, but its the exception in the world. Either way Google requires its bloat be installed, and i dont see that as any better than Samsungs. John Doe You may think is bloat but the billions of Google users out there do not think so go download what you like. Shame-sung C.E.O Swinesung Pay is Garbage. Don't fall for this guys Sheep Mentallity. This is the same person who said CURRENT-C was going to be the winner out of Payment wars LOL!! No joke he was the biggest shill for Months. Shame-sung C.E.O https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d20aef0fbc504aadabb8bd8fde48166d56c8b76806fd4b9f3e699fb0f3c88c9a.jpg https://media.giphy.com/media/l3E6uhDAN3W7vylji/giphy.gif LMFAO!!! LineOS for exynos! I know Samsung browser is based on chromium... But he say 'better' becouse ad blocker... If chrome have ad blocker is will be faster.. that for sure Suicide_Note Two hardly qualifies as 'many apps'. tim242 That was just two examples. Another example is Messages. I have to use Samsung Messages, because Google forces pop up messages, unless you silence them altogether. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages all the time, but I'm not aware of any pop-up messages. Or are you referring to the way the message notification pops up? tim242 Yes, the notifications. Google took the option out of the settings to disable that nonsense. Samsung put the option into their app. Why is Google forcing that on us? It is annoying to have them interrupt what I am doing, and disregards privacy Suicide_Note I like it since i can see if i need to reply immediately or not, or just dismiss it to the notification tray, but to each their own. Good thing we have so many options to choose from. 😊 tim242 Yeah, I would use Google Messenger, if only I could disable that. Knowing Google, they may add that back later. JohnyNoLegs Google doesn't even have an audio recording app LOL. Google has barely anything. Literally BARE Middlefinger amung browser is superior to chrome. A carrier Pigeon is better than chrome, at least Samsung internet actually exits properly when you press the back button. John Doe So go use a carrier pigeon...troll LoL If you like Samsung and their programming skills go buy a Tizen phone Middlefinger I prefer Samsung to Google anyway. Android is a damn mess and getting worse again. Sure 7 is better than the total disaster that was kitkat, but its worse than anything since KK. John Doe Ok so go get a Tizen phone http://www.samsung.com/in/smartphones/samsung-z3/ Middlefinger I prefer Samsungs mods to Android to Googles 'stock', Samsung actually seem to test it before breaking everyone devices. John Doe That is because everyone's device is already broken (Laggy, buggy, slow, and filled with unnecessary apps). Middlefinger Like most of the Google apps, yeah you're right. John Doe Google's apps are updated continually and are stable than the majority of OEM apps since they are mostly updated by OTA instead of through the play store like all of Google's apps. Anyways, that doesn't change the fact that Samsung's software is laggy and terrible...it also gets worse over time which is just sad. And the fact that they take forever to update their phones does not help your argument. Middlefinger Firstly thats horseshit, Google apps are just as unstable as any. Secondly Samsungs launcher can be laggy, jsut like Googles can be painfully limited, so dont use either. The rest of the Samsung mods are better than Googles, especially the notification pulldown. Ive already addressed the update thing. If Google was pushing 7.1.1 to every device in the world there would be hundreds of millions that randomly rebooted. The OEMs test better and it takes time. Older thats stable and fixed is better than newer and broken. John Doe Firstly thats horseshit, Google apps are just as unstable as any. I use Google's apps daily and they are not unstable actually they are highly rated in the play store compared to samsung's apps and are used by way more people that just shows how stable they are. Unless you are using beta version, heck even the beta version is stable so I have no idea what you are talking about. There are always problems with updates even Apple has them with iOS but the difference is Google can push out a fix quickly like Apple. Also with new updates you get security patches and fixes for older bugs that take months to fix when going through OEMs and carriers. If you think Samsung's programming is good go check the article you are commenting on LoL. Middlefinger So what if google can and does patch things quickly, it shouldn't get broken in the first place. This just doesn't happen with most OEM devices, and hasnt to a single one ive ever had. My Nexus devices have been a string of bad hardware, poor software, show stopping faults and RMAs. John Doe I have had several nexus devices and pixel and I have never had severe problems to a point where I had to send it in. There are bugs like any other OEM especially samsung but Google has the ability to fix them quickly. Newflash, it does happen with a lot of OEMs including Apple. This isn't new anyways Google's software is highly praised on the pixel compared to Samsung's "horseshit". Go check the reviews. Middlefinger Im sure the 9 people that have a Pixel just loved the reboots. Nice its fixed, shame it ever happened. Never had severe problem eh? Ive never had ANY with anything except the Nexus'. Highly praised is it? By who exactly? If its the same people that bought the Nexus then they are easily pleased and highly biased. You cant deny there is an entire body of fanboys out there that love AOSP, regardless of how bad it is. If google just secretly used all Samsungs code for 8 it would be the best thing ever, because bias blinds. John Doe 9 people? classy. Nice joke. Never had severe problem eh? Ive never had ANY with anything except the Nexus'. You just lost all credibility just stop. All the tech blogs gave it excellent reviews and said it was the best Android phone available even tech blogs that favor Apple said so and that says a lot. Middlefinger Yeah, OK. Zero Mizukami What didnt you like about kitkat? I was always under the impression kitkat was more or less the pinnacle of Android Audio Totally disagree. There are no Samsung apps on my S7 that I actually use. tim242 That's you. I use Samsung Pay every day, to pay for everything. Samsung's browser is far superior to Chrome. I use Samsung's SMS app, because Google forces pop up messages on theirs. F4LL0U7 That's your opinion, and of course I have my own. It was just a little frustrating when I started my work GS7 for the first time and saw two of nearly every app. As a Nexus/Pixel guy, I'm horrified at Samsung's terrible (in my opinion) design and functionality standards. Not to mention the 3rd party garbage they toss in there too. I had to purchase an app that allows me to disable their default apps. When your first task in the process of setting up a new phone is to wade through and remove the bloat, there's something wrong there. tim242 I purchased a package disabler as well. But I also had to disable a lot of Google bloatware as well. John Doe You need to look up the term bloatware. Lookup, Microsoft office, facebook, and all the other unnecessary apps that don't need to be preinstalled are bloatware. Anyways I don't know what I am arguing with you samsung phones are burning up...literally so unless samsung sells 100+ million s8 they will always be behind apple. tim242 Behind apple haha you are silly. John Doe Why is that silly? They are behind Apple in the smartphone business. tim242 That is not true. Get educated, then comment. John Doe Lmao http://www.techtimes.com/articles/188124/20161208/apple-iphone-7-is-the-best-selling-smartphone-in-us-trumping-the-samsung-galaxy-s7-kantar.htm https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/56f89a4335e2c7fe807cdebf208e142c62b61a5cec127b30c1f4b3c96aee3961.gif tim242 Lmao that is just the S7. Samsung has many other smartphones. You are trying to move the goalposts. Try harder John Doe http://bgr.com/2017/02/03/apple-vs-samsung-sales-2016/ http://www.businessinsider.com/samsung-galaxy-apple-iphone-premium-market-share-chart-2016-12 https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/10/16/samsung-galaxy-vs-iphone-which-product-line-has-so.aspx Apple beat Samsung with 3 Phones....Samsung had 31. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/13806899d2dd953b00745e25586ce63bc99bfb72ae0d42ccd3bbb42fa9c618b5.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78dd8b407e1ea19bc331dea202aae34c0cb0772bea409ff56a11d2efb86e7f9d.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/91444a76a0ec89e25770a31b864244d9c04aad4f64e7c6152e993058b5c82bb9.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/688053d5bd7c128160ba9a9dfe79639b542955188e91c63913e08ee14faa1f85.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e9eb24fa3eae7253df33b2eb97d2250c7c498213eec6de868a759657891aad6b.png JohnyNoLegs Yea like Pixel Launcher, Hangouts, Daydream haha byteseyes Google apps are definitely bloatware. There's tons of Google bloatware I delete every time I get a new device with Android on it. Granted, I think Samsung and Google should get a pass for including their software because it's Samsung's hardware and part Samsung and part Google's software. Completely 3rd party companies like carriers or Microsoft stuffing their software is the worst kind of bloatware. John Doe Google apps are not bloatware because people do use them and they are useful. Bloatware means apps that people don't use and waste space on your device. Google's apps definitly do not waste space and the majority of them are used so no they are not bloatware. These are the apps Google requires most are Google play apps: Google Chrome Google Maps Google Drive YouTube Gmail Google+ (The only one I think is unnecessary) Google Play Music Google Play Movies Google Play Books Google Play Newsstand Google Play Games Google Photos Hangouts (Probably stopped requiring it already) byteseyes Your conclusion that Google apps are not bloatware rests on the premise that people use them. By the same token, Samsung apps are not bloatware because people do use them and they are useful. Realistically, I can count on 2 hands the number of people I've come across who use Google Play Music, Movies, Books, Newsstand, Games, Photos, Hangouts, and Google+. Most people I know do use YouTube and Maps the most, while Chrome is forced onto people often. Drive is a wash. That means almost all of Google's apps are not commonly used, hence waste space. So don't you think it's unfair and untrue to make the assumption that people use Google apps, while simultaneously making the unfair and untrue assumption that people don't use Samsung apps? I personally love Samsung apps and I find most of Google's apps redundant. I can understand if people are vice versa. Haha, sorry, I didn't mean this response to be too long, so all boiled down, Samsung and Google apps are either both bloatware or both not. Hope you can understand that they can not be different. John Doe Fact is that far more people use Google's apps than Samsung's you can check the play store reviews and how many people use them. Google's services are used way more often than Samsung's that is a known fact. Google and Samsung do not release numbers of every single app but Google has a billion+ monthly active users on some of their services. When it comes to the Google play apps, they come in a package with the play store. It makes no fucken sense to have a music section in the play store and no app to play it with. They are a package. Chrome is not "forced" on people. You need to lookup what that word means and Chrome is not even set as default on samsung devices so how the hell is it "forced"? That means almost all of Google's apps are not commonly used, hence waste space. It is silly to make a statement like that So don't you think it's unfair and untrue to make the assumption that people use Google apps, while simultaneously making the unfair and untrue assumption that people don't use Samsung apps? No because like stated above Google has more than billion+ active users on their services and highly rated apps in the play store and they a regularly updated. Samsung on the other hand has even discontinued multiple apps and services because no one is using them like Samsung milk music. https://play.google.com/store/apps/collection/search_results_cluster_apps?clp=ggEJCgdzYW1zdW5n:S:ANO1ljLMiXA https://play.google.com/store/apps/collection/search_results_cluster_apps?clp=ggEICgZnb29nbGU%3D:S:ANO1ljIY5oM Bloatware apps are determined by the user and I am positive that more users find Google's apps in a favorable light than Samsung's. You are in the minority. byteseyes "Fact is that far more people use Google's apps than Samsung's you can check the play store reviews and how many people use them. Google's services are used way more often than Samsung's that is a known fact. Google and Samsung do not release numbers of every single app but Google has a billion+ monthly active users on some of their services." YouTube and Maps are the most popular. The majority of Google apps are not used at all by most people. But that doesn't matter. The point is lots of people use Google apps, and lots of people use Samsung apps too. You can't ignore one group of people even if it's one order of magnitude smaller. It's still a significant number. "When it comes to the Google play apps, they come in a package with the play store. It makes no fucken sense to have a music section in the play store and no app to play it with. They are a package." Many people don't use them. I'm just using your own assumption and logic. I personally deleted them. Whether it makes sense or not to include them is irrelevant. Of course from a company's perspective it almost always makes sense to include their own service. That's business. You're inclined to make justifications for Google but not for others. "Chrome is not "forced" on people. You need to lookup what that word means and Chrome is not even set as default on samsung devices so how the hell is it "forced"?" It's not forced on Samsung devices thank god. But anyway, instead of on smartphones, I was just remembering off the top of my head about the Chrome browser slipping its way into many people's computers, so I was going off a tangent there. "It is silly to make a statement like that" It's pure logic. "No because like stated above Google has more than billion+ active users on their services and highly rated apps in the play store and they a regularly updated. Samsung on the other hand has even discontinued multiple apps and services because no one is using them like Samsung milk music." Again, that's not the case for almost all of Google's apps. Most of Google's apps are not commonly used. Google also discontinues or leaves as zombies apps that no one uses. "Bloatware apps are determined by the user" That's what I've been saying all along. "and I am positive that more users find Google's apps in a favorable light than Samsung's. You are in the minority." Of course a software-centric company is going to have a larger user base. I may be in the minority, but it's still a large number of people. We're not talking about 1 user vs 1 million. If there's 1 user, and an app is installed to cater to that one 1 user, then it would be bad to include the app. But many, many, many people use Samsung apps too. You can't cherry pick what you like and ignore everything that others like. John Doe Exactly so going back to my original comment that Google's apps are not bloatware and that apps from Facebook, Microsoft, and Lookout are bloatware. Also when Samsung has two music apps like Google play music and Milk on their devices and they end up discontinuing Milk because no one uses it that is also bloatware. So I am glad we cleared up your confusion on whether Google's apps are "definitly bloatware" https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/04d006e4bd2b9525b0b0e9550444617ee69614c33bf605ad372243dc9af02410.png byteseyes Logic must not be your strong suit. John Doe Good Job nice comeback byteseyes Thanks. byteseyes I can understand your viewpoint. Me personally, I find most of Google's apps redundant because I really love Samsung's apps. I actually did the same as you haha! I purchased an app to delete all of Google's apps except Youtube and Maps and a few of Samsung's too. I think there are people who use Samsung apps and people who use Google apps. Not referring to you, but some people like to think Google apps are not bloatware because they themselves use them. But many people also love and use Samsung apps, myself included. Even though I love Samsung apps, I can totally understand if people are vice versa. Logically speaking, either both Samsung and Google apps are both bloatware or both not. dabug91 Lol, umm Samsung has it's own calendar app, calculator app, memo app, messaging app, etc and they're all shit. No phone has more bloatware than a Samsung phone. They win hands-down in that category. tim242 I prefer all of those to Google's offerings. I'm glad to have a choice. OligarchyAmbulance You honestly think they have higher standards for their lagfest Android skin? tim242 They have higher standards than Google/HTC with the dumpster fire that is Pixel. John Doe https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a1405ef722a16da1e676294296d43a0d524eaaf5c53be0f4ec6d89b9ab035eb1.gif M. Luciano What? Where are you getting all this? tim242 There have been numerous hardware issues reported since release. Some of which being the microphone, speakers, camera, and the display. tekfr33kn I've had my Pixel for a few months now and haven't had a single one of those problems. I know that a few people have had them but it's more rare than you you are making it out to be. Audio Or for Knox for that matter! Bob http://imgur.com/gallery/UrhOtai Middlefinger No it uses Android, which we all know is perfect/ s ... At least Samsung fixes the mess Google creates most of time though. Jumanji! Are you perhaps conflating user experience with quality/security of code? A company can make something look pretty or function, but that doesn't mean there aren't any issues with the security of their code. Computer science isn't an exact science and creating software is always a series of trade offs. Middlefinger No im basing it on all the problem Google has with its own devices and how much time OEMs have to spend fixing Google code before they release it on their own devices. Jumanji! What do you expect? Android is a big, complex platform and there are a number of OEMs who blend it with their own, unique hardware variations and services. It's absolutely normal for customers to find defects in shipping products. It's ultimately how the company reacts to customer facing defects and issues that really matters. I'd love to see a list of the volume of defects that OEMs have fixed in the Android platform. I think data has the potential of strengthening your arguments rather than having them appear to be nothing but hyperbole. Middlefinger Not all fixes they make is committed back to stock. Much of what the OEMs do is proprietary, but given that OEM devices dont have the problems AOSP based devices do its reasonable to say they fixed something. If all the Google devices had identical hardware you could argue the problem is which specific hardware, but thats not the case. Regardless of the hardware the problem persists because the problems are in Googles code. Zsolt V You are right in everything you wrote. Congrats, finally a sane voice. F4LL0U7 If that was sincere and not sarcastic, thanks! JohnyNoLegs Haha doesn't run Tizen. Fail. Google code their own bugs anyway. F4LL0U7 No shit, try reading the rest of the thread.

I don't recall my Nexus 7 which have had for three years ever randomly rebooting. I used a Nexus 5 actively for 2 1/2 years and remember a short period where I had to MANUALLY reboot it a couple of times a week. My Pixel XL has been stable and just as fast/smooth since day one. JohnyNoLegs Pixel XL here, required one RMA, 3 factory resets. Bluetooth is still dodgy. Google Play music is dodgy, it doesn't play for more than 30 mins without stopping audio. LOL at you thinking Google/Nexus?Pixel is any better LOLOLOLOLOL MJ OK, you had a bad phone. So? I have owned more than three Nexus/Pixel devices with no major issues. Regardless, I was responding specifically to the random rebooting issue the OP mentioned that I have never seen. JohnyNoLegs Nexus 5X random reboots. My wife RMA'd it within the first 6 months. 6P battery would die when it got to 30%, RMA'd that and the 6P i got, android system used loads of battery and I would barely get 1.5 hrs SOT even after factory resets. Then bought Note7, was leaps and bounds ahead of the Nexus 5X and 6P, except for the whole risk of exploding....THen I got the Pixel, which yea sure it's always fast at first, but it does so much less than the Note 7, and now my Pixel struggles at points anyway. I have owned every nexus except for the 6, I have also owned nearly all LG G series and Galaxy series. The most Issues I have had are with nexus devices, mostly to do with updates. Airoid Sammy is fu#ked Suicide_Note Hardly.

Google likes to whip things up quick and throw spaghetti on the wall to see what sticks. There's lots of mistakes in that process. Also, Samsung specifically stated face unlock is not intended to be a secure locking method. They specifically said it's analogous to slide to unlock, so I don't understand why people are misunderstanding this as a "security flaw" when it's not. Justin That's why Google removed Face Unlock in Lollipop. Abhilash Bingi What? No. It just got renamed to 'Trusted face' and moved to Smart Lock along with 'Trusted places' location and 'Trusted Devices'. It's still an option on my Pixel. OligarchyAmbulance Same here. If this is how they treat their own OS, I have no hope for their version of Android. You're lucky if you even get a security patch from them. byteseyes Samsung's the only company out of all manufacturers that releases monthly security patches actually. Pretty awesome. OligarchyAmbulance No, Google does too. byteseyes I mentioned out of all manufacturers. Google's not a manufacturer. That's why I was pointing out that it makes Samsung special. OligarchyAmbulance The Pixel, Pixel C, Chromebook Pixel, Home, Chromecast, Chromecast Audio, Google WiFi, and Daydream would disagree with you. byteseyes Um, I thought it was quite obvious we're talking about phones, given that we're discussing Android and monthly security patches on smartphones. What does a laptop or a router have anything to do with smartphones? Besides, the Pixel phone was not manufactured by Google. Regardless, this doesn't change my original statement that Samsung is the only manufacturer that releases monthly security patches (for their smartphones, in case I wasn't explicit enough), and nobody considers Google a manufacturer, even with Google's nascent foray into the fringe hardware products you listed. In time, Google may become a manufacturer too. Who knows. OligarchyAmbulance "Google's not a manufacturer." "Um, I thought it was quite obvious we're talking about phones" Google is a manufacturer of many devices. That was the point. "Besides, the Pixel phone was not manufactured by Google" Right, and iPhones are made by Foxconn. So technically speaking, Apple has never updated an Apple device. byteseyes Um, you do realize you're arguing about absolutely nothing right now? I never denied Google updates their phone. I already knew Google updates their phone. I was stating that Samsung, a phone manufacturer, is the only OEM that releases monthly security patches, a direct contradiction to your initial statement "You're lucky if you even get a security patch from them." OligarchyAmbulance "Samsung, a phone manufacturer, is the only OEM that releases monthly security patches" They're the only OEM if you don't include another OEM. lol byteseyes Google's an OEM? Apple's OEM? That's news to everyone. tim242 Android's face unlock was the same. Besides, Samsung tells you that it is low security. You are just a nasty google sheep. EcE While I don't disagree, it's been 5 or 6 years. If Samsung was going to implement it, at least try harder. My guess is that it was a last minute addition due to the rumored onscreen fingerprint sensor they had to ditch. Shame-sung C.E.O Says the Current-C Shill who is a sheep to Swinesung now. Carson Saldanha Have I ever agreed on anything with you? tim242 I am not sure. But you should more often : ) Carson Saldanha -___________________________________________- Shame-sung C.E.O This has nothing to do with Apple. SWINESUNG is a huge dishonest,Corrupt,Horrible company who will be always known for stealing , profit, sued, settle. Speculation on what Apple is going to do = Nothing. The sad Truth is that Pathetic TIZEN Garbage OS will always be a Rip off iOS,Android & Windows and WebOS . Swinesung does nothing Original and does it half baked like all its product. FAIL FAIL FAIL. Peter World Citizen Your Korean boyfriend left you recently? ;) Shame-sung C.E.O why are you sharing what your mother told you? Kind of random LOL!! Defenestratus Google's software development isn't by any means stellar either. John Doe It is definitly more secure than Samsung and better designed. Google has a project zero team so find security flaws and it works great...I wonder why they haven't looked at Tizen OS lmao Zsolt V It's by not stellar you mean that it's the best out of all commercial companies you are right.... QwertyJuan To be fair... if you lose your phone, there is a HIGH chance that the person finding it has NO idea who you are, doesn't possess any pictures of you, thereby making the facial recognition feature a decent level of security. No... it won't stop your younger brother or one of your friends from "hacking" your phone when you are asleep. :) P.S. Samsung ALSO has a retina scanner built into the phone which is actually MORE secure than even a fingerprint scanner and for some reason we hear NOTHING about this feature. whispy_snippet It's less secure for the very reasons you just outlined. It's easier to get a photo of someone than their fingerprint. Drakenoid Not if you're a common thief, then it's easier to get their fingerprints off the phone than their pic. whispy_snippet I'm sceptical that a common thief has the tools and/or technical know-how to obtain and then exploit someone's finger print. It's not easy. Drakenoid True, but it's then also unlikely for them to get photo of the owner. My name is…. Oh yes, the classic douche that says "that's why i stick with Pixel/Nexus devices" Because Android was never full of holes or the Pixel deserves the iphone-like price tag. Zsolt V It's better than an iPhone, so why shouldn't it be priced so? Justin You know what's worse than GoPro Sheeps? Nexus Sheeps. YaKillaCJ Hold up now, while I agree that Samsung suck in the software department, I disagree with the Chinese OEM part. Let's not forget that Xiaomi has the best update record, even surpassing Google depending how ya look at it. Also OnePlus has been really good and ZTE not bad at all. Zsolt V What does update speed have anything to do with this topic? jodieisme Security patch..? Zsolt V So Samsung doesn't deliver timely monthly patches? mma173 Xiaomi is a way better than Google. MIUI has so many advantages over the other Android roms. But the one has to admit that they took their "inspiration" from Apple :) especially in the early days. Drakenoid True, I wish they would update the basic usability of MIUI to be more in line with Android, specially now that Android does a lot of things better. They don't have to serve Google's Android just an updated version with better design. I love their features though. Though Xiaomi doesn't provide security patches to Mi 5 as fast as they should. Zsolt V So you 3D print a face, no difference. Adam Truelove Agree, Stock Android managed by Google running on an S8 would be wonderful. Samsung makes great hardware, but absolute garbage software. JohnyNoLegs Samsung states it isn't secure man. SAM I had read about Tizen code and management and no wonder this article makes sense. Read what other programmers had to say abt tizen https://what.thedailywtf.com/topic/15687/code-review-malediction https://what.thedailywtf.com/topic/15001/enlightened Suicide_Note I view Tizen as being akin to the dark language of Mordor, and should never be spoken of. marcusmarcus2 What? Now you just made Tizen sound kinda cool. Jordan Palmer Well done. Bewear Die, T(ouchW)izen, die. YouNex That's why #NeverSamsung JohnyNoLegs Yea, go with some other small company that must have great developers and code review policies...LOL Audio This has always been my fear about tizen and why I can't buy the gear s3 watch, ESPECIALLY for using Samsung Pay. It also makes me wonder about Samsung Knox, tbh... Sruly J Isn't part of Knox incorporated into Android for Work? Audio Is it? I always assumed it was separate... Doesn't Knox pre-date Android for Work? Defenestratus Yes it is integrated into Android's Security apparatus and yes, it pre-dated Android for Work (which as far as I can tell is vaporware). saf1927 Android for Work is useful to use it as way to have multiple app profiles. There's an app on the Play Store that create a work profile you can manage yourself by adding apps, etc. LineOS for exynos! Call island Sruly J Don't remember the article, but this article says that part of Knox was incorporated into Android. http://www.zdnet.com/article/google-samsung-integrate-knox-into-android-eye-enterprise-gains/ Shame-sung C.E.O LMFAO!! For years i been saying the same-thing. TIZEN OS is just pure Trash. Swinesung has always had lower standards then free boostmobile phones and Software that should be on V-Tech phones at the least( no insult to V-tech). How ever we all know Swinesung is not Special and has never been special. It's just a Sheep Mentality. Good thing there is Nexus who gives you Amazing Hardware and Software not Bloatware and Half baked products like the ones Swinesung makes. Another Fail from Swinesung. Aaron Uh, you know Nexus isn't a thing anymore, right? Middlefinger Samsung probably spends so much time fixing Googles mess on Android for its devices that there is no time for Tizen.. tekfr33kn You mean f-ing up Android - Fix'd it for ya. Middlefinger How can they f it up when they make it actually work without causing the phone to reboot randomly. Thats an Android fault that affects a number of totally different devices, its not hardware, its Googles software, again. Googles UX is just getting old now, and while yes, Touchwiz was poor in places Grace UX is far superior to whatever the hell Google is doing. Its more logical, provides more information in a better way and is fully themeable. Adam Margeson Having owned the original Android device (HTC Dream), a Nexus 5 and a Pixel on top of several others, Google's devices tend to be the more stable ones in my experience. It's other OEMs like Sony, HTC and others that tend to have problems because of code they precariously stack on top of Android. I'm not saying that Samsung's is better or worse than others', but Stock Android has been fairly stable for me. As to "Google's UX is getting old now",.. As compared to what? Samsung's is really just a highly integrated theme on top of Google's UX. Sure, the settings are moved around, the quick settings look a little different, etc, but what about General "Android" is getting old? JohnyNoLegs My experience is the opposite. Having had RMA'd my Pixel XL twice, and had to Factory Reset a few more times, that's more than all my phone prior. Given the latest Bluetooth bugs and Google Play Music bugs, I think you are just floating on cloud 9 oblivious to reality. I have come from Samsung, LG and HTC. My Nexus 5x is a whole other story, it has been even worse haha Adam Margeson My normal vehicle doesn't have Bluetooth, but the rentals I used for several weeks during the time (2017 KIA Sonata, 2016 Ford F350 and 2016 Ford Taurus) that the bug was active didn't seem to have any issues - in fact, they were overly aggressive in trying to connect even when I didn't want it to. I also don't generally use Google Play Music. So, no, I haven't been on Cloud Nine, I just haven't had the same issues other people have. That said, I was hit by the audio-clipping-at-loud-volumes bug that was there for a couple months. That was mildly (/s) annoying. I only factory reset my Nexus 5 a handful of times over the 3.5 years that I used it, and that was more a matter of having far too many apps and background services running to the point that I just reset it rather than cleaning it up. I have read AP every day since I found the site back when the Galaxy Nexus was released, and I am well aware of the bugs other people have been having. I count myself lucky that I haven't been seen most of those bugs personally. Middlefinger None of it is 'stacked on top of stock'. Its a replacement for it, the stock code isnt there. Almost all OEM android is virtually a fork, and there is no reason why i cannot be better than Googles version. whispy_snippet This is the guy who labels people "Google shills". Middlefinger Who am I shilling for? Samsung because I have their phone, LG because I have their TV, or Microsoft because i have their Tablet? Maybe im just not happy with the state of Android at the moment.. Nah, i must be a paid Samsung troll obviously. whispy_snippet So? What's your point? I have a Surface, an LG TV and a Pixel. But everyone knows phones are the most important piece of tech a person owns which is why they generate such intense discussion. You seem like a huge Samsung "shill" and a massive hypocrite. Middlefinger Everyone knows that do they? Sure if you say so, maybe if you are 14. Funny ive been accused of being a shill for Google as well, so it seems to to depend on the bias of the accuser, namely, you. whispy_snippet You're kidding. So you disagree that the smartphone is the most important and innovative piece of consumer technology this century? Mate, what planet are you living on? Middlefinger I didnt say it wasnt (it was actually invented last century, but whatever). I said its not the most essential to everyone. whispy_snippet I didn't say it was invented this century, but whatever. The statement "everyone knows" was an unbelievably poor choice of words and I can't believe I actually wrote it. But my broader point that smartphones are the most important piece of consumer technology this century still stands. My other point, that you're a hypocrite, also still stands. whispy_snippet Oh yeah. For sure man. You got it. M. Luciano This makes sense. Samsung doesn't know mobile security. They have Knox, which they purchased and then had fixed by BlackBerry. We have notifications constantly about people's dryers and refrigerators being hacked, their TV's being hacked and the only way they get out of it on Android is because someone else is handling 90%+ of the legwork, ie. Google. JohnyNoLegs Knox is better than AOSP. M. Luciano I don't believe that at all, but even if true, the point was they didn't create that. JohnyNoLegs Why would that matter who created it? keithzg Because it speaks to their ability to write good, secure software, which is what's in question here. JohnyNoLegs Well they didn't write it, so then it should be great then by your logic. You are also ASSUMING, that all dev's/dev teams/products are done by the same people, which would be a huge assumption that is probably very wrong. Samsung didn't even code Tizen anyway. M. Luciano Because if they'd have built it, they'd probably understand something about security. But they bought it and then had BlackBerry improve it. JohnyNoLegs So thats a good thing right? ast00 At the end of the day, it's still Samsung. Not surprised. Rod Samsung and poor software? Not surprised. Marty What else is new? Samsung's not known for quality software. They've gotten better with Touch-Wiz, but that's their pinnacle. Peter World Citizen All compilers should just mark strcpy() as error. ;) bekifft Worse than this, Tizen runs on refrigerators, and all that other "smart" crap. People are connecting this junk to the internet and forgetting about it. This is the kind of stuff that causes problems like Mirai. JohnyNoLegs Linux runs on refrigerators, and all that other smart crap. Are you saying the devs that made all that smart crap did it better? Andy J So..... um...... anyone know what the SmartThings hubs run on then? Are we facing a potential situation where they could be hijacked. D13H4RD2L1V3 Here's something, though. Tizen technically isn't made by Samsung entirely. It's a project within the Linux Foundation and developed and overseen by the Tizen Association. As you'd expect, Samsung is a member, but so are other companies such as Huawei and Intel. Despite that, only Samsung has actually implemented the OS in their products. Given the shocking number of security holes, I can only assume that it was far from ready. Even though Samsung's Android skin is better than previous iterations, I don't particularly hold it in super-high regard because software has never been Samsung's forte. And I think they should make it so soon as their hardware gets better and better. Đức Thành I am not the least bit surprised, but that part about the legacy of Bada OS living on was particularly hilarious. mma173 Software industry especially OSs is a very specialized resource-intensive field. I wish Samsung should give up working on OSs to free up resources. ROB Can he also work on getting Nougat to the unlocked S7s ?

Not only are they flagging more and more videos as ‘not advertiser friendly’, for the past few days they have turned off ALL of the advertising on my videos,” writes  SGT Report. “They want to kill my channel and they want me to go away. I need your help.” SGT Report, along with many other independent media outlets, is now asking for Patreon donations as Google / YouTube demonetizes their videos, forcing them to look for alternative sources of operating revenue. But here’s the thing: SGT Report isn’t a Jiahid recruitment hub. They don’t promote terrorism. They simply have an independent point of view on politics and current events. For this reason alone, Google has demonetized them by labeling their videos “extreme.” Google labels independent media “extremist” by conflating critical thinking with Jihadi terror Under fire for making money off “extremist” videos featuring Jihadi terror tactics, Google has used the issue to deliberately conflate the term “extremist” to block revenues from videos that merely offer an independent point of view on current events. In effect, Google has now decided that any website which supports President Trump is “extremist” and must be demonetized, censored or outright banned from its search results. To the Left-leaning tech giants, you see, any content that isn’t “progressive” is automatically considered “extremist,” even though advertisers who are horrified over Jihadi video content are often thrilled about supporting independent media. This may explain why GoodGopher.com, the independent search engine that indexes independent media, is becoming increasingly popular. Good Gopher indexes thousands of “alternative media” websites while protecting the privacy of users with no search term tracking of users. Leaders of independent media now being targeted by Google for censorship and demonetization As part of an investigation into Google censorship, Natural News has spoken with several other independent media publishers and has confirmed they are all being targeted by Google / YouTube with demonetization censorship. One independent publisher which did not want to be named — they are afraid Google will further punish them for speaking out against censorship — told Natural News their revenues have plummeted 80% since YouTube began its recent demonetization sweep. All News Pipeline, a popular “current events analyst” site that warns readers about the coming financial collapse, details the war on the independent media in this article that decries the fake “fake news” label being used to silence independent journalism. ANP has also been targeted with censorship efforts from Google and YouTube, and the site relies on revenues from advertising storable food (Food For Liberty) and other preparedness items. Another independent publisher and pioneer in citizen journalism, Truth Stream Media, is turning to Amazon affiliate links to help boost its revenues. Yet even this is nothing but a stopgap measure, as TSM’s founders fully realize that Amazon is owned and operated by globalist Jeff Bezos, whose products (Echo, Kindle, Alexa) surveil customers in their own homes. Bezos is also owner of the Washington Post, a fake news publisher that deliberately and repeatedly fabricates fake news to smear the Trump administration. TSM is no doubt seeking better revenue sources that don’t enrich globalist organizations like Amazon. Natural News remains unaffected by the Google demonetization efforts, as we stopped publishing Adsense ads several years ago and never monetized YouTube videos. We also removed Google analytics code from our websites several years ago so that Google could not spy on our readers. A few weeks ago, Google blacklisted the entire Natural News website, removing 140,000+ pages from its index, based entirely on a fabricated technical excuse. After six days of punishment by Google, Natural News content was restored without explanation. This was clearly a “warning” from Google that if we don’t stop growing and reporting the truth, we will be silenced by any means necessary. (Google, Facebook, Twitter and Yahoo have all essentially declared a “war on truth” in order to silence voices they can’t control.) You can support Natural News, if you wish, by shopping for lab-verified organic superfood and household products at the Health Ranger Store. Voice recognition technology turns spoken words into text that’s scanned for a list of “banned” keywords To accomplish the demonetization effort, YouTube’s servers use voice recognition technology to scan the audio of each video, translating audio into text transcripts. That text is then algorithmically compared to a manually chosen list of keywords and phrases that Google’s Left-leaning “social justice engineers” have decided are “extreme.” Instead of merely focusing on terror-related keywords like “Jihad” or “bomb-making,” Google has added keywords likely to flag independent, pro-America media outlets and Donald Trump supporters. Those keywords appear to include “patriot” or “storable food” or even “AR-15.” Other keywords are being flagged by the system in an effort to protect the monopoly profits of the pharmaceutical industry, which explains why terms such as “vaccines” and “mercury” are also being flagged by YouTube for demonetization censorship. (Yes, Google now censors discussions of science and medicine if the opinions of the scientists don’t conform to the corrupt medical establishment.) No doubt, Google will soon add words related to “climate change denialism” to its list so that any person who speaks words critical of the climate change hoax will also be financially punished and run out of business. At the same time, words of intolerance and hatred toward white people are openly allowed. Words that call for violence against Donald Trump are richly rewarded, and attacks on Christian religion seem to be applauded by tech giants like Google and Facebook. The Left, you see, is writhing with hatred and intolerance toward anyone who doesn’t immediately agree with them. This is deemed “tolerance” by the intolerant Left. See my related article: HATRED is tolerance; conformity is diversity; consensus is fact. As published on GovtSlaves.info, another independent media site likely to be targeted by Google, these censorship algorithms have brought an “Orwellian” brand of censorship and oppression to the web: The chief executive of News Corp, parent company of The Sun and Times Newspapers, has warned that digital algorithms at Facebook and Google have “left us perched on the edge of the slippery slope of censorship”… Thomson said: “The word Orwellian is flagrantly used and abused. But when it comes to the all-powerful algorithms of Google, Amazon and Facebook, otherwise known as GAF, Orwellian is unused. The institutional neglect has now left us perched on the edge of the slippery slope of censorship.” Google goes full Orwellian… “word crimes” will now bankrupt your online business if you dare speak the truth The upshot of all this is that Google has gone full Orwellian and is using the crisis of Jihadi video revenues to unleash a punitive demonetization scheme that’s intended to bankrupt anti-establishment voices. Like all Left-leaning technology companies, Google hates Christians but celebrates Islam. Google despises Trump supporters but celebrates Hillary Clinton, one of the most corrupt criminal minds in the history of U.S. politics. Google loves transgenders but hates straight white people. The list goes on… Now, Google is translating its twisted political biases into censorship algorithms in order to silence the voices it doesn’t like by denying them revenues. This is clearly deliberate and intended to exert a kind of Orwellian thought control over the entire population by forcing content creators to make a choice: You can either go along with the Google progressive delusions and be richly rewarded, or you can exercise independent views and be bankrupted. Through this scheme, Google doesn’t even have to overtly block videos that espouse conservative or libertarian views… it can simply demonetize them and let the reality of revenue loss achieve censorship on its own. No one can produce content for free, after all. Sooner or later, you run out of money to fund yourself. If Google gets it way, we are soon going to wake up and find ourselves living in a society where conformity is mandated, and non-conformity means financial devastation. Few publishers of original, independent-minded content can survive in an environment where the tech giants all conspire to silence the independent media through revenue demonetization. This only leads to a society rooted in conformist delusion, where obedience is demanded, independent thinking is punished, and free enterprise isn’t free unless you agree to censor your own thoughts, ideas and words to appease the totalitarian tech giants. In effect, Google is now mandating what can only be called “Liberal Fundamentalism” or a sort of “Jihad of the Left.” In other words, Google is now becoming the very kind of extremist organization they claim to be censoring. They are at war with the truth, and they are happy to unleash any form of online weapon to achieve their fundamentalist goals of total liberal domination. See The Civil War is Here by Daniel Greenfield for a more detailed analysis of this “Jihad of the Left” and why it’s such a danger to society.

Follow his videos, podcasts, websites and science projects at the links below. Mike Adams serves as the founding editor of NaturalNews.com and the lab science director of an internationally accredited (ISO 17025) analytical laboratory known as CWC Labs. There, he was awarded a Certificate of Excellence for achieving extremely high accuracy in the analysis of toxic elements in unknown water samples using ICP-MS instrumentation. Adams is also highly proficient in running liquid chromatography, ion chromatography and mass spectrometry time-of-flight analytical instrumentation. He has also achieved numerous laboratory breakthroughs in the programming of automated liquid handling robots for sample preparation and external standards prep. The U.S. patent office has awarded Mike Adams patent NO. US 9526751 B2 for the invention of “Cesium Eliminator,” a lifesaving invention that removes up to 95% of radioactive cesium from the human digestive tract. Adams has pledged to donate full patent licensing rights to any state or national government that needs to manufacture the product to save human lives in the aftermath of a nuclear accident, disaster, act of war or act of terrorism. He has also stockpiled 10,000 kg of raw material to manufacture Cesium Eliminator in a Texas warehouse, and plans to donate the finished product to help save lives in Texas when the next nuclear event occurs. No independent scientist in the world has done more research on the removal of radioactive elements from the human digestive tract. Adams is a person of color whose ancestors include Africans and American Indians. He is of Native American heritage, which he credits as inspiring his “Health Ranger” passion for protecting life and nature against the destruction caused by chemicals, heavy metals and other forms of pollution. Adams is the founder and publisher of the open source science journal Natural Science Journal, the author of numerous peer-reviewed science papers published by the journal, and the author of the world’s first book that published ICP-MS heavy metals analysis results for foods, dietary supplements, pet food, spices and fast food. The book is entitled Food Forensics and is published by BenBella Books. In his laboratory research, Adams has made numerous food safety breakthroughs such as revealing rice protein products imported from Asia to be contaminated with toxic heavy metals like lead, cadmium and tungsten. Adams was the first food science researcher to document high levels of tungsten in superfoods. He also discovered over 11 ppm lead in imported mangosteen powder, and led an industry-wide voluntary agreement to limit heavy metals in rice protein products. In addition to his lab work, Adams is also the (non-paid) executive director of the non-profit Consumer Wellness Center (CWC), an organization that redirects 100% of its donations receipts to grant programs that teach children and women how to grow their own food or vastly improve their nutrition. Through the non-profit CWC, Adams also launched Nutrition Rescue, a program that donates essential vitamins to people in need. Click here to see some of the CWC success stories. With a background in science and software technology, Adams is the original founder of the email newsletter technology company known as Arial Software. Using his technical experience combined with his love for natural health, Adams developed and deployed the content management system currently driving NaturalNews.com. He also engineered the high-level statistical algorithms that power SCIENCE.naturalnews.com, a massive research resource featuring over 10 million scientific studies. Adams is well known for his incredibly popular consumer activism video blowing the lid on fake blueberries used throughout the food supply. He has also exposed “strange fibers” found in Chicken McNuggets, fake academic credentials of so-called health “gurus,” dangerous “detox” products imported as battery acid and sold for oral consumption, fake acai berry scams, the California raw milk raids, the vaccine research fraud revealed by industry whistleblowers and many other topics. Adams has also helped defend the rights of home gardeners and protect the medical freedom rights of parents. Adams is widely recognized to have made a remarkable global impact on issues like GMOs, vaccines, nutrition therapies, human consciousness. In addition to his activism, Adams is an accomplished musician who has released over fifteen popular songs covering a variety of activism topics.

With that in mind, here we’ve round up the best Google Pixel and Pixel XL cases available. Instead of a Nexus this year Google released two Pixel Phones. One with a 5-inch display and the XL with a big 5.5-inch Quad-HD screen. It’s an all metal phone, but there’s also glass on the back which is one of many reasons a case is recommended. Read: Google Pixel Review: A New Type of Android Below we’ve round up a list of some of the best Pixel cases from brands we know, use and trust. Additionally, these cases come right from Google, are available on Amazon, or are from other trusted outlets. Everything from unique artwork, simple TPU cases, hand-made wood cases, wallets and much more. Google made a few cases of their own at release, which is a growing trend. The company is offering live cases, places cases and other custom options. Alternatively, Google also has some fun colorful choices or polycarbonate hard shell covers. There are plenty of options for owners. As many buyers know, since they’re not made by Samsung or Apple there aren’t as many choices for accessories. That said, Google partnered with big brands to offer good protection. Buyers do have more choices than previous Nexus phones though. More importantly, as more options are released we’ll update with our favorites after they’ve been tested and approved. In closing, your best bet is a case from the Google Store, Amazon, or from trusted brands. We’d recommend Spigen, Speck, Otterbox and others. We offer up great cases from all of those companies and more in our slideshow below. Check out these excellent cases and buy one today. Google Clear Case   1 / 20 First things first, getting a case from the phone maker themselves is typically the best route to take. And if you love the color of that really Blue Pixel or enjoy the two-tone back with the metal and glass design, you'll want a clear case. It doesn't look like much more than a standard TPU case, but it's actually made of a hard and durably polycarbonate plastic. Offering cutouts for all ports, buttons, sensors and more. This is a sleek and minimal way to protect the Pixel or XL. It's available now on the Google Store, but it's expensive.  Buy it from Google for $30   1 / 20 10 Responses 10/09/2016 Stacy Reply Anyone tried the DGtle Anti-Scratches Google Pixel Case?

To learn more about how librarians like you are driving practice across the lifestyle of open access, be sure to visit Open Access in Action. SPONSORED CONTENT Making Open Access Content Discoverable By John Parsons on December 15, 2016 1 Comment Finding the right journal content has always been hard work for scholars and librarians. The move from print to digital was supposed to make that easier—in theory. Data-at-your-fingertips should have meant less stack climbing, less poring over endless endnotes, and better overall results. The reality is far different. Search technology, already in a fragmented state, has been further disrupted by the rise of Open Access (OA). Library information professionals agree. In a recent Library Journal survey, about 72% of all respondents cited OA article discoverability as a major concern. Gold & Green Factors The problem is easy to describe but hard to resolve. Typically, Gold OA publishers have robust search capabilities. But they often use different metadata—sometimes only slightly different—than other OA or subscription-based journals. Indexing services do a respectable job, but they can only collect metadata that publishers choose to provide. Green OA is also problematic. Unequally funded and resourced institutional repositories can have complex, irregularly developed approaches to metadata, which are often incompatible with one another. Even when full text articles are openly available, discovering the right one can become a combination of long hours and luck. Finding the Right Tools There are of course good tools for academic article discovery, as we briefly discussed in April. Not all of them are equal, however. We spoke with University of Texas: MD Anderson Cancer Research Medical Library’s Collections Librarian, Allen Lopez, for more insights on the current discoverability tools. “As librarians, we have to accept that Google Scholar is where many of our folks are going,” Lopez said. “The drawbacks include the sheer mass of hits that a single query generates. More isn’t necessarily a good thing. It’s not humanly possible to evaluate each one. Also, no one outside Google knows the ins and outs of their search algorithm, so we simply don’t know if these links are to reliable sources.” Lopez emphasized the discipline needed to evaluate a Google Scholar finding, including the journal’s peer review process, its reputation, and a willingness to openly discuss methodology. Quantitative metrics such as numbers of views or downloads, should be weighed less heavily, he feels. “We do talk about numbers, but it’s an attempt to apply an objective measurement to a subjective value,” he said. Of course, there are other, discipline-specific tools available “If you’re a serious researcher, you need to go into the individual databases in your field,” Lopez said. For OA, these include PubMed Central for biomedical and life sciences research, JSTOR for a wide variety of arts and sciences disciplines, and the OAJSE for mechanical engineering. Between general tools like Google Scholar and highly specialized databases, Lopez noted several, library-specific applications like Primo, Summon, and EDS. Although these are understandably subscription-based, they are increasingly including Open Access journal content. As OA metadata become more standardized (see below), these discovery tools will become more efficient. The keys to greater OA discoverability include some presumably basic steps. “Journal article authors need to hold to the highest standards of the peer review process—not just publishing for the sake of being published,” Lopez said. “Publishers also need to systematically connect with all the major indexes in their field.” Significantly, Lopez also expressed the desire for a more standard and consistently applied set of metadata—covering not only DOIs and ORCiDs but many other things that librarians struggle with daily. “There are some good, common identifiers out there,” he said, “but they are not required or even consistently applied by every journal. Even something as seemingly simple as volume and issue numbers are not consistent—even within the same journal!” Metadata 2020 Lopez’s wish is shared by many—and may potentially have a solution. We spoke with Crossref’s Director of Member and Community Outreach, Ginny Hendricks, about the persistent, chicken-and-egg dilemma surrounding journal metadata. “To start with, publishers have registered 232 different licenses with us, many of which are easily identifiable as OA because they use e.g. CC-BY versions,” she said. “But we can’t tell for the others without reading the licenses in full. It’s also not just about either Green or Gold; it’s more like a spectrum of openness.” Hendricks noted that all publishers struggle with metadata consistency, and that just because the license is OA, doesn’t make it any less susceptible to the discoverability problem. To address this, Crossref and at least 17 other organizations—including schools, bodies like ORCiD, and even the Wikimedia Foundation, are launching a new initiative—Metadata 2020—next year. Hendricks asked, “What if we could make it easy to include as much information as possible? All the basic stuff but also license info, funding/grant data, ORCiDs, organization IDs, clinical trial data, and—along the way—corrections and retractions? What if it was a simple case of entering once, and watching that work—with clean and “complete” metadata—grow and get added to, permeating through other systems, contributing to research throughout the world?” The campaign’s goal is to build on existing efforts, increasing awareness among publishers, and “rally the community” in promoting more robust, consistent metadata. Besides improving on things like reporting, Metadata 2020 will also pursue new types of incentives—particularly gamification—for publishers to provide better metadata. “All parties in the research enterprise should aim to improve the discoverability of content,” Hendricks said. “Whether they’re funders, authors, preprint servers, publishers, libraries, or repositories, it is in everyone’s interest to add value through search, discovery, annotation, and analyses.” Awareness and application of a common metadata standard is a clear path to that goal.

Mesh Wi-Fi strings a Wi-Fi connection together with the use of multiple routers to create a more consistent coverage area. It also gets rid of a problem that plagues all smart speakers today: Get too far away from Wi-Fi and service is interrupted. Unlike many routers today, mesh Wi-Fi kits often involves the use of two to three devices. More consistent Wi-Fi access means more consistent Google Assistant access, and thus an edge in competition with others in the intelligent assistant and smart speaker market like Microsoft’s Cortana and Amazon’s Alexa. Google Home, which operates using the Google Assistant, is able to do things like answer questions, tell jokes, place orders with more than 50 retailers, and control smart home devices. Google Home can also chat with more than 150 third party actions that can help you cook dinner, read Bible passages, or identify an illness by sharing symptoms with the WebMD action. The Google Assistant is also available on Pixel smartphones, the Allo chat app, Android smartphones using Marshmallow or Nougat operating systems, and soon Android TV. The mesh Wi-Fi market today includes established router makers like Linksys and Netgear alongside startups like Plume and Eero. Google entered the mesh Wi-Fi market last December with Google Wifi. Samsung introduced a mesh network router system last month on the same day as its Bixby intelligent assistant that will be integrated into other Samsung devices. Roughly a year ago, Amazon took part in a $12.5 million investment round in mesh Wi-Fi startup Luma and its Home WiFi System.

The first is Google Home, the speaker-equipped unit loaded with the Google Assistant. Secondly, they’re also pushing a mesh Wifi router –simply known as Google Wifi — for all your home networking needs. But according to The Information, Google wants to combine those 2 things into one. The result would be a mesh Google Wifi router that also has speakers and a microphone for Google Home functionality. Google Wifi. Why haven’t they already done so? Google apparently didn’t want to confuse consumers by creating an all-in-one product, a marketing issue that we’re pegging as valid. The two products do very different things and in Google’s quest to provide a simple “it just works” experience it’d be tough to communicate the goodness of one super device through traditional marketing. We’re not sure what or who could cause them to change their mind less than a year after its launch, though we’re not going to complain as we definitely wouldn’t mind seeing it. local_offer    Google Assistant   Google Home   Google WiFi   Smart home   Auto-load comments: Off On View comments (4) stars Further Reading 10 new actions have been added to the Google Home's arsenal OnePlus confirms Google Assistant is on its way Google Assistant adds sports jokes Funny video shows frustrations with Google Home Deal: 2 Google Homes for $229 stars Popular this Weeklaunch 1 more_vertWorld's thinnest case for the Google Pixel closeThe thinnest case possible for your Google Pixel [VIDEO] My quest to find the world’s thinnest case for the Google Pixel has finally ended.

The Information: Google plans to release a Google Home with mesh networking Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/05 10:03am PDTApr 5, 2017 28 Plus 1 on G+ 25 Share on Facebook 50 Share on Twitter Total Shares103 Google Google Home Google Wifi News Ever since the release of the first Chromecast, Google has been working hard to establish a place in your home. Last year's $129 Google Home was a major release, but it seems like Google isn't stopping there. According to a report from The Information, Google is working on an upgraded version of the Home to compete with the Amazon Echo. From "a person with knowledge of the project," the new product will be a Google Home with built-in Wi-Fi capabilities. Much like the Google WiFi, which was launched around the same time as the Home, it can act as a router and as part of a larger mesh network. This can probably be best described as Google WiFi with Assistant built-in. A person with knowledge of the project told The Information, "They want to have complete coverage of Wi-Fi in the house. Alphabet’s goal is to get more devices in the home that do more. Coverage of Wi-Fi is a huge pain point." I'm a bit skeptical. This new upgraded Home would definitely cost more than the existing model, and support for non-Google networks is unknown. I'm sure the Assistant functionality will work on any Wi-Fi network, but how will it work for networks not using a Google WiFi/new Home as the router? Hopefully we'll find out soon.

Instead of having 4 devices in my house, I could have two - and the cost should scale I'd imagine - maybe $200/device means $400 sunk cost vs. $520. Jimmy Roche So I bought the Google home and the Google onhub, so I'll buy the Google wifi home onhub thing so that I get +3 exp on Google play games when I use my Google pixel on my Google Chromecast over Google fiber FRKSUP #Invested Josh Phillips I have 3 Google Wifi pucks... I also have Google Homes in those same rooms. Makes way too much sense to come from Google, but I very much look forward to this. Chris Sanner I would've looked forward to this *before* I bought two google homes and the three-pack of wifis... OligarchyAmbulance Yeah this seems a bit ridiculous to come out with these after we've all already bought their routers and Home's separately. Morten Ulv I guess people won't need those things in the future. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Now you will be able to put one more google device in the same rooms James Briano Add a proprietary messaging app and I'm sold. Serge Cebrian why only one when they can make several! Suicide_Note Price this one at $129, cut the price of the regular Home to $89. JD No thanks Goog I'll guard my own perimeter thanks. Unless this Router has sticker packs! Ryan oh cool so it's what we all thought the OnHub was supposed to be with its built-in microphone. but now we have to buy both a new mesh system and more homes to replace the old ones. pass. MJ This makes a lot of sense and could save some people a little money. Now, how about a Google WiFi base with a four port switch for people that would like that? Not that it matters to me... I was interested in Google WiFi at one point but decided a router that someone else ultimately controls is just plain stupid. OhYeah! Google doesn't control the google wifi, it's the same as any other mesh network. Also you could just turn off wifi on your current router and hook the google wifi to that to have more lan ports and have googles mesh wifi. MJ Maybe using the word "control" was to strong but you did see this right? https://www.extremetech.com/electronics/245009-google-accidentally-resets-onhub-google-wifi-routers-server-error I don't need any hardware devices (beyond my phone) tried to my Google account. Suppose one doesn't have a working router already or prefers less devices laying around... Defenestratus Don't need it. I have a 3200sqft home and my Netgear R8500 reaches all corners of my home with signal strength enough to stream netflix just fine. I do need about 3 more Google homes though. Since they got it working with the Harmony hub its become even invaluable than just controlling my smartThings hub. Alec M router, modem, tv box, google home combo?? Paulo I wish they would focus on an unobtrusive and inexpensive assistant module with a decent speaker like the echo dot. Put one in every room that doesn't need high fidelity and my smart home is fully voice activated on the cheap. Integrate intercom capabilities and my dream is complete. The echo dots serve my home automation purposes for now but the knowledge graph is really lacking. Let's see if the Nvidia spot ever comes to fruition. Corbin Davenport Yeah, an Echo Dot with Google Assistant would be great. Defenestratus Still waiting on my 2017 SHIELD to get assistant. Corbin Davenport Tablets aren't getting Assistant. Brandon David Obert I think he is taking about the Shield TV kerrhome Add in z-wave and zigbee and we're all set. Corbin Davenport That would be great, actually. So now you just have a mega Google Home to replace your router, SmartThings Hub/other smarthome hub, and speaker. Serge Cebrian #ReplaceAllTheSmartThings!!! Gerardo Sarabia I thought that was the point of all this stuff when they started announcing it. To integrate it into one simple product. But then they made separate products and services that didn't really work together and instead competes with each other. I hope they get it right but seems kind of early for a Google Home upgrade. bekifft No this makes perfect sense based on Google's history. Google doesn't do crazy stuff like "one simple product". They make separate products, that compete. Then they drop support for them and do it all over again. Luxferro I'll never go back to consumer wifi/routers. DistortStatic Meaning? supersanborn Can't wait to see that it's priced greater than the sum of Google WiFi and Google Home. James Sarino I was thinking of getting a second OnHub to increase my range, and a second Home for use at another location in the house. If this revised Google Home/mesh comes out soon, that would be killing two birds with one stone for me! Simon Seems like they are stealing others ideas. This one looks much better. https://youtu.be/pufR8uJAAw0 Frawlz Oh great... now my wifi won't even listen to me. SHunter Cant we just build in Wifi Mesh Router, Smoke Alarm, CO2 detector, and google assistant into ONE device? Then mount it where you would put smoke detectors. (This would be a wired version, not battery) Jose Romero Next year they will unmerge it. JG IMHO, Google should have done this from the start. As I was plotting out how I wanted to set up my house, I noted that I was thinking of putting both a Home and WiFi in the same rooms (the living room and bedroom). These are the two rooms I spend the bulk of my time in when I'm at home. They're going to be where I want to be able to just call out queries to have answered and also where I want to have the best WiFi coverage. Sure, they're snazzy enough they can each be set out in the middle of the room (as opposed to standard "scary alien" looking routers with antennas sticking out of everywhere). But it's still, I only have so much shelf space in each room, and an even more limited number of outlets. Combining a Home and a WiFi into a single unit would save space, there would be less wires to get tangled and one less outlet would be consumed. And while it may cost more than the Home itself, it probably would cost less than a Home and WiFi unit bought separately... lgg4 Makes sense...I've wondered that as looking at our G WiFi and home sitting next to each other in our kitchen 4Ui812 After this is released whats next from Google ? Why it's Google home version 3 which will be released 2 years after version 2. And Google wouldn't be Google if they didn't remove something from that was useful in the previous iteration. Version 3 will lack a voice assistant because ..... Hey it's Google. That's reason enough. bekifft I hope along with this they announce a major upgrade of the existing Home's Assistant functionality. Starting to feel like I wasted my money Nicholas Conrad Don't forget, Home has pogo pins under a sticker on the bottom. Portable battery powered Home with charging base also inbound. Maybe the charging base doubles as the wifi puck. #MakesTOOMuchSense Ordeith All your data are belong to us. -Google Mike I Just a note. This home Assistant is supposed to conjure up the image of a cup of latte.

An Israeli security researcher takes a good look at Samsung's Tizen, labels it the worst code he has ever seen Jordan Palmer Follow View All Posts 2017/04/04 11:26am PDTApr 4, 2017 64 Plus 1 on G+ 276 Share on Facebook 74 Share on Twitter Total Shares414 News Samsung Android is a hulking beast as far as global user share is concerned — hell, it's the most-used operating system in the world, surpassing even Windows (in terms of internet usage). When Samsung announced that it was creating its own open-source alternative to Google's mobile OS, it was not really a surprise. We've had several upstarts over the years, like Sailfish, Firefox OS, Ubuntu Touch, and so on, but all of them have failed in some form or another. There were a few people, however, who thought Sammy could be the one to unseat Google and Android with a mobile operating system that it called Tizen. Whether it's pronounced TEE-zen or TIE-zen is still a mystery (Wikipedia and I say it's the latter), but up until now, word on the integrity and security of the code has been relatively scant. Israeli researcher Amihai Neiderman finally dove into Tizen's guts to see what he could find. According to his report to Motherboard, what he found wasn't good. Niederman claims that the operating system contains what "may be the worst code [he's] ever seen" with signs of amateur mistakes/practices and no less than 40 zero-day vulnerabilities. All of those 40 allow for remote-code execution, which permits nefarious parties to access and assume varying levels of control of a Tizen device. Remember, there are quite a few devices running Samsung's OS, including the Gear smartwatches and some phones. One of the most critical vulnerabilities was in the Tizen Store (the equivalent of the Play Store or App Store), which allowed Niederman to inject malicious code into his Samsung TV (also running Tizen). His conclusion from this was that you as a hypothetical third-party could "update a Tizen system with any malicious code you want." Even the store's authentication measures weren't enough — he just used a heap-overflow vulnerability (which he also discovered) to hijack the software before the security protocols activated. Moving on, Niederman says that Tizen's code base is quite outdated and even borrows some elements from Bada, its predecessor. However, he claims that most of the issues he found were in the new code, which was written in the last two years or so. Some of the mistakes are those one might find programmers making twenty years ago. As Motherboard puts it, this shows that Sammy lacks any basic code development or review practices. To prove his point, Niederman points to one example that he claims was everywhere in Tizen, strcpy(). Basically, strcpy() is a flawed function that is easily exploitable and is not used anymore because of that, yet it is supposedly prevalent in Tizen. To top everything off, Niederman says that the programmers failed to use SSL encryption in certain areas during specific data transmissions. This led him to conclude that they made the wrong assumptions on what needed to be encrypted and purposefully left out SSL in those places. When he initially reached out to Samsung to declare his findings, he was greeted with an automated response. Motherboard's attempts to contact the Korean conglomerate resulted only in the basic PR drivel about the company's focus on security and whatnot. However, after the original article got published, Sammy reached out again to Motherboard to claim that it was working with Niederman to resolve the issues, who corroborated this by saying he was in talks with the corporation. You can read more at the source link below if you're interested. Honestly, I can't say that I'm too surprised. As Mr. Niederman puts it, Samsung should reconsider deploying Tizen to its appliances and future phones before doing a serious overhaul on the code. I find that I agree with him.

(Sarcasm because even google/apple has shitty code haha) F4LL0U7 But by all means, let's spend $900 on the new Galaxy phone, because I'm sure it's both immune to their terrible code, and totally worth the price tag. Ome Dries The S8 doesn't use Tizen though, so your phone should be safe... your Samsung powered fridge is a different story Leonardo Baez Or their line of smartwatch John Doe Yeah but they probably use the same programmers for Tizen and Android. kalehv I wouldn't think so. Tizen and Android are very very different inside out. demarcmj Probably not the same programmers, but the culture, processes, etc. are probably the same. Just this. the general attitude can't (and won't) be different MJ No... The Android and Tizen programmers are most certainly on different teams and only deal with their platform. This does not mean Samsung as a whole is good at software. John Doe We don't know if they really are on different teams unless Samsung told you. MJ I wouldn't know if Samsung employs cows for programmers unless they told me but I can almost guarantee the teams are separate. Programming teams at any company tend to specialize on ONE project at a time. It's not the same guys... There will be a small number of top programmers who will move from team to to team to fix problems or help with deadlines. John Doe "I can almost guarantee the teams are separate" No you can't unless you are an employee there and know what Samsung is doing. Samsung is not your typical silicon valley tech company so I have no idea how they work. MJ It's funny your whole argument is there is no way we can know how they do it at Samsung yet you had no problem making the statement the Android and Tizen programmers are probably the same which would be a totally unusual setup for any company with large programmer teams. Why not just go with they are probably cows which is why their software is so bad. LOL John Doe They probably are cows :) F4LL0U7 Right, but my point is that their code is crap, and they're making tons of "enhancements" to the Android OS, plus the dozens of Google apps they unnecessarily duplicate. Their terrible code makes a huge impact on the Android ecosystem. tim242 They don't unnecessarily duplicate anything. Samsung has many apps that are far superior to Google's bloatware. John Doe https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e46717cc007988df31954f458f30b8b237b2c4e803101752d08debfaa155bcf3.gif tim242 Samsung Pay>Android Pay Samsung Browser>Chrome John Doe Samsung pay is greater how exactly? And no on the browser I used Samsung's browser it is not as good as chrome. tim242 Ummm I can use Samsung Pay everywhere. As for the browser, you are full of shit. John Doe Umm that is hardware not software, Samsung bought looppay to do that and it has nothing to do with Samsung's software. Chrome is the most used browser in the world...facts. tim242 It is hardware and software, you know like Android Pay uses NFC. You aren't very smart. As for the browser, since when does most used equal best? McDonald's burgers are the most popular burgers, but nobody will claim them to be the best. Do better. John Doe Wow lmao. Looppay uses MST like your credit card so very little software is needed for it to work. You just need to store credit card information. with NFC there is more communications on both ends and more authentication is required. It is more secure than Magnetic strips. But at the end of the day when it comes to software Apple pay and Android Pay are much better (Design, speed, ease of use, etc) I have used Samsung's browser it is featureless. Chrome has a lot of features that I use and it is fast. I save my passwords in chrome, I have data saver, Read later, cached pages for quick reload, Google AMP, autofill is synced, better privacy controls and Do Not Track, Google translate embedded, and fine grain controls for sites accessing camera, microphone, notifications, etc. Samsung's browser is small potatoes compared to Chrome. AbbyZFresh If you've used Samsung's browser, then you would know it's speed >>>>> Chrome is well worth less features in the way John Doe Bitch please you are a bigger troll than Tim and you are a Google hater. Why are you even here? tim242 Your ignorance/stupidity is really showing. MST uses tokenization just the same as NFC. You should educate yourself before commenting about something you know nothing about. Samsung Pay is superior, deal with it. Samsung's browser is lighter, and has more features. You can log into sites with your fingerprint. Try that in Chrome. You can also use an ad blocker plugin. Try that in Chrome. Oh, and it is Chromium based. That means it has a lot of Chrome features as well. Do better John Doe What does tokenization have to do with using the app? We are comparing Samsung Pay with Android pay here and you said samsung pay is better because you can use it anywhere that has nothing to do with samsung pay dumbass that is looppay which samsung bought. It has nothing to do with the actual software. When it comes to the actual app the design, speed and ease of use of Android and Apple pay is better than samsung pay. Chrome still has a lot more features that the two you mentioned. But I can't change the mind of an ignorant troll. A troll is a troll is a troll. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/70cffa9c6cf517883f23a7ea527e30ffa7ecb7b3f6c82e8599d47b0b1cca584e.gif tim242 LoopPay does not exist. Samsung bought it and incorporated it into Samsung Pay, which makes it better than Android Pay. Tokenization means it is not insecure, as you claimed. You are the obvious troll. You make no sense at all. John Doe Looppay is a hardware feature it has very little to do with the app that is like saying I can use 3.5mm headphones with my music app compared to the iPhone. It is a hardware feature but the app at the end of the day is judged separate from that. You are truly fucken moron and deserve a note 7. tim242 LoopPay was the name of a company that no longer exists. MST was bought by Samsung and is part of Samsung Pay. Hardware can't work without software. Why you are trying to separate the two, is beyond me. Take the tech that Google bought from SoftCard/ISIS out of Android Pay, and see how far that NFC chip gets you. You are now on block, as your stupidity is too much for me. John Doe Samsung bought looppay and its patents so you can't have MST on other devices. We are comparing Samsung with Google here so you have to compare only the software not the harware (This whole fucken article is about software and samsung's incompetence). You are fucken retarted Softcard/ISIS was bought for Google wallet not Android pay and it was because carriers blocked Google wallet so Google bought softcard which was made by the carriers. Samsung pay sucks, period. "Samsung Pay's security measures are based on Samsung Knox and ARM TrustZone technologies; credit card information is stored in a secure token.[3] Payments must be authenticated using a fingerprint scan.[6][7] In August 2016, security researcher Salvador Mendoza disclosed a potential flaw with Samsung Pay, arguing that its security tokens were not sufficiently randomized and could become predictable. He also designed a handheld device that could be used to skim magnetic secure transmission tokens, and another which could spoof magnetic stripes on actual card readers using the token. Samsung responded to the report, stating that "If at any time there is a potential vulnerability, we will act promptly to investigate and resolve the issue".[8]" http://www.zdnet.com/article/flaw-in-samsung-pay-lets-hackers-wirelessly-skim-credit-cards/ Middlefinger Just because people are forced to use chrome on Android it doesnt mean its the best. Its the new IE, its terrible on mobile and hardly better on desktop. MJ Who are these people who are forced to use Chrome on Android? John Doe They are not forced to use it. Chrome doesn't come preloaded on desktop but it is still the number one because people go and download it. And it doesn't come preloaded on all Android phones. Middlefinger Yes, it is on every Android phone. If people chose Chrome over Firefox then thats their own problem and its not like FF is perfect either. John Doe It is not on every Android phone. And they choose it because they like it and want to use it. Middlefinger Its compulsory according to the Android licensing agreement, if you want Google play access. John Doe The play store is not on every Android phone...its not on any phone in china for example and the Mobile Application Distribution Agreement is optional and Google chrome is not even set to default and is hidden in a folder on Samsung devices so no one is forcing anyone to do anything here. Middlefinger Its on every phone that has access to the play store. What china does is not relevant to this so dont deflect. You know full well what i was referring to, not that it will stop you claiming victory as is usual on here. Its not hidden, its right on the damn home screen on international unlocked OEM devices. John Doe You said "*EVERY* android phone has Google Chrome". There are plenty of Android phones that do not sign that agreement and do not have the play store on them also the agreement is negotiated with Google including what apps to include. This agreement is also signed with carriers so Google, OEMs and the carriers negotiate it. And yes it is hidden in the US carrier version because I had to go through the app list, open the folder, click on it to use it and also have to make it default...it is not set to default. This was on an S7 edge. https://landing.google.com/intl/en/androidisforusers/faq.html https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-4a46Ko8RE Middlefinger Newsflash, the world doesnt revolve around US carriers.. On the first point.. well done, you won on a technicality that neither of us were even talking about anyway. John Doe That is where OEMs sell the majority of their phones through carriers and specifically US carriers not international unlocked phones which samsung doesn't even update on time (But that is another issue). But even in the international unlocked phone I am sure the S7 also does not have chrome as the default browser. Middlefinger My Samsung devices do, as did my LGs, HTCs and so on (including network branded ones). Some US carriers may have other things installed and set to default, but its the exception in the world. Either way Google requires its bloat be installed, and i dont see that as any better than Samsungs. John Doe You may think is bloat but the billions of Google users out there do not think so go download what you like. Shame-sung C.E.O Swinesung Pay is Garbage. Don't fall for this guys Sheep Mentallity. This is the same person who said CURRENT-C was going to be the winner out of Payment wars LOL!! No joke he was the biggest shill for Months. Shame-sung C.E.O https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d20aef0fbc504aadabb8bd8fde48166d56c8b76806fd4b9f3e699fb0f3c88c9a.jpg https://media.giphy.com/media/l3E6uhDAN3W7vylji/giphy.gif LMFAO!!! LineOS for exynos! I know Samsung browser is based on chromium... But he say 'better' becouse ad blocker... If chrome have ad blocker is will be faster.. that for sure Suicide_Note Two hardly qualifies as 'many apps'. tim242 That was just two examples. Another example is Messages. I have to use Samsung Messages, because Google forces pop up messages, unless you silence them altogether. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages all the time, but I'm not aware of any pop-up messages. Or are you referring to the way the message notification pops up? tim242 Yes, the notifications. Google took the option out of the settings to disable that nonsense. Samsung put the option into their app. Why is Google forcing that on us? It is annoying to have them interrupt what I am doing, and disregards privacy Suicide_Note I like it since i can see if i need to reply immediately or not, or just dismiss it to the notification tray, but to each their own. Good thing we have so many options to choose from. 😊 tim242 Yeah, I would use Google Messenger, if only I could disable that. Knowing Google, they may add that back later. JohnyNoLegs Google doesn't even have an audio recording app LOL. Google has barely anything. Literally BARE Middlefinger amung browser is superior to chrome. A carrier Pigeon is better than chrome, at least Samsung internet actually exits properly when you press the back button. John Doe So go use a carrier pigeon...troll LoL If you like Samsung and their programming skills go buy a Tizen phone Middlefinger I prefer Samsung to Google anyway. Android is a damn mess and getting worse again. Sure 7 is better than the total disaster that was kitkat, but its worse than anything since KK. John Doe Ok so go get a Tizen phone http://www.samsung.com/in/smartphones/samsung-z3/ Middlefinger I prefer Samsungs mods to Android to Googles 'stock', Samsung actually seem to test it before breaking everyone devices. John Doe That is because everyone's device is already broken (Laggy, buggy, slow, and filled with unnecessary apps). Middlefinger Like most of the Google apps, yeah you're right. John Doe Google's apps are updated continually and are stable than the majority of OEM apps since they are mostly updated by OTA instead of through the play store like all of Google's apps. Anyways, that doesn't change the fact that Samsung's software is laggy and terrible...it also gets worse over time which is just sad. And the fact that they take forever to update their phones does not help your argument. Middlefinger Firstly thats horseshit, Google apps are just as unstable as any. Secondly Samsungs launcher can be laggy, jsut like Googles can be painfully limited, so dont use either. The rest of the Samsung mods are better than Googles, especially the notification pulldown. Ive already addressed the update thing. If Google was pushing 7.1.1 to every device in the world there would be hundreds of millions that randomly rebooted. The OEMs test better and it takes time. Older thats stable and fixed is better than newer and broken. John Doe Firstly thats horseshit, Google apps are just as unstable as any. I use Google's apps daily and they are not unstable actually they are highly rated in the play store compared to samsung's apps and are used by way more people that just shows how stable they are. Unless you are using beta version, heck even the beta version is stable so I have no idea what you are talking about. There are always problems with updates even Apple has them with iOS but the difference is Google can push out a fix quickly like Apple. Also with new updates you get security patches and fixes for older bugs that take months to fix when going through OEMs and carriers. If you think Samsung's programming is good go check the article you are commenting on LoL. Middlefinger So what if google can and does patch things quickly, it shouldn't get broken in the first place. This just doesn't happen with most OEM devices, and hasnt to a single one ive ever had. My Nexus devices have been a string of bad hardware, poor software, show stopping faults and RMAs. John Doe I have had several nexus devices and pixel and I have never had severe problems to a point where I had to send it in. There are bugs like any other OEM especially samsung but Google has the ability to fix them quickly. Newflash, it does happen with a lot of OEMs including Apple. This isn't new anyways Google's software is highly praised on the pixel compared to Samsung's "horseshit". Go check the reviews. Middlefinger Im sure the 9 people that have a Pixel just loved the reboots. Nice its fixed, shame it ever happened. Never had severe problem eh? Ive never had ANY with anything except the Nexus'. Highly praised is it? By who exactly? If its the same people that bought the Nexus then they are easily pleased and highly biased. You cant deny there is an entire body of fanboys out there that love AOSP, regardless of how bad it is. If google just secretly used all Samsungs code for 8 it would be the best thing ever, because bias blinds. John Doe 9 people? classy. Nice joke. Never had severe problem eh? Ive never had ANY with anything except the Nexus'. You just lost all credibility just stop. All the tech blogs gave it excellent reviews and said it was the best Android phone available even tech blogs that favor Apple said so and that says a lot. Middlefinger Yeah, OK. Zero Mizukami What didnt you like about kitkat? I was always under the impression kitkat was more or less the pinnacle of Android Audio Totally disagree. There are no Samsung apps on my S7 that I actually use. tim242 That's you. I use Samsung Pay every day, to pay for everything. Samsung's browser is far superior to Chrome. I use Samsung's SMS app, because Google forces pop up messages on theirs. F4LL0U7 That's your opinion, and of course I have my own. It was just a little frustrating when I started my work GS7 for the first time and saw two of nearly every app. As a Nexus/Pixel guy, I'm horrified at Samsung's terrible (in my opinion) design and functionality standards. Not to mention the 3rd party garbage they toss in there too. I had to purchase an app that allows me to disable their default apps. When your first task in the process of setting up a new phone is to wade through and remove the bloat, there's something wrong there. tim242 I purchased a package disabler as well. But I also had to disable a lot of Google bloatware as well. John Doe You need to look up the term bloatware. Lookup, Microsoft office, facebook, and all the other unnecessary apps that don't need to be preinstalled are bloatware. Anyways I don't know what I am arguing with you samsung phones are burning up...literally so unless samsung sells 100+ million s8 they will always be behind apple. tim242 Behind apple haha you are silly. John Doe Why is that silly? They are behind Apple in the smartphone business. tim242 That is not true. Get educated, then comment. John Doe Lmao http://www.techtimes.com/articles/188124/20161208/apple-iphone-7-is-the-best-selling-smartphone-in-us-trumping-the-samsung-galaxy-s7-kantar.htm https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/56f89a4335e2c7fe807cdebf208e142c62b61a5cec127b30c1f4b3c96aee3961.gif tim242 Lmao that is just the S7. Samsung has many other smartphones. You are trying to move the goalposts. Try harder John Doe http://bgr.com/2017/02/03/apple-vs-samsung-sales-2016/ http://www.businessinsider.com/samsung-galaxy-apple-iphone-premium-market-share-chart-2016-12 https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/10/16/samsung-galaxy-vs-iphone-which-product-line-has-so.aspx Apple beat Samsung with 3 Phones....Samsung had 31. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/13806899d2dd953b00745e25586ce63bc99bfb72ae0d42ccd3bbb42fa9c618b5.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78dd8b407e1ea19bc331dea202aae34c0cb0772bea409ff56a11d2efb86e7f9d.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/91444a76a0ec89e25770a31b864244d9c04aad4f64e7c6152e993058b5c82bb9.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/688053d5bd7c128160ba9a9dfe79639b542955188e91c63913e08ee14faa1f85.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e9eb24fa3eae7253df33b2eb97d2250c7c498213eec6de868a759657891aad6b.png JohnyNoLegs Yea like Pixel Launcher, Hangouts, Daydream haha byteseyes Google apps are definitely bloatware. There's tons of Google bloatware I delete every time I get a new device with Android on it. Granted, I think Samsung and Google should get a pass for including their software because it's Samsung's hardware and part Samsung and part Google's software. Completely 3rd party companies like carriers or Microsoft stuffing their software is the worst kind of bloatware. John Doe Google apps are not bloatware because people do use them and they are useful. Bloatware means apps that people don't use and waste space on your device. Google's apps definitly do not waste space and the majority of them are used so no they are not bloatware. These are the apps Google requires most are Google play apps: Google Chrome Google Maps Google Drive YouTube Gmail Google+ (The only one I think is unnecessary) Google Play Music Google Play Movies Google Play Books Google Play Newsstand Google Play Games Google Photos Hangouts (Probably stopped requiring it already) byteseyes Your conclusion that Google apps are not bloatware rests on the premise that people use them. By the same token, Samsung apps are not bloatware because people do use them and they are useful. Realistically, I can count on 2 hands the number of people I've come across who use Google Play Music, Movies, Books, Newsstand, Games, Photos, Hangouts, and Google+. Most people I know do use YouTube and Maps the most, while Chrome is forced onto people often. Drive is a wash. That means almost all of Google's apps are not commonly used, hence waste space. So don't you think it's unfair and untrue to make the assumption that people use Google apps, while simultaneously making the unfair and untrue assumption that people don't use Samsung apps? I personally love Samsung apps and I find most of Google's apps redundant. I can understand if people are vice versa. Haha, sorry, I didn't mean this response to be too long, so all boiled down, Samsung and Google apps are either both bloatware or both not. Hope you can understand that they can not be different. John Doe Fact is that far more people use Google's apps than Samsung's you can check the play store reviews and how many people use them. Google's services are used way more often than Samsung's that is a known fact. Google and Samsung do not release numbers of every single app but Google has a billion+ monthly active users on some of their services. When it comes to the Google play apps, they come in a package with the play store. It makes no fucken sense to have a music section in the play store and no app to play it with. They are a package. Chrome is not "forced" on people. You need to lookup what that word means and Chrome is not even set as default on samsung devices so how the hell is it "forced"? That means almost all of Google's apps are not commonly used, hence waste space. It is silly to make a statement like that So don't you think it's unfair and untrue to make the assumption that people use Google apps, while simultaneously making the unfair and untrue assumption that people don't use Samsung apps? No because like stated above Google has more than billion+ active users on their services and highly rated apps in the play store and they a regularly updated. Samsung on the other hand has even discontinued multiple apps and services because no one is using them like Samsung milk music. https://play.google.com/store/apps/collection/search_results_cluster_apps?clp=ggEJCgdzYW1zdW5n:S:ANO1ljLMiXA https://play.google.com/store/apps/collection/search_results_cluster_apps?clp=ggEICgZnb29nbGU%3D:S:ANO1ljIY5oM Bloatware apps are determined by the user and I am positive that more users find Google's apps in a favorable light than Samsung's. You are in the minority. byteseyes "Fact is that far more people use Google's apps than Samsung's you can check the play store reviews and how many people use them. Google's services are used way more often than Samsung's that is a known fact. Google and Samsung do not release numbers of every single app but Google has a billion+ monthly active users on some of their services." YouTube and Maps are the most popular. The majority of Google apps are not used at all by most people. But that doesn't matter. The point is lots of people use Google apps, and lots of people use Samsung apps too. You can't ignore one group of people even if it's one order of magnitude smaller. It's still a significant number. "When it comes to the Google play apps, they come in a package with the play store. It makes no fucken sense to have a music section in the play store and no app to play it with. They are a package." Many people don't use them. I'm just using your own assumption and logic. I personally deleted them. Whether it makes sense or not to include them is irrelevant. Of course from a company's perspective it almost always makes sense to include their own service. That's business. You're inclined to make justifications for Google but not for others. "Chrome is not "forced" on people. You need to lookup what that word means and Chrome is not even set as default on samsung devices so how the hell is it "forced"?" It's not forced on Samsung devices thank god. But anyway, instead of on smartphones, I was just remembering off the top of my head about the Chrome browser slipping its way into many people's computers, so I was going off a tangent there. "It is silly to make a statement like that" It's pure logic. "No because like stated above Google has more than billion+ active users on their services and highly rated apps in the play store and they a regularly updated. Samsung on the other hand has even discontinued multiple apps and services because no one is using them like Samsung milk music." Again, that's not the case for almost all of Google's apps. Most of Google's apps are not commonly used. Google also discontinues or leaves as zombies apps that no one uses. "Bloatware apps are determined by the user" That's what I've been saying all along. "and I am positive that more users find Google's apps in a favorable light than Samsung's. You are in the minority." Of course a software-centric company is going to have a larger user base. I may be in the minority, but it's still a large number of people. We're not talking about 1 user vs 1 million. If there's 1 user, and an app is installed to cater to that one 1 user, then it would be bad to include the app. But many, many, many people use Samsung apps too. You can't cherry pick what you like and ignore everything that others like. John Doe Exactly so going back to my original comment that Google's apps are not bloatware and that apps from Facebook, Microsoft, and Lookout are bloatware. Also when Samsung has two music apps like Google play music and Milk on their devices and they end up discontinuing Milk because no one uses it that is also bloatware. So I am glad we cleared up your confusion on whether Google's apps are "definitly bloatware" https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/04d006e4bd2b9525b0b0e9550444617ee69614c33bf605ad372243dc9af02410.png byteseyes Logic must not be your strong suit. John Doe Good Job nice comeback byteseyes Thanks. byteseyes I can understand your viewpoint. Me personally, I find most of Google's apps redundant because I really love Samsung's apps. I actually did the same as you haha! I purchased an app to delete all of Google's apps except Youtube and Maps and a few of Samsung's too. I think there are people who use Samsung apps and people who use Google apps. Not referring to you, but some people like to think Google apps are not bloatware because they themselves use them. But many people also love and use Samsung apps, myself included. Even though I love Samsung apps, I can totally understand if people are vice versa. Logically speaking, either both Samsung and Google apps are both bloatware or both not. dabug91 Lol, umm Samsung has it's own calendar app, calculator app, memo app, messaging app, etc and they're all shit. No phone has more bloatware than a Samsung phone. They win hands-down in that category. tim242 I prefer all of those to Google's offerings. I'm glad to have a choice. OligarchyAmbulance You honestly think they have higher standards for their lagfest Android skin? tim242 They have higher standards than Google/HTC with the dumpster fire that is Pixel. John Doe https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a1405ef722a16da1e676294296d43a0d524eaaf5c53be0f4ec6d89b9ab035eb1.gif M. Luciano What? Where are you getting all this? tim242 There have been numerous hardware issues reported since release. Some of which being the microphone, speakers, camera, and the display. tekfr33kn I've had my Pixel for a few months now and haven't had a single one of those problems. I know that a few people have had them but it's more rare than you you are making it out to be. Audio Or for Knox for that matter! Bob http://imgur.com/gallery/UrhOtai Middlefinger No it uses Android, which we all know is perfect/ s ... At least Samsung fixes the mess Google creates most of time though. Jumanji! Are you perhaps conflating user experience with quality/security of code? A company can make something look pretty or function, but that doesn't mean there aren't any issues with the security of their code. Computer science isn't an exact science and creating software is always a series of trade offs. Middlefinger No im basing it on all the problem Google has with its own devices and how much time OEMs have to spend fixing Google code before they release it on their own devices. Jumanji! What do you expect? Android is a big, complex platform and there are a number of OEMs who blend it with their own, unique hardware variations and services. It's absolutely normal for customers to find defects in shipping products. It's ultimately how the company reacts to customer facing defects and issues that really matters. I'd love to see a list of the volume of defects that OEMs have fixed in the Android platform. I think data has the potential of strengthening your arguments rather than having them appear to be nothing but hyperbole. Middlefinger Not all fixes they make is committed back to stock. Much of what the OEMs do is proprietary, but given that OEM devices dont have the problems AOSP based devices do its reasonable to say they fixed something. If all the Google devices had identical hardware you could argue the problem is which specific hardware, but thats not the case. Regardless of the hardware the problem persists because the problems are in Googles code. Zsolt V You are right in everything you wrote. Congrats, finally a sane voice. F4LL0U7 If that was sincere and not sarcastic, thanks! JohnyNoLegs Haha doesn't run Tizen. Fail. Google code their own bugs anyway. F4LL0U7 No shit, try reading the rest of the thread. Vivek Rameses That's odd, some people think Israel is worst place humanity has ever seen. Sruly J Do you get a thrill connecting politics go something totally not related to that? Suicide_Note And that has to do with Samsung's poor coding......how, exactly? https://media.giphy.com/media/Qy9hRuWrKjY2I/giphy.gif Vivek Rameses Just pointing out facts. Sruly J Which are totally irrelevant to this topic. Vivek Rameses Shouldn't be in the title then. No, shows the credibility of said researcher. Sruly J Because a programmer is in charge of the politics of their country... But tell me; If someone from the US would have revealed these same facts, would you have an issue with it? Especially since they would be stating the same facts. EcE By that logic, all Americans are orange liars with tiny hands. Suicide_Note And some might say that whatever country you're from is the worst but, again, what would that have to do with Samsung's poor coding? marcusmarcus2 In that case, here is a link to 500 useless facts that have the same relevance to this article. You'll love it. http://alturl.com/p749b Shuli81 What's even more odd is that it's a paradise compared to whatever 3rd world country you live in Shane DeRidder More reasons to stick with Android proper, Samsung. Let the Android Developers do their thing as they do it so well. tim242 This has nothing to do with Android... EcE Exactly what he is saying... dump Tizen and stick to Android tim242 I don't think they will be dumping Android. It would be too much of a change for their userbase. But if they were to do that, I would surely dump them. The problem is, I don't care for any other Android manufacturer. HTC is not the proper ODM for Google, too many issues. Drunk Squirrel Did you even read what he said? He clearly said "dump TIZEN", "NOT Android"! Nicholas Conrad I don't think he really reads what anybody says. Drakenoid Which is why I blocked him ages ago and you should too. Middlefinger Yeah, because Android is so great. How many Nexus devices have rebooted randomly today i wonder? MJ That a thing? I don't recall my Nexus 7 which have had for three years ever randomly rebooting. I used a Nexus 5 actively for 2 1/2 years and remember a short period where I had to MANUALLY reboot it a couple of times a week. My Pixel XL has been stable and just as fast/smooth since day one. JohnyNoLegs Pixel XL here, required one RMA, 3 factory resets. Bluetooth is still dodgy. Google Play music is dodgy, it doesn't play for more than 30 mins without stopping audio. LOL at you thinking Google/Nexus?Pixel is any better LOLOLOLOLOL MJ OK, you had a bad phone. So? I have owned more than three Nexus/Pixel devices with no major issues. Regardless, I was responding specifically to the random rebooting issue the OP mentioned that I have never seen. JohnyNoLegs Nexus 5X random reboots. My wife RMA'd it within the first 6 months. 6P battery would die when it got to 30%, RMA'd that and the 6P i got, android system used loads of battery and I would barely get 1.5 hrs SOT even after factory resets. Then bought Note7, was leaps and bounds ahead of the Nexus 5X and 6P, except for the whole risk of exploding....THen I got the Pixel, which yea sure it's always fast at first, but it does so much less than the Note 7, and now my Pixel struggles at points anyway. I have owned every nexus except for the 6, I have also owned nearly all LG G series and Galaxy series. The most Issues I have had are with nexus devices, mostly to do with updates. Airoid Sammy is fu#ked Suicide_Note Hardly. It just means they'll be using Android for a good while longer. shadowx360 Samsung has at least matched (or surpassed) Apple in terms of design and manufacturing of hardware, but is Chinese-OEM level when it comes to software. Articles like these are why I stick with Pixel/Nexus devices. If they want to be taken seriously, they need to find competent software engineers - the GS8 announcement articles were shortly followed by articles showing you can beat the new facial recognition by using a flat photo. Suicide_Note To be fair, you can fool Google's facial recognition with a photo, too. OligarchyAmbulance To be fair, you can't unless you have a photo which blinks. Suicide_Note It's not at all hard to create a photo that 'blinks'. M. Luciano lol? for muggles? Ian Santopietro That actually blinks? No, that's impossible. But it's not hard to make a photo which tricks the software into thinking it blinked, which is why I assume that guy put 'blinks' in single-quotes. Suicide_Note You get it. Thank you. Carson Saldanha He's a wizard bruh Carson Saldanha Yes, that is "Smart Lock" and if I'm not mistaken, I think Google even put a warning of this. They also didn't advertise this as a "feature". Abhilash Bingi TBF Google also introduced the Face Unlock feature back in 2011 (with ICS and the Galaxy Nexus) which could be fooled by a photo. But it warned you that it's not completely safe and can be fooled by a photo when you tried to activate it. Joannaescott Google is paying $97 per hour!

Google likes to whip things up quick and throw spaghetti on the wall to see what sticks. There's lots of mistakes in that process. Also, Samsung specifically stated face unlock is not intended to be a secure locking method. They specifically said it's analogous to slide to unlock, so I don't understand why people are misunderstanding this as a "security flaw" when it's not. Justin That's why Google removed Face Unlock in Lollipop. Abhilash Bingi What? No. It just got renamed to 'Trusted face' and moved to Smart Lock along with 'Trusted places' location and 'Trusted Devices'. It's still an option on my Pixel. OligarchyAmbulance Same here. If this is how they treat their own OS, I have no hope for their version of Android. You're lucky if you even get a security patch from them. byteseyes Samsung's the only company out of all manufacturers that releases monthly security patches actually. Pretty awesome. OligarchyAmbulance No, Google does too. byteseyes I mentioned out of all manufacturers. Google's not a manufacturer. That's why I was pointing out that it makes Samsung special. OligarchyAmbulance The Pixel, Pixel C, Chromebook Pixel, Home, Chromecast, Chromecast Audio, Google WiFi, and Daydream would disagree with you. byteseyes Um, I thought it was quite obvious we're talking about phones, given that we're discussing Android and monthly security patches on smartphones. What does a laptop or a router have anything to do with smartphones? Besides, the Pixel phone was not manufactured by Google. Regardless, this doesn't change my original statement that Samsung is the only manufacturer that releases monthly security patches (for their smartphones, in case I wasn't explicit enough), and nobody considers Google a manufacturer, even with Google's nascent foray into the fringe hardware products you listed. In time, Google may become a manufacturer too. Who knows. OligarchyAmbulance "Google's not a manufacturer." "Um, I thought it was quite obvious we're talking about phones" Google is a manufacturer of many devices. That was the point. "Besides, the Pixel phone was not manufactured by Google" Right, and iPhones are made by Foxconn. So technically speaking, Apple has never updated an Apple device. byteseyes Um, you do realize you're arguing about absolutely nothing right now? I never denied Google updates their phone. I already knew Google updates their phone. I was stating that Samsung, a phone manufacturer, is the only OEM that releases monthly security patches, a direct contradiction to your initial statement "You're lucky if you even get a security patch from them." OligarchyAmbulance "Samsung, a phone manufacturer, is the only OEM that releases monthly security patches" They're the only OEM if you don't include another OEM. lol byteseyes Google's an OEM? Apple's OEM? That's news to everyone. tim242 Android's face unlock was the same. Besides, Samsung tells you that it is low security. You are just a nasty google sheep. EcE While I don't disagree, it's been 5 or 6 years. If Samsung was going to implement it, at least try harder. My guess is that it was a last minute addition due to the rumored onscreen fingerprint sensor they had to ditch. Shame-sung C.E.O Says the Current-C Shill who is a sheep to Swinesung now. Carson Saldanha Have I ever agreed on anything with you? tim242 I am not sure. But you should more often : ) Carson Saldanha -___________________________________________- Shame-sung C.E.O This has nothing to do with Apple. SWINESUNG is a huge dishonest,Corrupt,Horrible company who will be always known for stealing , profit, sued, settle. Speculation on what Apple is going to do = Nothing. The sad Truth is that Pathetic TIZEN Garbage OS will always be a Rip off iOS,Android & Windows and WebOS . Swinesung does nothing Original and does it half baked like all its product. FAIL FAIL FAIL. Peter World Citizen Your Korean boyfriend left you recently? ;) Shame-sung C.E.O why are you sharing what your mother told you? Kind of random LOL!! Defenestratus Google's software development isn't by any means stellar either. John Doe It is definitly more secure than Samsung and better designed. Google has a project zero team so find security flaws and it works great...I wonder why they haven't looked at Tizen OS lmao Zsolt V It's by not stellar you mean that it's the best out of all commercial companies you are right.... QwertyJuan To be fair... if you lose your phone, there is a HIGH chance that the person finding it has NO idea who you are, doesn't possess any pictures of you, thereby making the facial recognition feature a decent level of security. No... it won't stop your younger brother or one of your friends from "hacking" your phone when you are asleep. :) P.S. Samsung ALSO has a retina scanner built into the phone which is actually MORE secure than even a fingerprint scanner and for some reason we hear NOTHING about this feature. whispy_snippet It's less secure for the very reasons you just outlined. It's easier to get a photo of someone than their fingerprint. Drakenoid Not if you're a common thief, then it's easier to get their fingerprints off the phone than their pic. whispy_snippet I'm sceptical that a common thief has the tools and/or technical know-how to obtain and then exploit someone's finger print. It's not easy. Drakenoid True, but it's then also unlikely for them to get photo of the owner. My name is…. Oh yes, the classic douche that says "that's why i stick with Pixel/Nexus devices" Because Android was never full of holes or the Pixel deserves the iphone-like price tag. Zsolt V It's better than an iPhone, so why shouldn't it be priced so? Justin You know what's worse than GoPro Sheeps? Nexus Sheeps. YaKillaCJ Hold up now, while I agree that Samsung suck in the software department, I disagree with the Chinese OEM part. Let's not forget that Xiaomi has the best update record, even surpassing Google depending how ya look at it. Also OnePlus has been really good and ZTE not bad at all. Zsolt V What does update speed have anything to do with this topic? jodieisme Security patch..? Zsolt V So Samsung doesn't deliver timely monthly patches? mma173 Xiaomi is a way better than Google. MIUI has so many advantages over the other Android roms. But the one has to admit that they took their "inspiration" from Apple :) especially in the early days. Drakenoid True, I wish they would update the basic usability of MIUI to be more in line with Android, specially now that Android does a lot of things better. They don't have to serve Google's Android just an updated version with better design. I love their features though. Though Xiaomi doesn't provide security patches to Mi 5 as fast as they should. Zsolt V So you 3D print a face, no difference. Adam Truelove Agree, Stock Android managed by Google running on an S8 would be wonderful. Samsung makes great hardware, but absolute garbage software. JohnyNoLegs Samsung states it isn't secure man. SAM I had read about Tizen code and management and no wonder this article makes sense. Read what other programmers had to say abt tizen https://what.thedailywtf.com/topic/15687/code-review-malediction https://what.thedailywtf.com/topic/15001/enlightened Suicide_Note I view Tizen as being akin to the dark language of Mordor, and should never be spoken of. marcusmarcus2 What? Now you just made Tizen sound kinda cool. Jordan Palmer Well done. Bewear Die, T(ouchW)izen, die. YouNex That's why #NeverSamsung JohnyNoLegs Yea, go with some other small company that must have great developers and code review policies...LOL Audio This has always been my fear about tizen and why I can't buy the gear s3 watch, ESPECIALLY for using Samsung Pay. It also makes me wonder about Samsung Knox, tbh... Sruly J Isn't part of Knox incorporated into Android for Work? Audio Is it? I always assumed it was separate... Doesn't Knox pre-date Android for Work? Defenestratus Yes it is integrated into Android's Security apparatus and yes, it pre-dated Android for Work (which as far as I can tell is vaporware). saf1927 Android for Work is useful to use it as way to have multiple app profiles. There's an app on the Play Store that create a work profile you can manage yourself by adding apps, etc. LineOS for exynos! Call island Sruly J Don't remember the article, but this article says that part of Knox was incorporated into Android. http://www.zdnet.com/article/google-samsung-integrate-knox-into-android-eye-enterprise-gains/ Shame-sung C.E.O LMFAO!! For years i been saying the same-thing. TIZEN OS is just pure Trash. Swinesung has always had lower standards then free boostmobile phones and Software that should be on V-Tech phones at the least( no insult to V-tech). How ever we all know Swinesung is not Special and has never been special. It's just a Sheep Mentality. Good thing there is Nexus who gives you Amazing Hardware and Software not Bloatware and Half baked products like the ones Swinesung makes. Another Fail from Swinesung. Aaron Uh, you know Nexus isn't a thing anymore, right? Middlefinger Samsung probably spends so much time fixing Googles mess on Android for its devices that there is no time for Tizen.. tekfr33kn You mean f-ing up Android - Fix'd it for ya. Middlefinger How can they f it up when they make it actually work without causing the phone to reboot randomly. Thats an Android fault that affects a number of totally different devices, its not hardware, its Googles software, again. Googles UX is just getting old now, and while yes, Touchwiz was poor in places Grace UX is far superior to whatever the hell Google is doing. Its more logical, provides more information in a better way and is fully themeable. Adam Margeson Having owned the original Android device (HTC Dream), a Nexus 5 and a Pixel on top of several others, Google's devices tend to be the more stable ones in my experience. It's other OEMs like Sony, HTC and others that tend to have problems because of code they precariously stack on top of Android. I'm not saying that Samsung's is better or worse than others', but Stock Android has been fairly stable for me. As to "Google's UX is getting old now",.. As compared to what? Samsung's is really just a highly integrated theme on top of Google's UX. Sure, the settings are moved around, the quick settings look a little different, etc, but what about General "Android" is getting old? JohnyNoLegs My experience is the opposite. Having had RMA'd my Pixel XL twice, and had to Factory Reset a few more times, that's more than all my phone prior. Given the latest Bluetooth bugs and Google Play Music bugs, I think you are just floating on cloud 9 oblivious to reality. I have come from Samsung, LG and HTC. My Nexus 5x is a whole other story, it has been even worse haha Adam Margeson My normal vehicle doesn't have Bluetooth, but the rentals I used for several weeks during the time (2017 KIA Sonata, 2016 Ford F350 and 2016 Ford Taurus) that the bug was active didn't seem to have any issues - in fact, they were overly aggressive in trying to connect even when I didn't want it to. I also don't generally use Google Play Music. So, no, I haven't been on Cloud Nine, I just haven't had the same issues other people have. That said, I was hit by the audio-clipping-at-loud-volumes bug that was there for a couple months. That was mildly (/s) annoying. I only factory reset my Nexus 5 a handful of times over the 3.5 years that I used it, and that was more a matter of having far too many apps and background services running to the point that I just reset it rather than cleaning it up. I have read AP every day since I found the site back when the Galaxy Nexus was released, and I am well aware of the bugs other people have been having. I count myself lucky that I haven't been seen most of those bugs personally. Middlefinger None of it is 'stacked on top of stock'. Its a replacement for it, the stock code isnt there. Almost all OEM android is virtually a fork, and there is no reason why i cannot be better than Googles version. whispy_snippet This is the guy who labels people "Google shills". Middlefinger Who am I shilling for? Samsung because I have their phone, LG because I have their TV, or Microsoft because i have their Tablet? Maybe im just not happy with the state of Android at the moment.. Nah, i must be a paid Samsung troll obviously. whispy_snippet So? What's your point? I have a Surface, an LG TV and a Pixel. But everyone knows phones are the most important piece of tech a person owns which is why they generate such intense discussion. You seem like a huge Samsung "shill" and a massive hypocrite. Middlefinger Everyone knows that do they? Sure if you say so, maybe if you are 14. Funny ive been accused of being a shill for Google as well, so it seems to to depend on the bias of the accuser, namely, you. whispy_snippet You're kidding. So you disagree that the smartphone is the most important and innovative piece of consumer technology this century? Mate, what planet are you living on? Middlefinger I didnt say it wasnt (it was actually invented last century, but whatever). I said its not the most essential to everyone. whispy_snippet I didn't say it was invented this century, but whatever. The statement "everyone knows" was an unbelievably poor choice of words and I can't believe I actually wrote it. But my broader point that smartphones are the most important piece of consumer technology this century still stands. My other point, that you're a hypocrite, also still stands. whispy_snippet Oh yeah. For sure man. You got it. M. Luciano This makes sense. Samsung doesn't know mobile security. They have Knox, which they purchased and then had fixed by BlackBerry. We have notifications constantly about people's dryers and refrigerators being hacked, their TV's being hacked and the only way they get out of it on Android is because someone else is handling 90%+ of the legwork, ie. Google. JohnyNoLegs Knox is better than AOSP. M. Luciano I don't believe that at all, but even if true, the point was they didn't create that. JohnyNoLegs Why would that matter who created it? keithzg Because it speaks to their ability to write good, secure software, which is what's in question here. JohnyNoLegs Well they didn't write it, so then it should be great then by your logic. You are also ASSUMING, that all dev's/dev teams/products are done by the same people, which would be a huge assumption that is probably very wrong. Samsung didn't even code Tizen anyway. M. Luciano Because if they'd have built it, they'd probably understand something about security. But they bought it and then had BlackBerry improve it. JohnyNoLegs So thats a good thing right? ast00 At the end of the day, it's still Samsung. Not surprised. Rod Samsung and poor software? Not surprised. Marty What else is new? Samsung's not known for quality software. They've gotten better with Touch-Wiz, but that's their pinnacle. Peter World Citizen All compilers should just mark strcpy() as error. ;) bekifft Worse than this, Tizen runs on refrigerators, and all that other "smart" crap. People are connecting this junk to the internet and forgetting about it. This is the kind of stuff that causes problems like Mirai. JohnyNoLegs Linux runs on refrigerators, and all that other smart crap. Are you saying the devs that made all that smart crap did it better? Andy J So..... um...... anyone know what the SmartThings hubs run on then? Are we facing a potential situation where they could be hijacked. D13H4RD2L1V3 Here's something, though. Tizen technically isn't made by Samsung entirely. It's a project within the Linux Foundation and developed and overseen by the Tizen Association. As you'd expect, Samsung is a member, but so are other companies such as Huawei and Intel. Despite that, only Samsung has actually implemented the OS in their products. Given the shocking number of security holes, I can only assume that it was far from ready. Even though Samsung's Android skin is better than previous iterations, I don't particularly hold it in super-high regard because software has never been Samsung's forte. And I think they should make it so soon as their hardware gets better and better. Đức Thành I am not the least bit surprised, but that part about the legacy of Bada OS living on was particularly hilarious. mma173 Software industry especially OSs is a very specialized resource-intensive field. I wish Samsung should give up working on OSs to free up resources. ROB Can he also work on getting Nougat to the unlocked S7s ?

As a follow-up, the company is reportedly working on a next generation device that merges the two functionalities into a single product. Nintendo Switch The Information notes that the company is working on “a version of its Google Home intelligent speaker with built-in mesh Wi-Fi networking” to better compete with the Amazon Echo. This move would also helps differentiate its line of routers from the many similar Wi-Fi products available on the market. In itself, Assistant expanding to other IoT devices is not too surprising. Pricing is currently unknown, though there are several immediate questions regarding how it would be sold. Namely, the mesh networking component would require at least two devices in order to deliver the improved connectivity promised from the concept. As is, Google Wifi is sold in a pack of three for $299, while Home is significantly cheaper at $129. Would this next generation device be priced noticeably higher and include more than one unit right out of the box? Incidentally, Google recently began advertising Home in packs of two at a discounted price. All in all, such a merger makes sense and would streamline Google’s home product offering to just this future device and the Chromecast.

Chelsea have secured a massive win in their quest for the title! Eden Hazard’s double moves them 14 points clear of Manchester City and keeps them seven ahead of Tottenham with eight matches to go. They were so resilient. Stamford Bridge is rocking and it’s safe to say Chelsea have recovered from that defeat to Crystal Palace. As for City, they’re still fourth - but they’re only four points in front of Manchester United and Arsenal. That’s all from me for now. Thanks for emailing and reading. Bye. The Chelsea players, including Gary Cahill and N’Golo Kante - centre, celebrate their victory.

YouTube TV has some nifty features - and some big drawbacks by: ANICK JESDANUN, AP Technology Writer Updated: Apr 5, 2017 - 1:11 PM Twtter NEW YORK (AP) - YouTube TV, Google's new streaming package of about 40 television channels, is the tech industry's latest bid to get cable-shunning millennials to pay for live TV over the internet. It offers intriguing advantages over rivals, but it remains hobbled by a limited channel selection. Don't confuse the YouTube service, which debuts Wednesday, with Netflix, Amazon Prime and other streaming offerings. Like similar efforts from Sony, Dish and AT&T's DirecTV , YouTube TV primarily aims to let you channel surf over the internet, not to stream from an online library of shows and movies. So these internet-cable services can offer live programming, especially sports. But they also come with some serious drawbacks. While these services are typically cheaper than traditional cable or satellite services, people haven't been signing up in droves. Google is targeting viewers who have never subscribed to cable or satellite TV and are just as happy to get all their video from the internet; getting them to cough up $35 a month could be a hard sell. Google aims to lure subscribers with more sophisticated program search, personalized recommendations and a more fully featured online DVR than rival services offer. But it faces many of the limitations its rivals have. YouTube TV, for instance, features staples such as ESPN and major broadcast networks, but lacks key networks such as PBS, CNN and Comedy Central. And it will initially be only available in a handful of major U.S. cities because media rights are still stuck in the 20th century . ___ WHAT YOU GET ... AND WHAT YOU DON'T YouTube TV offers plenty of live sports, one of the chief reasons people stick with cable. Pick a team, and the service automatically records all the televised games it can find. Available channels include ESPN, Big Ten and sports networks from Comcast, Fox and CBS - but not Turner networks such as TBS and others that aired the bulk of March Madness. New York Mets fans won't get baseball games on SNY. YouTube also has the youth-oriented Freeform and CW networks; its rivals lack The CW. AMC is coming in a few weeks, so you'll have to wait to catch up on the just-ended season of "The Walking Dead." Since most channel numbers and names are meaningless in a digital world, YouTube TV arranges live channels by topic, starting with broadcast networks, sports, youth-oriented channels, then everything else. Subscriptions are initially limited to New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia and the San Francisco Bay Area - all locations where YouTube could get rights to local ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC stations. ___ SEARCH PARTY As you'd expect from Google, search is one of YouTube's big selling points. Its rivals already offer search by shows and sometimes by actors; YouTube adds topical searches, such as "aliens" or "road trips." Unfortunately, it's still a work in progress. A search for "nerd comedy" brings up "The Big Bang Theory," but "comedy about nerds" does not. And a search for "Modern Family episode on basketball" doesn't bring up the episode titled "Basketball." YouTube could also stand to take a cue from TiVo recorders and let you automatically record all programs featuring, say, Jennifer Lawrence, including her talk-show appearances. You can search for Jennifer Lawrence, but you need to go through the results and choose shows to record individually - too much work for a service that promises simplicity. One big plus: YouTube's unlimited DVR will store recordings for nine months, long enough for entire seasons of network shows. Sony's PlayStation Vue - the only similar service offering an unlimited online DVR - offers only 28 days of storage, nowhere near enough for binge-watching. YouTube TV works on phones, tablets and laptop browsers. Watching on an actual TV requires Google's Chromecast, an inexpensive streaming stick you control with your phone. (Early subscribers get one for free.) ___ ABOUT YOUR PRIVACY This being Google, your viewing and search histories might be mined for targeted advertising. You can suspend tracking in the settings, though that will hinder personalized recommendations. (It's too early to tell if that's a loss or not, though some of the early recommendations have been spot on.) You can share your subscription with five friends or relatives in your household, with three simultaneous streams allowed. No need to share passwords; they sign in with their own Google accounts. Recordings and recommendations are kept separate, so your roommates can't make fun of you for bingeing "The Real Housewives." Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

YouTube is launching a streaming TV service Wednesday. It's one of many — Sling, PlayStation Vue and local cable companies among them. But Google-owned YouTube TV offers several features the others don't. They include a cloud-based DVR with no storage limits, allowing users to record as many shows as they want for later playback. Membership also gives access to original series and movies featured on its other subscription streaming service, YouTube Red. And customers can create up to six accounts on one membership, with up to three streams running at once. A subscription costs $35 a month, with a free 30-day trial to start. The app can stream on phones, tablets or computers. After the first month's payment, YouTube offers a free Google Chromecast for users to stream the service to their TVs — as long as supplies last. Many of these details were revealed in late February when the company first announced the service, but no launch date was provided then. Every TV watcher knows there's still no perfect way to watch. Every service suffers from either high cost, limited offerings or restricted access. YouTube TV is no different: Initially, it offers about 40 channels to subscribers in five of the largest U.S. markets. Today, customers in New York, Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay Area, Chicago and Philadelphia can access the YouTube TV app, which will offer live streaming of networks such as ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox, along with cable channels like USA, Fox News, MSNBC and ESPN. Users can pay extra for add-on channels like Showtime and Fox Soccer Plus. The company plans to add channels from AMC Networks, including IFC, AMC, BBC America and Sundance TV. It also says it will add new cities to its service. Time Warner and Viacom channels like CNN, TNT, MTV, Comedy Central and HBO aren't included. And there's lots of competition at hand — Hulu is reportedly developing its own bundle of channels available by streaming, joining services already offered by DirecTV Now, Dish Network's Sling TV and PlayStation Vue. This rollout comes as YouTube struggles with an advertiser exodus since companies such as AT&T began to discover their marketing campaigns sometimes were displayed alongside videos with extremist or controversial content. YouTube's move still raises lots of questions. Will the many young viewers who watch YouTube videos actually consider paying for a streaming service to see more conventional TV? Can it help transform YouTube stars such as Tyler Oakley into more mainstream television celebrities? And how will YouTube TV compete with Hulu, which already has a large library of original content along with rights to stream shows on demand that have already aired on conventional TV outlets? Streaming services have had so many limitations that they seem more likely to appeal to consumers who don't watch much TV or to cord cutters who have already ended cable TV or satellite subscriptions.

The Information: Google plans to release a Google Home with mesh networking Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/05 10:03am PDTApr 5, 2017 28 Plus 1 on G+ 25 Share on Facebook 50 Share on Twitter Total Shares103 Google Google Home Google Wifi News Ever since the release of the first Chromecast, Google has been working hard to establish a place in your home. Last year's $129 Google Home was a major release, but it seems like Google isn't stopping there. According to a report from The Information, Google is working on an upgraded version of the Home to compete with the Amazon Echo. From "a person with knowledge of the project," the new product will be a Google Home with built-in Wi-Fi capabilities. Much like the Google WiFi, which was launched around the same time as the Home, it can act as a router and as part of a larger mesh network. This can probably be best described as Google WiFi with Assistant built-in. A person with knowledge of the project told The Information, "They want to have complete coverage of Wi-Fi in the house. Alphabet’s goal is to get more devices in the home that do more. Coverage of Wi-Fi is a huge pain point." I'm a bit skeptical. This new upgraded Home would definitely cost more than the existing model, and support for non-Google networks is unknown. I'm sure the Assistant functionality will work on any Wi-Fi network, but how will it work for networks not using a Google WiFi/new Home as the router? Hopefully we'll find out soon.

Instead of having 4 devices in my house, I could have two - and the cost should scale I'd imagine - maybe $200/device means $400 sunk cost vs. $520. Jimmy Roche So I bought the Google home and the Google onhub, so I'll buy the Google wifi home onhub thing so that I get +3 exp on Google play games when I use my Google pixel on my Google Chromecast over Google fiber FRKSUP #Invested Josh Phillips I have 3 Google Wifi pucks... I also have Google Homes in those same rooms. Makes way too much sense to come from Google, but I very much look forward to this. Chris Sanner I would've looked forward to this *before* I bought two google homes and the three-pack of wifis... OligarchyAmbulance Yeah this seems a bit ridiculous to come out with these after we've all already bought their routers and Home's separately. Morten Ulv I guess people won't need those things in the future. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Now you will be able to put one more google device in the same rooms James Briano Add a proprietary messaging app and I'm sold. Serge Cebrian why only one when they can make several! Suicide_Note Price this one at $129, cut the price of the regular Home to $89. JD No thanks Goog I'll guard my own perimeter thanks. Unless this Router has sticker packs! Ryan oh cool so it's what we all thought the OnHub was supposed to be with its built-in microphone. but now we have to buy both a new mesh system and more homes to replace the old ones. pass. MJ This makes a lot of sense and could save some people a little money. Now, how about a Google WiFi base with a four port switch for people that would like that? Not that it matters to me... I was interested in Google WiFi at one point but decided a router that someone else ultimately controls is just plain stupid. OhYeah! Google doesn't control the google wifi, it's the same as any other mesh network. Also you could just turn off wifi on your current router and hook the google wifi to that to have more lan ports and have googles mesh wifi. MJ Maybe using the word "control" was to strong but you did see this right? https://www.extremetech.com/electronics/245009-google-accidentally-resets-onhub-google-wifi-routers-server-error I don't need any hardware devices (beyond my phone) tried to my Google account. Suppose one doesn't have a working router already or prefers less devices laying around... Defenestratus Don't need it. I have a 3200sqft home and my Netgear R8500 reaches all corners of my home with signal strength enough to stream netflix just fine. I do need about 3 more Google homes though. Since they got it working with the Harmony hub its become even invaluable than just controlling my smartThings hub. Alec M router, modem, tv box, google home combo?? Paulo I wish they would focus on an unobtrusive and inexpensive assistant module with a decent speaker like the echo dot. Put one in every room that doesn't need high fidelity and my smart home is fully voice activated on the cheap. Integrate intercom capabilities and my dream is complete. The echo dots serve my home automation purposes for now but the knowledge graph is really lacking. Let's see if the Nvidia spot ever comes to fruition. Corbin Davenport Yeah, an Echo Dot with Google Assistant would be great. Defenestratus Still waiting on my 2017 SHIELD to get assistant. Corbin Davenport Tablets aren't getting Assistant. Brandon David Obert I think he is taking about the Shield TV kerrhome Add in z-wave and zigbee and we're all set. Corbin Davenport That would be great, actually. So now you just have a mega Google Home to replace your router, SmartThings Hub/other smarthome hub, and speaker. Serge Cebrian #ReplaceAllTheSmartThings!!! Gerardo Sarabia I thought that was the point of all this stuff when they started announcing it. To integrate it into one simple product. But then they made separate products and services that didn't really work together and instead competes with each other. I hope they get it right but seems kind of early for a Google Home upgrade. bekifft No this makes perfect sense based on Google's history. Google doesn't do crazy stuff like "one simple product". They make separate products, that compete. Then they drop support for them and do it all over again. Luxferro I'll never go back to consumer wifi/routers. DistortStatic Meaning? supersanborn Can't wait to see that it's priced greater than the sum of Google WiFi and Google Home. James Sarino I was thinking of getting a second OnHub to increase my range, and a second Home for use at another location in the house. If this revised Google Home/mesh comes out soon, that would be killing two birds with one stone for me! Simon Seems like they are stealing others ideas. This one looks much better. https://youtu.be/pufR8uJAAw0 Frawlz Oh great... now my wifi won't even listen to me. SHunter Cant we just build in Wifi Mesh Router, Smoke Alarm, CO2 detector, and google assistant into ONE device? Then mount it where you would put smoke detectors. (This would be a wired version, not battery) Jose Romero Next year they will unmerge it. JG IMHO, Google should have done this from the start. As I was plotting out how I wanted to set up my house, I noted that I was thinking of putting both a Home and WiFi in the same rooms (the living room and bedroom). These are the two rooms I spend the bulk of my time in when I'm at home. They're going to be where I want to be able to just call out queries to have answered and also where I want to have the best WiFi coverage. Sure, they're snazzy enough they can each be set out in the middle of the room (as opposed to standard "scary alien" looking routers with antennas sticking out of everywhere). But it's still, I only have so much shelf space in each room, and an even more limited number of outlets. Combining a Home and a WiFi into a single unit would save space, there would be less wires to get tangled and one less outlet would be consumed. And while it may cost more than the Home itself, it probably would cost less than a Home and WiFi unit bought separately... lgg4 Makes sense...I've wondered that as looking at our G WiFi and home sitting next to each other in our kitchen 4Ui812 After this is released whats next from Google ? Why it's Google home version 3 which will be released 2 years after version 2. And Google wouldn't be Google if they didn't remove something from that was useful in the previous iteration. Version 3 will lack a voice assistant because ..... Hey it's Google. That's reason enough. bekifft I hope along with this they announce a major upgrade of the existing Home's Assistant functionality. Starting to feel like I wasted my money Nicholas Conrad Don't forget, Home has pogo pins under a sticker on the bottom. Portable battery powered Home with charging base also inbound. Maybe the charging base doubles as the wifi puck. #MakesTOOMuchSense Ordeith All your data are belong to us. -Google Mike I Just a note. This home Assistant is supposed to conjure up the image of a cup of latte.

Rather than buy a bunch of new real estate and servers just for that purpose, the company embarked on a journey to create dedicated hardware for running machine- learning applications like voice recognition. The result was the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), a chip that is designed to accelerate the inference stage of deep neural networks. Google published a paper on Wednesday laying out the performance gains the company saw over comparable CPUs and GPUs, both in terms of raw power and the performance per watt of power consumed. A TPU was on average 15 to 30 times faster at the machine learning inference tasks tested than a comparable server-class Intel Haswell CPU or Nvidia K80 GPU. Importantly, the performance per watt of the TPU was 25 to 80 times better than what Google found with the CPU and GPU. Driving this sort of performance increase is important for Google, considering the company’s emphasis on building machine learning applications. The gains validate the company’s focus on building machine learning hardware at a time when it’s harder to get massive performance boosts from traditional silicon. This is more than just an academic exercise. Google has used TPUs in its data centers since 2015 and they’ve been put to use improving the performance of applications including translation and image recognition. The TPUs are particularly useful when it comes to energy efficiency, which is an important metric related to the cost of using hardware at massive scale. One of the other key metrics for Google’s purposes is latency, which is where the TPUs excel compared to other silicon options. Norm Jouppi, a distinguished hardware engineer at Google, said that machine learning systems need to respond quickly in order to provide a good user experience. “The point is, the internet takes time, so if you’re using an internet-based server, it takes time to get from your device to the cloud, it takes time to get back,” Jouppi said. “Networking and various things in the cloud — in the data center — they takes some time. So that doesn’t leave a lot of [time] if you want near-instantaneous responses.” Google tested the chips on six different neural network inference applications, representing 95 percent of all such applications in Google’s data centers. The applications tested include DeepMind AlphaGo, the system that defeated Lee Sedol at Go in a five-game match last year. The company tested the TPUs against hardware that was released around roughly the same time to try and get an apples-to-apples performance comparison. It's possible that newer hardware would at least narrow the performance gap. There’s still room for TPUs to improve, too. Using the GDDR5 memory that’s present in an Nvidia K80 GPU with the TPU should provide a performance improvement over the existing configuration that Google tested. According to the company’s research, the performance of several applications was constrained by memory bandwidth. Furthermore, the authors of Google’s paper claim that there’s room for additional software optimization to increase performance. The authors called out one of the tested convolutional neural network applications (referred to in the paper as CNN1) as a candidate. However, because of existing performance gains from the use of TPUs, it’s not clear if those optimizations will take place. While neural networks mimic the way neurons transmit information in humans, CNNs are modeled specifically on how the brain processes visual information. “As CNN1 currently runs more than 70 times faster on the TPU than the CPU, the CNN1 developers are already very happy, so it’s not clear whether or when such optimizations would be performed,” the authors wrote. TPUs are what’s known in chip lingo as an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). They’re custom silicon built for one task, with an instruction set hard-coded into the chip itself. Jouppi said that he wasn’t overly concerned by that, and pointed out that the TPUs are flexible enough to handle changes in machine learning models. “It’s not like it was designed for one model, and if someone comes up with a new model, we’d have to junk our chips or anything like that,” he said. Google isn’t the only company focused on using dedicated hardware for machine learning. Jouppi said that he knows of several startups working in the space, and Microsoft has deployed a fleet of field-programmable gate arrays in its data centers to accelerate networking and machine learning applications.

The Information said Wednesday that Google plans to add new mesh Wi-Fi networking features to Google Home, its smart Amazon Echo competitor, which would allow the product boost Wi-Fi signals around the home. The function would work similarly to Google Wifi, a stand-alone mesh networking package that replaces a single router and instead places access points that communicate with one another around the house and provides improved connectivity. Google says a single Google Wifi access point can cover a 1,500 square foot house, but that a package of three, which all work together as a seamless Wi-Fi network, can cover up to 4,500 square feet. If Alphabet does indeed build this sort of mesh networking technology into its Google Home product, then users could extend the range of their Wi-Fi networks without needing to buy additional Google Wifi access points. Google Wifi pucks retail for $129 each, the same price as a Google Home base station. The move could give Google Home an edge over the Amazon Echo, which doesn't offer the ability to extend Wi-Fi networks. The Information points to Amazon's investment in a Wi-Fi company named Luma as evidence that Amazon may be considering a similar approach, however. A Google spokesperson declined to comment.

In the age of RankBrain, these foundational SEO issues still matter Search engine technology has evolved, algorithms have become more advanced, and SEO tactics and strategies have changed in response. But columnist Nate Dame believes fundamentals will still move the needle. Nate Dame on April 5, 2017 at 11:50 am More There are at least 200 ranking factors in Google’s algorithm (not to mention RankBrain), which means a thorough SEO audit could lead to dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of SEO tasks. Few companies have the budget or resources to complete every potential SEO to-do item — and doing so would be an incredible waste of time and resources anyway. Some SEO tasks are critical and cannot be ignored; others just aren’t worth your time. Prioritizing an SEO task list is crucial. Focus your resources on SEO work that is actually going to improve rankings, increase clicks and drive revenue. Most companies should focus on engagement SEO work, but technical tasks can’t be ignored completely — especially if you have major problems. Critical technical SEO problems Audit any website for technical SEO issues — even the world’s top-performing sites — and I promise you will find dozens, if not hundreds of things that “should” be done. The list of technical SEO work can go on endlessly, if you let it. But what technical work will move the needle on organic rankings? Recently, my team conducted 15 audits of different web properties for a large tech company. The client was concerned that some unknown technical change or issue was severely limiting their organic search growth. Though we found dozens of technical SEO issues, most of our recommendations were for engagement SEO tasks. None of the technical issues we discovered were critical, and resolving them wouldn’t have provided noteworthy results. However, this thorough audit was still meaningful for the company — they were able to move past their unfounded concerns to focus on expanding content and improving user experience (UX) to drive higher rankings. Critical technical SEO issues are rare, but not nonexistent. No amount of engagement SEO work will be effective if a site has major technical issues, so it’s crucial to prioritize red-flag technical SEO issues above any engagement SEO tasks. Critical technical SEO issues include: Site speed. Google has said that site speed is a ranking factor, and study after study continues to show that faster sites rank better, get more engagement and close more business. Google’s own research shows that most mobile users abandon a site that takes longer than three seconds to load. Mobile performance. In addition to site speed, every other aspect of a site’s mobile performance is an important technical consideration as well. With mobile-first indexing right around the corner, mobile deserves its own discussion (see below). Blocked resources. If search engines can’t index or crawl your site, resolving this issue should be your first priority. Allowing site content to be indexed is one of the quickest ways to improve incoming organic traffic. Crawl issues may be caused by a few factors: an error in your robots.txt file, unintentional noindex tags in site meta data, or server issues that limit Googlebot’s crawl rate. Google penalties. Hacked sites, spam content and unnatural backlink profiles can all lead to severe ranking penalties. Sites with manual actions can be demoted in search results or removed altogether. If Google Search Console lists a manual action on your site, take steps immediately to resolve the issue — disavow low-quality links and delete hacked or spam pages — and submit your site for reconsideration. Significant URL and/or redirect problems. Did you launch a new site and forget to implement redirects? Perhaps that was two or three launches past, and those problems were never fully resolved? Is your site generating thousands of meaningless unique URLs? When URL and redirect problems reach a critical mass, they can pose a significant risk to your organic traffic. Other issues. Additional technical SEO issues — like fixing every single broken link and setting up redirects for every possible 404 imaginable — can also be critical at times, but these tasks fall into more of a gray area. If the issue is severe, fixing it is critical. If you have a handful (or even hundreds) of minor errors on a large site, and fixing them isn’t straightforward, you might be able to hold off. Always ask your SEO and technical teams to summarize the effort required for, and the anticipated impact of, SEO work. If the effort is quite large, and/or the anticipated impact is low — or it “may or may not actually help us” — then move on. Critical mobile SEO issues Mobile SEO is part technical and part engagement, and 100 percent critical. As Google prepares to roll out mobile-first indexing, optimizing your site for mobile is more important than ever. After resolving technical SEO issues, audit your site for major mobile red flags: Your site isn’t optimized for mobile. Mobile-friendliness is already a ranking factor for mobile search, and mobile-first indexing is about to make it important all around. Your site has to fit on a mobile screen, load fast enough for a mobile audience, and be free of mobile errors. Your content isn’t optimized for mobile. Transitioning your site to a mobile-friendly format is only the first step in improving mobile usability. The content itself needs to be designed for the mobile user. Make sure that buttons and links that are large enough for thumbs to tap, write content in shorter paragraphs, center-align images, and maybe even vertically align media. You use intrusive, annoying pop-ups. In January, 2017, Google enacted a penalty on sites that display intrusive interstitials over content. If you are among the many sites that display pop-ups or lightboxes over content on page load, it’s time to either remove that code or adjust it to display when users leave a page — not when they arrive. With critical technical and mobile tasks complete, your site’s framework will be set up for the tasks that will make the most meaningful impact over time: engagement SEO. Critical engagement SEO issues The most commonly recommended engagement SEO task is creating new, high-quality content. Adding quality content to your site is an important task, but when it comes to fixing a site’s SEO, optimizing existing content comes first. Red flags to look for when auditing a site’s current engagement SEO include: Lack of conversions. If content on your site doesn’t cater to your visitors’ intent, conversions will suffer. So the most critical engagement SEO task on your list should be reviewing existing content against keyword/user intent research. It’s possible that customers at the top of the purchasing funnel are finding content that caters to the bottom. They’re not converting because your content didn’t satisfy their needs. Low click-through rate (CTR) in spite of high rankings. If your CTR is low on pages with high rankings, it’s possible your competitors are stealing traffic with featured snippets. Featured snippets offer an opportunity to drive organic traffic by ranking in position “zero.” Perform a depersonalized search of your keywords and see if competitors appear in position zero. If so, prioritize optimizing existing content for featured snippets. Few organic social shares. If you’re struggling to earn shares of your content on social media, it’s likely that you have a content quality problem. Review your site’s existing content: is it unique and comprehensive? Are your headlines enticing? Take time to A/B test headlines, make sure that your content caters to users’ intents, rewrite fluff content, expand shallow content and experiment with different content formats. Lack of earned links. If other sites aren’t linking to yours, it’s another sign that you have either a content quality problem (refer to the advice above) or a PR problem. Sites can’t link to yours if they don’t know you exist. Take time to expand your efforts on social channels, guest blog for publications in your industry and build relationships with industry influencers. There are many important engagement SEO issues that should be high priority but are not necessarily critical. As an example, cleaning up duplicate content through redirects or the use of canonical tags should certainly be high priority, but it’s not necessarily critical, since there’s no ranking penalty associated with duplicate content. Critical reporting issues One commonly overlooked, yet critical, SEO task is ensuring analytics data is clean — and that it demonstrates impact on your company’s bottom line. Clean and meaningful analytics data allows you to gather crucial insights about your site’s performance in search, and to provide evidence of the ROI of your SEO efforts. In addition to rectifying critical engagement and technical SEO issues, take on the task of cleaning up your analytics reports: Ensure all site pages are tagged for analytics reporting. Filter known referral spammers from your reports. Set up custom views and goals. Align goals with bottom-line business metrics. Clean analytics data allows you to effectively track search results pages (SERPs), monitor bounce rates and measure click-through rates on important calls to action. Additionally, as you begin expanding your marketing initiatives to different channels, analytics will play an important role in highlighting what’s working, and what should be abandoned. The future of the buyer’s digital experience Technology is advancing rapidly, and buyer expectations and demands are evolving alongside these innovations. Today’s critical SEO priorities will be tomorrow’s outdated practices, because search engines are designed to cater to people, and people change. To that end, the most critical task for any SEO is to pay attention. Pay attention to your audience and their needs. Provide the information they’re looking for. Simplify their lives, and chase the monthly active user — repeat, loyal visitors — not just increased organic traffic.

Why the future is all about PASO — personal assistant search optimization Have you started considering voice search in your SEO strategy? Columnist John Lincoln explains why this should be top of mind for forward-thinking search marketers. John E Lincoln on April 5, 2017 at 1:17 pm More Personal assistants (PAs) aren’t just digital assistants that can be used to perform routine tasks. They’re also the future of SEO. Consider two of the most popular PAs: Siri and Google Assistant. People often use those assistants to retrieve information. And where do you think those PAs get that information from? Somewhere on the web. Here’s what you need to know about how PAs will shape the future of SEO, and why I’m calling this a new category, personal assistant search optimization (PASO). They’re on smartphones Personal digital assistants are great because they’re portable. The reason they’re portable is that they’re on smartphones (though they can also be in home devices, computers and any device connected to the “Internet of Things”). Siri, of course, has been part of the iOS smartphone platform for several years now. Likewise, Google Assistant is available on the Allo app, Google Pixel and other Android phones and Android Wear. Portable PAs give people the ability to use their assistants, hands-free, to get the information they need. That’s going to offer an irresistible level of convenience as we head into the third decade of the 21st century. Results are tailored to users Another reason that digital personal assistants represent the future of SEO is that search results are tailored to the needs of their users. That’s for two reasons. First, as we’ve seen, people often use PAs on a smartphone. That means results can be (and often will be) location-specific. Second, PAs are equipped with a bit of artificial intelligence (AI) to ensure that responses are in line with the expectations of their users. You can expect to see the quality of AI in digital personal assistants improve in the coming years. Fewer results on a PA search How many times have you Googled a phrase only to find out that there are something like 38 million results? Even people who have a lot of free time on their hands will find it difficult to sort through all of that information. By contrast, PAs typically return one to four results. That makes it easier for users to find the answers they’re looking for without scrolling through page after page after page in the search results. Here is an example from my own phone. I asked it, “Where to go skiing?” I get one result, as well as options to click “Search results,” “Aspen Colorado skiing” or “Send feedback.” As you can imagine, US News & World Report is going to get a ton of traffic from that listing. If you click the “search results” button, you get the normal Google search results page. If you click “Aspen Colorado skiing,” you get local results: This is why PASO is so important — with fewer results being presented to the searcher, the returns will be massive for those who are able to secure one of these limited spots. Personal assistant results likely have high click-through rates Here, we see an example of a personal assistant result for my company’s website, Ignite Visibility. The query here is, “How do I translate a YouTube video into a new language?” Just as in the example above, only one result is shown. Though there isn’t data on this currently, I suspect that in most cases, more users will click on the single search result provided by their digital personal assistant than on the other options at the bottom, especially as Google becomes better and better at honing their search results to provide the best answer to a user’s query. In addition, for queries with longer or more complex answers like this one shown above, the snippet returned does not always answer the entire question, and the user only has one place in front of them where they can learn more. According to our Google Search Console data, this page has a very high click-through rate (CTR) — in fact, it’s 187 percent above the CTR average for the website. It is worth noting here that this page also “ranks zero” — in other words, it has a featured snippet in regular Google results that displays above the first organic listing. It’s possible that the higher CTR reflects this featured snippet placement rather than digital PA result placement, but I suspect it’s a little of both. It will be interesting to see what develops as marketers research this further and obtain more data. Digital marketers should know where PAs get their information If you accept the premise that the future of SEO is all about PAs and personal assistant search optimization, then you should be asking yourself the following question: “Where do PAs get all their information?” It depends. It not only depends on the type of question that’s asked, but it also depends on the PA itself. Different PAs use different resources for information. Take Siri, for example. If you ask her a question that involves some kind of business transaction, you can expect that she might get her information from one of the following sources: OpenTable CitySearch Yelp Yahoo! Local ReserveTravel Of course, you would expect Siri to use OpenTable only if you’re interested in making a reservation at a restaurant. On the other hand, Siri would use ReserveTravel if you’re preparing for a trip. If you want to buy tickets to an upcoming event (such as a concert), Siri may use one of the following resources: Eventful StubHub LiveKick If you’re looking for information about movies, Siri may get information from the following sites: MovieTickets Rotten Tomatoes If you’re just asking Siri a question in an effort to get some information, she might use one or more of the following resources: Bing Answers Wolfram Alpha Evi It’s important to know where PAs get their information from, because that’s where you want your information to be located if you’re a digital marketer. For example, if you’re running a local business, and you want Siri to include your business name in an answer, be sure that your business is listed in Yelp. Likewise, look for other resources that PAs use, and be sure that your information is listed appropriately. That is why our company has invested so many hours in researching all the top data aggregators that personal assistants use. With this information, we can make sure clients are listed. As you can see, this has changed SEO altogether. It’s really a new form of optimization that many people are missing or ignoring. SEOs need to understand PASO There isn’t a whole lot written about PASO right now. Google either the acronym or the full phrase, personal assistant search optimization, and you won’t see too many relevant results. But that’s good news! Why? Because it means you can gain a competitive advantage as an early adopter of PASO. You’ll be one of the early websites optimizing your site for a search phrase before SEO has really caught on. For now, make sure that any site you’re optimizing appears in the portfolio of resources PAs use to get answers. Once you’ve done that, you’re well on your way to getting ahead of the competition. Good luck with this new chapter of online optimization. I’m excited about it. I think the returns will be big!

An Israeli security researcher takes a good look at Samsung's Tizen, labels it the worst code he has ever seen Jordan Palmer Follow View All Posts 2017/04/04 11:26am PDTApr 4, 2017 64 Plus 1 on G+ 276 Share on Facebook 74 Share on Twitter Total Shares414 News Samsung Android is a hulking beast as far as global user share is concerned — hell, it's the most-used operating system in the world, surpassing even Windows (in terms of internet usage). When Samsung announced that it was creating its own open-source alternative to Google's mobile OS, it was not really a surprise. We've had several upstarts over the years, like Sailfish, Firefox OS, Ubuntu Touch, and so on, but all of them have failed in some form or another. There were a few people, however, who thought Sammy could be the one to unseat Google and Android with a mobile operating system that it called Tizen. Whether it's pronounced TEE-zen or TIE-zen is still a mystery (Wikipedia and I say it's the latter), but up until now, word on the integrity and security of the code has been relatively scant. Israeli researcher Amihai Neiderman finally dove into Tizen's guts to see what he could find. According to his report to Motherboard, what he found wasn't good. Niederman claims that the operating system contains what "may be the worst code [he's] ever seen" with signs of amateur mistakes/practices and no less than 40 zero-day vulnerabilities. All of those 40 allow for remote-code execution, which permits nefarious parties to access and assume varying levels of control of a Tizen device. Remember, there are quite a few devices running Samsung's OS, including the Gear smartwatches and some phones. One of the most critical vulnerabilities was in the Tizen Store (the equivalent of the Play Store or App Store), which allowed Niederman to inject malicious code into his Samsung TV (also running Tizen). His conclusion from this was that you as a hypothetical third-party could "update a Tizen system with any malicious code you want." Even the store's authentication measures weren't enough — he just used a heap-overflow vulnerability (which he also discovered) to hijack the software before the security protocols activated. Moving on, Niederman says that Tizen's code base is quite outdated and even borrows some elements from Bada, its predecessor. However, he claims that most of the issues he found were in the new code, which was written in the last two years or so. Some of the mistakes are those one might find programmers making twenty years ago. As Motherboard puts it, this shows that Sammy lacks any basic code development or review practices. To prove his point, Niederman points to one example that he claims was everywhere in Tizen, strcpy(). Basically, strcpy() is a flawed function that is easily exploitable and is not used anymore because of that, yet it is supposedly prevalent in Tizen. To top everything off, Niederman says that the programmers failed to use SSL encryption in certain areas during specific data transmissions. This led him to conclude that they made the wrong assumptions on what needed to be encrypted and purposefully left out SSL in those places. When he initially reached out to Samsung to declare his findings, he was greeted with an automated response. Motherboard's attempts to contact the Korean conglomerate resulted only in the basic PR drivel about the company's focus on security and whatnot. However, after the original article got published, Sammy reached out again to Motherboard to claim that it was working with Niederman to resolve the issues, who corroborated this by saying he was in talks with the corporation. You can read more at the source link below if you're interested. Honestly, I can't say that I'm too surprised. As Mr. Niederman puts it, Samsung should reconsider deploying Tizen to its appliances and future phones before doing a serious overhaul on the code. I find that I agree with him.

(Sarcasm) JohnyNoLegs Lazy coding by coders....SHOCKER!!!! (Sarcasm because even google/apple has shitty code haha) F4LL0U7 But by all means, let's spend $900 on the new Galaxy phone, because I'm sure it's both immune to their terrible code, and totally worth the price tag. Ome Dries The S8 doesn't use Tizen though, so your phone should be safe... your Samsung powered fridge is a different story Leonardo Baez Or their line of smartwatch John Doe Yeah but they probably use the same programmers for Tizen and Android. kalehv I wouldn't think so. Tizen and Android are very very different inside out. demarcmj Probably not the same programmers, but the culture, processes, etc. are probably the same. Just this. the general attitude can't (and won't) be different MJ No... The Android and Tizen programmers are most certainly on different teams and only deal with their platform. This does not mean Samsung as a whole is good at software. John Doe We don't know if they really are on different teams unless Samsung told you. MJ I wouldn't know if Samsung employs cows for programmers unless they told me but I can almost guarantee the teams are separate. Programming teams at any company tend to specialize on ONE project at a time. It's not the same guys... There will be a small number of top programmers who will move from team to to team to fix problems or help with deadlines. John Doe "I can almost guarantee the teams are separate" No you can't unless you are an employee there and know what Samsung is doing. Samsung is not your typical silicon valley tech company so I have no idea how they work. MJ It's funny your whole argument is there is no way we can know how they do it at Samsung yet you had no problem making the statement the Android and Tizen programmers are probably the same which would be a totally unusual setup for any company with large programmer teams. Why not just go with they are probably cows which is why their software is so bad. LOL John Doe They probably are cows :) F4LL0U7 Right, but my point is that their code is crap, and they're making tons of "enhancements" to the Android OS, plus the dozens of Google apps they unnecessarily duplicate. Their terrible code makes a huge impact on the Android ecosystem. tim242 They don't unnecessarily duplicate anything. Samsung has many apps that are far superior to Google's bloatware. John Doe https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e46717cc007988df31954f458f30b8b237b2c4e803101752d08debfaa155bcf3.gif tim242 Samsung Pay>Android Pay Samsung Browser>Chrome John Doe Samsung pay is greater how exactly? And no on the browser I used Samsung's browser it is not as good as chrome. tim242 Ummm I can use Samsung Pay everywhere. As for the browser, you are full of shit. John Doe Umm that is hardware not software, Samsung bought looppay to do that and it has nothing to do with Samsung's software. Chrome is the most used browser in the world...facts. tim242 It is hardware and software, you know like Android Pay uses NFC. You aren't very smart. As for the browser, since when does most used equal best? McDonald's burgers are the most popular burgers, but nobody will claim them to be the best. Do better. John Doe Wow lmao. Looppay uses MST like your credit card so very little software is needed for it to work. You just need to store credit card information. with NFC there is more communications on both ends and more authentication is required. It is more secure than Magnetic strips. But at the end of the day when it comes to software Apple pay and Android Pay are much better (Design, speed, ease of use, etc) I have used Samsung's browser it is featureless. Chrome has a lot of features that I use and it is fast. I save my passwords in chrome, I have data saver, Read later, cached pages for quick reload, Google AMP, autofill is synced, better privacy controls and Do Not Track, Google translate embedded, and fine grain controls for sites accessing camera, microphone, notifications, etc. Samsung's browser is small potatoes compared to Chrome. AbbyZFresh If you've used Samsung's browser, then you would know it's speed >>>>> Chrome is well worth less features in the way John Doe Bitch please you are a bigger troll than Tim and you are a Google hater. Why are you even here? tim242 Your ignorance/stupidity is really showing. MST uses tokenization just the same as NFC. You should educate yourself before commenting about something you know nothing about. Samsung Pay is superior, deal with it. Samsung's browser is lighter, and has more features. You can log into sites with your fingerprint. Try that in Chrome. You can also use an ad blocker plugin. Try that in Chrome. Oh, and it is Chromium based. That means it has a lot of Chrome features as well. Do better John Doe What does tokenization have to do with using the app? We are comparing Samsung Pay with Android pay here and you said samsung pay is better because you can use it anywhere that has nothing to do with samsung pay dumbass that is looppay which samsung bought. It has nothing to do with the actual software. When it comes to the actual app the design, speed and ease of use of Android and Apple pay is better than samsung pay. Chrome still has a lot more features that the two you mentioned. But I can't change the mind of an ignorant troll. A troll is a troll is a troll. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/70cffa9c6cf517883f23a7ea527e30ffa7ecb7b3f6c82e8599d47b0b1cca584e.gif tim242 LoopPay does not exist. Samsung bought it and incorporated it into Samsung Pay, which makes it better than Android Pay. Tokenization means it is not insecure, as you claimed. You are the obvious troll. You make no sense at all. John Doe Looppay is a hardware feature it has very little to do with the app that is like saying I can use 3.5mm headphones with my music app compared to the iPhone. It is a hardware feature but the app at the end of the day is judged separate from that. You are truly fucken moron and deserve a note 7. tim242 LoopPay was the name of a company that no longer exists. MST was bought by Samsung and is part of Samsung Pay. Hardware can't work without software. Why you are trying to separate the two, is beyond me. Take the tech that Google bought from SoftCard/ISIS out of Android Pay, and see how far that NFC chip gets you. You are now on block, as your stupidity is too much for me. John Doe Samsung bought looppay and its patents so you can't have MST on other devices. We are comparing Samsung with Google here so you have to compare only the software not the harware (This whole fucken article is about software and samsung's incompetence). You are fucken retarted Softcard/ISIS was bought for Google wallet not Android pay and it was because carriers blocked Google wallet so Google bought softcard which was made by the carriers. Samsung pay sucks, period. "Samsung Pay's security measures are based on Samsung Knox and ARM TrustZone technologies; credit card information is stored in a secure token.[3] Payments must be authenticated using a fingerprint scan.[6][7] In August 2016, security researcher Salvador Mendoza disclosed a potential flaw with Samsung Pay, arguing that its security tokens were not sufficiently randomized and could become predictable. He also designed a handheld device that could be used to skim magnetic secure transmission tokens, and another which could spoof magnetic stripes on actual card readers using the token. Samsung responded to the report, stating that "If at any time there is a potential vulnerability, we will act promptly to investigate and resolve the issue".[8]" http://www.zdnet.com/article/flaw-in-samsung-pay-lets-hackers-wirelessly-skim-credit-cards/ Middlefinger Just because people are forced to use chrome on Android it doesnt mean its the best. Its the new IE, its terrible on mobile and hardly better on desktop. MJ Who are these people who are forced to use Chrome on Android? John Doe They are not forced to use it. Chrome doesn't come preloaded on desktop but it is still the number one because people go and download it. And it doesn't come preloaded on all Android phones. Middlefinger Yes, it is on every Android phone. If people chose Chrome over Firefox then thats their own problem and its not like FF is perfect either. John Doe It is not on every Android phone. And they choose it because they like it and want to use it. Middlefinger Its compulsory according to the Android licensing agreement, if you want Google play access. John Doe The play store is not on every Android phone...its not on any phone in china for example and the Mobile Application Distribution Agreement is optional and Google chrome is not even set to default and is hidden in a folder on Samsung devices so no one is forcing anyone to do anything here. Middlefinger Its on every phone that has access to the play store. What china does is not relevant to this so dont deflect. You know full well what i was referring to, not that it will stop you claiming victory as is usual on here. Its not hidden, its right on the damn home screen on international unlocked OEM devices. John Doe You said "*EVERY* android phone has Google Chrome". There are plenty of Android phones that do not sign that agreement and do not have the play store on them also the agreement is negotiated with Google including what apps to include. This agreement is also signed with carriers so Google, OEMs and the carriers negotiate it. And yes it is hidden in the US carrier version because I had to go through the app list, open the folder, click on it to use it and also have to make it default...it is not set to default. This was on an S7 edge. https://landing.google.com/intl/en/androidisforusers/faq.html https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-4a46Ko8RE Middlefinger Newsflash, the world doesnt revolve around US carriers.. On the first point.. well done, you won on a technicality that neither of us were even talking about anyway. John Doe That is where OEMs sell the majority of their phones through carriers and specifically US carriers not international unlocked phones which samsung doesn't even update on time (But that is another issue). But even in the international unlocked phone I am sure the S7 also does not have chrome as the default browser. Middlefinger My Samsung devices do, as did my LGs, HTCs and so on (including network branded ones). Some US carriers may have other things installed and set to default, but its the exception in the world. Either way Google requires its bloat be installed, and i dont see that as any better than Samsungs. John Doe You may think is bloat but the billions of Google users out there do not think so go download what you like. Shame-sung C.E.O Swinesung Pay is Garbage. Don't fall for this guys Sheep Mentallity. This is the same person who said CURRENT-C was going to be the winner out of Payment wars LOL!! No joke he was the biggest shill for Months. Shame-sung C.E.O https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d20aef0fbc504aadabb8bd8fde48166d56c8b76806fd4b9f3e699fb0f3c88c9a.jpg https://media.giphy.com/media/l3E6uhDAN3W7vylji/giphy.gif LMFAO!!! LineOS for exynos! I know Samsung browser is based on chromium... But he say 'better' becouse ad blocker... If chrome have ad blocker is will be faster.. that for sure Suicide_Note Two hardly qualifies as 'many apps'. tim242 That was just two examples. Another example is Messages. I have to use Samsung Messages, because Google forces pop up messages, unless you silence them altogether. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages all the time, but I'm not aware of any pop-up messages. Or are you referring to the way the message notification pops up? tim242 Yes, the notifications. Google took the option out of the settings to disable that nonsense. Samsung put the option into their app. Why is Google forcing that on us? It is annoying to have them interrupt what I am doing, and disregards privacy Suicide_Note I like it since i can see if i need to reply immediately or not, or just dismiss it to the notification tray, but to each their own. Good thing we have so many options to choose from. 😊 tim242 Yeah, I would use Google Messenger, if only I could disable that. Knowing Google, they may add that back later. JohnyNoLegs Google doesn't even have an audio recording app LOL. Google has barely anything. Literally BARE Middlefinger amung browser is superior to chrome. A carrier Pigeon is better than chrome, at least Samsung internet actually exits properly when you press the back button. John Doe So go use a carrier pigeon...troll LoL If you like Samsung and their programming skills go buy a Tizen phone Middlefinger I prefer Samsung to Google anyway. Android is a damn mess and getting worse again. Sure 7 is better than the total disaster that was kitkat, but its worse than anything since KK. John Doe Ok so go get a Tizen phone http://www.samsung.com/in/smartphones/samsung-z3/ Middlefinger I prefer Samsungs mods to Android to Googles 'stock', Samsung actually seem to test it before breaking everyone devices. John Doe That is because everyone's device is already broken (Laggy, buggy, slow, and filled with unnecessary apps). Middlefinger Like most of the Google apps, yeah you're right. John Doe Google's apps are updated continually and are stable than the majority of OEM apps since they are mostly updated by OTA instead of through the play store like all of Google's apps. Anyways, that doesn't change the fact that Samsung's software is laggy and terrible...it also gets worse over time which is just sad. And the fact that they take forever to update their phones does not help your argument. Middlefinger Firstly thats horseshit, Google apps are just as unstable as any. Secondly Samsungs launcher can be laggy, jsut like Googles can be painfully limited, so dont use either. The rest of the Samsung mods are better than Googles, especially the notification pulldown. Ive already addressed the update thing. If Google was pushing 7.1.1 to every device in the world there would be hundreds of millions that randomly rebooted. The OEMs test better and it takes time. Older thats stable and fixed is better than newer and broken. John Doe Firstly thats horseshit, Google apps are just as unstable as any. I use Google's apps daily and they are not unstable actually they are highly rated in the play store compared to samsung's apps and are used by way more people that just shows how stable they are. Unless you are using beta version, heck even the beta version is stable so I have no idea what you are talking about. There are always problems with updates even Apple has them with iOS but the difference is Google can push out a fix quickly like Apple. Also with new updates you get security patches and fixes for older bugs that take months to fix when going through OEMs and carriers. If you think Samsung's programming is good go check the article you are commenting on LoL. Middlefinger So what if google can and does patch things quickly, it shouldn't get broken in the first place. This just doesn't happen with most OEM devices, and hasnt to a single one ive ever had. My Nexus devices have been a string of bad hardware, poor software, show stopping faults and RMAs. John Doe I have had several nexus devices and pixel and I have never had severe problems to a point where I had to send it in. There are bugs like any other OEM especially samsung but Google has the ability to fix them quickly. Newflash, it does happen with a lot of OEMs including Apple. This isn't new anyways Google's software is highly praised on the pixel compared to Samsung's "horseshit". Go check the reviews. Middlefinger Im sure the 9 people that have a Pixel just loved the reboots. Nice its fixed, shame it ever happened. Never had severe problem eh? Ive never had ANY with anything except the Nexus'. Highly praised is it? By who exactly? If its the same people that bought the Nexus then they are easily pleased and highly biased. You cant deny there is an entire body of fanboys out there that love AOSP, regardless of how bad it is. If google just secretly used all Samsungs code for 8 it would be the best thing ever, because bias blinds. John Doe 9 people? classy. Nice joke. Never had severe problem eh? Ive never had ANY with anything except the Nexus'. You just lost all credibility just stop. All the tech blogs gave it excellent reviews and said it was the best Android phone available even tech blogs that favor Apple said so and that says a lot. Middlefinger Yeah, OK. Zero Mizukami What didnt you like about kitkat? I was always under the impression kitkat was more or less the pinnacle of Android Audio Totally disagree. There are no Samsung apps on my S7 that I actually use. tim242 That's you. I use Samsung Pay every day, to pay for everything. Samsung's browser is far superior to Chrome. I use Samsung's SMS app, because Google forces pop up messages on theirs. F4LL0U7 That's your opinion, and of course I have my own. It was just a little frustrating when I started my work GS7 for the first time and saw two of nearly every app. As a Nexus/Pixel guy, I'm horrified at Samsung's terrible (in my opinion) design and functionality standards. Not to mention the 3rd party garbage they toss in there too. I had to purchase an app that allows me to disable their default apps. When your first task in the process of setting up a new phone is to wade through and remove the bloat, there's something wrong there. tim242 I purchased a package disabler as well. But I also had to disable a lot of Google bloatware as well. John Doe You need to look up the term bloatware. Lookup, Microsoft office, facebook, and all the other unnecessary apps that don't need to be preinstalled are bloatware. Anyways I don't know what I am arguing with you samsung phones are burning up...literally so unless samsung sells 100+ million s8 they will always be behind apple. tim242 Behind apple haha you are silly. John Doe Why is that silly? They are behind Apple in the smartphone business. tim242 That is not true. Get educated, then comment. John Doe Lmao http://www.techtimes.com/articles/188124/20161208/apple-iphone-7-is-the-best-selling-smartphone-in-us-trumping-the-samsung-galaxy-s7-kantar.htm https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/56f89a4335e2c7fe807cdebf208e142c62b61a5cec127b30c1f4b3c96aee3961.gif tim242 Lmao that is just the S7. Samsung has many other smartphones. You are trying to move the goalposts. Try harder John Doe http://bgr.com/2017/02/03/apple-vs-samsung-sales-2016/ http://www.businessinsider.com/samsung-galaxy-apple-iphone-premium-market-share-chart-2016-12 https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/10/16/samsung-galaxy-vs-iphone-which-product-line-has-so.aspx Apple beat Samsung with 3 Phones....Samsung had 31. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/13806899d2dd953b00745e25586ce63bc99bfb72ae0d42ccd3bbb42fa9c618b5.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78dd8b407e1ea19bc331dea202aae34c0cb0772bea409ff56a11d2efb86e7f9d.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/91444a76a0ec89e25770a31b864244d9c04aad4f64e7c6152e993058b5c82bb9.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/688053d5bd7c128160ba9a9dfe79639b542955188e91c63913e08ee14faa1f85.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e9eb24fa3eae7253df33b2eb97d2250c7c498213eec6de868a759657891aad6b.png JohnyNoLegs Yea like Pixel Launcher, Hangouts, Daydream haha byteseyes Google apps are definitely bloatware. There's tons of Google bloatware I delete every time I get a new device with Android on it. Granted, I think Samsung and Google should get a pass for including their software because it's Samsung's hardware and part Samsung and part Google's software. Completely 3rd party companies like carriers or Microsoft stuffing their software is the worst kind of bloatware. John Doe Google apps are not bloatware because people do use them and they are useful. Bloatware means apps that people don't use and waste space on your device. Google's apps definitly do not waste space and the majority of them are used so no they are not bloatware. These are the apps Google requires most are Google play apps: Google Chrome Google Maps Google Drive YouTube Gmail Google+ (The only one I think is unnecessary) Google Play Music Google Play Movies Google Play Books Google Play Newsstand Google Play Games Google Photos Hangouts (Probably stopped requiring it already) byteseyes Your conclusion that Google apps are not bloatware rests on the premise that people use them. By the same token, Samsung apps are not bloatware because people do use them and they are useful. Realistically, I can count on 2 hands the number of people I've come across who use Google Play Music, Movies, Books, Newsstand, Games, Photos, Hangouts, and Google+. Most people I know do use YouTube and Maps the most, while Chrome is forced onto people often. Drive is a wash. That means almost all of Google's apps are not commonly used, hence waste space. So don't you think it's unfair and untrue to make the assumption that people use Google apps, while simultaneously making the unfair and untrue assumption that people don't use Samsung apps? I personally love Samsung apps and I find most of Google's apps redundant. I can understand if people are vice versa. Haha, sorry, I didn't mean this response to be too long, so all boiled down, Samsung and Google apps are either both bloatware or both not. Hope you can understand that they can not be different. John Doe Fact is that far more people use Google's apps than Samsung's you can check the play store reviews and how many people use them. Google's services are used way more often than Samsung's that is a known fact. Google and Samsung do not release numbers of every single app but Google has a billion+ monthly active users on some of their services. When it comes to the Google play apps, they come in a package with the play store. It makes no fucken sense to have a music section in the play store and no app to play it with. They are a package. Chrome is not "forced" on people. You need to lookup what that word means and Chrome is not even set as default on samsung devices so how the hell is it "forced"? That means almost all of Google's apps are not commonly used, hence waste space. It is silly to make a statement like that So don't you think it's unfair and untrue to make the assumption that people use Google apps, while simultaneously making the unfair and untrue assumption that people don't use Samsung apps? No because like stated above Google has more than billion+ active users on their services and highly rated apps in the play store and they a regularly updated. Samsung on the other hand has even discontinued multiple apps and services because no one is using them like Samsung milk music. https://play.google.com/store/apps/collection/search_results_cluster_apps?clp=ggEJCgdzYW1zdW5n:S:ANO1ljLMiXA https://play.google.com/store/apps/collection/search_results_cluster_apps?clp=ggEICgZnb29nbGU%3D:S:ANO1ljIY5oM Bloatware apps are determined by the user and I am positive that more users find Google's apps in a favorable light than Samsung's. You are in the minority. byteseyes "Fact is that far more people use Google's apps than Samsung's you can check the play store reviews and how many people use them. Google's services are used way more often than Samsung's that is a known fact. Google and Samsung do not release numbers of every single app but Google has a billion+ monthly active users on some of their services." YouTube and Maps are the most popular. The majority of Google apps are not used at all by most people. But that doesn't matter. The point is lots of people use Google apps, and lots of people use Samsung apps too. You can't ignore one group of people even if it's one order of magnitude smaller. It's still a significant number. "When it comes to the Google play apps, they come in a package with the play store. It makes no fucken sense to have a music section in the play store and no app to play it with. They are a package." Many people don't use them. I'm just using your own assumption and logic. I personally deleted them. Whether it makes sense or not to include them is irrelevant. Of course from a company's perspective it almost always makes sense to include their own service. That's business. You're inclined to make justifications for Google but not for others. "Chrome is not "forced" on people. You need to lookup what that word means and Chrome is not even set as default on samsung devices so how the hell is it "forced"?" It's not forced on Samsung devices thank god. But anyway, instead of on smartphones, I was just remembering off the top of my head about the Chrome browser slipping its way into many people's computers, so I was going off a tangent there. "It is silly to make a statement like that" It's pure logic. "No because like stated above Google has more than billion+ active users on their services and highly rated apps in the play store and they a regularly updated. Samsung on the other hand has even discontinued multiple apps and services because no one is using them like Samsung milk music." Again, that's not the case for almost all of Google's apps. Most of Google's apps are not commonly used. Google also discontinues or leaves as zombies apps that no one uses. "Bloatware apps are determined by the user" That's what I've been saying all along. "and I am positive that more users find Google's apps in a favorable light than Samsung's. You are in the minority." Of course a software-centric company is going to have a larger user base. I may be in the minority, but it's still a large number of people. We're not talking about 1 user vs 1 million. If there's 1 user, and an app is installed to cater to that one 1 user, then it would be bad to include the app. But many, many, many people use Samsung apps too. You can't cherry pick what you like and ignore everything that others like. John Doe Exactly so going back to my original comment that Google's apps are not bloatware and that apps from Facebook, Microsoft, and Lookout are bloatware. Also when Samsung has two music apps like Google play music and Milk on their devices and they end up discontinuing Milk because no one uses it that is also bloatware. So I am glad we cleared up your confusion on whether Google's apps are "definitly bloatware" https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/04d006e4bd2b9525b0b0e9550444617ee69614c33bf605ad372243dc9af02410.png byteseyes Logic must not be your strong suit. John Doe Good Job nice comeback byteseyes Thanks. byteseyes I can understand your viewpoint. Me personally, I find most of Google's apps redundant because I really love Samsung's apps. I actually did the same as you haha! I purchased an app to delete all of Google's apps except Youtube and Maps and a few of Samsung's too. I think there are people who use Samsung apps and people who use Google apps. Not referring to you, but some people like to think Google apps are not bloatware because they themselves use them. But many people also love and use Samsung apps, myself included. Even though I love Samsung apps, I can totally understand if people are vice versa. Logically speaking, either both Samsung and Google apps are both bloatware or both not. dabug91 Lol, umm Samsung has it's own calendar app, calculator app, memo app, messaging app, etc and they're all shit. No phone has more bloatware than a Samsung phone. They win hands-down in that category. tim242 I prefer all of those to Google's offerings. I'm glad to have a choice. OligarchyAmbulance You honestly think they have higher standards for their lagfest Android skin? tim242 They have higher standards than Google/HTC with the dumpster fire that is Pixel. John Doe https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a1405ef722a16da1e676294296d43a0d524eaaf5c53be0f4ec6d89b9ab035eb1.gif M. Luciano What? Where are you getting all this? tim242 There have been numerous hardware issues reported since release. Some of which being the microphone, speakers, camera, and the display. tekfr33kn I've had my Pixel for a few months now and haven't had a single one of those problems. I know that a few people have had them but it's more rare than you you are making it out to be. Audio Or for Knox for that matter! Bob http://imgur.com/gallery/UrhOtai Middlefinger No it uses Android, which we all know is perfect/ s ... At least Samsung fixes the mess Google creates most of time though. Jumanji! Are you perhaps conflating user experience with quality/security of code? A company can make something look pretty or function, but that doesn't mean there aren't any issues with the security of their code. Computer science isn't an exact science and creating software is always a series of trade offs. Middlefinger No im basing it on all the problem Google has with its own devices and how much time OEMs have to spend fixing Google code before they release it on their own devices. Jumanji! What do you expect? Android is a big, complex platform and there are a number of OEMs who blend it with their own, unique hardware variations and services. It's absolutely normal for customers to find defects in shipping products. It's ultimately how the company reacts to customer facing defects and issues that really matters. I'd love to see a list of the volume of defects that OEMs have fixed in the Android platform. I think data has the potential of strengthening your arguments rather than having them appear to be nothing but hyperbole. Middlefinger Not all fixes they make is committed back to stock. Much of what the OEMs do is proprietary, but given that OEM devices dont have the problems AOSP based devices do its reasonable to say they fixed something. If all the Google devices had identical hardware you could argue the problem is which specific hardware, but thats not the case. Regardless of the hardware the problem persists because the problems are in Googles code. Zsolt V You are right in everything you wrote. Congrats, finally a sane voice. F4LL0U7 If that was sincere and not sarcastic, thanks! JohnyNoLegs Haha doesn't run Tizen. Fail. Google code their own bugs anyway. F4LL0U7 No shit, try reading the rest of the thread. Vivek Rameses That's odd, some people think Israel is worst place humanity has ever seen. Sruly J Do you get a thrill connecting politics go something totally not related to that? Suicide_Note And that has to do with Samsung's poor coding......how, exactly? https://media.giphy.com/media/Qy9hRuWrKjY2I/giphy.gif Vivek Rameses Just pointing out facts. Sruly J Which are totally irrelevant to this topic. Vivek Rameses Shouldn't be in the title then. No, shows the credibility of said researcher. Sruly J Because a programmer is in charge of the politics of their country... But tell me; If someone from the US would have revealed these same facts, would you have an issue with it? Especially since they would be stating the same facts. EcE By that logic, all Americans are orange liars with tiny hands. Suicide_Note And some might say that whatever country you're from is the worst but, again, what would that have to do with Samsung's poor coding? marcusmarcus2 In that case, here is a link to 500 useless facts that have the same relevance to this article. You'll love it. http://alturl.com/p749b Shuli81 What's even more odd is that it's a paradise compared to whatever 3rd world country you live in Shane DeRidder More reasons to stick with Android proper, Samsung. Let the Android Developers do their thing as they do it so well. tim242 This has nothing to do with Android... EcE Exactly what he is saying... dump Tizen and stick to Android tim242 I don't think they will be dumping Android. It would be too much of a change for their userbase. But if they were to do that, I would surely dump them. The problem is, I don't care for any other Android manufacturer. HTC is not the proper ODM for Google, too many issues. Drunk Squirrel Did you even read what he said? He clearly said "dump TIZEN", "NOT Android"! Nicholas Conrad I don't think he really reads what anybody says. Drakenoid Which is why I blocked him ages ago and you should too. Middlefinger Yeah, because Android is so great. How many Nexus devices have rebooted randomly today i wonder? MJ That a thing? I don't recall my Nexus 7 which have had for three years ever randomly rebooting. I used a Nexus 5 actively for 2 1/2 years and remember a short period where I had to MANUALLY reboot it a couple of times a week. My Pixel XL has been stable and just as fast/smooth since day one. JohnyNoLegs Pixel XL here, required one RMA, 3 factory resets. Bluetooth is still dodgy. Google Play music is dodgy, it doesn't play for more than 30 mins without stopping audio. LOL at you thinking Google/Nexus?Pixel is any better LOLOLOLOLOL MJ OK, you had a bad phone. So? I have owned more than three Nexus/Pixel devices with no major issues. Regardless, I was responding specifically to the random rebooting issue the OP mentioned that I have never seen. JohnyNoLegs Nexus 5X random reboots. My wife RMA'd it within the first 6 months. 6P battery would die when it got to 30%, RMA'd that and the 6P i got, android system used loads of battery and I would barely get 1.5 hrs SOT even after factory resets. Then bought Note7, was leaps and bounds ahead of the Nexus 5X and 6P, except for the whole risk of exploding....THen I got the Pixel, which yea sure it's always fast at first, but it does so much less than the Note 7, and now my Pixel struggles at points anyway. I have owned every nexus except for the 6, I have also owned nearly all LG G series and Galaxy series. The most Issues I have had are with nexus devices, mostly to do with updates. Airoid Sammy is fu#ked Suicide_Note Hardly. It just means they'll be using Android for a good while longer. shadowx360 Samsung has at least matched (or surpassed) Apple in terms of design and manufacturing of hardware, but is Chinese-OEM level when it comes to software. Articles like these are why I stick with Pixel/Nexus devices. If they want to be taken seriously, they need to find competent software engineers - the GS8 announcement articles were shortly followed by articles showing you can beat the new facial recognition by using a flat photo. Suicide_Note To be fair, you can fool Google's facial recognition with a photo, too. OligarchyAmbulance To be fair, you can't unless you have a photo which blinks. Suicide_Note It's not at all hard to create a photo that 'blinks'. M. Luciano lol? for muggles? Ian Santopietro That actually blinks? No, that's impossible. But it's not hard to make a photo which tricks the software into thinking it blinked, which is why I assume that guy put 'blinks' in single-quotes. Suicide_Note You get it. Thank you. Carson Saldanha He's a wizard bruh Carson Saldanha Yes, that is "Smart Lock" and if I'm not mistaken, I think Google even put a warning of this. They also didn't advertise this as a "feature". Abhilash Bingi TBF Google also introduced the Face Unlock feature back in 2011 (with ICS and the Galaxy Nexus) which could be fooled by a photo. But it warned you that it's not completely safe and can be fooled by a photo when you tried to activate it. Joannaescott Google is paying $97 per hour!

Google likes to whip things up quick and throw spaghetti on the wall to see what sticks. There's lots of mistakes in that process. Also, Samsung specifically stated face unlock is not intended to be a secure locking method. They specifically said it's analogous to slide to unlock, so I don't understand why people are misunderstanding this as a "security flaw" when it's not. Justin That's why Google removed Face Unlock in Lollipop. Abhilash Bingi What? No. It just got renamed to 'Trusted face' and moved to Smart Lock along with 'Trusted places' location and 'Trusted Devices'. It's still an option on my Pixel. OligarchyAmbulance Same here. If this is how they treat their own OS, I have no hope for their version of Android. You're lucky if you even get a security patch from them. byteseyes Samsung's the only company out of all manufacturers that releases monthly security patches actually. Pretty awesome. OligarchyAmbulance No, Google does too. byteseyes I mentioned out of all manufacturers. Google's not a manufacturer. That's why I was pointing out that it makes Samsung special. OligarchyAmbulance The Pixel, Pixel C, Chromebook Pixel, Home, Chromecast, Chromecast Audio, Google WiFi, and Daydream would disagree with you. byteseyes Um, I thought it was quite obvious we're talking about phones, given that we're discussing Android and monthly security patches on smartphones. What does a laptop or a router have anything to do with smartphones? Besides, the Pixel phone was not manufactured by Google. Regardless, this doesn't change my original statement that Samsung is the only manufacturer that releases monthly security patches (for their smartphones, in case I wasn't explicit enough), and nobody considers Google a manufacturer, even with Google's nascent foray into the fringe hardware products you listed. In time, Google may become a manufacturer too. Who knows. OligarchyAmbulance "Google's not a manufacturer." "Um, I thought it was quite obvious we're talking about phones" Google is a manufacturer of many devices. That was the point. "Besides, the Pixel phone was not manufactured by Google" Right, and iPhones are made by Foxconn. So technically speaking, Apple has never updated an Apple device. byteseyes Um, you do realize you're arguing about absolutely nothing right now? I never denied Google updates their phone. I already knew Google updates their phone. I was stating that Samsung, a phone manufacturer, is the only OEM that releases monthly security patches, a direct contradiction to your initial statement "You're lucky if you even get a security patch from them." OligarchyAmbulance "Samsung, a phone manufacturer, is the only OEM that releases monthly security patches" They're the only OEM if you don't include another OEM. lol byteseyes Google's an OEM? Apple's OEM? That's news to everyone. tim242 Android's face unlock was the same. Besides, Samsung tells you that it is low security. You are just a nasty google sheep. EcE While I don't disagree, it's been 5 or 6 years. If Samsung was going to implement it, at least try harder. My guess is that it was a last minute addition due to the rumored onscreen fingerprint sensor they had to ditch. Shame-sung C.E.O Says the Current-C Shill who is a sheep to Swinesung now. Carson Saldanha Have I ever agreed on anything with you? tim242 I am not sure. But you should more often : ) Carson Saldanha -___________________________________________- Shame-sung C.E.O This has nothing to do with Apple. SWINESUNG is a huge dishonest,Corrupt,Horrible company who will be always known for stealing , profit, sued, settle. Speculation on what Apple is going to do = Nothing. The sad Truth is that Pathetic TIZEN Garbage OS will always be a Rip off iOS,Android & Windows and WebOS . Swinesung does nothing Original and does it half baked like all its product. FAIL FAIL FAIL. Peter World Citizen Your Korean boyfriend left you recently? ;) Shame-sung C.E.O why are you sharing what your mother told you? Kind of random LOL!! Defenestratus Google's software development isn't by any means stellar either. John Doe It is definitly more secure than Samsung and better designed. Google has a project zero team so find security flaws and it works great...I wonder why they haven't looked at Tizen OS lmao Zsolt V It's by not stellar you mean that it's the best out of all commercial companies you are right.... QwertyJuan To be fair... if you lose your phone, there is a HIGH chance that the person finding it has NO idea who you are, doesn't possess any pictures of you, thereby making the facial recognition feature a decent level of security. No... it won't stop your younger brother or one of your friends from "hacking" your phone when you are asleep. :) P.S. Samsung ALSO has a retina scanner built into the phone which is actually MORE secure than even a fingerprint scanner and for some reason we hear NOTHING about this feature. whispy_snippet It's less secure for the very reasons you just outlined. It's easier to get a photo of someone than their fingerprint. Drakenoid Not if you're a common thief, then it's easier to get their fingerprints off the phone than their pic. whispy_snippet I'm sceptical that a common thief has the tools and/or technical know-how to obtain and then exploit someone's finger print. It's not easy. Drakenoid True, but it's then also unlikely for them to get photo of the owner. My name is…. Oh yes, the classic douche that says "that's why i stick with Pixel/Nexus devices" Because Android was never full of holes or the Pixel deserves the iphone-like price tag. Zsolt V It's better than an iPhone, so why shouldn't it be priced so? Justin You know what's worse than GoPro Sheeps? Nexus Sheeps. YaKillaCJ Hold up now, while I agree that Samsung suck in the software department, I disagree with the Chinese OEM part. Let's not forget that Xiaomi has the best update record, even surpassing Google depending how ya look at it. Also OnePlus has been really good and ZTE not bad at all. Zsolt V What does update speed have anything to do with this topic? jodieisme Security patch..? Zsolt V So Samsung doesn't deliver timely monthly patches? mma173 Xiaomi is a way better than Google. MIUI has so many advantages over the other Android roms. But the one has to admit that they took their "inspiration" from Apple :) especially in the early days. Drakenoid True, I wish they would update the basic usability of MIUI to be more in line with Android, specially now that Android does a lot of things better. They don't have to serve Google's Android just an updated version with better design. I love their features though. Though Xiaomi doesn't provide security patches to Mi 5 as fast as they should. Zsolt V So you 3D print a face, no difference. Adam Truelove Agree, Stock Android managed by Google running on an S8 would be wonderful. Samsung makes great hardware, but absolute garbage software. JohnyNoLegs Samsung states it isn't secure man. SAM I had read about Tizen code and management and no wonder this article makes sense. Read what other programmers had to say abt tizen https://what.thedailywtf.com/topic/15687/code-review-malediction https://what.thedailywtf.com/topic/15001/enlightened Suicide_Note I view Tizen as being akin to the dark language of Mordor, and should never be spoken of. marcusmarcus2 What? Now you just made Tizen sound kinda cool. Jordan Palmer Well done. Bewear Die, T(ouchW)izen, die. YouNex That's why #NeverSamsung JohnyNoLegs Yea, go with some other small company that must have great developers and code review policies...LOL Audio This has always been my fear about tizen and why I can't buy the gear s3 watch, ESPECIALLY for using Samsung Pay. It also makes me wonder about Samsung Knox, tbh... Sruly J Isn't part of Knox incorporated into Android for Work? Audio Is it? I always assumed it was separate... Doesn't Knox pre-date Android for Work? Defenestratus Yes it is integrated into Android's Security apparatus and yes, it pre-dated Android for Work (which as far as I can tell is vaporware). saf1927 Android for Work is useful to use it as way to have multiple app profiles. There's an app on the Play Store that create a work profile you can manage yourself by adding apps, etc. LineOS for exynos! Call island Sruly J Don't remember the article, but this article says that part of Knox was incorporated into Android. http://www.zdnet.com/article/google-samsung-integrate-knox-into-android-eye-enterprise-gains/ Shame-sung C.E.O LMFAO!! For years i been saying the same-thing. TIZEN OS is just pure Trash. Swinesung has always had lower standards then free boostmobile phones and Software that should be on V-Tech phones at the least( no insult to V-tech). How ever we all know Swinesung is not Special and has never been special. It's just a Sheep Mentality. Good thing there is Nexus who gives you Amazing Hardware and Software not Bloatware and Half baked products like the ones Swinesung makes. Another Fail from Swinesung. Aaron Uh, you know Nexus isn't a thing anymore, right? Middlefinger Samsung probably spends so much time fixing Googles mess on Android for its devices that there is no time for Tizen.. tekfr33kn You mean f-ing up Android - Fix'd it for ya. Middlefinger How can they f it up when they make it actually work without causing the phone to reboot randomly. Thats an Android fault that affects a number of totally different devices, its not hardware, its Googles software, again. Googles UX is just getting old now, and while yes, Touchwiz was poor in places Grace UX is far superior to whatever the hell Google is doing. Its more logical, provides more information in a better way and is fully themeable. Adam Margeson Having owned the original Android device (HTC Dream), a Nexus 5 and a Pixel on top of several others, Google's devices tend to be the more stable ones in my experience. It's other OEMs like Sony, HTC and others that tend to have problems because of code they precariously stack on top of Android. I'm not saying that Samsung's is better or worse than others', but Stock Android has been fairly stable for me. As to "Google's UX is getting old now",.. As compared to what? Samsung's is really just a highly integrated theme on top of Google's UX. Sure, the settings are moved around, the quick settings look a little different, etc, but what about General "Android" is getting old? JohnyNoLegs My experience is the opposite. Having had RMA'd my Pixel XL twice, and had to Factory Reset a few more times, that's more than all my phone prior. Given the latest Bluetooth bugs and Google Play Music bugs, I think you are just floating on cloud 9 oblivious to reality. I have come from Samsung, LG and HTC. My Nexus 5x is a whole other story, it has been even worse haha Adam Margeson My normal vehicle doesn't have Bluetooth, but the rentals I used for several weeks during the time (2017 KIA Sonata, 2016 Ford F350 and 2016 Ford Taurus) that the bug was active didn't seem to have any issues - in fact, they were overly aggressive in trying to connect even when I didn't want it to. I also don't generally use Google Play Music. So, no, I haven't been on Cloud Nine, I just haven't had the same issues other people have. That said, I was hit by the audio-clipping-at-loud-volumes bug that was there for a couple months. That was mildly (/s) annoying. I only factory reset my Nexus 5 a handful of times over the 3.5 years that I used it, and that was more a matter of having far too many apps and background services running to the point that I just reset it rather than cleaning it up. I have read AP every day since I found the site back when the Galaxy Nexus was released, and I am well aware of the bugs other people have been having. I count myself lucky that I haven't been seen most of those bugs personally. Middlefinger None of it is 'stacked on top of stock'. Its a replacement for it, the stock code isnt there. Almost all OEM android is virtually a fork, and there is no reason why i cannot be better than Googles version. whispy_snippet This is the guy who labels people "Google shills". Middlefinger Who am I shilling for? Samsung because I have their phone, LG because I have their TV, or Microsoft because i have their Tablet? Maybe im just not happy with the state of Android at the moment.. Nah, i must be a paid Samsung troll obviously. whispy_snippet So? What's your point? I have a Surface, an LG TV and a Pixel. But everyone knows phones are the most important piece of tech a person owns which is why they generate such intense discussion. You seem like a huge Samsung "shill" and a massive hypocrite. Middlefinger Everyone knows that do they? Sure if you say so, maybe if you are 14. Funny ive been accused of being a shill for Google as well, so it seems to to depend on the bias of the accuser, namely, you. whispy_snippet You're kidding. So you disagree that the smartphone is the most important and innovative piece of consumer technology this century? Mate, what planet are you living on? Middlefinger I didnt say it wasnt (it was actually invented last century, but whatever). I said its not the most essential to everyone. whispy_snippet I didn't say it was invented this century, but whatever. The statement "everyone knows" was an unbelievably poor choice of words and I can't believe I actually wrote it. But my broader point that smartphones are the most important piece of consumer technology this century still stands. My other point, that you're a hypocrite, also still stands. whispy_snippet Oh yeah. For sure man. You got it. M. Luciano This makes sense. Samsung doesn't know mobile security. They have Knox, which they purchased and then had fixed by BlackBerry. We have notifications constantly about people's dryers and refrigerators being hacked, their TV's being hacked and the only way they get out of it on Android is because someone else is handling 90%+ of the legwork, ie. Google. JohnyNoLegs Knox is better than AOSP. M. Luciano I don't believe that at all, but even if true, the point was they didn't create that. JohnyNoLegs Why would that matter who created it? keithzg Because it speaks to their ability to write good, secure software, which is what's in question here. JohnyNoLegs Well they didn't write it, so then it should be great then by your logic. You are also ASSUMING, that all dev's/dev teams/products are done by the same people, which would be a huge assumption that is probably very wrong. Samsung didn't even code Tizen anyway. M. Luciano Because if they'd have built it, they'd probably understand something about security. But they bought it and then had BlackBerry improve it. JohnyNoLegs So thats a good thing right? ast00 At the end of the day, it's still Samsung. Not surprised. Rod Samsung and poor software? Not surprised. Marty What else is new? Samsung's not known for quality software. They've gotten better with Touch-Wiz, but that's their pinnacle. Peter World Citizen All compilers should just mark strcpy() as error. ;) bekifft Worse than this, Tizen runs on refrigerators, and all that other "smart" crap. People are connecting this junk to the internet and forgetting about it. This is the kind of stuff that causes problems like Mirai. JohnyNoLegs Linux runs on refrigerators, and all that other smart crap. Are you saying the devs that made all that smart crap did it better? Andy J So..... um...... anyone know what the SmartThings hubs run on then? Are we facing a potential situation where they could be hijacked. D13H4RD2L1V3 Here's something, though. Tizen technically isn't made by Samsung entirely. It's a project within the Linux Foundation and developed and overseen by the Tizen Association. As you'd expect, Samsung is a member, but so are other companies such as Huawei and Intel. Despite that, only Samsung has actually implemented the OS in their products. Given the shocking number of security holes, I can only assume that it was far from ready. Even though Samsung's Android skin is better than previous iterations, I don't particularly hold it in super-high regard because software has never been Samsung's forte. And I think they should make it so soon as their hardware gets better and better. Đức Thành I am not the least bit surprised, but that part about the legacy of Bada OS living on was particularly hilarious. mma173 Software industry especially OSs is a very specialized resource-intensive field. I wish Samsung should give up working on OSs to free up resources. ROB Can he also work on getting Nougat to the unlocked S7s ?

Google (GOOG, GOOGL) on Wednesday announced that the world’s largest video sharing website is getting a live TV streaming service that will let you watch 40 channels at launch, including the five major broadcast stations, with more coming in the future. The $35 per month service, which launches in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco Bay Area, Chicago and Philadelphia with other regions to follow, will let you stream ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC and the CW. That’s a coup for Google, as competing services like Dish’s (DISH) Sling TV and Sony’s (SNE) PlayStation Vue either offer only some of or none of those broadcasters. Outside of those channels, you’ll get Fox Sports and its FS1 and FS2 affiliates, ESPN and its various offshoots, CBS and NBC’s sports channels … you know what, let’s just say there are a bunch of sports networks. There’s also Syfy, Bravo, FX and FXX, E, Disney Channel, Fox News, MSNBC and CNBC and a slew of others. View photos YouTube TV is launching with 40 channels, but will add more in the coming future.More Google says it’s also adding AMC, BBC America, IFC, Sundance, We tv and BBC World News in the near future. You’ll also have the option to add on Showtime and other channels for an added fee. You’ll get access to YouTube Red Originals as part of the standard package. Interestingly, Google doesn’t make any mention of adding HBO to the mix. YouTube TV will include six user accounts, as well as a cloud-based DVR with unlimited storage. Which means you can save every episode of “Big Bang Theory” for when you have guests over and want a not-so-subtle way of chasing them out at the end of the night. Beyond TV Naturally, you’ll be able to stream YouTube TV through your browser on your desktop or laptop, as well as your smartphone or tablet. Google is also throwing in a free Chromecast after your first monthly payment, so you’ll be able to stream your shows to your big-screen TV when you want to relax on the couch and not have to hold your phone or laptop. With its $35 price tag, Google immediately undercuts Sony’s PlayStation Vue, which starts at $39 per month. Sony’s offering, however, gets you more than 45 channels for that extra $4. Sling TV, meanwhile, starts at $20 per month for 30 channels, but gives you 45 if you jump to the $25 option. Still, with its brand recognition and Google’s massive reach, YouTube TV could put a hurting on Vue and Sling TV. Naturally, I’m taking it upon myself to test YouTube TV for you, dear reader, by locking myself in an office for the rest of the day and watching TV. The sacrifices I make for you people.

In short, the supply/demand market Facebook has established was very transparent, and advertisers (not to mention publishers) loved it. Google had largely refused to move into that era of internet advertising. Source: Shutterstock Now GOOGL stock holders have another headwind to deal with. As it turns out, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) — which was already helping Facebook with its new ad-sales product — is getting a surprising amount of traction with its own search engine. This, of course, lays the groundwork for an increasing degree of advertising dollars devoted to the e-commerce giant, and diverted away from Google. The same as before, Alphabet really needs to step up its game and do business like it’s 2017 rather than 2007. Everybody else is. Amazon Takes Aim at Alphabet Calling a spade a spade, NYU Stern School of Business professor Scott Galloway may have been speaking more for effect than for accuracy when he told CNBC on Tuesday that Amazon could soon be a “more important search engine than Google.” But, his point was well taken all the same. He points out that while Google still draws a search engine crowd, many of those consumers aren’t apt to be shoppers. A consumer who visits Amazon.com, though, has already self-identified as a likely buyer. Amazon is now leveraging the nuance of this relationship with web users. Put this term in your Lexicon, particularly if you’re a fan of Amazon (or if you’re worried about your GOOGL stock position). — “sponsored goods.” It’s exactly what it sounds like. That is, goods that Amazon does a little better job of featuring on and off its website for a bit of extra nosh from the seller providing the item. It’s happening now, and perhaps a little more than most internet shoppers may even realize. Analysts are taking notice too. BMO Capital Markets analyst Daniel Salmon sees enough opportunity ahead to make a point of commenting on Amazon’s new-found focus. He explained: “A key point of differentiation for Amazon [from competitors] is the massive amount of consumer purchase data it possesses,” Salmon said in the note to clients covered by Yahoo Finance. “While Google knows what people are searching for and Facebook knows what people are interested in and who they are connected to, Amazon knows the specific products that customers are purchasing and how frequently they are purchasing these products.” He went on to downgrade GOOGL stock from “outperform” to “market perform” due to Amazon’s increasingly impressive move into Google’s turf.

Internet Law and Ethics Professor, Communications Department Adelphi University, Garden City, N.Y. „There’s lots of misinformation about this — although it’s still not good news. In short, nothing is changing. You didn’t have online privacy to begin with, so you’re not losing anything. The FCC had recently adopted new privacy rules that were set to go into place, but the new legislation stops that from happening. No, someone can’t buy your specific internet history. That’s a myth. A VPN won’t entirely shield your privacy, either – that’s another myth. What’s going to happen is you’re going to see more and more targeted ads when you surf online. So, for example, if your kid’s teacher emails you that he’s struggling in algebra, you might see ads about tutoring services. If you do a Google search for flights to Paris, expect to see ads from airlines and hotel websites. Deregulation of internet service providers has been a disaster for Americans. ISPs haven’t delivered the promises they made when they begged Congress to end common carriage regulations in the ’90s. Twenty years later, we’ve gone from being a pioneer in internet service to now lagging behind developing countries in terms of access, cost, speed, privacy protections and more. And this situation will probably continue to get worse. It looks like net neutrality is next on the chopping block.” Website: http://www.adelphi.edu Contact: Kali Chan, chan@adelphi.edu How Lawsuits May Be the Ultimate Unraveling of the Trump Presidency James Goodnow Legal & Political Commentator Fennemore Craig „Allegations about Trump and sexual misconduct are in the news again. This time it’s because Summer Zervos, a former ‚Apprentice’ contestant who alleged Trump made improper advances, is suing Trump for defamation. This week, Trump’s lawyers indicated they will seek to have Zervos’ claim dismissed because they claim Trump is immunized from state court suits because he is president. Will Trump’s argument carry the day? Probably not. In 1997, the United States Supreme Court held unanimously in Clinton v. Jones that Bill Clinton could be sued while in office for acts allegedly committed before he assumed office. The case related to allegations of sexual harassment from former Arkansas state employee Paula Jones. In the case, the Supreme Court rejected Clinton’s claims that he was immune, noting: ‚The separation-of-powers doctrine does not require federal courts to stay all private actions against the President until he leaves office.’ So why is Trump challenging this seemingly clear case?” ProfNet Profile: http://www.profnetconnect.com/james.goodnow Bio: https://lambergoodnow.com/legalcommentator/ Contact: Terence J. Murnin, tmurnin@fclaw.com How the Gorsuch Vote on Friday May Change the Supreme Court Forever James Goodnow Legal & Political Commentator Fennemore Craig, Phoenix „This Friday, April 7, is shaping up to be a huge day in our country’s history, and to borrow a line from Senator Mitch McConnell, whether or not Judge Gorsuch gets his new robes ‚really depends on our Democratic friends.’ How will this week unfold? Going nuclear? Three Democratic Senators have indicated they will break party ranks and support President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch and oppose filibuster — nearly half the number needed to avoid the ‚nuclear option,’ the changing of the Senate rules to allow confirmation by a simple majority. With Republicans having a 52-48 edge in the Senate, the question is whether Senate Majority Leader McConnell can woo the five additional votes needed to get to 60. Based on the current landscape, it’s not looking good. Democrats now have enough votes to filibuster the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court.” ProfNet Profile: http://www.profnetconnect.com/james.goodnow Bio: https://lambergoodnow.com/legalcommentator/ Contact: Terence J. Murnin, tmurnin@fclaw.com UK’s Process of Withdrawal From European Union Raj Bhala Associate Dean for International & Comparative Law; Rice Distinguished Professor, School of Law University of Kansas Bhala can discuss the triggering of Article 50, which officially begins the UK’s process of withdrawal from the European Union (Brexit), and international trade and political negotiations now set to take place: „The United Kingdom is about to embark on the most complex set of negotiations it has encountered since the era of decolonization, when it withdrew from countries across the British Empire. Unlike that era, which spanned several decades, now the UK has limited time: two years. Also unlike that era, the UK is dealing with the entire world – that is, the other 163 members of the World Trade Organization. Finally, its previous colonial withdrawal did not threaten the integrity of the UK itself. Now, its future as a ‚United’ Kingdom is in peril. For America, the ramifications with its closest ally, its special relationship, cover economic, political, military and national security matters. For Americans, a pillar of their post-Second World War, post-Cold War world is changing.” Bhala has authored dozens of journal articles and books, including „TPP Objectively: Law, Economics, and National Security of History’s Largest, Longest Free Trade Agreement,” „Understanding Islamic Law (Shari’a),” „Modern GATT Law” and „International Trade Law: An Interdisciplinary, Non-Western Textbook.” Contact: Mike Krings, mkrings@ku.edu YouTube Advertisers Boycott Robert J. Zafft Privacy and Technology Attorney, Greensfelder, Hemker & Gale, P.C. (St. Louis) Business Ethics Teacher, Washington University in St. Louis „The suspension of their advertising on YouTube by blue-chip brands like PepsiCo, Johnson & Johnson, Walmart and Starbucks due to concern over automated ad placements reflects a maturing of social media and society. Current YouTube technology cannot adequately screen the content, and the brands worry that automated ad placements will pair their brands with content that promotes terrorism, racism, violence, or other messages highly offensive to customers. For a long time, publishers have acted like hotel owners who happily collect rent while turning a blind eye to unsavory or illegal goings on in the rooms they let. Now, the advertisers who foot the bill have begun to say, ‚That’s no longer good enough.’ And it’s not just the problem of YouTube owner Google, which has vowed to address the issue. Brand risk will likely move down the food chain, affecting other publishers, ad networks and ad buyers. Social media will likely get faster and more effective at naming and shaming businesses involved.” Zafft is able to discuss the ethics surrounding this matter, as well as a possible solution involving „collaborative filtering,” as a collective response to the problem: „Collaborative filtering would assess content by looking at who posts it and who watches it. Collaborative filtering improves with the number of companies and publishers that participate. If top publishers and ad networks wire into the same filtering system, they can say to ad buyers and consumers, ‚Our system may not be perfect, but it’s the best there is, and we are working hard with others to improve it.’ This answer may go a long way to diminishing or defusing brand risk.” Contact: Randy Labuzinski, rlabuzinski@jaffepr.com EXPERT ROUNDUP: Trump’s Environmental Policy (16 experts) With President Trump signing a sweeping executive order that rescinds at least six Obama-era executive orders aimed at curbing climate change and regulating carbon emissions, following are experts who are available for interviews on President Trump’s environmental policy: Climate Change and Ideology Lawrence Hamilton Professor of Sociology University of New Hampshire Hamilton’s recent research (see link below) explores what the general public knows and believes about the environment, climate change, and science, and how their perceptions relate to education and are shaped by political orientation (see video link below). His body of work involves research that integrates data from social and natural-science domains. „Many people now are inclined toward distrust of scientists, and outright rejection of scientific findings that contradict their political beliefs,” said Hamilton. He notes that long before the recent discussion of „alternative facts,” people developed set views based on their ideology, even for straightforward physical facts such as whether the Arctic sea ice is melting. „Our research has shown that ideology whispers in people’s ears,” said Hamilton. „For some people, ideology has a dominant effect on how they answer survey questions, not just what they believe but who they will listen to, and how certain they feel about their knowledge.” Hamilton is available to discuss climate change and political views, knowledge and attitudes toward science, migration; resources and society in the Arctic (aka climigration). Hamilton speaking about climate change and ideology: http://bit.ly/2lh4GDR Research: http://tinyurl.com/koztxjy Contact: Robbin Ray, robbin.ray@unh.edu Environmental and Economic Issues Ines Azevedo, Ph.D. Associate Professor, Engineering and Public Policy; Co-Director, Climate and Energy Decision Making Center Carnegie Mellon University Dr. Azevedo can speak to the implications of President Trump’s policies, why the power sector is a perfect candidate for emissions reductions, emissions, and the carbon intensity of the power sector: „Since 2005, the U.S. was able to reduce our emissions from the power sector by about 25 percent. However, given the current policies, we may soon see an increase, rather than a decrease, in the emission intensity of the U.S. power sector. Instead of taking a position as a leader, the United States is running the risk of being a forever laggard.” Dr. Azevedo’s research interests lie at the intersection of environmental, technical, and economic issues, such as how to address the challenge of climate change and to move towards a more sustainable energy system. She tackles complex problems in which traditional engineering plays an important role but cannot provide a complete answer. In particular, she has been looking at how energy systems are likely to be shaped in the future, which requires comprehensive knowledge not only of the technologies that can address future energy needs but also of the decision-making process followed by different agents in the economy. Dr. Azevedo has also been working on assessing how specific policies will shape future energy systems, especially in a carbon-constrained world.

It is, unsurprisingly, a sharp break with the Obama administration’s commitments under the Paris Climate Agreement, but President Trump is also ignoring the Defense Department’s 2015 assessment that climate change represents a national security risk. According to the now-shelved report, environmental effects like shifting climate zones and rising sea levels will lead to disruptions and shocks for fragile governments around the world, as well as exacerbate tension and risk in conflict-prone regions.” Brozek writes on the intersection of environmental politics and international security, with a focus on freshwater and climate change. Contact:  Rick Peterson, richard.peterson@lawrence.edu Legal Challenges Ethan Shenkman Partner Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer „The EO is sweeping in scope, setting up a new policy review process focused on energy independence that will bring additional regulations within its sights. It raises as many questions as it answers, and presents both challenges and opportunities across all sectors. It is not the end point, but rather one step in a lengthy series of legal and administrative processes. The only certainty is that litigation will follow.” Shenkman is available to discuss all aspects of the executive order, including: Clean Power Plan, Clean Air Act/regulations, CEQ guidance, social cost of carbon, endangerment finding, administrative law/APA issues, future rulemaking processes, litigation/courts, Supreme Court, DOJ and EPA. He served for seven years as a political appointee in the Obama Administration. Most recently, he served as deputy general counsel at the US Environmental Protection Agency (2014-2017) and, prior to that, as deputy assistant attorney general at the US Department of Justice’s Environment and Natural Resources Division (2010-2014). During his post at the EPA, Shenkman was responsible for Clean Air Act regulations and litigation. Bio: http://www.apks.com/en/people/s/shenkman-ethan-g Contact: Issara Baumann, issara.baumann@apks.com Legal Challenges Jeffrey Gracer Principal (Partner) Sive, Paget & Riesel Gracer believes that President Trump’s Executive Order undermining the climate change policies enacted by his predecessor will lead to years of litigation as states and cities continue passing their own environmental regulations, challenging federal policies. He points out that the EPA can’t make decisions that are arbitrary and capricious, irrational, or unconstitutional; and lower courts are likely to be skeptical of wholesale efforts to walk away from the Supreme Court’s mandate to protect public health and the environment. Gracer also believes that President Trump’s policies will hurt American standing in the world on the issue of climate change, and cede a leadership role to other countries like China. „Despite the political theater last week at the EPA, it will take more than the stroke of a pen to undo the Obama-era rules,” Gracer said. Gracer is principal (partner) at New York City-based law firm Sive, Paget & Riesel, the oldest environmental law firm in the country. He has a vibrant domestic and international practice and is an expert in all state and federal environmental matters, including the Clean Air Act, Clean Water, Clean Power, hazardous waste disposal, and brownfield cleanups. He is the founder of the Environmental Program at the Vance Center for International Justice at the New York City Bar, which focuses on providing pro bon advice on environmental issues around the world. Bio: http://www.sprlaw.com/attorney/jeffrey-b-gracer/ Contact: Olivier Gibbons, ogibbons@courtstory.com Toxic Chemicals and the Ethics of Risk Carl Cranor Distinguished Professor of Philosophy University of California, Riverside Generations of toxic chemicals in everyday use – from ingredients in cosmetics and paint to nonstick cookware and upholstery – have sickened or killed thousands of Americans. Why? Because most of these substances are not regulated by the federal government. And the legal system – which offers the only recourse for deaths or injuries resulting from toxic exposures – often fails to properly use science to identify and assess whether or not products are toxic. Says Cranor: „Laws that are supposed to protect citi­zens from toxicity-caused diseases accomplish this so poorly that we rarely read of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Occupational Safety and Health administration, or the Consumer Product Safety Commission taking action to better protect us.” Cranor is known globally for his research on the regulation of toxic substances, the ethics of risk, and the philosophy of law and science. His work has changed how scientific testimony is addressed in court cases, as well as aspects of regulation in California. He is the author of „Tragic Failures: How and Why We Are Harmed by Toxic Chemicals” (Oxford University Press, 2017), „Legally Poisoned: How the Law Puts Us at Risk from Toxicants,” „Regulating Toxic Substances: A Philosophy of Science and the Law,” and „Toxic Torts: Science, Law and the Possibility of Justice.” He has served on science advisory panels (California’s Proposition 65, Electric and Magnetic Fields, Nanotechnology, and Biomonitoring Panels), as well as on Institute of Medicine and National Academy of Sciences Committees.

Wake, Ph.D. Research Professor in Climatology and Glaciology University of New Hampshire Wake is available to discuss climate change, health impacts, sustainability as it relates to climate change, the importance for preparedness and building community resilience, and distrust of scientists (see video link below). He leads a research program investigating regional climate and environmental change through the analysis of ice cores, instrumental data, and phenological records, with a focus on the northeast United States, the Arctic, and central Asia. His research on several regional climate assessments, like flooding, in the northeast United States has been shared with state and federal agencies and has been covered widely in the media. His recent climate change research looking at the New Hampshire seacoast had him commenting that „New Hampshire’s climate is already changing and having an impact on people’s lives. It’s hotter and wetter, there are more extreme precipitation events, our sea levels are rising and our health is being affected.” Wake on climate change: http://bit.ly/2l5qd04 Contact: Robbin Ray, robbin.ray@unh.edu Climate Change Science Neil Leary, Ph.D. Founding Director, Center for Sustainability Education Dickinson College Leary, a leader on international climate change studies and projects, is available to discuss climate change science, climate change risks, the Paris Agreement, carbon pricing, and carbon pollution reduction. He has conducted research on climate change risks and policies for 20 years and has brought Dickinson students to the UNFCCC climate conferences in Paris, Lima, Durban and Copenhagen to conduct research on transnational governance of climate change. Leary teaches courses on climate change, sustainable communities and sustainable campuses. He has been a participant in the 1995, 2001, 2007 and 2014 science assessments of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and has led international studies of climate change risks and adaptation that have involved more than 300 scientists from 50 countries. Before joining Dickinson, Leary served as senior scientist at the Global Change System for Analysis, Research and Training and as senior economist at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

In the meantime, regulated businesses can operate without the additional costs of complying with the plan. 2) Social Cost of Carbon: The EPA is expected to discontinue the use of the social cost of carbon metric. The Interagency Working Group on Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases will be disbanded and policy documents associated with the metric withdrawn. 3) Federal Lands: The EO directs the Department of Interior to lift the moratorium on coal leasing on federal lands, which may not be subject to legitimate challenge in court. In contrast, the direction set forth by the EO to suspend and revise rules limiting hydraulic fracturing and regulating oil and gas operations on federal lands will require a full rulemaking process, which could take the better part of a year followed by several years of litigation. Belcher has a national, multidisciplinary practice counseling clients in the utility, power and pipeline sectors. He represented Enbridge Inc. in the acquisition of a 103-MW wind project in West Virginia and he represented Freepoint Commodities in its joint venture with ArcLight Capital Partners to acquire certain storage terminals, refining units and marine infrastructure at the former Hovensa refinery in the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Internet Law and Ethics Professor, Communications Department Adelphi University, Garden City, N.Y. „There’s lots of misinformation about this — although it’s still not good news. In short, nothing is changing. You didn’t have online privacy to begin with, so you’re not losing anything. The FCC had recently adopted new privacy rules that were set to go into place, but the new legislation stops that from happening. No, someone can’t buy your specific internet history. That’s a myth. A VPN won’t entirely shield your privacy, either – that’s another myth. What’s going to happen is you’re going to see more and more targeted ads when you surf online. So, for example, if your kid’s teacher emails you that he’s struggling in algebra, you might see ads about tutoring services. If you do a Google search for flights to Paris, expect to see ads from airlines and hotel websites. Deregulation of internet service providers has been a disaster for Americans. ISPs haven’t delivered the promises they made when they begged Congress to end common carriage regulations in the ’90s. Twenty years later, we’ve gone from being a pioneer in internet service to now lagging behind developing countries in terms of access, cost, speed, privacy protections and more. And this situation will probably continue to get worse. It looks like net neutrality is next on the chopping block.” Website: http://www.adelphi.edu Contact: Kali Chan, chan@adelphi.edu How Lawsuits May Be the Ultimate Unraveling of the Trump Presidency James Goodnow Legal & Political Commentator Fennemore Craig „Allegations about Trump and sexual misconduct are in the news again. This time it’s because Summer Zervos, a former ‚Apprentice’ contestant who alleged Trump made improper advances, is suing Trump for defamation. This week, Trump’s lawyers indicated they will seek to have Zervos’ claim dismissed because they claim Trump is immunized from state court suits because he is president. Will Trump’s argument carry the day? Probably not. In 1997, the United States Supreme Court held unanimously in Clinton v. Jones that Bill Clinton could be sued while in office for acts allegedly committed before he assumed office. The case related to allegations of sexual harassment from former Arkansas state employee Paula Jones. In the case, the Supreme Court rejected Clinton’s claims that he was immune, noting: ‚The separation-of-powers doctrine does not require federal courts to stay all private actions against the President until he leaves office.’ So why is Trump challenging this seemingly clear case?” ProfNet Profile: http://www.profnetconnect.com/james.goodnow Bio: https://lambergoodnow.com/legalcommentator/ Contact: Terence J.

Going nuclear? Three Democratic Senators have indicated they will break party ranks and support President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch and oppose filibuster — nearly half the number needed to avoid the ‚nuclear option,’ the changing of the Senate rules to allow confirmation by a simple majority. With Republicans having a 52-48 edge in the Senate, the question is whether Senate Majority Leader McConnell can woo the five additional votes needed to get to 60. Based on the current landscape, it’s not looking good. Democrats now have enough votes to filibuster the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court.” ProfNet Profile: http://www.profnetconnect.com/james.goodnow Bio: https://lambergoodnow.com/legalcommentator/ Contact: Terence J. Murnin, tmurnin@fclaw.com UK’s Process of Withdrawal From European Union Raj Bhala Associate Dean for International & Comparative Law; Rice Distinguished Professor, School of Law University of Kansas Bhala can discuss the triggering of Article 50, which officially begins the UK’s process of withdrawal from the European Union (Brexit), and international trade and political negotiations now set to take place: „The United Kingdom is about to embark on the most complex set of negotiations it has encountered since the era of decolonization, when it withdrew from countries across the British Empire. Unlike that era, which spanned several decades, now the UK has limited time: two years. Also unlike that era, the UK is dealing with the entire world – that is, the other 163 members of the World Trade Organization. Finally, its previous colonial withdrawal did not threaten the integrity of the UK itself. Now, its future as a ‚United’ Kingdom is in peril. For America, the ramifications with its closest ally, its special relationship, cover economic, political, military and national security matters. For Americans, a pillar of their post-Second World War, post-Cold War world is changing.” Bhala has authored dozens of journal articles and books, including „TPP Objectively: Law, Economics, and National Security of History’s Largest, Longest Free Trade Agreement,” „Understanding Islamic Law (Shari’a),” „Modern GATT Law” and „International Trade Law: An Interdisciplinary, Non-Western Textbook.” Contact: Mike Krings, mkrings@ku.edu YouTube Advertisers Boycott Robert J. Zafft Privacy and Technology Attorney, Greensfelder, Hemker & Gale, P.C. (St. Louis) Business Ethics Teacher, Washington University in St. Louis „The suspension of their advertising on YouTube by blue-chip brands like PepsiCo, Johnson & Johnson, Walmart and Starbucks due to concern over automated ad placements reflects a maturing of social media and society. Current YouTube technology cannot adequately screen the content, and the brands worry that automated ad placements will pair their brands with content that promotes terrorism, racism, violence, or other messages highly offensive to customers. For a long time, publishers have acted like hotel owners who happily collect rent while turning a blind eye to unsavory or illegal goings on in the rooms they let. Now, the advertisers who foot the bill have begun to say, ‚That’s no longer good enough.’ And it’s not just the problem of YouTube owner Google, which has vowed to address the issue. Brand risk will likely move down the food chain, affecting other publishers, ad networks and ad buyers. Social media will likely get faster and more effective at naming and shaming businesses involved.” Zafft is able to discuss the ethics surrounding this matter, as well as a possible solution involving „collaborative filtering,” as a collective response to the problem: „Collaborative filtering would assess content by looking at who posts it and who watches it. Collaborative filtering improves with the number of companies and publishers that participate. If top publishers and ad networks wire into the same filtering system, they can say to ad buyers and consumers, ‚Our system may not be perfect, but it’s the best there is, and we are working hard with others to improve it.’ This answer may go a long way to diminishing or defusing brand risk.” Contact: Randy Labuzinski, rlabuzinski@jaffepr.com EXPERT ROUNDUP: Trump’s Environmental Policy (16 experts) With President Trump signing a sweeping executive order that rescinds at least six Obama-era executive orders aimed at curbing climate change and regulating carbon emissions, following are experts who are available for interviews on President Trump’s environmental policy: Climate Change and Ideology Lawrence Hamilton Professor of Sociology University of New Hampshire Hamilton’s recent research (see link below) explores what the general public knows and believes about the environment, climate change, and science, and how their perceptions relate to education and are shaped by political orientation (see video link below). His body of work involves research that integrates data from social and natural-science domains. „Many people now are inclined toward distrust of scientists, and outright rejection of scientific findings that contradict their political beliefs,” said Hamilton. He notes that long before the recent discussion of „alternative facts,” people developed set views based on their ideology, even for straightforward physical facts such as whether the Arctic sea ice is melting. „Our research has shown that ideology whispers in people’s ears,” said Hamilton. „For some people, ideology has a dominant effect on how they answer survey questions, not just what they believe but who they will listen to, and how certain they feel about their knowledge.” Hamilton is available to discuss climate change and political views, knowledge and attitudes toward science, migration; resources and society in the Arctic (aka climigration). Hamilton speaking about climate change and ideology: http://bit.ly/2lh4GDR Research: http://tinyurl.com/koztxjy Contact: Robbin Ray, robbin.ray@unh.edu Environmental and Economic Issues Ines Azevedo, Ph.D. Associate Professor, Engineering and Public Policy; Co-Director, Climate and Energy Decision Making Center Carnegie Mellon University Dr. Azevedo can speak to the implications of President Trump’s policies, why the power sector is a perfect candidate for emissions reductions, emissions, and the carbon intensity of the power sector: „Since 2005, the U.S. was able to reduce our emissions from the power sector by about 25 percent. However, given the current policies, we may soon see an increase, rather than a decrease, in the emission intensity of the U.S. power sector. Instead of taking a position as a leader, the United States is running the risk of being a forever laggard.” Dr. Azevedo’s research interests lie at the intersection of environmental, technical, and economic issues, such as how to address the challenge of climate change and to move towards a more sustainable energy system. She tackles complex problems in which traditional engineering plays an important role but cannot provide a complete answer. In particular, she has been looking at how energy systems are likely to be shaped in the future, which requires comprehensive knowledge not only of the technologies that can address future energy needs but also of the decision-making process followed by different agents in the economy. Dr. Azevedo has also been working on assessing how specific policies will shape future energy systems, especially in a carbon-constrained world.

It is, unsurprisingly, a sharp break with the Obama administration’s commitments under the Paris Climate Agreement, but President Trump is also ignoring the Defense Department’s 2015 assessment that climate change represents a national security risk. According to the now-shelved report, environmental effects like shifting climate zones and rising sea levels will lead to disruptions and shocks for fragile governments around the world, as well as exacerbate tension and risk in conflict-prone regions.” Brozek writes on the intersection of environmental politics and international security, with a focus on freshwater and climate change. Contact:  Rick Peterson, richard.peterson@lawrence.edu Legal Challenges Ethan Shenkman Partner Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer „The EO is sweeping in scope, setting up a new policy review process focused on energy independence that will bring additional regulations within its sights. It raises as many questions as it answers, and presents both challenges and opportunities across all sectors. It is not the end point, but rather one step in a lengthy series of legal and administrative processes. The only certainty is that litigation will follow.” Shenkman is available to discuss all aspects of the executive order, including: Clean Power Plan, Clean Air Act/regulations, CEQ guidance, social cost of carbon, endangerment finding, administrative law/APA issues, future rulemaking processes, litigation/courts, Supreme Court, DOJ and EPA. He served for seven years as a political appointee in the Obama Administration. Most recently, he served as deputy general counsel at the US Environmental Protection Agency (2014-2017) and, prior to that, as deputy assistant attorney general at the US Department of Justice’s Environment and Natural Resources Division (2010-2014). During his post at the EPA, Shenkman was responsible for Clean Air Act regulations and litigation. Bio: http://www.apks.com/en/people/s/shenkman-ethan-g Contact: Issara Baumann, issara.baumann@apks.com Legal Challenges Jeffrey Gracer Principal (Partner) Sive, Paget & Riesel Gracer believes that President Trump’s Executive Order undermining the climate change policies enacted by his predecessor will lead to years of litigation as states and cities continue passing their own environmental regulations, challenging federal policies. He points out that the EPA can’t make decisions that are arbitrary and capricious, irrational, or unconstitutional; and lower courts are likely to be skeptical of wholesale efforts to walk away from the Supreme Court’s mandate to protect public health and the environment. Gracer also believes that President Trump’s policies will hurt American standing in the world on the issue of climate change, and cede a leadership role to other countries like China. „Despite the political theater last week at the EPA, it will take more than the stroke of a pen to undo the Obama-era rules,” Gracer said. Gracer is principal (partner) at New York City-based law firm Sive, Paget & Riesel, the oldest environmental law firm in the country. He has a vibrant domestic and international practice and is an expert in all state and federal environmental matters, including the Clean Air Act, Clean Water, Clean Power, hazardous waste disposal, and brownfield cleanups. He is the founder of the Environmental Program at the Vance Center for International Justice at the New York City Bar, which focuses on providing pro bon advice on environmental issues around the world.

Why? Because most of these substances are not regulated by the federal government. And the legal system – which offers the only recourse for deaths or injuries resulting from toxic exposures – often fails to properly use science to identify and assess whether or not products are toxic. Says Cranor: „Laws that are supposed to protect citi­zens from toxicity-caused diseases accomplish this so poorly that we rarely read of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Occupational Safety and Health administration, or the Consumer Product Safety Commission taking action to better protect us.” Cranor is known globally for his research on the regulation of toxic substances, the ethics of risk, and the philosophy of law and science. His work has changed how scientific testimony is addressed in court cases, as well as aspects of regulation in California. He is the author of „Tragic Failures: How and Why We Are Harmed by Toxic Chemicals” (Oxford University Press, 2017), „Legally Poisoned: How the Law Puts Us at Risk from Toxicants,” „Regulating Toxic Substances: A Philosophy of Science and the Law,” and „Toxic Torts: Science, Law and the Possibility of Justice.” He has served on science advisory panels (California’s Proposition 65, Electric and Magnetic Fields, Nanotechnology, and Biomonitoring Panels), as well as on Institute of Medicine and National Academy of Sciences Committees.

His research on several regional climate assessments, like flooding, in the northeast United States has been shared with state and federal agencies and has been covered widely in the media. His recent climate change research looking at the New Hampshire seacoast had him commenting that „New Hampshire’s climate is already changing and having an impact on people’s lives.

In the meantime, regulated businesses can operate without the additional costs of complying with the plan. 2) Social Cost of Carbon: The EPA is expected to discontinue the use of the social cost of carbon metric. The Interagency Working Group on Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases will be disbanded and policy documents associated with the metric withdrawn. 3) Federal Lands: The EO directs the Department of Interior to lift the moratorium on coal leasing on federal lands, which may not be subject to legitimate challenge in court. In contrast, the direction set forth by the EO to suspend and revise rules limiting hydraulic fracturing and regulating oil and gas operations on federal lands will require a full rulemaking process, which could take the better part of a year followed by several years of litigation.

Internet Law and Ethics Professor, Communications Department Adelphi University, Garden City, N.Y. „There’s lots of misinformation about this — although it’s still not good news. In short, nothing is changing. You didn’t have online privacy to begin with, so you’re not losing anything. The FCC had recently adopted new privacy rules that were set to go into place, but the new legislation stops that from happening. No, someone can’t buy your specific internet history. That’s a myth. A VPN won’t entirely shield your privacy, either – that’s another myth. What’s going to happen is you’re going to see more and more targeted ads when you surf online. So, for example, if your kid’s teacher emails you that he’s struggling in algebra, you might see ads about tutoring services. If you do a Google search for flights to Paris, expect to see ads from airlines and hotel websites. Deregulation of internet service providers has been a disaster for Americans. ISPs haven’t delivered the promises they made when they begged Congress to end common carriage regulations in the ’90s. Twenty years later, we’ve gone from being a pioneer in internet service to now lagging behind developing countries in terms of access, cost, speed, privacy protections and more. And this situation will probably continue to get worse. It looks like net neutrality is next on the chopping block.” Website: http://www.adelphi.edu Contact: Kali Chan, chan@adelphi.edu How Lawsuits May Be the Ultimate Unraveling of the Trump Presidency James Goodnow Legal & Political Commentator Fennemore Craig „Allegations about Trump and sexual misconduct are in the news again. This time it’s because Summer Zervos, a former ‚Apprentice’ contestant who alleged Trump made improper advances, is suing Trump for defamation. This week, Trump’s lawyers indicated they will seek to have Zervos’ claim dismissed because they claim Trump is immunized from state court suits because he is president. Will Trump’s argument carry the day? Probably not. In 1997, the United States Supreme Court held unanimously in Clinton v. Jones that Bill Clinton could be sued while in office for acts allegedly committed before he assumed office. The case related to allegations of sexual harassment from former Arkansas state employee Paula Jones. In the case, the Supreme Court rejected Clinton’s claims that he was immune, noting: ‚The separation-of-powers doctrine does not require federal courts to stay all private actions against the President until he leaves office.’ So why is Trump challenging this seemingly clear case?” ProfNet Profile: http://www.profnetconnect.com/james.goodnow Bio: https://lambergoodnow.com/legalcommentator/ Contact: Terence J. Murnin, tmurnin@fclaw.com How the Gorsuch Vote on Friday May Change the Supreme Court Forever James Goodnow Legal & Political Commentator Fennemore Craig, Phoenix „This Friday, April 7, is shaping up to be a huge day in our country’s history, and to borrow a line from Senator Mitch McConnell, whether or not Judge Gorsuch gets his new robes ‚really depends on our Democratic friends.’ How will this week unfold? Going nuclear? Three Democratic Senators have indicated they will break party ranks and support President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch and oppose filibuster — nearly half the number needed to avoid the ‚nuclear option,’ the changing of the Senate rules to allow confirmation by a simple majority. With Republicans having a 52-48 edge in the Senate, the question is whether Senate Majority Leader McConnell can woo the five additional votes needed to get to 60. Based on the current landscape, it’s not looking good. Democrats now have enough votes to filibuster the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court.” ProfNet Profile: http://www.profnetconnect.com/james.goodnow Bio: https://lambergoodnow.com/legalcommentator/ Contact: Terence J. Murnin, tmurnin@fclaw.com UK’s Process of Withdrawal From European Union Raj Bhala Associate Dean for International & Comparative Law; Rice Distinguished Professor, School of Law University of Kansas Bhala can discuss the triggering of Article 50, which officially begins the UK’s process of withdrawal from the European Union (Brexit), and international trade and political negotiations now set to take place: „The United Kingdom is about to embark on the most complex set of negotiations it has encountered since the era of decolonization, when it withdrew from countries across the British Empire. Unlike that era, which spanned several decades, now the UK has limited time: two years. Also unlike that era, the UK is dealing with the entire world – that is, the other 163 members of the World Trade Organization. Finally, its previous colonial withdrawal did not threaten the integrity of the UK itself. Now, its future as a ‚United’ Kingdom is in peril. For America, the ramifications with its closest ally, its special relationship, cover economic, political, military and national security matters. For Americans, a pillar of their post-Second World War, post-Cold War world is changing.” Bhala has authored dozens of journal articles and books, including „TPP Objectively: Law, Economics, and National Security of History’s Largest, Longest Free Trade Agreement,” „Understanding Islamic Law (Shari’a),” „Modern GATT Law” and „International Trade Law: An Interdisciplinary, Non-Western Textbook.” Contact: Mike Krings, mkrings@ku.edu YouTube Advertisers Boycott Robert J. Zafft Privacy and Technology Attorney, Greensfelder, Hemker & Gale, P.C. (St. Louis) Business Ethics Teacher, Washington University in St. Louis „The suspension of their advertising on YouTube by blue-chip brands like PepsiCo, Johnson & Johnson, Walmart and Starbucks due to concern over automated ad placements reflects a maturing of social media and society. Current YouTube technology cannot adequately screen the content, and the brands worry that automated ad placements will pair their brands with content that promotes terrorism, racism, violence, or other messages highly offensive to customers. For a long time, publishers have acted like hotel owners who happily collect rent while turning a blind eye to unsavory or illegal goings on in the rooms they let. Now, the advertisers who foot the bill have begun to say, ‚That’s no longer good enough.’ And it’s not just the problem of YouTube owner Google, which has vowed to address the issue. Brand risk will likely move down the food chain, affecting other publishers, ad networks and ad buyers. Social media will likely get faster and more effective at naming and shaming businesses involved.” Zafft is able to discuss the ethics surrounding this matter, as well as a possible solution involving „collaborative filtering,” as a collective response to the problem: „Collaborative filtering would assess content by looking at who posts it and who watches it. Collaborative filtering improves with the number of companies and publishers that participate. If top publishers and ad networks wire into the same filtering system, they can say to ad buyers and consumers, ‚Our system may not be perfect, but it’s the best there is, and we are working hard with others to improve it.’ This answer may go a long way to diminishing or defusing brand risk.” Contact: Randy Labuzinski, rlabuzinski@jaffepr.com EXPERT ROUNDUP: Trump’s Environmental Policy (16 experts) With President Trump signing a sweeping executive order that rescinds at least six Obama-era executive orders aimed at curbing climate change and regulating carbon emissions, following are experts who are available for interviews on President Trump’s environmental policy: Climate Change and Ideology Lawrence Hamilton Professor of Sociology University of New Hampshire Hamilton’s recent research (see link below) explores what the general public knows and believes about the environment, climate change, and science, and how their perceptions relate to education and are shaped by political orientation (see video link below). His body of work involves research that integrates data from social and natural-science domains. „Many people now are inclined toward distrust of scientists, and outright rejection of scientific findings that contradict their political beliefs,” said Hamilton. He notes that long before the recent discussion of „alternative facts,” people developed set views based on their ideology, even for straightforward physical facts such as whether the Arctic sea ice is melting. „Our research has shown that ideology whispers in people’s ears,” said Hamilton. „For some people, ideology has a dominant effect on how they answer survey questions, not just what they believe but who they will listen to, and how certain they feel about their knowledge.” Hamilton is available to discuss climate change and political views, knowledge and attitudes toward science, migration; resources and society in the Arctic (aka climigration). Hamilton speaking about climate change and ideology: http://bit.ly/2lh4GDR Research: http://tinyurl.com/koztxjy Contact: Robbin Ray, robbin.ray@unh.edu Environmental and Economic Issues Ines Azevedo, Ph.D. Associate Professor, Engineering and Public Policy; Co-Director, Climate and Energy Decision Making Center Carnegie Mellon University Dr. Azevedo can speak to the implications of President Trump’s policies, why the power sector is a perfect candidate for emissions reductions, emissions, and the carbon intensity of the power sector: „Since 2005, the U.S. was able to reduce our emissions from the power sector by about 25 percent. However, given the current policies, we may soon see an increase, rather than a decrease, in the emission intensity of the U.S. power sector. Instead of taking a position as a leader, the United States is running the risk of being a forever laggard.” Dr. Azevedo’s research interests lie at the intersection of environmental, technical, and economic issues, such as how to address the challenge of climate change and to move towards a more sustainable energy system. She tackles complex problems in which traditional engineering plays an important role but cannot provide a complete answer. In particular, she has been looking at how energy systems are likely to be shaped in the future, which requires comprehensive knowledge not only of the technologies that can address future energy needs but also of the decision-making process followed by different agents in the economy. Dr. Azevedo has also been working on assessing how specific policies will shape future energy systems, especially in a carbon-constrained world.

It is, unsurprisingly, a sharp break with the Obama administration’s commitments under the Paris Climate Agreement, but President Trump is also ignoring the Defense Department’s 2015 assessment that climate change represents a national security risk. According to the now-shelved report, environmental effects like shifting climate zones and rising sea levels will lead to disruptions and shocks for fragile governments around the world, as well as exacerbate tension and risk in conflict-prone regions.” Brozek writes on the intersection of environmental politics and international security, with a focus on freshwater and climate change. Contact:  Rick Peterson, richard.peterson@lawrence.edu Legal Challenges Ethan Shenkman Partner Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer „The EO is sweeping in scope, setting up a new policy review process focused on energy independence that will bring additional regulations within its sights. It raises as many questions as it answers, and presents both challenges and opportunities across all sectors. It is not the end point, but rather one step in a lengthy series of legal and administrative processes. The only certainty is that litigation will follow.” Shenkman is available to discuss all aspects of the executive order, including: Clean Power Plan, Clean Air Act/regulations, CEQ guidance, social cost of carbon, endangerment finding, administrative law/APA issues, future rulemaking processes, litigation/courts, Supreme Court, DOJ and EPA. He served for seven years as a political appointee in the Obama Administration. Most recently, he served as deputy general counsel at the US Environmental Protection Agency (2014-2017) and, prior to that, as deputy assistant attorney general at the US Department of Justice’s Environment and Natural Resources Division (2010-2014). During his post at the EPA, Shenkman was responsible for Clean Air Act regulations and litigation. Bio: http://www.apks.com/en/people/s/shenkman-ethan-g Contact: Issara Baumann, issara.baumann@apks.com Legal Challenges Jeffrey Gracer Principal (Partner) Sive, Paget & Riesel Gracer believes that President Trump’s Executive Order undermining the climate change policies enacted by his predecessor will lead to years of litigation as states and cities continue passing their own environmental regulations, challenging federal policies. He points out that the EPA can’t make decisions that are arbitrary and capricious, irrational, or unconstitutional; and lower courts are likely to be skeptical of wholesale efforts to walk away from the Supreme Court’s mandate to protect public health and the environment. Gracer also believes that President Trump’s policies will hurt American standing in the world on the issue of climate change, and cede a leadership role to other countries like China. „Despite the political theater last week at the EPA, it will take more than the stroke of a pen to undo the Obama-era rules,” Gracer said. Gracer is principal (partner) at New York City-based law firm Sive, Paget & Riesel, the oldest environmental law firm in the country. He has a vibrant domestic and international practice and is an expert in all state and federal environmental matters, including the Clean Air Act, Clean Water, Clean Power, hazardous waste disposal, and brownfield cleanups. He is the founder of the Environmental Program at the Vance Center for International Justice at the New York City Bar, which focuses on providing pro bon advice on environmental issues around the world.

Why? Because most of these substances are not regulated by the federal government. And the legal system – which offers the only recourse for deaths or injuries resulting from toxic exposures – often fails to properly use science to identify and assess whether or not products are toxic. Says Cranor: „Laws that are supposed to protect citi­zens from toxicity-caused diseases accomplish this so poorly that we rarely read of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Occupational Safety and Health administration, or the Consumer Product Safety Commission taking action to better protect us.” Cranor is known globally for his research on the regulation of toxic substances, the ethics of risk, and the philosophy of law and science. His work has changed how scientific testimony is addressed in court cases, as well as aspects of regulation in California. He is the author of „Tragic Failures: How and Why We Are Harmed by Toxic Chemicals” (Oxford University Press, 2017), „Legally Poisoned: How the Law Puts Us at Risk from Toxicants,” „Regulating Toxic Substances: A Philosophy of Science and the Law,” and „Toxic Torts: Science, Law and the Possibility of Justice.” He has served on science advisory panels (California’s Proposition 65, Electric and Magnetic Fields, Nanotechnology, and Biomonitoring Panels), as well as on Institute of Medicine and National Academy of Sciences Committees.

Wake, Ph.D. Research Professor in Climatology and Glaciology University of New Hampshire Wake is available to discuss climate change, health impacts, sustainability as it relates to climate change, the importance for preparedness and building community resilience, and distrust of scientists (see video link below). He leads a research program investigating regional climate and environmental change through the analysis of ice cores, instrumental data, and phenological records, with a focus on the northeast United States, the Arctic, and central Asia. His research on several regional climate assessments, like flooding, in the northeast United States has been shared with state and federal agencies and has been covered widely in the media. His recent climate change research looking at the New Hampshire seacoast had him commenting that „New Hampshire’s climate is already changing and having an impact on people’s lives. It’s hotter and wetter, there are more extreme precipitation events, our sea levels are rising and our health is being affected.” Wake on climate change: http://bit.ly/2l5qd04 Contact: Robbin Ray, robbin.ray@unh.edu Climate Change Science Neil Leary, Ph.D. Founding Director, Center for Sustainability Education Dickinson College Leary, a leader on international climate change studies and projects, is available to discuss climate change science, climate change risks, the Paris Agreement, carbon pricing, and carbon pollution reduction.

In the meantime, regulated businesses can operate without the additional costs of complying with the plan. 2) Social Cost of Carbon: The EPA is expected to discontinue the use of the social cost of carbon metric. The Interagency Working Group on Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases will be disbanded and policy documents associated with the metric withdrawn. 3) Federal Lands: The EO directs the Department of Interior to lift the moratorium on coal leasing on federal lands, which may not be subject to legitimate challenge in court. In contrast, the direction set forth by the EO to suspend and revise rules limiting hydraulic fracturing and regulating oil and gas operations on federal lands will require a full rulemaking process, which could take the better part of a year followed by several years of litigation. Belcher has a national, multidisciplinary practice counseling clients in the utility, power and pipeline sectors. He represented Enbridge Inc. in the acquisition of a 103-MW wind project in West Virginia and he represented Freepoint Commodities in its joint venture with ArcLight Capital Partners to acquire certain storage terminals, refining units and marine infrastructure at the former Hovensa refinery in the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Verizon was scooped into admitting that it’s going to rename the combined zombie corpses of AOL and Yahoo “Oath,” which is a terrible name that comes second only to Tronc. 2. President Trump signed the bill that allows ISPs to share your browsing data without permission. This is everything Verizon and AOL have been working toward over the past few years. Like every other broadband provider, Verizon wants to extract more revenue from its network by increasingly owning the media that travels over it. But unlike AT&T (which bought DirecTV and is in the process of buying Time Warner) or Comcast (which bought NBCUniversal and invested in companies like BuzzFeed and our own Vox Media), Verizon’s plan is far more lowbrow: it’s going to churn out as much cheap content as it can from AOL and Yahoo and tell advertisers it can do a better job of delivering eyeballs because it has better ad-tracking capabilities than Google and Facebook. What Verizon wants, more than anything, is a piece of Google’s ad business. track your device locations, browsing history to mine your behaviors, target you, gut net neutrality but also have a few pubs in house!— Jason Kint (@jason_kint) April 4, 2017 This isn’t a new or small plan — it’s been AOL CEO Tim Armstrong’s vision for years now. (Armstrong was the head of Google ad sales for years before taking over AOL.) AOL has been buying marketing and ad tech startups nonstop since Armstrong took over in 2009; they all have names that would cause normal, non-influencer humans to die in an explosion of pure shame. Millennial Media. RYOT. Adap.tv. Vidibile. Convertro. Buysight. Every single one of these companies is designed to better target advertising to you, the hapless AOL consumer. What Verizon wants, more than anything, is a piece of Google’s ad business Then there’s Armstrong’s purchase of The Huffington Post, which now seems like just a prelude to his conquest of Yahoo. HuffPo was once the ultimate in cheap scale, generating millions of free contributor page views on which to place all that ad tech, but Yahoo is next-level cheap scale. People still use Yahoo as a homepage and primary search engine. They look up financial data. They play fantasy sports and dive into databases of stats. Something... happens on Tumblr. Yahoo Mail can’t stop losing your passwords but it’s still massive. Yahoo delivers millions and millions of pages that cost almost nothing to produce, all waiting to be strip-mined of data and retargeted with advertising. None of this was a secret when Verizon bought AOL — the Ad Age headline was straight-up “Ad-Tech, not Content, Is King in the Verizon-AOL Deal.” Can’t be any clearer than that. “The ability to combine my browsing history and my location on the most personal and sensitive thing we own — the smartphone — with the tonnage inventory of AOL, MSN, and Yahoo is an interesting play,” says Jason Kint, the CEO of Digital Content Next, a trade group dedicated to better online advertising. “They know what they're doing. I just think it's bad for the marketplace overall.” Killing net neutrality is next on the list And now, with the new privacy not-rules, Verizon is free to take the data generated from the tracking supercookies it imposes on its network customers, mash it up with AOL’s ad stack, and promise advertisers hyper-targeted marketing information that can’t be blocked or stopped because Verizon will own both the pipes and an enormous amount of the content flowing through it. VZ: We want to combine an ISP & ad network Devil: Name your oath 2 years later: VZ: You took care of Congress. We named it "Oath" Devil: … https://t.co/kUaN2cdEHk— Ben Thompson (@benthompson) April 4, 2017 The ISPs were explicit about what they wanted during the Congressional debates on the privacy rules — they have tons of consumer data because they own the pipes, and they want to be able to use that data without permission. Again, it wasn’t even subtle. Rep. Bill Flores (R, TX) just characterized this as "leveling the playing field" between ISPs and content companies (eg Verizon vs. FB)— tc (@chillmage) March 28, 2017 Verizon owns the networks that deliver the mobile data, along with lots of broadband internet to the home, plus the stores where many people buy their smartphones and the bloatware that runs on them. It wants to take the foundation and build itself up into an ISP, a content company, and an ad network, a corporate hydra that feeds on boardroom buzzwords like synergy and relevant content and generates names like Go90 and Oath. Kint says Verizon’s plans are “very concerning.” “Although Facebook and Google are clearly an [advertising] duopoly based on industry trends, Verizon, without net neutrality (their intention next) or privacy rules, is a chokepoint to consumer choice,” he says. “Verizon will be able to prioritize Oath's content. Imagine go90 getting priority over outside parties.” As a reminder, Go90 was the disastrous video service Verizon is now completely rebooting with the team from yet another acquisition. We made this video when Go90 came out; the product was such an obvious disaster we had to selectively decide which clueless bits to focus on. Oath might fail the same way Go90 has failed; it’s not like AOL and Verizon are terrific at executing these content-based ideas. But this is Verizon’s next big plan to generate revenue and growth — it’s a lot cheaper and simpler to extract revenue from hyper-targeted ads on the world’s biggest content farm than it is to compete against AT&T and Comcast in broadband deployment. “I've been vocal about Verizon's very active role in stripping any consumer privacy protection from the market. It lowers the bar for everyone including Facebook and Google. That’s why the duopoly also reportedly supported the effort,” says Kint. “I expect even more ad blocking and less trust of digital advertising, which ends up harming everyone that matters, including marketers, publishers, and importantly consumers.” Whatever happens with Oath, it’s not a joke — it’s the beginning of a very important fight about ad tracking across the entire internet.

Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Scene More Biz Music Legit Jobs Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition: U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe Home Digital News YouTube TV Launches in Five Cities, Inks Deal With AMC Networks for Internet Skinny Bundle Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor @xpangler Share This Article LinkedIn Email Print Talk Courtesy of YouTube April 5, 2017 | 10:00AM PT Google offering free 30-day trial, free Chromecast adapter while supplies last YouTube is launching its $35 monthly TV package Wednesday in five U.S. markets — New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco Bay Area, Chicago and Philadelphia — and announced a deal with AMC Networks to add the cabler’s channels to the lineup. With the roughly 50-channel bundle, priced at less than half the average cost of cable TV, the internet video giant is angling to win over millennials who are already big YouTube fans but have shied away from traditional pay TV. YouTube TV includes live and VOD programming, an unlimited cloud-based DVR (which will store recordings for nine months), and access to YouTube Red originals. For now, people across a large portion of the U.S. will be unable to subscribe to YouTube TV; Google says it’s working to bring the service to additional metro areas. One of the gating factors: getting the deals for local TV broadcast networks in each market. YouTube TV’s anchor programming comprises the broadcast and cable networks from four media conglomerates: Disney/ABC, 21st Century Fox, CBS and NBCUniversal. Soon after launch, YouTube TV will add AMC Networks’ AMC, BBC America, IFC, SundanceTV, WeTV and BBC World News. YouTube TV is launching in the initial five cities amid a flurry of action in the over-the-top TV space. Hulu prepping its own sub-$40 skinny bundle, set to join others including AT&T’s DirecTV Now, Dish’s Sling TV, Sony PlayStation Vue and FuboTV. Related YouTube Unveils Live TV Bundle for $35 per Month With 40 Channels “We are not trying to replicate other offerings in the marketplace. We are letting users drive this for us,” said Kelly Merryman, VP of content partnerships for YouTube. “We tried to identify the right set of programming from Day One — and I think we’ve got it.” In evaluating what channels to pack into its skinny bundle, YouTube found that its target audience of users 18-34 wanted live sports and primetime shows. That led it to the major broadcasters, Merryman said. It’s adding AMC because its networks also skew toward millennial viewers — with “The Walking Dead” still standing as the No. 1 primetime show on television in the demo. Absent from YouTube TV’s lineup for the foreseeable future: Time Warner’s HBO and Turner networks, including CNN, TBS and TNT; Viacom networks like Comedy Central and MTV; Discovery Communications; and Scripps Networks Interactive’s channels like HGTV and Food Network. Merryman said YouTube is continually talking to content partners about potential distribution, but that the lineup is set for the launch period. Channels that are in the YouTube TV mix include ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, ESPN, Fox Sports Networks, Comcast SportsNet, FX, USA Network, Disney Channel, Bravo, MSNBC and Fox News. CBS-owned Showtime — the only premium channel available in YouTube TV right now — and Fox Soccer Plus are available for an additional monthly charge. Meanwhile, also under the multiyear pact with AMC Networks, YouTube TV will offer the programmer’s SVOD services Sundance Now, dedicated to independent film, TV series and documentaries for $7 per month, and Shudder, offering movies for fans of thriller, supernatural and horror films, for $5 per month. “YouTube TV is a new and innovative platform, and they have special appeal for a young, mobile-first demo,” said Bob Broussard, president of distribution for AMC Networks. The programmer’s “tight group of channels” that skew toward the under-40 set are “perfectly suited for a platform like this.” Currently, YouTube TV is available to watch on TV only with a Google Chromecast or Chromecast-enabled TV; Google says it plans to add support for more connected-TV devices later this year. But the service is designed for people for whom the smartphone is their first screen: The YouTube TV apps for iOS and Android will provide access to live TV and DVR recordings anywhere in the U.S. (although access to live local TV channels will be restricted to a subscriber’s home market). To fuel signups, Google is offering a 30-day free trial of YouTube TV, and it’s also offering customers who sign up (and pay for at least one month) a free Google Chromecast adapter while supplies last. YouTube TV includes access to the original programming on YouTube Red, which ordinarily costs $9.99 per month. That includes original series like AwesomenessTV’s comedy “Foursome,” “Rhett & Link’s Buddy System” and “Scare PewDiePie” (although season 2 has been canceled) along with movies including Rooster Teeth’s “Lazer Team,” Smosh’s “Ghostmates,” Lilly Singh’s “A Trip to Unicorn Island,” and a documentary about transgender YouTube star Gigi Gorgeous. YouTube provides up to six accounts, letting customers share the YouTube TV membership with family members or roommates, and each account will receive its own unique recommendations and cloud DVR with no storage limits. Each household can watch up to three streams at a time. Initially, YouTube TV will not sell advertising for the local ad slots granted to pay-TV distributors. (Ads for Google and YouTube products and services will run in those slots.) Down the line, Google’s ad-sales team will handle.

Google Photos details info page shows you the people inside a photo Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/04/05 5:54am PDTApr 5, 2017 35 Plus 1 on G+ 33 Share on Facebook 55 Share on Twitter Total Shares123 Applications Google News Google Photos is really good at recognizing people in a photo and grouping their pics together. It's one feature I've come to rely on to find all the photos I have of specific friends or family members and even photos of "person X and person Y and person Z" together. But there were still a couple of small things missing from Photos' facial recognition like the option to manually tag a person in a pic or the ability to see who Google had recognized in a photo from the photo itself, not their dedicated page. But the latter is now implemented. Actually, it was implemented at some point in the last few versions: I can confirm that it wasn't there in 2.10.0.148909749 but it is live in 2.12.0.151124741, so it was added to Photos sometime between March 13 and 30. Small details aside, this is a simple but nice change. When you tap in the Info icon on any photo while you're browsing your library, you will see a new People section below Description and above Details. In it are thumbnails of all the people Google has recognized in your pics. You can tap the thumbnail to immediately go to that person's dedicated Photos page with all the albums and pictures they're in. Zaher is a very dear friend with an undying love for Android. I'll make him pay for the free publicity. This is a great way to see who Google has tagged in your photos and to jump to individual people's photos without searching for them first. It still doesn't seem to be possible to manually tag someone in your Photos but I'd imagine the function is coming at some point. Google Photos 2.12.0.151124741 has been live on the Play Store for a few days but it's also on APK Mirror if you prefer to grab it there.

Trying to switch to one of these accounts in Google Photos causes the app to crash, and it has been this way since version 2.10.0 Ibrahim Yusuf You're right it crashes on me too makapav I believe, brand accounts/pages were deprecated a long time ago. vwnut13 Creating a new Brand Account is still available on both Google+ and Youtube. Actually, it's not only available, but there is a direct link to create a Brand Account on the Google+ homepage. Suicide_Note Now we just need to be able to manually tag people in a photo. Capt4chris And for search to include shared albums. :-) chris mellor Im on 2.12 and still dont have this feature. johnforamerica Bring back the damn cloud backup icon on individual thumbnails! Since that went away, no way to tell which photos are backed up! (Other than opening each individual photo) Suicide_Note Agreed. It would be nice to have that back. Dennis Ulijn It'll tell you everything's backed up or how many items still need to backed up. I understand not every solution is perfect for everyone, but what would the clutter of a cloud symbol in each photo solve? johnforamerica It would solve exactly what I described. I selectively back up, I don't want everything backed up. With a library of thousands of pictures, you tell me how to figure out which have not yet been backed up... As it functions now, I have NO IDEA what is backed up or not unless I use one of two crappy options: 1) Click on each pic individually to view the cloud icon showing backup status 2) Try to cross reference my device photos with the web version to see "what's missing" It seems pretty clear to me that Google wants to push its users to use the auto backup function, and this is just another step in trying to compel that usage. Dennis Ulijn Okay, fair enough. Thomas Stockx Is this a US only feature? I've been using Google Photo's for ages on my Nexus 6, 6P, and Pixel, but Google is unable to give me search results for any name. Dennis Ulijn Yes. Use a VPN to enable it once, and then it keeps working. You'd have to put in the names yourself though, but after that it keeps adding photos of that person. Florian Reisinger Where to enable it? Dennis Ulijn I think it's the option called 'face grouping'. I use tunnelbear to create a vpn to america. Ailín Ó’S Apparently it's against EU law or something to do that so it's not in Europe. But once you enable it once it works always. rumanuu76 Yep I visited USA, it started working and now always works 😎 towo Still not available in Germany. *sigh* Fruity101079 With a VPN (or chrome extension), fake your location and access google photos , you will be able to enable it. towo Doesn't seem to populate any face matches, though, or does it just take a long time? Jack Smith I need to be able to tag my pets Fruity101079 We still can't change the location of the picture (don't know why, some of them are completely wrong...) thespacecowboy This has been a feature for a long time. Go to Assistant, then Search, then it'll bring a long horizontal list of photos. Click on those, and it will bring all the people it 'knows'. Click on someone it doesn't know and name them, and it'll tag those people in all your photos so you can search them. therealbiglou Yes, we are all aware. This isn't the point of this article. Rita El Khoury That's not what this is. Re-read the post please. thespacecowboy But Rita. Reading is hard! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/1849b9b0acd9cc0f34a50f0fb75f93662013c9cd00535267a4111a9bffb739c5.jpg 4Ui812 Reading is easy , comprehension is hard. Cecil Hardwood This only works for faces/people Google sees. I have lots of photos that for whatever reason Google has not identified any people in them or maybe 1 out of 3. It would be nice to be able to go back and add the ones Google missed. 4Ui812 You're a good looking lady Rita. It's a nice picture , you should use this one as your avatar. Peter Garlinski I'm assuming you're going to get at least a couple good bottles of beer for giving your friend publicity. Rita El Khoury Given how many times I've screenshotted stuff with him in it, I have to ask for at least one Pixel XL :p Vinayak Prabhu This is completely off topic. I noticed that you are using a S7 Edge.. How has it hold up after a year? Is there noticeably lag every now and then? m33d Rita's eyebrows be lookin' "on fleek!" Rita El Khoury Had to Google that. Thanks :) Kevin Chapple But, regrettably STILL not available in the UK.. ANY idea when this will be 'fixed' for the UK? jwildman16 Some others here stated that you can enable a VPN to a U.S. location, start adding names to faces, and then it will continue to do so after the VPN is disconnected. Matthew Merrick Doesn't matter. My Google Photos facial recognition wipes itself every 2 weeks for some godforsaken reason, rendering the service's most useful ability irrelevant, considering it rebuilds at not even one photo per day. Divya Pant Valuable information on Google Photos. Looking forward to seeing your notes posted. The information you have posted is very useful. Keep going on, good stuff.

Silicon Valley has long regarded India, with its population of 1.3 billion people and poor connectivity, as a prime place to test products for emerging markets.YouTube executives said they sought to build a product for Indian users from the ground up rather than releasing a slimmed-down version of their primary app."As we talked to people in the market, they didn't want something that felt like a stripped down version of YouTube – they wanted the full experience," said John Harding, vice president of engineering at YouTube. Due to the frustration of trying to load video at slow Internet speeds, the YouTube team had contemplated showing users a series of images from a video with the audio, like a slideshow. But Indian consumers reacted poorly to the feature. The final design helps users discover videos that trending in their region while minimizing data usage. Users can preview videos before watching to ensure that is what they want. While Reliance Jio's entry has boosted video consumption in India, analyst Neil Shah of Counterpoint Technology Market Research questioned whether YouTube Go would remain popular as cheap data plans become more prevalent. "The only future I see for YouTube Go is for feature phones or basic phones," he wrote in an email. But with 180 million mobile users in India and mobile watch time climbing 400 percent year over year, YouTube has strong momentum in India, Jay Akkad, a product lead at YouTube, said.

As the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Revised Payment Service Directive (PSD2) are implemented across the European Union, the exclusive control of banks and other financial institutions on financial data of their customers is about to end. These new regulations will open the door to almost any company interested in claiming a share, particularly the tech giants, such as Amazon, Facebook, Google. While this may look like a challenge to many, we, as journey science experts, view this as an opportunity for banks to partner with large tech, eCommerce, and fintech enterprises and leverage their expertise at managing customer experiences to revolutionize customer journeys and offer an improved, more holistic experience to their end-users. In this article, we have reviewed how implementation of PSD2 and GDPR will transform the banking and finance industry and result in a new wave of partnerships between banks and ecosystem enterprises to create a win-win situation for everyone, including customers, financial institutions, major tech players, such as Google, Amazon, Facebook, eCommerce companies, as well as small fintech start-ups. How Upcoming Regulations Will Revolutionise the Banking Industry? The new regulations will introduce banks to two new competitive forces — PISP and AISP. PISP or Payment Initiation Service Providers are the merchants who will able to access customers’ accounts. This will allow customers to choose third-party providers to initiate their transactions. Consequently, customers will be able to use Facebook to pay their bills or Google to make a wire transfer. The second type of competitive force, AISP (Account Information Service Provider) are the third-party providers that will aggregate the financial data of customers with more than one bank account to offer a more integrated and improved experience to the users. They will capture all the account information in one place for customers, offering them a more cohesive experience — similar to the services offered by Mint in the US. Depending on the adoption rate, there are two possible scenarios that may result from the implementation of the upcoming regulations. Slow Adoption —The slow adoption of the new solutions by customers due to lack of interest will provide banks the time they need to create improved solutions using their legacy systems. However, because of their relatively limited expertise and knowledge of customer journey as compared to large tech, eCommerce, and fintech enterprises, banks may not face challenges experiencing the true potential of this opportunity. Fast Adoption — In this scenario, tech companies, particularly Google, Facebook, and Amazon, will be able to use their robust, future-proof infrastructure to create new solutions and improve customer experience substantially. A mutually beneficial partnership between banks and these tech companies constitutes the ideal scenario as this will provide an opportunity to analyze and draw insights from the large amounts of data available to banks. This, consequently, will improve customer journey, benefitting everyone involved in the process, including customers, banks, and tech enterprises. An Ecosystems Approach — A Golden Opportunity for Banks Banks cannot afford to ignore the long-term implications of the upcoming regulations, particularly PSD2 and GDPR, if they intend to stay competitive and ahead of the game. Financial institutions should begin with a thorough assessment of their operational models, particularly their customer journey, and embrace technology to build solutions that can ensure them success in the next-generation banking landscape. While the implementation of PSD2 and GDRP may look like a challenge to banks, it is indeed an opportunity to grow new revenue streams by progressing towards an extended ecosystem — an ecosystem that drives value and fosters customer loyalty by allowing users to acquire information and conduct transactions in a ubiquitous manner. This ecosystem consists of three major players: Tech giants, such as Facebook, Google and Amazon Fintech companies eCommerce/Retail Companies Revamping the Customer Journey Today’s well-informed customer demands superior-quality services from providers. They seek to work with brands that offer them just what they want, and when it comes to banking and financial services, trust, convenience, and security are the three primary concerns of customers. Therefore, adapting to the new regulatory requirement and finding success in a more complex industry landscape is all about giving customers choice. Only those institutions that are technically able and culturally willing to build new, improved customer experiences will be able to survive and thrive in the competitive landscape of the banking industry. In order to stay relevant and competitive, banks must offer customers what they desire, and to ensure this they will be required to thoroughly study their customer journey. While banks have immense amounts of data available at their hands, their limited experience in journey science could potentially hold them from unleashing the true potential of a superior-quality customer experience. Perhaps the only and the most viable way banks can overcome this issue is by working in collaboration with the likes of Google, Facebook, Amazon, fintech and eCommerce companies. The partnership of financial institutions with these companies offers exceptional possibilities to improve customers’ satisfaction by offering them a more convenient and value-adding experience. Here are a couple of examples. Commerce Anywhere — Traditionally, when purchasing something from a brick and mortar store, customers are required to get into a queue and pay using their credit or debit card. The implementation of PSD2 will completely revamp this model, allowing customers to pay using any device, be it a watch, a car, or a mobile phone. Integrated Data — Using the services of an ASIP, customers will be able to get a 360-degree view of their expenses, transactions, and other financial data to receive more accurate, data-driven advice from their providers. While these futuristic payment technologies offer great value to the customers, the role of banks in the payment chain remains questionable. Here are a few possible ways through which banks can embrace opportunities of this extended customer journey and stay competitive include: API Economy — To offer an improved experience to customers, banks should look for ways to deliver their core services to the customers at the right place and time. Visa has already taken revolutionary steps in this regard and allows its customers to make payments from any IoT connected device. Best of Breed Customer Experiences — To stay relevant and competitive against the emerging players, banks are required to extend the scope of their offerings and act as a distributor of financial products that their customers prefer. To ensure this, banks will be required to form new partnerships with businesses that can help them create a diverse range of customer journeys. Using Data-Driven Customer Journey Insights to Fuel Success While banks and other financial institutions use data obtained from customers’ interaction with the brand to offer improved services, the scope of this practice is limited to their internal landscape only. The upcoming regulatory changes extend customer journey to include several third-party providers as well. Therefore, in addition to data captured at touchpoints within their own organisation, banks need to focus on customers’ interaction with companies outside their ecosystem and use the information to improve their customer experience. A partnership with Google, Facebook, Amazon, and other companies that excel at user behaviour and customer journey analysis will offer banks an access to top-of-the-line data analytics technologies, allowing them to extract valuable insights from the customer journey and use them to offer personalised services to their customers. Upgrading the Capabilities to Transform Customer Journey Data in Real Time The implementation of GDPR and PSD2 poses two major challenges to banks — the need to stay competitive by offering customers a premium-quality experience and avoid the penalties and sanctions associated with non-compliance. The stringent regulatory requirement of tomorrow demands that businesses build their capability to manage rejections and consents, adopt optimal data governance practices, measure and transform customer journey data into relevant experiences and future-proof their legacy systems and applications to avoid penalties. How Progressive-Thinking Financial Institutions Are Responding to the Situation? The speed and complexity of change experienced by the banking and finance industry is incredible and can only be managed by those who use technology and focus their resources at revamping their customer journey. As a result, progress-thinking, growth-oriented financial institutions have already established partnerships with companies that hold in-depth knowledge of journey science and have a proven track record of creating superior-quality customer experiences. Conclusion PSD2 and GDPR will revolutionise the banking industry. The leading banks of the future will be those that remain successful at crafting a strategic response to these technological and regulatory disruptions. While there is no universal solution to overcome this multi-dimensional ‘power to the people’ opportunity, establishing trusted, value-adding relationships with companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, eCommerce companies as well as fintech start-ups should be the primary focus of banks. This will help banks gain insights into customer behaviour, drive more value by establishing an extended customer journey, and boost customer experience. The upcoming regulatory changes are extending customer journeys beyond the organisational boundaries and to manage this exponential complexity, banks need to build competencies around Journey Science and invest in scalable infrastructure to support their agile journey science teams.

You can run a security check on your account to make sure it's as safe and secure as possible. If you're like a lot of people, your online life is probably heavily tied to Google, from search and Gmail to Google Calendar and YouTube. Your PC, phone, and tablet likely connect to your Google account; maybe you have a Pixel device. How can you keep all of this information in check so no one else can access it? Google aims to help with its Security Checkup, a site that reviews your settings so you're the only one who can view your Google account. Let's see how it works. First, navigate here, which should bring you to the Google Security Checkup page. You'll see four different sections to check, each one devoted to a different area. First, review the section to "Check your recovery information." Here you'll find a recovery phone number and email if you ever forget your Google password or you suspect suspicious activity with your Google account. You may also see a security question. Make sure the phone number and email address are both enabled and correct. You can remove your security question if it still exists, as Google no longer supports this method of recovering your account should you forget your password. When finished with this section, click on the Done button. Check Your Connected Devices Move on to the next section dubbed "Check your connected devices." Make sure that each device is one you used at a certain location and time. You can click on the down arrow next to each device to retrieve further details. If all the information looks valid, click on the "Looks good" button. If you suspect someone else may have accessed your Google account using a specific device, click on the "Something looks wrong" button. Google prompts you to change your password so no one else can tap into your account. When finished, click on the Looks good button. Disable Access for Less Secure Apps At the third section, called "Disable access for less secure apps," you can review the access that apps have to your Google Apps account. The concern here is that some of these apps may use less secure methods to gain such access. Here you have three options: 1) You can turn off access for less secure apps; 2) You can turn on access for less secure apps and take your chances; or 3) You can turn off access for less secure apps and try to find more secure apps as replacements. You'll want to be careful and do some testing here, though. Turning off access for less secure apps will prevent you from using your Gmail account with certain email clients. When finished, click on the Done button. For more, this support site offers further details on the process. Check Your Account Permissions Finally, the fourth section to "Check your account permissions" lets you check any apps, websites, and devices that can connect to your Google account. Review each item to make sure you're comfortable with each one having access to your account. You can click on the down arrow next to each item to view more detailed information. If you spot an item you'd like to cut off, just click on the Remove button. When finished, click on the Done button to complete this section and your Google Privacy Checkup.

Available free of charge on App Store, Google Duo version 9.1 brings out VoIP audio calling along with unspecified bug fixes and product improvements. Audio-only calls are great for those times when you have low bandwidth or poor signal. Google’s created the feature to conserve bandwidth and be reliable on slow connections without eating up too much of your mobile data. Audio-only calls should be especially useful in situations when you’re, say, about to hop on a crowded bus but don’t want passengers to see the person you’re video-chatting with. The app was announced at Google I/O in May of 2016 as Google’s answer to FaceTime and released on App Store and Google Play Store in August 2016. Subscribe to iDownloadBlog on YouTube Duo still suffers from some major drawbacks. For starters, the app lacks support for iOS 10’s CallKit. Without CallKit, you need to acknowledge a notification and then unlock your iPhone to answer a call. Perhaps more important than that, the app still needs group video calling (just like Apple’s FaceTime). Grab Google Duo for free on App Store.

The Vive wasn’t the first commercial VR headset, or even the first commercial high-end headset. But besides the simple Google Cardboard, it was the first major headset released without help from Oculus, proving VR didn’t belong to any one company. It was also the first one to come with sophisticated motion controls, ushering in a completely new class of experiences. In some ways, the Vive’s launch was the moment that VR began feeling like a real industry, rather than a Facebook-backed passion project. A year later, that optimism has turned into something more mature, but less visible. We’ve seen consumer VR milestones since April of 2016, including the launch of PlayStation VR, Google’s Daydream platform, and the Oculus Touch motion controllers. Microsoft announced an upcoming line of Windows Holographic VR headsets. Samsung said it had shipped 5 million Gear VR headsets at the start of 2017, and PlayStation VR exceeded expectations by selling 915,000 headsets in four months. All the major VR platforms built out their launch catalogs, and virtual reality video maintained a steady presence on YouTube and Facebook. VR arcades began opening in cities around the world. And virtual reality social spaces like BigScreen, AltspaceVR, and a number of multiplayer games have drawn modest but enthusiastic user bases. For all that, there have been disappointments. The Oculus Rift launch was staggered by a component shortage, and as expected, desktop VR headset sales were far lower than those of PlayStation VR. Oculus shipped an estimated 243,000 Rifts in 2016, and HTC shipped an estimated 420,000 Vives. Daydream is still only compatible with a handful of devices. Virtual reality arcades are here, but they’re still in the novelty period. And in a major symbolic blow, Oculus co-founder Palmer Luckey removed himself from the public eye after political controversy, and left Facebook entirely last week. “From a market adoption perspective, VR has more or less delivered on expectations, but the sentiment ... has certainly changed.” There are other, less tangible shifts as well. Virtual reality is no longer an exclusive, theoretical technology, but it hasn’t seen mainstream adoption either. In the Gartner Hype Cycle, this might be called the “trough of disillusionment” — the moment where people decide a great new technology isn’t delivering on its promises. Businesses and research institutions have been using VR for training, design, and even medical treatment for decades. But for everyday consumers, it’s of limited use, particularly because of its price — robust experiences require expensive hardware, while cheap VR like Cardboard gets old fast. Unsurprisingly, though, some of the VR community’s most dedicated members don’t think the medium is in long-term trouble. “I think the current ‘trough of disillusionment’ sentiment that seems to be pervading the industry (or at least investor panels at conferences) is a bit unfounded,” says Eric Romo, CEO of AltspaceVR. “From a market adoption perspective, VR has more or less delivered on expectations, but the sentiment around that market progress has certainly changed.” Romo describes the current dip as the “Palm Treo” era of virtual reality. The current headsets are pretty good, but “they all have tragic flaws,” he says. Desktop VR is too complicated, and console VR monopolizes your living room, while mobile VR isn’t full-featured enough — and no midrange headset works with the iPhone, dramatically limiting its user base. Photo by James Bareham / The Verge Still, some people are already making a living off the medium. Longtime VR journalist Kent Bye, who characterizes VR as “still in the ‘cinema of attraction’ experimental phase,” says that the industry hasn’t figured out a reliable way for big projects to make money. “But a number of small indie VR teams have been able to break even,” he says. One success story is Owlchemy Labs, creator of Vive launch title Job Simulator — Owlchemy co-founder Alex Schwartz says the company made $3 million in sales last year. Bigger names have also declared some victories. CCP, the studio behind EVE Online, has sold over 500,000 copies of its cross-platform game EVE Gunjack. That’s not a huge number compared to a best-selling mobile or console game, but it breaks out of the “niche” category. “[VR] will take a significant amount of time to approach widespread consumer adoption,” says Schwartz. But compared to some past technological breakthroughs — Schwartz cites the VCR as one example — it’s a “resounding, incredible success.” “We can’t afford to be lazy.” Denny Unger of Cloudhead Games, the company behind episodic Vive launch title The Gallery, is still cautious. “The general public is clamoring for longer, more engaging, AAA experiences in VR while simultaneously accusing it of being a gimmick,” he says. “After one year on market, we have the velocity, but we have to keep pushing for quality of experience to make it over the hill. We’re still in a phase which demands we make the general public ‘true believers.’ We can’t afford to be lazy.” Unlike in 2016, where new hardware launches set a clear course for VR’s development, it’s unclear what the rest of 2017 will bring. Self-contained headsets are on the horizon, but they may not hit the market until 2018. We don’t know what big players like Google and Apple will be doing, and Oculus’ latest project — a standalone device known as Santa Cruz — is just a prototype. The Gear VR is getting a modest upgrade with a new controller, but it still has clear shortcomings. Progress on Daydream is moving slowly, if it hasn’t outright stalled. Until then, 2017 could well be a productive but low-key year for virtual reality. For the first time since 2013, there’s no more waiting for VR to “arrive.” It’s finally here — just figuring out how to get a foothold.

IBM’s cloud adds support for Nvidia’s fastest GPUs yet Posted 14 hours ago by Frederic Lardinois (@fredericl) 0 SHARES Next Story Taser rebrands as Axon and offers free body cameras to any police department IBM today announced that users on its Bluemix cloud will soon be able to add two Nvidia Tesla P100 accelerator cards to their bare metal servers. The company says this feature will launch later this month and, when it’s live, IBM will likely be the first major cloud provider to offer support for these chips, which can provide up to 4.7 teraflops of double-precision performance and 16 gigabytes of memory. There is still a chance that Google could beat IBM to the market, though. Late last year, Google also announced that it would support Nvidia’s newest GPUs early this year, but we haven’t heard when exactly the company plans to launch this feature. We asked Google for an updated timeline but haven’t heard back yet. AWS, too, offers GPU support, of course, and its machines can be outfitted with up to 16 GPUs (those are the older K80 cards, though 16 of those obviously offer a lot of raw computing power, too). Microsoft’s Azure offers a similar setup with support for up to 4 of Nvidia’s slightly older GPUs. The Nvidia Tesla P100 GPUs are Nvidia’s fastest yet, and have been optimized for deep learning applications. In addition to machine learning, though, there are also plenty of other high-performance computing applications that now make use of GPUs to speed up their processing. “As the AI era takes hold, demand continues to surge for our GPU-accelerated computing platform in the cloud,” said Ian Buck, Nvidia’s general manager for accelerated computing, in today’s announcement. “These new IBM Cloud offerings will provide users with near-instant access to the most powerful GPU technologies to date — enabling them to create applications to address complex problems that were once unsolvable.” All of this rush to bring the newest and fastest GPUs to the cloud goes to show how these big cloud platforms are now in a race to offer their customers the fastest machines to run their deep learning and artificial intelligence applications. Offering basic cloud computing capabilities, after all, is quickly becoming a commodity, but at least for the time being, the major players can still differentiate their services by offering better support for GPUs — until that, of course, also becomes table stakes again. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase IBM Founded 1911 Overview IBM is a global technology and innovation company headquartered in Armonk, NY.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 5 April 2017 by Military News Chowbotics Introduces Sally the Salad Robot Innovative technology provides fresh, healthy and hygienic food in a fun way REDWOOD CITY, Calif., April 5, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- World, meet Sally. Sally, meet world. Sally the Salad Robot creates custom salads with up to 21 seasonal ingredients – replenished daily – in less than a minute, any time of day. Developed by food robotics company Chowbotics, Sally is intuitive and easy to use. Users place a bowl beneath the dispenser, make selections on a touchscreen interface and watch as Sally's canisters shift to drop each ingredient in, one by one. Charlie Ayers, "the chef who fed Google," is Executive Chef. He created Sally's signature salads and oversees ingredient selection. "Having spent my career in Silicon Valley, the intersection of food and technology has always fascinated and inspired me," says Charlie. "I am proud to collaborate with the Chowbotics team to bring robotics to food service. This is the future." Charlie tapped his protégé, Kelly Olazar, to lead the day-to-day as Chowbotics' Chef de Cuisine. Kelly previously worked as an Executive Chef at Google's campus and as a Culinary Services Manager at Charlie's restaurant, Calafia Café. She has a background in nutrition and specializes in creating food that keeps people energized and healthy. Sally's patent-pending canister system protects the integrity of the ingredients by keeping them fresh and sanitary. Precise calorie counts also allow users to build salads that suit their nutritional needs. Sally's small footprint is another bonus – she measures just 31.7" x 33.2". Sally allows for thousands of different combinations of ingredients or users can choose from the following: Sally's Salad: Crisp romaine served with ripe cherry tomatoes, cucumbers, carrots, California walnuts, Parmesan cheese and house-made black peppercorn ranch Power Chow Salad: Hearty kale served with carrots, cabbage, sundried cranberries, Parmesan cheese, California walnuts and tangy honey mustard vinaigrette Chicken Bot Salad: Seared chicken breast served with crisp romaine, cherry tomatoes, red onions, Parmesan cheese and house-made black peppercorn ranch Silicon Valley Salad: Seared chicken breast served with hearty kale, mixed bell peppers, Kalamata olives, cucumbers, crunchy wonton chips and tangy honey mustard vinaigrette California Love Salad: Hearty kale served with ripe cherry tomatoes, mixed bell peppers, cucumbers, Kalamata olives and croutons One of the first locations to pilot Sally is Galvanize, a tech-centric shared workspace. "At Galvanize, we are committed to investing in technology and education that is accessible to anyone with the determination and drive, ability and aptitude to learn the skills they need to not only transform their lives but also their communities," says Jim Deters, CEO. "That is why we invested in Chowbotics through our venture arm and are thrilled to be one of the first to deploy Sally at our San Francisco campus. This innovative technology is creating additional options for people to access nutrition and enhance productivity while they learn, work and grow." Sally is available for pre-orders now. Target locations include cafeterias, restaurants, hotels and other commercial venues.   SOURCE Chowbotics CategoriesUncategorized TagsComputer/ Electronics, Consumer Electronics, Food & beverages, New Products/Services, Restaurants, Retail Post navigation Previous PostPrevious Ceiling-Mounted Supply Pendants with Column Market: Business Opportunities, Current Trends, Market Forecast & Global Industry Analysis by 2022 Next PostNext Convenient Camping Cooler Market: Market Growth Factors, Applications, Regional Analysis, Key Players and Forecasts by 2022 Search Recent Posts International Automotive Radar Sensors Market to Grow at CAGR of 20.50% by 2017-2021: Analysis, Growth, Drivers, Challenges, Trend, Forecast, & Vendors Analysis Global Linear Halogen Lamp Market Key Players, Product and Production Information analysis and forecast to 2021 Global Linear Halogen Lamp Market Key Players, Product and Production Information analysis and forecast to 2021 Worldwide Gallium Arsenide Components Market by 2021: Focus on (Companies, Opportunities, Challenges, Drivers, Growth, Countries, Revenue, Forecast) Governor Discusses Changes to Put Illinois Back on Track Business Directory Business Contacts Proudly powered by WordPress

Google Photos details info page shows you the people inside a photo Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/04/05 5:54am PDTApr 5, 2017 35 Plus 1 on G+ 33 Share on Facebook 55 Share on Twitter Total Shares123 Applications Google News Google Photos is really good at recognizing people in a photo and grouping their pics together. It's one feature I've come to rely on to find all the photos I have of specific friends or family members and even photos of "person X and person Y and person Z" together. But there were still a couple of small things missing from Photos' facial recognition like the option to manually tag a person in a pic or the ability to see who Google had recognized in a photo from the photo itself, not their dedicated page. But the latter is now implemented. Actually, it was implemented at some point in the last few versions: I can confirm that it wasn't there in 2.10.0.148909749 but it is live in 2.12.0.151124741, so it was added to Photos sometime between March 13 and 30. Small details aside, this is a simple but nice change. When you tap in the Info icon on any photo while you're browsing your library, you will see a new People section below Description and above Details. In it are thumbnails of all the people Google has recognized in your pics. You can tap the thumbnail to immediately go to that person's dedicated Photos page with all the albums and pictures they're in. Zaher is a very dear friend with an undying love for Android. I'll make him pay for the free publicity. This is a great way to see who Google has tagged in your photos and to jump to individual people's photos without searching for them first. It still doesn't seem to be possible to manually tag someone in your Photos but I'd imagine the function is coming at some point. Google Photos 2.12.0.151124741 has been live on the Play Store for a few days but it's also on APK Mirror if you prefer to grab it there.

Trying to switch to one of these accounts in Google Photos causes the app to crash, and it has been this way since version 2.10.0 Ibrahim Yusuf You're right it crashes on me too makapav I believe, brand accounts/pages were deprecated a long time ago. vwnut13 Creating a new Brand Account is still available on both Google+ and Youtube. Actually, it's not only available, but there is a direct link to create a Brand Account on the Google+ homepage. Suicide_Note Now we just need to be able to manually tag people in a photo. Capt4chris And for search to include shared albums. :-) chris mellor Im on 2.12 and still dont have this feature. johnforamerica Bring back the damn cloud backup icon on individual thumbnails! Since that went away, no way to tell which photos are backed up! (Other than opening each individual photo) Suicide_Note Agreed. It would be nice to have that back. Dennis Ulijn It'll tell you everything's backed up or how many items still need to backed up. I understand not every solution is perfect for everyone, but what would the clutter of a cloud symbol in each photo solve? johnforamerica It would solve exactly what I described. I selectively back up, I don't want everything backed up. With a library of thousands of pictures, you tell me how to figure out which have not yet been backed up... As it functions now, I have NO IDEA what is backed up or not unless I use one of two crappy options: 1) Click on each pic individually to view the cloud icon showing backup status 2) Try to cross reference my device photos with the web version to see "what's missing" It seems pretty clear to me that Google wants to push its users to use the auto backup function, and this is just another step in trying to compel that usage. Dennis Ulijn Okay, fair enough. Thomas Stockx Is this a US only feature? I've been using Google Photo's for ages on my Nexus 6, 6P, and Pixel, but Google is unable to give me search results for any name. Dennis Ulijn Yes. Use a VPN to enable it once, and then it keeps working. You'd have to put in the names yourself though, but after that it keeps adding photos of that person. Florian Reisinger Where to enable it? Dennis Ulijn I think it's the option called 'face grouping'. I use tunnelbear to create a vpn to america. Ailín Ó’S Apparently it's against EU law or something to do that so it's not in Europe. But once you enable it once it works always. rumanuu76 Yep I visited USA, it started working and now always works 😎 towo Still not available in Germany. *sigh* Fruity101079 With a VPN (or chrome extension), fake your location and access google photos , you will be able to enable it. towo Doesn't seem to populate any face matches, though, or does it just take a long time? Jack Smith I need to be able to tag my pets Fruity101079 We still can't change the location of the picture (don't know why, some of them are completely wrong...) thespacecowboy This has been a feature for a long time.

Click on someone it doesn't know and name them, and it'll tag those people in all your photos so you can search them. therealbiglou Yes, we are all aware. This isn't the point of this article.

Cecil Hardwood This only works for faces/people Google sees. I have lots of photos that for whatever reason Google has not identified any people in them or maybe 1 out of 3. It would be nice to be able to go back and add the ones Google missed. 4Ui812 You're a good looking lady Rita. It's a nice picture , you should use this one as your avatar. Peter Garlinski I'm assuming you're going to get at least a couple good bottles of beer for giving your friend publicity. Rita El Khoury Given how many times I've screenshotted stuff with him in it, I have to ask for at least one Pixel XL :p Vinayak Prabhu This is completely off topic. I noticed that you are using a S7 Edge.. How has it hold up after a year? Is there noticeably lag every now and then? m33d Rita's eyebrows be lookin' "on fleek!" Rita El Khoury Had to Google that. Thanks :) Kevin Chapple But, regrettably STILL not available in the UK.. ANY idea when this will be 'fixed' for the UK? jwildman16 Some others here stated that you can enable a VPN to a U.S. location, start adding names to faces, and then it will continue to do so after the VPN is disconnected. Matthew Merrick Doesn't matter. My Google Photos facial recognition wipes itself every 2 weeks for some godforsaken reason, rendering the service's most useful ability irrelevant, considering it rebuilds at not even one photo per day.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 5 April 2017 by Military News Wireless Audio Devices Market – Launch of Better Functionality and Aesthetics to Boost Sales of Wireless Audio Devices Albany, NY — (SBWIRE) — 04/05/2017 — Until 2014-2015, the unit shipment of sound bar audio devices and wireless speakers held the lion’s share in the global wireless audio devices market. However, Transparency Market Research’s (TMR) new study finds that the persistently increasing demand for Bluetooth speakers in lower-end of the price spectrum and the rising demand for multiroom audio at the premium end will usher in new opportunities for the market. The most prominent players in the market including Sony, Bose, LG, Samsung, and Denon are vying to take on this rapidly growing segment that was earlier dominated by Sonos. Attracted by the prevailing prospects, technology firms such as Google are also aggressively investing in wireless audio devices. The competition is set to build up as Google pits its Google Cast against the likes of Apple Airplay, says TMR. Browse Market Research Report @ http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/wireless-audio-devices-market.html The demand for wireless audio devices is expected to rise in response to the increasing adoption of wireless technology enabled products, projects TMR. The compact design of these products and convenience they offer will further boost their proliferation worldwide. Audio technologies such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Airplay, and WiSA are now used for the transmission of audio files between these devices. Prospects for Bluetooth-enabled Wireless Audio Devices Seem Robust Wireless audio devices with built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth play the music sourced from a PC or other portable devices. „Being independent of speakers’ location, these devices score high on convenience,” said a TMR analyst. Due to the impact of these factors, the sales of wireless audio devices are expected to increase in the forthcoming years. The TMR analyst further states that „Among various wireless audio technologies available in the market, Bluetooth accounted for a major share in the home audio shipments in 2015.” „The Wi-Fi technology on the other hand is integrated into room speakers such as DNLA and Airplay. In the next few years the technology will also make inroads into mobile speakers and sound bars,” he added. Technological Limitations May Inhibit Proliferation of Wireless Audio Devices Despite witnessing favorable opportunities, the incompatibility of the Bluetooth technology with high resolution uncompressed audio files limits the deployment of wireless audio devices. Also the vulnerability of the sound quality in Wi-Fi technology to the ambient noise also negatively impacts the adoption of wireless audio devices, particularly in the household sector. Nevertheless, the leisure and hospitality industries exhibit ample opportunities for the global wireless audio devices market. The market is also expected to gain impetus from the launch of the latest technologies. Make an Enquiry @ http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=S&rep_id=7358 By product, Bluetooth speakers accounted for the largest share of the market in 2014. Regionally, the U.S. has been exhibiting the most attractive prospects for enterprises operating in the global wireless audio devices market. Considering robust demand reported by developing nations such as India and China, APAC is expected to provide vendors attractive opportunities to capitalize on during the forecast period. TMR has pegged the value of the global wireless audio devices market at US$9.04bn in 2014. Exhibiting a CAGR of 1.5%, the market is projected to reach US$10.12 bn by the end of 2024.

A 17-page paper gives a deep dive into the TPU and benchmarks showing that it is at least 15 times faster and delivers 30 times more performance/watt than the merchant chips. In May, Google announced the ASIC designed to accelerate inference jobs for a wide range of applications on its data center servers. Now it is providing a first in-depth look at the chip and its performance in a paper to be presented at a computer architecture conference in June. The paper gives a deep look into both the accelerator and Google’s diverse neural network workloads, suggesting that engineers have much more to learn about the rapidly expanding field. “We want to hire good engineers, so we want engineers to know that we are doing high-quality work, and we want to let cloud customers know our capabilities,” said Norman P. Jouppi, a distinguished hardware engineer who led a team of more than 70 engineers that contributed to the TPU. One of the contributors on the project was retired U.C. Berkeley professor and veteran processor architect, David Patterson, who will present the paper today (April 5) at a gathering of engineers in Silicon Valley. Google also posted a blog on the chip written by Jouppi. The chip is still being used in Google’s data centers today. Jouppi declined to give any details about how broadly it is deployed or any planned enhancements. The 40-W TPU is a 28-nm chip running at 700 MHz, designed to accelerate Google’s TensorFlow algorithm. Its main logic unit packs 65,536 8-bit multiply-accumulate units and a 24-Mbyte cache, delivering 92 tera-operations/second. In benchmarks in 2015 using Google’s machine-learning jobs, the TPU ran 15 to 30 times faster and delivered 30 to 80 times better performance per watt than Intel’s Haswell server CPU and Nvidia’s K80 GPU. “The relative incremental-performance/watt — which was our company’s justification for a custom ASIC — is 41 to 83 for the TPU, which lifts the TPU to 25 to 29 times the performance/watt of the GPU,” the paper reports. The 2015 tests used a 22-nm, 18-core Intel Haswell E5-2699 v3 CPU with a 145-W TDP running at 2.3 GHz. The Nvidia GPU was a 150-W K80 running at up to 875 MHz. Next step: A look inside the TPU The TPU (stars) outpaced Intel's Haswell (circles) and K80 (triangles) in a range of neural network inference jobs.

Ron Amadeo - Apr 5, 2017 4:10 pm UTC Enlarge / Google Home + Google Wi-Fi = Whatever this new product is. Ron Amadeo reader comments 41 Share this story Google's home strategy is a little conflicted right now. Aside from the TV-focused Chromecast, Google's strategy revolves around Google Home, a Google Assistant voice appliance and speaker, and Google Wifi, a mesh Wi-Fi router. Google's sales pitch for these two devices is pretty similar: multiple Google Home boxes will work together to give you music and voice commands in every room, while multiple Google Wifi boxes will work together to give you a strong Wi-Fi signal throughout the whole house. Put the two together and Google wants you to have two boxes in (almost) every room. Who wants that? Further ReadingGoogle Home review: A step forward for hotwords, a step backward in capabilityA new report from The Information (subscription required) claims that Google is working on fixing this. The company is reportedly mulling over "a version of its Google Home intelligent speaker with built-in mesh Wi-Fi networking"—a combo box containing Google Home and Google Wifi. That's a speaker, a voice-command system, and a Wi-Fi router all in one box. Such a combo box would represent a singular device from Google to put in every room. This makes a lot more sense than the current sales pitch. The report doesn't say much more than that and doesn't have offer anything on price. Both Google Home and Google Wifi cost $130 each, with Google Wifi available in a three-pack bundle for $300. A combo product would certainly help differentiate Google Home from its mortal enemy, the Amazon Echo, and would help Google Wifi stand out from the growing range of mesh Wi-Fi routers.

Cade Metz Business Date of Publication: 04.05.17. 04.05.17 Time of Publication: 12:03 pm. 12:03 pm Building an AI Chip Saved Google From Building a Dozen New Data Centers Google server racks loaded with TPUsGoogle Google operates what is surely the largest computer network on Earth, a system that comprises custom-built, warehouse-sized data centers spanning 15 locations in four continents. But about six years ago, as the company embraced a new form of voice recognition on Android phones, its engineers worried that this network wasn’t nearly big enough. If each of the world’s Android phones used the new Google voice search for just three minutes a day, these engineers realized, the company would need twice as many data centers. At that time, Google was just beginning to drive its voice recognition services with deep neural networks, complex mathematical systems that can learn particular tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data. In recent years, this form of machine learning has rapidly reinvented not just voice recognition, but image recognition, machine translation, internet search, and more. In moving to this method, Google saw error rates drop a good 25 percent. But the shift required a lot of extra horsepower. Rather than double its data center footprint, Google instead built its own computer chip specifically for running deep neural networks, called the Tensor Processing Unit, or TPU. “It makes sense to have a solution there that is much more energy efficient,” says Norm Jouppi, one of the more than 70 engineers who worked on the chip. In fact, the TPU outperforms standard processors by 30 to 80 times in the TOPS/Watt measure, a metric of efficiency. Google A Neural Network Niche Google first revealed this custom processor last May, but gave few details. Now, Jouppi and the rest of his team have a released a paper detailing the project, explaining how the chip operates and the particular problems it solves. Google uses the chip solely for executing neural networks, running them the moment when, say, someone barks a command into their Android phone. It’s not used to train the neural network beforehand. But as Jouppi explains, even that still saves the company quite a bit. It didn’t have to build, say, an extra 15 data centers. More Chips Cade Metz Google’s Making Its Own Chips Now. Time for Intel to Freak Out Cade Metz How AI Is Shaking Up the Chip Market Cade Metz Microsoft Bets Its Future on a Reprogrammable Computer Chip Cade Metz Intel Looks to a New Chip to Power the Coming Age of AI The chip also represents a much larger shift in the world of computer processors. As Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and other internet giants build more and more services using deep neural networks, they’ve all needed specialized chips both for training and executing these AI models. Most companies train their models using GPUs, chips that were originally designed for rendering graphics for games and other highly visual applications but are also suited to the kind of math at the heart of neural networks. And some, including Microsoft and Baidu, the Chinese internet giant, use alternative chips when executing these models as well, much as Google does with the TPU. The difference is that Google built its own chip from scratch. As a way of reducing the cost and improving the efficiency of its vast online empire, the company builds much of its own data center hardware, including servers and networking gear. Now, it has pushed this work all the way down to individual processors. In the process, it has also shifted the larger market for chips. Since Google designs its own, for instance, it’s not buying other processors to accommodate the extra load from neural networks. Google going in-house even for specialized tasks has wide implications; like Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft, it’s among the biggest chip buyers on Earth. Meanwhile the big chip makers—including, most notably, Intel—are building a new breed of processor in an effort to move the market back in their direction. Focused But Versatile Jouppi joined Google in late 2013 to work on what became the TPU, after serving as a hardware researcher at places like HP and DEC, a kind of breeding ground for many of Google’s top hardware designers. He says the company considered moving its neural networks onto FPGAs, the kind of programmable chip that Microsoft uses. That route wouldn’t have taken as long, and the adaptability of FPGAs means the company could reprogram the chips for other tasks as needed. But tests indicated that these chips wouldn’t provide the necessary speed boost. “There’s a lot overhead with programmable chips,” he explains. “Our analysis showed that an FPGA wouldn’t be any faster than a GPU.” In the end, the team settled on an ASIC, a chip built from the ground up for a particular task. According to Jouppi, because Google designed the chip specifically for neural nets, it can run them 15 to 30 times faster than general purpose chips built with similar manufacturing techniques. That said, the chip is suited to any breed of neural network—at least as they exist today—including everything from the convolutional neural networks used in image recognition to the long-short-term-memory network used to recognize voice commands. “It’s not wired to one model,” he says. Google has used the TPU for a good two years, applying it to everything from image recognition to machine translation to AlphaGo, the machine that cracked the ancient game of Go last spring. Not bad—especially considering all the data construction it helped avoid in the process. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. chips google processors Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News.

Name: Subject: Message: Rumors about the next Google Home speaker claim it will add a mesh Wi-Fi router Newsby John Callaham15 hours ago 4 182 19 The Google Home connected speaker has been on sale for less than six months, but a new report claims the company is already working hard on the next version of the product. The story says the new version might include an embedded mesh Wi-Fi router inside. See also: The complete list of services with Google Home support 3 weeks ago The report comes from The Information (paid subscription required), via unnamed sources. It says that Google is considering adding the Wi-Fi router hardware inside the next Home speaker so it can offer consumers a more complete connected home device. The company already sells a separate mesh-based Google Wi-Fi router that launched in December 2016 in the US, a month after Google Home launched in November 2016. Both products will officially go on sale in the UK starting tomorrow, April 6. So far, Google has yet to reveal sales numbers for either device. In fact, the story claims that at one point, the company’s plan was to launch Google Wi-Fi with a speaker, a microphone and access to Google Assistant. However, the company decided against that move, fearing it would confuse customers. Wi-Fi router hardware in Google Home would make it stand out from its competitors, including Amazon's Echo speakers. Another reason for adding Wi-Fi router hardware inside a future version of Google Home is that it will allow owners to get faster responses to the speaker’s Google Assistant digital AI service. It would also make the speaker stand out against its competitors, most notably with Amazon’s Echo family of speakers. If  this story is accurate, adding a mesh Wi-Fi router inside a Google Home speaker could make it pretty expensive. Both Google Home and Google Wi-Fi are priced at $129 each in the US. The Information’s story did not offer any pricing info or a release date for the next version of Google Home. While adding that kind of hardware would indeed make Google Home a more complete internet connected device, most households that would be interested in such a product already have a Wi-Fi router installed. If it is to be successful, the speaker would have to have the right price point, no matter how well the mesh Wi-Fi router works.

Image Credit: Screenshot Google today is providing more information about its tensor processing unit (TPU), the server chip that it uses in house to perform artificial intelligence (AI) computing workloads more efficiently. Google has been using TPUs internally since 2015. The company disclosed the existence of the TPU last year but hadn’t said anything more about the technology until now. In addition to publishing a paper on the TPU, Google’s David Patterson is also giving a talk about it today at a National Academy of Engineering event in Mountain View, California. Patterson is one of the paper’s whopping 75 co-authors. Google relies on TPUs for the second of two phases when operating artificial neural networks. First, Google trains the neural networks on lots of data, typically on servers that are accelerated with graphics processing units (GPUs). After that, Google has begun using TPUs to more efficiently make inferences about new data. Google says that compares very well with inference performance directly on GPUs or basic x86 chips. “Despite low utilization for some applications, the TPU is on average about 15X-30X faster than its contemporary GPU or CPU,” the authors write in the paper. Those contemporary systems are specifically Nvidia’s Tesla K80 GPU and Intel’s Haswell-generation Xeon E5-2699 v3 chips, the latter of which can be the underlying platform for a TPU. For the past five years, GPUs from companies like AMD and Nvidia have become the default infrastructure for economical deep learning, and Google has contributed to that. But Google, Microsoft, and other companies have also explored other types of chips, including field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), for various AI workloads. Google’s project is notable for its origins, as well as its uses in production; the system is already powering Google Image Search, Google Photos, and the Google Cloud Vision application programming interface (API), among other things, Google distinguished hardware engineer Norm Jouppi wrote in a blog post. One TPU has 3.5 times more memory on chip than a K80, while also being smaller, the authors write. And performance per watt is 30-80 times better. Currently Google can pack two TPUs into a single server, but that’s not to say that it won’t build other hardware systems that lead to better performance or economics. Google has embraced artificial neural networks more strongly than many other technology companies, and in 2013 the company concluded that they were so popular that their use could double the computational demands of its data centers. Doing it all on standard chips would have been unbearably expensive. And so Google began working on its own technology with an eye toward getting cost-performance that was 10 times better than GPUs. “Rather than be tightly integrated with a CPU, to reduce the chances of delaying deployment, the TPU was designed to be a coprocessor on the PCIe I/O bus, allowing it to plug into existing servers just as a GPU does,” the authors write. “Moreover, to simplify hardware design and debugging, the host server sends TPU instructions for it to execute rather than fetching them itself. Hence, the TPU is closer in spirit to an FPU (floating-point unit) coprocessor than it is to a GPU. The goal was to run whole inference models in the TPU to reduce interactions with the host CPU and to be flexible enough to match the NN needs of 2015 and beyond, instead of just what was required for 2013 NNs.” Typically, running code on the TPU is as simple as using the Google-led TensorFlow open source deep learning framework, the authors write. For much more detail on the TPU, read the full paper here. ABOUT CONTACT CAREERS ADVERTISE Terms of Service Privacy Policy © 2017 VentureBeat. All rights reserved.

Khatri had moved the high court challenging the May 2011 decision of the arbitrator, who had held that googlee.In, the domain name registered by him, was deceptively similar to the one registered by Google. Interestingly, Justice Muralidhar in his judgment has put a screenshot of the home page of googlee.In to substantiate the claim of the parties and did not find any merit in the petitioner's submission that 'Googlee.In' was not similar to 'Google'.

The court said that the petitioner was rightly stopped in his tracks by the arbitrator from continuing with his "misadventure". "He could not have hoped to get away with exploiting Google's goodwill and reputation by merely adding an 'e' to its domain name. Google rightly cried foul. The arbitrator declared Khatri out... Khatri stands bowled by his own 'googlee'," the judge added. In 2007, Khatri applied to the .IN Registry, run by National Internet Exchange of India (NIXI) to register the domain name of his website, googlee.In. Before opening .IN domain names for registration to the general public, NIXI began with a sunrise period, during which trademark holders are allowed to register domain names which are similar to their own. Khatri got his domain name registered in 2008 and in 2010, it was renewed up till 2020. Google Inc., US, in September 2010 issued cease and desist notice against him in 2010, claiming that apart from copying their trademark, his website also had a nearly identical writing style, font, colour scheme and layout. After their legal notices to Khatri failed to get any reply, Google filed a complaint against him under the .IN Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (INDRP). Following which, the arbitrator held in favour of Google, since Khatri had offered no shot, failing to offer any explanation for the fact that his website was virtually identical to Google's, hence, the cancellation of googlee.In was directed. In the challenge to this decision, Khatri, who claimed to be the sole proprietor of M/s TCI Web Gate, had made several points on privity of contract and natural justice.

Google Photos’ algorithm for recognizing who is in your photos in uncannily good. Whether you have 100 or 10,000 pictures, it can quickly scan them and sort them by the people in your life, and it rarely misses. Now in the latest update, Google makes using this feature even better. As first spotted by Android Police, Google Photos now shows you everyone it recognizes inside a photo before heading to a specific person’s page. When you’re browsing your main library, you can now tap on the info icon to view details about a particular pic, and it will still show you all of the people who has been tagged under a new People tab. Then, you need only tap on their picture to be taken to a page with any other photos they’re in. You still can’t apply manual tags, and to remove a person that Google has recognized you’ll still need to go to their specific page, but the change will certainly help with navigation and organization of larger photo libraries. It’s unclear whether Google has added any new tricks to its algorithm as part of the change, but we don’t have many complaints in that department. The new feature seems to only be live in the Android app and not on the web, so if you’re not seeing it, be sure to side-load the Google-signed APK from APKMirror. Picture perfect: We love Google Photos. Not only is it an amazing free service, but Google continues to add features and make tweaks that only enhance the experience. This new change is a small one for sure, but it shows just how far ahead of the competition Google is with Photos. While other services are still struggling to perfect their recognition algorithms, Google is adding features that better incorporate theirs into our daily lives.

The security flaw could let attackers who are in WiFi range inject and run code on your smartphone. Apple patches critical Broadcom WiFi chip security flaw in iOS 10.3.1 The security flaw was detailed by Google Project Zero security research pro Gal Beniamini who said it impacts the iPhone 5 and newer, along with Google’s Nexus and several Samsung Galaxy models. Since Broadcom’s WiFi system on a chip, or SoC, is used in so many mobile devices it’s a safe bet other smartphones and tablets are vulnerable, too. According to Beniamini, there are two variants of the attack involving stack buffer overflows related to wireless roaming support. Another attack involves Tunneled Direct Link Setup, or TLDS, which allows devices on a network to share data directly with each other instead of first sending it back through the WiFi base station. Considering how far WiFi signals travel, it’s possible hackers could target iPhones, iPads, and other mobile devices in your home simply by driving down the street and looking for wireless signals. Coffee shops, stores, and other public places will make good target areas, too. The security flaw falls squarely in Broadcom’s lap since it designed the WiFi chip and its embedded software. According to Beniamini’s research Broadcom’s WiFi SoC “lacks basic exploit mitigations, such as stack cookies, safe unlinking,” and also doesn’t use the available memory protection features. Luckily, Apple patched Broadcom’s security flaw with the iOS 10.3.1 update and Google released a similar Android update on Monday, too. The flaw underscores how difficult it is for device makers to stay on top of security issues because some components—like Broadcom’s popular WiFi SoC—are out of their control. Broadcom says security in new versions of its WiFi SoC is better, and more are being evaluated. Still, it kind of sucks that Broadcom didn’t implement better security from the beginning.

Google Photos details info page shows you the people inside a photo Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/04/05 5:54am PDTApr 5, 2017 35 Plus 1 on G+ 33 Share on Facebook 55 Share on Twitter Total Shares123 Applications Google News Google Photos is really good at recognizing people in a photo and grouping their pics together. It's one feature I've come to rely on to find all the photos I have of specific friends or family members and even photos of "person X and person Y and person Z" together. But there were still a couple of small things missing from Photos' facial recognition like the option to manually tag a person in a pic or the ability to see who Google had recognized in a photo from the photo itself, not their dedicated page. But the latter is now implemented. Actually, it was implemented at some point in the last few versions: I can confirm that it wasn't there in 2.10.0.148909749 but it is live in 2.12.0.151124741, so it was added to Photos sometime between March 13 and 30. Small details aside, this is a simple but nice change. When you tap in the Info icon on any photo while you're browsing your library, you will see a new People section below Description and above Details. In it are thumbnails of all the people Google has recognized in your pics. You can tap the thumbnail to immediately go to that person's dedicated Photos page with all the albums and pictures they're in. Zaher is a very dear friend with an undying love for Android. I'll make him pay for the free publicity. This is a great way to see who Google has tagged in your photos and to jump to individual people's photos without searching for them first. It still doesn't seem to be possible to manually tag someone in your Photos but I'd imagine the function is coming at some point. Google Photos 2.12.0.151124741 has been live on the Play Store for a few days but it's also on APK Mirror if you prefer to grab it there.

Trying to switch to one of these accounts in Google Photos causes the app to crash, and it has been this way since version 2.10.0 Ibrahim Yusuf You're right it crashes on me too makapav I believe, brand accounts/pages were deprecated a long time ago. vwnut13 Creating a new Brand Account is still available on both Google+ and Youtube. Actually, it's not only available, but there is a direct link to create a Brand Account on the Google+ homepage. Suicide_Note Now we just need to be able to manually tag people in a photo. Capt4chris And for search to include shared albums. :-) chris mellor Im on 2.12 and still dont have this feature. johnforamerica Bring back the damn cloud backup icon on individual thumbnails! Since that went away, no way to tell which photos are backed up! (Other than opening each individual photo) Suicide_Note Agreed. It would be nice to have that back. Dennis Ulijn It'll tell you everything's backed up or how many items still need to backed up. I understand not every solution is perfect for everyone, but what would the clutter of a cloud symbol in each photo solve? johnforamerica It would solve exactly what I described. I selectively back up, I don't want everything backed up. With a library of thousands of pictures, you tell me how to figure out which have not yet been backed up... As it functions now, I have NO IDEA what is backed up or not unless I use one of two crappy options: 1) Click on each pic individually to view the cloud icon showing backup status 2) Try to cross reference my device photos with the web version to see "what's missing" It seems pretty clear to me that Google wants to push its users to use the auto backup function, and this is just another step in trying to compel that usage. Dennis Ulijn Okay, fair enough. Thomas Stockx Is this a US only feature? I've been using Google Photo's for ages on my Nexus 6, 6P, and Pixel, but Google is unable to give me search results for any name. Dennis Ulijn Yes. Use a VPN to enable it once, and then it keeps working. You'd have to put in the names yourself though, but after that it keeps adding photos of that person. Florian Reisinger Where to enable it? Dennis Ulijn I think it's the option called 'face grouping'. I use tunnelbear to create a vpn to america. Ailín Ó’S Apparently it's against EU law or something to do that so it's not in Europe. But once you enable it once it works always. rumanuu76 Yep I visited USA, it started working and now always works 😎 towo Still not available in Germany. *sigh* Fruity101079 With a VPN (or chrome extension), fake your location and access google photos , you will be able to enable it. towo Doesn't seem to populate any face matches, though, or does it just take a long time? Jack Smith I need to be able to tag my pets Fruity101079 We still can't change the location of the picture (don't know why, some of them are completely wrong...) thespacecowboy This has been a feature for a long time. Go to Assistant, then Search, then it'll bring a long horizontal list of photos. Click on those, and it will bring all the people it 'knows'. Click on someone it doesn't know and name them, and it'll tag those people in all your photos so you can search them. therealbiglou Yes, we are all aware. This isn't the point of this article. Rita El Khoury That's not what this is. Re-read the post please. thespacecowboy But Rita. Reading is hard! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/1849b9b0acd9cc0f34a50f0fb75f93662013c9cd00535267a4111a9bffb739c5.jpg 4Ui812 Reading is easy , comprehension is hard. Cecil Hardwood This only works for faces/people Google sees. I have lots of photos that for whatever reason Google has not identified any people in them or maybe 1 out of 3. It would be nice to be able to go back and add the ones Google missed. 4Ui812 You're a good looking lady Rita. It's a nice picture , you should use this one as your avatar. Peter Garlinski I'm assuming you're going to get at least a couple good bottles of beer for giving your friend publicity. Rita El Khoury Given how many times I've screenshotted stuff with him in it, I have to ask for at least one Pixel XL :p Vinayak Prabhu This is completely off topic. I noticed that you are using a S7 Edge.. How has it hold up after a year? Is there noticeably lag every now and then? m33d Rita's eyebrows be lookin' "on fleek!" Rita El Khoury Had to Google that. Thanks :) Kevin Chapple But, regrettably STILL not available in the UK.. ANY idea when this will be 'fixed' for the UK? jwildman16 Some others here stated that you can enable a VPN to a U.S. location, start adding names to faces, and then it will continue to do so after the VPN is disconnected. Matthew Merrick Doesn't matter. My Google Photos facial recognition wipes itself every 2 weeks for some godforsaken reason, rendering the service's most useful ability irrelevant, considering it rebuilds at not even one photo per day. Divya Pant Valuable information on Google Photos. Looking forward to seeing your notes posted. The information you have posted is very useful. Keep going on, good stuff.

COMMENT More than 20 per cent of desktop queries and around 50 per cent of mobile queries are local in nature Ben Lobel Local SEO (search engine optimisation) is one of the effective ways of reaching customers who are looking to buy a service/product in the area you trade. Both Google and Bing have highlighted the importance of local SEO for businesses: over 20 per cent of desktop queries and around 50 per cent of mobile queries are local in nature. If optimisation is done well, you could be one of the first businesses customers see when they conduct their online search, meaning you could secure customers who may have never heard of your business before. Business insurance specialists, Premier BusinessCare, have many years’ experience working with UK businesses and actively use digital channels to target market. So they have shared some great local SEO tips that independent businesses could benefit from in order to out-perform their local rivals in web searches. Take a look at what you need to do to get started. Business name If you are just starting your business, you may want to consider how the name can impact how easily new customers find you in searches. By having the type of business and the area you trade included within both the business name and the website’s domain name, (eg a bakery in Margate might be called The Margate Bakery, and website domain name themargatebakery.co.uk) you are making it extremely clear to search engines that your business is in this area. This means when someone makes a local search (such as ‘Margate bakery’, or they search ‘bakery near me’ when they are in the area), your business has a good chance of showing highly in the search results. If your business trades from multiple locations, having the area in your domain name is not a good idea. You should instead create a non-area specific domain (ie carlsbooks.co.uk), and then individual location pages on your site (eg carlsbooks.co.uk/croydon). Then in Google My Business (explained below), create locations which match these pages. If your business’s name doesn’t explain its function, categories in Google My Business should help search engines define what you are selling. Google My Business Google My Business (GMB) is an important tool that many small businesses use for local SEO. Without GMB, you have no control over how your business appears in a local search or on Google Maps. Your business may still appear in the search results, but you may find that it is not presented as you would like, and may not rank as well as it could in local searches, giving customers greater opportunity to choose one of your competitors. For your GMB account, you need to add information which is going to show in the search results, i.e. business name, phone number, address, website URL, opening times, images, etc. If you are unsure about what you need to add, take a look at an existing Google Maps listing. Categorisation in GMB To make sure search results are as relevant as possible, search engines rely heavily on category data. Business owners can add categories themselves through GMB. You may add multiple categories if your business provides more than one service or product. For example, if your hairdressing business also trades as a nail salon, you would need to add “nail salon” to your GMB categories, as well as “hairdressers”. For the best chance of ranking well for searches related to your business, try not to overload your GMB account with irrelevant categories, as this can draw attention away from your key categories. Managing reviews via GMB Online reviews of your business can be very powerful – both in the positive and negative sense. If you were trying to choose between two local businesses, would you choose the one with 2 negative reviews, or the one with 3 positive reviews and 2 negative? Reviews can often be the deciding factor on a decidedly thin line. By using Google My Business, you have the ability to respond to both negative and positive reviews. If you receive a positive review, you can thank the customer for their feedback, which may encourage repeat custom. Likewise, if you receive a negative review complaining of a faulty item, a speedy response which acknowledges the issue, with an action to rectify the problem will look good for potential customers who are browsing similar businesses. In fact, any response is better than no response when it comes to online reviews: by picking up on customer feedback, you are telling the potential customer that you are open for business and are proactive in keeping customers happy. A great way to obtain positive reviews for your business is to send an email request to repeat customers, asking if they’d like to leave a review for you. If you deal with customers on your premises, such as in a shop or car garage, then simply ask your repeat customers in person. Most people who are buying from you on a frequent basis should be happy to help you out. Business listings and citations Getting your business name, address and phone number listed (known as a citation) on reputable sites can shore up search engines’ confidence in the accuracy of your business details, which could mean better rankings in local search results. If all of these details are consistent with those on your GMB account, you will stand an even greater chance of beating competitors for searches relevant to your business. Some leading websites to create free listings on are Facebook, Hotfrog, Yelp and Foursquare, which are all deemed extremely trustworthy by search engines. Getting a lot of citations from reputable sites is the ideal scenario and, if you have listed your business on the above four listing sites, you will already have a head start. The important thing is that the details are consistent across all listings. You can monitor citations with a simple site search, i.e. ‘site:webname.co.uk’ for mentions of your domain, or do a generic search using double quotation marks for ‘[your company’s name]’ to check any mentions of your business details across the web. If you spot any incorrect business details, you should either change the listing yourself, or get in touch with the site owner and request for it to be changed. Local content on your website Another important part of local SEO is to have content about the area on your website. The usual place for this is on a ‘Contact Us’ page. Along with your address, telephone number, email address and opening times, you should add other useful information, such as travel directions from nearby places. If you wish to show your location in a way most people are familiar with, you can add a Google Map of your location to the page, (such as on the Waterstone’s website). As well as being useful for potential customers, this provides even more evidence to search engines that your business operates in that locality. If you implement all of the above, in time you will have a great chance of outperforming your rivals in local search engine results and winning over potential new customers.

COMMENT Google Analytics offers powerful data for your business Ben Lobel Google Analytics (GA) is an incredibly powerful tool, but many features are underused. A lot of people just use GA to see how much traffic they’re getting on a daily or weekly basis, but if you really want to understand how users use your site, and how to improve its performance, GA is packed with valuable data. Here are just a few of the insights that Google can offer. Using behaviour flow The ‘Behaviour Flow’ tab ( under the ‘Behaviour’ tab) is a really powerful part of GA. It allows you to see the path visitors normally take from when they visit your site to when they exit. With this part of GA you can diagnose potential problems with the site: are a lot of people leaving the site on the same page? How could you change the copy or design to prevent this? How many people are landing on the pages you actively want them to land on and which pages acts as a trigger page (if any) when it comes to conversions? Checking site speed Site speed is really important, for lots of reasons. The first one is the most obvious, you want your site to load as quickly as possible, because a slower site means higher page abandonment by users. Also site speed is a direct ranking signal. So, if your site is a bit slow then your site’s search engine rankings might suffer. While it’s not a huge ranking factor, it shouldn’t be ignored and GA can help with just that. From the ‘Behaviour’ tab, navigate to ‘Site Speed’ and from here you can check average page load times, check out suggestions to improve speed and find out how quickly your site loads in different browsers. Ideally you should be aiming for page load times of less than two seconds. Finding out what people are searching on your site So you’ve got a search box in the upper corner of your site, a box that pretty much every other site on the web has. It works fine and people, you assume, use it, but how many? And what are they searching for? Well, GA can answer both those questions for you and more. You will have to set it up first, but that’s fairly painless, you can find more details on that here. Once set up you can get all sorts of wonderful information from site search. These include finding out how many sessions used the search box, what terms they searched for and how many average page views were generated through searches. Traffic breakdown The biggest and simplest way of using GA is finding out just where your traffic is coming from. Are you getting more traffic from organic search results or from paid? How effective are your email campaigns at directing traffic to your site? And what about social? Are your social campaigns proving effective at driving traffic? Within each of these categories you can then break down how your visitors are using your site. You can see bounce rates, average session times, page sessions, as well as goal conversions. Just navigate to the ‘Acquisition’ tab, then to ‘All Traffic’ and then ‘Channels’. Device segmentation Mobile web searches have been rising steadily over recent years, in fact, as of May 2015 Google reported that mobile searches have surpassed desktop searches. But, when it comes to your site, how high? How much should you be focusing on mobile and tablet searches compared with desktop users? To determine that you would need to know how many visits to your site are from mobile and tablet. Well, GA can tell you exactly that. Your website should already be optimised for mobile (if not, why not?) but if most of your users are searching for your site on a smaller screen you should definitely consider taking a second look at the design of your site. This is just a brief overview of the main benefits of one of the most powerful tools on offer from Google. And what’s more, it’s completely free.

The app, released after months of expanded testing and refinement, will be released in other emerging markets later. The application shows up as a rocket symbol on your phone and on the app store. Youtube Go App Icon.More The app provides fresh and relevant video recommendations tailored to one’s preferences. It is designed to be offline first and to improve the experience of watching videos on a slower network. It gives you more control over data usage, by providing choice and transparency into the amount of data spent on streaming or saving videos, and it's social, allowing you to share videos quickly and easily with friends nearby. YouTube Go home screen features trending and popular videos in an area, so that a user can find and discover videos that his/her community cares about. Introducing the new YouTube Go app in beta - ab mazze udao, data nahi → https://t.co/iawp8c3aET pic.twitter.com/MAinh0o7Bv— YouTube India (@YouTubeIndia) April 5, 2017 On YouTube Go, a user can see a preview of the video when one taps on a thumbnail, giving a better sense of what the video is about. A user can also choose to save a video for offline viewing later. With a tagline of "Mazze Udao, Data Nahi", YouTube Go now allows a user to preview and choose the size of the video. There are no high definition videos available and all content can only be viewed in standard definition. With YouTube Go, users can share videos with friends and family nearby without using any data.

The certification is the latest in the series of projects Google has undertaken to improve browsing experience on smartphones, with the primary focus being speed and improved browsing experience. For Web Developers and Tech Professionals The people targeted in the program include “web developer, webmaster, or technical professional working with agencies or in-house to create mobile sites.” Passing the test gives you a Mobile Sites certification on your Google developer page, which acts as a proof of your “ability to build and optimize high-quality sites.” Focus on User Experience However, that’s not the only benefit as clearing the test will also potentially reward developers with higher traffic and reputation. As Google points out, most users leave a site within 3 seconds if the page takes longer to load, even though the average load time is 22 seconds. Good user experience is key here and passing the test ensures that you add it to your expertise. The certification program consists of an exam that tests your ability to use newly-added features and technologies, alongside mainstream ones. Test Details To start you need to sign up for the Google Partners Program. Afterwards you will be able to access Google Analytics, Google Adwords and the Mobile Sites Certification. Candidates need to get through 65 questions in 90 minutes, while failure means a waiting time of 7 days before the next attempt. Such tests are not uncommon for Google, as they are already in place for attaining certifications in AdWords and Analytics. Study Guide for The Test Google has made a study guide available for these exams for your ease which can be accessed here. Some of the sections in the study guide include basics of mobile sites, user expectations, importance of UX, discover-ability, etc. It also introduces you to tools required to improving the experience, and finally an introduction with advanced web technologies. While the accreditation may give you some bragging rights as a developer, the greater benefits from the test will be derived from the improvements in user-experience.       Source Tags: Google | mobile site certificate Web Desk Website Previous ArticleThe World’s Most Influential Civil Engineer Was A Muslim Next Article Peshawar’s Bus Rapid Transit Will Have No Govt Subsidy Related Stories Raheel Sharif’s appointment to Saudi-led military alliance a state decision, says DG ISPR Army calls for improved coordination in wake of Lahore attack Misbah, Younis, Kohli get Wisden honours Leave A Reply Cancel Reply Your Name (required) Your Email (required) Your Website (optional) Connect with Us 2985followers 44834likes 43followers You Might Also Like Google and Levi’s will launch their first smart jacket this fall for $350 (Project Jacquard) It’s been nearly two years since Google revealed it was working on technology to create smart ...read more Google app update now covers your failed searches due to patchy Internet The latest update of Google’s Android app – rolled out on January 16, 2017 – developers have ...read more 10 Secret Things You Didn’t Know You Could Do With Google Google opens the door to wonders but if I say Google homepage is no less ...read more Recent Posts 0 April 6, 2017 Raheel Sharif’s appointment to Saudi-led military alliance a state decision, says DG ISPR 0 April 6, 2017 Army calls for improved coordination in wake of Lahore attack 0 April 6, 2017 Misbah, Younis, Kohli get Wisden honours Popular Post August 18, 2013 Pakistan Cruise Missiles Vs India Ballistic Missile Defense July 15, 2014 Ajit Doval: The Indian who wants to ‘destroy’ Pakistan?

Ron Amadeo - Apr 5, 2017 2:50 pm UTC reader comments 116 Share this story The LG G6. The back is glass with a brushed metal look underneath. Ron Amadeo The back is LG's usual dual-camera and rear fingerprint reader design. Check out that slim bezel and that rounded screen. Ron Amadeo Well, not quite perfectly round. The screen corners are pretty awkward. Despite the tiny bezel, the top of the phone contains all the usual components. Ron Amadeo The SIM and MicroSD slot. Ron Amadeo The top has a headphone jack. Ron Amadeo The side has the volume keys. Ron Amadeo That single offset antenna line is a little weird. Other than that there's the USB-C port and speaker. Ron Amadeo SPECS AT A GLANCE: LG G6 SCREEN 2880×1440 5.7" (564ppi) IPS LCD OS Android 7.0 CPU Quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 (two 2.35GHz Kryo cores and two 1.6 GHz Kryo cores) RAM 4GB GPU Adreno 530 STORAGE 32GB NETWORKING 802.11b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.2, GPS, NFC PORTS USB 3.1 Type-C, 3.5mm headphone jack CAMERA Dual 13MP rear cameras, 5MP front camera SIZE 148.9 x 71.9 x 7.9 mm  (5.86 x 2.83 x 0.31 in) WEIGHT 163g (5.75oz) BATTERY 3300 mAh STARTING PRICE $650-$700 OTHER PERKS Quick charging, fingerprint sensor, wireless charging, MicroSD slot Remember LG's last flagship phone? Most people probably don't, since the G5 was more or less a disaster. The G5 was a modular phone with modules that weren't really compelling; the "metal" body had a thick plastic coating on the outside; and the device had tons of build quality issues, like seams that didn't line up, an uneven display backlight, and sharp edges. Even LG has admitted the G5 was a disappointment—the company lost nearly $400 million in Q3 2016, which it blamed on "weak sales of [the] G5." In response, the LG G6 is all new and much improved. The modular system has been scrapped in exchange for a solid phone with no removable parts. That means the battery isn't removable anymore, but you do get IP68 dust and water resistance in exchange. There are no build quality issues to be had here, and the front has a slick design with slim bezels. LG has done an outstanding job fixing the things people didn't like about the G5, but is a "personal best" from LG good enough in the cutthroat smartphone market? The LG G6 seems to be launching in the US at the worst possible time. The phone uses Qualcomm's 2016 SoC—the Qualcomm Snapdragon 821—in 2017, making it already seem dated. The G6 is also launching right as Samsung's hype machine for the Galaxy S8 is revving up. G6 will hit store shelves one week after the Galaxy S8 launch event, which is sure to steal some customers away. Is there any reason to pick up a G6 when the Galaxy S8 is looking like one of the best Samsung smartphones in years? Design Enlarge / The LG G6 versus the Google Pixel XL. The Pixel's bezels sure look awful next to this slim-line wonder. Ron Amadeo After the Xiaomi Mi Mix, the LG G6 is the latest in a line of slim-bezel smartphone designs. The top and bottom bezels have been shrunk from their usual size, leaving much more room for the 5.7-inch display. Rather than just go with a bigger 16:9 display, which would make the phone wider, LG is using a taller display—the aspect ratio is 18:9 or 2:1, with a resolution of 2880x1440. As a result, we've got a 5.7-inch display that doesn't feel like the 5.7-inch devices that have come before it. Holding the G6 feels much more like holding a compact phone rather than the usual 5.7-inch behemoths like the Galaxy Note line. Width is what makes a phone feel "big." If we keep using Samsung as an example, the 71.9mm width of the LG G6 is closer to the 69.6mm-wide Galaxy S7 (with a 5.2-inch display) than the 76.1mm width of the Galaxy Note 5. I'm a fan of the taller display. You get to see more list items, which means more e-mails, more messages, and more webpages, all without increasing the width of the phone and making it harder to hold. The tiny bezels make the phone look very modern, and the G6 blows away traditional smartphone designs like the Google Pixel or iPhone 7. The display has rounded corners, a trivial design choice that seems like it's just aimed at making the phone look different. If you're a detail-oriented person, though, you'll quickly notice LG's rounded-over corners aren't executed very well. The transition from the straight edge to the curve isn't smooth, leaving pointy shoulders at the beginning and end of the curve. It's not particularly good looking, which is tough for a feature designed to do nothing other than look good. Glass and fingerprints The back of the LG G6 is glass, which is a disappointment. The expectation at this price point ($700+) is metal, which you can get from Apple, Huawei, Google (sort of), or from even cheaper manufacturers like OnePlus. A metal body is harder for the manufacturer to implement—all sorts of considerations need to be made for getting radio signals in and out of the metal box. A metal back is better for the consumer, though, and results in a more premium, durable device. With the glass back, one drop and something on the LG G6 will probably crack. LG equipped the G6 with a rear fingerprint reader, which is definitely the fastest option for unlocking a phone by pulling it out of your pocket. A rear fingerprint reader does have some weaknesses, though, mainly when the phone is sitting on a table—you can't unlock the device with your finger unless you pick up the phone. Luckily, LG chose to keep Google Smart Lock around, a feature that allows you to set a ton of conditions about when the phone will automatically unlock. You can have the phone stay unlocked when it is connected to a "trusted" Bluetooth device you own. You can also set geofencing zones when the phone will stay unlocked. This is useful for home or some workplaces—the place where your phone will most likely be on a table. The rear fingerprint reader is kind of a pain to use if you have to use it every time, but Smart Lock does a great job of mitigating the awkwardness of a rear fingerprint reader. You get the best of both worlds—a fingerprint reader that is speedy to use out-of-pocket, and a phone that easily handles home and work desktop scenarios. LG went with a much more conservative design than what Xiaomi was able to come up with. Despite the slim bezels, all the usual components are in their normal place. The earpiece, camera, and sensors all live above the display, while the bottom is reserved for the LG logo. The sides have a chamfered metal band interrupted by the occasional antenna line. Overall, the G6 feels great, and while I'd rather not have a glass back, the exterior design is definitely the high point of this phone. LG's Android skin: Out of date, but mostly harmless The home screen has no app drawer! After that, there's recent apps and the Google Assistant. Notifications are intact on the lock screen and notification panel. The settings are rearranged enough to make online tutorials impossible to follow, but we can deal. LG Smart World in action. Smart World has a lot of loading screens. Themes! Most of them are just "turn everything the same color." The LG G6 is equipped with Android 7.0, an old version of Android. You aren't missing much of what you could get in Android 7.1.2, but it's a bad sign for the future. LG's software goes for a very iOS look and feel on the home screen, with rectangular icons and no app drawer. The lack of an app drawer means every app needs to take up a spot on the home screen, which leads to a messy home screen. The home screen is one of the most easily replaceable parts of Android, so a quick install of Nova Launcher or the Google Now Launcher easily gets you a more stock look. Everything else is "change for change's sake," painting over all of Android just to make the G6 look slightly different, without the addition of too many new features. The quick settings panel is white now, but more or less works the way normal Android does and is customizable. The settings are renamed and moved around a bit, which makes following most online documentation impossible, but everything is still there somewhere. The Recent Apps has mostly been left alone, aside from a few harmless (though maybe cluttered) buttons in each app's title bar. The lock screen is intact, too. LG's software is mostly harmless and mostly replaceable by a dedicated user. Nothing critical seems broken. Before launch, a big deal was made of the Google Assistant being pre-loaded on the LG G6, but during the eternity between the G6's announcement and its actual launch, Google has released the Assistant for all phones running Android 6.0 and up. Still, seeing the Assistant here is appreciated, and the "OK Google" hotword is supported in always-on mode, meaning it will work even when the screen is off, just like a Pixel. Smart World is neither smart nor a world As far as additions go, LG has an all-encompassing app store called "LG Smart World." It is one of the most poorly coded apps I have ever used. It's outrageously slow and doesn't even seem like it's aimed at the G6. The store's low resolution imagery and incorrect aspect ratios stretch app and theme previews horizontally. The app scrolls terribly and is full of multi-second loading spinners. Since LG Smart World is hosted in a server in South Korea, any network activity or download takes forever. Even pressing the search button brings up a loading spinner, and thanks to a poorly implemented find-as-you-type system, the display is usually five to six letters behind your actual typing. You'll type your query, lift up your fingers, and watch the query slowly type onto the screen. You will mostly be using this disaster of an app store for the theming function. Themes can recolor the app icons, notification panel, settings screen, and some of the built-in apps. The G6 comes with five pre-loaded themes, and you can download more from LG Smart World if you can bear to use it. Here you'll find about 80 themes, all made by about two different companies. You can also use the store for the special G6-specific 18:9, HDR10 movies. There are a whopping four videos, covering the usual "TV display demo" subject matter—nature films! Other than that, the G6 has the usual load of crapware. Stuff from LG, stuff from your carrier, an antivirus app, Facebook, and a smart cleaning app. A lot of it is removable, which is nice. Updates Besides how the software is now, updating the phone over its lifetime will also be LG's responsibility. The best indicator of this is to see how LG has treated its customers in the past on other flagship devices. Android 7.0 rollouts first started hitting last year's LG G5 in November, two-and-a-half months after the first availability of Google's new OS. That rollout was only to a select group of unlocked G5s in Korea, though. In the US, LG actually just finished the Nougat rollout in February, taking almost six months to update everything. Once the phone is a year old, LG support gets iffy. LG originally said it would not update its 2015 flagships, the LG G4 and LG V10, to Nougat. It you count from the initial release of Nougat, that would have given the G4 less than 15 months of major update support, and the LG V10 would have had less than nine months of update support. After a public outcry, LG reversed course. The company now says (in Korea) it will deliver Android 7.0 Nougat to "the V10 in the second half of this year and for the G4 in the third quarter." That would be at least 10 months after Nougat's launch, but keep in mind this is the release date for Korea, which usually gets the updates first. In the US, the timing of the updates is probably left to your local carrier. Even the suggestion of less than a year of support is awful, considering Google supports phones for two years with major updates, and Apple typically supports devices for a whopping five years. The LG G6 isn't even launching with the latest version of Android. While Android 7.1 is out, and Google is already launching alphas of Android O, the LG G6 is shipping with Android 7.0. This seems in line for the usual LG flagship software experience: expect to perpetually be one to two versions behind the latest release of Android. LG is at least providing monthly security updates. The LG G6 shipped to me with the "March 2017" update and even updated to April 2017 while I was reviewing it. The company even has a security bulletin page up at lgsecurity.lge.com. Whether these updates actually get delivered to you depends on your carrier, as LG's page warns that "Depending on regions and carriers, updates may be released monthly, quarterly, or irregularly."

Unfortunately, ChromeOS isn't a panacea, and serious security concerns about the platform remain. Read More , nothing is. But you can easily make the argument that Chromebooks are the most secure laptops on the market. However, just because they’re secure at a hardware level doesn’t mean you can’t improve their security at a user level. Here are four ways to make your Chromebook even more secure Securing Your Chromebook With Two Easy Tweaks Securing Your Chromebook With Two Easy Tweaks One of the most touted benefits of a Chromebook is its security. But are there any steps that owners can take that will improve and enhance the current level of protection? Read More . 1. Deploy Guest Mode Guest Mode’s primary purpose is to allow other people to use your machine without using your Google Account. As such, it keeps your data on Google’s suite of apps safe from prying eyes. But Google itself likes to pry. Anything you do on your Chromebook — whether it’s saving a song to Google Drive, visiting a particular website, or installing an app from the Web Store — is logged against your Google Account. Google then uses the mountain of information to show you (supposedly) relevant ads. If you’re planning to do things you don’t want Google to log against your account, the best approach is to use the Guest Mode. Unlike Incognito Mode Guest Mode vs. Incognito Mode in Chrome: What's the Difference? Guest Mode vs. Incognito Mode in Chrome: What's the Difference? Chrome offers Incognito mode and Guest mode for private browsing. While they're similar, some key differences separate them. Here's when to use which one. Read More , which still sits within your user profile on your machine, Guest Mode is in no way attached to your account. Guest Mode still lets you download files and browse the entire web. The only restriction is you cannot install new apps. To use Guest Mode, press Ctrl + Shift + Q if you’re already logged in, or select Browse as Guest from the shelf on the main login screen. If Guest Mode is not enabled on your Chromebook, head to Settings > People > Manage Other Users > Enable Guest Browsing. 2. Change the Default Search Engine If using the Guest Mode is either too extreme or too inconvenient, you can at least replace the default search engine. There are several search engines that don’t track you 7 Google Search Alternatives and Their Trademark Features 7 Google Search Alternatives and Their Trademark Features Are you a die-hard Google user? Give these alternative search engines a try. From privacy to helping out charitable causes, these search engines could give you some reasons to change the way you browse. Read More , store your IP address, or profile their users. Two of the most popular are DuckDuckGo and Startpage. DuckDuckGo draws its results from more than 50 “high-quality” sources, while Startpage removes all your identifying information then submits the search term to Google’s search engine. If you value the depth and breadth of Google’s results, the latter is probably the best option. To change your Chromebook’s default search engine, navigate to the homepage of the engine you want to use and perform a search for any word or phrase. Doing so will make the search engine a selectable option in the browser’s list of providers. Next, right-click in the address bar and choose Edit Search Engines. Scroll down and search through the list of domains under Other Search Engines until you find your provider. Finally, click Make Default. 3. Change the DNS Service Chromebooks do allow you to hard-configure the DNS service, but the option is buried away and not easy to find. Changing your DNS has significant benefits: it can improve your connection speed, increase uptime, and sometimes even let you access geo-blocked content. Security-wise, the benefits can be split into three categories: Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) — DNSSEC prevents apps and DNS resolvers from falling victim to fake or compromised DNS data. Most ISP DNS services do not offer this feature. Phishing Protection — Obviously, most browsers now have built-in phishing protection, but it adds an extra layer of safety. Parental Controls — Parental controls are particularly useful if you have young children who regularly use your Chromebook. The laptops don’t have any native parental controls. Not all public DNS services have all the benefits. For example, Google DNS and OpenDNS both support DNSSEC, but only OpenDNS supports parental controls and anti-phishing. Do your research before selecting one. To change the DNS service on your Chromebook, go to Settings > internet Connection, click the name of your Wi-Fi network, then click on your name again in the drop-down menu. On the new window, click the Network tab. At the bottom of the window, you can choose either Automatic Name Servers (your ISP’s), Google Name Servers, or Custom Name Servers. You need to repeat this process for every Wi-Fi network you use. 4.

HTTPS Everywhere HTTPS Everywhere is a joint development between Tor Project and the Electronic Frontier Foundation. The premise is simple: the extension automatically converts insecure HTTP domains to secure HTTPS domains. The switch will help protect you against surveillance and domain hijacking. Privacy Badger Privacy Badger is another app from the Electronic Frontier Foundation. It’s an anti-tracking extension that prevents spying ads and invisible trackers from loading on a page. You can even customize which permissions are allowed on a granular case-by-case basis for each site.

In addition to the VPN feature, it also encrypts all your browsing using SSL and hides your IP address from sites. The app is ad-supported. How Do You Make Your Chromebook Secure? When combined with a Chromebook’s hardware-level security, following my four tips and installing the three extensions will turn your laptop into a fortress. It would arguably become the safest and most secure way of accessing the world-wide web. However, my list isn’t exhaustive. There are always more steps you can take to make yourself more secure.

After quick updates like the LG G5 Android Nougat release, things have slowed down. Many are excitedly awaiting it to arrive, and here we’ll be going over everything owners need to know. From release schedules, confirmations and more. Including the LG G4 Nougat release. Way back in August last year Google rolled out Android 7.0 Nougat. Since then we’ve seen multiple quick maintenance updates, including 7.1.2 for the Pixel. Those with LG smartphone though, aren’t getting updates as quick. Read: Android 7.1 Nougat vs Android 6.0: What’s New Thanks to an LG Nougat preview program updates have been faster this time around. However, millions of those with an LG G4 or V10 are still waiting. Additionally, some LG G5 owners are still on Marshmallow, and are wondering when they’ll get the latest and greatest software. That and more is detailed below for all LG smartphone owners. Popular smartphones from all major manufacturers will see updates to Android 7.0 in the near future, if not already. Reports have surfaced from Samsung, LG, HTC, Sony and many others. Manufacturers are pushing out Android 7.0 though, and not the latest 7.1.1 release by Google. That will come later this year. Owners with the LG G4, LG G5, LG V10, budget devices and potentially even the older LG G3 will get Android 7.0 Nougat. Some already have. And while LG has been relatively quiet, we’re starting to see more movement. In fact, some benchmark results were spotted with the LG G3 running Nougat. A device that’s nearly two years old. That’s a good sign for owners, but don’t expect it anytime soon. If you have a G4 or V10 though, we have some relatively good news to share. The LG G4 Nougat Update is coming soon With that said, when will your LG device get Android Nougat? We’re not entirely sure, but we have some details worth sharing. Here’s the latest news on LG Android 7.0 Nougat updates, what’s new and more. LG Android 7.0 Nougat Updates The first smartphone to ship with Android 7.0 Nougat was the LG V20. As a result many expected LG to be one of the first for software updates too. On November 8th LG confirmed the LG G5 Android 7.0 update had begun. However, it didn’t arrive for those in the United States until far later, and most didn’t get it until February. A few are even waiting as we’re now in March. On November 8th the LG G5 Android 7.0 update began in Korea. LG confirmed it would soon arrive in the United States, Asia, then continue to other popular markets around the globe. The first update in the United States arrived on November 21st. Beginning with the Sprint LG G5. Several users on Reddit confirmed the news, then eventually Sprint made it official. The T-Mobile LG G5 Android 7.0 Nougat update quickly followed, and then the Verizon LG G5 update kicked off in December. Below is a screenshot confirming the software, November 1st security patch, and the large 1.3GB file. Here’s a screenshot for proof. The T-Mobile LG G5 Android 7.0 update is now available So what about AT&T? They’ve been fast with updates in the past, but that wasn’t the case this time around with the LG G5. AT&T is the last major carrier to send out G5 Nougat updates, which began February 20th. Multiple reports online have confirmed its arrival. Head into Settings > About Phone > and check for updates. Remember, AT&T only allows users to check once per day. Otherwise you’ll need to change the phone date forward and try again. It can take up to two weeks to hit your device, so by now most should have it. Next, LG will continue their efforts on the LG V10 and LG G4. When though, is a complete mystery. Originally we heard February and March, but that obviously didn’t happen. However, we do have new information. Reports from Korea say to expect the LG G4 Android 7.1 Nougat update in Q3, which seems way too late. Same goes for the LG V10, which could see it this summer. These are only rumors though, and we’re expecting LG to get these out within the next 1-2 months at the latest. When we know more we’ll share all the details.  The V20 needs a bug-fixing update too, as it has its fair share of problems with Nougat. Surprisingly, select LG G3 phones have been spotted with Nougat. And while it’s possible it may receive an update, the phone is nearly two years old. Meaning it may only get security and maintenance updates, not the new software. We’ll have to wait and see. What’s New in Android 7.0 Nougat At the top of the page LG owners can find an in-depth breakdown of Android 7.0 Nougat, how it compares to older software and everything that’s new. Of course LG has a lot of changes to the look and feel of our software, but it is a great place to start for owners. As a quick recap, the LG Android 7.0 update will bring improvements across the board. From performance, battery life enhancements, improved split-screen multitasking and other changes. Google has over 50+ changes in Android N. Like faster app installs, which are also smaller, a new JIT compiler, improved graphics and performance with the Vulkan API, and even streamlined notifications with new quick reply controls. Not to mention customizable quick setting tiles and other things. Expect all of that and much more from LG Nougat updates. A big addition to Android announced back at Google IO was “Instant Apps” which enables our devices to install small bits of an app (from a search result or web link) and allow one-time instant app usage. Giving smartphone users an app-like experience without downloading anything or leaving the web. Android just adds what it needs for that moment, and removes it once we’re done with the app. Here is more information on Instant Apps, which is now available for select Nougat devices. Most of this will come with LG’s software skin on top, and closely resemble the sleeker UI we’ve seen on the LG V20. Samsung has TouchWiz, HTC uses Sense UI, etc. Don’t expect everything from Nexus or Pixel devices, but most of Android 7.0 Nougat will soon enhance your LG device. Additionally, the Google Assistant is rolling out to any and all smartphones on Android 6.0 Marshmallow or 7.0 Nougat. It should be on most phones by now, or soon. Final Thoughts As of today the LG V20 and LG G5 are the only LG devices on Android Nougat. Others will follow in the near future. Now that the final US carrier is sending out Nougat to the LG G5, we should start to hear more about the V10 and G4 from 2016. We know they are next, it’s just a matter of when. Hopefully the Q3 launch rumor is wrong. It’s worth nothing that most of LG’s updates have arrived in February or March the year after Google releases an update. Like The LG G3 Android 5.0 update arrived March a few years back. Considering the G5 was in December the company is a few months ahead of schedule. If that’s anything to go by we could see LG G4 Nougat updates in April. Stay tuned for more details, and we’ll update the moment we know more. 9 Responses 11/09/2016 Danny Jacobovitz Reply I’d be happy if my 2 devices running Marshmallow would get update 6.0.1! There are bluetooth bugs in 6.0.0 that make using the phone with things like Tile useless… 02/21/2017 Sarmad Reply Is LG x screen going to get Android 7? 02/25/2017 RAGG Reply Still waiting for LG G4 update. No release date has been published. I the meanwhile, a lot of phones are having the update. This may become a marketing promo for future updates. A promise to keep the phone updates as soon as possible. If not, customers may consider other phone options at purshase time. LG wakeup. 02/26/2017 tom Reply we w8 x screen update to 7, LG dont sleep 03/02/2017 Vikas Reply Lg k420ds will get nougat update or not 03/28/2017 Anup Das Reply I m frm india. I also have a lg product its lg g3. Can i going to be a update for my g3 without out root. 04/01/2017 Ayush Rastogi Reply I am waiting to get a update for my LG V10. 04/02/2017 Isaac Giannotti Reply What about the LG K10? Will Android 7.0 be available for this too? 04/05/2017 Konar Kunte Reply Android 7.0 was officially released on August 22, 2016 . Today, after almost 1 Year 2.8% of all mobile, running the almost 1 year old Operating system. LG update policy sucks! As spoken, after around 1 year after the Release, LG wasn’t able to upgrade my 1 Year old V10 to the next Version . Without looking into the amount of kernel bugs, security overall, this was my LAST LG Android Mobile. https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/180113/umfrage/anteil-der-verschiedenen-android-versionen-auf-geraeten-mit-android-os/ Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

Google Photos details info page shows you the people inside a photo Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/04/05 5:54am PDTApr 5, 2017 35 Plus 1 on G+ 33 Share on Facebook 55 Share on Twitter Total Shares123 Applications Google News Google Photos is really good at recognizing people in a photo and grouping their pics together. It's one feature I've come to rely on to find all the photos I have of specific friends or family members and even photos of "person X and person Y and person Z" together. But there were still a couple of small things missing from Photos' facial recognition like the option to manually tag a person in a pic or the ability to see who Google had recognized in a photo from the photo itself, not their dedicated page. But the latter is now implemented. Actually, it was implemented at some point in the last few versions: I can confirm that it wasn't there in 2.10.0.148909749 but it is live in 2.12.0.151124741, so it was added to Photos sometime between March 13 and 30. Small details aside, this is a simple but nice change. When you tap in the Info icon on any photo while you're browsing your library, you will see a new People section below Description and above Details. In it are thumbnails of all the people Google has recognized in your pics. You can tap the thumbnail to immediately go to that person's dedicated Photos page with all the albums and pictures they're in. Zaher is a very dear friend with an undying love for Android. I'll make him pay for the free publicity. This is a great way to see who Google has tagged in your photos and to jump to individual people's photos without searching for them first. It still doesn't seem to be possible to manually tag someone in your Photos but I'd imagine the function is coming at some point. Google Photos 2.12.0.151124741 has been live on the Play Store for a few days but it's also on APK Mirror if you prefer to grab it there.

Trying to switch to one of these accounts in Google Photos causes the app to crash, and it has been this way since version 2.10.0 Ibrahim Yusuf You're right it crashes on me too makapav I believe, brand accounts/pages were deprecated a long time ago. vwnut13 Creating a new Brand Account is still available on both Google+ and Youtube. Actually, it's not only available, but there is a direct link to create a Brand Account on the Google+ homepage. Suicide_Note Now we just need to be able to manually tag people in a photo. Capt4chris And for search to include shared albums. :-) chris mellor Im on 2.12 and still dont have this feature. johnforamerica Bring back the damn cloud backup icon on individual thumbnails! Since that went away, no way to tell which photos are backed up! (Other than opening each individual photo) Suicide_Note Agreed. It would be nice to have that back. Dennis Ulijn It'll tell you everything's backed up or how many items still need to backed up. I understand not every solution is perfect for everyone, but what would the clutter of a cloud symbol in each photo solve? johnforamerica It would solve exactly what I described. I selectively back up, I don't want everything backed up. With a library of thousands of pictures, you tell me how to figure out which have not yet been backed up... As it functions now, I have NO IDEA what is backed up or not unless I use one of two crappy options: 1) Click on each pic individually to view the cloud icon showing backup status 2) Try to cross reference my device photos with the web version to see "what's missing" It seems pretty clear to me that Google wants to push its users to use the auto backup function, and this is just another step in trying to compel that usage. Dennis Ulijn Okay, fair enough. Thomas Stockx Is this a US only feature? I've been using Google Photo's for ages on my Nexus 6, 6P, and Pixel, but Google is unable to give me search results for any name. Dennis Ulijn Yes. Use a VPN to enable it once, and then it keeps working. You'd have to put in the names yourself though, but after that it keeps adding photos of that person. Florian Reisinger Where to enable it? Dennis Ulijn I think it's the option called 'face grouping'. I use tunnelbear to create a vpn to america. Ailín Ó’S Apparently it's against EU law or something to do that so it's not in Europe. But once you enable it once it works always. rumanuu76 Yep I visited USA, it started working and now always works 😎 towo Still not available in Germany. *sigh* Fruity101079 With a VPN (or chrome extension), fake your location and access google photos , you will be able to enable it. towo Doesn't seem to populate any face matches, though, or does it just take a long time? Jack Smith I need to be able to tag my pets Fruity101079 We still can't change the location of the picture (don't know why, some of them are completely wrong...) thespacecowboy This has been a feature for a long time. Go to Assistant, then Search, then it'll bring a long horizontal list of photos. Click on those, and it will bring all the people it 'knows'. Click on someone it doesn't know and name them, and it'll tag those people in all your photos so you can search them. therealbiglou Yes, we are all aware. This isn't the point of this article. Rita El Khoury That's not what this is. Re-read the post please. thespacecowboy But Rita. Reading is hard! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/1849b9b0acd9cc0f34a50f0fb75f93662013c9cd00535267a4111a9bffb739c5.jpg 4Ui812 Reading is easy , comprehension is hard. Cecil Hardwood This only works for faces/people Google sees. I have lots of photos that for whatever reason Google has not identified any people in them or maybe 1 out of 3. It would be nice to be able to go back and add the ones Google missed. 4Ui812 You're a good looking lady Rita. It's a nice picture , you should use this one as your avatar. Peter Garlinski I'm assuming you're going to get at least a couple good bottles of beer for giving your friend publicity. Rita El Khoury Given how many times I've screenshotted stuff with him in it, I have to ask for at least one Pixel XL :p Vinayak Prabhu This is completely off topic. I noticed that you are using a S7 Edge.. How has it hold up after a year? Is there noticeably lag every now and then? m33d Rita's eyebrows be lookin' "on fleek!" Rita El Khoury Had to Google that. Thanks :) Kevin Chapple But, regrettably STILL not available in the UK.. ANY idea when this will be 'fixed' for the UK? jwildman16 Some others here stated that you can enable a VPN to a U.S. location, start adding names to faces, and then it will continue to do so after the VPN is disconnected. Matthew Merrick Doesn't matter. My Google Photos facial recognition wipes itself every 2 weeks for some godforsaken reason, rendering the service's most useful ability irrelevant, considering it rebuilds at not even one photo per day. Divya Pant Valuable information on Google Photos. Looking forward to seeing your notes posted. The information you have posted is very useful. Keep going on, good stuff.

An Israeli security researcher takes a good look at Samsung's Tizen, labels it the worst code he has ever seen Jordan Palmer Follow View All Posts 2017/04/04 11:26am PDTApr 4, 2017 64 Plus 1 on G+ 276 Share on Facebook 74 Share on Twitter Total Shares414 News Samsung Android is a hulking beast as far as global user share is concerned — hell, it's the most-used operating system in the world, surpassing even Windows (in terms of internet usage). When Samsung announced that it was creating its own open-source alternative to Google's mobile OS, it was not really a surprise. We've had several upstarts over the years, like Sailfish, Firefox OS, Ubuntu Touch, and so on, but all of them have failed in some form or another. There were a few people, however, who thought Sammy could be the one to unseat Google and Android with a mobile operating system that it called Tizen. Whether it's pronounced TEE-zen or TIE-zen is still a mystery (Wikipedia and I say it's the latter), but up until now, word on the integrity and security of the code has been relatively scant. Israeli researcher Amihai Neiderman finally dove into Tizen's guts to see what he could find. According to his report to Motherboard, what he found wasn't good. Niederman claims that the operating system contains what "may be the worst code [he's] ever seen" with signs of amateur mistakes/practices and no less than 40 zero-day vulnerabilities. All of those 40 allow for remote-code execution, which permits nefarious parties to access and assume varying levels of control of a Tizen device. Remember, there are quite a few devices running Samsung's OS, including the Gear smartwatches and some phones. One of the most critical vulnerabilities was in the Tizen Store (the equivalent of the Play Store or App Store), which allowed Niederman to inject malicious code into his Samsung TV (also running Tizen). His conclusion from this was that you as a hypothetical third-party could "update a Tizen system with any malicious code you want." Even the store's authentication measures weren't enough — he just used a heap-overflow vulnerability (which he also discovered) to hijack the software before the security protocols activated. Moving on, Niederman says that Tizen's code base is quite outdated and even borrows some elements from Bada, its predecessor. However, he claims that most of the issues he found were in the new code, which was written in the last two years or so. Some of the mistakes are those one might find programmers making twenty years ago. As Motherboard puts it, this shows that Sammy lacks any basic code development or review practices. To prove his point, Niederman points to one example that he claims was everywhere in Tizen, strcpy(). Basically, strcpy() is a flawed function that is easily exploitable and is not used anymore because of that, yet it is supposedly prevalent in Tizen. To top everything off, Niederman says that the programmers failed to use SSL encryption in certain areas during specific data transmissions. This led him to conclude that they made the wrong assumptions on what needed to be encrypted and purposefully left out SSL in those places. When he initially reached out to Samsung to declare his findings, he was greeted with an automated response. Motherboard's attempts to contact the Korean conglomerate resulted only in the basic PR drivel about the company's focus on security and whatnot. However, after the original article got published, Sammy reached out again to Motherboard to claim that it was working with Niederman to resolve the issues, who corroborated this by saying he was in talks with the corporation. You can read more at the source link below if you're interested. Honestly, I can't say that I'm too surprised. As Mr. Niederman puts it, Samsung should reconsider deploying Tizen to its appliances and future phones before doing a serious overhaul on the code. I find that I agree with him.

(Sarcasm) JohnyNoLegs Lazy coding by coders....SHOCKER!!!! (Sarcasm because even google/apple has shitty code haha) F4LL0U7 But by all means, let's spend $900 on the new Galaxy phone, because I'm sure it's both immune to their terrible code, and totally worth the price tag. Ome Dries The S8 doesn't use Tizen though, so your phone should be safe... your Samsung powered fridge is a different story Leonardo Baez Or their line of smartwatch John Doe Yeah but they probably use the same programmers for Tizen and Android. kalehv I wouldn't think so. Tizen and Android are very very different inside out. demarcmj Probably not the same programmers, but the culture, processes, etc. are probably the same. Just this. the general attitude can't (and won't) be different MJ No... The Android and Tizen programmers are most certainly on different teams and only deal with their platform. This does not mean Samsung as a whole is good at software. John Doe We don't know if they really are on different teams unless Samsung told you. MJ I wouldn't know if Samsung employs cows for programmers unless they told me but I can almost guarantee the teams are separate. Programming teams at any company tend to specialize on ONE project at a time. It's not the same guys... There will be a small number of top programmers who will move from team to to team to fix problems or help with deadlines. John Doe "I can almost guarantee the teams are separate" No you can't unless you are an employee there and know what Samsung is doing. Samsung is not your typical silicon valley tech company so I have no idea how they work. MJ It's funny your whole argument is there is no way we can know how they do it at Samsung yet you had no problem making the statement the Android and Tizen programmers are probably the same which would be a totally unusual setup for any company with large programmer teams. Why not just go with they are probably cows which is why their software is so bad. LOL John Doe They probably are cows :) F4LL0U7 Right, but my point is that their code is crap, and they're making tons of "enhancements" to the Android OS, plus the dozens of Google apps they unnecessarily duplicate. Their terrible code makes a huge impact on the Android ecosystem. tim242 They don't unnecessarily duplicate anything. Samsung has many apps that are far superior to Google's bloatware. John Doe https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e46717cc007988df31954f458f30b8b237b2c4e803101752d08debfaa155bcf3.gif tim242 Samsung Pay>Android Pay Samsung Browser>Chrome John Doe Samsung pay is greater how exactly? And no on the browser I used Samsung's browser it is not as good as chrome. tim242 Ummm I can use Samsung Pay everywhere. As for the browser, you are full of shit. John Doe Umm that is hardware not software, Samsung bought looppay to do that and it has nothing to do with Samsung's software. Chrome is the most used browser in the world...facts. tim242 It is hardware and software, you know like Android Pay uses NFC. You aren't very smart. As for the browser, since when does most used equal best? McDonald's burgers are the most popular burgers, but nobody will claim them to be the best. Do better. John Doe Wow lmao. Looppay uses MST like your credit card so very little software is needed for it to work. You just need to store credit card information. with NFC there is more communications on both ends and more authentication is required. It is more secure than Magnetic strips. But at the end of the day when it comes to software Apple pay and Android Pay are much better (Design, speed, ease of use, etc) I have used Samsung's browser it is featureless. Chrome has a lot of features that I use and it is fast. I save my passwords in chrome, I have data saver, Read later, cached pages for quick reload, Google AMP, autofill is synced, better privacy controls and Do Not Track, Google translate embedded, and fine grain controls for sites accessing camera, microphone, notifications, etc. Samsung's browser is small potatoes compared to Chrome. AbbyZFresh If you've used Samsung's browser, then you would know it's speed >>>>> Chrome is well worth less features in the way John Doe Bitch please you are a bigger troll than Tim and you are a Google hater. Why are you even here? tim242 Your ignorance/stupidity is really showing. MST uses tokenization just the same as NFC. You should educate yourself before commenting about something you know nothing about. Samsung Pay is superior, deal with it. Samsung's browser is lighter, and has more features. You can log into sites with your fingerprint. Try that in Chrome. You can also use an ad blocker plugin. Try that in Chrome. Oh, and it is Chromium based. That means it has a lot of Chrome features as well. Do better John Doe What does tokenization have to do with using the app? We are comparing Samsung Pay with Android pay here and you said samsung pay is better because you can use it anywhere that has nothing to do with samsung pay dumbass that is looppay which samsung bought. It has nothing to do with the actual software. When it comes to the actual app the design, speed and ease of use of Android and Apple pay is better than samsung pay. Chrome still has a lot more features that the two you mentioned. But I can't change the mind of an ignorant troll. A troll is a troll is a troll. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/70cffa9c6cf517883f23a7ea527e30ffa7ecb7b3f6c82e8599d47b0b1cca584e.gif tim242 LoopPay does not exist. Samsung bought it and incorporated it into Samsung Pay, which makes it better than Android Pay. Tokenization means it is not insecure, as you claimed. You are the obvious troll. You make no sense at all. John Doe Looppay is a hardware feature it has very little to do with the app that is like saying I can use 3.5mm headphones with my music app compared to the iPhone. It is a hardware feature but the app at the end of the day is judged separate from that. You are truly fucken moron and deserve a note 7. tim242 LoopPay was the name of a company that no longer exists. MST was bought by Samsung and is part of Samsung Pay. Hardware can't work without software. Why you are trying to separate the two, is beyond me. Take the tech that Google bought from SoftCard/ISIS out of Android Pay, and see how far that NFC chip gets you. You are now on block, as your stupidity is too much for me. John Doe Samsung bought looppay and its patents so you can't have MST on other devices. We are comparing Samsung with Google here so you have to compare only the software not the harware (This whole fucken article is about software and samsung's incompetence). You are fucken retarted Softcard/ISIS was bought for Google wallet not Android pay and it was because carriers blocked Google wallet so Google bought softcard which was made by the carriers. Samsung pay sucks, period. "Samsung Pay's security measures are based on Samsung Knox and ARM TrustZone technologies; credit card information is stored in a secure token.[3] Payments must be authenticated using a fingerprint scan.[6][7] In August 2016, security researcher Salvador Mendoza disclosed a potential flaw with Samsung Pay, arguing that its security tokens were not sufficiently randomized and could become predictable. He also designed a handheld device that could be used to skim magnetic secure transmission tokens, and another which could spoof magnetic stripes on actual card readers using the token. Samsung responded to the report, stating that "If at any time there is a potential vulnerability, we will act promptly to investigate and resolve the issue".[8]" http://www.zdnet.com/article/flaw-in-samsung-pay-lets-hackers-wirelessly-skim-credit-cards/ Middlefinger Just because people are forced to use chrome on Android it doesnt mean its the best. Its the new IE, its terrible on mobile and hardly better on desktop. MJ Who are these people who are forced to use Chrome on Android? John Doe They are not forced to use it. Chrome doesn't come preloaded on desktop but it is still the number one because people go and download it. And it doesn't come preloaded on all Android phones. Middlefinger Yes, it is on every Android phone. If people chose Chrome over Firefox then thats their own problem and its not like FF is perfect either. John Doe It is not on every Android phone. And they choose it because they like it and want to use it. Middlefinger Its compulsory according to the Android licensing agreement, if you want Google play access. John Doe The play store is not on every Android phone...its not on any phone in china for example and the Mobile Application Distribution Agreement is optional and Google chrome is not even set to default and is hidden in a folder on Samsung devices so no one is forcing anyone to do anything here. Middlefinger Its on every phone that has access to the play store. What china does is not relevant to this so dont deflect. You know full well what i was referring to, not that it will stop you claiming victory as is usual on here. Its not hidden, its right on the damn home screen on international unlocked OEM devices. John Doe You said "*EVERY* android phone has Google Chrome". There are plenty of Android phones that do not sign that agreement and do not have the play store on them also the agreement is negotiated with Google including what apps to include. This agreement is also signed with carriers so Google, OEMs and the carriers negotiate it. And yes it is hidden in the US carrier version because I had to go through the app list, open the folder, click on it to use it and also have to make it default...it is not set to default. This was on an S7 edge. https://landing.google.com/intl/en/androidisforusers/faq.html https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-4a46Ko8RE Middlefinger Newsflash, the world doesnt revolve around US carriers.. On the first point.. well done, you won on a technicality that neither of us were even talking about anyway. John Doe That is where OEMs sell the majority of their phones through carriers and specifically US carriers not international unlocked phones which samsung doesn't even update on time (But that is another issue). But even in the international unlocked phone I am sure the S7 also does not have chrome as the default browser. Middlefinger My Samsung devices do, as did my LGs, HTCs and so on (including network branded ones). Some US carriers may have other things installed and set to default, but its the exception in the world. Either way Google requires its bloat be installed, and i dont see that as any better than Samsungs. John Doe You may think is bloat but the billions of Google users out there do not think so go download what you like. Shame-sung C.E.O Swinesung Pay is Garbage. Don't fall for this guys Sheep Mentallity. This is the same person who said CURRENT-C was going to be the winner out of Payment wars LOL!! No joke he was the biggest shill for Months. Shame-sung C.E.O https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d20aef0fbc504aadabb8bd8fde48166d56c8b76806fd4b9f3e699fb0f3c88c9a.jpg https://media.giphy.com/media/l3E6uhDAN3W7vylji/giphy.gif LMFAO!!! LineOS for exynos! I know Samsung browser is based on chromium... But he say 'better' becouse ad blocker... If chrome have ad blocker is will be faster.. that for sure Suicide_Note Two hardly qualifies as 'many apps'. tim242 That was just two examples. Another example is Messages. I have to use Samsung Messages, because Google forces pop up messages, unless you silence them altogether. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages all the time, but I'm not aware of any pop-up messages. Or are you referring to the way the message notification pops up? tim242 Yes, the notifications. Google took the option out of the settings to disable that nonsense. Samsung put the option into their app. Why is Google forcing that on us? It is annoying to have them interrupt what I am doing, and disregards privacy Suicide_Note I like it since i can see if i need to reply immediately or not, or just dismiss it to the notification tray, but to each their own. Good thing we have so many options to choose from. 😊 tim242 Yeah, I would use Google Messenger, if only I could disable that. Knowing Google, they may add that back later. JohnyNoLegs Google doesn't even have an audio recording app LOL. Google has barely anything. Literally BARE Middlefinger amung browser is superior to chrome. A carrier Pigeon is better than chrome, at least Samsung internet actually exits properly when you press the back button. John Doe So go use a carrier pigeon...troll LoL If you like Samsung and their programming skills go buy a Tizen phone Middlefinger I prefer Samsung to Google anyway. Android is a damn mess and getting worse again. Sure 7 is better than the total disaster that was kitkat, but its worse than anything since KK. John Doe Ok so go get a Tizen phone http://www.samsung.com/in/smartphones/samsung-z3/ Middlefinger I prefer Samsungs mods to Android to Googles 'stock', Samsung actually seem to test it before breaking everyone devices. John Doe That is because everyone's device is already broken (Laggy, buggy, slow, and filled with unnecessary apps). Middlefinger Like most of the Google apps, yeah you're right. John Doe Google's apps are updated continually and are stable than the majority of OEM apps since they are mostly updated by OTA instead of through the play store like all of Google's apps. Anyways, that doesn't change the fact that Samsung's software is laggy and terrible...it also gets worse over time which is just sad. And the fact that they take forever to update their phones does not help your argument. Middlefinger Firstly thats horseshit, Google apps are just as unstable as any. Secondly Samsungs launcher can be laggy, jsut like Googles can be painfully limited, so dont use either. The rest of the Samsung mods are better than Googles, especially the notification pulldown. Ive already addressed the update thing. If Google was pushing 7.1.1 to every device in the world there would be hundreds of millions that randomly rebooted. The OEMs test better and it takes time. Older thats stable and fixed is better than newer and broken. John Doe Firstly thats horseshit, Google apps are just as unstable as any. I use Google's apps daily and they are not unstable actually they are highly rated in the play store compared to samsung's apps and are used by way more people that just shows how stable they are. Unless you are using beta version, heck even the beta version is stable so I have no idea what you are talking about. There are always problems with updates even Apple has them with iOS but the difference is Google can push out a fix quickly like Apple. Also with new updates you get security patches and fixes for older bugs that take months to fix when going through OEMs and carriers. If you think Samsung's programming is good go check the article you are commenting on LoL. Middlefinger So what if google can and does patch things quickly, it shouldn't get broken in the first place. This just doesn't happen with most OEM devices, and hasnt to a single one ive ever had. My Nexus devices have been a string of bad hardware, poor software, show stopping faults and RMAs. John Doe I have had several nexus devices and pixel and I have never had severe problems to a point where I had to send it in. There are bugs like any other OEM especially samsung but Google has the ability to fix them quickly. Newflash, it does happen with a lot of OEMs including Apple. This isn't new anyways Google's software is highly praised on the pixel compared to Samsung's "horseshit". Go check the reviews. Middlefinger Im sure the 9 people that have a Pixel just loved the reboots. Nice its fixed, shame it ever happened. Never had severe problem eh? Ive never had ANY with anything except the Nexus'. Highly praised is it? By who exactly? If its the same people that bought the Nexus then they are easily pleased and highly biased. You cant deny there is an entire body of fanboys out there that love AOSP, regardless of how bad it is. If google just secretly used all Samsungs code for 8 it would be the best thing ever, because bias blinds. John Doe 9 people? classy. Nice joke. Never had severe problem eh? Ive never had ANY with anything except the Nexus'. You just lost all credibility just stop. All the tech blogs gave it excellent reviews and said it was the best Android phone available even tech blogs that favor Apple said so and that says a lot. Middlefinger Yeah, OK. Zero Mizukami What didnt you like about kitkat? I was always under the impression kitkat was more or less the pinnacle of Android Audio Totally disagree. There are no Samsung apps on my S7 that I actually use. tim242 That's you. I use Samsung Pay every day, to pay for everything. Samsung's browser is far superior to Chrome. I use Samsung's SMS app, because Google forces pop up messages on theirs. F4LL0U7 That's your opinion, and of course I have my own. It was just a little frustrating when I started my work GS7 for the first time and saw two of nearly every app. As a Nexus/Pixel guy, I'm horrified at Samsung's terrible (in my opinion) design and functionality standards. Not to mention the 3rd party garbage they toss in there too. I had to purchase an app that allows me to disable their default apps. When your first task in the process of setting up a new phone is to wade through and remove the bloat, there's something wrong there. tim242 I purchased a package disabler as well. But I also had to disable a lot of Google bloatware as well. John Doe You need to look up the term bloatware. Lookup, Microsoft office, facebook, and all the other unnecessary apps that don't need to be preinstalled are bloatware. Anyways I don't know what I am arguing with you samsung phones are burning up...literally so unless samsung sells 100+ million s8 they will always be behind apple. tim242 Behind apple haha you are silly. John Doe Why is that silly? They are behind Apple in the smartphone business. tim242 That is not true. Get educated, then comment. John Doe Lmao http://www.techtimes.com/articles/188124/20161208/apple-iphone-7-is-the-best-selling-smartphone-in-us-trumping-the-samsung-galaxy-s7-kantar.htm https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/56f89a4335e2c7fe807cdebf208e142c62b61a5cec127b30c1f4b3c96aee3961.gif tim242 Lmao that is just the S7. Samsung has many other smartphones. You are trying to move the goalposts. Try harder John Doe http://bgr.com/2017/02/03/apple-vs-samsung-sales-2016/ http://www.businessinsider.com/samsung-galaxy-apple-iphone-premium-market-share-chart-2016-12 https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/10/16/samsung-galaxy-vs-iphone-which-product-line-has-so.aspx Apple beat Samsung with 3 Phones....Samsung had 31. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/13806899d2dd953b00745e25586ce63bc99bfb72ae0d42ccd3bbb42fa9c618b5.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78dd8b407e1ea19bc331dea202aae34c0cb0772bea409ff56a11d2efb86e7f9d.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/91444a76a0ec89e25770a31b864244d9c04aad4f64e7c6152e993058b5c82bb9.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/688053d5bd7c128160ba9a9dfe79639b542955188e91c63913e08ee14faa1f85.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e9eb24fa3eae7253df33b2eb97d2250c7c498213eec6de868a759657891aad6b.png JohnyNoLegs Yea like Pixel Launcher, Hangouts, Daydream haha byteseyes Google apps are definitely bloatware. There's tons of Google bloatware I delete every time I get a new device with Android on it. Granted, I think Samsung and Google should get a pass for including their software because it's Samsung's hardware and part Samsung and part Google's software. Completely 3rd party companies like carriers or Microsoft stuffing their software is the worst kind of bloatware. John Doe Google apps are not bloatware because people do use them and they are useful. Bloatware means apps that people don't use and waste space on your device. Google's apps definitly do not waste space and the majority of them are used so no they are not bloatware. These are the apps Google requires most are Google play apps: Google Chrome Google Maps Google Drive YouTube Gmail Google+ (The only one I think is unnecessary) Google Play Music Google Play Movies Google Play Books Google Play Newsstand Google Play Games Google Photos Hangouts (Probably stopped requiring it already) byteseyes Your conclusion that Google apps are not bloatware rests on the premise that people use them. By the same token, Samsung apps are not bloatware because people do use them and they are useful. Realistically, I can count on 2 hands the number of people I've come across who use Google Play Music, Movies, Books, Newsstand, Games, Photos, Hangouts, and Google+. Most people I know do use YouTube and Maps the most, while Chrome is forced onto people often. Drive is a wash. That means almost all of Google's apps are not commonly used, hence waste space. So don't you think it's unfair and untrue to make the assumption that people use Google apps, while simultaneously making the unfair and untrue assumption that people don't use Samsung apps? I personally love Samsung apps and I find most of Google's apps redundant. I can understand if people are vice versa. Haha, sorry, I didn't mean this response to be too long, so all boiled down, Samsung and Google apps are either both bloatware or both not. Hope you can understand that they can not be different. John Doe Fact is that far more people use Google's apps than Samsung's you can check the play store reviews and how many people use them. Google's services are used way more often than Samsung's that is a known fact. Google and Samsung do not release numbers of every single app but Google has a billion+ monthly active users on some of their services. When it comes to the Google play apps, they come in a package with the play store. It makes no fucken sense to have a music section in the play store and no app to play it with. They are a package. Chrome is not "forced" on people. You need to lookup what that word means and Chrome is not even set as default on samsung devices so how the hell is it "forced"? That means almost all of Google's apps are not commonly used, hence waste space. It is silly to make a statement like that So don't you think it's unfair and untrue to make the assumption that people use Google apps, while simultaneously making the unfair and untrue assumption that people don't use Samsung apps? No because like stated above Google has more than billion+ active users on their services and highly rated apps in the play store and they a regularly updated. Samsung on the other hand has even discontinued multiple apps and services because no one is using them like Samsung milk music. https://play.google.com/store/apps/collection/search_results_cluster_apps?clp=ggEJCgdzYW1zdW5n:S:ANO1ljLMiXA https://play.google.com/store/apps/collection/search_results_cluster_apps?clp=ggEICgZnb29nbGU%3D:S:ANO1ljIY5oM Bloatware apps are determined by the user and I am positive that more users find Google's apps in a favorable light than Samsung's. You are in the minority. byteseyes "Fact is that far more people use Google's apps than Samsung's you can check the play store reviews and how many people use them. Google's services are used way more often than Samsung's that is a known fact. Google and Samsung do not release numbers of every single app but Google has a billion+ monthly active users on some of their services." YouTube and Maps are the most popular. The majority of Google apps are not used at all by most people. But that doesn't matter. The point is lots of people use Google apps, and lots of people use Samsung apps too. You can't ignore one group of people even if it's one order of magnitude smaller. It's still a significant number. "When it comes to the Google play apps, they come in a package with the play store. It makes no fucken sense to have a music section in the play store and no app to play it with. They are a package." Many people don't use them. I'm just using your own assumption and logic. I personally deleted them. Whether it makes sense or not to include them is irrelevant. Of course from a company's perspective it almost always makes sense to include their own service. That's business. You're inclined to make justifications for Google but not for others. "Chrome is not "forced" on people. You need to lookup what that word means and Chrome is not even set as default on samsung devices so how the hell is it "forced"?" It's not forced on Samsung devices thank god. But anyway, instead of on smartphones, I was just remembering off the top of my head about the Chrome browser slipping its way into many people's computers, so I was going off a tangent there. "It is silly to make a statement like that" It's pure logic. "No because like stated above Google has more than billion+ active users on their services and highly rated apps in the play store and they a regularly updated. Samsung on the other hand has even discontinued multiple apps and services because no one is using them like Samsung milk music." Again, that's not the case for almost all of Google's apps. Most of Google's apps are not commonly used. Google also discontinues or leaves as zombies apps that no one uses. "Bloatware apps are determined by the user" That's what I've been saying all along. "and I am positive that more users find Google's apps in a favorable light than Samsung's. You are in the minority." Of course a software-centric company is going to have a larger user base. I may be in the minority, but it's still a large number of people. We're not talking about 1 user vs 1 million. If there's 1 user, and an app is installed to cater to that one 1 user, then it would be bad to include the app. But many, many, many people use Samsung apps too. You can't cherry pick what you like and ignore everything that others like. John Doe Exactly so going back to my original comment that Google's apps are not bloatware and that apps from Facebook, Microsoft, and Lookout are bloatware. Also when Samsung has two music apps like Google play music and Milk on their devices and they end up discontinuing Milk because no one uses it that is also bloatware. So I am glad we cleared up your confusion on whether Google's apps are "definitly bloatware" https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/04d006e4bd2b9525b0b0e9550444617ee69614c33bf605ad372243dc9af02410.png byteseyes Logic must not be your strong suit. John Doe Good Job nice comeback byteseyes Thanks. byteseyes I can understand your viewpoint. Me personally, I find most of Google's apps redundant because I really love Samsung's apps. I actually did the same as you haha! I purchased an app to delete all of Google's apps except Youtube and Maps and a few of Samsung's too. I think there are people who use Samsung apps and people who use Google apps. Not referring to you, but some people like to think Google apps are not bloatware because they themselves use them. But many people also love and use Samsung apps, myself included. Even though I love Samsung apps, I can totally understand if people are vice versa. Logically speaking, either both Samsung and Google apps are both bloatware or both not. dabug91 Lol, umm Samsung has it's own calendar app, calculator app, memo app, messaging app, etc and they're all shit. No phone has more bloatware than a Samsung phone. They win hands-down in that category. tim242 I prefer all of those to Google's offerings. I'm glad to have a choice. OligarchyAmbulance You honestly think they have higher standards for their lagfest Android skin? tim242 They have higher standards than Google/HTC with the dumpster fire that is Pixel. John Doe https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a1405ef722a16da1e676294296d43a0d524eaaf5c53be0f4ec6d89b9ab035eb1.gif M. Luciano What? Where are you getting all this? tim242 There have been numerous hardware issues reported since release. Some of which being the microphone, speakers, camera, and the display. tekfr33kn I've had my Pixel for a few months now and haven't had a single one of those problems. I know that a few people have had them but it's more rare than you you are making it out to be. Audio Or for Knox for that matter! Bob http://imgur.com/gallery/UrhOtai Middlefinger No it uses Android, which we all know is perfect/ s ... At least Samsung fixes the mess Google creates most of time though. Jumanji! Are you perhaps conflating user experience with quality/security of code? A company can make something look pretty or function, but that doesn't mean there aren't any issues with the security of their code. Computer science isn't an exact science and creating software is always a series of trade offs. Middlefinger No im basing it on all the problem Google has with its own devices and how much time OEMs have to spend fixing Google code before they release it on their own devices. Jumanji! What do you expect? Android is a big, complex platform and there are a number of OEMs who blend it with their own, unique hardware variations and services. It's absolutely normal for customers to find defects in shipping products. It's ultimately how the company reacts to customer facing defects and issues that really matters. I'd love to see a list of the volume of defects that OEMs have fixed in the Android platform. I think data has the potential of strengthening your arguments rather than having them appear to be nothing but hyperbole. Middlefinger Not all fixes they make is committed back to stock. Much of what the OEMs do is proprietary, but given that OEM devices dont have the problems AOSP based devices do its reasonable to say they fixed something. If all the Google devices had identical hardware you could argue the problem is which specific hardware, but thats not the case. Regardless of the hardware the problem persists because the problems are in Googles code. Zsolt V You are right in everything you wrote. Congrats, finally a sane voice. F4LL0U7 If that was sincere and not sarcastic, thanks! JohnyNoLegs Haha doesn't run Tizen. Fail. Google code their own bugs anyway. F4LL0U7 No shit, try reading the rest of the thread. Vivek Rameses That's odd, some people think Israel is worst place humanity has ever seen. Sruly J Do you get a thrill connecting politics go something totally not related to that? Suicide_Note And that has to do with Samsung's poor coding......how, exactly? https://media.giphy.com/media/Qy9hRuWrKjY2I/giphy.gif Vivek Rameses Just pointing out facts. Sruly J Which are totally irrelevant to this topic. Vivek Rameses Shouldn't be in the title then. No, shows the credibility of said researcher. Sruly J Because a programmer is in charge of the politics of their country... But tell me; If someone from the US would have revealed these same facts, would you have an issue with it? Especially since they would be stating the same facts. EcE By that logic, all Americans are orange liars with tiny hands. Suicide_Note And some might say that whatever country you're from is the worst but, again, what would that have to do with Samsung's poor coding? marcusmarcus2 In that case, here is a link to 500 useless facts that have the same relevance to this article. You'll love it. http://alturl.com/p749b Shuli81 What's even more odd is that it's a paradise compared to whatever 3rd world country you live in Shane DeRidder More reasons to stick with Android proper, Samsung. Let the Android Developers do their thing as they do it so well. tim242 This has nothing to do with Android... EcE Exactly what he is saying... dump Tizen and stick to Android tim242 I don't think they will be dumping Android. It would be too much of a change for their userbase. But if they were to do that, I would surely dump them. The problem is, I don't care for any other Android manufacturer. HTC is not the proper ODM for Google, too many issues. Drunk Squirrel Did you even read what he said? He clearly said "dump TIZEN", "NOT Android"! Nicholas Conrad I don't think he really reads what anybody says. Drakenoid Which is why I blocked him ages ago and you should too. Middlefinger Yeah, because Android is so great. How many Nexus devices have rebooted randomly today i wonder? MJ That a thing? I don't recall my Nexus 7 which have had for three years ever randomly rebooting. I used a Nexus 5 actively for 2 1/2 years and remember a short period where I had to MANUALLY reboot it a couple of times a week. My Pixel XL has been stable and just as fast/smooth since day one. JohnyNoLegs Pixel XL here, required one RMA, 3 factory resets. Bluetooth is still dodgy. Google Play music is dodgy, it doesn't play for more than 30 mins without stopping audio. LOL at you thinking Google/Nexus?Pixel is any better LOLOLOLOLOL MJ OK, you had a bad phone. So? I have owned more than three Nexus/Pixel devices with no major issues. Regardless, I was responding specifically to the random rebooting issue the OP mentioned that I have never seen. JohnyNoLegs Nexus 5X random reboots. My wife RMA'd it within the first 6 months. 6P battery would die when it got to 30%, RMA'd that and the 6P i got, android system used loads of battery and I would barely get 1.5 hrs SOT even after factory resets. Then bought Note7, was leaps and bounds ahead of the Nexus 5X and 6P, except for the whole risk of exploding....THen I got the Pixel, which yea sure it's always fast at first, but it does so much less than the Note 7, and now my Pixel struggles at points anyway. I have owned every nexus except for the 6, I have also owned nearly all LG G series and Galaxy series. The most Issues I have had are with nexus devices, mostly to do with updates. Airoid Sammy is fu#ked Suicide_Note Hardly. It just means they'll be using Android for a good while longer. shadowx360 Samsung has at least matched (or surpassed) Apple in terms of design and manufacturing of hardware, but is Chinese-OEM level when it comes to software. Articles like these are why I stick with Pixel/Nexus devices. If they want to be taken seriously, they need to find competent software engineers - the GS8 announcement articles were shortly followed by articles showing you can beat the new facial recognition by using a flat photo. Suicide_Note To be fair, you can fool Google's facial recognition with a photo, too. OligarchyAmbulance To be fair, you can't unless you have a photo which blinks. Suicide_Note It's not at all hard to create a photo that 'blinks'. M. Luciano lol? for muggles? Ian Santopietro That actually blinks? No, that's impossible. But it's not hard to make a photo which tricks the software into thinking it blinked, which is why I assume that guy put 'blinks' in single-quotes. Suicide_Note You get it. Thank you. Carson Saldanha He's a wizard bruh Carson Saldanha Yes, that is "Smart Lock" and if I'm not mistaken, I think Google even put a warning of this. They also didn't advertise this as a "feature". Abhilash Bingi TBF Google also introduced the Face Unlock feature back in 2011 (with ICS and the Galaxy Nexus) which could be fooled by a photo. But it warned you that it's not completely safe and can be fooled by a photo when you tried to activate it. Joannaescott Google is paying $97 per hour!

Google likes to whip things up quick and throw spaghetti on the wall to see what sticks. There's lots of mistakes in that process. Also, Samsung specifically stated face unlock is not intended to be a secure locking method. They specifically said it's analogous to slide to unlock, so I don't understand why people are misunderstanding this as a "security flaw" when it's not. Justin That's why Google removed Face Unlock in Lollipop. Abhilash Bingi What? No. It just got renamed to 'Trusted face' and moved to Smart Lock along with 'Trusted places' location and 'Trusted Devices'. It's still an option on my Pixel. OligarchyAmbulance Same here. If this is how they treat their own OS, I have no hope for their version of Android. You're lucky if you even get a security patch from them. byteseyes Samsung's the only company out of all manufacturers that releases monthly security patches actually. Pretty awesome. OligarchyAmbulance No, Google does too. byteseyes I mentioned out of all manufacturers. Google's not a manufacturer. That's why I was pointing out that it makes Samsung special. OligarchyAmbulance The Pixel, Pixel C, Chromebook Pixel, Home, Chromecast, Chromecast Audio, Google WiFi, and Daydream would disagree with you. byteseyes Um, I thought it was quite obvious we're talking about phones, given that we're discussing Android and monthly security patches on smartphones. What does a laptop or a router have anything to do with smartphones? Besides, the Pixel phone was not manufactured by Google. Regardless, this doesn't change my original statement that Samsung is the only manufacturer that releases monthly security patches (for their smartphones, in case I wasn't explicit enough), and nobody considers Google a manufacturer, even with Google's nascent foray into the fringe hardware products you listed. In time, Google may become a manufacturer too. Who knows. OligarchyAmbulance "Google's not a manufacturer." "Um, I thought it was quite obvious we're talking about phones" Google is a manufacturer of many devices. That was the point. "Besides, the Pixel phone was not manufactured by Google" Right, and iPhones are made by Foxconn. So technically speaking, Apple has never updated an Apple device. byteseyes Um, you do realize you're arguing about absolutely nothing right now? I never denied Google updates their phone. I already knew Google updates their phone. I was stating that Samsung, a phone manufacturer, is the only OEM that releases monthly security patches, a direct contradiction to your initial statement "You're lucky if you even get a security patch from them." OligarchyAmbulance "Samsung, a phone manufacturer, is the only OEM that releases monthly security patches" They're the only OEM if you don't include another OEM. lol byteseyes Google's an OEM? Apple's OEM? That's news to everyone. tim242 Android's face unlock was the same. Besides, Samsung tells you that it is low security. You are just a nasty google sheep. EcE While I don't disagree, it's been 5 or 6 years. If Samsung was going to implement it, at least try harder. My guess is that it was a last minute addition due to the rumored onscreen fingerprint sensor they had to ditch. Shame-sung C.E.O Says the Current-C Shill who is a sheep to Swinesung now. Carson Saldanha Have I ever agreed on anything with you? tim242 I am not sure. But you should more often : ) Carson Saldanha -___________________________________________- Shame-sung C.E.O This has nothing to do with Apple. SWINESUNG is a huge dishonest,Corrupt,Horrible company who will be always known for stealing , profit, sued, settle. Speculation on what Apple is going to do = Nothing. The sad Truth is that Pathetic TIZEN Garbage OS will always be a Rip off iOS,Android & Windows and WebOS . Swinesung does nothing Original and does it half baked like all its product. FAIL FAIL FAIL. Peter World Citizen Your Korean boyfriend left you recently? ;) Shame-sung C.E.O why are you sharing what your mother told you? Kind of random LOL!! Defenestratus Google's software development isn't by any means stellar either. John Doe It is definitly more secure than Samsung and better designed. Google has a project zero team so find security flaws and it works great...I wonder why they haven't looked at Tizen OS lmao Zsolt V It's by not stellar you mean that it's the best out of all commercial companies you are right.... QwertyJuan To be fair... if you lose your phone, there is a HIGH chance that the person finding it has NO idea who you are, doesn't possess any pictures of you, thereby making the facial recognition feature a decent level of security. No... it won't stop your younger brother or one of your friends from "hacking" your phone when you are asleep. :) P.S. Samsung ALSO has a retina scanner built into the phone which is actually MORE secure than even a fingerprint scanner and for some reason we hear NOTHING about this feature. whispy_snippet It's less secure for the very reasons you just outlined. It's easier to get a photo of someone than their fingerprint. Drakenoid Not if you're a common thief, then it's easier to get their fingerprints off the phone than their pic. whispy_snippet I'm sceptical that a common thief has the tools and/or technical know-how to obtain and then exploit someone's finger print. It's not easy. Drakenoid True, but it's then also unlikely for them to get photo of the owner. My name is…. Oh yes, the classic douche that says "that's why i stick with Pixel/Nexus devices" Because Android was never full of holes or the Pixel deserves the iphone-like price tag. Zsolt V It's better than an iPhone, so why shouldn't it be priced so? Justin You know what's worse than GoPro Sheeps? Nexus Sheeps. YaKillaCJ Hold up now, while I agree that Samsung suck in the software department, I disagree with the Chinese OEM part. Let's not forget that Xiaomi has the best update record, even surpassing Google depending how ya look at it. Also OnePlus has been really good and ZTE not bad at all. Zsolt V What does update speed have anything to do with this topic? jodieisme Security patch..? Zsolt V So Samsung doesn't deliver timely monthly patches? mma173 Xiaomi is a way better than Google. MIUI has so many advantages over the other Android roms. But the one has to admit that they took their "inspiration" from Apple :) especially in the early days. Drakenoid True, I wish they would update the basic usability of MIUI to be more in line with Android, specially now that Android does a lot of things better. They don't have to serve Google's Android just an updated version with better design. I love their features though. Though Xiaomi doesn't provide security patches to Mi 5 as fast as they should. Zsolt V So you 3D print a face, no difference. Adam Truelove Agree, Stock Android managed by Google running on an S8 would be wonderful. Samsung makes great hardware, but absolute garbage software. JohnyNoLegs Samsung states it isn't secure man. SAM I had read about Tizen code and management and no wonder this article makes sense. Read what other programmers had to say abt tizen https://what.thedailywtf.com/topic/15687/code-review-malediction https://what.thedailywtf.com/topic/15001/enlightened Suicide_Note I view Tizen as being akin to the dark language of Mordor, and should never be spoken of. marcusmarcus2 What? Now you just made Tizen sound kinda cool. Jordan Palmer Well done. Bewear Die, T(ouchW)izen, die. YouNex That's why #NeverSamsung JohnyNoLegs Yea, go with some other small company that must have great developers and code review policies...LOL Audio This has always been my fear about tizen and why I can't buy the gear s3 watch, ESPECIALLY for using Samsung Pay. It also makes me wonder about Samsung Knox, tbh... Sruly J Isn't part of Knox incorporated into Android for Work? Audio Is it? I always assumed it was separate... Doesn't Knox pre-date Android for Work? Defenestratus Yes it is integrated into Android's Security apparatus and yes, it pre-dated Android for Work (which as far as I can tell is vaporware). saf1927 Android for Work is useful to use it as way to have multiple app profiles. There's an app on the Play Store that create a work profile you can manage yourself by adding apps, etc. LineOS for exynos! Call island Sruly J Don't remember the article, but this article says that part of Knox was incorporated into Android. http://www.zdnet.com/article/google-samsung-integrate-knox-into-android-eye-enterprise-gains/ Shame-sung C.E.O LMFAO!! For years i been saying the same-thing. TIZEN OS is just pure Trash. Swinesung has always had lower standards then free boostmobile phones and Software that should be on V-Tech phones at the least( no insult to V-tech). How ever we all know Swinesung is not Special and has never been special. It's just a Sheep Mentality. Good thing there is Nexus who gives you Amazing Hardware and Software not Bloatware and Half baked products like the ones Swinesung makes. Another Fail from Swinesung. Aaron Uh, you know Nexus isn't a thing anymore, right? Middlefinger Samsung probably spends so much time fixing Googles mess on Android for its devices that there is no time for Tizen.. tekfr33kn You mean f-ing up Android - Fix'd it for ya. Middlefinger How can they f it up when they make it actually work without causing the phone to reboot randomly. Thats an Android fault that affects a number of totally different devices, its not hardware, its Googles software, again. Googles UX is just getting old now, and while yes, Touchwiz was poor in places Grace UX is far superior to whatever the hell Google is doing. Its more logical, provides more information in a better way and is fully themeable. Adam Margeson Having owned the original Android device (HTC Dream), a Nexus 5 and a Pixel on top of several others, Google's devices tend to be the more stable ones in my experience. It's other OEMs like Sony, HTC and others that tend to have problems because of code they precariously stack on top of Android. I'm not saying that Samsung's is better or worse than others', but Stock Android has been fairly stable for me. As to "Google's UX is getting old now",.. As compared to what? Samsung's is really just a highly integrated theme on top of Google's UX. Sure, the settings are moved around, the quick settings look a little different, etc, but what about General "Android" is getting old? JohnyNoLegs My experience is the opposite. Having had RMA'd my Pixel XL twice, and had to Factory Reset a few more times, that's more than all my phone prior. Given the latest Bluetooth bugs and Google Play Music bugs, I think you are just floating on cloud 9 oblivious to reality. I have come from Samsung, LG and HTC. My Nexus 5x is a whole other story, it has been even worse haha Adam Margeson My normal vehicle doesn't have Bluetooth, but the rentals I used for several weeks during the time (2017 KIA Sonata, 2016 Ford F350 and 2016 Ford Taurus) that the bug was active didn't seem to have any issues - in fact, they were overly aggressive in trying to connect even when I didn't want it to. I also don't generally use Google Play Music. So, no, I haven't been on Cloud Nine, I just haven't had the same issues other people have. That said, I was hit by the audio-clipping-at-loud-volumes bug that was there for a couple months. That was mildly (/s) annoying. I only factory reset my Nexus 5 a handful of times over the 3.5 years that I used it, and that was more a matter of having far too many apps and background services running to the point that I just reset it rather than cleaning it up. I have read AP every day since I found the site back when the Galaxy Nexus was released, and I am well aware of the bugs other people have been having. I count myself lucky that I haven't been seen most of those bugs personally. Middlefinger None of it is 'stacked on top of stock'. Its a replacement for it, the stock code isnt there. Almost all OEM android is virtually a fork, and there is no reason why i cannot be better than Googles version. whispy_snippet This is the guy who labels people "Google shills". Middlefinger Who am I shilling for? Samsung because I have their phone, LG because I have their TV, or Microsoft because i have their Tablet? Maybe im just not happy with the state of Android at the moment.. Nah, i must be a paid Samsung troll obviously. whispy_snippet So? What's your point? I have a Surface, an LG TV and a Pixel. But everyone knows phones are the most important piece of tech a person owns which is why they generate such intense discussion. You seem like a huge Samsung "shill" and a massive hypocrite. Middlefinger Everyone knows that do they? Sure if you say so, maybe if you are 14. Funny ive been accused of being a shill for Google as well, so it seems to to depend on the bias of the accuser, namely, you. whispy_snippet You're kidding. So you disagree that the smartphone is the most important and innovative piece of consumer technology this century? Mate, what planet are you living on? Middlefinger I didnt say it wasnt (it was actually invented last century, but whatever). I said its not the most essential to everyone. whispy_snippet I didn't say it was invented this century, but whatever. The statement "everyone knows" was an unbelievably poor choice of words and I can't believe I actually wrote it. But my broader point that smartphones are the most important piece of consumer technology this century still stands. My other point, that you're a hypocrite, also still stands. whispy_snippet Oh yeah. For sure man. You got it. M. Luciano This makes sense. Samsung doesn't know mobile security. They have Knox, which they purchased and then had fixed by BlackBerry. We have notifications constantly about people's dryers and refrigerators being hacked, their TV's being hacked and the only way they get out of it on Android is because someone else is handling 90%+ of the legwork, ie. Google. JohnyNoLegs Knox is better than AOSP. M. Luciano I don't believe that at all, but even if true, the point was they didn't create that. JohnyNoLegs Why would that matter who created it? keithzg Because it speaks to their ability to write good, secure software, which is what's in question here. JohnyNoLegs Well they didn't write it, so then it should be great then by your logic. You are also ASSUMING, that all dev's/dev teams/products are done by the same people, which would be a huge assumption that is probably very wrong. Samsung didn't even code Tizen anyway. M. Luciano Because if they'd have built it, they'd probably understand something about security. But they bought it and then had BlackBerry improve it. JohnyNoLegs So thats a good thing right? ast00 At the end of the day, it's still Samsung. Not surprised. Rod Samsung and poor software? Not surprised. Marty What else is new? Samsung's not known for quality software. They've gotten better with Touch-Wiz, but that's their pinnacle. Peter World Citizen All compilers should just mark strcpy() as error. ;) bekifft Worse than this, Tizen runs on refrigerators, and all that other "smart" crap. People are connecting this junk to the internet and forgetting about it. This is the kind of stuff that causes problems like Mirai. JohnyNoLegs Linux runs on refrigerators, and all that other smart crap. Are you saying the devs that made all that smart crap did it better? Andy J So..... um...... anyone know what the SmartThings hubs run on then? Are we facing a potential situation where they could be hijacked. D13H4RD2L1V3 Here's something, though. Tizen technically isn't made by Samsung entirely. It's a project within the Linux Foundation and developed and overseen by the Tizen Association. As you'd expect, Samsung is a member, but so are other companies such as Huawei and Intel. Despite that, only Samsung has actually implemented the OS in their products. Given the shocking number of security holes, I can only assume that it was far from ready. Even though Samsung's Android skin is better than previous iterations, I don't particularly hold it in super-high regard because software has never been Samsung's forte. And I think they should make it so soon as their hardware gets better and better. Đức Thành I am not the least bit surprised, but that part about the legacy of Bada OS living on was particularly hilarious. mma173 Software industry especially OSs is a very specialized resource-intensive field. I wish Samsung should give up working on OSs to free up resources. ROB Can he also work on getting Nougat to the unlocked S7s ?

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY Search How to Disable Android’s Traffic Notifications By Cameron Summerson on April 5th, 2017 Google often thinks you want to know what traffic is like nearby, so it sends you a notification. While sometimes helpful, this can also be annoying—especially if you’re not going anywhere. Here’s how to completely disable traffic notifications on Android. It’s actually unclear a lot of times where these notifications are coming from: is it Google Now? Google Maps? Something else? The short answer is: it’s a mixture. Disabling Traffic Notifications in Google Maps The first place you’ll want to start is in Google Maps—this is where the bulk of the notifications are coming from, especially when you’re already driving (regardless of whether or not you’re using GPS navigation). In Maps, slide in from the left side of the screen (or tap the three lines in the upper left corner) to open the menu, then scroll down to Settings. Scroll down this menu until you see Notifications. You can control pretty much all aspects of the notifications Maps will generate here, but we’re focusing on traffic data, so you want the top option. There are three options here: Traffic from nearby events: Road closures, accidents, detours, etc. Traffic nearby: Traffic jams, backups, etc. Driving notifications: ETAs to specific locations—usually Home or Work if you have those set. You can pick and choose here—disable and enable whatever works best for you. That’ll handle most of Google’s unwarranted traffic notifications, but there’s one other place you may want to look. Disabling Traffic Notifications in Google Now You know when you have a Calendar appointment and Google tells you to leave by a certain time to get there before you’re supposed to be? That setting isn’t generated by Google Maps, but instead by Google Now. Here’s how to get rid of that if you’d like. At this point, most phones should have Google Assistant, which is a totally different-but-still-super-similar thing to Google Now. The thing is, if you’re not using the Google Now Launcher, Assistant makes it kind of convoluted to get to to Now. So confusing. If you’re using the Google Now Launcher, simply slide over from the right to the leftmost screen. Otherwise, open the app tray and find the Google app, which is, for all intents and purposes, the Now app at this point. Slide in from the left or tap the three lines in the top left corner to open the menu. Choose Settings. Scroll down and select “Your Feed.” Under the “Get Notified About” section, toggle “Commute and time to leave” to off. This should be the last step in disabling all traffic notifications (assuming you disabled everything in Maps, of course).

I often wonder this. You might contend that an ocean is too vast, too varied for any person to appraise in full, let alone compare to other whole oceans. To you I say: Yes. I’ve just learned (all thanks to @interrobango) that Google Maps lets people leave reviews on oceans. Continents can be reviewed, too: What are these reviews like? Well, most people are joking. Some seem to be earnest. Some have found yet another spot to pollute with racism. Some people are just typing letters into the internet. Every ocean has reviews. So does every continent. As far as I can tell, Google doesn’t let you review Earth as a whole, nor any of its hemispheres. On the other hand, you can review tiny uninhabited Antarctic islands: I’ve never been to Sturge Island, but it does look nice. Vox Media, if you want to expense the trips, I will happily visit all the unreviewed islands on Google Maps and produce comprehensive critiques of each. So anyway, what’s the best ocean? Google doesn’t provide a mean rating, and there are too many reviews for me to justifiably average them by hand while someone is paying me to work, so I just counted up all the five-star reviews as a percentage of total reviews of each ocean, because honestly, if your experience with an unfathomably expansive body of water essential to all life on Earth didn’t merit 5 stars, were you really satisfied? Atlantic: 176 five-star reviews out of 332 total = 53% Ocean Satisfaction Pacific: 210/415 = 51% Ocean Satisfaction Indian: 128/234 = 55% Ocean Satisfaction Arctic: 63/145 = 45% Ocean Satisfaction The best ocean is the Indian Ocean. The Arctic Ocean sucks. Here is an example of how much 5-star reviewers love the Indian Ocean: Thank you for reading.

The beta version of the YouTube Go app is available on the Google Play Store in India. It offers data saving features like the ability to preview videos before the user saves and watches, and a choice of resolutions when saving or streaming videos. YouTube has also tried to emphasize the social aspect of the app by letting users share video with others. The low-bandwidth version app of YouTube has seen many avatars, including YouTube Offline, launched by Google in 2014, which let users download and watch video offline. A variant, Smart Offline, was launched in June with a feature that allowed scheduled saving of videos during times when data is cheaper, such as at nights. The product is far from complete. “While the app is in its beta release, we’ll continue to listen to your feedback and improve the app before launching more broadly,” wrote Jay Akkad, product manager at YouTube, in a blog post. The app was launched in a limited beta covering some 60,000 users in February, a Google spokesman said. Google announced in September low-bandwidth versions of some of its popular products like Chrome. Some of the technologies that Google has developed for India have found use in other markets. Its offline version of Maps, called Maps Offline, which lets users download a map to their phone to navigate around town without a data connection, is in use in some areas of the U.S. and Europe where data connections are patchy. India with a large population of over 1.3 billion has emerged as a key target for a number of technology companies including Google, Microsoft, Facebook and Apple. The aggressive debut of deep-pocketed operator Reliance Jio, which offered free 4G services for about six months, has also also helped push data costs down across the board. WhatsApp may be introducing a person-to-person payment service in India in the next six months, according to news site The Ken. Some evidence of this move comes from a job posting on the WhatsApp website for a Digital Transactions Lead, India, who is expected to be familiar with payment systems and interfaces introduced recently by the Indian government. WhatsApp said India is an important country for it, “and we're understanding how we can contribute more to the vision of Digital India,” but it didn’t confirm the report about launching the payment system in India. ​CIO Executive Council member profile: Emmanuel Steve Dulvin More from CIO Executive Council Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

An Israeli security researcher takes a good look at Samsung's Tizen, labels it the worst code he has ever seen Jordan Palmer Follow View All Posts 2017/04/04 11:26am PDTApr 4, 2017 64 Plus 1 on G+ 276 Share on Facebook 74 Share on Twitter Total Shares414 News Samsung Android is a hulking beast as far as global user share is concerned — hell, it's the most-used operating system in the world, surpassing even Windows (in terms of internet usage). When Samsung announced that it was creating its own open-source alternative to Google's mobile OS, it was not really a surprise. We've had several upstarts over the years, like Sailfish, Firefox OS, Ubuntu Touch, and so on, but all of them have failed in some form or another. There were a few people, however, who thought Sammy could be the one to unseat Google and Android with a mobile operating system that it called Tizen. Whether it's pronounced TEE-zen or TIE-zen is still a mystery (Wikipedia and I say it's the latter), but up until now, word on the integrity and security of the code has been relatively scant. Israeli researcher Amihai Neiderman finally dove into Tizen's guts to see what he could find. According to his report to Motherboard, what he found wasn't good. Niederman claims that the operating system contains what "may be the worst code [he's] ever seen" with signs of amateur mistakes/practices and no less than 40 zero-day vulnerabilities. All of those 40 allow for remote-code execution, which permits nefarious parties to access and assume varying levels of control of a Tizen device. Remember, there are quite a few devices running Samsung's OS, including the Gear smartwatches and some phones. One of the most critical vulnerabilities was in the Tizen Store (the equivalent of the Play Store or App Store), which allowed Niederman to inject malicious code into his Samsung TV (also running Tizen). His conclusion from this was that you as a hypothetical third-party could "update a Tizen system with any malicious code you want." Even the store's authentication measures weren't enough — he just used a heap-overflow vulnerability (which he also discovered) to hijack the software before the security protocols activated. Moving on, Niederman says that Tizen's code base is quite outdated and even borrows some elements from Bada, its predecessor. However, he claims that most of the issues he found were in the new code, which was written in the last two years or so. Some of the mistakes are those one might find programmers making twenty years ago. As Motherboard puts it, this shows that Sammy lacks any basic code development or review practices. To prove his point, Niederman points to one example that he claims was everywhere in Tizen, strcpy(). Basically, strcpy() is a flawed function that is easily exploitable and is not used anymore because of that, yet it is supposedly prevalent in Tizen. To top everything off, Niederman says that the programmers failed to use SSL encryption in certain areas during specific data transmissions. This led him to conclude that they made the wrong assumptions on what needed to be encrypted and purposefully left out SSL in those places. When he initially reached out to Samsung to declare his findings, he was greeted with an automated response. Motherboard's attempts to contact the Korean conglomerate resulted only in the basic PR drivel about the company's focus on security and whatnot. However, after the original article got published, Sammy reached out again to Motherboard to claim that it was working with Niederman to resolve the issues, who corroborated this by saying he was in talks with the corporation. You can read more at the source link below if you're interested. Honestly, I can't say that I'm too surprised. As Mr. Niederman puts it, Samsung should reconsider deploying Tizen to its appliances and future phones before doing a serious overhaul on the code. I find that I agree with him.

(Sarcasm) JohnyNoLegs Lazy coding by coders....SHOCKER!!!! (Sarcasm because even google/apple has shitty code haha) F4LL0U7 But by all means, let's spend $900 on the new Galaxy phone, because I'm sure it's both immune to their terrible code, and totally worth the price tag. Ome Dries The S8 doesn't use Tizen though, so your phone should be safe... your Samsung powered fridge is a different story Leonardo Baez Or their line of smartwatch John Doe Yeah but they probably use the same programmers for Tizen and Android. kalehv I wouldn't think so. Tizen and Android are very very different inside out. demarcmj Probably not the same programmers, but the culture, processes, etc. are probably the same. Just this. the general attitude can't (and won't) be different MJ No... The Android and Tizen programmers are most certainly on different teams and only deal with their platform. This does not mean Samsung as a whole is good at software. John Doe We don't know if they really are on different teams unless Samsung told you. MJ I wouldn't know if Samsung employs cows for programmers unless they told me but I can almost guarantee the teams are separate. Programming teams at any company tend to specialize on ONE project at a time. It's not the same guys... There will be a small number of top programmers who will move from team to to team to fix problems or help with deadlines. John Doe "I can almost guarantee the teams are separate" No you can't unless you are an employee there and know what Samsung is doing. Samsung is not your typical silicon valley tech company so I have no idea how they work. MJ It's funny your whole argument is there is no way we can know how they do it at Samsung yet you had no problem making the statement the Android and Tizen programmers are probably the same which would be a totally unusual setup for any company with large programmer teams. Why not just go with they are probably cows which is why their software is so bad. LOL John Doe They probably are cows :) F4LL0U7 Right, but my point is that their code is crap, and they're making tons of "enhancements" to the Android OS, plus the dozens of Google apps they unnecessarily duplicate. Their terrible code makes a huge impact on the Android ecosystem. tim242 They don't unnecessarily duplicate anything. Samsung has many apps that are far superior to Google's bloatware. John Doe https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e46717cc007988df31954f458f30b8b237b2c4e803101752d08debfaa155bcf3.gif tim242 Samsung Pay>Android Pay Samsung Browser>Chrome John Doe Samsung pay is greater how exactly? And no on the browser I used Samsung's browser it is not as good as chrome. tim242 Ummm I can use Samsung Pay everywhere. As for the browser, you are full of shit. John Doe Umm that is hardware not software, Samsung bought looppay to do that and it has nothing to do with Samsung's software. Chrome is the most used browser in the world...facts. tim242 It is hardware and software, you know like Android Pay uses NFC. You aren't very smart. As for the browser, since when does most used equal best? McDonald's burgers are the most popular burgers, but nobody will claim them to be the best. Do better. John Doe Wow lmao. Looppay uses MST like your credit card so very little software is needed for it to work. You just need to store credit card information. with NFC there is more communications on both ends and more authentication is required. It is more secure than Magnetic strips. But at the end of the day when it comes to software Apple pay and Android Pay are much better (Design, speed, ease of use, etc) I have used Samsung's browser it is featureless. Chrome has a lot of features that I use and it is fast. I save my passwords in chrome, I have data saver, Read later, cached pages for quick reload, Google AMP, autofill is synced, better privacy controls and Do Not Track, Google translate embedded, and fine grain controls for sites accessing camera, microphone, notifications, etc. Samsung's browser is small potatoes compared to Chrome. AbbyZFresh If you've used Samsung's browser, then you would know it's speed >>>>> Chrome is well worth less features in the way John Doe Bitch please you are a bigger troll than Tim and you are a Google hater. Why are you even here? tim242 Your ignorance/stupidity is really showing. MST uses tokenization just the same as NFC. You should educate yourself before commenting about something you know nothing about. Samsung Pay is superior, deal with it. Samsung's browser is lighter, and has more features. You can log into sites with your fingerprint. Try that in Chrome. You can also use an ad blocker plugin. Try that in Chrome. Oh, and it is Chromium based. That means it has a lot of Chrome features as well. Do better John Doe What does tokenization have to do with using the app? We are comparing Samsung Pay with Android pay here and you said samsung pay is better because you can use it anywhere that has nothing to do with samsung pay dumbass that is looppay which samsung bought. It has nothing to do with the actual software. When it comes to the actual app the design, speed and ease of use of Android and Apple pay is better than samsung pay. Chrome still has a lot more features that the two you mentioned. But I can't change the mind of an ignorant troll. A troll is a troll is a troll. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/70cffa9c6cf517883f23a7ea527e30ffa7ecb7b3f6c82e8599d47b0b1cca584e.gif tim242 LoopPay does not exist. Samsung bought it and incorporated it into Samsung Pay, which makes it better than Android Pay. Tokenization means it is not insecure, as you claimed. You are the obvious troll. You make no sense at all. John Doe Looppay is a hardware feature it has very little to do with the app that is like saying I can use 3.5mm headphones with my music app compared to the iPhone. It is a hardware feature but the app at the end of the day is judged separate from that. You are truly fucken moron and deserve a note 7. tim242 LoopPay was the name of a company that no longer exists. MST was bought by Samsung and is part of Samsung Pay. Hardware can't work without software. Why you are trying to separate the two, is beyond me. Take the tech that Google bought from SoftCard/ISIS out of Android Pay, and see how far that NFC chip gets you. You are now on block, as your stupidity is too much for me. John Doe Samsung bought looppay and its patents so you can't have MST on other devices. We are comparing Samsung with Google here so you have to compare only the software not the harware (This whole fucken article is about software and samsung's incompetence). You are fucken retarted Softcard/ISIS was bought for Google wallet not Android pay and it was because carriers blocked Google wallet so Google bought softcard which was made by the carriers. Samsung pay sucks, period. "Samsung Pay's security measures are based on Samsung Knox and ARM TrustZone technologies; credit card information is stored in a secure token.[3] Payments must be authenticated using a fingerprint scan.[6][7] In August 2016, security researcher Salvador Mendoza disclosed a potential flaw with Samsung Pay, arguing that its security tokens were not sufficiently randomized and could become predictable. He also designed a handheld device that could be used to skim magnetic secure transmission tokens, and another which could spoof magnetic stripes on actual card readers using the token. Samsung responded to the report, stating that "If at any time there is a potential vulnerability, we will act promptly to investigate and resolve the issue".[8]" http://www.zdnet.com/article/flaw-in-samsung-pay-lets-hackers-wirelessly-skim-credit-cards/ Middlefinger Just because people are forced to use chrome on Android it doesnt mean its the best. Its the new IE, its terrible on mobile and hardly better on desktop. MJ Who are these people who are forced to use Chrome on Android? John Doe They are not forced to use it. Chrome doesn't come preloaded on desktop but it is still the number one because people go and download it. And it doesn't come preloaded on all Android phones. Middlefinger Yes, it is on every Android phone. If people chose Chrome over Firefox then thats their own problem and its not like FF is perfect either. John Doe It is not on every Android phone. And they choose it because they like it and want to use it. Middlefinger Its compulsory according to the Android licensing agreement, if you want Google play access. John Doe The play store is not on every Android phone...its not on any phone in china for example and the Mobile Application Distribution Agreement is optional and Google chrome is not even set to default and is hidden in a folder on Samsung devices so no one is forcing anyone to do anything here. Middlefinger Its on every phone that has access to the play store. What china does is not relevant to this so dont deflect. You know full well what i was referring to, not that it will stop you claiming victory as is usual on here. Its not hidden, its right on the damn home screen on international unlocked OEM devices. John Doe You said "*EVERY* android phone has Google Chrome". There are plenty of Android phones that do not sign that agreement and do not have the play store on them also the agreement is negotiated with Google including what apps to include. This agreement is also signed with carriers so Google, OEMs and the carriers negotiate it. And yes it is hidden in the US carrier version because I had to go through the app list, open the folder, click on it to use it and also have to make it default...it is not set to default. This was on an S7 edge. https://landing.google.com/intl/en/androidisforusers/faq.html https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-4a46Ko8RE Middlefinger Newsflash, the world doesnt revolve around US carriers.. On the first point.. well done, you won on a technicality that neither of us were even talking about anyway. John Doe That is where OEMs sell the majority of their phones through carriers and specifically US carriers not international unlocked phones which samsung doesn't even update on time (But that is another issue). But even in the international unlocked phone I am sure the S7 also does not have chrome as the default browser. Middlefinger My Samsung devices do, as did my LGs, HTCs and so on (including network branded ones). Some US carriers may have other things installed and set to default, but its the exception in the world. Either way Google requires its bloat be installed, and i dont see that as any better than Samsungs. John Doe You may think is bloat but the billions of Google users out there do not think so go download what you like. Shame-sung C.E.O Swinesung Pay is Garbage. Don't fall for this guys Sheep Mentallity. This is the same person who said CURRENT-C was going to be the winner out of Payment wars LOL!! No joke he was the biggest shill for Months. Shame-sung C.E.O https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d20aef0fbc504aadabb8bd8fde48166d56c8b76806fd4b9f3e699fb0f3c88c9a.jpg https://media.giphy.com/media/l3E6uhDAN3W7vylji/giphy.gif LMFAO!!! LineOS for exynos! I know Samsung browser is based on chromium... But he say 'better' becouse ad blocker... If chrome have ad blocker is will be faster.. that for sure Suicide_Note Two hardly qualifies as 'many apps'. tim242 That was just two examples. Another example is Messages. I have to use Samsung Messages, because Google forces pop up messages, unless you silence them altogether. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages all the time, but I'm not aware of any pop-up messages. Or are you referring to the way the message notification pops up? tim242 Yes, the notifications. Google took the option out of the settings to disable that nonsense. Samsung put the option into their app. Why is Google forcing that on us? It is annoying to have them interrupt what I am doing, and disregards privacy Suicide_Note I like it since i can see if i need to reply immediately or not, or just dismiss it to the notification tray, but to each their own. Good thing we have so many options to choose from. 😊 tim242 Yeah, I would use Google Messenger, if only I could disable that. Knowing Google, they may add that back later. JohnyNoLegs Google doesn't even have an audio recording app LOL. Google has barely anything. Literally BARE Middlefinger amung browser is superior to chrome. A carrier Pigeon is better than chrome, at least Samsung internet actually exits properly when you press the back button. John Doe So go use a carrier pigeon...troll LoL If you like Samsung and their programming skills go buy a Tizen phone Middlefinger I prefer Samsung to Google anyway. Android is a damn mess and getting worse again. Sure 7 is better than the total disaster that was kitkat, but its worse than anything since KK. John Doe Ok so go get a Tizen phone http://www.samsung.com/in/smartphones/samsung-z3/ Middlefinger I prefer Samsungs mods to Android to Googles 'stock', Samsung actually seem to test it before breaking everyone devices. John Doe That is because everyone's device is already broken (Laggy, buggy, slow, and filled with unnecessary apps). Middlefinger Like most of the Google apps, yeah you're right. John Doe Google's apps are updated continually and are stable than the majority of OEM apps since they are mostly updated by OTA instead of through the play store like all of Google's apps. Anyways, that doesn't change the fact that Samsung's software is laggy and terrible...it also gets worse over time which is just sad. And the fact that they take forever to update their phones does not help your argument. Middlefinger Firstly thats horseshit, Google apps are just as unstable as any. Secondly Samsungs launcher can be laggy, jsut like Googles can be painfully limited, so dont use either. The rest of the Samsung mods are better than Googles, especially the notification pulldown. Ive already addressed the update thing. If Google was pushing 7.1.1 to every device in the world there would be hundreds of millions that randomly rebooted. The OEMs test better and it takes time. Older thats stable and fixed is better than newer and broken. John Doe Firstly thats horseshit, Google apps are just as unstable as any. I use Google's apps daily and they are not unstable actually they are highly rated in the play store compared to samsung's apps and are used by way more people that just shows how stable they are. Unless you are using beta version, heck even the beta version is stable so I have no idea what you are talking about. There are always problems with updates even Apple has them with iOS but the difference is Google can push out a fix quickly like Apple. Also with new updates you get security patches and fixes for older bugs that take months to fix when going through OEMs and carriers. If you think Samsung's programming is good go check the article you are commenting on LoL. Middlefinger So what if google can and does patch things quickly, it shouldn't get broken in the first place. This just doesn't happen with most OEM devices, and hasnt to a single one ive ever had. My Nexus devices have been a string of bad hardware, poor software, show stopping faults and RMAs. John Doe I have had several nexus devices and pixel and I have never had severe problems to a point where I had to send it in. There are bugs like any other OEM especially samsung but Google has the ability to fix them quickly. Newflash, it does happen with a lot of OEMs including Apple. This isn't new anyways Google's software is highly praised on the pixel compared to Samsung's "horseshit". Go check the reviews. Middlefinger Im sure the 9 people that have a Pixel just loved the reboots. Nice its fixed, shame it ever happened. Never had severe problem eh? Ive never had ANY with anything except the Nexus'. Highly praised is it? By who exactly? If its the same people that bought the Nexus then they are easily pleased and highly biased. You cant deny there is an entire body of fanboys out there that love AOSP, regardless of how bad it is. If google just secretly used all Samsungs code for 8 it would be the best thing ever, because bias blinds. John Doe 9 people? classy. Nice joke. Never had severe problem eh? Ive never had ANY with anything except the Nexus'. You just lost all credibility just stop. All the tech blogs gave it excellent reviews and said it was the best Android phone available even tech blogs that favor Apple said so and that says a lot. Middlefinger Yeah, OK. Zero Mizukami What didnt you like about kitkat? I was always under the impression kitkat was more or less the pinnacle of Android Audio Totally disagree. There are no Samsung apps on my S7 that I actually use. tim242 That's you. I use Samsung Pay every day, to pay for everything. Samsung's browser is far superior to Chrome. I use Samsung's SMS app, because Google forces pop up messages on theirs. F4LL0U7 That's your opinion, and of course I have my own. It was just a little frustrating when I started my work GS7 for the first time and saw two of nearly every app. As a Nexus/Pixel guy, I'm horrified at Samsung's terrible (in my opinion) design and functionality standards. Not to mention the 3rd party garbage they toss in there too. I had to purchase an app that allows me to disable their default apps. When your first task in the process of setting up a new phone is to wade through and remove the bloat, there's something wrong there. tim242 I purchased a package disabler as well. But I also had to disable a lot of Google bloatware as well. John Doe You need to look up the term bloatware. Lookup, Microsoft office, facebook, and all the other unnecessary apps that don't need to be preinstalled are bloatware. Anyways I don't know what I am arguing with you samsung phones are burning up...literally so unless samsung sells 100+ million s8 they will always be behind apple. tim242 Behind apple haha you are silly. John Doe Why is that silly? They are behind Apple in the smartphone business. tim242 That is not true. Get educated, then comment. John Doe Lmao http://www.techtimes.com/articles/188124/20161208/apple-iphone-7-is-the-best-selling-smartphone-in-us-trumping-the-samsung-galaxy-s7-kantar.htm https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/56f89a4335e2c7fe807cdebf208e142c62b61a5cec127b30c1f4b3c96aee3961.gif tim242 Lmao that is just the S7. Samsung has many other smartphones. You are trying to move the goalposts. Try harder John Doe http://bgr.com/2017/02/03/apple-vs-samsung-sales-2016/ http://www.businessinsider.com/samsung-galaxy-apple-iphone-premium-market-share-chart-2016-12 https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/10/16/samsung-galaxy-vs-iphone-which-product-line-has-so.aspx Apple beat Samsung with 3 Phones....Samsung had 31. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/13806899d2dd953b00745e25586ce63bc99bfb72ae0d42ccd3bbb42fa9c618b5.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78dd8b407e1ea19bc331dea202aae34c0cb0772bea409ff56a11d2efb86e7f9d.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/91444a76a0ec89e25770a31b864244d9c04aad4f64e7c6152e993058b5c82bb9.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/688053d5bd7c128160ba9a9dfe79639b542955188e91c63913e08ee14faa1f85.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e9eb24fa3eae7253df33b2eb97d2250c7c498213eec6de868a759657891aad6b.png JohnyNoLegs Yea like Pixel Launcher, Hangouts, Daydream haha byteseyes Google apps are definitely bloatware. There's tons of Google bloatware I delete every time I get a new device with Android on it. Granted, I think Samsung and Google should get a pass for including their software because it's Samsung's hardware and part Samsung and part Google's software. Completely 3rd party companies like carriers or Microsoft stuffing their software is the worst kind of bloatware. John Doe Google apps are not bloatware because people do use them and they are useful. Bloatware means apps that people don't use and waste space on your device. Google's apps definitly do not waste space and the majority of them are used so no they are not bloatware. These are the apps Google requires most are Google play apps: Google Chrome Google Maps Google Drive YouTube Gmail Google+ (The only one I think is unnecessary) Google Play Music Google Play Movies Google Play Books Google Play Newsstand Google Play Games Google Photos Hangouts (Probably stopped requiring it already) byteseyes Your conclusion that Google apps are not bloatware rests on the premise that people use them. By the same token, Samsung apps are not bloatware because people do use them and they are useful. Realistically, I can count on 2 hands the number of people I've come across who use Google Play Music, Movies, Books, Newsstand, Games, Photos, Hangouts, and Google+. Most people I know do use YouTube and Maps the most, while Chrome is forced onto people often. Drive is a wash. That means almost all of Google's apps are not commonly used, hence waste space. So don't you think it's unfair and untrue to make the assumption that people use Google apps, while simultaneously making the unfair and untrue assumption that people don't use Samsung apps? I personally love Samsung apps and I find most of Google's apps redundant. I can understand if people are vice versa. Haha, sorry, I didn't mean this response to be too long, so all boiled down, Samsung and Google apps are either both bloatware or both not. Hope you can understand that they can not be different. John Doe Fact is that far more people use Google's apps than Samsung's you can check the play store reviews and how many people use them. Google's services are used way more often than Samsung's that is a known fact. Google and Samsung do not release numbers of every single app but Google has a billion+ monthly active users on some of their services. When it comes to the Google play apps, they come in a package with the play store. It makes no fucken sense to have a music section in the play store and no app to play it with. They are a package. Chrome is not "forced" on people. You need to lookup what that word means and Chrome is not even set as default on samsung devices so how the hell is it "forced"? That means almost all of Google's apps are not commonly used, hence waste space. It is silly to make a statement like that So don't you think it's unfair and untrue to make the assumption that people use Google apps, while simultaneously making the unfair and untrue assumption that people don't use Samsung apps? No because like stated above Google has more than billion+ active users on their services and highly rated apps in the play store and they a regularly updated. Samsung on the other hand has even discontinued multiple apps and services because no one is using them like Samsung milk music. https://play.google.com/store/apps/collection/search_results_cluster_apps?clp=ggEJCgdzYW1zdW5n:S:ANO1ljLMiXA https://play.google.com/store/apps/collection/search_results_cluster_apps?clp=ggEICgZnb29nbGU%3D:S:ANO1ljIY5oM Bloatware apps are determined by the user and I am positive that more users find Google's apps in a favorable light than Samsung's. You are in the minority. byteseyes "Fact is that far more people use Google's apps than Samsung's you can check the play store reviews and how many people use them. Google's services are used way more often than Samsung's that is a known fact. Google and Samsung do not release numbers of every single app but Google has a billion+ monthly active users on some of their services." YouTube and Maps are the most popular. The majority of Google apps are not used at all by most people. But that doesn't matter. The point is lots of people use Google apps, and lots of people use Samsung apps too. You can't ignore one group of people even if it's one order of magnitude smaller. It's still a significant number. "When it comes to the Google play apps, they come in a package with the play store. It makes no fucken sense to have a music section in the play store and no app to play it with. They are a package." Many people don't use them. I'm just using your own assumption and logic. I personally deleted them. Whether it makes sense or not to include them is irrelevant. Of course from a company's perspective it almost always makes sense to include their own service. That's business. You're inclined to make justifications for Google but not for others. "Chrome is not "forced" on people. You need to lookup what that word means and Chrome is not even set as default on samsung devices so how the hell is it "forced"?" It's not forced on Samsung devices thank god. But anyway, instead of on smartphones, I was just remembering off the top of my head about the Chrome browser slipping its way into many people's computers, so I was going off a tangent there. "It is silly to make a statement like that" It's pure logic. "No because like stated above Google has more than billion+ active users on their services and highly rated apps in the play store and they a regularly updated. Samsung on the other hand has even discontinued multiple apps and services because no one is using them like Samsung milk music." Again, that's not the case for almost all of Google's apps. Most of Google's apps are not commonly used. Google also discontinues or leaves as zombies apps that no one uses. "Bloatware apps are determined by the user" That's what I've been saying all along. "and I am positive that more users find Google's apps in a favorable light than Samsung's. You are in the minority." Of course a software-centric company is going to have a larger user base. I may be in the minority, but it's still a large number of people. We're not talking about 1 user vs 1 million. If there's 1 user, and an app is installed to cater to that one 1 user, then it would be bad to include the app. But many, many, many people use Samsung apps too. You can't cherry pick what you like and ignore everything that others like. John Doe Exactly so going back to my original comment that Google's apps are not bloatware and that apps from Facebook, Microsoft, and Lookout are bloatware. Also when Samsung has two music apps like Google play music and Milk on their devices and they end up discontinuing Milk because no one uses it that is also bloatware. So I am glad we cleared up your confusion on whether Google's apps are "definitly bloatware" https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/04d006e4bd2b9525b0b0e9550444617ee69614c33bf605ad372243dc9af02410.png byteseyes Logic must not be your strong suit. John Doe Good Job nice comeback byteseyes Thanks. byteseyes I can understand your viewpoint. Me personally, I find most of Google's apps redundant because I really love Samsung's apps. I actually did the same as you haha! I purchased an app to delete all of Google's apps except Youtube and Maps and a few of Samsung's too. I think there are people who use Samsung apps and people who use Google apps. Not referring to you, but some people like to think Google apps are not bloatware because they themselves use them. But many people also love and use Samsung apps, myself included. Even though I love Samsung apps, I can totally understand if people are vice versa. Logically speaking, either both Samsung and Google apps are both bloatware or both not. dabug91 Lol, umm Samsung has it's own calendar app, calculator app, memo app, messaging app, etc and they're all shit. No phone has more bloatware than a Samsung phone. They win hands-down in that category. tim242 I prefer all of those to Google's offerings. I'm glad to have a choice. OligarchyAmbulance You honestly think they have higher standards for their lagfest Android skin? tim242 They have higher standards than Google/HTC with the dumpster fire that is Pixel. John Doe https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a1405ef722a16da1e676294296d43a0d524eaaf5c53be0f4ec6d89b9ab035eb1.gif M. Luciano What? Where are you getting all this? tim242 There have been numerous hardware issues reported since release. Some of which being the microphone, speakers, camera, and the display. tekfr33kn I've had my Pixel for a few months now and haven't had a single one of those problems. I know that a few people have had them but it's more rare than you you are making it out to be. Audio Or for Knox for that matter! Bob http://imgur.com/gallery/UrhOtai Middlefinger No it uses Android, which we all know is perfect/ s ... At least Samsung fixes the mess Google creates most of time though. Jumanji! Are you perhaps conflating user experience with quality/security of code? A company can make something look pretty or function, but that doesn't mean there aren't any issues with the security of their code. Computer science isn't an exact science and creating software is always a series of trade offs. Middlefinger No im basing it on all the problem Google has with its own devices and how much time OEMs have to spend fixing Google code before they release it on their own devices. Jumanji! What do you expect? Android is a big, complex platform and there are a number of OEMs who blend it with their own, unique hardware variations and services. It's absolutely normal for customers to find defects in shipping products. It's ultimately how the company reacts to customer facing defects and issues that really matters. I'd love to see a list of the volume of defects that OEMs have fixed in the Android platform. I think data has the potential of strengthening your arguments rather than having them appear to be nothing but hyperbole. Middlefinger Not all fixes they make is committed back to stock. Much of what the OEMs do is proprietary, but given that OEM devices dont have the problems AOSP based devices do its reasonable to say they fixed something. If all the Google devices had identical hardware you could argue the problem is which specific hardware, but thats not the case. Regardless of the hardware the problem persists because the problems are in Googles code. Zsolt V You are right in everything you wrote. Congrats, finally a sane voice. F4LL0U7 If that was sincere and not sarcastic, thanks! JohnyNoLegs Haha doesn't run Tizen. Fail. Google code their own bugs anyway. F4LL0U7 No shit, try reading the rest of the thread.

I don't recall my Nexus 7 which have had for three years ever randomly rebooting. I used a Nexus 5 actively for 2 1/2 years and remember a short period where I had to MANUALLY reboot it a couple of times a week. My Pixel XL has been stable and just as fast/smooth since day one. JohnyNoLegs Pixel XL here, required one RMA, 3 factory resets. Bluetooth is still dodgy. Google Play music is dodgy, it doesn't play for more than 30 mins without stopping audio. LOL at you thinking Google/Nexus?Pixel is any better LOLOLOLOLOL MJ OK, you had a bad phone. So? I have owned more than three Nexus/Pixel devices with no major issues. Regardless, I was responding specifically to the random rebooting issue the OP mentioned that I have never seen. JohnyNoLegs Nexus 5X random reboots. My wife RMA'd it within the first 6 months. 6P battery would die when it got to 30%, RMA'd that and the 6P i got, android system used loads of battery and I would barely get 1.5 hrs SOT even after factory resets. Then bought Note7, was leaps and bounds ahead of the Nexus 5X and 6P, except for the whole risk of exploding....THen I got the Pixel, which yea sure it's always fast at first, but it does so much less than the Note 7, and now my Pixel struggles at points anyway. I have owned every nexus except for the 6, I have also owned nearly all LG G series and Galaxy series. The most Issues I have had are with nexus devices, mostly to do with updates. Airoid Sammy is fu#ked Suicide_Note Hardly.

Carson Saldanha He's a wizard bruh Carson Saldanha Yes, that is "Smart Lock" and if I'm not mistaken, I think Google even put a warning of this. They also didn't advertise this as a "feature". Abhilash Bingi TBF Google also introduced the Face Unlock feature back in 2011 (with ICS and the Galaxy Nexus) which could be fooled by a photo. But it warned you that it's not completely safe and can be fooled by a photo when you tried to activate it. Joannaescott Google is paying $97 per hour! Work for few hours & have longer with friends and family! !ft187c: On monday I got a great new mclaren f1 from having earned $12778 this last four weeks.. 3 to 5 hours of work a day...

Google likes to whip things up quick and throw spaghetti on the wall to see what sticks. There's lots of mistakes in that process. Also, Samsung specifically stated face unlock is not intended to be a secure locking method. They specifically said it's analogous to slide to unlock, so I don't understand why people are misunderstanding this as a "security flaw" when it's not. Justin That's why Google removed Face Unlock in Lollipop. Abhilash Bingi What? No. It just got renamed to 'Trusted face' and moved to Smart Lock along with 'Trusted places' location and 'Trusted Devices'. It's still an option on my Pixel. OligarchyAmbulance Same here. If this is how they treat their own OS, I have no hope for their version of Android. You're lucky if you even get a security patch from them. byteseyes Samsung's the only company out of all manufacturers that releases monthly security patches actually. Pretty awesome. OligarchyAmbulance No, Google does too. byteseyes I mentioned out of all manufacturers. Google's not a manufacturer. That's why I was pointing out that it makes Samsung special. OligarchyAmbulance The Pixel, Pixel C, Chromebook Pixel, Home, Chromecast, Chromecast Audio, Google WiFi, and Daydream would disagree with you. byteseyes Um, I thought it was quite obvious we're talking about phones, given that we're discussing Android and monthly security patches on smartphones. What does a laptop or a router have anything to do with smartphones? Besides, the Pixel phone was not manufactured by Google. Regardless, this doesn't change my original statement that Samsung is the only manufacturer that releases monthly security patches (for their smartphones, in case I wasn't explicit enough), and nobody considers Google a manufacturer, even with Google's nascent foray into the fringe hardware products you listed. In time, Google may become a manufacturer too. Who knows. OligarchyAmbulance "Google's not a manufacturer." "Um, I thought it was quite obvious we're talking about phones" Google is a manufacturer of many devices. That was the point. "Besides, the Pixel phone was not manufactured by Google" Right, and iPhones are made by Foxconn. So technically speaking, Apple has never updated an Apple device. byteseyes Um, you do realize you're arguing about absolutely nothing right now? I never denied Google updates their phone. I already knew Google updates their phone. I was stating that Samsung, a phone manufacturer, is the only OEM that releases monthly security patches, a direct contradiction to your initial statement "You're lucky if you even get a security patch from them." OligarchyAmbulance "Samsung, a phone manufacturer, is the only OEM that releases monthly security patches" They're the only OEM if you don't include another OEM. lol byteseyes Google's an OEM? Apple's OEM? That's news to everyone. tim242 Android's face unlock was the same. Besides, Samsung tells you that it is low security. You are just a nasty google sheep. EcE While I don't disagree, it's been 5 or 6 years. If Samsung was going to implement it, at least try harder. My guess is that it was a last minute addition due to the rumored onscreen fingerprint sensor they had to ditch. Shame-sung C.E.O Says the Current-C Shill who is a sheep to Swinesung now. Carson Saldanha Have I ever agreed on anything with you? tim242 I am not sure. But you should more often : ) Carson Saldanha -___________________________________________- Shame-sung C.E.O This has nothing to do with Apple. SWINESUNG is a huge dishonest,Corrupt,Horrible company who will be always known for stealing , profit, sued, settle. Speculation on what Apple is going to do = Nothing. The sad Truth is that Pathetic TIZEN Garbage OS will always be a Rip off iOS,Android & Windows and WebOS . Swinesung does nothing Original and does it half baked like all its product. FAIL FAIL FAIL. Peter World Citizen Your Korean boyfriend left you recently? ;) Shame-sung C.E.O why are you sharing what your mother told you? Kind of random LOL!! Defenestratus Google's software development isn't by any means stellar either. John Doe It is definitly more secure than Samsung and better designed. Google has a project zero team so find security flaws and it works great...I wonder why they haven't looked at Tizen OS lmao Zsolt V It's by not stellar you mean that it's the best out of all commercial companies you are right.... QwertyJuan To be fair... if you lose your phone, there is a HIGH chance that the person finding it has NO idea who you are, doesn't possess any pictures of you, thereby making the facial recognition feature a decent level of security. No... it won't stop your younger brother or one of your friends from "hacking" your phone when you are asleep. :) P.S. Samsung ALSO has a retina scanner built into the phone which is actually MORE secure than even a fingerprint scanner and for some reason we hear NOTHING about this feature. whispy_snippet It's less secure for the very reasons you just outlined. It's easier to get a photo of someone than their fingerprint. Drakenoid Not if you're a common thief, then it's easier to get their fingerprints off the phone than their pic. whispy_snippet I'm sceptical that a common thief has the tools and/or technical know-how to obtain and then exploit someone's finger print. It's not easy. Drakenoid True, but it's then also unlikely for them to get photo of the owner. My name is…. Oh yes, the classic douche that says "that's why i stick with Pixel/Nexus devices" Because Android was never full of holes or the Pixel deserves the iphone-like price tag. Zsolt V It's better than an iPhone, so why shouldn't it be priced so? Justin You know what's worse than GoPro Sheeps? Nexus Sheeps. YaKillaCJ Hold up now, while I agree that Samsung suck in the software department, I disagree with the Chinese OEM part. Let's not forget that Xiaomi has the best update record, even surpassing Google depending how ya look at it. Also OnePlus has been really good and ZTE not bad at all. Zsolt V What does update speed have anything to do with this topic? jodieisme Security patch..? Zsolt V So Samsung doesn't deliver timely monthly patches? mma173 Xiaomi is a way better than Google. MIUI has so many advantages over the other Android roms. But the one has to admit that they took their "inspiration" from Apple :) especially in the early days. Drakenoid True, I wish they would update the basic usability of MIUI to be more in line with Android, specially now that Android does a lot of things better. They don't have to serve Google's Android just an updated version with better design. I love their features though. Though Xiaomi doesn't provide security patches to Mi 5 as fast as they should. Zsolt V So you 3D print a face, no difference. Adam Truelove Agree, Stock Android managed by Google running on an S8 would be wonderful. Samsung makes great hardware, but absolute garbage software. JohnyNoLegs Samsung states it isn't secure man. SAM I had read about Tizen code and management and no wonder this article makes sense. Read what other programmers had to say abt tizen https://what.thedailywtf.com/topic/15687/code-review-malediction https://what.thedailywtf.com/topic/15001/enlightened Suicide_Note I view Tizen as being akin to the dark language of Mordor, and should never be spoken of. marcusmarcus2 What? Now you just made Tizen sound kinda cool. Jordan Palmer Well done. Bewear Die, T(ouchW)izen, die. YouNex That's why #NeverSamsung JohnyNoLegs Yea, go with some other small company that must have great developers and code review policies...LOL Audio This has always been my fear about tizen and why I can't buy the gear s3 watch, ESPECIALLY for using Samsung Pay. It also makes me wonder about Samsung Knox, tbh... Sruly J Isn't part of Knox incorporated into Android for Work? Audio Is it? I always assumed it was separate... Doesn't Knox pre-date Android for Work? Defenestratus Yes it is integrated into Android's Security apparatus and yes, it pre-dated Android for Work (which as far as I can tell is vaporware). saf1927 Android for Work is useful to use it as way to have multiple app profiles. There's an app on the Play Store that create a work profile you can manage yourself by adding apps, etc. LineOS for exynos! Call island Sruly J Don't remember the article, but this article says that part of Knox was incorporated into Android. http://www.zdnet.com/article/google-samsung-integrate-knox-into-android-eye-enterprise-gains/ Shame-sung C.E.O LMFAO!! For years i been saying the same-thing. TIZEN OS is just pure Trash. Swinesung has always had lower standards then free boostmobile phones and Software that should be on V-Tech phones at the least( no insult to V-tech). How ever we all know Swinesung is not Special and has never been special. It's just a Sheep Mentality. Good thing there is Nexus who gives you Amazing Hardware and Software not Bloatware and Half baked products like the ones Swinesung makes. Another Fail from Swinesung. Aaron Uh, you know Nexus isn't a thing anymore, right? Middlefinger Samsung probably spends so much time fixing Googles mess on Android for its devices that there is no time for Tizen.. tekfr33kn You mean f-ing up Android - Fix'd it for ya. Middlefinger How can they f it up when they make it actually work without causing the phone to reboot randomly. Thats an Android fault that affects a number of totally different devices, its not hardware, its Googles software, again. Googles UX is just getting old now, and while yes, Touchwiz was poor in places Grace UX is far superior to whatever the hell Google is doing. Its more logical, provides more information in a better way and is fully themeable. Adam Margeson Having owned the original Android device (HTC Dream), a Nexus 5 and a Pixel on top of several others, Google's devices tend to be the more stable ones in my experience. It's other OEMs like Sony, HTC and others that tend to have problems because of code they precariously stack on top of Android. I'm not saying that Samsung's is better or worse than others', but Stock Android has been fairly stable for me. As to "Google's UX is getting old now",.. As compared to what? Samsung's is really just a highly integrated theme on top of Google's UX. Sure, the settings are moved around, the quick settings look a little different, etc, but what about General "Android" is getting old? JohnyNoLegs My experience is the opposite. Having had RMA'd my Pixel XL twice, and had to Factory Reset a few more times, that's more than all my phone prior. Given the latest Bluetooth bugs and Google Play Music bugs, I think you are just floating on cloud 9 oblivious to reality. I have come from Samsung, LG and HTC. My Nexus 5x is a whole other story, it has been even worse haha Adam Margeson My normal vehicle doesn't have Bluetooth, but the rentals I used for several weeks during the time (2017 KIA Sonata, 2016 Ford F350 and 2016 Ford Taurus) that the bug was active didn't seem to have any issues - in fact, they were overly aggressive in trying to connect even when I didn't want it to. I also don't generally use Google Play Music. So, no, I haven't been on Cloud Nine, I just haven't had the same issues other people have. That said, I was hit by the audio-clipping-at-loud-volumes bug that was there for a couple months. That was mildly (/s) annoying. I only factory reset my Nexus 5 a handful of times over the 3.5 years that I used it, and that was more a matter of having far too many apps and background services running to the point that I just reset it rather than cleaning it up. I have read AP every day since I found the site back when the Galaxy Nexus was released, and I am well aware of the bugs other people have been having. I count myself lucky that I haven't been seen most of those bugs personally. Middlefinger None of it is 'stacked on top of stock'. Its a replacement for it, the stock code isnt there. Almost all OEM android is virtually a fork, and there is no reason why i cannot be better than Googles version. whispy_snippet This is the guy who labels people "Google shills". Middlefinger Who am I shilling for? Samsung because I have their phone, LG because I have their TV, or Microsoft because i have their Tablet? Maybe im just not happy with the state of Android at the moment.. Nah, i must be a paid Samsung troll obviously. whispy_snippet So? What's your point? I have a Surface, an LG TV and a Pixel. But everyone knows phones are the most important piece of tech a person owns which is why they generate such intense discussion. You seem like a huge Samsung "shill" and a massive hypocrite. Middlefinger Everyone knows that do they? Sure if you say so, maybe if you are 14. Funny ive been accused of being a shill for Google as well, so it seems to to depend on the bias of the accuser, namely, you. whispy_snippet You're kidding. So you disagree that the smartphone is the most important and innovative piece of consumer technology this century? Mate, what planet are you living on? Middlefinger I didnt say it wasnt (it was actually invented last century, but whatever). I said its not the most essential to everyone. whispy_snippet I didn't say it was invented this century, but whatever. The statement "everyone knows" was an unbelievably poor choice of words and I can't believe I actually wrote it. But my broader point that smartphones are the most important piece of consumer technology this century still stands. My other point, that you're a hypocrite, also still stands. whispy_snippet Oh yeah. For sure man. You got it. M. Luciano This makes sense. Samsung doesn't know mobile security. They have Knox, which they purchased and then had fixed by BlackBerry. We have notifications constantly about people's dryers and refrigerators being hacked, their TV's being hacked and the only way they get out of it on Android is because someone else is handling 90%+ of the legwork, ie. Google. JohnyNoLegs Knox is better than AOSP. M. Luciano I don't believe that at all, but even if true, the point was they didn't create that. JohnyNoLegs Why would that matter who created it? keithzg Because it speaks to their ability to write good, secure software, which is what's in question here. JohnyNoLegs Well they didn't write it, so then it should be great then by your logic. You are also ASSUMING, that all dev's/dev teams/products are done by the same people, which would be a huge assumption that is probably very wrong. Samsung didn't even code Tizen anyway. M. Luciano Because if they'd have built it, they'd probably understand something about security. But they bought it and then had BlackBerry improve it. JohnyNoLegs So thats a good thing right? ast00 At the end of the day, it's still Samsung. Not surprised. Rod Samsung and poor software? Not surprised. Marty What else is new? Samsung's not known for quality software. They've gotten better with Touch-Wiz, but that's their pinnacle. Peter World Citizen All compilers should just mark strcpy() as error. ;) bekifft Worse than this, Tizen runs on refrigerators, and all that other "smart" crap. People are connecting this junk to the internet and forgetting about it. This is the kind of stuff that causes problems like Mirai. JohnyNoLegs Linux runs on refrigerators, and all that other smart crap. Are you saying the devs that made all that smart crap did it better? Andy J So..... um...... anyone know what the SmartThings hubs run on then? Are we facing a potential situation where they could be hijacked. D13H4RD2L1V3 Here's something, though. Tizen technically isn't made by Samsung entirely. It's a project within the Linux Foundation and developed and overseen by the Tizen Association. As you'd expect, Samsung is a member, but so are other companies such as Huawei and Intel. Despite that, only Samsung has actually implemented the OS in their products. Given the shocking number of security holes, I can only assume that it was far from ready. Even though Samsung's Android skin is better than previous iterations, I don't particularly hold it in super-high regard because software has never been Samsung's forte. And I think they should make it so soon as their hardware gets better and better. Đức Thành I am not the least bit surprised, but that part about the legacy of Bada OS living on was particularly hilarious. mma173 Software industry especially OSs is a very specialized resource-intensive field. I wish Samsung should give up working on OSs to free up resources. ROB Can he also work on getting Nougat to the unlocked S7s ?

An Israeli security researcher takes a good look at Samsung's Tizen, labels it the worst code he has ever seen Jordan Palmer Follow View All Posts 2017/04/04 11:26am PDTApr 4, 2017 64 Plus 1 on G+ 276 Share on Facebook 74 Share on Twitter Total Shares414 News Samsung Android is a hulking beast as far as global user share is concerned — hell, it's the most-used operating system in the world, surpassing even Windows (in terms of internet usage). When Samsung announced that it was creating its own open-source alternative to Google's mobile OS, it was not really a surprise. We've had several upstarts over the years, like Sailfish, Firefox OS, Ubuntu Touch, and so on, but all of them have failed in some form or another. There were a few people, however, who thought Sammy could be the one to unseat Google and Android with a mobile operating system that it called Tizen. Whether it's pronounced TEE-zen or TIE-zen is still a mystery (Wikipedia and I say it's the latter), but up until now, word on the integrity and security of the code has been relatively scant. Israeli researcher Amihai Neiderman finally dove into Tizen's guts to see what he could find. According to his report to Motherboard, what he found wasn't good. Niederman claims that the operating system contains what "may be the worst code [he's] ever seen" with signs of amateur mistakes/practices and no less than 40 zero-day vulnerabilities. All of those 40 allow for remote-code execution, which permits nefarious parties to access and assume varying levels of control of a Tizen device. Remember, there are quite a few devices running Samsung's OS, including the Gear smartwatches and some phones. One of the most critical vulnerabilities was in the Tizen Store (the equivalent of the Play Store or App Store), which allowed Niederman to inject malicious code into his Samsung TV (also running Tizen). His conclusion from this was that you as a hypothetical third-party could "update a Tizen system with any malicious code you want." Even the store's authentication measures weren't enough — he just used a heap-overflow vulnerability (which he also discovered) to hijack the software before the security protocols activated. Moving on, Niederman says that Tizen's code base is quite outdated and even borrows some elements from Bada, its predecessor. However, he claims that most of the issues he found were in the new code, which was written in the last two years or so. Some of the mistakes are those one might find programmers making twenty years ago. As Motherboard puts it, this shows that Sammy lacks any basic code development or review practices. To prove his point, Niederman points to one example that he claims was everywhere in Tizen, strcpy(). Basically, strcpy() is a flawed function that is easily exploitable and is not used anymore because of that, yet it is supposedly prevalent in Tizen. To top everything off, Niederman says that the programmers failed to use SSL encryption in certain areas during specific data transmissions. This led him to conclude that they made the wrong assumptions on what needed to be encrypted and purposefully left out SSL in those places. When he initially reached out to Samsung to declare his findings, he was greeted with an automated response. Motherboard's attempts to contact the Korean conglomerate resulted only in the basic PR drivel about the company's focus on security and whatnot. However, after the original article got published, Sammy reached out again to Motherboard to claim that it was working with Niederman to resolve the issues, who corroborated this by saying he was in talks with the corporation. You can read more at the source link below if you're interested. Honestly, I can't say that I'm too surprised. As Mr. Niederman puts it, Samsung should reconsider deploying Tizen to its appliances and future phones before doing a serious overhaul on the code. I find that I agree with him.

Ome Dries The S8 doesn't use Tizen though, so your phone should be safe... your Samsung powered fridge is a different story Leonardo Baez Or their line of smartwatch John Doe Yeah but they probably use the same programmers for Tizen and Android. kalehv I wouldn't think so. Tizen and Android are very very different inside out. demarcmj Probably not the same programmers, but the culture, processes, etc. are probably the same. Just this. the general attitude can't (and won't) be different MJ No... The Android and Tizen programmers are most certainly on different teams and only deal with their platform. This does not mean Samsung as a whole is good at software. John Doe We don't know if they really are on different teams unless Samsung told you. MJ I wouldn't know if Samsung employs cows for programmers unless they told me but I can almost guarantee the teams are separate. Programming teams at any company tend to specialize on ONE project at a time. It's not the same guys... There will be a small number of top programmers who will move from team to to team to fix problems or help with deadlines. John Doe "I can almost guarantee the teams are separate" No you can't unless you are an employee there and know what Samsung is doing. Samsung is not your typical silicon valley tech company so I have no idea how they work. MJ It's funny your whole argument is there is no way we can know how they do it at Samsung yet you had no problem making the statement the Android and Tizen programmers are probably the same which would be a totally unusual setup for any company with large programmer teams. Why not just go with they are probably cows which is why their software is so bad. LOL John Doe They probably are cows :) F4LL0U7 Right, but my point is that their code is crap, and they're making tons of "enhancements" to the Android OS, plus the dozens of Google apps they unnecessarily duplicate. Their terrible code makes a huge impact on the Android ecosystem. tim242 They don't unnecessarily duplicate anything. Samsung has many apps that are far superior to Google's bloatware. John Doe https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e46717cc007988df31954f458f30b8b237b2c4e803101752d08debfaa155bcf3.gif tim242 Samsung Pay>Android Pay Samsung Browser>Chrome John Doe Samsung pay is greater how exactly? And no on the browser I used Samsung's browser it is not as good as chrome. tim242 Ummm I can use Samsung Pay everywhere. As for the browser, you are full of shit. John Doe Umm that is hardware not software, Samsung bought looppay to do that and it has nothing to do with Samsung's software. Chrome is the most used browser in the world...facts. tim242 It is hardware and software, you know like Android Pay uses NFC. You aren't very smart. As for the browser, since when does most used equal best? McDonald's burgers are the most popular burgers, but nobody will claim them to be the best. Do better. John Doe Wow lmao. Looppay uses MST like your credit card so very little software is needed for it to work. You just need to store credit card information. with NFC there is more communications on both ends and more authentication is required. It is more secure than Magnetic strips. But at the end of the day when it comes to software Apple pay and Android Pay are much better (Design, speed, ease of use, etc) I have used Samsung's browser it is featureless. Chrome has a lot of features that I use and it is fast. I save my passwords in chrome, I have data saver, Read later, cached pages for quick reload, Google AMP, autofill is synced, better privacy controls and Do Not Track, Google translate embedded, and fine grain controls for sites accessing camera, microphone, notifications, etc. Samsung's browser is small potatoes compared to Chrome. AbbyZFresh If you've used Samsung's browser, then you would know it's speed >>>>> Chrome is well worth less features in the way John Doe Bitch please you are a bigger troll than Tim and you are a Google hater. Why are you even here? tim242 Your ignorance/stupidity is really showing. MST uses tokenization just the same as NFC. You should educate yourself before commenting about something you know nothing about. Samsung Pay is superior, deal with it. Samsung's browser is lighter, and has more features. You can log into sites with your fingerprint. Try that in Chrome. You can also use an ad blocker plugin. Try that in Chrome. Oh, and it is Chromium based. That means it has a lot of Chrome features as well. Do better John Doe What does tokenization have to do with using the app? We are comparing Samsung Pay with Android pay here and you said samsung pay is better because you can use it anywhere that has nothing to do with samsung pay dumbass that is looppay which samsung bought. It has nothing to do with the actual software. When it comes to the actual app the design, speed and ease of use of Android and Apple pay is better than samsung pay. Chrome still has a lot more features that the two you mentioned. But I can't change the mind of an ignorant troll. A troll is a troll is a troll. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/70cffa9c6cf517883f23a7ea527e30ffa7ecb7b3f6c82e8599d47b0b1cca584e.gif tim242 LoopPay does not exist. Samsung bought it and incorporated it into Samsung Pay, which makes it better than Android Pay. Tokenization means it is not insecure, as you claimed. You are the obvious troll. You make no sense at all. John Doe Looppay is a hardware feature it has very little to do with the app that is like saying I can use 3.5mm headphones with my music app compared to the iPhone. It is a hardware feature but the app at the end of the day is judged separate from that. You are truly fucken moron and deserve a note 7. tim242 LoopPay was the name of a company that no longer exists. MST was bought by Samsung and is part of Samsung Pay. Hardware can't work without software. Why you are trying to separate the two, is beyond me. Take the tech that Google bought from SoftCard/ISIS out of Android Pay, and see how far that NFC chip gets you. You are now on block, as your stupidity is too much for me. John Doe Samsung bought looppay and its patents so you can't have MST on other devices. We are comparing Samsung with Google here so you have to compare only the software not the harware (This whole fucken article is about software and samsung's incompetence). You are fucken retarted Softcard/ISIS was bought for Google wallet not Android pay and it was because carriers blocked Google wallet so Google bought softcard which was made by the carriers. Samsung pay sucks, period. "Samsung Pay's security measures are based on Samsung Knox and ARM TrustZone technologies; credit card information is stored in a secure token.[3] Payments must be authenticated using a fingerprint scan.[6][7] In August 2016, security researcher Salvador Mendoza disclosed a potential flaw with Samsung Pay, arguing that its security tokens were not sufficiently randomized and could become predictable. He also designed a handheld device that could be used to skim magnetic secure transmission tokens, and another which could spoof magnetic stripes on actual card readers using the token. Samsung responded to the report, stating that "If at any time there is a potential vulnerability, we will act promptly to investigate and resolve the issue".[8]" http://www.zdnet.com/article/flaw-in-samsung-pay-lets-hackers-wirelessly-skim-credit-cards/ Middlefinger Just because people are forced to use chrome on Android it doesnt mean its the best. Its the new IE, its terrible on mobile and hardly better on desktop. MJ Who are these people who are forced to use Chrome on Android? John Doe They are not forced to use it. Chrome doesn't come preloaded on desktop but it is still the number one because people go and download it. And it doesn't come preloaded on all Android phones. Middlefinger Yes, it is on every Android phone. If people chose Chrome over Firefox then thats their own problem and its not like FF is perfect either. John Doe It is not on every Android phone. And they choose it because they like it and want to use it. Middlefinger Its compulsory according to the Android licensing agreement, if you want Google play access. John Doe The play store is not on every Android phone...its not on any phone in china for example and the Mobile Application Distribution Agreement is optional and Google chrome is not even set to default and is hidden in a folder on Samsung devices so no one is forcing anyone to do anything here. Middlefinger Its on every phone that has access to the play store. What china does is not relevant to this so dont deflect. You know full well what i was referring to, not that it will stop you claiming victory as is usual on here. Its not hidden, its right on the damn home screen on international unlocked OEM devices. John Doe You said "*EVERY* android phone has Google Chrome". There are plenty of Android phones that do not sign that agreement and do not have the play store on them also the agreement is negotiated with Google including what apps to include. This agreement is also signed with carriers so Google, OEMs and the carriers negotiate it. And yes it is hidden in the US carrier version because I had to go through the app list, open the folder, click on it to use it and also have to make it default...it is not set to default. This was on an S7 edge. https://landing.google.com/intl/en/androidisforusers/faq.html https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-4a46Ko8RE Middlefinger Newsflash, the world doesnt revolve around US carriers.. On the first point.. well done, you won on a technicality that neither of us were even talking about anyway. John Doe That is where OEMs sell the majority of their phones through carriers and specifically US carriers not international unlocked phones which samsung doesn't even update on time (But that is another issue). But even in the international unlocked phone I am sure the S7 also does not have chrome as the default browser. Middlefinger My Samsung devices do, as did my LGs, HTCs and so on (including network branded ones). Some US carriers may have other things installed and set to default, but its the exception in the world. Either way Google requires its bloat be installed, and i dont see that as any better than Samsungs. John Doe You may think is bloat but the billions of Google users out there do not think so go download what you like. Shame-sung C.E.O Swinesung Pay is Garbage. Don't fall for this guys Sheep Mentallity. This is the same person who said CURRENT-C was going to be the winner out of Payment wars LOL!! No joke he was the biggest shill for Months. Shame-sung C.E.O https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d20aef0fbc504aadabb8bd8fde48166d56c8b76806fd4b9f3e699fb0f3c88c9a.jpg https://media.giphy.com/media/l3E6uhDAN3W7vylji/giphy.gif LMFAO!!! LineOS for exynos! I know Samsung browser is based on chromium... But he say 'better' becouse ad blocker... If chrome have ad blocker is will be faster.. that for sure Suicide_Note Two hardly qualifies as 'many apps'. tim242 That was just two examples. Another example is Messages. I have to use Samsung Messages, because Google forces pop up messages, unless you silence them altogether. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages all the time, but I'm not aware of any pop-up messages. Or are you referring to the way the message notification pops up? tim242 Yes, the notifications. Google took the option out of the settings to disable that nonsense. Samsung put the option into their app. Why is Google forcing that on us? It is annoying to have them interrupt what I am doing, and disregards privacy Suicide_Note I like it since i can see if i need to reply immediately or not, or just dismiss it to the notification tray, but to each their own. Good thing we have so many options to choose from. 😊 tim242 Yeah, I would use Google Messenger, if only I could disable that. Knowing Google, they may add that back later. JohnyNoLegs Google doesn't even have an audio recording app LOL. Google has barely anything. Literally BARE Middlefinger amung browser is superior to chrome. A carrier Pigeon is better than chrome, at least Samsung internet actually exits properly when you press the back button. John Doe So go use a carrier pigeon...troll LoL If you like Samsung and their programming skills go buy a Tizen phone Middlefinger I prefer Samsung to Google anyway. Android is a damn mess and getting worse again. Sure 7 is better than the total disaster that was kitkat, but its worse than anything since KK. John Doe Ok so go get a Tizen phone http://www.samsung.com/in/smartphones/samsung-z3/ Middlefinger I prefer Samsungs mods to Android to Googles 'stock', Samsung actually seem to test it before breaking everyone devices. John Doe That is because everyone's device is already broken (Laggy, buggy, slow, and filled with unnecessary apps). Middlefinger Like most of the Google apps, yeah you're right. John Doe Google's apps are updated continually and are stable than the majority of OEM apps since they are mostly updated by OTA instead of through the play store like all of Google's apps. Anyways, that doesn't change the fact that Samsung's software is laggy and terrible...it also gets worse over time which is just sad. And the fact that they take forever to update their phones does not help your argument. Middlefinger Firstly thats horseshit, Google apps are just as unstable as any. Secondly Samsungs launcher can be laggy, jsut like Googles can be painfully limited, so dont use either. The rest of the Samsung mods are better than Googles, especially the notification pulldown. Ive already addressed the update thing. If Google was pushing 7.1.1 to every device in the world there would be hundreds of millions that randomly rebooted. The OEMs test better and it takes time. Older thats stable and fixed is better than newer and broken. John Doe Firstly thats horseshit, Google apps are just as unstable as any. I use Google's apps daily and they are not unstable actually they are highly rated in the play store compared to samsung's apps and are used by way more people that just shows how stable they are. Unless you are using beta version, heck even the beta version is stable so I have no idea what you are talking about. There are always problems with updates even Apple has them with iOS but the difference is Google can push out a fix quickly like Apple. Also with new updates you get security patches and fixes for older bugs that take months to fix when going through OEMs and carriers. If you think Samsung's programming is good go check the article you are commenting on LoL. Middlefinger So what if google can and does patch things quickly, it shouldn't get broken in the first place. This just doesn't happen with most OEM devices, and hasnt to a single one ive ever had. My Nexus devices have been a string of bad hardware, poor software, show stopping faults and RMAs. John Doe I have had several nexus devices and pixel and I have never had severe problems to a point where I had to send it in. There are bugs like any other OEM especially samsung but Google has the ability to fix them quickly. Newflash, it does happen with a lot of OEMs including Apple. This isn't new anyways Google's software is highly praised on the pixel compared to Samsung's "horseshit". Go check the reviews. Middlefinger Im sure the 9 people that have a Pixel just loved the reboots. Nice its fixed, shame it ever happened. Never had severe problem eh? Ive never had ANY with anything except the Nexus'. Highly praised is it? By who exactly? If its the same people that bought the Nexus then they are easily pleased and highly biased. You cant deny there is an entire body of fanboys out there that love AOSP, regardless of how bad it is. If google just secretly used all Samsungs code for 8 it would be the best thing ever, because bias blinds. John Doe 9 people? classy. Nice joke. Never had severe problem eh? Ive never had ANY with anything except the Nexus'. You just lost all credibility just stop. All the tech blogs gave it excellent reviews and said it was the best Android phone available even tech blogs that favor Apple said so and that says a lot. Middlefinger Yeah, OK. Zero Mizukami What didnt you like about kitkat? I was always under the impression kitkat was more or less the pinnacle of Android Audio Totally disagree. There are no Samsung apps on my S7 that I actually use. tim242 That's you. I use Samsung Pay every day, to pay for everything. Samsung's browser is far superior to Chrome. I use Samsung's SMS app, because Google forces pop up messages on theirs. F4LL0U7 That's your opinion, and of course I have my own. It was just a little frustrating when I started my work GS7 for the first time and saw two of nearly every app. As a Nexus/Pixel guy, I'm horrified at Samsung's terrible (in my opinion) design and functionality standards. Not to mention the 3rd party garbage they toss in there too. I had to purchase an app that allows me to disable their default apps. When your first task in the process of setting up a new phone is to wade through and remove the bloat, there's something wrong there. tim242 I purchased a package disabler as well. But I also had to disable a lot of Google bloatware as well. John Doe You need to look up the term bloatware. Lookup, Microsoft office, facebook, and all the other unnecessary apps that don't need to be preinstalled are bloatware. Anyways I don't know what I am arguing with you samsung phones are burning up...literally so unless samsung sells 100+ million s8 they will always be behind apple. tim242 Behind apple haha you are silly. John Doe Why is that silly? They are behind Apple in the smartphone business. tim242 That is not true. Get educated, then comment. John Doe Lmao http://www.techtimes.com/articles/188124/20161208/apple-iphone-7-is-the-best-selling-smartphone-in-us-trumping-the-samsung-galaxy-s7-kantar.htm https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/56f89a4335e2c7fe807cdebf208e142c62b61a5cec127b30c1f4b3c96aee3961.gif tim242 Lmao that is just the S7. Samsung has many other smartphones. You are trying to move the goalposts. Try harder John Doe http://bgr.com/2017/02/03/apple-vs-samsung-sales-2016/ http://www.businessinsider.com/samsung-galaxy-apple-iphone-premium-market-share-chart-2016-12 https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/10/16/samsung-galaxy-vs-iphone-which-product-line-has-so.aspx Apple beat Samsung with 3 Phones....Samsung had 31. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/13806899d2dd953b00745e25586ce63bc99bfb72ae0d42ccd3bbb42fa9c618b5.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78dd8b407e1ea19bc331dea202aae34c0cb0772bea409ff56a11d2efb86e7f9d.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/91444a76a0ec89e25770a31b864244d9c04aad4f64e7c6152e993058b5c82bb9.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/688053d5bd7c128160ba9a9dfe79639b542955188e91c63913e08ee14faa1f85.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e9eb24fa3eae7253df33b2eb97d2250c7c498213eec6de868a759657891aad6b.png JohnyNoLegs Yea like Pixel Launcher, Hangouts, Daydream haha byteseyes Google apps are definitely bloatware. There's tons of Google bloatware I delete every time I get a new device with Android on it. Granted, I think Samsung and Google should get a pass for including their software because it's Samsung's hardware and part Samsung and part Google's software. Completely 3rd party companies like carriers or Microsoft stuffing their software is the worst kind of bloatware. John Doe Google apps are not bloatware because people do use them and they are useful. Bloatware means apps that people don't use and waste space on your device. Google's apps definitly do not waste space and the majority of them are used so no they are not bloatware. These are the apps Google requires most are Google play apps: Google Chrome Google Maps Google Drive YouTube Gmail Google+ (The only one I think is unnecessary) Google Play Music Google Play Movies Google Play Books Google Play Newsstand Google Play Games Google Photos Hangouts (Probably stopped requiring it already) byteseyes Your conclusion that Google apps are not bloatware rests on the premise that people use them. By the same token, Samsung apps are not bloatware because people do use them and they are useful. Realistically, I can count on 2 hands the number of people I've come across who use Google Play Music, Movies, Books, Newsstand, Games, Photos, Hangouts, and Google+. Most people I know do use YouTube and Maps the most, while Chrome is forced onto people often. Drive is a wash. That means almost all of Google's apps are not commonly used, hence waste space. So don't you think it's unfair and untrue to make the assumption that people use Google apps, while simultaneously making the unfair and untrue assumption that people don't use Samsung apps? I personally love Samsung apps and I find most of Google's apps redundant. I can understand if people are vice versa. Haha, sorry, I didn't mean this response to be too long, so all boiled down, Samsung and Google apps are either both bloatware or both not. Hope you can understand that they can not be different. John Doe Fact is that far more people use Google's apps than Samsung's you can check the play store reviews and how many people use them. Google's services are used way more often than Samsung's that is a known fact. Google and Samsung do not release numbers of every single app but Google has a billion+ monthly active users on some of their services. When it comes to the Google play apps, they come in a package with the play store. It makes no fucken sense to have a music section in the play store and no app to play it with. They are a package. Chrome is not "forced" on people. You need to lookup what that word means and Chrome is not even set as default on samsung devices so how the hell is it "forced"? That means almost all of Google's apps are not commonly used, hence waste space. It is silly to make a statement like that So don't you think it's unfair and untrue to make the assumption that people use Google apps, while simultaneously making the unfair and untrue assumption that people don't use Samsung apps? No because like stated above Google has more than billion+ active users on their services and highly rated apps in the play store and they a regularly updated. Samsung on the other hand has even discontinued multiple apps and services because no one is using them like Samsung milk music. https://play.google.com/store/apps/collection/search_results_cluster_apps?clp=ggEJCgdzYW1zdW5n:S:ANO1ljLMiXA https://play.google.com/store/apps/collection/search_results_cluster_apps?clp=ggEICgZnb29nbGU%3D:S:ANO1ljIY5oM Bloatware apps are determined by the user and I am positive that more users find Google's apps in a favorable light than Samsung's. You are in the minority. byteseyes "Fact is that far more people use Google's apps than Samsung's you can check the play store reviews and how many people use them. Google's services are used way more often than Samsung's that is a known fact. Google and Samsung do not release numbers of every single app but Google has a billion+ monthly active users on some of their services." YouTube and Maps are the most popular. The majority of Google apps are not used at all by most people. But that doesn't matter. The point is lots of people use Google apps, and lots of people use Samsung apps too. You can't ignore one group of people even if it's one order of magnitude smaller. It's still a significant number. "When it comes to the Google play apps, they come in a package with the play store. It makes no fucken sense to have a music section in the play store and no app to play it with. They are a package." Many people don't use them. I'm just using your own assumption and logic. I personally deleted them. Whether it makes sense or not to include them is irrelevant. Of course from a company's perspective it almost always makes sense to include their own service. That's business. You're inclined to make justifications for Google but not for others. "Chrome is not "forced" on people. You need to lookup what that word means and Chrome is not even set as default on samsung devices so how the hell is it "forced"?" It's not forced on Samsung devices thank god. But anyway, instead of on smartphones, I was just remembering off the top of my head about the Chrome browser slipping its way into many people's computers, so I was going off a tangent there. "It is silly to make a statement like that" It's pure logic. "No because like stated above Google has more than billion+ active users on their services and highly rated apps in the play store and they a regularly updated. Samsung on the other hand has even discontinued multiple apps and services because no one is using them like Samsung milk music." Again, that's not the case for almost all of Google's apps. Most of Google's apps are not commonly used. Google also discontinues or leaves as zombies apps that no one uses. "Bloatware apps are determined by the user" That's what I've been saying all along. "and I am positive that more users find Google's apps in a favorable light than Samsung's. You are in the minority." Of course a software-centric company is going to have a larger user base. I may be in the minority, but it's still a large number of people. We're not talking about 1 user vs 1 million. If there's 1 user, and an app is installed to cater to that one 1 user, then it would be bad to include the app. But many, many, many people use Samsung apps too. You can't cherry pick what you like and ignore everything that others like. John Doe Exactly so going back to my original comment that Google's apps are not bloatware and that apps from Facebook, Microsoft, and Lookout are bloatware. Also when Samsung has two music apps like Google play music and Milk on their devices and they end up discontinuing Milk because no one uses it that is also bloatware. So I am glad we cleared up your confusion on whether Google's apps are "definitly bloatware" https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/04d006e4bd2b9525b0b0e9550444617ee69614c33bf605ad372243dc9af02410.png byteseyes Logic must not be your strong suit. John Doe Good Job nice comeback byteseyes Thanks. byteseyes I can understand your viewpoint. Me personally, I find most of Google's apps redundant because I really love Samsung's apps. I actually did the same as you haha! I purchased an app to delete all of Google's apps except Youtube and Maps and a few of Samsung's too. I think there are people who use Samsung apps and people who use Google apps. Not referring to you, but some people like to think Google apps are not bloatware because they themselves use them. But many people also love and use Samsung apps, myself included. Even though I love Samsung apps, I can totally understand if people are vice versa. Logically speaking, either both Samsung and Google apps are both bloatware or both not. dabug91 Lol, umm Samsung has it's own calendar app, calculator app, memo app, messaging app, etc and they're all shit. No phone has more bloatware than a Samsung phone. They win hands-down in that category. tim242 I prefer all of those to Google's offerings. I'm glad to have a choice. OligarchyAmbulance You honestly think they have higher standards for their lagfest Android skin? tim242 They have higher standards than Google/HTC with the dumpster fire that is Pixel. John Doe https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a1405ef722a16da1e676294296d43a0d524eaaf5c53be0f4ec6d89b9ab035eb1.gif M. Luciano What? Where are you getting all this? tim242 There have been numerous hardware issues reported since release. Some of which being the microphone, speakers, camera, and the display. tekfr33kn I've had my Pixel for a few months now and haven't had a single one of those problems. I know that a few people have had them but it's more rare than you you are making it out to be. Audio Or for Knox for that matter! Bob http://imgur.com/gallery/UrhOtai Middlefinger No it uses Android, which we all know is perfect/ s ... At least Samsung fixes the mess Google creates most of time though. Jumanji! Are you perhaps conflating user experience with quality/security of code? A company can make something look pretty or function, but that doesn't mean there aren't any issues with the security of their code. Computer science isn't an exact science and creating software is always a series of trade offs. Middlefinger No im basing it on all the problem Google has with its own devices and how much time OEMs have to spend fixing Google code before they release it on their own devices. Jumanji! What do you expect? Android is a big, complex platform and there are a number of OEMs who blend it with their own, unique hardware variations and services. It's absolutely normal for customers to find defects in shipping products. It's ultimately how the company reacts to customer facing defects and issues that really matters. I'd love to see a list of the volume of defects that OEMs have fixed in the Android platform. I think data has the potential of strengthening your arguments rather than having them appear to be nothing but hyperbole. Middlefinger Not all fixes they make is committed back to stock. Much of what the OEMs do is proprietary, but given that OEM devices dont have the problems AOSP based devices do its reasonable to say they fixed something. If all the Google devices had identical hardware you could argue the problem is which specific hardware, but thats not the case. Regardless of the hardware the problem persists because the problems are in Googles code. Zsolt V You are right in everything you wrote. Congrats, finally a sane voice. F4LL0U7 If that was sincere and not sarcastic, thanks! JohnyNoLegs Haha doesn't run Tizen. Fail. Google code their own bugs anyway. F4LL0U7 No shit, try reading the rest of the thread. Vivek Rameses That's odd, some people think Israel is worst place humanity has ever seen. Sruly J Do you get a thrill connecting politics go something totally not related to that?

But if they were to do that, I would surely dump them. The problem is, I don't care for any other Android manufacturer. HTC is not the proper ODM for Google, too many issues. Drunk Squirrel Did you even read what he said? He clearly said "dump TIZEN", "NOT Android"! Nicholas Conrad I don't think he really reads what anybody says. Drakenoid Which is why I blocked him ages ago and you should too. Middlefinger Yeah, because Android is so great. How many Nexus devices have rebooted randomly today i wonder? MJ That a thing? I don't recall my Nexus 7 which have had for three years ever randomly rebooting. I used a Nexus 5 actively for 2 1/2 years and remember a short period where I had to MANUALLY reboot it a couple of times a week. My Pixel XL has been stable and just as fast/smooth since day one. JohnyNoLegs Pixel XL here, required one RMA, 3 factory resets. Bluetooth is still dodgy. Google Play music is dodgy, it doesn't play for more than 30 mins without stopping audio. LOL at you thinking Google/Nexus?Pixel is any better LOLOLOLOLOL MJ OK, you had a bad phone. So? I have owned more than three Nexus/Pixel devices with no major issues. Regardless, I was responding specifically to the random rebooting issue the OP mentioned that I have never seen. JohnyNoLegs Nexus 5X random reboots. My wife RMA'd it within the first 6 months. 6P battery would die when it got to 30%, RMA'd that and the 6P i got, android system used loads of battery and I would barely get 1.5 hrs SOT even after factory resets. Then bought Note7, was leaps and bounds ahead of the Nexus 5X and 6P, except for the whole risk of exploding....THen I got the Pixel, which yea sure it's always fast at first, but it does so much less than the Note 7, and now my Pixel struggles at points anyway. I have owned every nexus except for the 6, I have also owned nearly all LG G series and Galaxy series. The most Issues I have had are with nexus devices, mostly to do with updates. Airoid Sammy is fu#ked Suicide_Note Hardly. It just means they'll be using Android for a good while longer. shadowx360 Samsung has at least matched (or surpassed) Apple in terms of design and manufacturing of hardware, but is Chinese-OEM level when it comes to software. Articles like these are why I stick with Pixel/Nexus devices. If they want to be taken seriously, they need to find competent software engineers - the GS8 announcement articles were shortly followed by articles showing you can beat the new facial recognition by using a flat photo. Suicide_Note To be fair, you can fool Google's facial recognition with a photo, too. OligarchyAmbulance To be fair, you can't unless you have a photo which blinks. Suicide_Note It's not at all hard to create a photo that 'blinks'. M. Luciano lol? for muggles? Ian Santopietro That actually blinks? No, that's impossible. But it's not hard to make a photo which tricks the software into thinking it blinked, which is why I assume that guy put 'blinks' in single-quotes. Suicide_Note You get it. Thank you. Carson Saldanha He's a wizard bruh Carson Saldanha Yes, that is "Smart Lock" and if I'm not mistaken, I think Google even put a warning of this. They also didn't advertise this as a "feature". Abhilash Bingi TBF Google also introduced the Face Unlock feature back in 2011 (with ICS and the Galaxy Nexus) which could be fooled by a photo. But it warned you that it's not completely safe and can be fooled by a photo when you tried to activate it. Joannaescott Google is paying $97 per hour!

Google likes to whip things up quick and throw spaghetti on the wall to see what sticks. There's lots of mistakes in that process. Also, Samsung specifically stated face unlock is not intended to be a secure locking method. They specifically said it's analogous to slide to unlock, so I don't understand why people are misunderstanding this as a "security flaw" when it's not. Justin That's why Google removed Face Unlock in Lollipop. Abhilash Bingi What? No. It just got renamed to 'Trusted face' and moved to Smart Lock along with 'Trusted places' location and 'Trusted Devices'. It's still an option on my Pixel. OligarchyAmbulance Same here. If this is how they treat their own OS, I have no hope for their version of Android. You're lucky if you even get a security patch from them. byteseyes Samsung's the only company out of all manufacturers that releases monthly security patches actually. Pretty awesome. OligarchyAmbulance No, Google does too. byteseyes I mentioned out of all manufacturers. Google's not a manufacturer. That's why I was pointing out that it makes Samsung special. OligarchyAmbulance The Pixel, Pixel C, Chromebook Pixel, Home, Chromecast, Chromecast Audio, Google WiFi, and Daydream would disagree with you. byteseyes Um, I thought it was quite obvious we're talking about phones, given that we're discussing Android and monthly security patches on smartphones. What does a laptop or a router have anything to do with smartphones? Besides, the Pixel phone was not manufactured by Google. Regardless, this doesn't change my original statement that Samsung is the only manufacturer that releases monthly security patches (for their smartphones, in case I wasn't explicit enough), and nobody considers Google a manufacturer, even with Google's nascent foray into the fringe hardware products you listed. In time, Google may become a manufacturer too. Who knows. OligarchyAmbulance "Google's not a manufacturer." "Um, I thought it was quite obvious we're talking about phones" Google is a manufacturer of many devices. That was the point. "Besides, the Pixel phone was not manufactured by Google" Right, and iPhones are made by Foxconn. So technically speaking, Apple has never updated an Apple device. byteseyes Um, you do realize you're arguing about absolutely nothing right now? I never denied Google updates their phone. I already knew Google updates their phone. I was stating that Samsung, a phone manufacturer, is the only OEM that releases monthly security patches, a direct contradiction to your initial statement "You're lucky if you even get a security patch from them." OligarchyAmbulance "Samsung, a phone manufacturer, is the only OEM that releases monthly security patches" They're the only OEM if you don't include another OEM. lol byteseyes Google's an OEM? Apple's OEM? That's news to everyone. tim242 Android's face unlock was the same. Besides, Samsung tells you that it is low security. You are just a nasty google sheep. EcE While I don't disagree, it's been 5 or 6 years. If Samsung was going to implement it, at least try harder. My guess is that it was a last minute addition due to the rumored onscreen fingerprint sensor they had to ditch. Shame-sung C.E.O Says the Current-C Shill who is a sheep to Swinesung now. Carson Saldanha Have I ever agreed on anything with you? tim242 I am not sure. But you should more often : ) Carson Saldanha -___________________________________________- Shame-sung C.E.O This has nothing to do with Apple. SWINESUNG is a huge dishonest,Corrupt,Horrible company who will be always known for stealing , profit, sued, settle. Speculation on what Apple is going to do = Nothing. The sad Truth is that Pathetic TIZEN Garbage OS will always be a Rip off iOS,Android & Windows and WebOS . Swinesung does nothing Original and does it half baked like all its product. FAIL FAIL FAIL. Peter World Citizen Your Korean boyfriend left you recently? ;) Shame-sung C.E.O why are you sharing what your mother told you? Kind of random LOL!! Defenestratus Google's software development isn't by any means stellar either. John Doe It is definitly more secure than Samsung and better designed. Google has a project zero team so find security flaws and it works great...I wonder why they haven't looked at Tizen OS lmao Zsolt V It's by not stellar you mean that it's the best out of all commercial companies you are right.... QwertyJuan To be fair... if you lose your phone, there is a HIGH chance that the person finding it has NO idea who you are, doesn't possess any pictures of you, thereby making the facial recognition feature a decent level of security. No... it won't stop your younger brother or one of your friends from "hacking" your phone when you are asleep. :) P.S. Samsung ALSO has a retina scanner built into the phone which is actually MORE secure than even a fingerprint scanner and for some reason we hear NOTHING about this feature. whispy_snippet It's less secure for the very reasons you just outlined. It's easier to get a photo of someone than their fingerprint. Drakenoid Not if you're a common thief, then it's easier to get their fingerprints off the phone than their pic. whispy_snippet I'm sceptical that a common thief has the tools and/or technical know-how to obtain and then exploit someone's finger print. It's not easy. Drakenoid True, but it's then also unlikely for them to get photo of the owner. My name is…. Oh yes, the classic douche that says "that's why i stick with Pixel/Nexus devices" Because Android was never full of holes or the Pixel deserves the iphone-like price tag. Zsolt V It's better than an iPhone, so why shouldn't it be priced so? Justin You know what's worse than GoPro Sheeps? Nexus Sheeps. YaKillaCJ Hold up now, while I agree that Samsung suck in the software department, I disagree with the Chinese OEM part. Let's not forget that Xiaomi has the best update record, even surpassing Google depending how ya look at it. Also OnePlus has been really good and ZTE not bad at all. Zsolt V What does update speed have anything to do with this topic? jodieisme Security patch..? Zsolt V So Samsung doesn't deliver timely monthly patches? mma173 Xiaomi is a way better than Google. MIUI has so many advantages over the other Android roms. But the one has to admit that they took their "inspiration" from Apple :) especially in the early days. Drakenoid True, I wish they would update the basic usability of MIUI to be more in line with Android, specially now that Android does a lot of things better. They don't have to serve Google's Android just an updated version with better design. I love their features though. Though Xiaomi doesn't provide security patches to Mi 5 as fast as they should. Zsolt V So you 3D print a face, no difference. Adam Truelove Agree, Stock Android managed by Google running on an S8 would be wonderful. Samsung makes great hardware, but absolute garbage software. JohnyNoLegs Samsung states it isn't secure man. SAM I had read about Tizen code and management and no wonder this article makes sense. Read what other programmers had to say abt tizen https://what.thedailywtf.com/topic/15687/code-review-malediction https://what.thedailywtf.com/topic/15001/enlightened Suicide_Note I view Tizen as being akin to the dark language of Mordor, and should never be spoken of. marcusmarcus2 What? Now you just made Tizen sound kinda cool. Jordan Palmer Well done. Bewear Die, T(ouchW)izen, die. YouNex That's why #NeverSamsung JohnyNoLegs Yea, go with some other small company that must have great developers and code review policies...LOL Audio This has always been my fear about tizen and why I can't buy the gear s3 watch, ESPECIALLY for using Samsung Pay. It also makes me wonder about Samsung Knox, tbh... Sruly J Isn't part of Knox incorporated into Android for Work? Audio Is it? I always assumed it was separate... Doesn't Knox pre-date Android for Work? Defenestratus Yes it is integrated into Android's Security apparatus and yes, it pre-dated Android for Work (which as far as I can tell is vaporware). saf1927 Android for Work is useful to use it as way to have multiple app profiles. There's an app on the Play Store that create a work profile you can manage yourself by adding apps, etc. LineOS for exynos! Call island Sruly J Don't remember the article, but this article says that part of Knox was incorporated into Android. http://www.zdnet.com/article/google-samsung-integrate-knox-into-android-eye-enterprise-gains/ Shame-sung C.E.O LMFAO!! For years i been saying the same-thing. TIZEN OS is just pure Trash. Swinesung has always had lower standards then free boostmobile phones and Software that should be on V-Tech phones at the least( no insult to V-tech). How ever we all know Swinesung is not Special and has never been special. It's just a Sheep Mentality. Good thing there is Nexus who gives you Amazing Hardware and Software not Bloatware and Half baked products like the ones Swinesung makes. Another Fail from Swinesung. Aaron Uh, you know Nexus isn't a thing anymore, right? Middlefinger Samsung probably spends so much time fixing Googles mess on Android for its devices that there is no time for Tizen.. tekfr33kn You mean f-ing up Android - Fix'd it for ya. Middlefinger How can they f it up when they make it actually work without causing the phone to reboot randomly. Thats an Android fault that affects a number of totally different devices, its not hardware, its Googles software, again. Googles UX is just getting old now, and while yes, Touchwiz was poor in places Grace UX is far superior to whatever the hell Google is doing. Its more logical, provides more information in a better way and is fully themeable. Adam Margeson Having owned the original Android device (HTC Dream), a Nexus 5 and a Pixel on top of several others, Google's devices tend to be the more stable ones in my experience. It's other OEMs like Sony, HTC and others that tend to have problems because of code they precariously stack on top of Android. I'm not saying that Samsung's is better or worse than others', but Stock Android has been fairly stable for me. As to "Google's UX is getting old now",.. As compared to what? Samsung's is really just a highly integrated theme on top of Google's UX. Sure, the settings are moved around, the quick settings look a little different, etc, but what about General "Android" is getting old? JohnyNoLegs My experience is the opposite. Having had RMA'd my Pixel XL twice, and had to Factory Reset a few more times, that's more than all my phone prior. Given the latest Bluetooth bugs and Google Play Music bugs, I think you are just floating on cloud 9 oblivious to reality. I have come from Samsung, LG and HTC. My Nexus 5x is a whole other story, it has been even worse haha Adam Margeson My normal vehicle doesn't have Bluetooth, but the rentals I used for several weeks during the time (2017 KIA Sonata, 2016 Ford F350 and 2016 Ford Taurus) that the bug was active didn't seem to have any issues - in fact, they were overly aggressive in trying to connect even when I didn't want it to. I also don't generally use Google Play Music. So, no, I haven't been on Cloud Nine, I just haven't had the same issues other people have. That said, I was hit by the audio-clipping-at-loud-volumes bug that was there for a couple months. That was mildly (/s) annoying. I only factory reset my Nexus 5 a handful of times over the 3.5 years that I used it, and that was more a matter of having far too many apps and background services running to the point that I just reset it rather than cleaning it up. I have read AP every day since I found the site back when the Galaxy Nexus was released, and I am well aware of the bugs other people have been having. I count myself lucky that I haven't been seen most of those bugs personally. Middlefinger None of it is 'stacked on top of stock'. Its a replacement for it, the stock code isnt there. Almost all OEM android is virtually a fork, and there is no reason why i cannot be better than Googles version. whispy_snippet This is the guy who labels people "Google shills". Middlefinger Who am I shilling for? Samsung because I have their phone, LG because I have their TV, or Microsoft because i have their Tablet? Maybe im just not happy with the state of Android at the moment.. Nah, i must be a paid Samsung troll obviously. whispy_snippet So? What's your point? I have a Surface, an LG TV and a Pixel. But everyone knows phones are the most important piece of tech a person owns which is why they generate such intense discussion. You seem like a huge Samsung "shill" and a massive hypocrite. Middlefinger Everyone knows that do they? Sure if you say so, maybe if you are 14. Funny ive been accused of being a shill for Google as well, so it seems to to depend on the bias of the accuser, namely, you. whispy_snippet You're kidding. So you disagree that the smartphone is the most important and innovative piece of consumer technology this century? Mate, what planet are you living on? Middlefinger I didnt say it wasnt (it was actually invented last century, but whatever). I said its not the most essential to everyone. whispy_snippet I didn't say it was invented this century, but whatever. The statement "everyone knows" was an unbelievably poor choice of words and I can't believe I actually wrote it. But my broader point that smartphones are the most important piece of consumer technology this century still stands. My other point, that you're a hypocrite, also still stands. whispy_snippet Oh yeah. For sure man. You got it. M. Luciano This makes sense. Samsung doesn't know mobile security. They have Knox, which they purchased and then had fixed by BlackBerry. We have notifications constantly about people's dryers and refrigerators being hacked, their TV's being hacked and the only way they get out of it on Android is because someone else is handling 90%+ of the legwork, ie. Google. JohnyNoLegs Knox is better than AOSP. M. Luciano I don't believe that at all, but even if true, the point was they didn't create that. JohnyNoLegs Why would that matter who created it? keithzg Because it speaks to their ability to write good, secure software, which is what's in question here. JohnyNoLegs Well they didn't write it, so then it should be great then by your logic. You are also ASSUMING, that all dev's/dev teams/products are done by the same people, which would be a huge assumption that is probably very wrong. Samsung didn't even code Tizen anyway. M. Luciano Because if they'd have built it, they'd probably understand something about security. But they bought it and then had BlackBerry improve it. JohnyNoLegs So thats a good thing right? ast00 At the end of the day, it's still Samsung. Not surprised. Rod Samsung and poor software? Not surprised. Marty What else is new? Samsung's not known for quality software. They've gotten better with Touch-Wiz, but that's their pinnacle. Peter World Citizen All compilers should just mark strcpy() as error. ;) bekifft Worse than this, Tizen runs on refrigerators, and all that other "smart" crap. People are connecting this junk to the internet and forgetting about it. This is the kind of stuff that causes problems like Mirai. JohnyNoLegs Linux runs on refrigerators, and all that other smart crap. Are you saying the devs that made all that smart crap did it better? Andy J So..... um...... anyone know what the SmartThings hubs run on then? Are we facing a potential situation where they could be hijacked. D13H4RD2L1V3 Here's something, though. Tizen technically isn't made by Samsung entirely. It's a project within the Linux Foundation and developed and overseen by the Tizen Association. As you'd expect, Samsung is a member, but so are other companies such as Huawei and Intel. Despite that, only Samsung has actually implemented the OS in their products. Given the shocking number of security holes, I can only assume that it was far from ready. Even though Samsung's Android skin is better than previous iterations, I don't particularly hold it in super-high regard because software has never been Samsung's forte. And I think they should make it so soon as their hardware gets better and better. Đức Thành I am not the least bit surprised, but that part about the legacy of Bada OS living on was particularly hilarious. mma173 Software industry especially OSs is a very specialized resource-intensive field. I wish Samsung should give up working on OSs to free up resources. ROB Can he also work on getting Nougat to the unlocked S7s ?

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Using the Windows Store’s Universal Apps exclusively for a week was an exercise in frustration -8 by Michael Allison  @Mkeallison Apr 5, 2017 at 14:20 GMT17 hours ago I took on an experiment where I would use Microsoft universal Windows Store apps for a week rather than using desktop apps to try and pre-empt what life would be on a Windows 10 Cloud powered PC. With the exception of Slack, I attempted to use Microsoft’s Universal apps like Edge in lieu of Google’s Chrome, OneNote in replacement of OneNote 2016 and the Office Mobile suite instead of the Office 2016 app. I also downloaded and installed the OneDrive app and switched back to Groove Music on my PC instead of using iTunes for Apple’s Music service like I was used to. Overall I had a mixed experience, I was able to get away with using just Store apps for a day or two, before the cracks began to show. Like most desktop users, much of my computer usage involves using the internet. In essence, a powerful browser with extension support for things like Adblock Plus (for a few sites with out of control ads), Grammarly for helping with writing, and while a bunch of other extensions I’m currently trying out to streamline my online workflow. When it comes to extensions, Edge only has a few. There’s support for the Adblock Plus which has whitelist support and send to OneNote and EverNote for quickly taking notes and clipping pages, as well as Amazon Assistant for streamlining online shopping. When you step out of that limited circle though just like the Windows Store, there’s barely anything else. There aren’t any Google extensions (shocker), nor are there any that change your new tab page to maximize productivity. Pocket on Chrome integrates with the New Tab page to show me stories that I’m generally interested in saving and reading later on Pocket’s iPhone app, and there are extensions to quickly show you the weather as well. Most painfully, however, Edge has issues with performance for me. I won’t attempt to generalize my experience to every single person who uses Edge, but my experience with using Edge for any sustained period of time leads to frustration, lost work, and freezing. This is consistent whether I use my PC on Insider builds, freshly reset or otherwise. I wish I could say I stuck with Edge for the full week, but I ended up bailing on the browser – s tool that gets in the way isn’t very useful. OneNote is a generally excellent app from the store and one of the few standout universal Windows apps in my opinion. Most of the time, it worked just as you would expect, allowing text input and file attachment. However, I often had to open the full OneNote 2016 app because OneNote would inexplicably freeze while syncing, preventing you from working until it continues syncing. If I was in spotty internet area, I may as well have kissed my productivity goodbye because the app would just sit there trying to sync for minutes. As for the rest of the Office Mobile suite, they are fairly useless on the desktop due to lack of any form of multi-instance support as well as their penchant for freezing when large files or documents are opened. I won’t go into details because Microsoft has now marked them as “Mobile Only” in their store page using large fonts to pre-empt complaints from PC users who download them, but you probably shouldn’t consider using these apps for extended work on your PC. Groove Music is a decent music app and looks rather nice —especially after its recent interface updates. I have nothing bad to say about it. It actually works better than both iTunes and Spotify for me personally, and all I do is stream music using Groove Pass and listen to playlists. It doesn’t do anything advanced, but what it does do, it does competently. The bottom line here is that probably you can use universal Windows apps solely on your PC if you have the stomach for it. However, this isn’t desirable – and the reason for this remains the same as in Windows 8 and Windows RT. Windows Store apps just don’t offer the capability that can be found via traditional Windows apps – and if they can no one’s exploited it as of yet. There are many useful apps for sure, but those apps are mostly apps which make sense on a mobile phone and tablet and less so on a desktop or laptop – like the many to-do list apps you can find in the store. Microsoft’s own in-box apps like Calendar and Mail are useful for basic users, but they pale in comparison to desktop apps for the same tasks and aren’t as useful as their equivalent web-apps. Groove Music is a capable and competent music service, but iTunes and Spotify are more powerful and have the advantage of being better on mobile platforms people actually use. OneNote is relatively full featured, but a few head scratchers here and there and the lack of theming support make OneNote 2016 more desirable. While Skype is already the worst chat app known to man, it somehow manages to perform even more poorly as a universal app. What makes this disappointing is that Microsoft had the same problems in 2012. Windows 8, the Surface RT and original Surface Pro were panned both for a lack of viable Windows store apps and the relative uselessness and toylike nature of the included apps. Microsoft may have dressed these apps up in fancier, more appropriate clothes, but they still remain toylike in comparison. Universal apps aren’t a bad idea, and Microsoft is still working on them, trying to make them better, they just aren’t there yet. For consumers, this isn’t a problem. They simply do not care, and they don’t have to. Universal apps don’t bring any tangible benefits, they are simply re-wrapping tools we already have in packages that few seem to want. With the demise of Windows phone where UWP made the most sense, one might even consider this as a form of shuffling the decks on the titanic. For Microsoft and the few dedicated Windows store developers, perhaps it’s time to consider that it isn’t that time is running out for UWP, but that it already died along with Windows phones.

Google Photos details info page shows you the people inside a photo Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/04/05 5:54am PDTApr 5, 2017 35 Plus 1 on G+ 33 Share on Facebook 55 Share on Twitter Total Shares123 Applications Google News Google Photos is really good at recognizing people in a photo and grouping their pics together. It's one feature I've come to rely on to find all the photos I have of specific friends or family members and even photos of "person X and person Y and person Z" together. But there were still a couple of small things missing from Photos' facial recognition like the option to manually tag a person in a pic or the ability to see who Google had recognized in a photo from the photo itself, not their dedicated page. But the latter is now implemented. Actually, it was implemented at some point in the last few versions: I can confirm that it wasn't there in 2.10.0.148909749 but it is live in 2.12.0.151124741, so it was added to Photos sometime between March 13 and 30. Small details aside, this is a simple but nice change. When you tap in the Info icon on any photo while you're browsing your library, you will see a new People section below Description and above Details. In it are thumbnails of all the people Google has recognized in your pics. You can tap the thumbnail to immediately go to that person's dedicated Photos page with all the albums and pictures they're in. Zaher is a very dear friend with an undying love for Android. I'll make him pay for the free publicity. This is a great way to see who Google has tagged in your photos and to jump to individual people's photos without searching for them first. It still doesn't seem to be possible to manually tag someone in your Photos but I'd imagine the function is coming at some point. Google Photos 2.12.0.151124741 has been live on the Play Store for a few days but it's also on APK Mirror if you prefer to grab it there.

Trying to switch to one of these accounts in Google Photos causes the app to crash, and it has been this way since version 2.10.0 Ibrahim Yusuf You're right it crashes on me too makapav I believe, brand accounts/pages were deprecated a long time ago. vwnut13 Creating a new Brand Account is still available on both Google+ and Youtube. Actually, it's not only available, but there is a direct link to create a Brand Account on the Google+ homepage. Suicide_Note Now we just need to be able to manually tag people in a photo. Capt4chris And for search to include shared albums. :-) chris mellor Im on 2.12 and still dont have this feature. johnforamerica Bring back the damn cloud backup icon on individual thumbnails! Since that went away, no way to tell which photos are backed up! (Other than opening each individual photo) Suicide_Note Agreed. It would be nice to have that back. Dennis Ulijn It'll tell you everything's backed up or how many items still need to backed up. I understand not every solution is perfect for everyone, but what would the clutter of a cloud symbol in each photo solve? johnforamerica It would solve exactly what I described. I selectively back up, I don't want everything backed up. With a library of thousands of pictures, you tell me how to figure out which have not yet been backed up... As it functions now, I have NO IDEA what is backed up or not unless I use one of two crappy options: 1) Click on each pic individually to view the cloud icon showing backup status 2) Try to cross reference my device photos with the web version to see "what's missing" It seems pretty clear to me that Google wants to push its users to use the auto backup function, and this is just another step in trying to compel that usage. Dennis Ulijn Okay, fair enough. Thomas Stockx Is this a US only feature? I've been using Google Photo's for ages on my Nexus 6, 6P, and Pixel, but Google is unable to give me search results for any name. Dennis Ulijn Yes. Use a VPN to enable it once, and then it keeps working. You'd have to put in the names yourself though, but after that it keeps adding photos of that person. Florian Reisinger Where to enable it? Dennis Ulijn I think it's the option called 'face grouping'. I use tunnelbear to create a vpn to america. Ailín Ó’S Apparently it's against EU law or something to do that so it's not in Europe. But once you enable it once it works always. rumanuu76 Yep I visited USA, it started working and now always works 😎 towo Still not available in Germany. *sigh* Fruity101079 With a VPN (or chrome extension), fake your location and access google photos , you will be able to enable it. towo Doesn't seem to populate any face matches, though, or does it just take a long time? Jack Smith I need to be able to tag my pets Fruity101079 We still can't change the location of the picture (don't know why, some of them are completely wrong...) thespacecowboy This has been a feature for a long time. Go to Assistant, then Search, then it'll bring a long horizontal list of photos. Click on those, and it will bring all the people it 'knows'. Click on someone it doesn't know and name them, and it'll tag those people in all your photos so you can search them. therealbiglou Yes, we are all aware. This isn't the point of this article. Rita El Khoury That's not what this is. Re-read the post please. thespacecowboy But Rita. Reading is hard! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/1849b9b0acd9cc0f34a50f0fb75f93662013c9cd00535267a4111a9bffb739c5.jpg 4Ui812 Reading is easy , comprehension is hard. Cecil Hardwood This only works for faces/people Google sees. I have lots of photos that for whatever reason Google has not identified any people in them or maybe 1 out of 3. It would be nice to be able to go back and add the ones Google missed. 4Ui812 You're a good looking lady Rita. It's a nice picture , you should use this one as your avatar. Peter Garlinski I'm assuming you're going to get at least a couple good bottles of beer for giving your friend publicity. Rita El Khoury Given how many times I've screenshotted stuff with him in it, I have to ask for at least one Pixel XL :p Vinayak Prabhu This is completely off topic. I noticed that you are using a S7 Edge.. How has it hold up after a year? Is there noticeably lag every now and then? m33d Rita's eyebrows be lookin' "on fleek!" Rita El Khoury Had to Google that. Thanks :) Kevin Chapple But, regrettably STILL not available in the UK.. ANY idea when this will be 'fixed' for the UK? jwildman16 Some others here stated that you can enable a VPN to a U.S. location, start adding names to faces, and then it will continue to do so after the VPN is disconnected. Matthew Merrick Doesn't matter. My Google Photos facial recognition wipes itself every 2 weeks for some godforsaken reason, rendering the service's most useful ability irrelevant, considering it rebuilds at not even one photo per day.

Contributor, beware of PageRank-hoarding publishers So you've found a great site to contribute content to -- or have you? Columnist Stephan Spencer provides advice for how to evaluate potential publishers for SEO benefits. Stephan Spencer on April 5, 2017 at 9:14 am More So you’ve written an amazing piece and scored the placement of your dreams. It took hours of blood, sweat and tears to brainstorm the topic, develop a clever hook, write the copy and source compelling imagery — not to mention the research and the outreach required to score the perfect publisher. And now you eagerly await the payoff: that hard-earned “link love” to drive up your Google rankings. Well, unfortunately, depending on where it was published, you may be waiting a long time. Let me let you in on a dirty little secret: publishing your content on many popular sites gives you zero SEO benefit. Huffington Post changes the game Last year, The Huffington Post, a popular site for bloggers to get more exposure and links to their sites, substantially changed their contributor platform — and not for the benefit of its contributors. Now, unless a HuffPo editor decides to feature your article, the articles you create for the Huffington Post are tagged with the meta robots noindex tag. This tag tells Google and the other search engines not to allow the page into the search engine’s index, or database. Consequently, your article will only see traffic from you sharing it with your own audience via social media or your email list. It won’t be in the search engine index (so no searches will turn it up), nor will you be able find it by browsing or searching within the Huffington Post site. Yes, some selected articles will be featured (and for those, the noindex tag will be removed), but for most authors, their article will be lost in the Invisible Web. Use of nofollow torpedoes the SEO benefit for you Noindexing contributed articles is not a common practice, so let’s talk about a more common one that also removes most of the SEO benefit from your published content. This practice is widespread and one you need to watch out for. When publishing articles from guest authors, most publishers include an attribution along with the article. The attribution, or bio, shares a few sentences about the author and often contains a link back to the author’s website. This link, along with any self-referencing links that you included in the main body of the article, is where SEO comes in; as I’m sure you know, acquiring more high-quality, relevant backlinks is what helps your site rank in the Google search results. However, I find that many publishers will add a rel=nofollow attribute to all the links in your article (e.g., SheKnows community, LinkedIn Pulse), or just to the links in your byline/bio (e.g., Inc.com). Some will do it selectively to some articles, but not others (like here on LifeHack.org, where I was one of the unlucky ones who got the nofollow treatment). You’ll even find some major publishers nofollowing the links contained within the articles written by their own staff (like in this example from Self.com). So much for getting the full value out of your public relations initiatives! Some popular sites even use a meta robots nofollow, which nofollows every single link on the page (for example, check out this BuzzFeed-sponsored post). Like the meta robots noindex tag, the use of meta robots nofollow (or of rel=nofollow on specific links) is not immediately apparent, so unless you are in the habit of viewing the HTML source of web pages or you have one of the tools I cover later in this article, you are none the wiser that these links provide your site no SEO benefit. Rel=nofollow signals to Google and the other search engines that the publisher doesn’t vouch for the link. The publisher is essentially saying: “I don’t trust where this link is pointing to, don’t bother crawling it.” Given the link is not vouched for, none of the SEO authority of the source site will pass through. Using the rel=nofollow tag became more common after Google stepped up its efforts against link spam in recent years. Guest posts with keyword-rich text links were a target of Google link spam penalties, even if the article was well written. Many publishers, instead of vetting the contributors and their articles more carefully, instituted the policy of using the rel=nofollow for links included in guest contributions. So without regard for your hard work, these publishers are eliminating any SEO benefit from the article for your site. Now, all is not lost. You can still get an increase of direct click-through traffic from a well-received and shared article. And of course you get more brand exposure. But the application of rel=nofollow to a link means that that link won’t contribute to your search engine rankings one bit. Wouldn’t you prefer to get both exposure and the SEO benefit? 3 tips for finding SEO-friendly sites for publishing your content Here are three checks you should add to your research process when you are looking for placement targets for your content marketing efforts: Check #1: Are there links to the authors’ sites? On a site that you are considering as a target for your content marketing efforts, look at existing contributed articles and see if you can find links to the authors’ sites. Oftentimes, the author’s name links to an internal page rather than to the author’s website. That alone waters down potential PageRank-passing power from the article, since it is an extra step away from the article. Then, you need to check if that author page passes PageRank to the author’s site. In the case of Entrepreneur.com and Mashable.com, it does — though it would be ideal if these sites linked directly from the article. If your goal is to acquire “do follow” links for your site directly from your contributed articles, strike these sorts of sites off your target list and move on. Check #2: Is there an editorial review in place? High-quality sites care about the content they publish and will have a review process in place to vet contributed articles. Authoritative sites will (and do) ask you to revise your article until it meets their standards, and they can be choosy about the topics they’re interested in publishing. Huffington Post’s recent change stems from their desire to decrease the load on their blog team. Posts that now publish on the platform no longer go through a review but, as we explained above, are also not visible in search unless singled out by an editor to feature. This makes HuffPo more of a platform than an actual publisher, which brings me to the point I want to make here: if there are no hoops to jump through aside from creating an account, then it’s likely that your post will not have the SEO impact that you desire. Check #3: Are the outbound links nofollowed? For our third (and most important) check, unless you want to look at source code, you will need a tool to check the outbound links for a rel=nofollow tag on the guest articles on your candidate site. Here are a couple of options for tools you can use to highlight nofollowed links: MozBar. Use of MozBar requires creating a free account with Moz.com. Once installed, you have a handy tool in your browser (available for both Chrome and Firefox) that will not only tell you whether a link has been tagged as nofollow, but also allows you to see whether the meta robots tag has been set. Click on the pencil icon in MozBar and then on “no-followed,” and all nofollowed links will be highlighted for you. Use the page analysis icon to look at the “General Attributes” of a page to see if the meta robots tag has been set. Nofollow browser extensions. I like NoFollow Simple, which is available for Chrome, Safari, Firefox and Opera. Add these checks to your vetting process By adding the above checks to your vetting of content marketing targets, you will save yourself a lot of wasted effort when it comes to improving your SEO. There are plenty of good publishers out there who will help your SEO by publishing your article with followed links, as long as you write a valuable article for their audience and stick to a branded link in your bio. Be smart with your time. Savvy contributors are aware of which publishers have policies that are not beneficial for their SEO.

While I’m sure you don’t want to constantly play “bad cop” patrolling the internet for copy cats, today lawyer/photographer Kiffanie Stahle offers some tangible ways for addressing these issues. –Stephanie Read the full post after the jump… One morning you are going to wake up and find out that someone has stolen content from your website. (Um-hum, if you haven’t discovered this already.) While for both legal and ethical reasons this shouldn’t be happening, we Biz Ladies need to live in the real world and accept that this is the reality. I also bet that your to-do list looks like mine and is a never-ending list sprawled across Evernote, Moleskine notebook, email inbox, and several 3×5 index cards. I don’t want to make that list longer, so today I’m going to share with you the four tools I use to track down where else my website content appears online and the process I use when those tools find a match. Track Down Text Stealers Even with the biggest network of fans, it would be impossible to find each instance of stolen website content. Luckily, there are two amazing tools that will let you quickly determine where else your text is appearing online. Copyscape Plagiarism Checker. This free tool searches the Internet for similar content. All you have to do is provide the URL. I like this tool because it finds both similar and exact matches. So even if your text stealer changes a couple things here or there, the tool will find it. The downside of this tool is that unless you pay for their premium service you cannot search several URLs at the same time or save your searches to repeat at a later date. Thus, if you want to search for hundreds of blog posts, you have to copy and paste them into the search bar one by one. My Copyscape workflow: Since I don’t have the time to search every single post every month, I’ve made the (random) decision to search my top five posts each month. Using that month’s Google Analytics statistics, I find the most popular posts and then run each of those URLs through Copyscape. I’ve found that this process takes about 15-20 minutes a month. Google Alerts. Part of the reason that I only utilize Copyscape for my top five posts is because of Google Alerts. What many people don’t know is that when you set up a Google Alert you are telling Google to perform an automatic search on the schedule you determine and send you an email if any new results appear. This means you can pick key sentences out of each blog post (and each static webpage), create a Google Alert by putting that sentence in quotation marks and Google will automatically search and notify you when that sentence appears anywhere on the Internet. Pretty freakin’ amazing, right?! (And yes, I might have a slight love affair with Google Alerts and all of the ways it saves me time running my business.) My Google Alerts workflow: Each time I publish a new page/post on my website I determine the one or two “core” phrases within that post. For example, in this one I might pick “a never-ending list sprawled across Evernote, a Moleskine notebook, and several 3×5 index cards” or “I might have a slight love affair with Google Alerts.” Usually what I’m looking for is a unique phrase. I then pop over to Google Alerts and create an alert to send me an email of all of the results at least once a day (found in the advanced options). At that point I can totally forget about it and Google takes the reigns. Google searches for me and shoots me an email when those phrases appear somewhere else. I only have to spend a few minutes each week reviewing the results (I filter them out into their own folder to prevent inbox clog). It’s an amazing, super simple, and automatic tool to tracking your written content all over the Internet. Track Down Image Stealers Just between the social media sites, you could make it your full-time job to try to track down each place that your images appear. I wish I had a tool as amazing as Google Alerts for images, but the best free tools available require elbow grease. Google Image Search. Google’s tool can be used in one of four ways: —drag and drop the image onto their search page —enter the URL of the image onto their search page —upload an image to their search page —install an extension in your browser allowing you to right-click the image you would like to search from any webpage Like Copyscape, there isn’t a way to save your searches or run multiple searches at once, you have to search image by image. However, there is one trick that you should know about: you can limit your search-by date. My Google Images workflow: Like Copyscape, I have a list of the five most important images to my brand that I search each month. The first time I performed the search, I searched since the beginning of time. Now, I limit my results to the timeframe since my last search. The first time this process took me an hour and a half, now it usually runs 20-30 minutes. Tineye. Tineye utilizes the same four search methods as Google Image Search. Tineye also allows you the ability to not only limit your searches by date, but save your searches. The one clear disadvantage, however, is the size of its database: only about 6 billion images, a small fraction of the images on the Internet. My Tineye workflow: I’ve got the same five important images saved as searches in my free Tineye account and run the search for new results since my last search. Since Tineye’s database is small this takes me about 5-10 minutes each month. Taking Action What do you do when you find a website using your content without your permission? I first look at the site, do an initial gut check and ask myself a series of questions: Why are they using this content? Are they passing it off as their own? Are they crediting me? Are they making money off of my content? Does the site look like a content scraper site? Does the site look reputable? The reason I’m asking these questions is to determine if this exact use helps or hurts my business. If I decide they are helping my business, I just double check to make sure they are crediting me as I’d like. If they are not, I personalize the following canned response and send it to the website owner: Dear [Website Owner Name], [Something nice about their site.] Thank you so much for featuring my work on your site! As a content creator myself, I often struggle with determining how to credit someone else’s work. Would you mind changing the credit to [credit desired] and providing a link back to the following page on my website [desired link]? [Final nice thought about their site.] Thanks again for featuring me, I’m so glad my content resonated with you and your audience! Cheers, Kiffanie I usually give them a couple weeks to make the change before pinging them a reminder. If I decide that their use hurts my business, then I’ve got a couple options. If a U.S. web host hosts the content, then sending a DMCA Takedown Notice to their web host is a simple, cost-effective solution to remove the content. I send a cease and desist letter if a U.S. web host doesn’t host the content, the content is offline, or if they are profiting off of my content. I’m lucky enough to be able to send these on my own law firm letterhead, so I generally get a response. However, I know many creatives who effectively send these letters. That’s it! I hope these tools and resources help you track down where else your content is appearing online. Suggested For You Small Business Focus: Growing Flower Haus, Part 1 How To Be Your Own Boss Life & Business: Agatha Achindu of Yummy Spoonfuls Comments Sarah says: August 12, 2014 at 1:43 pm I recently saw a well known artist/illustrator have a social media freak out about someone copying her work. The woman who attempted to steal from her wasn’t doing a very good job, and I doubt was making a lot of profit from unskillfully copying her ideas. She linked to the thief’s etsy shop, probably sending said thief the gift of more traffic than she’d ever received. While I agree that what happened to the artist was infuriating, I found her response to be incredible immature and poorly handled. If you’re going to approach someone about copying you, I suggest you do it in private (unless it’s a big corporation like urban outfitters). reply Deborah says: April 5, 2017 at 8:38 am Agree with you, Sarah. It’s always looks not professional, when things like these are done in public. Before publishing any angry messages and blaming someone for plagiarism, make sure you can prove that there was a plagiarism. Writers can use online plagiarism checker, for example, Unplag https://unplag.com. If some visual content was stolen, make sure that it happened with tools, that are mentioned in the article, and then – take action! Artists consistently experience acts of imitating or “borrowing” their ideas. Be cool with it. If young artists try to imitate your style, it means that you’re the artistic genius, you start trends, you’re the boss. reply Megan says: August 12, 2014 at 4:53 pm I found this article very helpful! Thanks for posting :) reply Jean says: August 13, 2014 at 7:51 am Excellent ideas. Thank you! reply Celia says: August 13, 2014 at 12:02 pm EXCELLENT article, thank you!! reply PattiH says: August 14, 2014 at 9:19 am Great timing as I’m just getting my business off the ground. I’ll certainly make use of your suggestions! Thanks! reply Gabriel says: August 14, 2014 at 1:20 pm Great post thanks! A great free copyleaks alternative is a website called Copyleaks – http://www.copyleaks.com you can sign up for free and then scan your content automatically (even your entire website) for plagiarism. cheers, Gab reply Kiffanie says: August 21, 2014 at 4:55 pm Thanks for sharing Gab! Just tested it out and that site is great! I hadn’t heard of it before but I am adding it to my resources list. reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Design*Sponge reserves the right to restrict comments that do not contribute constructively to the conversation at hand, contain profanity, personal attacks, hate speech or seek to promote a personal or unrelated business.

Location sharing is going live in Google Maps for everyone Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/03/28 1:40pm PDTMar 28, 2017 100 Plus 1 on G+ 228 Share on Facebook 78 Share on Twitter Total Shares406 Applications Google News Google pulled the location sharing features from Google+ recently, which was annoying because the corresponding feature in Maps was not actually available yet. Well, it turns out Google was only a little behind schedule. Location sharing in Maps appears to be rolling out wide right now. Location sharing is accessible from the navigation drawer—it's currently marked with a "New" badge. When you fire it up, you can choose to share your location with anyone you pick for any length of time. You can even leave location sharing on indefinitely. Sharing is also accessible by tapping the blue location dot. However you do it, you need to set up sharing even if you had location sharing enabled via the old Google+ method.   When someone shares their location with you, they appear in the bar at the top of the map. Just tap there to see their location. At the bottom of the map you get location information and a handy toggle to share your location back. Plus, Maps has some new home screen shortcuts for seeing shared locations and sharing your own. Note, shared locations also appear in the main map interface, but you can hide them if you want. If you're sharing your location, you also get a new shortcut button to the share menu on the right side of the screen. It only appears when the map is centered on you, though. Location sharing has shown up for all the accounts we've checked. If it isn't appearing right away, restart the Maps app and look again.

Timbets Not in Finland yet Leo Herzog US Maps, beta app, not showing up for me. Cleared app data and cache, still no dice. Paul Same here Patryk Poland, beta app - it's there for me. Level 4 contributor. Leo Herzog I'm a level 4 contributor as well. Paul Dang, I'm only Level 3, that must be it... Leo Herzog No, I'm saying I'm a level 4, and I do *not* have the option yet. Paul Lol I know, I was only kidding anyways. I would hope our contributor level doesn't make a difference. I'm thinking it's more that we're in the beta and in the US if anything as to why we don't have it yet. Paul Mine is showing up now. Scros97 Here at Spain, phone language set to US, Maps beta level 4 and seeing it. Stevie_Wonder If you don't have it yet, go to Maps on the web (I think it has to be on a computer) and click on open on your phone. If it doesn't work, make sure that Maps is not running. johnforamerica Didn't work... Mike Row This worked for me. Jason Pagliaro Had to forcefully close maps through Settings > Apps but this seems to have worked. Adi-Karta Dasa Still not working after doing this in Colombia. Thanks. roberto.elena As @Jason Plagiaro said, a forced stop of the app does the trick. Adi-Karta Dasa Not here. Lars Jeppesen Works here - I'm in Brazil Total Insecurity Edit: I just tried the same on my other device. There it could get activated by signing out and in again. Then you need to press the new widget and it should appear. Maybe try deleting a your cache like I did before as well! I think I just found out how to activate the new share live location in Google Maps. All you need to do is: Go to widgets in Android, add and click on the share location widget​ That way I immediately got the new update! I hope it works for you as well! ﻿ johdaxx Totally worked thanks! Matt I've got it here in the UK UniBroW Showing up on google maps on iOS too UniBroW https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d5187816393a5b6b4668187fbc37199bb6c197e8ea5a8753c120ff0142a7e03b.png johnforamerica Yup, still waiting.. Nexus 6P on google maps beta ingrouille Figured out a way to force it. Go to the web version of Maps and see if it's there. Click the use the app link and then send it to your phone. You'll then be able to open the feature on your phone. Tylar Overturf I got it and using it with my friends. Doesn't seem to real time though. Still have to refresh it like you did in G+. Artem Russakovskii Should be relatively real-time in theory. Tylar Overturf Yea seems like for my friends and family on Android it refreshes a lot quicker. My friends and family with iPhones it takes a lot longer to refresh which I guess it to be expected. Tyler Swindell I was really excited to boycott Life360 because of it's problematic nature on my Pixel, and while nobody has left the house yet. It's stuck refreshing the location for one of the phones.. And when I try and manually refresh, it won't actually tell the phone to refresh. If this isn't any better than the fake real-time location sharing in Google+, screw this. I tried that one before and when somebody came to pick me up, I asked them if they had their phone and they handed it to me and here I was manually refreshing their location on Google+, and it just would say 20 minutes ago AFTER the refresh. Until I went into Google+ on their phone did it change. Oh I really hope this is better... If it doesn't catch on someone left the house and is on route, it's useless. tim242 Just like every other Google feature, it is half-assed and doesn't work properly. catalysto Very constructive feedback. Google will be happy to hear it. Total Insecurity It will be working properly, trust me :) Rod Please, elaborate. tim242 I added people to my share list. I set it for one hour. Then I look again, and it is toggled back off for that person. It also kept taking me through the setup process over and over. Rod Will try it out tomorrow and check that issue. Justin Fabian Am I missing the widget? It looks like all we get is a shortcut to a particular contact. Total Insecurity Widgets are also added :) Jay I am not able to see a map widget showing the contact's location in my phone. I see only a shortcut like how it is for @Justin Total Insecurity Try to delete the cache and force close Maps. Then open Maps again and check another time for the widget. demarcmj Screenshot? I don't see a widget and haven't heard anyone else mention a widget. The only thing I'm aware of are the shortcuts to a particular person and the "Share Location" one. miscfiles I've also got the update in the UK, but there's no shared location map widget, as there was with Google+. Julian Coronado I'm glad this feature is out to Maps. It reminds me of the location sharing on iOS in which you can select a friend's contact and see their location (if it's turned on for you to see). alex simon showing up here. version 9.42.9 Beta on pixel xl destinyhud what happens to contacts shared via google+? my wife shares her location with me but it no longer shows on my maps Peter They are gone. Need to set it up again in Maps. NathanDrago Can anyone tell me what the probable impact on battery life is? Is it like leaving the GPS always on? Michael Tran doesn't appear to be always on. If you're someone that already has location turned on all the time, then I imagine there is very little impact. If you're someone that has it disabled and would like to use this feature, then there will probably be more noticeable battery drain. So far the feature where you can ping someone for their location doesn't seem to be there. OR maybe that will be exclusive to trusted contacts app. Michael Rodgers I saw the option to Refresh a contact's location...similar to how it was in Google+. demarcmj That just refreshes it on your end... making sure your app has the freshest data available. It doesn't actually tell the other person's phone to get a fresh location. Rod Besides keeping your GPS active, it'll be uploading data the whole time. It's safe to assume it'll be a power-hungry functionality. Lars Jeppesen no Rod Until they come up with some sort of magic, that's how it will work. demarcmj That's not how it works. It works more or less the same as Loatitude/G+ Location Sharing... Your phone doesn't check location any more or less than it normally would. It just shares whatever your most recent location was. Obviously, if you're doing something on your phone that makes it constantly poll the GPS (like having Maps open or Navigating), it will drain battery, but that wouldn't be because of the sharing. Rod Sure about that? Because then, it won't really be "live" tracking. demarcmj Yes. It's as "live" as possible given the freshness of the other person's data. Rod What do you mean? It only notifies where the person is, instead of where he/she is passing through? demarcmj It shows you where the person was, the last time their phone updated it's location. Rod My bad. Thought it was real-time tracking. demarcmj You get the same old "x minutes ago" text next to the location. In this case, 44 minutes. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f5e2dcada74c3f215a7669dc51b689a0f1c5c5d5d01786940cbec86ee77022c9.jpg Rod I see. I thought it was live tracking. Trooper311 Cool. Not using it though. Arie It is now also available on Maps in the browser (desktop).. Red Click on it. It'll tell you to use the app on your phone. destinyhud when at location sharing in maps click on menu(3 dots on top right)-->settings-->disable location share seems to do nothing and it enables as soon as i get back. is that how it works for everyone or am i having issues? b_boogey_xl I saw this coming from a mile away... http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/03/28/google-disables-location-sharing-google-enabling-everyone-google-maps/ On the share location screen, for a second there I thought Google added "stories" to Maps. Laurent Sadly not for everyone. Still Google reserves some of its feature to some privileged humans of our world. YouNex Really ? What are the limitations Laurent Paid apps in the play store, Google location history (which is needed by many of their services), Pixel phones, and more. YouNex Why ? is location history not available for some people ? Laurent True. It says "not available in your country". As of the why, I never managed to get that answered. rndusrnm479461 Mostly being in the US. A LOT of their features are US exclusive. Amblin Have it on my device. Add my family. It sends an email to the contacts. Contacts click it and are told they need to update Maps. No update is available. Excellent way to roll this out Google. Excellent. ashjas read the last line of this article! Its a server side switch. Jennifercalvarez Google is paying 97$ per hour! Work for few hours & have longer with friends and family! !dy142c: On tuesday I got a great new Land Rover Range Rover from having earned $8752 this last four weeks..

Amblin Yes I know that. My point was it's a terrible user experience to notify people who can't even access the feature. A location share to someone should enable it. REFL3CTioN Pixel on VZW, running google maps, working fine. Enrique The new option appeared after cleaning cache. No new app update required. Jason Farrell Bah. I have a duplicate contact issue that Google's duplicates fixer can't fix. demarcmj So manually delete the duplicate. What does this have to do with Maps? Jason Farrell Deleting the dupe doesn't help. And it's relevant to the new Maps sharing since the dupe contacts stay in the top bar. demarcmj You're clearly doing something wrong Chronos90 Too sad location history gets activated too by this. Would love it if it's disabled again after sharing the position after a while. Don't like having location history activated all the time because it drains the battery :( Rod I thought so too, but I let it running for a couple weeks and didn't notice any difference. And I'm OCD and battery/RAM usage. demarcmj It doesn't drain the battery. Your phone is periodically checking location anyway. Location history just saves it every time it checks. Rod Just got it.. (Brazil) http://i.imgur.com/T13JaqD.png Ragnar Lodbrok Will it suck my data plan? Rod Yes Daniel Breslauer No. As another user mentioned, it uses perhaps 1 MB per day or so. The amount of data needed for this is exremely tiny. Vivek Rameses I love how people applaud this. Take my privacy! Stalkers rejoice, there favorite tool is now back. Darth Jar Jar I'm going to go stalk my wife. tehboogieman You authorize your stalkers to view your location? http://e.lvme.me/pzv5j7l.jpg Zak Taccardi are there battery implications to this? I'm concerned about the real time. Does that mean my phone will never go into a deep sleep? elko Its not real time. I set a link for 6 hours and maps shows only about 1MB used in background as well which is good as location updates really shouldn't take much. Battery usage was minimal or not really noticeable. My biggest problem is that actually using maps seems to have location problems for myself after activating that feature (or else it was a coincidence). Rod Of course. GPS + location upload running the whole time. demarcmj It's no more or less real-time than Latitude or G+ ever were. It just shares the persons most recent location, which could be 10, 20, 30, 40,.. minutes old if their phone hasn't updated it's location in a while. I've seen nothing to indicate that they are increasing the GPS poll rate when you enable this. My wife and I have had it on since it rolled out yesterday and I have checked periodically and seen times as high as "44 minutes ago" (even after refreshing to make sure it was not just on my end). Obviously, if you do the "navigation sharing" (or just open maps) it will be real-time. But that is to be expected. realtestman Yeah, it's weird cos it doesn't update in background, like Glympse. So it's simply using Location Services, which isn't good enough. I'll stick to Glympse. Cameron Plas My Pixel had it but my G3 didn't... Sharing from Pixel to G3 and then opening maps on G3 enabled it. Adrian Gab Brilliant. Just what I've wanted for years. I go MTB riding and want to be able to let loved ones know where I am in case a one a million occurs. Lawrence Who requested this? Daniel Breslauer Works for me, in the Netherlands - enabled it about 10 hours ago. I came across it by change when I wanted to switch to satellite mode. Very happy to see this. I was a user of Latitude back in 2009 or so already, which was the first attempt Google made at this. It was then retired and then came back in Google+ which I didn't like at all. Hope the new iteration is the real deal. Now that it's been added as an official mainstream part of Maps, I'm pretty certain it's there to stay. Blusole You can also share your ETA when you are navigating in google maps https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fcaebb2755fcb70f5c076de420a586f5495fd403b34bf1c4990478b4f380ab17.jpg demarcmj That was covered in the initial article. Blusole Yes, you can say this to the whole article. All covered in the initial article... Elemetrix Got the feature but doesn't seem to work, friend tried it too. Just get the message "this person is no longer sharing their location" Marcus Bennett So I use Google Locations (within G+) all the time. Of course I have seen the announcments about it being on Google Maps. Today the G+ locations button says : goto Google Maps. And in Google Maps. NOTHING. For me here in Switzerland, NO LOCATION SHARING. What a cock up. Casper Pascal I have that on web, but not on my phone. So annoying because I use that frequently everyday Jhelum Sen Brilliant initiative taken by Google! I learned about this new feature from Techmagnate blog. They clearly explained how this Real-Time Sharing Feature Works in their recent post: http://www.techmagnate.com/blog/google-map-live-location-share-real-time-location/ But to know the real cause of this feature I land up to Google's own blog: https://blog.google/products/maps/share-your-trips-and-real-time-location-google-maps/. They elaborated that this feature is an answer to "where are you?” This can be a safety measure taken by Google or it can prove to be a trap for some people ;) Follow Android Police 1.5M 464k 141k 104k Latest Deals 21 [Deal Alert] Grab these free and 10-cent apps, games, and icon packs 2017/04/05 6:44am PDTApr 5, 2017 20 [Deal Alert] The Moto G4 Plus is $189.99 ($60 off) on Amazon 2017/04/04 2:26pm PDTApr 4, 2017 15 [Deal Alert] Amazon is discounting unlocked phones from Sony, LeEco, Lenovo, and more by up to $125 2017/04/04 12:33pm PDTApr 4, 2017 0 [Deal Alert] Amazon has a 2-node Netgear Orbi Home WiFi system and an Echo Dot bundle for $330 ($91 off) 2017/04/04 12:00pm PDTApr 4, 2017 15 [Deal Alert] Save $5.50 on a dual-coil fast charging wireless stand from CHOETECH with our exclusive coupon code ($16.50 after coupon) 2017/04/04 10:38am PDTApr 4, 2017 Latest Poll How often do you use virtual reality products (that you own)?
