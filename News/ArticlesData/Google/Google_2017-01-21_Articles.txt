A new rumor out of both companies' home country of South Korea now claims that LG has done something that's pretty surprising in the Android world. Instead of building its own sub-par virtual assistant, LG has apparently turned to Google for help. As such, the G6 will come with the Google Assistant built-in. Previously, the Google Assistant was exclusive to Google's own Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones (at least in the form that's integrated into the Android system, since it also lives in the Allo chat app and the Google Home device). The Google Assistant is also an integral part of the upcoming Android Wear 2.0 release, which will be running on the LG Watch Sport and Watch Style, the first wearables to have the new OS version on board. These were co-developed with Google in a program not dissimilar to what the Nexus line used to be for smartphones. The two smartwatches will be unveiled on February 9, it's been rumored. The LG G6 will be made official on February 26 at MWC in Barcelona. It's reportedly going to become available in early March, beating the Galaxy S8 to the market by about a month.

By: Chakri Kudikala Published: Saturday, January 21, 2017, 10:30 [IST] There are plenty of rumors coming out every day regarding the upcoming flagship LG G6 and today's leak say that the phone will come with Google Assistant built-in. Rumors say that LG has approached the search giant, Google to request them to include the Pixel-exclusive Google Assistant on their upcoming flagship phone. But, there are no details on whether Google has agreed to this or not. Also Read: Xiaomi Mi Notebook Air 2 could be lighter than a Kg; new details revealed Because LG previously worked with Google to manufacture Nexus phones, the response from Google might be a positive one. Incidentally, LG is the one releasing two new Smartwatches with Android Wear 2.0 on February 9. However, if Google denies LG to include the Google Assistant on their phones, the South Korean giant has another plan as well. It was rumored that LG would approach Amazon, another leader in AI technology to integrate their tech in the LG G6. But, there's no final response for now from Google. If Google ever accepts this LG's proposal, then the LG G6 will be the world's first non-Pixel phone to get Google Assistant.

We’re not sure how long the exclusivity will run for, but it seems that it could be ending with the launch of the LG G6. According to the latest rumors, it seems that Google Assistant could be one of the LG G6’s features. This is an interesting choice considering that both LG and Samsung have shadowed each other’s footsteps when it comes to smartphones (Samsung Galaxy Round VS the LG G Flex; Galaxy Note with S Pen VS LG G4 Stylus, just to name a few), and with Samsung rumored to launch its own voice assistant AI Bixby, we’re sure some would have thought LG would have followed suit. However we guess going with Google Assisant might not be such a bad idea, especially since it is probably better integrated into Android compared to other voice assistants. Of course this is just a rumor for now so take it with a grain of salt. So far what we know about the LG G6 includes its 5.7-inch QHD+ 18:9 display, and also how LG is killing off the modular features of the LG G5 and that for the LG G6, the handset will be a more “normal” looking device. LG has also recently confirmed their presence at MWC 2017 where they are expected to host a press conference on the 26th of February, 2017, so check back with us then for the details and to see if Google Assistant will indeed be a feature of the handset.

Taking a look at how Google does this for YouTube can provide inspiration and set a framework for analytics solutions. ByGeorge Anadiotis for Big on Data | January 20, 2017 -- 16:28 GMT (08:28 PST) | Topic: Big Data Analytics YouTube recommendations are a prominent example of applying advanced analytics on a massive scale to improve a service, the experience users get out of it, and the bottom line of the vendor behind it -- Google. Previously, we explored the rationale behind it and pondered as to how this type of analytics could be classified. It's time to pick up where we left off and explore how it works under the hood. Inspiration came from a hit moment for YouTube recommendations: one of those times when it succeeded in picking up the track that the person curating an ad-hoc, spur-of-the-moment playlist was about to play next. The wow effect induced by this successful prediction/recommendation of a rarity, triggered a spur-of-the-moment discussion which may serve to illuminate different aspects of analytics. So, how could YouTube know what you want to play next before you play it? Data: has(h) functions, will preserve similarity special feature IoT: The Security Challenge The Internet of Things is creating serious new security risks. We examine the possibilities and the dangers. Read More One take at this would be to find a way to rank the degree to which videos are similar to each other based on their content. Strange as it may sound, this scenario is plausible. A typical application is ranking documents as to their similarity based on hashes of their content. This approach is based on a technique called Locality Preserving Hashing (LPH). LPH's premise sounds simple: it relies on using a hash function to map content to an identifier, in such a way that similar content will result in similar identifiers. A hash is a function applied to any data input that generates an output based on the input it receives. The most obvious example and common application of hash functions is using them to organize textual input in buckets. LPH is about finding and using hash functions that preserve locality, meaning that they map similar input to similar output. A simple example would be to apply LPH to documents. When dealing with documents, applying a hash function is more intuitive as the input is a string representing the entire content of the document and the output is another string representing a mapping of the input as per the hash function. A naive hash function H(input) -> output could use a numeric value corresponding to each character in the input to generate an output. If we define a hash function H that works by mapping each character in its input to its order in the alphabet and concatenating output, then H("ab") -> 12. Of course, reality is more complicated than that. Our naive H function cannot be used to rank documents as to their similarity, because it lacks the locality preserving property: it does not map similar input to similar output, at least not in the way we would intuitively define similarity. For example H("hello world") -> 851212150231518124, H("world hello") -> 231518124085121215, H("hello buddy") -> 8512121502214425. If we use the difference between the numeric value of generated hash outputs as a (equally naive) metric for similarity, we'll end up concluding that "hello world" is closer to "hello buddy" than it is to "world hello". This goes to show that definition of similarity, as expressed in this case by hashing, is both hard and context-dependent. For textual data, there are other techniques that can be used to determine similarity, as well as more advanced flavors of hashing. For multimedia content like video, things are even more complicated as hashing becomes less obvious and the locality preserving property is even harder to achieve. Case in point though, hashing multimedia content works fine for Shazam, the well-known music service that can identify tracks by giving it audio clips as input. Shazam works by generating hashes ("fingerprints") of the audio clips it receives and comparing them against a database of fingerprints generated from the list of tracks it works with. Granted, identity and similarity are not the same thing, which is why applying LPH to multimedia content is hard, but apparently possible. Whether this technique is actually used by Google in YouTube is not known at this point, but the fact that a body of published research on the topic from the likes of IBM does exist makes this a conceivable notion. The takeaway from this superficial analysis however is that regardless of what the data at hand or the techniques used, leveraging inherent features of the data that an analytics solution works with is a valid method for building such a solution. Metadata: is it enough, is it descriptive, is it descriptive enough? Metadata is additional data describing the data that an analytics solution works with. In the case of YouTube videos, we have metadata such as video title, description, tags and annotations, category, date and place the video was captured, and uploader identity. Some of that metadata like uploader and upload date are generated automatically, but most are supplied by uploaders themselves. That metadata also has differences in its nature and use. Depending on the point of view, metadata can be classified according to different taxonomies, but for our purposes we'll go with Getty's classification. According to Getty, metadata can be classified as Administrative, Descriptive, Preservation, Technical, and Use metadata. Getty's classification is the most complete one, as it stems from the cultural heritage world, one of professional content administrators. YouTube on the other hand exemplifies a common property of many of today's data-intensive applications: the nature of its data flows makes manual management of its metadata impractical and/or non sustainable. YouTube deals with this challenge by crowdsourcing parts of its metadata management and automating others. While presumably all available YouTube metadata are used for analytics, a big part of its administrative and descriptive metadata generation is crowdsourced, while other types of medatata are mostly handled by means of automated extraction. As Google engineers point out, not all features are created equal, so some metadata is of more importance, and descriptive metadata is among those. But what if each and every YouTube video was annotated with perfect metadata -- would that ramp up the effectiveness of recommendations? Are not even a few ratings more valuable than metadata? YouTube video metadata is incomplete and poorly structured, which makes this a hypothetical question. Still, we can once more turn to Google to answer it. Google relies on KnowledgeGraph to power its famous search engine. KnowledgeGraph features carefully curated descriptive metadata about a wide array of topics to power semantic search, resulting in the most powerful massively deployed search engine in the world. KnowledgeGraph is what YouTube metadata is missing: an ontology. Ontologies express semantics in a precise way, and are on the far end of a scale of semantics constructs that also includes lexicons, taxonomies, and schemas. Ontologies can be used to state relationships such as inheritance, synonym-antonym, and every other conceivable relationship its curators wish to define. That means that a big part of what happens with any information retrieval request depends on ontological definitions. For example, whether track A, classified in genre X, is similar to track B, classified in genre Y, depends to an extent on whether genres X and Y have been marked as having some sort of relationship between them. So if semantics are so great, why doesn't Google use them for YouTube? Curating an ontology, or even something simpler like a vocabulary or a schema, is no easy feat. Google already does this however, so it could just reuse KnowledgeGraph for YouTube. But even with a ready-made ontology at hand, using it to annotate data is also hard. In the case of semantic search, the gigantic corpus of web documents is automatically annotated by means of Google's indexing engine. The engine uses an array of techniques to extract the most relevant keywords out of documents and uses them to annotate each document. Using manual annotation to deal with the volume of data being added to the web daily would be sheer folly, and same goes for YouTube content. Some metadata, however, is better than no metadata, which is why Google crowdsources the annotation of YouTube videos using a very simple schema plus some free text user-generated descriptions. Annotating data is not trivial and requires familiarity with the vocabulary used, which may partially explain why an ontology for annotating YouTube content is not available to its users. Soon algorithmic solutions may be see the world like humans do and thus used to generate descriptive metadata for YouTube content in a way similar to how this works for text documents, and it will be interesting to see the effect on YouTube analytics. Machine Learning: connecting the dots Machine Learning is all about identifying patterns in data -- but is it really entirely data and metadata agnostic? So if using inherent data properties is hard and using metadata does not scale, is using machine learning (ML) easy? ML is at the core of Google's approach to YouTube analytics. In fact, not just any ML, but deep learning (DL), a branch of ML that is seeing both great advances and hype. Although ML is being increasingly adopted and discussed, DL may deserve analysis on its own. Still, for all intents and purposes, DL is ML. Google is one of the leaders in DL, having recently open-sourced TensorFlow, a DL library and API based on the GoogleBrain project. And the fact that Google manages to apply DL in YouTube analytics to deal with the related challenges of scale, freshness, and noise is quite an achievement. But even the most advanced of ML applications does not come without its own set of challenges. YouTube analytics is framed by Google engineers as a collaborative filtering problem. In collaborative filtering, recommendations for content are delivered to users based on their similarity to other users. "The underlying assumption of the collaborative filtering approach is that if a person A has the same opinion as a person B on an issue, A is more likely to have B's opinion on a different issue x than to have the opinion on x of a person chosen randomly." For example, it should not matter whether fish and bicycle have some relationship as concepts in the real world and whether that relationship is captured by an ontology or a LPH hash function. As long as there are users that for some reason tend to watch videos with fish and videos with bicycles, and those users are deemed similar to you, watching a fish video is likely to bring a bicycle video as a suggestion to be played next. ML is about finding patterns in data. In theory, what that data and the associated metadata is bears no significance to identifying patterns. Which is why ML matches well with the collaborative filtering problem. And that's part of the beauty of ML too: not having to model all possible relations in the real world. After all, who can possibly know it all and who can possibly predict that some day for some reason people will start associating fish with bicycles? In practice however, knowing the data and metadata for a domain ML is to be applied in matters a great deal. Remember Oren Etzioni's statement -- "ML is 99 percent human work." And as per Google's engineers, "despite the promise of DL to alleviate the burden of engineering features by hand, the nature of our raw data does not easily lend itself to be input directly into feed-forward neural networks. We still expend considerable engineering resources transforming user and video data into useful features." Google's engineers also expand considerable intelligence in choosing what algorithms they should use and what features (metadata!) to incorporate, training their model, and applying all sorts of reported and non-reported heuristics in their DL-powered engine. Which brings us to the key point. In the mix: the human in the data loop Creating a winning analytics solutions means mixing and matching every available approach applicable to the domain. Image: Paco Nathan Analytics used to be simple. When talking about analytics, the implicit assumption was that we would be referring to descriptive analytics, or what is now called rear-view mirror analytics: what has already happened, which seems to be relatively easy to keep track of and present. Business intelligence, OLAP, reports, bar charts, and dashboards. Who really owns your Internet of Things data? In a world where more and more objects are coming online and vendors are getting involved in the supply chain, how can you keep track of what's yours and what's not? Read More Analytics has now expanded to include scenarios that go way beyond previous definitions and capabilities. The explosion in the volume of data, in the techniques and means to store and process them, and the realization of the benefits this can accrue has led to analytics applications that border on artificial intelligence -- a topic in and by itself. We have used a well-known, advanced example of analytics to outline a framework for examining analytics solutions: mix and match analytics. We chose YouTube as an example of a service everyone is familiar with, featuring rich and extensive data and metadata, and powered by a vendor with advanced technology and resources and far-reaching ambition. Google has published enough about its approach to allow for certainty and speculation in healthy doses. Google is not dogmatic in its approach, and neither are other experts in the field. Xavier Amatriain is VP of engineering at Quora and was previously heavily involved in Netflix Prize, a challenge very similar in nature. Back in 2009, before ML started enjoying the kind of widespread popularity it does today, Amatriain pointed towards the fact that mixing the use of data and metadata with patterns observed in their use can lead to better results. In the end, you could say it becomes a sort of philosophical question, with two schools of thought: curation versus emergence, rationalism versus empiricism. Cognitive science does not offer definitive answers there, AI does not either, and neither could we. But if there is one takeaway point from this brief journey into advanced analytics, it would be that mixing and matching may lead to better results than dogmatic approaches. So no matter what advanced tools and techniques we may have in our arsenal, the human in the loop will continue to play a key role in the foreseeable future. This simple mix-and-match framework may offer a lens to examine other analytics solutions as well, and we will be using it for this purpose.

With it, you can control your smart home devices, cue up a movie on your TV, replace your desktop speakers, and more. To get the most out of your Goole Home, you really need to do a deep-dive into the Home app or just play around the device for a while. Luckily for you, we've done both, and we've rounded up a selection of the top tips and tricks to help you master the voice-activated speaker in no time. Google Home review: Better than Amazon Echo? Google Home Assistant tips and tricks Pocket-lint Google Assistant is Google's iteration of a personal assistant. It's considered an upgrade or an extension of Google Now, as well as an expansion of Google's existing "OK Google" voice controls. It's conversational, too. You can ask a question and follow-up questions, and Assistant will track the conversation, determine context, and audibly respond with the right information. Google Assistant is a stand-out feature in the Google Home speaker. You can use it to control Google Home, Pixel devices, as well as third-party services and devices. To help you figure out everything Assistant can do, we've rounded up some tips and tricks, which you can find here. However, if you want to learn tips and tricks unique, exclusive or specific to Google Home, read on. What is Google Assistant, how does it work, and when can you use it? Google Home tips and tricks Pocket-lint Remember to use a wake word Google Assistant responds to two 'wake words': "Ok Google" and "Hey Google". Unfortunately, you can't change it from these two phrases. Also, you need to say one every single time you wish to engage with Google Home (say the phrase, followed by a question or command). Adjust settings and preferences In the Google Home app, slide out the menu drawer from the left side of the screen, and tap on More Settings. If you want, you can tap your name after selecting More Settings and add your home address for specific weather and traffic reports. Also, from the Personal info menu in settings, you can set a nickname that Assistant will use for you. Under Preferences, you can choose a preferred temperature unit. In the News and My Day sections, you pick various news sources, while with My Day you can select which details are included when you prompt Google Home to tell you about your day. Examples include weather, commute time, reminders, etc. Another way you can get to settings: Open the hamburger menu (the three lines in the upper corner) and look for the Devices option. You'll see your Google Home listed. From there, open its menu by tapping the three dots in the upper left corner and choose Settings. Everything you need to adjust or change about you're Google Home is there. Give Google Home a new name Under settings, go to Name, and from there, you can rename your Google Home whenever and how often you like. Connect third-party services Google Home relies on third-party services to provide you with a richer experience. Think of these services as apps that you can access on the speaker. At launch, Google Home’s services were limited to Uber. Now, the full list of services ranges from WebMD to an animal quiz. To find a full list of supported services, open More Settings > Services. From there, tap on the service you want to connect to your Google Home. Keep in mind Google Home doesn't hold a candle to Amazon Alexa in terms of connected apps - not yet anyway. But it does play well with Pandora, TuneIn, Google Music, Spotify, YouTube, and even Netflix and Uber. You can also use it to control smart home products from Nest, Philips Hue lights, and Smart Things. It also supports Cast, so you can use it in conjunction with Chromecast to send content to your TV. Use the Google ecosystem To get the most out of Google Home, use Google’s other products. It's designed to work with products many people frequently use, such as Google Calendar and Google Keep. When combined with Google Home, you can make Assistant a true personal assistant. It can check your schedule, set reminders, add items to your shopping lists, and more -- and all with a simple voice command. Reset Google Home To conduct a factory reset and restore your Google to a good-as-new state, hold the microphone button for about 15 seconds. From there, you can link it to a different Google account using the Google Home app. Remember, it doesn't allow you to set up multiple user profiles. Reboot Google Home What do you do when some gadget stops working? You restart it, or "reboot" it. So, of course Google included this in the Home app. Just open the Home app and then select Devices > Menu > Reboot. That's it. Touch your way through things Aside from your voice, you can control Google Home with your touch. Tap the top of the speaker once to awaken your Google Home or to pause and play a broadcast. You can also slide your finger along the centered circle at the top to change volume. Mute the mic If you want to stop Google Home from "always-listening", look for the button on the back of the speaker. It's the only button, and it has a microphone on it. Press it and Home will turn off the microphone (four amber lights will light up on top). Press it again, and it'll tell you the microphone is on. When it's on, Google Home is in the always-listening mode and will listen for and respond to your commands. You can Google that Google Home is basically Google.com. Want to find a grocery store in Sacramento? Need to convert ounces to cups? Curious how old Donald Trump is? Ever wonder what the capital of Florida is? Google Home can be your assistant and set an appointments, but it also doubles as a search engine. Remember, you can also ask follow-up questions. Google Assistant will always remember the topic or subject in your string of questions. Check your activity Under More Settings, scroll to the bottom and tap the My Activity option. A website will open with everything Google Home (and Assistant on your phone) has recorded. You can sort by date and time, play back exactly what Home heard, get details, and delete them. Set up Guest Mode You can set up a guest mode to let anyone connect to your Google Home once they enter a four-digit PIN provided by the app. Cast movies or audio to a TV If you have a Chromecast device, go to More Settings in the Google Home app, tap on TVs and Speakers, and then tap the plus sign in the bottom right corner of the screen. The Google Home app will search for voice-supported TVs on the same Wi-Fi network as your Google Home. From there, you can ask Google Home to play Netflix movies and TV show or even YouTube videos. You must connect third-party services -- like Netflix -- to your Google account using the Google Home app (Settings > More Settings > Videos and Photos). After doing this, you can simply say things like “Okay Google, play House of Cars from Netflix on TV". You can even also Google Home to pause playback or rewind a minute to something you might've missed. Cast photos to your TV Google Home can’t just control Netflix or YouTube on your TV, it can also control Google Photos, Google's free cloud photo storage service. Just link up your account in the Google Home app under settings, and then say “Okay Google, show me photos of my pets on TV”. The service is able to tag and recognise people, things, and places, so it's able to smartly serve up whatever you ask for. Ditch your desktop speakers Google Cast is built directly into the Chrome browser. So, when you click the cast button in the corner of Chrome, you can look for your Home device, select it, and then cast audio from your computer to/through Google Home. Set your music source Google Home can play music from several sources, such as Play Music, Pandora, Spotify or YouTube Music. To set your default source, head got to More Settings in the Home app, then choose Music (or choose Music from the sidebar), and link an account and select it as the main source Manage a family shopping list You can automatically add things to your shopping list, which means it'll be added to a note in the Google Keep app for iOS or Android, just by saying something like: “Okay Google, add coffee to my shopping list”. The list can only be associated with the primary account holder. You can add collaborators to this list so they can access it though; simply select the three-dots button in the right corner of the list, select “collaborator,” and invite other family members to the list. Play podcasts All you have to do to hear podcasts is ask. Say “Okay Google, Play This American Life” to hear the most recent episode of the show. If you should pause it, the next time you ask for that podcast, Google Home will pick up where you left off. Find your misplaced phone Can't find your home? Google Home can locate the device -- if you link it with a service called IFTTT. Use this recipe (requires an IFTTT account) so that you can automatically call your number when you say “Okay Google, find my phone.” Turn off the lights Google Home can control internet-connected appliances around your home, such as lightbulbs like Philips Hue. You can not only turn those on and off, but also say things like “Okay Google, turn the living room purple" to change their colour. But Google Home is a voice-controlled hub for all your smart devices. You can also leverage IFTTT recipes to get the most out of Home and your devices, but that's not required. Set an alarm This might seem obvious but... Google Home can replace your alarm clock. Say “OK Google, set an alarm for 5 minutes” or whenever, and you'll hear a nice tune and see a circle of lights on the top of Google Home when the alarm goes off. Hear about your day You can ask Google Home “tell me about my day” to get an audio report of your calendar, your morning traffic commute, the weather, and any reminders. You can also customise your report to exclude certain things, such as the weather. At the end, you'll get a news briefing. But first, to do any of this, you’ll must connect services like your Google Calendar using settings in the Google Home app. Google Home Easter eggs Pocket-lint Looking for some fun things to do with Google Home? While these are technically Google Assistant easter eggs, you'll find that they really give your Google Home some personality: Say "I'm feeling lucky" to start up a multiplayer game show. Say "Give me a random number between (x) and (y)" to hear a random number between the two - with beeping sounds to boot. Ask it to "Roll (insert number)-sided dice": It'll give you a random number, complete with sound effects. Say "(Contact name) is my (relationship)" to ask Assistant to associate certain relationship information with a contact for future reference. Say "Good morning" to hear a rundown of your day's agenda, along with the current weather and news. Say "Send a message to (Contact name) on (messaging service like WhatsApp)" to dictate a message to a contact. Say "Wubba lubba dub dub" to get Assistant to respond with: "Are you in pain? How can I help?" or "Sorry, I don't speak Birdperson" (a reference to the show Rick and Morty). Say "Beatbox" to hear a clip of someone beat-boxing. Say "sing a song" to hear a horrible, brief song. Say "Read a poem" to hear a random poem from Google search. Say "Tell me a joke" to hear an age-appropriate joke from Pixar. Say "F*** you" to submit a bug report.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Galaxy S8’s best feature might have its own dedicated button Yoni Heisler BGR NewsJanuary 21, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Looking to lessen its reliance on Google and further differentiate itself among a crowded field of Android handsets, Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy S8 smartphone will feature a brand new intelligent personal assistant, similar in nature to Siri on the iPhone. Don't Miss: You won’t believe how much Amazon is charging for Google’s Pixel XL Dubbed Bixby, Samsung’s AI assistant will be based on technology the company picked up when it acquired Viv this past October. What makes the forthcoming release of Bixby so intriguing is that Viv’s AI software was designed to answer layered questions that competing AI services are either unable to answer or struggle to process. For instance, Viv CEO Dag Kittlaus — who we should note helped develop Siri — explained that Viv can answer complex queries like, “Find me a flight to Dallas with a seat that Shaq could fit in.” While it remains to be seen just how extensive Bixby’s feature set will be once the Galaxy S8 hits store shelves, expectations are rather high. Indeed, we’ve already seen reports that Bixby will allow users to use voice commands to send money to friends and family. And just yesterday, word emerged that Bixby will be tightly integrated into the S8 camera and will be able to process text via OCR and even search for and identify objects. The most recent rumor involving Bixby centers on how users might call the feature into action. According to newly surfaced Galaxy S8 case renders , it appears that the Galaxy S8 may come with a fourth physical button. This had led some to speculate that this mysterious fourth button might be used as a way for users to quickly activate Bixby. As for other specs worth noting, the Galaxy S8 will likely feature an edgeless display, improved camera technology, 32GB of storage (with a 256GB model available), and an improved Super AMOLED display. Underneath the hood, the S8 will likely be powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 S0C. There have also been rumors, however doubtful, that the device will come packed with 6GB of RAM.

If Android applications continue to be the most targeted by attackers because of the software flaws they contain, It won't be a lack of effort on Google’s part to help developers make their products more secure. A case in point is the company's Google Play App Security Improvement (ASI) program designed to help developers protect their products against common threats. Since last May alone, the tips and recommendations provided by the service helped some 90,000 developers identify and fix security issues in more than 250,000 Android applications, Android security program manager Rahul Mishra said in a blog update this week. ASI currently provides guidance for Android developers on 26 new security issues they need to consider before uploading their apps to Google Play. That’s more than double the 11 security issues the company used to watch out for in third-party Android apps as recently as last May. Google has also set up a new page that consolidates information on all 26 identified security issues in one page. The page contains links directing developers to the appropriate security resources for each issue and contact information for those who need additional support. Developers can use the page to identify all of the issues in their applications that Google will likely flag as being problematic from a security standpoint when the apps are uploaded to Google Play. Under the ASI program, Google notifies developers immediately of any security issue that is identified so the problem can be remedied quickly. The alerts are sent directly to the developers via email and posted on their Google Play console along with information on how to address the problem. Along with the notification, Google also sets a deadline by which developers are expected to address the identified issue if they want their application to be uploaded to Google Play or if they want to make updates to it. "Developers can use this page as a resource to learn about new issues and keep track of all past issues," Mishra noted in his blog. The ASI program is one of several measures that Google has taken in recent years to try and shore up the security of its Android ecosystem. In recent years, the number of vulnerabilities discovered in Android applications has grown exponentially, though few of them have so far been exploited in a major way. In 2016, Android with 523 flaws, had more reported vulnerabilities in it than any other operating system, according to MITRE Corp. The second was Debian Linux with 327. The all time leader for the most number of reported vulnerabilities, however, is the macOS, which has accumulated over 1,670 flaws in the past several years. In response to the trend, Google has made several resources available to developers, beside ASI, to help identify and fix problems in their apps. Among them are an application sandbox, several vulnerability testing tools and fuzzers and security application programming interfaces in Google Play Services.           LATEST MOBILE ARTICLES   Samsung Reveals Cause of Galaxy Note7 Battery Fires, Explosions Google Voice Telephony Service Gets First Update in 5 Years More Than 250,000 Android Apps Updated Through Google's ASI Program New Apple iPad Pro, Microsoft Surface Pro Likely to Appear in March Google to Acquire Twitter’s Mobile App Development Platform                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows Google Open Sources Data Visualization Tool for Machine Learning Cisco Security Business Group Continues to Accelerate Growth Amazon Go Won't Kill Many Jobs, But It May Prove a Boon to Crooks Microsoft, Harman Kardon to Take on Amazon Echo, Google Home Yahoo Suffers New Hack; 1 Billion Users Impacted This Time 10 Things T-Mobile Has Done to Move O...

However, setting up your phone’s hotspot tends to be a little tedious. Google is addressing this issue with its new Android-only feature that’s coming first to Nexus and Pixel devices. According to Android Police, Google is rolling out Google Play Services 10.2, a software update that comes with a feature called Instant Tethering. Based on its name alone, it’s pretty clear that this feature provides Android users with a means to instantly launch the tethering functionality of their phones. And that’s what it really does. When a device needs WiFi connection, one does not need to unlock his or her phone and do the necessary steps to the mobile hotspot. The device can just connect to a phone via Bluetooth and instantly set up WIFI without going to Settings. If the phone’s Bluetooth is already turned on, there wouldn’t be a need to unlock it at all. Related Stories Google Struggles With Pixel, Pixel XL Supply 2017 iPads Slated For Launch In Second Half Google To Release Budget Android Smartphones In U.S. The Verge reports that this feature is similar to what Apple did to its Mac and iPhones. Mac users do not need to open their iPhone and manually setup the device to launch tethering. From the Mac, one can directly have access to the internet by launching the mobile hotspot of the iPhone. There’s a WiFi icon in the menu bar of Mac devices that connects and controls the iPhone’s mobile tethering switch When it comes to Google’s Instant Tethering, only devices with a single Google account can connect and instantly access tethering from each other. Thus, an Android tablet that needs internet access can only connect and launch a phone’s tethering functionality if the latter is logged on to the same Google account. Instant Tethering is reportedly rolling out for Nexus and Pixel devices with Android Nougat 7.1.1 OS first before coming to many other Android-running devices. The feature is currently being tested for other devices. Once testing is over, its availability could widen.

Some Android users have gotten a new feature called Instant Tethering with Google Play Services 10.2. This feature will link together devices that are tied to your Google account and make it easy to create a mobile hotspot with one device (like a phone) that you can connect to with another device (like a tablet). When enabled, a device will seek out other devices connected to your Google account that also have a cellular data connection and then connect to them. You’ll also be able to see the charge level of your hotspot device’s battery. This is a pretty nifty feature, as it can help save you time by not having to jump into Wi-Fi, seek out your phone’s mobile hotspot, enter a password, and so on. Unfortunately, the feature is currently only rolling out to Pixel and Nexus devices on Android 7.1.1. According to a Googler speaking to Android Police, though, the feature will become available on additional devices after more testing is completed. To check if you’ve got Instant Tethering, go into Settings and go into the Google section. Here’s to hoping that Instant Tethering rolls out to more Android users in a timely manner.

Now a new report says that LG will have another special Google feature for the G6’s launch. The LG G6 will include the Google Assistant, according to sources speaking to Business Korea. The only smartphones that currently offer Google’s Assistant are the Google Pixel and Pixel XL. Assistant is Google’s new and improved AI assistant, offering features like the ability to answer your questions, set reminders, make reservations, and more.  While the LG G6 won’t have the modular feature found on the G5, it’s shaping up to have some special features of its own. LG has already confirmed that the G6 will have a display with an 18:9 aspect ratio, which would make it a bit taller than most smartphone displays that are 16:9, and now it’s rumored that the G6 could include Google Assistant, too. While that may not be enough to sell the G6 on its own, it would be a pretty nice addition to the G6’s feature set. Have you tried Google Assistant yet?

However sometimes setting up a WiFi hotspot can be a bit finicky but not to worry as Google seems to have a solution. As discovered by the folks at Android Police, it seems that with Google Play Services 10.2, Google has introduced a new feature called “Instant tethering” to Android. So what is this feature about? Basically it will attempt to link up devices that are associated with your Google account, like if you have a Chromebook, an Android smartphone (or smartphones), or a tablet. So when a connection drops for one device, it will ask if you want to tether to your other devices instead without any additional setup required as it will rely on Bluetooth for the connection. We guess the idea is that you’ll be able to seamlessly continue doing your work or using your internet without having to go through the fuss of setting up the tether again. That being said, Android Police notes that this is a server side enabled feature so even if you have Google Play Services 10.2, you might not necessarily see it. Also they point out that the feature is being enabled on Nexus and Pixel devices running on Android 7.1.1 Nougat, so perhaps that’s a requirement as well. Filed in Cellphones.

Google is hoping to fix that, however, and will roll out a new feature in Google Play Services 10.2 that’s designed to make tethering much easier. The feature itself is called “Instant Tethering,” and as the name suggests, it basically links up devices connected to your Google account, making it easier to stay online if your wireless connection drops. In other words, if one of your connected devices loses its connection, it can ask you proactively if you want to tether your device, and you can do so without the need for any extra setup. That connection also extends beyond the internet — you’ll also be able check the battery life of your other devices. More: T-Mobile offers HD video day passes and One Plus plan with 4G tethering The feature seems helpful, but according to a report from Android Police, there’s also a server-side component to it, which means it might be a while before some people start seeing the feature. In other words, just because you have Google Play Services 10.2, that doesn’t mean that you have Instant Tethering — Google might need to enable the feature on its side. There also might be device limitations, and you won’t be able to tether if your carrier doesn’t allow it. Also according to the report, the feature will first roll out to Pixel and Nexus devices, and the Nexus 9 and Pixel C will be supported as clients — or devices that can tether. Instant Tethering will work on Android Marshmallow, and phones will be able to tether with each other. We expect that Instant Tethering will be available on more devices as time goes on, but we don’t have official confirmation on that just yet.

The page “President Obama and the LGBT Community | The White House,” which was dated April 27, 2015, now returns a 404 error code on the White House website. Instead of speaking of President Obama’s vision for “greater equality for LGBT Americans,” WhiteHouse.gov says, “Sorry, the page you’re looking for can’t be found.” The newly-revamped WhiteHouse.gov captures the email addresses of the people that choose to provide that information to the official White House website in order to receive updates from President Trump. Despite the uproar over things missing from WhiteHouse.gov, like civil rights, LGBT rights, and climate change pages, as reported by the Daily Beast, visitors might not need to panic. According to Snopes, certain pages specifically related to President Obama were transitioned to an archived part of the White House website, ObamaWhiteHouse.archives.gov. According to Google, that President Obama White House website archive currently has about 1,880 results. An incredible moment in American history — President Donald J. Trump taking the oath of office. A photo posted by The White House (@whitehouse) on Jan 20, 2017 at 11:50am PST Therefore, there’s no need to freak out that pages like “President Obama and the Hispanic Community | The White House,” which spoke of President Obama engaging the community are gone from the main White House’s website. The fact that the “Office of Inspector General, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services” page no longer resides where it used to in some links as searchable by Google will likely change as new pages appear on the White House website. Indeed, it can appear scary that pages that spoke of the Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP), which helped “improve the health of low-income elderly persons at least 60 years of age” no longer reside where they once did on WhiteHouse.gov. What’s more interesting is a search for the more recent pages of Trump’s White House website that Google has crawled in the past 24 hours. Those include pages that mention President Trump, such as “Standing Up For Our Law Enforcement Community” — a WhiteHouse.gov page that speaks of the Trump Administration being committed to standing up against violent crime and making the country more comfortable for children walking home from school, and not more comfortable for rioters, looters and violent disrupters. Other new WhiteHouse.gov pages show President Trump’s Inaugural Address and Mr. Trump’s so-dubbed energy plan on the page titled “An America First Energy Plan.” There’s also Trump’s “America First Foreign Policy” new page on the White House website, which speaks about defeating ISIS, attacking cyber warfare, and President Trump’s notice of intent to withdraw from NAFTA. As of this writing, the new “Statements and Releases” page on WhiteHouse.gov is empty. It's official. Join us in congratulating our 45th President of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump. A photo posted by The White House (@whitehouse) on Jan 20, 2017 at 11:20am PST The page titled “Trade Deals Working For All Americans” on the White House website speaks of rejecting failing trade deals, withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and negotiating better trade deals in order to help benefit suffering communities in the U.S. The White House website page titled “Bringing Back Jobs And Growth” claims that President Trump plans to reduce taxes for “Americans in every tax bracket” and make the tax code simpler — along with making the U.S. corporate tax rate less than it is today. Another new page on the White House website is titled “Making Our Military Strong Again,” which speaks of President Trump’s commitment to the heroic people of the military — as WhiteHouse.gov terms military folk — claims Mr. Trump will be committed to military veterans.

Name: Subject: Message: Google Play Services rolling out Instant Tethering mobile hotspot feature Apps & Games Newsby John Callaham1 week ago 5 764 32 A new and previously unannounced feature is starting to roll out today as part of a server-side update to Google Play Services. The new feature is called Instant Tethering, and it is supposed to make it easier to connect to a device with a mobile hotspot. See also: How to setup mobile Hotspot on Android October 11, 2016 Online reports say this feature is part of Google Play Services 10.2. Basically, if you own more than one Android device that shares one Google account, Instant Tethering will allow one of those products to find any of those others that also have a cellular data connection, so they can automatically connect to that device and share that data. This kind of feature will likely be helpful for people on the road who own a smartphone and an Android tablet… the latter of which might not have cellular hardware. In that case, the tablet can quickly connect to the smartphone’s data connection without a lot of fuss. This feature also displays the remaining battery life on that connecting device. While some people are reporting Instant Tethering as going live right now, it looks like Google is only beginning to roll out this feature, so it may take several days for this update to reach your devices.

The former Senior Vice President of Search and employee number 176 at Google has joined the ride-hailing company Uber as SVP of Engineering. TechCrunch is reporting that "Singhal will be heading up the Maps and Marketplace departments at Uber, while also advising CEO Travis Kalanick and Uber VP of Engineering and Otto co-founder Anthony Levandowski on their efforts to build out the company's self-driving technology." From the report: The last time we in tech news circles heard from Singhal, he was saying goodbye after a 15-year career at Google, in a farewell letter that felt a lot like a retirement announcement. Singhal wrote that he was leaving to "see what kind of impact [he could] make philanthropically" and to"spend more time with [his] family," in an effort to "define [his] next fifteen years." Now, a little under a year later, Singhal is back in an executive role -- this time at a much younger company, but still at one of the most influential technology firms in the world. So how did Singhal get from there to here? Well, for starters, Singhal did throw himself into philanthropic pursuits, focusing on the Singhal Foundation established by him and his wife Shipa, which aims to deliver access to high quality education for kids who normally wouldn't be able to attend top schools, and which began with a focus on the city of Jodhpur, in India. Singhal met Travis Kalanick through a mutual friend, which sparked a series of conversations between the search expert and the famous founder about Uber, its goals and its technical challenges. The combination of the scope of both Uber's potential impact, and the extent of the engineering hurdles it faces in achieving its aims were what drew Singhal in; he is, after all, a true engineer at heart, and mountainous technical challenges attract skilled engineers like nothing else. "This company is not only doing things that are amazing, this company also has some of the toughest computer science challenges that I have seen in my career of 25 years," Singhal told me. "Those computer science challenges for a computer science geek are just intriguing -- you give a geek a puzzle, they can't drop it; they need to solve the puzzle. That's how it felt to me." business google science ← You may like to read: → New Senate Bill Would Give US Grads Preference In Receiving H-1B Visas Tech Billionaires Are Asking Scientists For Help To Break Humans Out of Computer Simulation Electric Vehicles Can Meet Drivers' Needs Enough To Replace 90 Percent of Vehicles Now On The Road Bill Nye: Climate Change Denial Is 'Running Out of Steam,' Thanks To Millennials Neil deGrasse Tyson Says It's 'Very Likely' The Universe Is A Simulation Utah Governor: 'Porn Is a Public Health Crisis' Jay Z's Tidal Music Streaming Service Is Fraudulently Inflating Subscriber Numbers, Report Says Uber Hires Former Google Search Chief Amit Singhal As SVP of Engineering More | Reply Login Uber Hires Former Google Search Chief Amit Singhal As SVP of Engineering Post Load All Comments  Full  Abbreviated  Hidden /Sea Score: 5 4 3 2 1 0 -1 More | Reply Login   Nickname: Password: Public Terminal Forgot your password?

If you're using UberPool, the app needs to match riders going the same way. For that, it needs to take into account distance and traffic conditions. The same thing goes when an Uber driver is trying to get home and sets the destination filter, so the Uber driver doesn't ride back in the general direction of his home without passengers. There is also supply and demand to consider. Uber needs to predict which areas are going to have higher demand and then it needs to provide enough incentives for Uber drivers to alter their daily routines to go to those areas with higher demand. And of course, that demand will fluctuate from year to year based on different events, different weather conditions, Uber marketing, public transportation outages, and other unknown factors... In a small town in the middle of nowhere, all this work may show no result. But in cities like San Francisco or New York, where you absolutely can not hail a taxi downtown during rush hours (even if you happen to be white and well dressed), this makes a huge difference and usually means the difference between taking your car to work and paying $60 in parking for the day, or taking a combination of public transportation and Uber to work and paying a total of $20 a day.

The search giant is using its prime ad spots to promote its own products rather than reserving them for advertisers, its main clients. By Alex Eule Jan. 20, 2017 12:05 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Google has been using its ad spots to promote the company’s products, like the Google Pixel. Photo: Getty Images Google and its parent Alphabet have always had big ambitions, but a new report from the Wall Street Journal sheds some new light on its hopes and dreams. According to the Journal, Google has been using its most prime ad spots to advertise the company’s own products -- things like the Nest thermostat, Pixel smartphones, and the Google Home voice assistant. The paper analyzed 25,000 searches and found that in 91% of cases, products from Google units got the top paid ad spot on the search page. It’s an interesting strategy, since search ads represents a huge portion of Google’s revenue. And, it raises the question of whether Google now prioritizes products over its core ad business. In the journalism business, such internal promos are known as “house ads,” and they’re generally used when a publication doesn’t have more profitable advertising. That might not be the case here, but Google either doesn’t have as many ads to run anymore or it’s leaving ad money on the table, making a deliberate decision that growing product sales is more important. Either scenario is worth watching. Big Picture: Google is using its prime advertising to promote its own products.

The Pixel and Pixel XL's Google Assistant is the future according to Google. Image: raymond wong/mashable By Raymond Wong2017-01-20 23:52:11 UTC You might not have to buy a Google Pixel or Pixel XL to get the company's intelligent Assistant after all. LG's upcoming G6 smartphone might be the first non-Pixel phone to include Assistant, according to a report from BusinessKorea. LG is also said to be in talks with Amazon to possibly incorporate Alexa into future phones. SEE ALSO: 7 reasons Google’s Assistant stomps Siri When Google launched its Pixel phones in October, it touted Assistant as one of the main selling points. Google CEO Sundar Pichai called the Assistant "your own personal Google." In Mashable's testing, Assistant bested Siri in a number of ways. Allowing Assistant on non-Google phones could help make it mainstream faster. Amazon pursued a similar strategy by making Alexa an open platform for any device maker to use. With AI and digital assistants so hot these days, LG would be wise to strike a deal to get Assistant on its phones. The move would pair well with LG's decision to bake Assistant into its two upcoming Android Wear 2.0 smartwatches. The more interesting part of the report claims LG is also considering Alexa for its phones. LG already has a smart refrigerator with Alexa, so it's not a completely farfetched idea for the company to launch an Alexa-equipped phone. LG would also become the first company to release a phone with Alexa built in at the native level. Phone hardware may have become "boring," but that doesn't mean software has to be bland. This is poised to be the year of the digital assistant. Besides Google Assistant and Alexa, Samsung's expected to unleash its own digital assistant (codenamed "Bixby") starting with the Galaxy S8 this spring.  A G6 with Assistant could be just the phone LG needs to erase the G5 from our memory and compete with this year's new crop of AI-infused flagships.

(Image: Uber CEO Travis Kalanick/REUTERS File Photo) Ride-hailing company Uber Technologies Inc has hired the man behind Google search to work closely with Chief Executive Travis Kalanick and help grow the company's self-driving car program. Amit Singhal announced on his personal blog on Friday that he will join Uber after 15 years at Alphabet Inc, where he led Google's search division. Singhal will take the post of senior vice president of engineering, an Uber spokesman said, a role which oversees the company's marketplace and mapping efforts - the core of Uber's business. He will also act as an adviser to both Kalanick and Anthony Levandowski, who heads Uber's self-driving program.

"And don't even get me started on how interesting and exciting self-driving is for a computer scientist," he wrote. Uber debuted its self-driving car pilot in Pittsburgh, in September. It launched a second fleet in San Francisco last month, but a feud with California regulators over Uber's failure to obtain proper permitting compelled the company to take its autonomous testing cars off the streets.

Singhal announced his departure from Google nearly a year ago, and said his next career move would involve philanthropy. He founded the Singhal Foundation, which aims to provide education to underprivileged children in India. amit singhal Google uber Recommended For You Past Wins Against Roger Federer Mean Nothing, Says Rafael Nadal Sanjay Leela Bhansali Attacked by Karni Sena During Padmavati Shoot Star Tech: Watch SWAG King Raftaar's Take on Technology Maruti Suzuki Baleno RS: All You Need to Know Before the Launch Hero Motocorp and The Viral Fever Salutes The Indian Army Soldiers - 'The Real Heroes' Of The Country About Us Privacy Policy Disclaimer Contact Us Sitemap Complaint Redressal Advertise With Us sections India Lifestyle States Tech Politics Auto Sports iVideos Football Power Circuit Latest News UN Must Strenghten Action on Human Rights: Antonio Guterres Donald Trump Upbeat After Conversation With Mexican President Four Dead, One Injured in Separate Road Accidents in Delhi-NCR Nobel Peace Winner Malala 'Heartbroken' by Trump's Refugees Order I Don't Know Vladimir Putin: Donald Trump Watch LIVE From Network18 News18 India CricketNext News18 States Pradesh18 Bangla News Gujarati News Urdu News Marathi News Topper Moneycontrol Firstpost CompareIndia History India MTV India In.com Burrp CNN name, logo and all associated elements ® and © 2016 Cable News Network LP, LLLP.

While Meizu largely focuses on their home market, their smartphones are typically quite usable in Western territories, with near-perfect English localization. Better yet, Meizu employs a Xiaomi-like pricing structure such that most of their phones are aggressively priced for the hardware you get. The Pro 6 Plus is the highest-end smartphone currently sold by Meizu. It’s a true flagship, featuring the same Exynos SoC as seen in the Samsung Galaxy S7, a large 5.7-inch 1440p AMOLED display, and a beautiful aluminium unibody chassis. Even the camera, a 12-megapixel sensor with OIS and laser autofocus, is similar to what we see in high-end devices from Samsung, Google and Huawei. Despite packing top-end specifications, the Meizu Pro 6 Plus is an affordable handset in China, retailing for just CNY 2,999 (approximately US$430). It may cost a bit more than this to import the Pro 6 Plus into North America, but the handset should be available across Europe and Asia shortly. At this price, the Pro 6 Plus undercuts most of its competition, and directly competes with the OnePlus 3T. The Pro 6 Plus features one of the most beautiful smartphone designs I’ve seen. Meizu often nails the design of their entry-level products, but they’ve really hit it out of the park with their flagship offering. At the top of the table there’s a lot of tough competition, and throughout 2016 I saw fantastic designs from OnePlus, Samsung, Apple and HTC (to name a few). The Pro 6 Plus packs a design just as good as these ‘name brand’ handsets, and even beats it in some circumstances. Most of the Pro 6 Plus’ chassis is a single piece of metal, which encompasses the entire back panel and curves around the edges. The only parts of this rear panel that aren’t metal are the neat antenna lines at the top and bottom, along with the camera lens and flash array. The quality of metal used here is top notch: its matte finish looks exquisite and feels fantastic. I appreciate the minimalist design as well, which puts this metal on display without interference from plastic sections or separate panels. For a large phone, the Pro 6 Plus is remarkably ergonomic. The metal back curves perfectly into the edges, creating a comfortable rounded edge that makes the phone sit well in your hand. The phone is thin at 7.3mm, and surprisingly light at 158 grams, which helps with portability. In comparison, the ill-fated Galaxy Note 7 is slightly thicker and heavier for a similar battery capacity, while the iPhone 7 Plus is very similar in size but includes a smaller 5.5-inch display. The Pro 6 Plus doesn’t include the slimmest bezels I’ve seen, though they’re much slimmer than the monstrous bezels on the iPhone. The front of this phone is a massive piece of smooth glass, again curved to perfection along the edges for a swooshable touchscreen experience. Most of this front panel is occupied by the display – the Pro 6 Plus has a screen-to-body ration of 74% – although there is a speaker, camera and some sensors above the display, plus a fingerprint sensor below the display. I generally prefer rear fingerprint sensors compared to front sensors, but the position here isn’t bad. The sensor is fast and reasonably accurate, and while it’s not quite as good as the sensor found on the Google Pixel or the iPhone 7, it serves its purpose well. The sensor doubles as both a home and back button: clicking the sensor returns home, while tapping it like a touchscreen goes back. This functionality is included because, like other Meizu phones, there are no physical or on-screen navigation buttons to accompany the single home/back button. I strongly prefer a full array of navigation buttons for home, back, and recent apps, but it only takes a few weeks to fully adjust to Meizu’s navigation scheme. The main downside with this scheme is accessing the recent apps slider for multitasking, which requires swiping up from the bottom of the display. This is somewhat awkward and not as easy to activate as simply tapping a button. The fingerprint sensor is also supposed to double as a heart rate monitor, but I couldn’t find any software included on the device (or any popular third party apps) that supported this feature. Meizu says this feature will be introduced in a second update after Flyme 6 hits the handset. The position of the fingerprint sensor on the Pro 6 Plus means there is no stereo front facing speakers on this device. Instead, there is a single bottom-firing speaker of mediocre quality and volume. During landscape phone usage, particularly while gaming, this speaker is easy to block, so you’ll have to watch the position of your fingers at times. The bottom edge takes design inspiration from the iPhone 6s Plus and the Galaxy S7 Edge. In the center is a USB-C port for charging and data transfers, flanked by iPhone-like exposed pentalobe screws. This USB port supports USB 3.1 for fast data transfers, which is rare in smartphones despite most laptops supporting at least USB 3.1 through their USB-C ports. The speaker grille is on the right here, with a similar design to the Galaxy S7 Edge, while the important 3.5mm headphone jack is on the left. With all the ports found along the bottom edge of the Pro 6 Plus, the top is left relatively free, except for a single microphone. The Pro 6 Plus comes with a single tray on the left hand side that supports two nano-SIM cards. There is no microSD card slot included on this device, although you’ll get 64 GB of internal storage as standard with the option to upgrade to 128 GB. While I would have preferred to see a microSD card slot here, 64 GB of storage should be plenty for most users, and the 128 GB model is reasonably priced.

Tech Entertainment Business Social Deals Podcast About Mobile Image Source: iPhone-Crash, YouTube Galaxy S8’s best feature might have its own dedicated button Yoni Heisler @edibleapple January 20th, 2017 at 10:03 PM Share Tweet Looking to lessen its reliance on Google and further differentiate itself among a crowded field of Android handsets, Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy S8 smartphone will feature a brand new intelligent personal assistant, similar in nature to Siri on the iPhone. Don't Miss: You won’t believe how much Amazon is charging for Google’s Pixel XL Dubbed Bixby, Samsung’s AI assistant will be based on technology the company picked up when it acquired Viv this past October. What makes the forthcoming release of Bixby so intriguing is that Viv’s AI software was designed to answer layered questions that competing AI services are either unable to answer or struggle to process. For instance, Viv CEO Dag Kittlaus — who we should note helped develop Siri — explained that Viv can answer complex queries like, “Find me a flight to Dallas with a seat that Shaq could fit in.” While it remains to be seen just how extensive Bixby’s feature set will be once the Galaxy S8 hits store shelves, expectations are rather high. Indeed, we’ve already seen reports that Bixby will allow users to use voice commands to send money to friends and family. And just yesterday, word emerged that Bixby will be tightly integrated into the S8 camera and will be able to process text via OCR and even search for and identify objects. The most recent rumor involving Bixby centers on how users might call the feature into action. According to newly surfaced Galaxy S8 case renders , it appears that the Galaxy S8 may come with a fourth physical button. This had led some to speculate that this mysterious fourth button might be used as a way for users to quickly activate Bixby. As for other specs worth noting, the Galaxy S8 will likely feature an edgeless display, improved camera technology, 32GB of storage (with a 256GB model available), and an improved Super AMOLED display.

While there have been various rumors over the past couple months, a new one states that LG will be working with Google to bring its Assistant to its next handset. Google Assistant made its debut at an event in October and is currently only found on the Pixel and Pixel XL. Assistant tries to offer a more natural interaction and allows users to carry a conversation while making inquiries to Google. If true, this could give LG a fighting chance, considering that its competitor Samsung is poised to introduce its own AI assistant, Bixby, with the Galaxy S8. LG is expected to announce its latest handset at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. The event is scheduled for February 26 with a possible rollout of the handset a couple weeks later.

Skip to content Home News Sports Metro Plus Politics Business Entertainment Opinion Editorial Columnists Jobs Sections Search for: Entertainment Unnecessary politics in boardrooms puts me off –Olatorera Oniru Published January 21, 2017January 21, 2017 Share Tweet Pin it +1 Olatorera Oniru is the founder and CEO of Dressmeoutlet.com. In this interview with JESUSEGUN ALAGBE, she talks about her outlook on life, career, family and others In April 2016, Forbes described you as ‘the Nigerian woman who is building the fashion Amazon of Africa.’ How did you get that kind of recognition just two months after you launched Dressmeoutlet.com? I would assume a mix of factors was responsible. The market has a ton of opportunities that would interest a wide global audience and as a representative from Google once said to us, there is strong interest/demand for African products, yet there is low supply. The world is largely anticipating the boom of made in Africa products. The team at Forbes might have been impressed with the user interface, user experience or other factors they were able to decipher from Dressmeoutlet.com. To have also been nominated as a Most Promising Entrepreneur in Africa, surely they delved into my background, work experiences, awards and leadership potentials. You once worked at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Ericsson, the Central Bank of Nigeria and General Electric. Why did you quit regular jobs to launch Dressmeoutlet.com? I had a career growth plan from my entrepreneurship days and moving from paid employment to entrepreneurship was part of that plan. I worked in paid employment for over a decade across industries and across continents. My career plan was to accumulate solid education plus solid work experiences and then launch a series of notable businesses across Africa. Dressmeoutlet.com is the starting point for my post-employment business development goals. On the day you quit your last job to start your own company, what thoughts ran through your mind? I was relatively happy and this was probably because I was confident that the work experiences I had garnered were strong enough to propel me as an entrepreneur and I had saved up precisely well for the startup phase of the business. On the other hand, I knew I would miss the perks and comfort of the employed world — from frequent travels, to fixed salaries, to health care, pensions and more. All those perks could not hold me back much, if at all, because I was ready to create them and much more for myself and thousands of employees. This is why I continue to work tirelessly to grow the company and other businesses we are associated with. Within one year, Dressmeoutlet.com has grown to employ over 30 employees and we are not ready to slow down anytime soon. We want to continue sourcing and retailing the very best made in Africa fashion, beauty and home products to the world. How did working on Wall Street affect your outlook on life? Working on Wall Street was amazing — you get to feel and enjoy the real hustle and bustle of life. You also get to learn a whole lot. I took several free classes at the Merrill Lynch University and I networked with a lot of gurus in the industry. Sum up your experience in 2016 in three words. Start-up. Growth. Results. Were there times men intimidated you because of your success in the marketplace, especially as a woman, and tell us how you handled the intimidations? No intimidations here. We all have goals and missions in life. Everyone should be pushing their dreams and no one should be intimidated by another’s success or attempt to intimidate another based on their success. We must all push our dreams and support each other. Africa more than ever before needs much less competition and much more collaborations. Work together, push dreams and be great, individually and collectively. As many more citizens become great and greater, the entire nation will continue to grow into greatness. What’s the first thought that comes to your mind when you wake up? Appreciation for my beautiful family. My family means the world to me and I’m always glad and grateful to have them as we push our dreams together, smile together, laugh together and work hard together. Who is your favourite foreign artiste? I’m not sure I have a favourite, but over the years, I’ve enjoyed the music of Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston. Who is your favourite Nigerian artiste? I do not have a favourite, but I’ve liked certain songs produced by Mavin Records. Recently, I haven’t had as much time as I’d love to get to know the artistes behind the songs. As an entrepreneur and during your working years, you must have travelled to so many countries. Which is your favourite country so far? Nigeria remains my favourite and then the United States of America and then Turkey. All three are amazing countries, with Nigeria topping the list, as everything that makes me happy stems from within Nigeria — from my family, to investments, to friends, to career plans, and to growth potentials. The other two are second and third homes to me as I always have a great time when I go there and I lived in both for extended periods of time. If you could meet a legend, dead or alive, who would it be? If I could meet a legend, I’d say Sam Walton, the late founder of Walmart USA. Then maybe Jesus, regarded by Christians as the saviour of the world. Additionally, Coco Chanel, Mother Theresa and Oprah Winfrey. Who are the people who influence you in the business world? My father and my husband. What is your favourite business movie of all time? Honestly, I very rarely watch movies and if I do or ever have, I won’t remember the title. I only remember ‘Sound of Music’ and that’s about it. What is the greatest piece of advice you’ve ever heard? “Yes, we can” by Barack Obama. What keeps you awake at night while you should be sleeping? Work. I enjoy working, especially when I derive and exceed expected results. When my family goes to bed, I pull out my laptop and complete pending tasks and then create new tasks. It’s a non-stop cycle that I enjoy. What makes you angry? Anything unethical, wicked and unfair. I do not support wicked, unethical and unfair greed, also known as corruption — when certain men who forced themselves politically into leadership positions fail to create opportunities and developments yet harbour stolen wealth for themselves and the citizens who labour hard suffer in silence. If you were to give young women some pieces of advice to succeed in the marketplace, what would they be? Please, push your dreams. Don’t let anything stop you from doing anything great for the world. Be your very best in all your undertakings, love yourself and be the change you want to see in other leaders. Tell us how you met your husband? I met him during a business meeting we scheduled half a decade ago. We were discussing some business development plans and ended up loving each other’s company so much that we became a couple and then a family. What is your business philosophy? Work hard and innovate more. Do things because the impact is great — you are either able to change lives or make the world a better place. Money or personal wealth should not be the driving factors of greatness or success. What are your passions apart from business? Family, friends, dancing and having a great time. I love to have fun. I also still like travelling a bit. But lately, work doesn’t let me stay out of the country for more than 48 hours thereabout. What are the things that put you off in the boardroom? Lack of preparedness and unnecessary politics. Or being overly judgemental for personal reasons. Everyone should have equal rights to voice their opinions and contribute to discussions and developments. What qualities are essential for business success? Strength, vigour, versatility, love and care. What book are you reading now? Not reading one at the moment, but writing one. Looking back, tell us one singular decision you took that made you who you are today. Working on Wall Street was one of the best career decisions I made. I had other lucrative job offers after graduation and I’m very glad I went with the Wall Street offer. I learnt an ample lot, developed my financial acumen and grew significantly during my hustle and bustle years on Wall Street. I also made amazing friends that are still a significant part of my life today. As a leader, what does leadership mean to you? Leadership means having the means, resources and capabilities to do whatever it takes to make other people happy. Leaders are the driving forces of what they are leading. You are either driving a community, business, nation or family. Whatever you are driving, leaders must be great at what they do, they must have the knowledge and experience to succeed and they must have the love and passion for excellence and for making other people happy. Which business leader — Nigerian or foreign — has impacted your life most? I really enjoyed Barack Obama’s pre-presidency campaign and I also enjoyed his eight-year reign as president of one of the world’s greatest countries. His common quote “Yes we can” resonated very well with me throughout my university days and beyond. Copyright PUNCH.                All rights reserved.

Abiola I hate marriage by proxy , rubbish. D coming together of a man and a woman to sign d marriage agreement on d marriage day is one fit Africans have achieved. Cos it was done without the consent of d bride and groom b4. So if we are performing marriage in absentia nw , does it mean we are gradually reversing back to that old era ? Ahmed Marriage in absentia is not a taboo nor a terrible idea in Islam. As opined by Imam Abdulrahman “For this to be done, there has to be an assurance that both of them are really consenting to the union. The officiating minister must have spoken to both of them. He must have established on solid authority that the two parties are down with the arrangement. “It must be established that nobody is being coerced; nobody is being forced or tricked into such union. If there are practical difficulties of either of them being physically present, that would be the exceptional case I alluded to earlier on. It is not a taboo.” This is actually a personal experience where both parties and their parents knew each other and speak on a regular basis. The wife couldn’t take time off at work and I believe you’ll understand how the UK working system operates. The union is blessed with a child and both parties are living together in the UK. Sola I have a friend whose proxy wife has not been able to travel to join him going to 5 yrs now. The poor lady who is closed to menopause now is still waiting. Prince Adu/Tokyo IT’S IGBO STYLE. My Landlady before i left Nigeria had waited for her Husband in Germany for 15 years even when she knew the Man has married a German Woman with Kids as people were coming to tell her that the Husband has married,she was still waiting… This style is very common in IGBO LAND,all the names mentioned here are Igbos,…My Landlady Lives in ABA while she was also sleeping with Men too…..Is that Marriage too? Hans wow, Prince the african tribal warrior, did you read the story? Jurisconsult The first marriage ceremony in the Bible, that of Isaac and Rebecca was by proxy. Isaac was not there. Nothing wrong with it if there is good faith in the parties concerned. AduragbaPrayerpoint The story of how Isaac and Rebecca married was by divine arrangement. you may wish to know it was borne out of the fact Abraham and God had a convenantal relationship and so it was. Marriage by proxy today has to do with either material gain or out of desperation. In the late 90s,public servants were relocated to Abuja and many marriages were ruined irrepairably. The wise ones relocated with their spouses including some Christian couples while those who could afford flight always see their spouses every weekend until they sorted themselves out.Marriage by proxy should only be entertained in rare cases especially if the would- be couple have fulfilled all requirements and with the consent of the parents and the period of absentia not more than three months so that the devil with not capitalize on the vulnerability of either of them. The devil comes to steal, kill and destroy.Be wise! Toke This type of wedding is not that bad. It depends on who is living abroad between the couples. My uncle did it and is successful. He and his wife are living happily with there lovely kids in Canada. farooq such marriages are already under duress before they even start out………………… Kelvin This type of marriage can never stand the test of time Family Spice Special Features Education Vox Pop Sex & Relationship Letters Privacy Policy Terms of Use About punchng.com © 1971-2017 The Punch newspaper

Tech Silicon Valley’s Immigrant Community Anxiously Anticipates President Trump Donald Trump threatened to end high-skilled immigration to Silicon Valley. Then he took it back. Here’s how immigrants working in tech are feeling on the eve of his inauguration. Caroline O'Donovan BuzzFeed News Reporter View this image › David J. Phillip / AP ID: 10357784 Attending the same college that Google CEO Sundar Pichai went to was Nisha’s first step out of the poor neighborhood in India where she grew up. After graduating with a degree in computer science, she landed an internship at a tech company in California and, later, a job. For Nisha — not her real name; she asked to remain anonymous because the company she works for doesn’t allow employees to talk to journalists — that first job wasn’t just a gateway to a career in tech, but also to a visa, and the beginning of a permanent life in the United States. “Do I regret coming to the US?” Nisha told BuzzFeed News. “Not at all.” But now, like many high-skilled immigrants working in tech, especially those from India, Nisha finds herself in a situation far more tenuous than she anticipated when she moved to the US six years ago. Immigrants in Nisha’s position — she moved here at a time when President Barack Obama’s ambitious immigration agenda promised to resolve the bureaucratic speed bumps around high-skilled immigration — are now facing an incoming Trump administration that has threatened to crack down on legal immigration. Already in the midst of a decade-long wait for a green card, they’re wondering whether forthcoming policy decisions will make their lives in the US more difficult — or impossible. “I’ve made peace the with the fact that I probably won’t get a green card in my lifetime,” Nisha said. Currently, 65,000 visas for high-skilled workers — known as H-1Bs — are allotted each year. While engineers come from all over the world to work in the US tech industry, a particularly large number come from India. But a much smaller number of Indians are granted green cards, and this has caused a decades-long backlog in the system. Since the election, Madhuri Nemali, an immigration attorney who specializes in small businesses hiring foreign workers, has been hoping to avoid telling her clients “it’s going to get worse than it already is.” “I don’t want to have to do that,” she said. “But I’m thinking I’ll probably have to, based on the rhetoric from last year.” An engineer at Cisco who asked to remain anonymous has been waiting for a green card for five years. He’s optimistic that the recent gathering of tech CEOs at Trump Tower will mean more immigrant-friendly policies under the new administration. But even so, he plans to return to India within the next five years, where’s he’s confident that, given his résumé, he’ll find a job with a US company. Many — including Google, Apple, Facebook, Intel, and Cisco — have campuses In India now. “I don’t see a possibility unless something drastic happens with regards to green card regulations,” he said. “It’s been an excruciating process.” How Trump’s administration plans to handle immigration policy for high-skilled workers remains, on the eve of his inauguration, more or less a mystery. After declaring last year that he would “end forever” the use of high-skilled immigrant workers as cheap labor, Trump later hedged, acknowledging that we “need highly skilled people in this country.” His administration is actively considering reforms for the program, with Reuters reporting that meetings with tech CEOs have nudged the president-elect further in favor of the program. The high-skilled immigration program does have a legitimate gray market fraud problem, which regulators have recently begun to crack down on. Meanwhile, Republican Congressman Darrell Issa has recently reintroduced legislation that would limit skilled immigration to the US. One anonymous engineer who’s three years into his green card wait described how, for immigrants in Silicon Valley, everyday financial decisions around taxes, 401Ks, and stock options are more complicated because of the precariousness of their positions. “Everything else all along was bad — but at least it was predictably bad,” he said. Already, this engineer explained, things like becoming a startup founder are more or less off-limits to him because of what investors perceive as unnecessary risk. Now, the possibility of further job insecurity and economic stability is exacerbating those frustrations. For example, immigrants who lose their jobs have 30 days to find a new one or leave the country, a predicament that would be much worse if the economy dips and major tech companies initiate hiring freezes, as they did during the 2008 recession. “If the economy goes south, the housing market will go down as well. In a month, you might have to do a fire sale of your house because you might never be able to enter the US again to sell it,” he said. Current visa holders are hoping new regulations won’t impact immigrants who are already here. But given the current climate, they’re not rushing to encourage friends and family back home to join them. Avinash Conda, an engineer and immigration reform advocate, said he recently cautioned a cousin planning to get his master’s in the US against the idea, at least for now. “My suggestion for now is stay tight, at least for another year,” Conda said. “Let the president walk in, and see what happens — on April 1, how many applications are filed — what are the new laws being passed, and we’ll have to take it from there.” Others reported telling loved ones back home to consider getting an education in Canada, where tech companies have big offices and it’s easier to get residency. “The job opportunities aren’t as good as in the US, but are still pretty good,” said one anonymous tech worker. Nisha, the engineer who went to the same college as Google’s CEO, shares the same concerns. If the worst should happen, she’s confident her employer could move her to an office somewhere in Europe, or Canada — or even back to India. But she’s also worried about moving away from headquarters in Silicon Valley, where “all the interesting stuff that attracts people” gets done. A move like that could delay her career goals — possibly forever. “If I move back right now, it’s sort of a dead end for me,” she said. “But I grew up next to a slum in India. I’ve seen way more difficult times than anything that could possibly happen now.” Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!

STARTUP Snapchat Flipflops On Creepiness And Enables Ad Targeting Advertisers can now use third party data to target user profiles on Snapchat, which will surely boost Snap's revenue in the buildup to going public. By Alex Moazed Alex Moazed is the CEO of Applico, which he founded with credit cards in college. He advises companies like Google and those in Highland Capital's portfolio on platform innovation and has developed more than 300 apps. @AlexMoazed Founder and CEO, Applico@AlexMoazed WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Whether users like it or not, Snap Inc. is quietly becoming more like its competitors in the buildup to its hotly anticipated initial public offering. In an effort to generate more revenue and meet its billion-dollar goal for advertising revenue, the company has opened its gates to third party data. Recently, the camera company inked a deal with Oracle Data Cloud, which will empower marketers and advertisers to target tranches of users based on activity conduced outside of the Snapchat app. This move is intriguing for two main reasons: it runs directly counter to previous statements by CEO Evan Spiegel and it's sure to boost revenue for the startup in its pre-IPO run. Oh, Snap Spiegel claimed he would never want Snapchat to become a home for ads he dubbed "creepy." He was referring to his experience seeing products advertised to him that he searched for days prior, a common occurrence for internet users everywhere who don't use the appropriate blockers. Given Spiegel's hard stance on this (and the recency of it), this move will largely be seen as hypocritical by privacy advocates and the more observant users, but given the current inefficacy of the platform's ads, it's unlikely to significantly turn off any users, especially since they can opt out of the data sharing as desired. That said, this change does make Snap look more and more like its rivals, Facebook and Twitter. The shift in ad strategy does not exist alone in a vacuum, though. Snap has been mired in a few controversies lately. First, the company is going to face some massive scaling problems, akin to Twitter around the time of its IPO. Its approach for generating ad impressions has been broken for some time and it lacks an algorithm, which forecasts a struggle for optimizing the audience impressions. Additionally, Snap was slapped with a wrongful termination suit from an ex-employee who claims he was fired for not helping the company misrepresent its user engagement numbers to the public. Snap has a lot of damage control and soul-searching to do before its IPO and sneaking a major change like this on users doesn't provide great optics, but it serves to grow revenue faster and hit that $1 billion revenue mark and justify a potentially $25 billion IPO. A Long Road Ahead Probably one of the most talked-about pieces of tech news for 2017, this IPO is one of the most anticipated of the last few year. $25 billion is an objectively huge number and the Snapchat app doesn't appear to offer the monetization necessary to justify that price tag. Opening Snapchat to outside data aggregators is a good first move, strictly speaking in terms of revenue growth. If advertisers can use information on users' buying and browsing habits, they can make better decisions on their ad buys and receive more valuable impressions. More valuable impressions mean that Snap can eventually raise the price point (assuming user engagement doesn't go south) and generate more revenue. As well, more companies will be enticed to advertising on Snapchat if it means widespread, proven engagement. The road ahead is an arduous one for the LA-based startup to reach its IPO already, but the problems Snap has with monetization and justifying its immense valuation leave it strewn with pitfalls and land mines. Spiegel and his team will need to carefully evaluate their strategy moving forward if they want to validate $25 billion of public investment.

The annual income from “the 10% vig,” oops, tax — estimated to be close to $1 trillion by the end of President Barack Obama’s second term — would nearly wipe out the current budget deficit. State and local casino and lottery operations would not affected by the new national legislation. Code named “You Bet Your Ass,” the concept was conceived in a late night drinking and strategy session in May when it seemed obvious to the president’s senior advisors that a second dip of the economy was all but inevitable. As the fifth fifth of Talisker scotch — the current beverage of choice in Washington — was passed around the table, the always mild-mannered chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, slurred the battle cry of the forthcoming campaign: “I’ll give you 10:1 odds that we kick the shit out of those MF’s in 2012.” At that moment, Moshe Peddler, the senior partner of Peddler and Marconi Communications and the president’s outside media maven, felt he had been hit by a thunderbolt. Nevertheless, it took him all night to put the pieces together: that “10:1 odds” phrase, combined with a lifetime of peddling crap, meant federal control and the “taxing” of online gambling. A quick Google search revealed that it was already legal in some major European countries. Internet gambling was coming. The only question was who would control it: the casino operators or Uncle Sam? Today, the Democrats had control of Congress and maybe they could ram it through. After the elections, who knew? Using $200,000 of his company’s political slush funds, Peddler went right to work: grassroots call-ins the next morning to 2,500 radio stations, followed up by in-depth research. That evening, 3,547 land line and cell phone surveys were conducted on two key issues: First, 73% wanted internet gambling; and, second, the public didn’t give a damn who controlled it, as long as they got to play an honest game of Texas Hold? Em. The next morning, Moshe, Rahm and the President sat down for a super secret meeting. Everyone else was banished. Even the secret recording system was shut down. In five minutes, Moshe presented his plan, his research, the preliminary numbers from the budget office and his findings. The chief of staff was so happy he danced on nine fingers. Maybe he would stay the full term after all. The president was another story. Obviously, he’d piss off the religious right and the casino owners. But they were leaning GOP anyway. If Peddler’s numbers were right, he’d come close to wiping out the budget deficit. He figured that plus health care might make him the fifth face on Mt. Rushmore. Peddler read his boss’ face. He was the best closer on the planet, and went in for the kill like Tyson in his prime. “Mr. President, did you know that England and France have already legalized Internet gambling? Denmark has finished its legislation and Germany, Switzerland and Spain are goose-stepping to be next in line. We either try to regulate and tax it, or people are going to go to the offshore operators, where you don’t get any revenue.” The president was sold. “Rahm,” said the now beaming Obama, “alert all the cable and networks for a major address for Sunday at nine. And make sure those budget numbers are right. “Finally, we need a slogan. Something like: Game On.” Bill Regardie was the founder and publisher of Regardie’s Magazine.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Site Archive log in weather JOSEPH GIGLIO: Automakers under pressure to reinvent the industry Saturday Jan 21, 2017 at 12:01 AM Joseph M. Giglio Automakers face unprecedented technological changes and market trends that will ultimately force them along with the Cleveland Browns and the Democratic Party to reinvent their business models. Sources of disruption include electric vehicles; connectivity; autonomous vehicles, including trucks; changing patterns of car ownership and use; and on-demand ride services. Car companies face an array of new competitors. Besides their traditional rivals, new market entrants including Google, Apple, Tesla, Uber, and Lyft, are fielding new technology vehicles. Technology is but one of the threats that connected, automated and autonomous driving are introducing to the industry. Connected vehicles are able to “talk” with one-another through radio frequency devices or cellular technology. General Motors plans to have connected vehicles on the street by the end of the year. The 2017 Cadillac CTS sports sedan will offer technology that allows sharing information about driving conditions like weather, speed, sudden braking and more. Other automakers are expected to follow suit. Automated and autonomous driving is more complicated. Automated cars use on-board sensors and systems to aid the driver, while autonomous vehicles actually do the driving. It is unclear whether fully autonomous vehicles are 10 or 15 years away. Autonomous vehicles may get the attention, but the notion of cars talking to one another is the real deal. Vehicle connectivity has garnered great interest from the U.S. Department of Transportation. The Holy Grail of connectivity is vehicles talking with one another without human intervention. The feds have bet that such communication will prevent millions of crashes that result in thousands of fatalities. Last December, USDOT proposed rules requiring that all new cars and small trucks contain technology allowing them to broadcast data to other vehicles within a 984-foot radius about their speed, location and direction. The proposed rules will standardize how one car talks to another and warns drivers, and eventually autonomous vehicles, about potential dangers. The car- maker determines what to do with the data, be it automated braking or a visual dashboard warning. At an intersection, vehicles would decide if you have enough time to make that right on red and who gets to go next at a four-way stop. According to the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration, the vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) equipment and supporting communications functions would cost about $350 per vehicle in 2020. If the rule is adopted, the feds say all new cars would have the technology in four years. The rule would not require existing vehicles to be retrofitted. As technology evolves, automobiles will likely become more connected to people’s home and mobile devices, and integrated into the internet of things. Deployment of V2V technologies faces a number of hurdles, such as data security and privacy concerns. If V2V communications get hacked, the possibilities for traffic accidents increases. Then there is the question of the underlying technology that would enable V2V communication. The feds mandate the use of dedicated short-range communications (DSRC). Many believe DSRC is obsolete and that newer technologies, such as 5G cellular wireless to power smartphone communication, will be released before DSRC market penetration is achieved. Moreover, critics argue that cellular has already built infrastructure in the form of cell towers, obviating the need to for state and local governments to roll out dedicated short-range receivers on roadside infrastructure. The other half of the communication network is vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I). USDOT plans to issue guidance on V2I communications, which in theory should help transportation planners integrate the technologies to allow vehicles to “talk” to roadway infrastructure such as traffic lights, stop signs, and work zones to improve mobility, reduce congestion, and improve safety. No matter how the technology battle sorts out, the car of the future will be connected. Our transportation system is on the cusp of a transformation, with technology bridging the gap between vehicles and intelligent roadside infrastructure, creating a network that works like the internet and can prevent collisions, keep traffic moving and reduce environmental impacts.

Below we’ll explain how to quickly fix this for most users. Advertisement Android smartphones and tablet have a lot of different security measures in place, and apps do too. Many users end up enabling some administrator policy or encryption at some point, and later realize they can’t access or change certain settings and options on their phone. Read: 8 Common Galaxy Note 5 Problems & Fixes I recently ran into the “disabled by administrator” error on the Samsung Galaxy Note 5 while trying to disable my fingerprint lockscreen security, and go back to a regular swipe to unlock, or pin. Below is a quick fix to solve this problem for Samsung Galaxy users, or any Android smartphone or tablet. Advertisement Advertisement Heading into settings on the Samsung Galaxy Note 5 and other phones, some users may notice that all lockscreen and security options are disabled, and greyed out. Rather than being able to change these settings, an error message in grey pops up instead that reads, “Disabled by Administrator, encryption policy, or credential storage”. Once this happens users aren’t able to change their lockscreen security from a pattern to a pincode, use a fingerprint, or go from a fingerprint lockscreen security measure back to something else. With the Jelly Bean update Google added encryption to Android, and ever since this has been an occasional problem for Samsung Galaxy owners. Those wanting to simply switch back to swipe to unlock on their phone, on Samsung devices just select “None” under the lockscreen settings, which defaults to the swipe method. If you have the problem mentioned here, read on for more details. If you’re facing the dreaded “Disabled by Administrator, encryption policy, or credential storage” error on your Samsung Galaxy S6, Note 5, or other devices, here’s how to quickly fix it and get access to all of your settings and lockscreen options. Instructions This typically happens if your smartphone or tablet is encrypted, which protects files or certain aspects of the device. Those using Samsung Pay, Android Pay, Outlook or some other apps may find that this error appears, and they’re unable to change certain settings. Here’s how to fix it. Advertisement Users will need to head into the settings menu on their Samsung Galaxy or other smartphone and tablet and clear the credentials. Once this is done, these options will no longer be greyed out. Below are some screenshots for help, as well as step-by-step instructions. Navigate to “Settings” Personal Column and select “Lockscreen and security” Then select “Other security settings” or “More” Scroll down to Credential storage and select “Clear credentials” Now Change the lockscreen and other settings options Once selected the “Clear credentials” option will be greyed out, everything will be cleared, and users will have access to all settings again. If it’s already greyed out, there’s another problem and we’d suggest heading to a few forums for help. For whatever reason changes to the credentials because of Samsung Pay, some secure 3rd party apps, or switching to something like a fingerprint for lockscreen security appears to disable certain options or settings from being changed. All users need to do is follow the steps above and clear the credentials, and it should fix this error message. It’s worth noting that this will not erase fingerprints that have been saved to a device like the Galaxy S6 or Galaxy Note 5, or delete patterns, pins, or passwords. Users will then be able to select the lockscreen method of choice, and continue using their phone. Advertisement This is an odd error that we’ve been getting asked and more and more, so give the steps above a try and regain control of your Samsung Galaxy smartphone, or other Android devices. 48 Responses 12/15/2015 Benitojknisley Reply 1=117 Here is how i am making 85$ an hour… After been without work for 6 months, i started freelancing over this website and now i couldn’t be happier.

Thank you for this great advice. I have been trying to find the answer to this question for a long time now. Your answer helped me so much as I needed to change my security from pattern to pin. I was watching TV one day and I caught a glimpse of my pad out of the corner of my eye. The light was shining on it at just the right angle. I noticed that you could see my pattern very clearly. So if you wish to use the “pattern” security make sure to clean your pad and phone after you are done other wise some one can actually see and use the pattern that was left behind from the oils or dirt from your fingers. Some one may have come across this bad security flaw but I have not heard of this at all. Keep safe and make sure to clean your screens before walking away from you devices. Always practice safe browsing:{) Tim 03/12/2016 Parul Reply Hi guys..clear credentials is also greyed out..and I cannot switch back to fingerprint. .any suggestions? 03/24/2016 Kelvin Reply check whether u can change the lock screen method on Setting>Lock Screen>Screen Lock… i got mine unlock there…. 03/13/2016 Aranea Reply It worked!

TechWhack Review Best Sites Here Top Best Torrent Sites To Download Torrents [2017] January 22, 2017 By Harsh 24 Comments Top Best Torrent Sites To Download Torrents [2017] 3.53/5 127 votes So guys today TechWhack has brought a new article on best torrent sites to download torrents. Young generation spends most of the time on the internet rather than on the TV. They keep on downloading games and movies from the web.  The Internet is becoming a great source of entertainment. Torrent sites are most harmful sites that may harm you in the form of virus or annoying ads. But these sites are really helpful as we all know. The government sometimes also blocks best torrent sites, when they are blocking spammy torrent sites. So we created a big list of best torrenting sites or torrent websites. These best torrent sites can be found on torrent search engine name torrentz2.eu. You only need a good torrent software. These best torrent websites contain ads, but these ads are not annoying. Why do we need torrent sites? We all love hacks. Torrents are most trustworthy websites which contain all premium softwares or plugins. I am talking about Best Torrent Sites to Download torrents. You can download nulled software’s or plugins for free which you’ll need to pay for on other non-torrent sites. The network of torrent websites is so large that they have an enormous database for sharing files with us. These sites are independent sites which have all the database uploaded on their server rather than those unworking external links. This site even shares secret files. Other sites don’t share these secret files because they are not allowed. You can even upload and create your torrent file. That’s why they even get a ban on them sometimes. Watch Free Movies Online How torrents work?  Torrents sites have a large independent network for sharing databases. The best torrent sites are legal sites. Downloading depends on upon seed, peers, and leeches. Torrents is simply a server or a storage space. You download files from this space Torrent is a network of superfast computers. When someone uploads a file on a torrent with torrent extension, the torrents site reaches the torrent tracker and activates it on its server. Torrent trackers connect with your software like utorrent or BitTorrent. Then these tracker submits your IP address to the site and then download the software(specified by you) in small pieces. The software not downloads files from the tracker rather tracker acts as an agent between the torrent software and site(server) or supercomputer. You are called leecher or peerer when you download torrent files. You are called seeder when you have already downloaded the torrent file. The database from which they take files is not good and full of viruses etc. But the below listed torrent sites are amazing and would not harm your computer. Free movie downloads How to download files from torrent sites? If you want to download a torrent file, you can google it using the search string “your file or name of software + torrent.” You need a torrent client for it example utorrent. You will find a site in google’s result page named torrentz.eu. It is the torrent search engine. There you can download files. It will show a lot of torrent sites where the file is available. Kat.cr or kickass torrent is a most preferred site, or its alternative is the pirate bay. Now you can download from the torrent sites. Click on the downloaded file and then it will start downloading in your torrent software after some approvals. Now The List Best Torrent Sites To Download Torrents Starts. These Are Best Torrenting Sites Or Torrent Websites  Katcr.co The kickass torrent I have been talking about is one of the best torrent sites to download torrents.

 Trump just made a vocal opponent of today's 'open internet' laws the next FCC boss Jeff Dunn Jan. 23, 2017, 5:19 PM 87,080 facebook linkedin twitter email print Ajit Pai, right, and former FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler. Getty/Chip Somodevilla President Donald Trump has named Ajit Pai as the 34th chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. Pai confirmed the appointment on Twitter on Monday. Politico's Alex Byers and Tony Romm first reported the news last week. Pai has served as a GOP commissioner at the FCC since 2012. He was widely expected to at least be named interim chairman after outgoing boss Tom Wheeler announced he would depart the agency on Inauguration Day. Pai, however, has been named Wheeler's official replacement. Pai will be able to take the mantle immediately since he has already been confirmed by the Senate as a commissioner under Barack Obama's administration. This afternoon, I was informed that @POTUS @realDonaldTrump designated me the 34th Chairman of the @FCC. It is a deeply humbling honor. pic.twitter.com/Joza18aP33 — Ajit Pai (@AjitPaiFCC) January 23, 2017 While expected, the appointment aligns with signs that Trump's FCC would roll back Obama-era policies — most notably the 2015 Open Internet Order, which set today's net-neutrality rules. Broadly speaking, those laws regulate the internet as a public utility. More practically, they're meant to keep internet service providers from blocking or slowing down certain content — which could benefit services owned by an ISP itself — or forcing others to pay fees to receive preferential treatment. Larger telecom companies like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T have generally opposed the 2015 law, while smaller ISPs and internet companies like Netflix and Google, among others, have expressed support. Pai has vocally dissented from most of Wheeler's policies, however, and, along with fellow Republican commissioner Michael O'Rielly, he voted against the net-neutrality order in 2015. He also opposed Wheeler's proposed reform of the set-top-box market. Instead, he has maintained a strong desire to deregulate telecoms companies and lessen the reach of the FCC as a whole — a view that has often sat favorably with large ISPs. In a December speech to the conservative-leaning Free State Foundation, for instance, Pai said he was "more confident than ever" that the current net-neutrality law's "days are numbered," and that he'd like the future FCC to "fire up the weed wacker" and remove numerous regulations currently in place. Reuters/Jonathan Ernst A recent report from Multichannel News said that Trump's FCC transition team is aiming to follow along those lines by removing some of the FCC's regulatory powers and shifting them to other agencies like the Federal Trade Commission. Wheeler has said that such moves could dramatically lessen the ability of large ISPs to be affected by federal oversight. Pai will take control of a shorthanded FCC to start, with O'Rielly and Democrat Mignon Clyburn the only commissioners. Trump will have to name another Democrat and another Republican to fill out the agency. Pai, with the help of the Republican-led Senate, is now in a position to put their plans in motion as soon as possible, according to Ernesto Falcon, legislative counsel at the nonprofit Electronic Frontier Foundation. Any changes to net neutrality laws and the like would take months, though, and include a period of public comment.  Like Wheeler, Pai has spent time directly serving telecom interests, having worked as a lawyer for Verizon from 2001 to 2003. (Notably, he's also a former staffer for Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, a close Trump aide and Trump's pick for attorney general.) If he follows through on his past rhetoric, however, his FCC is likely to take a sharp turn from what we've seen in the past four years.

Soundariya Preetha and Wilson Thomas COIMBATORE: January 21, 2017 09:12 IST Updated: January 21, 2017 09:12 IST Share Article PRINT A A A Citizens play drums in Coimbatore on Friday during protest against ban on jallikattu   M. Soundariya Preetha and Wilson Thomas COIMBATORE: January 21, 2017 09:12 IST Updated: January 21, 2017 09:12 IST more-in It was a sea of humanity at VOC Grounds in Coimbatore on Friday, with people from all walks of life congregating to protest for jallikattu for the fourth day. As the protesters on the ground held placards, listened to speakers, and sat in silence demanding that jallikattu be held, crowds shouted slogans against PETA, and the Union and State Governments. They took out rallies along roads outside the venue. The demand for conduct of the traditional sport was supported with thaarai thappattai beats by groups from different parts of the city and silambattam performances just outside the ground. From Kodai Vallal Pari to Google head Sundar Pichai, the names of Tamil poets, artistes, historical figures, musicians, and even corporate heads who have made a mark in the international field were mentioned in some of the talks, and placards. The demands by some groups expanded to Tamil Eelam and Cauvery water too. The ground and its surrounding areas witnessed a crowd not less than 35,000 on the fourth day of the protest on Friday. Lawyers practising at various courts in the city extended support to the protesters by staying away from work. Coimbatore district united Jamaat extended solidarity to the protesters by taking out a procession to the venue. More number of families joined the protest on Friday as shops, hotels, bakeries, micro industrial units, and education institutions remained closed. Pushpa was at the venue at 9.30 a.m. on Friday with her eight-month-old grand daughter and some other family members. “We have seen the jallikattu. I am here to take part in the protest as we are fighting for our rights,” she said. Vahitha of Ramanathapuram had come with her neighbours. “I came for the protest with family members after seeing the enthusiasm of the students on TV. The crowd is a testimony of how Tamilians stand united,” said M. Chithra of Ondipudur who had come with her eight-month-old daughter Kavya and family members. Thulasimani and her husband from Peelamedu came to the ground every day to take part in the protest. “We are here to support the students. My daughter is working in an IT company in Chennai and she goes to the Marina. My elder daughter is in Trichy and she too takes part at the protests there,” said Thulasimani. V. Ramasamy, an 86-year-old man from Saravanampatty who was spotted at the ground, said that the ambience of the protest being echoed in the ground reminded him of his participation anti-Hindi agitation in 1965 as a 30-year-old. A group of five girls carrying the poster 'Free hugs to brave Tamil women' lauded the presence of women at the protest venue by giving them hugs. Hundreds of students and volunteers formed human chains and distributed food packets, snacks, water packets and cool drinks, collected the waste plates, cups, and wrappers, ensured space for all those who gathered at the venue and regulated the crowd. For smooth supply of food, water and other essential materials, the core group controlling protest made crowd to sit as multiple groups, creating ways for volunteers. The volunteers and the crowd also efficiently handled movement of ambulances at times of minor medical emergencies. Electrolyte, medicines, sanitary napkins were distributed at the medical centre, mobile phone charging facilities were organised, and several members of the public cooked food at home and came with their family members to the venue to distribute it to the protesters. Apart from native people, people from other parts of the country settled in Coimbatore have also shared the spirit of pro-jallikattu protest. “I had the luck of watching jallikattu once in Madurai and I was surprised by the valour of participants. The heroism of participants in jallikattu must be seen and believed as its much higher than that of the matadors in Spanish bullfighting. Having come to Coimbatore at the age of three, Tamil culture is deeply rooted in my blood and I easily understand their emotions,” said Tony Singh, a businessman. A youth who attempted to hang himself at the protest venue created tension in the afternoon. He was pacified by other protesters. A section of youth dumped carbonated beverages manufactured by foreign companies on LIC Road as part of the protest. Though roosters, stud bulls, and native cow breeds were brought to the venue, they were not permitted inside. Trains blocked Around 500 DMK activists staged a protest at the North Coimbatore Railway Junction on Friday morning, demanding that jallikattu be held. Led by former Minister for Animal Husbandry Pongalur N. Palanisamy, and N. Karthik, MLA, they sat on the tracks and shouted slogans against the Union and State Governments. Mr. Palanisamy said that it was wrong to blame the DMK for the ban on jallikattu as it had allowed the conduct of the sport until it was in power in 2011. The protesters stopped the Kerala Express and the Vivek Express. The police removed the protesters. One of the passengers of the Kerala Express was taken to a hospital as he suffered chest pain. The DMK activists staged protest at railway junctions in Peelamedu and Irugur. The Government Law College students staged a protest at the Coimbatore Railway Junction. The protest at the North Coimbatore Station delayed the running of trains. Spirited trouble With at least nine TASMAC outlets remaining open within 2km radius of the protest venue, miscreants in an inebriated condition created tension on roads outside VOC Grounds. Near Park Gate junction on Dr. Nanjappa Road, a few men in high spirits blocked taxis and autorickshaws posing as supporters of jallikattu. They threatened taxi and autorickshaw drivers to offer free rides to people and used filthy language against women accusing them that they were not supporting the protest. Later, the police deployed additional men in front of TASMAC outlets to control unruly tipplers. Volunteers at the main venue restricted entry of people in a drunken state. Those who thronged outside the protest venue were seen elated after Chief Minister made an announcement that an ordinance would be promulgated permitting jallikattu. Some of the groups that were conducting separate protests around the main venue were not permitted inside the VOC Grounds. Members of the core committee said that those coming as separate groups were not entertained as they were shifting the focus of the agitation. Politics Groups carrying posters and placards of political parties were kept at a bay. A group of drama artists staged a hunger strike outside the main venue.

I don’t get this good a seat at Versace! Never did I think when I sat tipsy and dumbstruck in the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland last July, amid aging frat boys screaming “Lock her up,” that I would find myself here in Washington six months later, and in the second row! I am so close to the dais that I can see the red spot on the back of the United States Marine Band’s conductor’s shaved neck. The ceremonies get under way slowly, with the introduction of governors, former vice presidents, Supreme Court justices, and senators—all of whom are here, as opposed to the 60-plus members of the House of Representatives who are giving the day a miss. The roster is long, the sun is valiantly trying to gain a foothold, and the band plays on—so chic in their fingerless white gloves and the ropy epaulets on their natty uniforms. When they swing into “Stars and Stripes Forever,” it is impossible not to feel at least a tiny thrill, even if you think the lyrics are “a duck may be somebody’s mother.” But now the intros are heating up! When Hillary Clinton is announced, I hear a couple of women behind me, who have been functioning as a Greek chorus of commentary throughout the proceedings, mutter “What is she doing here?” I let out an inadvertent Woo-hoo! at the mention of her name, and though it doesn’t win me any friends, no one is really staring daggers at me either. Which is a funny thing about Americans at this deeply strange moment—it is impossible to tell who is who. Some big beefy guys on the metro, who I dismiss as typical Trumpsters, turn out to be wearing Veterans For Peace sweatshirts. A woman outside a cathedral who seems like Dana Carvey’s church lady is actually handing out leaflets informing you that the church is open with bathrooms and hot chocolate today, and also for the demo tomorrow. When the color guard arrives, we are asked to stand, and then, as the programme grinds on, we are compelled to remain standing. After a half-hour of being on one’s feet while people like the Pence daughters are announced, and then being forced to stay erect when Clarence Thomas administers the oath of office to their dad, is it any wonder that one’s mood, like the sky, begins to darken? Plus the glory of the second row is also sadly dimming: turns out the catwalk—I mean the podium—is actually high above our heads. If you strain, you can catch a glimpse of Chuck Schumer from the eyeglasses up. The miniature people hovering on the platform are barely discernable—I think three different men could be John McCain. Is that Jimmy Carter with that cap? Could that speck receding in the far distance be Hillary Clinton herself? Senator Roy Blunt, Chairman of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, gives the opening remarks. He reminds us of the famous Franklin D. Roosevelt quote about nothing to fear but fear itself, but he doesn’t actually mention Roosevelt by name. That president authored the incredible benefit of Social Security, fiercely opposed in Roosevelt’s day. The Mormon Tabernacle Choir—minus at least one member who declined to appear—offers “America the Beautiful,” and because everyone, including me, has a phone in his or her hands at all times, I discreetly Google this song, hoping it was written by some blacklisted lyricist. (It was not.) The first thing that comes up on Google is Paul Simon’s “America,” which was also one of Bernie Sanders’s campaign songs, in what now seems like a million years ago. “Ooh, I see him!” cries a member of the Greek chorus, and I see him too—or at least I see the top three-quarters of his head. Are we allowed to sit? With the rebellious sprit that is our birthright as Americans, half of us do. It starts raining the exact minute the new president begins speaking. He thanks the Obamas and says they are magnificent. He says he intends to transfer power from Washington, D.C., and give it back to the people. He adds that this is your moment and your moment belongs to you. “From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land. From this moment on, it’s going to be America First.” Suddenly a woman appears out of nowhere, a chimera rising from the dust. She rushes to the front of the bandstand shouting, “Donald Trump is an illegitimate president!” and unfurls a banner. She is quickly hustled away; there is no reaction from the podium. “When you open your heart to patriotism,” Trump tells us, “there is no room for prejudice.” I am not sure if this is true. I am thinking about it, about what it means to be patriotic, to love your country in the best of times and in the worst, when Bishop Wayne Jackson, giving one of the benedictions, references Mahalia Jackson’s words,“We are on our way to victory, I do believe.” Victory had perhaps rather a different meaning for Jackson, a legendary gospel singer and fierce fighter for civil rights. She sang in support of the Montgomery bus boycott; she traveled with Martin Luther King Jr. On August 28, 1963, Jackson performed at the Lincoln Memorial, not very far from where we are sitting right now. On that occasion, she delivered the spiritual, “I’ve Been ‘Buked and I’ve Been Scorned.” Here are its lyrics: I’ve been ’buked and I’ve been scorned I’ve been ’buked and I’ve been scorned Yes, I’ve been talked about so, But the one thing I’ve done wrong, But the one thing I’ve done wrong, Oh the one thing I’ve done wrong, Lord, You know I’ve stayed in the valley too long.   Subscribe now6 Issues for $6 Subscribe In This Story: Politics Share Tweet Add a Comment Tweet Subscribe Now6 Issues for $6 Subscribe Recommended For You __title__ __category__ __title__ __category__ Vogue Fashion Runway Beauty Culture Living Magazine City Guides Videos Subscribe VOGUE VIP Vogue App Vogue Shop Promotions Vogue Archive Vogue Podcast Log In | Register Log Out Facebook Twitter Google+ Pinterest Instagram Sign up for Newsletter Contact Press Subscriptions Digital Editions Vogue Worldwide UK India Italy Mexico Australia Germany Korea Spain Taiwan Russia France Brazil Japan Portugal Ukraine Turkey China Reprints/Permissions Media Kits Careers Condé Nast Digital Allure Architectural Digest Ars Technica Backchannel Bon Appétit Brides.com Condé Nast Traveler Epicurious Glamour Golf Digest Golf World GQ GQ Style Pitchfork Self Teen Vogue The New Yorker The Scene Vanity Fair Vogue W Wired Magazine Customer Service Sitemap © 2017 Condé Nast.

Raising further questions about privacy on the internet, researchers from Princeton and Stanford universities have released a study showing that a specific person’s online behavior can be identified by linking anonymous Web browsing histories with social media profiles. “We show that browsing histories can be linked to social media profiles such as Twitter, Facebook, or Reddit accounts,” the researchers wrote in a paper scheduled for presentation at the 2017 World Wide Web Conference Perth, Australia, in April. “It is already known that some companies, such as Google and Facebook, track users online and know their identities,” said Arvind Narayanan, an assistant professor of computer science at Princeton and one of the authors of the research article. But those companies, which consumers choose to create accounts with, disclose their tracking. The new research shows that anyone with access to browsing histories — a great number of companies and organizations —can identify many users by analyzing public information from social media accounts, Narayanan said. “Users may assume they are anonymous when they are browsing a news or a health Website, but our work adds to the list of ways in which tracking companies may be able to learn their identities,” said Narayanan, an affiliated faculty member at Princeton’s Center for Information Technology Policy. Narayanan noted that the Federal Communications Commission recently adopted privacy rules for internet service providers that allow them to store and use consumer information only when it is “not reasonably linkable” to individual users. “Our results suggest that pseudonymous browsing histories fail this test,” the researchers wrote. Princeton University’s Engineering School notes that in the article, the authors note that online advertising companies build browsing histories of users with tracking programs embedded on Webpages. Some advertisers attach identities to these profiles, but most promise that the Web browsing information is not linked to anyone’s identity. The researchers wanted to know if it were possible to de-anonymize Web browsing and identify a user even if the Web browsing history did not include identities. They decided to limit themselves to publicly available information. Social media profiles, particularly those that include links to outside Webpages, offered the strongest possibility. The researchers created an algorithm to compare anonymous Web browsing histories with links appearing in people’s public social media accounts, called “feeds.” “Each person’s browsing history is unique and contains tell-tale signs of their identity,” said Sharad Goel, an assistant professor at Stanford and an author of the study. The programs were able to find patterns among the different groups of data and use those patterns to identify users. The researchers note that the method is not perfect, and it requires a social media feed that includes a number of links to outside sites. However, they said that “given a history with 30 links originating from Twitter, we can deduce the corresponding Twitter profile more than 50 percent of the time.” The researchers had even greater success in an experiment they ran involving 374 volunteers who submitted Web browsing information. The researchers were able to identify more than 70 percent of those users by comparing their Web browsing data to hundreds of millions of public social media feeds. (The number of original participants in the study was higher, but some users were eliminated because of technical problems in processing their information.) Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye, an assistant professor at Imperial College London, said the research shows how “easy it is to build a full-scale ‘de-anonymizationer’ that needs nothing more than what’s available to anyone who knows how to code.” “All the evidence we have seen piling up over the years showing the strong limits of data anonymization, including this study, really emphasizes the need to rethink our approach to privacy and data protection in the age of big data,” said de Montjoye, who was not involved in the project.

Although the company continued to make money hand over fist, 2016 marked the first time Apple experienced a year-over-year decline in iPhone sales. On top of that, Apple’s new MacBook Pro lineup elicited an onslaught of criticism from folks who viewed the device as underpowered and embarrassingly overpriced. Don't Miss: You won’t believe how much Amazon is charging for Google’s Pixel XL But if we smash through some of the hyperbole and dire projections about Apple’s ability to innovate, we find that Apple still has a knack for delivering products and services that keep consumers coming back for more. According to Brand Keys’ 2017 Customer Loyalty Engagement Index, Apple delivers a best in class user experience across every single category in which it competes, from smartphones to music streaming. CNET reports: When it comes to the smartphone category, the top driver is Apple. In tablets, it’s Apple. In laptop computers, it’s Apple. Yes, this despite the launch of the somewhat deflating MacBook Pro. What about online music? Goodness me, it’s isn’t Spotify. It’s Apple Music. Even in the headphones product category, Apple-owned Beats ties with LG as the category driver. Can it be that at a time when Apple is subject to criticism from seemingly all sides, it’s still the most emotionally involving, customer-pleasing brand of all? Brand Keys’ latest study provides a good opportunity to point out the dangers in getting swept away in the hive mind mentality that tends to hover over Apple. If you didn’t know any better, you might reasonably assume that the new MacBook Pro, for example, was nothing short of a flop. In reality, Apple’s revamped MacBook Pro has proven to be extremely popular with consumers, with Phil Schiller even stating this past November that Apple’s “online store has had more orders for the new MacBook Pro than any other pro notebook before.” It’s easy to get bogged down in sales figures and pessimistic diatribes about how Apple’s best days are behind it, but it’s important to remember that when it comes to providing users with an intuitive and enjoyable user experience, Apple still knows how to deliver.

We spoke to Ankur Singla, founder and chief executive officer, Tapzo, about it. What would a guy do if he had to recharge his girlfriend's mobile phone, check the cricket score, read his horoscope for the day and book for a cab for his boss; all at the same time from his smartphone? Of course, he'd use different apps. But switching between apps would just slow him down. Enter Tapzo, the all-in-one app that aggregates multiple categories of apps into one comprehensive platform; giving consumers access to 35+ applications without having to download any of them. Currently, partners such as, Uber, Ola, Swiggy, Zomato, Nearbuy and others are part of Tapzo. In this day and age, users are spoilt for choice with multiple apps offering discounts and cashback offers. We asked Ankur Singla, founder and chief executive officer, Tapzo, how different his app is going to be? He says, "We are a platform where external apps integrate with ours and the user can use the discounts offered by the main app on our app. If one has an Uber coupon you could apply it on our app and avail the discount." However, if the user has booked an Ola or Uber cab through Tapzo, the user might be able to avail the offers either from Tapzo or the ride-sharing service; or from both. Singla adds, "If a consumer gets cashback from us, it will get transferred to Tapzo Cash (eWallet) and at the same time if he gets cashback from Ola or Uber, it will go directly to his Ola Money or Paytm." If one has the individual apps (Ola and Uber), you can actually compare the prices and then make a selection. But Tapzo, as an app, doesn't let one compare the ride rates. Singla says, "Yes, currently we are not showing the comparisons between the Ola and Uber pricing and that's a limitation." We asked Singla the criteria for apps to be a part of Tapzo. He answers, "We take a close look at the daily life of our users and try to incorporate all those on our app." Adding onto Tapzo's list of benefits, he says, "People are always running out of storage on their smartphone. Whether it is a low budget or high budget smartphone. Most of the apps end up competing with Whatsapp that takes the most space due to videos or photos. The user is in an unequal dilemma of either getting rid of Whatapp or some other apps. With Tapzo, he doesn't need to make that choice." To promote the app, Tapzo has come up with three TV ads conceptualised by BBH India. The ads trace real life situations where people only need one app to address all their daily needs. The film's protagonists are known faces from the digital world, including YouTube actor Bhuvan Bam (BB Ki Vines), Amol Parashar (TVF Tripling) and Naveen Kasturia (TVF Pitchers). Apart from the TVCs, the brand is also promoting its campaign through YouTube, Google, Facebook and radio. The core TG for the brand is male, 22-30 year olds, living in the top 10 cities of India with an income level ranging from Rs 25,000 to Rs 1,00,000 per month. Speaking about the campaign, Russell Barrett, managing partner and chief creative officer, BBH India, says in a press release, "Our idea reflects how a random observation can sometimes trigger a memory of something we've obviously forgotten to do. Tapzo, actually allows us to solve life's little problems before they become big ones. The 'stream of consciousness' approach to the films was chosen to reflect the meandering of a mind in a humorous, yet real way. We had a great team working on this project led by Sippy (our brilliant director), the hugely talented cast (made up of famous YouTubers) and the BBH teams led creatively by Sapna and Yohan." Tapzo belongs to a young segment of brands that are inherently intangible, mobile-first and driven by technology. When it comes to advertising these products on mass media, should the creative agency apply rules different to that applicable to FMCG or apparel products? Our digital expert answers... Akshat Bhardwaj, creative director, DigitasLBi India, says, "In advertising, as long as the product benefit is showcased strongly enough to persuade the user to take the right decision, the job gets done. With these ads, Tapzo has done exactly that, and I don't believe that the intangibility of the brand (or any other tech driven mobile service) will change that. Having said that, I believe that good use of the digital space can take this thought beyond videos." He adds, "Every now and then, something or the other reminds us of things that need to be done. Tapzo has seamlessly tapped into this insight, and as a result, brought us a fun showcase of its use case scenarios. It'll now be interesting to see how this showcase can be brought alive using the digital space. For example, starting with a search based video response campaign on YouTube would be damn cool. It would give this thought a much more inclusive dimension and enhance the brands value in the eyes of the consumer." 28SHARES Follow Suraj Ramnath Search Tags Tapzo BBH TVF Ankur Singla Russell Barrett Related Articles Akosha is now Helpchat, a personal assistant app Digital Guest Article: Ankur Singla: Three practical ramifications of overlap of marketing and customer service Marketing Guest Article: Ankur Singla: 7 trends that will change customer experience in India Marketing Akosha.com: Creating a Better Customer Experience for Brands Digital Stay Updated with Us Top 10 Stories Last Week Last Month Last Year Maruti Suzuki positions 'Alto' as a car 'Made for ...

Fancy, Glorious Coffee Reminder: Double Demerit Points This Australia Day Weekend Thinking Cap: Podcasts, Articles And Clips To Make You Smarter Alan Henry Jan 21, 2017, 11:00am ⋅ Filed to:  clips geography learning media science thinking cap Share This week we're checking out what it takes to produce zero waste for 30 days, learning how criminals actually steal passwords, looking at where nuclear weapons live around the globe and talking about jobs with the best perks. Welcome to Lifehacker's Thinking Cap, a series where we round up interesting, informative and thought-provoking podcasts, interviews, articles and other media that will teach you something new, inspire you and hopefully cap off your week nicely. How Hackers Really Steal Your Passwords With the exception of social engineering, which is a very convenient way to steal credentials, most passwords aren't stolen by simple dictionary attacks or super complicated cracking. In fact, it's much easier than you think, especially when databases that aren't properly salted and hashed are concerned. This video from DNews explains how evildoers really get their hands on your passwords, and how you're especially vulnerable if you're using uncomplicated passwords, popular ones that everyone uses or easily guessed passwords. In reality, once someone gets their hand on a password database, they just check it for already hashed passwords that are known and long decrypted. So a password like "password123" or even "passWord123!" already have well-known hashes, and if that hash is found in the database, that's a cracked account for the taking, no brute forcing required. Of course, salting and hashing password databases is the solution here, but the video goes into more detail. Check it out - and then go change your password to something you don't know. And get a good password manager while you're at it. [via DNews (YouTube)] Have You Ever Taken a Job Just for the Perks? If you're lucky enough to have a job with perks, odds are they're something simple, like free coffee in the kitchen and maybe an employee discount program with some select retailers or something. But this thread at Quora offers up an interesting question: Have you ever taken a job just for the perks? I mean, some jobs have great perks - Google is kind of famous for this, with their sprawling campus packed with food and snack shops that cater to all kinds, and on-campus recreation and exercise facilities, all for free to employees (and in some cases, their families). Or maybe getting a job at a stadium just to see your favourite team play for free, or an arena just to get access to the concerts. Of course, many perks are designed to keep you at work as much as possible, but there's no denying the perks are lovely. This answer in the thread gave me a chuckle: Growing up in Italy, my husband loved bread so much he was literally leaving none left for the family's dinner. In Italy the bread is bought fresh every morning for the day's lunch and dinner. So my mother-in-law sent him to work as a delivery boy for the local baker. Problem solved! To this day he loves nothing more than a few slices of salami on some good Italian ciabatta bread. But the question remains. What about you? Have you ever taken a job just for the perks it offered, even if those perks were minimal? [via Quora] Could You Make Zero Trash for 30 Days? Considering the average Australian produces about two tonnes of garbage annually, it's a pretty big challenge to try and produce zero for 30 days, but Buzzfeed's Auri Jackson tried, and learned a lot along the way. She learned how to adapt; what the stakes are if we don't start recycling, reusing and repurposing more of the things we bring home and otherwise just toss in the garbage; and she also learned how much of a privilege in itself it was to even try the challenge, since most affordable and accessible foods come in packaging, but things like fresh produce come in no packaging, but is more expensive. The full five minute video of her challenge is fun and entertaining to watch, but it's also a bit of an eye opener, and kind of runs counter to the whole "one person really can't make a difference" mentality that's so prevalent right now. After all, all we have is ourselves to make a difference with. [via Buzzfeed (YouTube), thanks Boing Boing!] How Close You Live to a Nuclear Bomb So, how close do you live to a nuclear bomb? Well, if you live in the southern hemisphere, congratulations, you're probably pretty far from one. It's a good time to be Australian. But considering 80 per cent of the human population on Earth lives in the northern hemisphere, well, odds are you're relatively close to one, especially if you're reading this from inside the United States, in Europe or somewhere in Russia. This video, from Real Life Lore, outlines where many countries tend to keep their nuclear weapons and silos, and that's just on land, and on top of that, what's public information. It's also worth keeping in mind that many countries keep a substantial number of nuclear weapons on submarines and other launch platforms at sea, in classified locations. Bottom line though, depending on where you live, you're either very close — mostly if you live in Europe or western Russia, or substantially farther, like in the United States. That all said though, it's less whether you live close to one now and whether you live near a city on a nuclear target list, right? [via RealLifeLore (YouTube)] A Live Eagle Cam from Southwest Florida How about some beautiful birds to finish your week? This live camera of a bald eagle nest in southwest Florida is a joy to keep up in a side window or a picture-in-picture view, and just chill enough to be relaxing and non-distracting, but still offer you a little interest to keep an eye on from time to time. Super chill, and plus, there's a new baby bird in the family. Stream it from YouTube above, or check out some alternate cams and information about the birds and their feeding times over at the Eagle Cam homepage. Have a great weekend!

Image: brittany herbert/mashable By Patrick Kulp2017-01-19 19:11:30 UTC Snapchat ads are about to get much more personal. Snap, the company behind the ephemeral image sharing app, will begin letting advertisers use offline sales data like store purchases and loyalty rewards programs to better tailor ads to individual users. The move follows in the footsteps of bigger rivals like Facebook and Google, which have built behemoth ad businesses around their ability to target with pinpoint precision. Both have agreed to similar partnerships with Oracle Data Cloud. Snap had previously long resisted these kinds of tactics; CEO Evan Spiegel famously promised to avoid "creepy" tracking and targeting two years ago. But pressure from advertisers and heated competition has forced the company to ease up on that stance. The company will partner with Orcale to use anonymized email addresses and mobile IDs to match information with Snapchat's own user base. SEE ALSO: Meet the new adult at Snap: Sony exec Michael Lynton moves full time to Snapchat Kia, STX Entertainment and The Honest Company are among the first brands to test the new capabilities. Last fall, Snapchat rolled out a host of new tools that let advertisers target around email address and other identifiers specific to a user's phone and their behavior within the app.  Snap has also made deals with several third-party measurement firms to provide brands with more comprehensive data on how their ads are being viewed.  The move comes as the company is reportedly looking to beef up revenues in preparation for a public offering.

In other words, a good target for a startup. Tech companies of all sizes have tried to fix medical records management, help patients find doctors more easily, or help people access drugs. Often, though, health-care startups don’t live up to the hype. The belief that startups can transform businesses and industries of all kinds — for the better — is what we’ll be exploring in Ventures, a new video series from Bloomberg Technology. This month, we’re focusing on Forward, a startup that reimagines a doctor’s office. It uses technology to do everything from drawing your blood to taking your pulse to recording your conversations with your doctor. Most health-care startups try to fix things by spreading software across the analogue parts of the medical industry. For Forward, founder Adrian Aoun is ditching that approach in favour of engineering a doctor’s office from scratch. Forward doesn’t replace your health insurance. Instead, members pay a steep US$149 (RM662) per month to have unlimited access to Forward’s primary care services and its first office — a gleaming lobby in San Francisco’s Financial District full of body scanners and infrared vein finders. Forward hopes that by making it easier and more pleasant to see a doctor, patients will do it more often — and catch expensive health issues like cancer and heart disease earlier. Aoun sold an earlier startup, Wavii, to Google in 2013 and stayed on as an executive for several years. For Forward, he’s recruited his former lieutenant at Google, Erik Frey, and an early Uber employee, Ilya Abyzov. His time at Google taught him to think about problems in a big way, not incrementally, he said. “One big lesson was to not just think about problems from the perspective of where a piece of software can fit into an existing system, but actually to start looking at things systemically,” he said. “Don’t start from the bottom. Start from the top.” ― Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Battle of the digital butlers: Alexa takes on Siri (VIDEO) Apple joins group devoted to keeping AI nice In move to Facebook, Barra leaves unfinished expansion at Xiaomi 'Ace Combat 7' expands horizons on PC, Xbox One, PS4 (VIDEO) Telling the mind what to do through direct brain stimulation (VIDEO) Samsung confirms battery defects caused Note 7 fires (VIDEO) Samsung Galaxy S8 rumours: Smaller case, more screen real estate Arrow 3: Israel's killer missile can strike targets in outer space (VIDEO) This startup is making the doctor’s office of the future (VIDEO) Panasonic launches washing machine for curry stains in India Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: Alexa versus Siri Reutes Video: Miss Universe’s preliminary show starts in Manila Reuters Video: Ryan Gosling brings ‘La La Land’ to Tokyo Reuters Video: Mexicans build makeshift wall around US embassy in Trump protest Reuters Video: President Trump, Melania share 'first dance' Reuters Video: Marketing experts on how best to spend money, time, energy in 2017 Related Articles How to prevent whiplash from ever-changing medical advice Microsoft, Dell, Salesforce start buying into WeWork offices New crop of robots to vie for space in the operating room Micro-camera can be injected with a syringe Guardant’s new cancer blood test matches tissue biopsies in trial (VIDEO) Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

He did so after a threat from the National Consumer Commission. In 1908, Henry Ford invented the motorcar with the laconic assurance that buyers could have it in “any colour as long as it is black”. A century later, this macho indifference to the customer clearly still permeates the local subsidiary that bears his name. Ford SA has found itself at the centre of a firestorm over its tardiness in reacting to its Kuga SUV spontaneously self-combusting. There have been 40-50 incidents of Kugas bursting into flames in less than a year, with one death and several narrow escapes. Ford’s response to this was pathetic, characterised by obfuscation and misrepresentation. It took a year before Ford asked Kuga owners to take their vehicles for a safety inspection. But even then, after dealerships had checked and pronounced a vehicle safe, some were still going up in flames. It was only this week that Ford issued a recall for the 4 556 1.6-litre Kuga SUVs built between 2012 and 2014. It ascribes the fires to engine overheating, following a coolant circulation failure. Obviously, this is not good for Ford’s reputation. It is, however, not simply a problem of bad marketing, tin-eared public relations, or cack-handed branding, as has been suggested by the experts. What it is, is additional evidence of a corporate malaise, of companies so cloaked in arrogance, so disdainful of the “little people” who buy their products and consume their services, that they really couldn’t give a stuff. ALSO READ: Cape Town mayor needs to see the slums for the trees There will, of course, be a dip in Ford sales locally, since presumably not many new buyers want a mobile crematorium that unpredictably immolates its occupants. But no matter how much one would like to believe in the idiom that as you sow, so shall you reap, this is likely to be only a momentary setback for Ford. After all, there are not many alternatives for would-be buyers. The motor industry, world wide, is riddled with corruption and a willingness to dice with the lives of its clients. Locally, when asked why it had taken so long to issue the recall, Ford SA’s CEO Jeff Nemeth said the company had been trying to understand what was going on. What arrant rubbish. Nemeth is either a cynical liar or simply too dumb to retain as top honcho of anything more challenging than Honest Jeff’s Pre-owned Cars. Perhaps Nemeth should have had one of his minions Google the problem. He would discover that the 1.6-litre Kuga is the equivalent model of US Ford’s 1.6-litre Escape, which has been subject to several recalls in recent years, including one in 2012 for the same engine fire problem. Nemeth’s belated decision to recall the Kuga – appositely for something no one any longer wants to touch, kuga is a Slovenian word for the plague – was not prompted by altruism or ethics. He did so because the National Consumer Commission (NCC) issued Ford with an ultimatum: initiate a “voluntary” safety recall or the NCC would order one. The NCC should take a bow for intervening firmly. This is a rare victory for the so-called oversight bodies that litter the SA landscape but mostly seem to be too chummy with the entities that they are supposed to control to be of any use.

A Tokyo District Court ordered the seer to pay $815,000 worth of damages to the victim. Tokyo's Judge Sotaro Tomuro ruled earlier this week that a woman psychic was able to control the mind of another female forcing her to work in the sex industry. Working as a prostitute the victim was forced to surrender over 100 million yen ($815,000) to the clairvoyant, local media reported. Read more Man attacks a fortune teller who predicted he’d serve time in prison The story began unfolding in 2008 when the victim started consulting with the fortuneteller over the phone to deal with divorce issues. Over time the conversations grew more frequent and the victim, who by this time had so much faith in the oracle, moved into an apartment run by the fortuneteller. That same year, in 2011, the victim started working in a brothel until leaving the trade in 2013. During the trial, where the plaintiff sought 100 million yen worth in damages, the woman claimed that once she moved into the apartment the fortune-teller started to "mind-control me" by saying things like: "‘You can’t make sound judgments because of marijuana you smoked in the past. You must do as I say,’ and ‘If you do as I say, things will go well with the man you like,’” the Tokyo Reporter reported quoting case material. “I was ordered to work at a brothel, and was also told to provide back-room services, such as ‘honban,’” the victim said, using the term that refers to actual sexual intercourse. “I handed over all my money. I gave over 100 million yen.” The defense team for the fortune teller claimed that her so-called client was "bad with money," and that she would mishandle it by eating "14 persons’ worth of food in one sitting." The seer claimed that she did not control the mind of the victim and that 100 million yen received from the brothel worker were "unpaid fortunetelling fees."

Judge Tomuro also said that the fortuneteller "controlled her [ the victim] as she wished" and "forced" her to surrender large sums of money to her. "The woman had fallen into a state where her personality was essentially lost," Judge Tomuro said, awarding the victim the full amount sought in damages.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    President Donald Trump has reportedly picked a fierce critic of the Obama-era "net neutrality" rules to be chief regulator of the nation's airwaves and internet connections. Citing unidentified people, Bloomberg and Politico both reported Friday that the next chairman of the Federal Communications Commission will be Ajit Pai, an old hand at the agency. Pai's chief of staff, Matthew Berry, declined to comment. Neither Trump administration spokesman Bryan Lanza nor FCC spokesmen immediately replied to requests for comment. Pai is one of the two Republican commissioners on a 5-member panel that regulates the country's communications infrastructure, including TV, phone and internet service. The Republicans' FCC majority would help them roll back pro-consumer policies that upset many phone and cable industry groups, including net neutrality rules that bar internet service providers from favoring some websites and apps over others. AN INDUSTRY-FRIENDLY FCC Pai has long maintained that the FCC under former chairman Thomas Wheeler had overstepped its bounds, suggesting that he would steer the agency in a direction more favorable to big phone and cable companies. In a December speech, he expressed confidence that the 2015 net neutrality rules would be undone and said the FCC needed to take a "weed whacker" to what he considered unnecessary regulations that hold back investment and innovation. Consumer advocates have been concerned that a deregulation-minded FCC could potentially allow more huge mergers, overturn new protections for internet users and lead to higher costs for media and technology companies that rely on the internet to reach consumers. Pai opposed online privacy regulations that force broadband providers to ask consumers for permission before using their data, saying they are more onerous than the requirements for internet companies like Google and Facebook. He voted against approving Charter Communication's $67 billion takeover of Time Warner Cable and a smaller company, Bright House — not because he opposed the merger, but because he thought some of the conditions required by the FCC, like barring data caps on home internet service, amounted to government meddling in business. PAI VS. THE ZERO RATING Pai also criticized an FCC report on "zero rating" earlier this month, characterizing it as a meaningless document that won't influence the FCC under Trump. The report, issued in the last days of the Obama administration, took issue with the way companies like AT&T and Verizon exempted their own video services from wireless data caps, effectively making them cheaper to stream on phones and tablets than rival services such as Netflix. Future big media and telecom mergers may get a friendlier review under a Pai-led FCC. Pai voted to approve AT&T's 2015 acquisition of DirecTV. And while he told the Wall Street Journal in December 2013 that the Obama administration was likely to oppose Comcast's failed effort to acquire Time Warner Cable — he was right — he added that a Republican administration would be more likely to approve it. The FCC currently has a 2-1 Republican majority and two empty seats, which will be filled by one Republican and one Democrat. Pai, an Indian-American from Kansas, has been an FCC commissioner since 2012. During his roughly 15 years in government, he's been a Senate staffer and worked at the FCC and the Justice Department. He was also a lawyer for Verizon and an attorney at the law firm Jenner & Block. © Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Sony Xperia XZ, X Performance receive Nougat with January security patch By Rei Padla - January 20, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter The Sony Xperia XZ and X Performance will receive the Android Nougat OS update before the company announces a new flagship phone at next month’s Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain. Well, we’re not sure if it will be a premium flagship or a mid-range flagship but Sony has already invited the press to a special launch event. Before that happens, expect software updates to be released so at least we’ll have more time to think if it’s already the right time to buy a new device. Sony has shared the good news that the Xperia Z5 family will receive Android Nougat. The Sony Xperia X Concept received the latest Android 7.1.1. Other devices also ready for the Nougat update include the Xperia X, X Dual, and X Compact. Last month, we also heard Rogers would be rolling out the OS update for the X Performance. A new firmware update has just been released by Sony for the Xperia X Performance and Xperia XZ. Included are the Dual-SIM variants who are getting the new 39.2.A.0.386 build from the previous 39.2.A.0.374. This one is important because the update includes the January 2017 Google security patches that would fix minor issues. One notable update should be the phone clock resetting after every reboot. That normally happens for some phones but it can be inconvenient for those in school already. If you own an Xperia XZ and Xperia X Performance, be prepared to received an OTA alert or notification anytime soon.

Today it's taken another step forward with support for 360-degree videos on YouTube. That means you can boot up anything on the platform, including a New York Times'Daily 360' video, and move your head to change the perspective. You're stuck in one place, of course, but the experience is still fairly immersive, especially in comparison to the desktop YouTube experience (dragging around with your cursor isn't much fun).

A handful of early PSVR owners received the update last December, but said the quality of the service was poor. That's because the videos were capped at 1080p and had to be stretched to accommodate the headset's 100-degree field of view. We're hoping that Sony and Google have worked out the kinks -- a huge library of immersive 360 videos would make PSVR a more useful and attractive proposition. If nothing else, it'll tide us over while developers work on new VR games, like the much anticipated Resident Evil 7.

She tweets her thoughts at @sfqomhz and occasionally writes extremely long articles on sfqomhz.wordpress.com. JANUARY 21 — Recently, 54 unmarried couples were nabbed in Terengganu by JHEAT for riding on motorbikes. JHEAT Commissioner Datuk Wan Mohd Wan Ibrahim advised unmarried couples “to refrain from sitting closely (on the motorbike) as such an act could lead to acts such as sexual intercourse and having children out of wedlock.” Even more recently, after being under media spotlight over this, JHEAT took the issue further by saying they may “catch” unmarried couples in cars too. We have always known that Malaysian Islamic authorities have a weird way of dealing with sex, but I’m quite convinced that this way of keeping men and women apart is an ineffective way of preventing societal ills like baby dumping and unwanted pregnancies. In fact, this method doesn’t seem to make things any better albeit it might even be making things worse. Last September, netizens went into a frenzy regarding a particular “condom” question in a PT3 examination paper. A lot of people were upset that the student’s answer was marked wrong, but there were also those who were enraged by the fact that whoever wrote the question paper had the audacity to ask about condoms. PIBGN president Prof Madya Datuk Dr Mohamad Ali Hassan said that the question was unsuitable for 15-year-olds as it will encourage kids to go online and search for information on condoms. Oh dear! God forbid that children learn about contraception! All joking aside, I honestly believe it is high time that we take sex education seriously in this country, especially among the Muslims. Most opposition to sex education is on the assumption that knowledge is harmful; that if you enlighten kids concerning sex, they will go out and do it. However, all it takes is a simple Google search or observation of our surroundings to reveal that ignorance and unresolved curiosity — not knowledge — is harmful. Our resistance to telling kids what they want and need to know is one of the main reasons why we still have high numbers of unwanted pregnancies and baby dumping cases from year to year. The main reason teachers and parents care not to discuss sex education comprehensively is because of their cultural upbringing, not religion, because in Islam, “sex” is not a dirty word. In fact, it is an important aspect of our lives. Sex education is not about giving youngsters permission to have sex, but it is about teaching them about the human body, about reproduction, hazards of unsafe sex, and unwanted pregnancies. Not only that, but it also concentrates on the mental, emotional, and social aspects of puberty. We might not be able to stop people from having sex, but at least we can decrease the number of individuals affected by sexually transmitted diseases and the number of babies getting thrown away by irresponsible adolescents. Everyone has a role to play when it comes to sex education. It is not just the job of teachers in school, but also peers and especially parents wherein their responsibility is mainly in the form of reinforcing social, moral, and religious ethics into the child. Our culture of beating around the bush when it comes to sex will birth, and has birthed, an army of adults who deem “sex” as a taboo subject, thus passing this on to their children, who in turn pass it on to theirs. We have to stop thinking that instilling religious fear into people will “protect” them from having sex. Nothing will stop people from having sex, not even the heavier punishments of RUU355; teaching and encouraging safe sex will work much better in decreasing unwanted pregnancies, sexually transmitted diseases, and baby dumping. Even though there is still much to be discussed about how we are going to tackle sex education with a fresh perspective, I believe that a good first step is by getting rid of the stigma that surrounds the act of sex. How about it, Malaysia? Are we ready to talk about sex? ** This is the personal opinion of the columnist.                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Want the best competition?

By TALI ARBEL The Associated Press First Published Jan 20 2017 05:21PM    •    Last Updated Jan 20 2017 05:21 pm Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) New York • President Donald Trump has reportedly picked a fierce critic of the Obama-era "net neutrality" rules to be chief regulator of the nation's airwaves and internet connections. Citing unidentified people, Bloomberg and Politico both reported Friday that the next chairman of the Federal Communications Commission will be Ajit Pai, an old hand at the agency. Pai's chief of staff, Matthew Berry, declined to comment. Neither Trump administration spokesman Bryan Lanza nor FCC spokesmen immediately replied to requests for comment. Pai is one of the two Republican commissioners on a 5-member panel that regulates the country's communications infrastructure, including TV, phone and internet service. VIDEOS TOP JOBS The Republicans' FCC majority would help them roll back pro-consumer policies that upset many phone and cable industry groups, including net neutrality rules that bar internet service providers from favoring some websites and apps over others. AN INDUSTRY-FRIENDLY FCC Pai has long maintained that the FCC under former chairman Thomas Wheeler had overstepped its bounds, suggesting that he would steer the agency in a direction more favorable to big phone and cable companies. In a December speech, he expressed confidence that the 2015 net neutrality rules would be undone and said the FCC needed to take a "weed whacker" to what he considered unnecessary regulations that hold back investment and innovation. Consumer advocates have been concerned that a deregulation-minded FCC could potentially allow more huge mergers, overturn new protections for internet users and lead to higher costs for media and technology companies that rely on the internet to reach consumers.

He voted against approving Charter Communication's $67 billion takeover of Time Warner Cable and a smaller company, Bright House — not because he opposed the merger, but because he thought some of the conditions required by the FCC, like barring data caps on home internet service, amounted to government meddling in business.

Arlen Redekop/PNG files Arlen Redekop / PNG Share Adjust Comment Print Young people today may be known as “digital natives,” but just because they were born in a certain generation doesn’t necessarily mean they have the skills to use technology to its greatest potential, a University of B.C. researcher says.  Ron Darvin, PhD candidate, researcher and lecturer in UBC’s faculty of education on language and literacy, says digital literacy includes many components and not all students are maximizing their potential.  “Digital literacy is truly being able to harness the power of technology, in terms of the different components, whether it be being able to acquire knowledge, to connect and develop social networks through social media and also as a form of entertainment,” Darvin said. “There is also the way we represent identities — the way we are able to take selfies or represent ourselves on Facebook is another form of digital literacy as well.” He says parents and teachers have to challenge the idea that digital literacy comes naturally to kids, simply because they’re adept with Facebook or Snapchat.   “I’m sure you’ve heard that the Oxford Dictionary word of the year last year was post-truth,” Darvin said. “We live in an age where truth is so malleable. The thing with the Internet is that so many people can publish things online and they present it as the truth. Match that with the power of social media to disseminate information. “It’s so easy, within a matter of seconds, for things that aren’t entirely true to go straight into your Facebook newsfeed, and without that critical lens, our kids will not be learning to sift through all these and find what legitimate knowledge is.”    The best thing parents can do to raise kids who are digitally literate is to become digitally literate themselves and talk about it often with their kids. He recommends adults learn things like how Facebook and Google algorithms work — how the technology companies’ websites determine what results will show up in what order or what a newsfeed will show.  “Parents can cultivate a home environment where kids can see technology not only as a form of entertainment, but a source of knowledge,” Darvin said.  A new curriculum, based on concepts rather than specific topics, is being introduced in schools across B.C. and Darvin said digital literacy will be key to student success.  “If we look at new curriculum in B.C., it talks about an inquiry-based approach. We really want our kids to be able to solve real-world problems and to be able to integrate across different disciplines. We want our students to be able to … find and create knowledge on their own,” Darvin said.   He would like to see a more methodical approach to teaching digital literacy in schools.  “When we integrate technology into a classroom, I think there has to be a more systematic approach to it, so we know exactly what to expect from students at specific grade levels, so that we know they’re developing these digital literacies and we know who is responsible for teaching that,” Darvin said.   Darvin will be speaking at Engaging Education for the Public Good at 6:30 p.m. on Jan. 26 at the UBC Learning Exchange, 612 Main St., Vancouver.  tsherlock@postmedia.com CLICK HERE to report a typo.

Search Watch Live Home UK Brexit World Business Politics Technology Entertainment Strange News Weather How will the Trump presidency affect world affairs? Donald Trump is set to be among the most controversial presidents in US history. So how will he tackle some of the biggest issues facing the world, including conflicts in the Middle East, Brexit and China's increasing influence? Sky's editors and correspondents offer their insight. Foreign Affairs By Sam Kiley, Foreign Affairs Editor Donald Trump has shown "a fine disregard for the rules of the game" in international affairs. But while William Webb Ellis turned football into rugby, Mr Trump's tear-it-up-and-start-again doctrine threatens to turn the planet into a gladiatorial free-for-all. A Darwinian and dark dystopia. He has signalled contempt for international law when it comes to Israel's illegal Jewish settlements. He has signalled admiration for Vladimir Putin, who has illegally annexed the Crimea and continues to destabilise Ukraine and Georgia. Mr Trump's tear-it-up and start again doctrine threatens to turn the planet into a gladiatorial free-for-all. A Darwinian and dark dystopia. Sam Kiley He has no truck with complex international trade deals with China, Mexico or Canada. Britain's choice, and one it must make now, is whether to join in his dangerous adventure into chaos, or stick with the structures that have ensured peace for more than half a century. Russia and NATO By Dominic Waghorn, Diplomatic Correspondent Americans have long been proud of the peaceful transition of power at the heart of their political system. They believe their form of government is not only the best way of running their own country, but also an example to the world. That belief has taken quite a knock this year, with an election tainted by scandal that has undermined the standing of western democracy. Video: 'Not you! You are fake news' Trump tells reporter Questions linger about the impact of Russian hacking on the electoral process, and the suspicion remains that Mr Trump has somehow been personally compromised by Russian intelligence. Ethics experts and officials say his failure to produce tax returns is unacceptable and his attempts to remove himself from his businesses inadequate. The Trump transition process is causing deep concerns because of differences between the President-elect and the people he wants in his cabinet, particularly on how to handle Russia. While he talks of striking a bargain with Vladimir Putin, his nominees say the Russian leader is trying to break NATO and may need to be confronted. Traditionally, incoming presidents reassure friends and unsettle potential enemies. Donald Trump has upended the foreign policy playbook by doing the opposite. Dominic Waghorn Anthony Arend, professor of government and foreign service at Georgetown University, told Sky News that this is unprecedented and potentially dangerous. "It confuses the allies and I would say also emboldens our adversaries if there seems to be some kind of confusion about what's going on in the United States - the cabinet's saying one thing, the President is saying something else and Congress is moving in a different direction. "That's a perfect opportunity for Putin to take advantage of that and undertake some kind of adventurous activity." On the campaign trail and in recent interviews, Mr Trump has caused deep concern by calling NATO obsolete, writing off the EU and disparaging close allies. Traditionally, incoming presidents reassure friends and unsettle potential enemies. Donald Trump has upended the foreign policy playbook by doing the opposite. Professor Daniel Nexon, foreign relations scholar, says that is deeply worrying. He said: "I don't think I've ever had so much personal anxiety about the fate of basic institutions that have served the United States and its allies extremely well since the end of the Second World War and certainly since the end of the Cold War." The Middle East By Alex Rossi, Middle East Correspondent Donald Trump, the star of TV's the Apprentice and business guru extraordinaire - according to his own press - is now the Commander-in-Chief of the most powerful nation on Earth. But a nation is only powerful if that power is expressed. So what will Mr Trump's foreign policy be in the Middle East? He has alienated millions of people before he has even started. Alex Rossi Well, his policies (if you can call them that) are inchoate and he has no experience of foreign affairs, or indeed politics, so it is hard to predict. Overall he has suggested the US will no longer spend its taxpayers' cash on being the world's policeman. So, in the Middle East and elsewhere, the US is likely, if he stays true to his word, to take a more isolationist approach. I'm not sure if Mr Trump knows but there are a lot of Muslims in the Middle East. His comments about Muslims in the campaign period have not gone down well. In fact it is safe to say he has alienated millions of people before he has even started. Mr Trump has suggested Islamic State will be a priority. Again, it is hard to know what he will do differently. US boots on the ground in large numbers would be a departure from Mr Obama's policy. Mr Trump has suggested IS will be a priority. US boots on the ground in large numbers would be a departure from Mr Obama's policy. Alex Rossi In all likelihood his approach will probably involve greater cooperation with Russia. This, in itself, will be fairly revolutionary. Co-operation with the Kremlin against IS in Syria means the US will effectively be fighting on the same side as President Bashar al Assad - a man the Obama administration accused of war crimes and called on repeatedly to stand down. On the Israel/Palestine question he says it's a deal he'd like to do. But he will not be viewed as an impartial negotiator. Most Palestinians see the US as biased towards Israel anyway but in Mr Trump they see a man who is openly partisan. His pledge to move the US embassy to disputed Jerusalem is already proving to be incendiary. It's hard to think he will go through with it but you never know with a man who has unpredictability written through his DNA. The consequences of such a move could be huge and at the very least will exacerbate the tensions in this long-running conflict. The Military By Alistair Bunkall, Defence Correspondent Donald Trump dismissed NATO as "obsolete" during the US presidential campaign. He warned that America wouldn't automatically come to the help of countries not spending at least 2% of GDP on their defence, as NATO guidelines stipulate. It certainly made Europe sit up and take notice. His criticism of some members, for not spending enough on defence, has its supporters in the UK government and elsewhere. If the effect of this threat is that more alliance members boost defence spending that will only be a good thing. It's Mr Trump's relationship with Russia that might characterise his use of the military. It's Mr Trump's relationship with Russia that might characterise his use of the military. Alistair Bunkall Will he sustain the growing presence of US forces in Eastern Europe? Will he support Montenegro's accession to NATO membership against Russia's wishes? Will he turn a blind eye to Russian activity in eastern Ukraine? How will he react to further Russian bombing of civilians in Syria? When Barack Obama came to office, al Qaeda, Afghanistan and Iraq were the three major interests for US forces. As he leaves the White House, the landscape has changed beyond any prediction, with the emergence of IS and re-emergence of an aggressive Russia. Those are the two challenges Mr Trump inherits, but the only prediction I would confidently make, is that a threat will emerge that no one has yet identified. Politics By Faisal Islam, Political Editor A Trump White House can change the game for Brexit. At first glance, Britain jumps straight to the front of the queue for a trade deal, ahead of the great trading Pacific and European trading block deals. It provides a tangible sign of progress outside the EU for the Brexiteers. It also gives UK negotiators some leverage with the EU. Do Paris and Brussels really want a fast growing low-tax, low-regulation island off its coast, integrated with the world's largest economic superpower? And also gives the US some trade leverage with the EU too. A Trump White House can change the game for Brexit. Faisal Islam However, it also risks setting up a dangerous dynamic for a UK-EU negotiation. If European capitals see the EU as under attack from the Trump White House, aided and abetted by the UK, the exit negotiations will be conducted in survival mode rather than in a spirit of mutual economic benefit. It increases the risk of an antagonistic, legalistic and painful divorce, rather than a friendly separation with the UK's largest trade partner. If the EU thinks the Trump White House predicts, desires and accepts the end of the European Union, as he has repeatedly implied, they will negotiate accordingly with Britain. Europe By Mark Stone, Europe Correspondent Just days after the US election, a high-profile EU delegation hastily left Brussels for Washington. The fact-finding trip was a chance to establish contacts with the incoming administration. Mr Trump's victory was a surprise for every European government. All but one (Hungary) bet on Hillary Clinton and their contacts with Team Trump were thin and his electioneering rhetoric concerning. His broadside assault on Europe and NATO this week seems to reduce any hope among EU leaders that he didn't mean what he said during the election. Perhaps he did: "NATO is obsolete, the EU is doomed, Merkel made a catastrophic mistake." These are huge statements which threaten to shatter the historic transatlantic relationship. His broadside assault on Europe and NATO this week seems to reduce any hope among EU leaders that he didn't mean what he said during the election. Mark Stone "Let's not fool ourselves," German Chancellor Angela Merkel said last week in Brussels. "From the viewpoint of some of our traditional partners, and I’m thinking of transatlantic ties, there is no guarantee of perpetuity for close cooperation with us Europeans." For some weeks, the diplomatic whispers have suggested that Team Trump seems almost to relish the demise of the EU. The outgoing US ambassador to the EU has said Mr Trump's advisers asked the EU leadership who would leave next after the UK. "It's not a surprise, right," ambassador Anthony Gardner said. "That's what is the mentality of this [Trump] team: 'this thing is falling apart. Who's next?'" The Trump effect has emboldened European nationalists and populists who count themselves among Mr Trump's friends: Britain's Nigel Farage; France's far-right leader Marine Le Pen, spotted in Trump Tower last week and a genuine prospect for the French presidency; Geert Wilders, leader of the Netherlands’ populist Freedom Party and candidate for Dutch prime minister. The Trump-effect has emboldened European nationalists and populists who count themselves among Mr Trump's friends. Mark Stone Will Mr Trump offer the UK a generous trade deal to spite the EU in the Brexit negotiations? Great news for the UK, less good for the rest of the EU. Will some in Europe see a silver lining? Perhaps a Trump presidency will strengthen European Union cohesion. European federalists will be emboldened to push forward their political project; an EU Army? A bolder, more unified EU foreign policy? The establishment governments will double down on their fight against populism. Asia By Katie Stallard, China Correspondent Perhaps there was an assumption here that Mr Trump's penchant for China-bashing would be left on the campaign trail, that it was just the price of riding his wave of populism into office. I remember one Chinese academic explaining patiently that US presidential candidates behaved in one way when they were running for election, quite another once they got into power. But what if President Trump turns out to be as advertised? What if he actually means what he says? The consequences for this region could be explosive. His comments on Taiwan, specifically on the nearly four decades-old 'one China' policy that recognises the island as a part of China, risk serious escalation. Katie Stallard The indications from his Twitter feed, and his team so far are not encouraging. His comments on Taiwan, specifically on the nearly four decades-old 'one China' policy that recognises the island as a part of China, risk serious escalation. Perhaps this was just the opening gambit from a man who prides himself on being a tough dealmaker, but for Beijing, which sailed its aircraft carrier through the Taiwan Strait last week to underline its point, this is not up for negotiation. Video: US/China relations biggest business risk Then there is the South China Sea, where Rex Tillerson, Mr Trump's nominee for Secretary of State, says China's artificial island-building must stop, and its access to them be blocked. That would mean waging "a large-scale war", a Chinese state-controlled newspaper replied. And that's before we get to North Korea, where Kim Jong-Un claims to be in the final phases of testing an intercontinental ballistic missile. "It won't happen," Donald Trump immediately tweeted. He will need more than a 140-character response. By Tom Rayner, South East Asia Correspondent It's no secret America's allies in the Asia-Pacific region are preparing for a Trump presidency with trepidation. And they've good reason. Early indications are that the Trump administration seems perfectly prepared to upend US foreign policy orthodoxy. In Asia, that orthodoxy, whether articulated by Barack Obama's Asia Pivot, or by earlier policies of the Bush administration, means the US offering a diplomatic, economic and military alternative to Chinese influence. Anything else, it is reasoned, would result in a radical reordering of the regional balance of power that could only strengthen China. When President-elect Trump questioned US military aid to rock-solid allies like Japan during the campaign, the long-standing orthodoxy was immediately drawn into question. Tom Rayner When the-then President-elect Trump questioned US military aid to rock-solid allies like Japan during the campaign, the long-standing orthodoxy was immediately drawn into question. That prime minister Shinzo Abe was the first foreign leader to meet him after his election victory should be seen as clear indication of the nervousness. But there is also the possibility the uneasiness felt from Hanoi to Tokyo, by those who fear the consequences of US withdrawal from the region, might be misplaced. If Mr Trump's hawkish inclination to stare down China and call its bluff outweighs his apparently instinctual isolationism, new efforts to bolster ties with regional allies could - if only through pragmatism - be the result. Africa By Alex Crawford, Special Correspondent Donald Trump has expressed no interest whatsoever in Africa. In most of his campaign speeches, the continent was mostly disregarded. But based on what he has said, aid for African countries is likely to suffer. There are likely to be restrictions on the numbers travelling to the US for further education or business. His anti-Muslim sentiments have dismayed the continent's multi-million Muslim population. Donald Trump has expressed no interest whatsoever in Africa. Based on what he has said, aid for African countries is likely to suffer. Alex Crawford His economic plans are a mystery but given his business ambitions, Africans are hoping he may want to take on Chinese expansion on the continent. He has stated his desire to curb terrorism by 'bombing the s**t out of ISIS', and the spread of terrorism across a number of African nations may catch his attention with the terror group prevalent in Libya as well as the ISIS-aligned Boko Haram in Nigeria and al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab in Somalia. With few hopes, the only way is up for a Trump presidency. Technology By Tom Cheshire, Technology Correspondent Don't worry: Donald Trump is "here to help". That's what he told technology executives at a meeting at Trump Tower - a group that included Apple chief executive Tim Cook, Elon Musk of Tesla and Google founder Larry Page. Having spent much of the campaign attacking Mr Trump, Silicon Valley has been quick to come to heel - business being business. But trouble may be in store. At a rally before the election, Mr Trump savaged Apple over its dispute with the FBI about the San Bernardino killer's iPhone, calling for a boycott of the company's products and saying about Tim Cook: "I would come down so hard on him - you have no idea - his head would be spinning all of the way back to Silicon Valley." (Mr Obama had been more equivocal on the subject.) Apparently he doesn't use a computer himself. (If only the same were true of his mobile phone and the Twitter app installed there). Tom Cheshire The wider picture, though, is that Mr Trump has barely a clue about technology. Apparently he doesn't use a computer himself. (If only the same were true of his mobile phone and the Twitter app installed there.) In Mr Trump's own words: "The whole age of computer has made it where nobody knows exactly what's going on." Right. Celebrities By Katie Spencer, Entertainment Correspondent Given Hollywood's left-leaning tilt, presidential parties look set to be a far less interesting affair under Donald Trump's watch. Virtually no celebrities were willing to stand alongside him on the campaign trail, and little seems to have changed following his election victory. Apart from a visit by rapper Kanye West, few stars have wanted to be seen with him. Mr Trump's team reportedly struggled to secure singers to perform at his inauguration and he made some high-profile enemies before he even entered office - see Meryl Streep's Golden Globes speech for reference. Apart from a visit by rapper Kanye West, few stars have wanted to be seen with him. Katie Spencer Mr Trump has shown he can be a master of the one-liner comebacks but he's struggled at being the butt of jokes. Alec Baldwin's Saturday Night Live impression - the orange hairpiece and pronunciation of the word "China" - has been laughed at the world over. And making fun of Mr Trump only seems to draw him out. He tweeted: "Just tried watching Saturday Night Live - unwatchable! Totally biased, not funny and the Baldwin impersonation just can't get any worse. Sad." This is a man who understands the power of television. He became known for his blunt toughness on reality TV. His brand had been known for a time before, but the US version of The Apprentice allowed him to mould his image even further. The Donald's dynasty is every bit as fascinating as the Kardashians. Katie Spencer By the end of the first season, 27 million were tuning in to see him point his finger and deliver the classic "you're fired" line from inside Trump Tower. Not only was he promoting his business empire, his straight talking, no-nonsense approach helped him to build an army of fans who listen when he speaks. That reality show is now over, but a new one begins. His lack of celebrity friends won't really matter - he has his family standing alongside him. With his former model wife Melania, glamorous daughter Ivanka and the rest of Trump clan, The Donald's dynasty is every bit as fascinating as the Kardashians.

Here is a selection of useful apps that can make the most of your flight time. Hover Picture 2 of 12 Flying a drone requires two things: good weather and a spot from which to take off. Hover helps you find both by providing a simple fly/no fly indication, based on live weather updates and a database of no-fly zones. At a glance, it indicates whether your location is a good one and if the weather is suitable for takeoff. The app also provides details of how the weather is going to change over the next few hours, which is useful for figuring out if you should fly now or later. It's a simple app that every drone pilot should have, and it also includes a simple flight log that helps you track your flying hours. Autopilot Picture 3 of 12 DJI's own Go app is pretty capable, but Autopilot adds a range of new features that make a DJI Phantom, Inspire 1 or Mavic Pro into a much more capable camera platform. It provides new ways to move the camera and track objects, creating much smoother, more natural-looking cinematic shots. Autopilot also captures a lot more data while the drone is flying, which is useful if you are having a technical problem and want to know where the problem lies. Parrot Flight Plan Picture 4 of 12 All Parrot drones come with a free app called FreeFlight Pro, which handles the basics of flight, providing on-screen controls and a preview of the camera image. The $20 optional Flight Plan takes this further, adding the ability for you to plan a flight, then send that information to the drone for it to fly autonomously. You create a flight plan by selecting waypoints and how high you want the drone to be at each one. The app then calculates the path to take to fly between them, and, with the tap of a button, sends the drone along this flight path. More advanced features are also available, such as controlling the direction that the camera is pointing and controlling when video is recorded. These preplanned flights can also be saved and reloaded at any time, which is useful if you want to take seasonal or construction videos. AirMap Picture 5 of 12 AirMap initially looks like just another map app for drones, indicating where you can and can't fly. It does that (in fact, most other apps source their no-fly-zone maps from AirMap), but it offers one interesting new feature: a Digital Notice and Awareness System. This is a new AirMap system that lets you push a button to notify nearby airports that you are flying a drone. It's legal to fly a drone within 5 miles of an airport, but you have to notify the airport or local air traffic control in case they detect it on their radar. AirMap does this online, using a system that the company is building in cooperation with airports, 125 of which support the system so far. This same system also keeps an eye on local air traffic, warning you if any manned aircraft are flying nearby. Pix4D Picture 6 of 12 Photogrammetry is the process of creating a 3D model from a 2D image, such as a drone video. That's what Pix4D does: This app automatically creates a flight path for your drone (models from DJI, 3DR and Parrot are supported), then uploads the video and flight data to the Pix4D servers. You can then use these servers or your desktop PC to crunch through this data, turning the images and location of the drone into a 3D model of whatever you were flying over. The full service isn't cheap ($499 for a year's subscription of unlimited model making), but Pix4D does offer a 15-day trial that will allow you to try out the service. DJI Store Picture 7 of 12 The DJI Store app mainly exists to sell you stuff, but it also has another useful feature: a map of flying hotspots. This helps you find who is flying in your neighborhood by letting you know of any user-submitted flying spots in your neighborhood, and the profiles of the people who fly there. You can also post a profile yourself and share any inspiring photos of popular spots with other fliers. GoPro Passenger Picture 8 of 12 GoPro's Karma drone may have hit a few snags (the company recalled it after the first units it sold kept falling out of the sky), but when it finally becomes widely available, you'll be able to grab a neat app called Passenger, which allows a second user to view the wireless video from the camera that's attached to the drone. The second user will also be able to control the camera, panning and tilting it around as the pilot controls the drone itself. In effect, that person will be able to work as the camera operator while the pilot keeps the drone flying. Quadcopter FX Simulator Picture 9 of 12 There are lots of apps available that claim to be drone simulators, but few of them are any good at simulating the real experience. Quadcopter FX Simulator is one of the better ones, because it does a very nice job of reproducing the feel and experience of flying a drone. You get access to a number of viewpoints — including the ground — plus a normal camera on the drone and a stabilized gimbal. The controls can be customized and tweaked a lot, and models of a number of different sizes and types of drone are included. If you pay $4.99 for the pro version, you get more flying locations and even more customization. Unlike the real thing, however, in this app, you just press a button to return to your takeoff point and repair your drone. Sun Surveyor Picture 10 of 12 Planning to take a video of a dramatic sunset? Sun Surveyor can help you make sure you get the shot. Working from a map, the app will show you the path of the sun and moon, including precise times for sunrise, sunset and the lunar equivalents over the entire year. If you are at the location, Sun Surveyor will even show you the path that the sun and moon will take in the sky by overlaying it on the camera view, enabling you to scout a location for the perfect shot. It can even use Google Street view data to show you a preview of how the sun might rise over buildings. DJI Ground Station Pro Picture 11 of 12 DJI has just released this app for serious and professional drone users who want to create complex autonomous flight paths. It's designed to make the process of creating these paths easier by automating it. The user selects an area on the map that he or she wants to survey, and the app automatically creates a flight path that covers the entire area, giving you the ability to adjust the amount of detail that is needed. If you just want a quick, rough overview, Ground Station Pro will do a few passes. If you want much more detailed images (for building a 3D model or for surveying the land), it will create a path with more passes that provides the multiple views that the enhanced detail needs.

A new job posting suggests the company incorporate the technology into its e-commerce. By Kevin J. Ryan Kevin J. Ryan is a staff writer for Inc. He has written for ESPN The Magazine and the Long Island Press and contributed to Mental Floss. He lives in Queens, New York. @wheresKR Staff writer, Inc.@wheresKR WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Just about everyone, at some point, has bought an item online only to receive it and be disappointed. That remains perhaps the biggest advantage of shopping in-store--the ability to see what a product looks like in person. Amazon might be looking to remove some of the uncertainty using virtual reality. A new job listing at A9, Amazon's product search branch, is for a creative director of VR. The listing was first spotted by Variety. "You will envision the future of Amazon's VR solutions and guide our creative and technical teams to produce compelling, world-class experiences," the listing says. The role requires knowing "how to use the VR medium to tell a story about any product at Amazon to the customer." Exactly what that might look like in practice is open to interpretation, but it seems to suggest that Jeff Bezos's company wants to help customers see or experience products in VR before they click "Buy." Not that Amazon is necessarily having trouble in the sales department: the company pulled in $107 billion in sales in 2015. Amazon hasn't reported its year-end earnings yet, but has already said that the 2016 holiday season was its best ever. This wouldn't be the first time Amazon has ventured into VR. In November, Amazon Studios, the production arm behind the company's Prime Video service, hired former Tribeca Film Festival head Genna Terranova to lead the development of its VR content. Other tech giants have invested in the technology in recent years. In 2014 Facebook paid $2 billion for Oculus, which last year released the $600 Rift headset aimed primarily at hardcore gamers. Google has released affordable VR options like Cardboard, and in November released Daydream View, a $79 headset that's compatible with the new Pixel phone. Apple has filed for patents and made VR-related hires in recent years, though it hasn't made its intentions in the space publicly known. While Amazon's main headquarters are in Seattle, the new opening is in Palo Alto, where A9 is based. Published on: Jan 20, 2017 Advertisement
