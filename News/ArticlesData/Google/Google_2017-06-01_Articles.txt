(3 letters) Apple Inc. is already in your pocket, on your desk and underneath your television. Soon, a device embossed with “Designed by Apple in California” may be on your nightstand or kitchen counter as well. The iPhone-maker has started manufacturing a long-in-the-works Siri-controlled smart speaker, according to people familiar with the matter. Apple could debut the speaker as soon as its annual developer conference this month, but the device will not be ready to ship until later in the year, the people said. The device will differ from Amazon.com Inc.’s Echo and Alphabet Inc.’s Google Home speakers by offering virtual surround sound technology and deep integration with Apple’s product lineup, said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss products that aren’t yet public. Introducing a speaker would serve two main purposes: providing a hub to automate appliances and lights via Apple’s HomeKit system, and establishing a bulwark inside the home to lock customers more tightly into Apple’s network of services. That would help combat the competitive threat from Google’s and Amazon’s connected speakers: the Home and Echo mostly don’t support services from Apple. Without compatible hardware, users may be more likely to opt for the Echo or Home, and therefore use streaming music offerings such as Spotify, Amazon Prime Music or Google Play rather than Apple Music. “This will be a platform for developing Apple’s services,” says Gene Munster, a co-founder of Loup Ventures and former Apple analyst. Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller declined to comment. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has emphasized Apple’s services businesses over the past 18 months as iPhone sales slowed. He expects service revenue to double by 2020 from last year’s $24 billion. A speaker may help keep customers loyal to service products such as Apple Music, a subscription music streaming offering that costs $10 per month. The speaker would likely be tucked into Apple’s “Other Products” category, which currently includes devices like the Apple Watch, Apple TV and AirPods. That set of products generated $11 billion in sales last year. Inventec Corp., the Taipei manufacturer that already makes the AirPod wireless headphones, will add the speaker to its Apple repertoire, the people said. Apple employees have been secretly testing the device in their homes for several months, they said. The Siri speaker reached an advanced prototype stage late last year, Bloomberg News reported at the time. An Inventec representative didn’t respond to a request for comment outside normal business hours in Taiwan. This year’s developers conference will be the first since 2013 to introduce new hardware. Apple could announce updated iPad tablets at the conference, one of the people said. Apple last updated the 9.7-inch iPad Pro in March 2016 and hasn’t refreshed the larger 12.9-inch model since its November 2015 debut. Planned Mac updates will include refreshed versions of the MacBook and MacBook Pro with faster Intel Corp. processors, Bloomberg News reported last month. Apple hopes that more advanced acoustics technology will give the speaker an edge over competitors, according to people with knowledge of the product’s development. Along with generating virtual surround sound, the speakers being tested are louder and reproduce sound more crisply than rival offerings, the people said. Apple also has considered including sensors that measure a room’s acoustics and automatically adjust audio levels during use, one of the people said. Apple also will likely let third-party services build products for the speaker. Last year, Apple opened up Siri on the iPhone to the likes of Uber Technologies Inc. and Facebook Inc., allowing a user to order a ride or send a WhatsApp message with a voice command. The device will be a hub for Apple’s HomeKit home automation system, letting users control devices such as lights, door locks and window blinds. At present, an Apple TV or iPad is required to control that equipment from outside the home or automatically. The Echo and Google Home both support third-party services and smart home appliances. Ahead of Apple’s launch, the competition has upgraded their speakers with support for making voice calls, while Amazon’s gained a touchscreen. Apple’s speaker won’t include such a screen, according to people who have seen the product. An Apple-designed speaker with high-end sound quality that fits perfectly into the Apple ecosystem is a familiar pitch. In 2006, Apple unveiled the iPod Hi-Fi, a battery powered speaker designed to cast a shadow over the thriving iPod third-party accessory market. With its bulky size and high price point, the Hi-Fi flopped and was discontinued within 18 months of launching. With Siri and a clear hole in its ecosystem, Apple is banking that its second try at a speaker product will do better.

(MUST CREDIT: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg) Published June 04. 2017 12:01AM  By Hamza Shaban The Washington Post Google co-founder Sergey Brin is spending more than $100 million to build the world's largest airship, a blimp with a rigid structure designed to both deliver supplies abroad for humanitarian projects and ferry Brin's family and friends around the globe, the Guardian newspaper reported. The project is the latest example of Silicon Valley attempting to reshape how goods and people are moved. But some say it also underscores a penchant for tech moguls to color their projects with seemingly virtuous ambition. Some people on social media seized on the vessel's apparent dual purpose. On the one hand, it's a benevolent carrier transporting food to remote, hard-pressed communities, and on the other it's a luxurious "air yacht," as the Guardian report described it, shuttling a billionaire and his inner circle to exotic locations. Google declined to comment. The vessel is reportedly being built at the NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California. When completed, the airship will become the world's largest aircraft at about 650 feet long, although its payload is not known, according to the Guardian. Plans for the vessel, which is being funded by Brin, were first reported by Bloomberg earlier this year. Experts say that the use of airships could bypass the congestion and costs tied to transporting cargo via roads, railways and airports. But lighter-than-air travel presents its own challenges, like the need to steady the aircraft by offsetting the weight of cargo once it's offloaded. According to the Guardian, Brin's vessel will use a series of internal bladders to stabilize its flight. Brin began his plans to build the vessel about three years ago, according to Bloomberg. His fascination with airships was sparked by visits to the Ames Research Center, next to the headquarters of Google's parent company, Alphabet. Ames once housed the navy airship USS Macon, which spanned about 784 feet and was among the largest aircraft of its time in the 1930s. Silicon Valley's novel charitable efforts have been criticized in the past, perhaps most prominently in the case of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's internet.org initiative, which aims to bring Internet access to the billions of people who don't have it. With altruistic motives but lucrative business prospects, some see Zuckerberg's initiative less as a magnanimous Internet project than as a version of high-tech imperialism. It's unclear whether Brin's airship will be put to commercial use. But Larry Page, CEO of Alphabet and the other co-founder of Google, has also taken a keen interest in innovative aircraft. Page has personally backed two flying-car start-ups, Kitty Hawk and Zee.Aero. Kitty Hawk's flyer, a personal electric aircraft that hovers over water, will be available for purchase later this year.   Previous Article Next Article Loading comment count...

It seems HTC agreed, because its new flagship, the HTC U11, is here and it's better in almost every way. Priced at $649, the HTC U11 features a big, bright, 5.5-inch screen; markedly faster performance; and a camera that rivals the best from Samsung and Apple, all while sporting a gorgeous, gem-like design. But the highlights don't stop there, because the U11 packs a total of four microphones, two voice assistants (with a third on the way) and built-in pressure sensors that let you open apps by squeezing the sides of the phone. After HTC produced a string of middling devices, the U11 is exactly what the company needed to remind people that it's still alive.  Availability In stores, the U11 is exclusive to Sprint. However, if you buy online, you can get this phone unlocked. There are carrier-specific versions of the U11 for all the big providers on Amazon or directly from HTC.com. Design: A symphony in glass There's no shortage of glass-backed phones nowadays, but I defy you to you find one (aside from the U Ultra) that looks like the U11. For the U11's back, HTC started with a single flat sheet of Gorilla Glass 3 and squashed it into progressively curvier molds to form a smooth, rounded back that looks more like sci-fi jewel scarab than a piece of consumer tech.  Below the display, you get a combo fingerprint sensor that also doubles as a capacitive-touch home button, along with two more touch buttons on either side, for Back and Recent Apps. The lock button on the right side sports a jagged texture, so you can recognize it by feel, while the smooth volume rocker sits above that. The U11's top edge features a removable SIM tray with space for a microSD card when you want to add some additional capacity to the U11's built-in 64GB of storage. Some folks may take issue with the U11's sizable bezels on top and bottom now that we live in an age of super-skinny smartphone designs. But for me, the bigger issue is that the bezels on top and bottom are different widths. Had they been the same, the phone would look a little more balanced and a bit less bulky, though with its 5.5-inch display and 16:9 aspect ratio, the U11 was never going to be a truly compact device.  Measuring 6.06 x 2.99 x 0.31-inches and weighing 5.96 ounces, the HTC U11 is practically the same size as the Google Pixel XL (6.09 x 2.98 x 0.33 inches and 5.93 ounces). However, compare the U11 to the Galaxy S8 (5.86 x 2.68 x 0.31 inches and 5.47 ounces), and Samsung's flagship feels significantly smaller and sleeker. That's despite the S8 having a total screen area that's actually slightly larger, thanks to its 18.5:9 aspect-ratio display. A simple squeeze of the U11's sides can open an app or even take a picture. Like any good flagship smartphone in 2017, the U11 boasts IP67 water resistance, so you won't have to worry about any spills or dips in the sink trashing your device.  Edge Sense: Do we really need a squeezable phone? Moto has its Moto Actions gesture commands, and Huawei has its Knuckle Sense shortcuts. But with Edge Sense, HTC might have the weirdest motion controls of them all. You don't make movements with your hands or draw letters on the screen; instead, the U11 features pressure sensors built into the sides of the phone, so a simple squeeze can open an app or even take a picture. By default, Edge Sense is set to open the camera when you squeeze the phone, but you can reprogram the feature to open pretty much any app on the device or toggle functions like the flashlight or Wi-Fi. Depending on what you choose, Edge Sense even has a bit of contextual smarts, letting you perform different tasks with the same simple action. For instance, you can open the camera on the first squeeze and then snap a pic on the second. Edge Sense's advanced settings will also let you add a second function for when you squeeze and hold the phone. The 5.5-inch QHD display delivers on the three most important qualities of a good screen: brightness, color and accuracy. The best use of Edge Sense is probably for taking a selfie, since your hands will likely be in the correct position to give the phone a little hand hug. However, I've found that even when Edge Sense's was set to its most sensitive pressure setting, trying to squeeze the phone while posing for a shot caused the device to shake more than if I had just tapped on the screen. In fact, the action of squeezing the U11 makes holding the phone that much trickier. While it didn't happen to me, because I went out of my way to be super careful, I wouldn't be surprised to hear about people dropping the U11 while trying to squeeze it.  MORE: Best Smartphones on the Market Now Display: Big and bright The 5.5-inch QHD display on the HTC U11 keeps things simple and delivers on the three most important qualities of a good screen: brightness, color and accuracy. You don't get pure blacks like you would on a phone with an OLED display (such as the Pixel or Galaxy S8), but the U11 still offers pretty solid contrast. Initially, the U11 had a somewhat cool color casting that accentuated blues and downplayed warmer tones, but a quick trip to the phone's color-temperature setting makes it easy to adjust the screen however you want. In practically no time, I had the crimson and neon green blaster bolts shooting out from the X-wings and TIE fighters in The Last Jedi trailer looking exactly how I wanted. That's a nice bit of customizability that not every phone offers.  With the adaptive brightness on, we got the HTC U11 to hit a peak output of 512 nits. That puts it a fair bit ahead the Galaxy S8 and Google Pixel XL, which hit 437 nits and 396 nits, respectively. With its stereo BoomSound speakers and noise-cancelling headphones, the HTC U11 offers the best overall listening experience of any phone on the market. The U11 also earned some of the highest marks for color accuracy we've seen in recent history, as it notched a Delta-E rating of 0.34 (numbers closer to zero are better). The S8 was equally as good, with a rating of 0.36, while the Pixel was pretty far off, at 5.88.  As for color range, the U11's LCD display didn't fare quite as well as some of its AMOLED-equipped competition. Still, with a gamut that covered 166 percent of the sRGB spectrum, the U11 wasn't that far off the respective 183 percent and 191 percent tallies of the Galaxy S8 and Google Pixel XL. Audio: Punchy stereo speakers, but no headphone jack With its stereo BoomSound speakers and included noise-cancelling headphones, the HTC U11 offers the best overall listening experience of any phone on the market. But there's one big downer: Like other recent HTC phones, the U11 lacks a headphone jack.  The U11's BoomSound setup uses the bottom-firing speaker in tandem with the earpiece to put out a truly impressive amount of sound. The feature makes phones with single-speaker setups, like the Galaxy S8, sound embarrassingly bad, and when you put the U11 up against phones, like the iPhone 7, with similar two-speaker arrangements, the U11 stills wins on both volume and sound quality. MORE: Best Cheap Unlocked Smartphones When you want to listen to things a bit more privately, HTC includes a pair of special USB-C earbuds that automatically create a personalized audio profile specifically tuned for your ears. On top of that, HTC uses the tiny mics built into the earbuds to provide true noise cancellation, which should be a big boon to anyone listening to music on a plane or train. I also appreciate how HTC includes three different size tips for its earbuds to help ensure a better fit.  The U11's 12-megapixel rear camera produced stunning shots, putting HTC on an equal footing with camera phones from Apple, Google and Samsung. But there's a downside: Even though HTC has thoughtfully included a dongle so you can still use your old-school headphones, the adaptive audio and noise-cancelling tech needs both the USB-C audio processing and HTC's custom earbuds to function. In other words, those special features won't work on third-party headphones. Cameras: New heights for HTC It seems like HTC has been promising big things from its Ultrapixel cameras forever, and on the U11, the company has really delivered. The U11's 12-megapixel rear camera produced stunning shots, putting HTC on an equal footing with phone cameras from Apple, Google and Samsung. I especially liked some of the low-light shots I got, which looked noticeably brighter and less grainy compared to images from the S8.  During the daytime, the U11 also wowed, offering a more restrained counterpoint to the super-rich and saturated shots captured by the Galaxy S8. On the front, though, the U11's 16-MP selfie cam was less compelling than I hoped. The Flower Shot A picture of a flower can tell you a lot of things about a camera, and while neither the Galaxy S8 nor the U11 nailed it 100 percent, HTC's phone still impressed. This comparison exposes the S8's tendency to oversaturate colors, which resulted in unnaturally vivid magenta petals instead of the softer pink tones you see from the U11. The S8's picture is just a tad sharper, though a few areas could be called oversharp. The Food Shot In the contest to see which phone shoots a better burger, the U11 came out on top. It's close, but the U11's pic looks warmer; features more-accurate colors; offers better details in the bun, bacon and onion rings; and simply made the sandwich look more delicious. In fact, when I asked my co-workers to pick which phone's photo they prefered, every single person chose the U11's pic. The Outdoors Shot In the last of the daylight comparisons, the S8 hit back hard with a shot that beat the U11's pic in almost every aspect: color, sharpness, detail, you name it. The S8's pic even did a better job of preserving the baby blue sky in the background. The Low-Light Close-Up Shot At night, when I took a minute to snap my growing family of plushies, the U11 showed some serious low-light skills, producing a better-exposed, less grainy picture than the Galaxy S8 did. Meanwhile, the S8's shot looked overly yellow, and without the S8's pic as a comparison, you might not even know this was a low-light shot at all. MORE: Galaxy S8 vs. iPhone 7 Camera Shootout: Samsung Has the Edge The Outdoors Low-Light Shot In even less light, the U11 once again wowed, with a nighttime shot that's noticeably brighter and less noisy than the S8's photo. In the S8's image, you lose a lot of detail in the darker sections in the foreground, and the overly yellow white balance give the plants a sickly, unpleasant appearance.   In general, I found that the U11 outperforms the S8 is many low-light scenarios, though results can vary. When I walked just a bit farther and took a shot of a nearby pool, the S8's shot was clearly superior, as the U11's photo showed worse exposure and white balance. Selfies With a 16-MP front cam that captures double the resolution of the Galaxy S8, you might expect the U11 to come out firmly ahead. However, that wasn't the case. Quite often, the S8's front camera produced sharper, more-detailed photos than the U11 did. Yes, the background in the U11's pic is better-exposed, but if you look at things like my hair or shirt, it's clear how much better the S8's pic is. Performance: As fast as it gets When you combine Qualcomm's powerful Snapdragon 835 processor with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, you get some of the best performance on a smartphone available right now. On Geekbench 4, which measures overall system performance, the U11 posted a score of 6,493; that's slightly higher than what we got from the Samsung Galaxy S8 (6,124). Meanwhile, Google's Pixel XL and its Snapdragon 821 processor performed 35 percent worse, with a score of 4,146.  It was the same story for web performance, where the U11 scored 70.52 on the JetStream 1.1 JavaScript test. The Galaxy S8 was only slightly behind, with a score of 67.5, while the Google Pixel XL was pretty far back, with a score of 55.93. MORE: Galaxy S8 vs. iPhone 7: Which Phone Is Really the Fastest? The U11's graphics performance was also quite impressive. On 3DMark's IceStorm Unlimited test, the U11 hit 40,946, versus 35,903 for the Galaxy S8, and just 28,182 for the Pixel XL.  Software: Two digital assistants with one more on the way HTC has maintained a pretty light touch on Android 7.1, so that its Sense UI will look instantly familiar to anyone with even the slightest knowledge of Google's mobile OS. Some small differences include the BlinkFeed news app that appears when you swipe right from the home screen; that's normally where Google Now cards live. The HTC U11 also features a more traditional icon for the app drawer instead of the minimalist app launcher you'd get on a Pixel. The one big addition HTC tacks on is its Sense Companion, which is another digital assistant that works alongside the built-in Google Assistant. The two assistants have a lot of overlapping features, including the ability to set reminders or notify you when you're near a place of interest, but Google's assistant still has the clear lead in search and answering questions.  The Sense Companion is actually more like a digital secretary, as it may remind you to recharge your phone in the afternoon so you won't run low while attending meetings at night. Or it may tell you that you need to step up your activity, after noticing a lower-than-normal step count earlier in the day. In practice, I found that just letting the Sense Companion do its thing was a helpful but not essential tool for better personal and device management. But when I had a question I needed answering, Google is still the one I asked for by name.  Coming sometime this summer (think early July), Alexa will also make an appearance on the U11. Unlike with half-baked attempts to incorporate Amazon's voice assistant into other phones, which require you to physically open an app before voicing your request, using Alexa on the U11 should be exactly the same as talking to an Amazon Echo or Dot. However, since Alexa wasn't available on our review unit, we're not sure how the assistant will perform. Battery Life: Pretty good but not great The U11 has more than enough battery life to last a full workday. However, as battery life on smartphones continues to improve across the board, the U11's longevity doesn't really stand out.  On the Tom's Guide Battery Test (continuous web surfing using Sprint 4G LTE), the U11 lasted 9 hours and 38 minutes. That's just marginally better than the 9:32 smartphone average and an hour to an hour-and-a-half less than the times for competing flagships, such as the Galaxy S8 (10:39) and the Google Pixel XL (11:11). MORE: Smartphones with the Longest Battery Life When it comes time to recharge the phone, the U11 features Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0, which can recharge the phone to over 50 percent in 30 minutes. Strangely though, the U11 doesn't have support for Quick Charge 4.0, even though all Snapdragon 835 devices should have support for Qualcomm's newer charging standard. Unfortunately, for those who don't want to deal with wires, the U11, does not support wireless charging.  Bottom Line HTC can keep its Sense Companion and its squeezable Edge Sense controls. Those features work as advertised, but I don't need 'em. The things that really makes the U11 stand out are its unique jewel-like design, thumping BoomSound speakers, superb performance and a rear camera that can keep pace with the best from Apple, Google and Samsung. However, even though the Galaxy S8 costs $100 more, I still have to give a slight edge to that phone, due to its more one-hand-friendly design, better display and longer battery life. The S8's headphone jack is nice, too. Still, it's a close call, made even closer by features like the U11's noise-cancelling earbuds and forthcoming Alexa integration, which could both convince you to side with the U11. And if they did, you'd be making a solid choice, because the U11 is the best phone HTC has made in the last five years. Photo credit: Shaun Lucas/Tom's Guide. Comparisons: Sam Rutherford/Tom's Guide. 8/10 Quick Take The U11 is the best phone HTC's offered in years, and the device's camera matches up nicely with that of the more expensive Galaxy S8. Still, Samsung's phone lasts longer on a charge and offers both a better design and display. $649.00 Amazon About the author Sam Rutherford @samrutherford Sam Rutherford is a senior product reviews analyst at Tom's Guide who covers smartphones, car tech and cameras.

[Update: Site is live, more details] Google launches Funding Choices, a way for users to pay sites to hide ads Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/06/01 8:01pm PDTJun 1, 2017 54 Plus 1 on G+ 126 Share on Facebook 77 Share on Twitter Total Shares257 Games News Update 1: 2017/06/01 8:01pm PDT The new site for Google Contributor/Funding Choices is live, and offers some new insight into how the service actually works. According to the signup page, each page without ads You may recall Google Contributor, which was a service by Google that allowed users to pay a monthly contribution to see fewer ads online. Your money would directly substitute the money earned by the site for advertisements. Contributor was discontinued in late 2016, with Google saying that an improved version would become available in "early 2017." Today, the company launched Funding Choices, the successor to Contributor. Currently in beta, it allows sites to show a customized message to visitors using an ad blocker. The message asks users to either enable ads for the site, or pay for a pass through Contributor that removes all ads on that site. Unlike the original Contributor, Funding Choices hides more than just AdSense ads If you're reading this and thinking, "I really wish Android Police would do this," then you're in luck. We've been part of Google's internal beta, but we're not quite ready to roll it out. Just know that we are definitely working on it. The new Contributor site doesn't seem to be live yet, but there will likely be more details there soon. Source: Google Update 1: 2017/06/01 8:01pm PDT The new site for Google Contributor/Funding Choices is live, and offers some new insight into how the service actually works. According to the signup page, each page without ads that you view on a site costs a small amount, with publishers apparently able to change the price (most of them seem to use $0.01 per page right now). So assuming $0.01 per page, $1 gets you 100 pages without ads, and Google is offering a $5 pass to start out with. Not bad pricing at all, as long as sites stay around the $0.01 price point. Google also offers a list of sites supporting Google Contributor, which currently includes Beliefnet, Business Insider UK, ComicBook, Eurogamer, Grub Street, Hot Air, Parkers, Patheos, Popular Mechanics, Townhall, Twitchy, and World Wide Gaming.

NexusPhan The ads in AP are not bad. Very reasonable and not intrusive at all. I have this site whitelisted to help support their great work. You should consider it too before funding choices goes live. MJ There is certainly websites with much more obnoxious ads but their is a lot of ads on AP. It's just not an acceptable user experience and I not going to subject myself to it. I have been calling for a way to donate to AP for awhile now (why did AP have to wait for a Google solution?) so we see how this plays out. Zachary Dunn Ecommerce is hard. Most small outlets like AP prefer a platform that can handle the security and financial liability. MJ I am not talking about ecommerce but making donations. LOL Alex Dueppen Unfortunately Disqus hasn't been the same way, it seems to often load ads that redirect you to those scam "You are winner" pages that try to look like facebook. Adriannacsmith Google is paying 97$ per hour! Work for few hours & have longer with friends and family! !dy164c: On tuesday I got a great new Land Rover Range Rover from having earned $8752 this last four weeks.. Its the most-financialy rewarding I've had.. Follow this link for more information !dy164c: ➽➽ ➽➽;➽➽ http://GoogleFinancialCashJobs454MarketDriveGetPaid$97/Hour... ★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫::::::!dy164c:....,..... Maxr1998 I hope these cancerous, unblockable Outbrain ads will also be a part of the funding choices, then I'll happily pay - not that I wouldn't contribute anyway, because I feel a bit guilty for blocking ads for a long time already.. Eli Stevens I do the job from comfort and ease of my residence, participating in effortless activities that just require from you a Laptop together with internet access and I am just pleased than ever... After 6 months in this job and therefore managed to get remunerated in whole 36,000 usd... Mainly I get approximately 80 bucks/h and work for 3 to 4 hours constantly.And magnificent factor with this job is the fact that you can supervise time when you do the job and for just how long as you wish for and you attain a check week by week.>>>> learn by clicking here how to do it right now needa I use adguard. No outbrain. Just an empty spot above the comments section with sponsored content in one corner and recommended by Outbrain in another. Maxr1998 Hm, interesting. I'm using adaway, maybe I need to tweak my filter lists a little then.. NeverrKnowsBest I have gotten full screen malware ads from AP before. I did not want to block them, but they forced my hand. NexusPhan They did have a bad streak of ads for a while about a year ago. I remember that now that you say it. I enabled ad blocker for a few months after it happened. Corbin Davenport I will say that those are normally from Disqus, and we've worked with Disqus in the past to identify them and get them removed. ZettabyteGamer I'm sure it would be hard but if disqus is causing so many problems, maybe you should switch to a different comment section or make your own? needa They would just have to throw more ads up themselves to pay for it. Disqus is pretty good anyways. Not to mention Disqus is a way to get new people to come back to your site. Meaning some guy that already has a disqus acct, but found the site because he needs a new phone, can instantly comment without having to sign up for another account at another site. needa I never thought about Disqus throwing in ads. Sort of makes me feel like an idiot for not seeing what is right in front of me. Now it all makes sense. Thanks. Marcelove Would you work to remove the Outbrain and Taboola cancer networks too? Keep any of those at AP makes any other changes useless... tnt How can you tell what is from Disqus vs the site? Justin W I'd agree that AP's ads aren't bad, but Disqus's are terrible. Irwin LOL are you seriuos? on mobile, like half the site is all ads. It's ridiculous. blueman24 I'm ok with whitelist for sites like AP on desktop but on mobile, I don't want any ads. AP can add 5 more ads on their desktop site but don't cripple performance on my already slow phone. Marcelove Never while it still use Taboola or Outbrain as ads delivers... Both are cancers and any site promoting them shall stay adblocked... No matter how much I like a site, or as good it is, if it decides to use those networks... Doing that equals being automatically added and never removed from my blacklist and everyone should do that to enforce it is unacceptable... tnt I'm with you 100%. They're pure trash. Add Revcontent in there as well. wow Why are they "cancers"? I mean, from what I see outbrain ads are trashy and slow but I don't understand why that's an automatic blacklist for a site that provides quality content for free. Do they have malware or something? (This is referring to those fake news ads above the comment section, right?) EcE APK Mirror - - I do not feel guilty and will happily wait my 10 seconds rather than see 200 ads per page and pop ups (or whatever they are called which are basically the same) whenever I need an APK. Rashad Would it be a one time cost or is this a cost each time we visit a participating site? Corbin Davenport I believe it's a monthly subscription, just like the previous Contributor. MJ Questions? Why did AP have to wait for a Google solution? There are many ways you could have been collecting money all this time. A automatic monthly subscription? Sounds like a loser already as people hate that. It's not going to be a set amount but like pick an amount right? An annual subscription would make more sense. Why can't there just be a simple donate button so people could send money when they can and just continuing blocking the ads ourselves like we have been already doing? Cai Copley It's that you do it in one, centralized location for such a subscription, and not doing it over a series of sites and forgetting how much you're spending. MJ I guess need more details on how it works... Jeff Beck We'll have a special rate for you MJ. .005 cents per article, $15 per grumpy comment submitted. We are going to make a fortune off you ;) Maxr1998 Starting the day with a smile thanks to your witty comments. Thanks Jeff! :D George https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4ba5750c423a92daff44db461bb3042c433e0f5e7edc1f8dadcb32198db0d5e8.jpg Artem Russakovskii It's almost here. Just finishing final testing. Mark Curtis Or just block ads and not pay! I'm entitled to free content! gimme gimme gimme. faceless128 it's about safety. there are so many malicious advertisements out there. if a site doesn't directly control the ads that show up, how can they ensure our safety? Camerooni I use privacy badger.. if it blocks ads that play bad - I'm okay with that alongside blocking tracking cookies etc. What I don't like is sites assuming that if you're blocking an ad network that plays bad with you that you're the bad guy.. Things have to work both ways. Mark Curtis AdBlocking started way back when they were simple JPGs with no JavaScript at all. It could even go back to that and people would complain about having to download the bytes. Ailín Ó’S I wonder will this work internationally or just USA only because I use adblock and don't have AP (for example) whitelisted because of the sheer volume of ads on the site especially from the likes of Disqus with their "Congrats! You're a winner!" and "Local man makes 999.999€ a day with this trick!" spam. cadtek91 I'd imagine it would work with anyone with a Google account? Fabrice Thomas Seems like it's only available in these contries: US, Germany, New Zealand and UK https://support.google.com/contributor/answer/6182581?hl=en Jeff Beck If you want to just pay me directly I'll give you my PayPal address. That'll make things even easier on you. I know, I'm way too nice to you all, you're welcome. DavidW dogecoins or gtfo TechGuy22 Thanks but I'll stick adblock and adaway needa If you guys are wanting input, which I know you didn't ask for, five bucks a year would be my max. Not sure how it works, but I would want that on my mobile device. Desktop chrome has what I need in an extension. Ultimately that would earn more money from me, as i get on this sight far less with mobile chrome. Good_Ole_Pinocchio 5 bucks a year? What does that Pay for? Beer for the staff? needa If everyone that comes to this site with adblock paid five bucks, I doubt they would complain. Jeffrey Spiers Brave browser has this built into the browser directly, have used the feature on some of my most frequented sites. Switched to Brave due to many sites detecting and bitching about ad blockers recently. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Web Ads are trash, always. But I've never used ad blockers. Because if I'm taking the content, I'm taking the ads, or I just don't go to the site if the ads are really horrible. I'd more than pay for no ads. psy spy You have to sign in to your gmail account for this to work? Easier to track us. _jack_ It would be nicer to have this from another company, yes. I also wonder, how much Google keeps for themselves? Godspoken Would there even be a difference between you being signed in to your Google account with this vs without? You're using Android and Google services, I don't know what you'd expect. abc I don't browse from my phone so I'm rarely signed into Google, and this will blow some people's minds on this site - but some of us only use two or three Google apps/services, not the whole damn suite. Lord Argyris The official blurb is a little vague. Each time I visit a page without ads, my pass/account/whatever has the site's chosen cost deducted from it. What constitutes a "page"? If I refresh the tab, does that count as an additional page load? What if I visit an article again at a later date? What about those obnoxious sites that have an automatic reload timer? Could they game FC users? I'm sure all these questions will be answered in time. What I would have liked to have seen is some sort of a multiple tier system, whereby I can select specific participants (e.g AP) and offer to pay a flat monthly rate rather than a per-page fee, then leave the normal fee structure in place for others. It would be an easy way to donate more than I would ordinarily accumulate to places I come frequently, without forcing said sites to set up their own donation system. No matter what tier FC visitors choose, the site gets money. FelschR It's stated quite clearly: "Note: you are charged each time you visit or refresh a page, even if you have previously visited it." https://support.google.com/contributor/answer/7359560?hl=en&ref_topic=6182570 Lord Argyris Okay, that answers that. The blurb on the page linked in the article lacked that more detailed information. Matías Duarte I've only used AdBlock for AP the moment that those ads magically opened a new popup while scrolling without even touching them. Now that the annoying problem is gone, I've disabled it. I know no one cares about this but I finally got accepted for a job and I'll get my very first payment tomorrow, so I would happily pay a contribution for this page! Jeff Beck I'll be one to care. Congrats! Getting paid is awesome. At least that's what the other writers at AP tell me. Kostas 💪🎩 😂😂😂😂😂😂 imneveral0ne I just had a you're a winner one pop up on my phone with android police, so it's definitely not gone. ZettabyteGamer How long till I can use this with you guys? I'm itching to try it out, but this is the only site I really read everyday. Necdet Ali Özdür I think the real question here is what Google means by "fewer ads". Are all kinds of ads will be blocked or just intrusive ones? Will the trackers also be removed? someone755 Hmmm... https://youtu.be/4ezd24krgiQ Powsniffer0110 I'd be happy to pay 1¢ an article on AP and Phandroid, XDA ect.! Powsniffer0110 This is funny as hell lol. We're now paying Google to NOT give us ads... Haha. YaKillaCJ Or continue using AdAway, uBlock Origins and DNS Host Blocking via my router. Many can say what they want but my stance is simple. I won't pay just to "not be inconvenienced and intrused on". Any dev, content providers or ect can easily find many non intrusive ways to advertise. Just_No_Stop This whole situation could have been avoided if ads weren't so intrusive, ugly, malicious, irrelevant and numerous. Some pages use less than a tenth of the data with ads blocked, which is crazy, and any ad that slows the delivery of content is unacceptable. It still baffles me how such appalling ads can be effective, if they piss you off why would you then want the product? Paying not to have to put up with such things is not on, I will keep blocking until sites have better ad policies. dancedar1 'Google offering a $5 pass' reads as though they are giving you $5 credit to try it out - they're not; it's £/$5 minimum mattcoz I also read it that way. 4Ui812 1 cent per page isn't a sustainable business model once users realize how much money they'll blow through. Sites that depend on advertising would be better served by using some sort of royalties model like the way radio stations do with music and artists/labels. Otherwise ad blockers are here to stay.Of course Google will want they're cut. 4Ui812 I'd be willing to turn off my ad blocker and sign up Google Contributor/Funding Choices for the free $5 and then I'd blow it all on this site so you guys and gals can have the money. Once it's gone though my ad blocker will be turned back on :-) Ad blocker is used for security reasons. tmartin Will it remove that Outbrain chum? I really need that stuff to go away. needa I use adguard and there is not one single avertisement on this page. There is a spot for outbrain, but no ads. tmartin I use Ghostery mostly because of the chum and that takes care of it, but I wouldn't mind supporting AP. needa I wouldn't mind either. I turn my blocker off periodically to help out. From the looks of it Google will have the answers we need soon enough with their new chrome filter that they are working on. Hopefully then we will be able to support our favorite sites without being slowed down by the ads. Marcelove Wall Street Journal will use it or it will keep that aggressive paywall? Because allowing only 10 articles is like grabbing the print version, take only one sheet and give to someone saying "If you wanna read more than 1 sheet per month, you need to pay us". I'm not against a publisher using a paywall, but the restriction here is so absurd that even if I was 100% determined to subscribe, I wouldn't only because at this example the newspaper is being douchebag... 30 articles, or 1 per day, would really mean that it was caring about itself and the public... But only 10 shows that it don't give a f*ck about the public and is only caring about itself... Anthony Castanza This is a substantial regression from the old version. Morten Ulv How did the old one work? rap 1¢ per page would add up very fast. By the time I read a couple of favorite blogs each day that would be $20 per month. jdrch $0.01 per page sounds doable. Lars Jeppesen Not available in my countries... Gen. Chang The point is to force the ad industry and websites to change the way they operate. Not reward them for more bad behavior. If it was not for the privacy intrusive models they use, there would not be as big a problem.

According to Google, about 22% of gaming developers are women. This is why Google has teamed up with the Wonder Woman movie to launch a new coding project that is based around the movie as part of Google’s Made with Code initiative. This particular project will see kids code three unique scenes from the movie using introductory coding principles that will help Wonder Woman navigate obstacles and to reach her goal. According to Google, “Made with Code, Google’s initiative to champion the next generation of female leaders and inspire them to see coding as a way to pursue their dreams, is releasing a new interactive coding project for wonder women everywhere to add coding to their superpower toolkit.” It looks like a pretty fun project and while it is aimed at girls, we don’t see why the boys can’t join in on the fun as well. For those who are interested in checking it out, head on over to Made with Code’s website for the details. Filed in General. Read more about education, Google and Movies.

Select from one of these options to get in touch with us: Submit a Rumor Website Feedback Advertising Inquiry cancel 3K Fact Check Language Is 'Covfefe' Arabic for 'I Will Stand Up'? After President Donald Trump mistyped (then deleted) a tweet, some hurried to ascribe meanings to the mistyped word "covfefe." 3K CLAIM "Covfefe" means something, anything. FALSE RATING FALSE ORIGIN On 31 May 2017 President Trump send a late-night tweet that began with a complaint about his press coverage and ended with the non-word “covfefe,” baffling many. While “covfefe” jokes proliferated, some began speculating that Trump had not accidentally flubbed the word “coverage,” but instead had been speaking either in code or Arabic.  The #covfefe plot thickens: according to Google Translate, “Cov fe’fe” means سوف فقف “I will stand up” in Arabic. https://t.co/IhIUqQkc4u — Covfefe David Miles (@chrisdavidmiles) June 1, 2017 However, a little work with Google Translate shows that “covfefe” means nothing at all in Arabic. Only by turning it into two words and adding an apostrophe — cov fe’fe — one can create a phrase that Google Translate says means “I will stand up.”  That’s a bit of a stretch. On 2 June, The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee tweeted:  We have received many inquiries over the past few days. We can unequivocally say #covfefe is NOT an Arabic word. https://t.co/4xwJV7IIkP — ADC National (@adctweets) June 2, 2017 Variations: A separate rumor, this one published by The Marshall Report, held: Covfefe’ (pronounced “cuv – fee- fae”) is an Antediluvian term for “In the end we win.” It was commonly used by the sons of Adam to rail against the evil actions of the fallen who had led man astray. The term gained popularity prior to the great deluge and was rarely used after the flood subsided. It regained favor around the time Nimrod was building his tower, after which it was entirely lost in translation at Babel. The term “antediluvian” does not refer to a language, but a Biblical time period before the Flood. Needless to say, the writer, Dianne Marshall offered no proof for her claim. (The Marshall Report frequently uses “satirical” and fake articles as the bases for its posts.) Another rumor, posted to Facebook by one commenter and printed by the web site Godlike Productions held that word came from a Yiddish folktale about a rare butterfly:  A few people have asked me about President’s Trump’s tweet in which he used the word “covfefe.” Most people think he meant to write “coverage” and they have had quite a bit of fun with it, but actually it is a real word of Yiddish origin, meaning “a futile search” or “a pointless and false quest.” It was originally transliterated from the Hebrew as “kabfefe,” whose etymology is “kab”—relating to the mystical Qabalah—and “fefe,” which is a word for “butterfly.” What Trump was actually saying in Yiddish tweet-speak was, “We are doing great things despite the press’s negative and pointless search, aka fake news.” For those who are interested, the idea of “covfefe” comes from an old Yiddish tale about a foolish Sephardi rabbi who believed he was called to find and destroy the mythical and rare butterfly known as Benshariza, or “Lucifer butterfly”—a name that comes from “Helel ben Shahar,” meaning “shining star” (see Isaiah 14:12; also see Ephesians 2:2, where Satan is called the “prince of the power of the air”). The rabbi claimed that the Benshariza was recognizable by a unique and disturbing pattern on its huge wings, which looked like the moon and star symbol of the god Ba’al-Hadad. He was convinced that this ominous creature housed “the spirit of Satan” and that if he could destroy it, he would free the world of evil. We contacted Ben Kaplan, the Education Administrator at the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research, who told us by email, after consulting with colleagues:  The Yiddish language and literature scholars at the YIVO Institute confirm that “covfefe” is not a Yiddish word.  (However, an anonymous source warns against whispering it three times in the dark, in a mirror, during a full moon.) Isaac L. Bleaman, a PhD candidate and Yiddish scholar at New York University’s Linguistics Department added:  It is obviously a typo for “coverage.” I see no clear (or even unclear) connection to Yiddish. As for the legend cited, if you Google the string “kabfefe” there are only 45 results and all are either typos, or related to the covfefe incident. Nothing found in Google Books. So chances are it was made up. The only Yiddish word “covfefe” brings to mind is kopveytik ‘headache,’ but that would not make sense in the context of the tweet, and it is not an especially common borrowing into Jewish English. So Trump probably has never heard the word, and certainly wouldn’t use it in his English. We know from Trump’s use of “schlonged” in 2015 (a verb that he took from the Jewish English word for ‘penis’ that ultimately derives from the Yiddish noun shlang ‘snake’) that his use of Yiddish borrowings can be rather idiosyncratic. But I don’t think this is one of those Yiddishisms.  I’d sooner look for a Russian connection. “Covfefe” is not a word, nor is it a Nazi, Israeli, or any other type of acronym. It has no meaning. The President clearly mistyped a tweet, which he later deleted. Updated 2 June 2017 to include Yiddish variation.

Digital Trends Home > Home > Here's how to set up Alexa Calling and… Here's how to set up Alexa Calling and Messaging By Kyle Wiggers — Updated June 3, 2017 12:24 am Subscribe Share Amazon Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Google may have upstaged Amazon with the introduction of voice calling for Google Home, but the Echo isn’t without messaging tricks of its own. Alexa Calling & Messaging, which debuted earlier this year, lets you exchange memos between any two Echo devices, including the original Echo, Dot, and Tap. It works regardless of the distance between them — Amazon delivers messages between speakers on opposing continents the same way it delivers them to devices on the same Wi-Fi network. Better yet, they’re always free. Alexa’s calling features include Skype-like conferencing and automatic transcription and recording, and message recipients get the speech-to-text message readouts via the Alexa app for iOS and Android devices. However, some of these features take some time to get the hang of. Here’s everything you need to know to get started with Alexa Calling & Messaging. How to enable Calling & Messaging Amazon Calling & Messaging has a few prerequisites. First, you’ll need an Amazon Echo speaker — the original Echo or the Dot — along with an iOS device (running version 9.0 or higher) or an Android device (running Android 5.0 or higher). You’ll also need a valid phone number. Once you’ve checked those boxes, though, it’s relatively smooth sailing. If you haven’t already, download the Alexa app for iOS or Android. If you’re setting up an Echo speaker for the first time, follow the app’s step-by-step instructions to connect your Echo speaker to your Wi-Fi network, update its firmware, and enable features like Bluetooth. After that’s taken care of, you can get started with Alexa Calling: Open the Alexa app, and tap the speech bubble icon at the bottom of the screen. Here, you’ll see a welcome screen. Tap the Get Started button. Select your name from the list on the following screen. Then, hit the Continue button. You’ll be asked to grant Alexa permission to access your phone’s contacts. Tap Allow to continue. The Alexa app will prompt you to verify your phone number. Enter it, and then wait for the verification code. Paste the code in the corresponding text field and hit the Continue button. That’s it! You’ve successfully set up Alexa Calling & Messaging. How to send a voice message from the Alexa app Enabling calls and messages on your Echo devices is half the battle. Now, you have to learn how to use them. You can’t call just anyone. Unlike voice calls with Google Home, which can reach any landline or mobile phone, Alexa Calling & Messaging only works with other Amazon speakers. In addition, Echo owners who haven’t configured it aren’t reachable. Assuming at least one or two people in your phone’s contact list have a call-enabled Echo, here’s how to get started. Open the Alexa app, and tap the speech bubble at the bottom of the screen. This will bring up the Conversations screen. Tap the person-shaped outline in the upper-right corner of the screen, and choose a person from the resulting list of contacts. Tap the message bubble, which will bring up a conversation page with that contact. Then, hit the blue microphone icon to record a voice message. You can also tap the keyboard button to type out a memo. When your contact receives your message, they’ll hear a chime and the LED ring around the top of their Echo speaker will take on a green glow. If they have the Alexa app installed on their smartphone, they’ll also receive a notification simultaneously, and they’ll be able to view, play, and respond to your message from within the app’s Conversation screen. How to start a call from the Alexa app Once you’ve mastered the basics of sending messages to other Echo devices, placing a call should be a snap. Here’s how to call someone with the Alexa app: Open the Alexa app and tap the speech bubble at the bottom of the screen. This brings up the Conversations screen. Tap the person-shaped outline in the upper-right corner of the screen, and choose a person from the resulting list of contacts. Tap the phone icon, which will initiate the call. It’s a little like Skype — the Alexa app uses your phone’s microphone and speakers to route voice data over a Wi-Fi or cellular connection, and your voice comes through via the recipient’s Echo. If you receive another call while you’re on a call, the incoming call will go to a different Echo device that supposed calls and messages. How to send a voice message from an Echo Sending a message from an Echo device is even simpler than sending one from the Alexa app. First, make sure the message’s intended recipient has enabled Alexa Calling & Messaging by opening the Alexa app, heading to the Conversations screen, and tapping the person-shaped outline in the upper-right corner of the screen. If the person has enabled calls and messages, you’ll see their name on the resulting list. Now say, “Alexa, send a message to [your contact’s name here].” Alexa will then prompt you for your message. Say what you’d like to send, and that’s it! Amazon will take care of the rest. To listen to an incoming message on an Echo speaker, simply say, “Alexa, play the message.” You’ll then hear the newest, unread message in your inbox. How to start a call from an Echo speaker Making a call from an Echo speaker is just as easy as sending a message. First, make sure the message’s intended recipient has enabled Alexa Calling & Messaging by opening the Alexa app, heading to the Conversations screen, and tapping the person-shaped outline in the upper-right corner of the screen. If the person has enabled calls and messages, you’ll see their name on the resulting list. Now say, “Alexa, call [your contact’s name here].” You’ll be connected as soon as your partner answers. To answer an incoming call on an Echo speaker, simply say, “Alexa, answer the call. To end the same call, say, “Alexa, Hang up.” If you get another call while you’re on a call, the incoming call will go to a different Echo device that supports calls and messages. How to disable Calling & Messaging There’s a potential privacy issue with Amazon’s Calling & Messaging. As of right now, you can’t block incoming calls. Imagine if a telemarketer finds out how to contact you through your speaker. To disable the feature once you’ve enabled, it, you’ll have to call the helpline at 1-877-375-9365 or to the Contact Us page, choose Amazon Devices > your Echo name > Echo Devices. Under “Select issue details,” choose Something Else, then under “How Would You Like To Contact Us,” select Phone. An Amazon employee will call you.

Education Laurel Wamsley · NPR · May 31, 2017 Google published a map of most-searched-for spellings, by state. Google Trends via Twitter It's National Spelling Bee week! That wonderful time of year when we honor young Americans' spelling prowess and admire their chutzpah for memorization and sussing out the "dreaded schwa." Lest we get too highfalutin (boastful, bombastic, vainglorious), Google has published a map that demonstrates the opposite of spelling prowess (ineptitude, lack of skill, incompetence). It has mapped, state by state, the words that people most often Google "how to spell." We've made a few corrections to the legend. This is the one to use pic.twitter.com/0Z8fUlzmHc— GoogleTrends (@GoogleTrends) May 30, 2017 Many of us Google words to see how they're spelled. And perhaps we don't even type "how to spell" because we trust that Google will nudge us in the right direction even if we, ignoramuses that we are, typed "highfaluting." Thank goodness no one sees which words we perennially misspell, because it turns out that this information can be a little embarrassing, even when aggregated by state. We're looking at you, New Hampshire. The most-searched spelling in the Granite State is "diarrhea." And though that is not an easy word to spell and may be trickier than "disease," which is tops in Utah, or "patient," which gets Googled in Oklahoma, no one wants to be from the diarrhea state. Then there is South Dakota, where folks are searching "how to spell college." The jokes write themselves! Come on, Google, try a little subtlety. Some of these search terms raise larger questions. Why are so many Rhode Islanders trying to spell "liar"? How can it be that people in New Jersey can't spell "twelve"? And really, New Mexico: "banana"? Perplexingly, the word for which Wisconsinites most often need spelling help is: "Wisconsin." We hoped that maybe there was a lesser-known Badger fight song called "How to spell Wisconsin", i.e. "W-I-S-C-O-N-S-I-N for the win!" but no. There is no song. Perhaps this map reflects something deeper, something innate about what drives us, well beyond spelling's reach. Hawaii is about people, Vermont is Little Europe, and in Kansas, diamonds are forever.

And now, the Google Fiber customer service team wants you to experience the possibilities that the service has to offer-- with a store, called a Google Fiber Space. Photo Gallery View Gallery (10 images) Inline Inline Inline "Our customer service space is really a space where you can take Google Fiber for a spin and make it your own," said Caroline De Gantes, Google Fiber Business Operations. "You can experience what is super fast internet. What is a gigabit of speed, up to a thousand megabits per second. So you can stream some 4k videos to YouTube. You can come in, download a large file of data." And this Huntsville Google Fiber Space values local influence. They solicited a local artist to paint the mural in their store. “We painted a mural downtown, that big fish mural, and I guess someone at Google saw that and really liked it, and reached out to me," said Dustin Timbrook, the mural's artist. The opening of the store is just a preview of the growth and development that Huntsville can definitely anticipate. “This city is known for innovation, this is just one part of the innovation, and we’re really excited to see the innovation to come," De Gantes said.   Store hours of operation: Monday - Saturday: 10 a.m. – 7 p.m. Sunday: Closed Store address: 920 Bob Wallace Avenue SW Huntsville, AL 35801 *In the Shops at Merchants Walk shopping center, above Lululemon 34.711932 -86.586279 Filed in: News Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Email Popular Second person dies after pool incident in Florence Teenager’s body found after rescuers search Little River Canyon Huntsville Police make arrest in Thursday night murder, identify victim Latest News State Climatologist Reacts to President Donald Trump’s Decision to Withdraw From Paris Climate Agreement Will Your Driver’s License Work at Airports in 2018?

The car manufacturer announced that (previous CEO) Mike Fields would be replaced by Bill Hackett. This comes on the heels of partnership talks between Ford and Google falling apart. Bill Hackett, former big furniture guy, will take over Ford with a nervous board of directors throwing support behind him. Board members began to lose confidence in Fields and his ability to pull Ford in the right direction after losing a potential partnership with Google, and the Mexico factory debacle last year. When the decision was made to promote the newly-hired Bill Hackett from the company’s Smart Mobility division, it sent a clear message. The future of Ford is not in individual car sales. Currently Ford’s Fleets are where the company makes it’s money and with the driverless car on the horizon they are poised to break into the ride-sharing market. When Ford enters the ride-sharing market they’ll be bringing a fleet of cars that can bypass the 3rd party. Driverless vehicles will give Ford control from concept to consumer use. This is where the company will find it’s market share. Ford doesn’t have to compete with other ride-sharing programs, unless those other companies also design and manufacture their own vehicles (which Uber is working on). With driverless cars there aren’t external employees or 3rd party companies operating the equipment. The Ford driverless car fleet will be an in-house program. The future Ford Focus doesn’t want to live in your garage. It wants to pick you up for work and then go back to its loving home where properly trained Ford techs will attend to its every need. CEO Bill Hackett is going to have to steer Ford forward using the same ideas that the company was founded on. He’ll have to use cutting edge technology to mass produce something people are going to need. The driverless car presents new challenges and new opportunities. While experts try and work out the grid, visionaries are trying to determine the best possible uses. The world of tomorrow gives those who can’t or don’t drive the opportunity to travel without using public transportation. Driverless cars can empower the handicapped, free up the time workers spend commuting, and make the streets safer. Current ride-sharing services don’t reach everywhere – and driverless cars are going to be even less common until they become more mainstream. While Google and other tech companies are designing the tech that drives the driverless car – Ford is poised to take the first workable version and create swarming fleets of supercars, or at least thousands of tiny Ford Focus’ scurrying through every major throuroughfare like red blood cells through arteries. Ford might be the first of the major car companies to start testing driverless car fleets on a large scale – but others will surely follow suit. Tesla and Ford have been playing a game of one-upsmanship with the electric car and Toyota recently began exploring new options for it’s driverless car division. When Ford unveils its driverless car fleet it will be responsible for things that consumers normally have to worry about; fuel, maintenance, insurance and parking. Garages will be used for punk rock bands and storing boxes that say ‘old clothes’ on them. In the future we’ll be able to relax in a Ford Focus and watch movies on the way to work — we’ll probably watch Gone In 60 Seconds and tweet about the good ole’ days when people really knew how to drive.

Learn more Again? Some men got so bent out of shape over movie theaters hosting women-only screenings of the superhero flick Wonder Woman that they whined on social media that it was reverse discrimination. (This one is suing. Seriously.) Nobody tell them that on Thursday, Google released a Wonder Woman-themed update and an interactive project specifically designed to teach girls how to code. “Wonder Woman continues to be a symbol of female empowerment, breaking through stereotypes pervasive in comic books, gaming, and pop culture,” Google wrote in an announcement on its blog. The company’s Wonder Woman update to the game “DC Legends” is available on Google Play and will tie in content from the movie and allow players to “select Wonder Woman and channel her strength while they play.” Only 22 percent of gaming developers are women. The hope is that these girls will play the game and then be inspired to take on the interactive Wonder Woman-based coding project from Made With Code, Google’s initiative that works to boost the computer programming prowess of middle and high school age girls. Through the project, girls will be able to “code three unique scenes from the film, using introductory coding principles to help Wonder Woman navigate obstacles and reach her goal.” Google seems to understand what the men complaining about women-only film screenings might not want to admit: Gender inequality is alive and well in Hollywood and the tech industry. The company wrote on its blog “that girls are less likely than boys to be encouraged to pursue computer science and only 22 percent of gaming developers are women.” Oh, and Warner Brothers, the studio behind the film, has teamed up with Google to host a screening in Los Angeles just for girls. This might be proof that, when it comes to Wonder Woman, neither Warner Brothers nor Google are here for the reverse discrimination complaints.   Hero screenshot via Warner Brothers Recently on GOOD Education Strangers On A Delayed Train Hold A Heartwarming ‘Graduation’ Ceremony Gotham’s residents are the softies we always knew they were Education Liz Dwyer My Student Wrote ‘My Brother Dead.’ I Corrected His Grammar I told myself that compassion was an occupational hazard—until a frightening incident changed everything When compassion is an occupational hazard Education Gila Lyons The Heartbreaking (And Totally Preventable) Reason This Teacher Of The Year Quit Since 2009, cuts to Oklahama's education budgets have totaled over $1 billion Education Liz Dwyer These Are The Most Misspelled Words In Every State Only two states can claim "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"  Education Liz Dwyer This Service Dog In A High School Yearbook Is The Cutest Thing Ever Someone’s been a very good boy Education Kate Ryan Engineers May Earn Fat Paychecks—But Not Every Kid Is Meant To Be One A university admissions expert takes on America’s obsession with the notoriously stressful field Education Jackie Sizemore Spotify's Data Dump Just Revealed The Hidden Truth About Today's College Students What we listen to reveals a lot more than we realized Education Liz Dwyer The Strategy To Get More Military Service Members A College Degree A passing score on a 90-minute exam makes a path to a diploma Education Jonathan Smith High School Girls Invent A Straw That Detects Date-Rape Drugs It detects date rape drugs Education Tod Perry What's this? return to good.is About Advertise Contact Shop FAQ Newsletter Subscribe Terms Privacy Careers ©2017 GOOD Worldwide Inc Never miss another GOOD thing.

Apple has begun production of a high-end speaker with Siri-based digital assistant technology to compete directly with Amazon's Alexa-based Echo speakers and the Google Assistant-powered Home speaker, Bloomberg reported Wednesday. Production is in the early stages, but the device could be unveiled as early as next week at WWDC, Apple's annual developer conference, according to the report. That would position the company to begin shipping in time for the winter holiday season. Inventec, which manufactures Apple AirPods, reportedly has landed the deal to build the intelligent speakers, and has begun expanding plant capacity to handle the demand. Apple aims to position its speaker not only as a digital assistant for the home, but also as a high-end audio device that will compete with Sonos and other leading speaker manufacturers, according to some reports. Apple already is a dominant player in the digital music arena with its iTunes music and video library. The device currently in production will have virtual surround sound technology and possibly will include sensors that automatically adjust volume based on the acoustics where the speakers are being used, according to the Bloomberg report. It also may use the company's HomeKit, which already works with Siri technology to automate the home, to act as a hub for home appliances, lights and other devices. <a href="//us-ads.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=45628437ae&amp;cb=14966396921300" ><img src="//us-ads.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=538762537&amp;cs=45628437ae&amp;cb=14966396921300" border="0" alt="" /></a> Street Talk Speculation about the launch of a Siri-based speaker has heated up in recent weeks, following last month's report from KGI Securities analyst Ming Chi Kuo, who said there was a greater than 50 percent chance that Apple would unveil such a device at WWDC, which would give developers time to write new apps for it in time for the holiday shopping season. Apple had an installed base of 136 million iPhones in use in the U.S. as of March 31, plus another few million iPads and Apple computers. Most of the company's customers owned more than one Apple product, according to Michael Levin, a partner and analyst at Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. "It has also created a decent Home software suite that would allow whatever gadget they create to integrate its various hardware products -- smartphone, tablet, watch, computers, etc. -- into a home control system," he told the E-Commerce Times. "We expect that over time, at least a few million U.S. users would try out its new service and become a competitor to Amazon Echo and Google Home devices." Apple TV Groundwork Apple currently has some of same type of capability found in smart speakers built into its Apple TV box, noted Michael Jude, a research manager at Stratecast/Frost & Sullivan. "This would likely be an adjunct device that would network to the existing Apple Home capabilities," he told the E-Commerce Times. "Apple has been angling towards a connected home capability for some time," Jude remarked. "Apple TV was sort of the opening salvo, but had a hard time getting traction because of its dependence on resolving content ownership issues," he explained. The rumored Siri-powered speaker "will extend Apple's capabilities, but will still be a less capable offering than Amazon's since it will lack the retail connections that Amazon can deliver," Jude said. "It will, however, put it at parity with Google -- perhaps ahead a little, since it will deliver iTunes and other content sources. Third Parties Key The strength of the Apple brand alone would provide the company with a competitive advantage with fans of the company, noted Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. However, unless the company were willing to open the platform up to third-party developers and hardware providers, it would lag Amazon and Google, he pointed out. "While being first to market with a home speaker device -- the Echo -- was a plus for Amazon, its real success is coming from all the third-parties that are looking at using Alexa on everything from smoke detectors to cars," McGregor told the E-Commerce Times. "Amazon also has a vast music library, book library and other retail ties to customers," he pointed out. "I would not bet against Amazon." Maturing Market Apple's move comes at a time when the core iPhone market has begun to mature. At the same time, Amazon and Google have taken a big bite out of the red hot digital assistant market. The Echo has propelled Amazon to record revenue and profits over the last couple of years, spinning off an entire new ecosystem of products that use its Alexa-based digital assistant technology. Google launched its own ecosystem of products and services anchored by the Google Assistant-powered Home speaker. It has a treasure trove of consumer search data and natural language capabilities to drive the use of Android-based mobile phones and other products based on its advanced development of machine learning and artificial intelligence.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 2 June 2017 by Maciej Heyman With Facebook, Microsoft and Google emphasizing Artificial Intelligence will Apple be next iCrowdNewswire – Jun 2, 2017 With iPhone sales slowing and the last new Apple product released two years ago, expectations are building for what the company will reveal next week at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference. Some Apple watchers are counting on artificial intelligence. With Facebook, Microsoft and Google emphasizing AI in their conferences over the past two months, market analysts believe it is Apple’s turn. As the race for artificial intelligence heats up in Silicon Valley, some worry that Apple is already behind the game. “If Apple skips AI, I would consider that a significant miss on their opportunity,” said John Jackson, a Boston-based analyst for IDC. “Apple is late to this game. There is no other trick up their sleeve around this.” Apple, long known for its secrecy, declined to discuss specifics of the event but emailed a statement that its global developer community has earned more than $70 billion since the App Store launched in 2008. Rumors and early reports indicate the Cupertino tech giant may release a new iPad pro, and according to Bloomberg, a Siri-controlled home speaker to challenge Amazon Echo and Google Home. Gene Munster, a venture capitalist at Loup Ventures and a longtime Apple watcher, said a home speaker would be a step in the right direction for Apple. “Artificial intelligence is fundamental to every company now,” Munster said. “We knew Apple was going to improve on Siri, and (the speaker) seems to line up. It makes logical sense.” In addition to the Siri speaker, rumors of a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro, a 12.9-inch iPad Pro 2, an updated MacBook Pro and a new iOS 11 have circulated on the Internet In preparation for next week’s Apple Developers Conference, the McEnery Convention Center facade gets a decorative re-skinning Friday, June 2, 2017, in San Jose, Calif. (Karl Mondon/Bay Area News Group)  The five-day conference to be attended by more than 5000 developers — who each paid $1599 after winning a lottery — is moving from San Francisco to San Jose, where it will be held for the first time since 2002. Apple CEO Tim Cook will give the keynote speech in McEnery Convention Center at 10 a.m. on Monday. His speech will be streamed live on Apple’s website, or through the WWDC iOS app. Some experts pushed back on the notion that Apple is behind in the AI race, saying Siri is not the only AI-driven technology built by Apple. But they acknowledged that companies like Amazon and Google have made smart AI-driven devices marketable — Google identifies itself as an AI first company — as Apple has mostly worked behind closed curtains. “For the average Joe on the street, AI for Amazon is Echo and Alexa,” said Carolina Milanesi, analyst at Creative Strategies. “Apple just chose not to label everything AI. Apple chose to let our experience with its devices speak for itself. But I think we are at a point where AI does matter in the advertising spiel.” In recent years, Apple has seen a decline in the sales of its main products, most noticeably the iPhone. Apple reported 50.8 million iPhones sold worldwide in the second quarter of 2017, down from 51.2 million a year earlier. Expectations are that Apple will unveil a new iPhone in the fall for the device’s 10th anniversary. Apple Watch, its latest product from 2015, saw its 2016 sales number double from the year before, according to Cook in the last earnings call. Apple does not release Apple Watch sales numbers, but some analysts have estimated about 12 million of the devices were sold last year. If reports of a Siri home speaker are correct, Apple will be entering a growing smart home market with a closing window of opportunity. Both Amazon Echo and Google Home proved to be commercial successes. At its I/O conference in May, Google announced more features to its Home speaker, including the ability to place free calls, connect with Bluetooth and control more apps like HBO Now and Hulu. Apple’s Siri speaker reportedly comes with a virtual surround sound technology that give it an edge in sound quality over its competitors, according to Bloomberg. But the biggest draw may be its compatibility with other Apple devices and services. The speaker will likely be connected to the iPhone and Apple TV and services like Apple Music and the HomeKit home automation system. Although skeptical that current Amazon Echo owners will switch over to the Apple speaker, analysts believe Apple may be able to bridge the gap. “Apple has done a great job sewing up households as Apple households,” said Jackson. “A lot of us own iPhones and MacBooks. But it hasn’t been central to their messaging. Creating this type of innovation is darn hard, so they’re late.” Full article: http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/06/02/apple-needs-to-show-off-new-ai-technology-at-wwdc-next-week-analysts-say/ CategoriesUncategorized Tags(North America, Apple, artificial intelligence, Artificial Intelligence Newswire, Asia, English, Europe, Facebook, Google, Latin America, Microsoft, Middle East Post navigation Previous PostPrevious Fayetteville Historic District Commission Presents 2017 Historic Preservation Award Next PostNext Public Outreach Policy at the Planning Commission Meeting Posted on 2 June 2017 by Maciej Heyman With Facebook, Microsoft and Google emphasizing Artificial Intelligence will Apple be next iCrowdNewswire – Jun 2, 2017 With iPhone sales slowing and the last new Apple product released two years ago, expectations are building for what the company will reveal next week at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference.

Gene Munster, a venture capitalist at Loup Ventures and a longtime Apple watcher, said a home speaker would be a step in the right direction for Apple. “Artificial intelligence is fundamental to every company now,” Munster said. “We knew Apple was going to improve on Siri, and (the speaker) seems to line up. It makes logical sense.” In addition to the Siri speaker, rumors of a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro, a 12.9-inch iPad Pro 2, an updated MacBook Pro and a new iOS 11 have circulated on the Internet In preparation for next week’s Apple Developers Conference, the McEnery Convention Center facade gets a decorative re-skinning Friday, June 2, 2017, in San Jose, Calif. (Karl Mondon/Bay Area News Group)  The five-day conference to be attended by more than 5000 developers — who each paid $1599 after winning a lottery — is moving from San Francisco to San Jose, where it will be held for the first time since 2002. Apple CEO Tim Cook will give the keynote speech in McEnery Convention Center at 10 a.m. on Monday. His speech will be streamed live on Apple’s website, or through the WWDC iOS app. Some experts pushed back on the notion that Apple is behind in the AI race, saying Siri is not the only AI-driven technology built by Apple. But they acknowledged that companies like Amazon and Google have made smart AI-driven devices marketable — Google identifies itself as an AI first company — as Apple has mostly worked behind closed curtains. “For the average Joe on the street, AI for Amazon is Echo and Alexa,” said Carolina Milanesi, analyst at Creative Strategies. “Apple just chose not to label everything AI. Apple chose to let our experience with its devices speak for itself. But I think we are at a point where AI does matter in the advertising spiel.” In recent years, Apple has seen a decline in the sales of its main products, most noticeably the iPhone. Apple reported 50.8 million iPhones sold worldwide in the second quarter of 2017, down from 51.2 million a year earlier. Expectations are that Apple will unveil a new iPhone in the fall for the device’s 10th anniversary. Apple Watch, its latest product from 2015, saw its 2016 sales number double from the year before, according to Cook in the last earnings call. Apple does not release Apple Watch sales numbers, but some analysts have estimated about 12 million of the devices were sold last year. If reports of a Siri home speaker are correct, Apple will be entering a growing smart home market with a closing window of opportunity. Both Amazon Echo and Google Home proved to be commercial successes. At its I/O conference in May, Google announced more features to its Home speaker, including the ability to place free calls, connect with Bluetooth and control more apps like HBO Now and Hulu. Apple’s Siri speaker reportedly comes with a virtual surround sound technology that give it an edge in sound quality over its competitors, according to Bloomberg. But the biggest draw may be its compatibility with other Apple devices and services. The speaker will likely be connected to the iPhone and Apple TV and services like Apple Music and the HomeKit home automation system. Although skeptical that current Amazon Echo owners will switch over to the Apple speaker, analysts believe Apple may be able to bridge the gap. “Apple has done a great job sewing up households as Apple households,” said Jackson. “A lot of us own iPhones and MacBooks. But it hasn’t been central to their messaging. Creating this type of innovation is darn hard, so they’re late.” Full article: http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/06/02/apple-needs-to-show-off-new-ai-technology-at-wwdc-next-week-analysts-say/ CategoriesUncategorized Tags(North America, Apple, artificial intelligence, Artificial Intelligence Newswire, Asia, English, Europe, Facebook, Google, Latin America, Microsoft, Middle East Post navigation Previous PostPrevious Fayetteville Historic District Commission Presents 2017 Historic Preservation Award Next PostNext Public Outreach Policy at the Planning Commission Meeting Posted on 2 June 2017 by Maciej Heyman With Facebook, Microsoft and Google emphasizing Artificial Intelligence will Apple be next iCrowdNewswire – Jun 2, 2017 With iPhone sales slowing and the last new Apple product released two years ago, expectations are building for what the company will reveal next week at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference.

 YOUR E-MAIL VERIFICATION CODE Mining user data, internet giants can be very greedy and even more tightfisted when it comes to paying taxes. Many of them are already in hot water in the EU, Russia and Australia, being investigated for unpaid taxes and collecting user data The economy ushered in by the internet, social media and mobile applications are affecting trade all around the world. While local internet companies are unable to run away from regulation and taxation, world giants are taking refuge in user habits to exempt themselves. The recent TL 300 million ($84.83 million) tax penalty imposed on Google by Turkey has brought this issue to the agenda once again. In fact, the problem is not specific to Turkey. Companies like Uber, Airbnb, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft and Google, in particular, are all in trouble with local authorities and regulatory agencies, across the globe, regarding tax payments and user data. The Irish operation of the giants like Facebook, Google and Microsoft is a constantly debated issue. Despite making most of their money in wealthy European Union (EU) states, these companies base themselves in countries like Ireland and Luxembourg, in order to unfairly benefit from the low amount of taxes in those countries. This is being considered as a major problem. Problem in the house These internet behemoths lobby individually as well as collectively under the roof of the EU alone. Moreover, the U.S., which supports these companies abroad, does not hesitate to bother them in regards to local politics. Companies that operate in countries like Luxembourg and Ireland for taxation advantages do the same in the U.S. and carry their official hubs to places that offer tax advantages. For instance, Apple chooses a small office in Nevada, a tax-favored place in Reno, a small town hundreds of miles away, but, not in California, where the company's management buildings are in Cupertino, which issues a high corporate rate. Collection of personal data Internet companies which have grown especially through advertising revenue on the internet have records of both tax and personal data. Facebook founder Zuckerberg got into trouble regarding the data he obtained from the school, during his company's establishment phase. Local enterprises argue that the internet giants are going unchecked and it is necessary to apply positive discrimination towards them. Even companies that complain about the fact that internet giants do not make investments in Turkey allocate a significant part of their digital advertising expenditures to these channels. In other words, not only state and regulatory institutions, but also all institutions should show similar sensitivities. Is personal data protected? Although a law on protecting personal data in Turkey has been issued, questions on following up and applying sanctions still remain unanswered. Social media and internet giants that are developing mobile applications are more reluctant to apply regulations and laws in terms of content than local firms. Think about it, a social media company boasting 30 million users here does not even have an office in Turkey. Australia, EU in pursuit of taxes The EU and Australia are giving no respite to global internet giants over taxes. They do not hesitate to impose massive penalties on companies that collect data in exchange of free services they offer to consumers and benefit from the digital advertising market and try to gather investments in their native countries. Social networking applications and search services, which have become a part of millions of people's lives in Turkey, have changed their habits of doing business. Time for games to take off from Turkey Recently, we have seen initiatives from Turkey making their marks in the gaming market. Voidrunner, Turkey's most comprehensive independent computer gaming project, initiated by StartersHub and produced by RealityArts Studio, will come to online gaming platform and marketplace, Steam. Voidrunner, a flight game that offers both multi-player and single-player modes with artificial intelligence, opens the gates to different worlds for the players, with its advanced graphics and comfortable gameplay. Having received a positive response from Steam, in just 3 days, Voidrunner has met players on Steam with Turkish language support on May 1. Voidrunner, with the support of Unreal Engine's manufacturer Epic Games, is successfully representing Turkey abroad and will publish its single-player Virtual Reality mode in just a few weeks. The developers are also working on the Playstation 4 version. Meanwhile, other innovations and additional features will continue to be produced for Voidrunner, and all patches and innovations will be offered for free. With a special price of TL 15, RealityArts presents our country's game sector with a rich gaming experience full of rich content, servers and single modes with artificial intelligence.

There’s efforts to change that, such as the non-profit that made a new podcasting app with all its links, buttons and instructions in the various languages of Iran, as we previously reported. The idea was to encourage an Iranian audience to connect with the broader world by making it as easy as possible for people there to navigate the plethora of audio on-demand content. With all the startups out there trying to hack growth, find new users and put out press releases about being the “fastest growing” Uber-for-Chalupas (or whatever), onlookers might assume that making products available in different languages would be one of the most obvious paths to growth. That’s not how it works, though. Even companies that are founded by non-English speaking teams design user interfaces in English, because the American market is still seen as the most valuable. Google and Udacity would like to see a web that’s friendlier to users all over the globe, but localizing an app isn’t as simple as running all the words through a free translator, so Google announced on its developers’ blog Wednesday that it has collaborated with the online learning company to build a free course on making the web comprehensible worldwide. “Today, localization is becoming more and more important because the internet user base is growing rapidly, especially in non-English speaking countries,” Bert Vander Meeren, Director of Localization at Google, says in the blog post. Localization Essentials is a free, beginner-level course on Udacity that the site estimates takes about two weeks. See Googlers describe it while making a stilted West Wing‘esque walk through Alphabet offices in this trailer: Alban Denoyel is the co-founder of a French startup called SketchFab, which makes it easy to view 3-D designs on 2-D screens. We recently reported on forays into WebVR. Even though its creators are French, all the words used on SketchFab’s product are in English. Its monolingual user interface is easy to explain—SketchFab has a small team and localizing takes a lot of work. “The product is hopefully simple enough to use even with very limited English knowledge,” he wrote the Observer in an email. “It speaks for itself that only 20 percent of our users are in the US, without localisation.” Meanwhile, Google has a whole localization team, enough to make its many apps in 70 languages. Team members built the course for Udacity, using the company’s very multimedia approach to online learning. Startups probably won’t be able to localize in quite so many places any time soon, but a company might be able to peel off a piece of a fresh funding round to swing a few more languages. Efforts like that make the world smaller and the web more accessible.

The announcement comes as hundreds of millions of Internet users have already installed ad blockers on their desktop computers and phones to combat ads that track them and make browsing sites difficult. These blockers threaten websites that rely on digital ads for revenue. Google’s version will allow ads as long as websites follow industry-created guidelines and minimize certain types of ads that people really hate. That includes pop-up ads, huge ads that don’t go away when visitors scroll down a page and video ads that start playing automatically with the sound on. Google says the feature will be turned on by default, and users can turn it off. It will work on both the desktop and mobile versions of Chrome. Google says that even ads it sells will be blocked on websites that don’t get rid of annoying types of ads. Latest business videos But there might not be vast changes online triggered by the popular browser’s efforts. It’s a “small number of websites that are disproportionately responsible for annoying user experiences,” Google spokeswoman Suzanne Blackburn said. “I’m sure there are some publishers who will get hurt,” said Brian Wieser, an ad analyst with Pivotal Research Group. But in the long term, he says, cracking down on irritating ads should make the Internet experience better, encouraging people to visit sites and click on links. That, in turn, benefits Google. The company is also starting a program that could help publishers deal with users who have downloaded popular ad blockers. Some individual websites have come up with their own countermeasures. Forbes.com, for example, won’t let you read stories without disabling your ad blocker or logging in with Facebook or Google accounts, so the site can track you. Google would work with websites to set up messages telling users to disable their blockers for the site or pay for a version of it with no ads. It will take a 10 percent cut of those payments. To protect its ad business, Google has tried to improve user experiences in other ways. It launched a way for websites to load faster on phones. And it used its sway as the dominant search engine to push companies to make their sites mobile-friendly. Such sites show up higher in mobile searches. Google also has tried to address advertisers’ concerns about their ads running next to offensive content by banning its ads from some objectionable videos on YouTube, like those that promote discrimination or advocate illegal drug use. Google also won’t place its ads on Web pages with objectionable content — porn, for example, and or sites that promote suicide or violence. Facebook, too, is trying to make links from inside its universe less spammy for users. It says it’s trying to cut down on posts and ads in the news feed that lead to junky pages with “little substantive content” and “disruptive, shocking or malicious ads.” Tali Arbel is an Associated Press writer.

Google is inviting the public to do so using super-fast Internet speeds at its new customer service center near downtown Huntsville. The permanent space opened today above Lululemon Athletica at the Whole Foods-anchored Shops at Merchants Walk, allowing guests to experience the speeds for themselves before they sign up. Since debuting fiber-optic Internet, TV and phone service in north Huntsville last week, Google Fiber has been fielding questions about when they will expand to other areas in the city. "The scientists and engineers in this community really understand the value of super-fast Internet and they've really shown a great response coming out here," said Caroline de Gantes, head of business operations for Google Fiber Huntsville. Google hosted a pop-up shop in the parking lot of Merchants Walk before debuting the permanent space on 920 Bob Wallace Ave. S.W., Suite 323. The center is open from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday through Saturday and closed Sunday. Prices start at $50 a month for fiber Internet cable at speeds up to 100 megabits per second (Mbps) and go to $160 a month for gigabit Internet and 220 channels of TV. Phone service is $10 extra on any plan. The first area getting service is bounded on the west by Pulaski Pike and covers all of Huntsville north of Interstate 565 to the eastern city limits. de Gantes said residents should sign up on fiber.google.com/cities/huntsville to receive the latest updates. "We're thrilled this city that is built on innovation gets the value of super-fast Internet and we're thrilled to be offering more choices to the residents of Huntsville," she said. Artist Dustin Timbrook designed the mural inside the new Google Fiber customer service center in Huntsville. (Courtesy) Google operates similar customer service centers in cities where fiber-optic service is available. The Alabama location features a mural designed by Dustin Timbrook, a Huntsville artist and the creative director for Red Brick Strategies. Timbrook said Google contacted him about creating a design for their fiber installation vans after seeing his koi fish mural in downtown Huntsville. They later asked him to develop a mural for the customer service center. "With the van I had a bunch of really Huntsville-specific stuff cobbled together," Timbrook said. "With this one, I wanted one big bold image and it needed to be about space because it's Huntsville. Instead of showing the Saturn V, which we always do in everything, I gave the space shuttle some love." Timbrook and his girlfriend, Molly Kitts, were the first customers to sign up for Google Fiber after a press event last week in Huntsville. The service has not been installed yet because the couple lives on Grove Avenue north of downtown, but they are excited about the opportunity. He is also looking forward to having fiber-optic Internet at Red Brick's office on Northside Square, where he often handles large video files. "It's totally exciting," he said. "I'm very appreciative that Google Fiber wants to work with local artists and support that community."

(AAP) Previous Next Show Grid Previous Next Hide Grid Image 1/ Video Audio Along with Netflix, the other members of the so-called "FANG" quartet of internet stocks - Facebook, Amazon and Google - each saw solid gains on the US market. Source: AAP 3 Jun 2017 - 11:52 AM  UPDATED 3 Jun 2017 - 11:52 AM Tweet Netflix's stock climbed to a record high to close at $US165.18 ($A222.03) per share, up 1.3 per cent for the day, riding the wave of tech investors' bullishness on large-cap internet company stocks. Along with Netflix, the other three members of the so-called "FANG" quartet of internet stocks - Facebook, Amazon and Google (Alphabet) - each saw solid gains. Amazon crested the magical $US1,000-per-share mark to close on Friday at $US1,006.73 (up 1.1 per cent); Facebook was up 1.4 per cent to $US153.61; and Alphabet increased 0.9 per cent, to $US975.60 per share. But could Netflix investors also have been responding to the streaming leader's cancellation of two high-profile - and expensive - original series, Sense8 and The Get Down? While those actions could help assure Wall Street that Netflix is maintaining a sense of fiscal discipline, analysts warned against making too strong a connection. "I would hesitate to infer any direct correlation between the cancellation of those two series and Netflix's recent share price performance, which also seems to have benefited in part from a broader market rally," said Tuna Amobi, director of equity research at CFRA Research. The rise of Netflix's stock in recent weeks has been fuelled by expectations of international growth and the overall market movement toward high-growth internet stocks. "Everyone is looking for growth and shorting secular losers," said MoffettNathanson principal analyst Michael Nathanson. It's also worth noting that given Netflix's overall content spending, expected to top $US6 billion this year, even two relatively pricey shows are just a fraction of the total. Indeed, CEO Reed Hastings indicated that if anything, Netflix is willing to take more shots on goal by continuing to place creative bets on the original programming front. "You should have more things that don't work out, you have to get more aggressive," he said this week at the Code Conference. "The drive toward conformity as you grow is more substantial. As a leader, you want to drive people to take more risks."

Google isn't leaving users out in the cold, though, with new ad blocking features to improve the Google experience.  ( Justin Sullivan | Getty Images ) During the annual I/O event, Google announced new features coming to the search engine that are very advertiser-friendly. Google hasn't left users out in the cold and has announced a new ad blocking system to improve the Google experience. Google Blocking Google has announced plans to introduce a new ad blocker for Chrome on desktop and mobile by 2018. The new ad blocker will target ads that it believes cause a bad experience for Chrome users when online. It's important to note that the new feature won't block all ads, but will target any that are considered intrusive or annoying to the user experience. These include pop-up ads that take up the entire screen or autoplayed videos with sound. The blocker will even target Google ads if they fall into those categories as well. "We plan to have Chrome stop showing ads (including those owned or served by Google) on websites that are not compliant with the Better Ads Standards starting in early 2018," Sridhar Ramaswamy, Google's Senior VP of Ads and Commerce, said in a blog post. For anyone unfamiliar with the Better Ads Standards, it's the accepted practices when it comes to online advertising for members of the Coalition for Better Ads. The group was formed in 2016 with Google, Facebook, Unilever, and several other media and advertisement groups with the intent of finding a balance between the user experience and acceptable advertising. To help prep for this, Google will offer publishers what is referred to as an "Ad Experience Report." With it, publishers will be able to get a better grasp on Better Ads Standards to address intrusive ads on their own websites. Give-And-Take This seems like a necessary addition to Google's features, especially given the string of announcements at Google I/O in May. One such feature was the ability to track offline purchases to see if online ads were at all effective, allowing ad companies to adjust the ads appearing on Google to fit the user. While this new feature won't get rid of all ads, it does show that Google isn't so focused on the advertisers to alienate users. That said, there is a level of selfishness behind this as well. More and more people are using ad blockers on Google and YouTube to get around them and get straight to the content. Unfortunately for Google, ads are one of its main sources of revenue, so ad blockers definitely force Google to take a hit. With this new blocker, it at least gives Google a chance to still see some revenue from ads instead of nothing at all. TAG Google Chrome, Ad Blocking © 2017 Tech Times, All rights reserved.

Malware poses the biggest threat to online security—and Google knows this, and is stepping up plans to secure its email services. The tech giant has announced that it will improve the security level of its email service, Gmail, by introducing a couple of new features. While doing so, the Mountain View California-based tech giant has promised to also improve on existing ones. Again, Google is tapping from the ability of machine learning to secure Gmail services. It’s everybody’s favorite these days—and no wonder Google is relying on it to combat phishing, especially at its early stages. The tech giant will rely on the ability of machine learning to detect malware attacks on its email service, Writing in a blog post a couple of days back, Google said: “Machine learning has helped Gmail achieve more than 99% accuracy in spam detection, and with these new protections, we’re able to reduce your exposure to threats by confidently rejecting hundreds of millions of additional messages every day.” No kidding—Google wants your mind to be at peace when using Gmail. It is stepping up Gmail’s security by rolling out click-time warnings for malicious links. It will also implement warnings to users whenever they want to act on unintended external replies, Softpedia reports. To this end, the company says it has upgraded its defenses against attachments that malicious. From past experience, Google has discovered that scammers tried to use crafty email attachments to creep past its security filters. Some of the measures the company took in such situations include rejecting such messages and informing the sender of the presence of virus in an email, and preventing users from sending messages with attachments that have been infected. In the case of infected attachments, Google prevented them from being downloaded. G Suite users, according to Google’s announcement, will now be warned by the new tool when replying to emails sent from outside of their territories or those not in their contact lists. This new tool has been added to Gmail as an extra layer of security to make sending and receiving of emails safe for all users. “Let’s take a deeper look at the new defenses against malicious attachments. We now correlate spam signals with attachment and sender heuristics, to predict messages containing new and unseen malware variants. These protections enable Gmail to better protect our users from zero-day threats, ransomware and polymorphic malware,” the company said. Following several phishing attacks against Google Docs last month, Google upgraded Gmail for Android. The app was updated with a notification feature to warn you anytime you are about visiting any malicious website. The malicious emails were sent from contacts, asking people [Gmail account users] to open a Google Doc. Anyone who falls for this, is immediately asked to give authorizations to a fake Google Docs app. Granting such authorization, will give the sender [hacker] the permission to read, send, delete and manage email, as well as manage contacts. The new update took the security level of the app one step higher than it was—you will now be notified with a warning when trying to phishing site from your mail.

Register Advertise Follow Subscribe to Search Marketing Daily Google's New Focus On Ad Blocking Should Diversify Revenue Gains by Laurie Sullivan  @lauriesullivan, June 2, 2017 In a much anticipated move, Google plans to introduce an ad blocker to Chrome early in 2018. It will allow publishers to block AdSense ads they don't like on their site. The move should gain favor with advertisers and publishers that have been asking for more controls in Google's ad platform, as well as from consumers looking for a better online experience. Chrome will stop showing ads, including those owned or served by Google, on Web sites that are not compliant with the Better Ads Standards. Sridhar Ramaswamy, SVP of ads and commerce, confirmed in a blog post that Google wants to build a better Web for everyone by eliminating intrusive ads online without removing all ads. So the company joined the Coalition for Better Ads, an industry group dedicated to improving online ads, and stated several initiatives to help advertisers, consumers and publishers clean up online. advertisement advertisement The new ad experience begins with Funding Choices, a spinoff of Google Contributor that Google initially launched in 2014 and then shuttered as the company revamped the platform. The original service allowed Web site visitors to pay a monthly subscription fee to avoid seeing ads. Now in beta, Funding Choices enables publishers to serve a custom message to visitors using an ad blocker. The message would either invite the site visitor to either enable ads, or pay for a pass that removes all ads on that site through the new Google Contributor. Funding Choices initially rolls out to publishers in North America, the U.K., Germany, Australia, and New Zealand, and become available elsewhere later this year An Ad Experience Report for best practices, which Google published along with the tools, should assist publishers to understand how the Better Ads Standards apply to their own Web sites. The report highlights "annoying ad experiences" in screenshots and videos that Google identified to make it easy to find and fix the issues. The move not only puts Google in a favorable light with advertisers, consumers and publishers, but will diversify the way Google generates revenue. Today the majority of Google's revenue comes from advertising. As Mary Meeker points out on page 327 of Kleiner Perkin's latest trends report, Google began as a search engine in 1998. The co-founders later created a holding company to support other services such as cloud services, self-driving cars, artificial intelligence and hardware, and satellites. Overall, Google's sales now contribute 81% of the ad revenue from its online network, about $17.4 billion -- up from 71% a year ago. During the first quarter of 2017, total ad sales rose nearly 19% to $21.4 billion, according to company data. Google will take nearly 78% of the U.S. search ad revenue in 2017, according to the latest report from eMarketer. The biggest challenge, of course, will be for Google's parent company Alphabet to increase revenue from "Other Bets," which includes companies such as Nest, the self-driving cars unit, and the life sciences unit Verily. During the first quarter of 2017, "Other Bets" climbed 82% to $809 million. The downside is that the group has yet to find its footing. It had an operating loss of $3.6 billion in the final quarter of 2016. ad blocking, ad technology, google, search 1 comment about "Google's New Focus On Ad Blocking Should Diversify Revenue Gains".

Jeff Martin from IMF, June 2, 2017 at 7:31 p.m. So, Google (who controls the #1 advertising network) is going to create and control their own ad blocker (through a browser they control) designed to cripple (only competitor) "annoying ads." I will be very interested in what the FTC has to say.

Google confirms it will block bad ads in Chrome, starting in early 2018 Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/06/01 3:35pm PDTJun 1, 2017 83 Plus 1 on G+ 441 Share on Facebook 121 Share on Twitter Total Shares645 Applications Google News About two months ago, the Wall Street Journal reported that Google would add an ad-blocking feature into the Chrome web browser. Similar to AdBlock Plus' default setting, Chrome would block ads deemed unacceptable (such as pop-ups, auto-playing video ads, etc). Google has now confirmed this, and shared further details about how it will work. In a post on the company's blog, Google announced that it is joining the Coalition for Better Ads, an industry group attempting to improve online ads. The group has developed the Better Ads Standards, a list of guidelines for desktop and mobile ads based on comprehensive research. Ads deemed unacceptable include pop-ups, auto-playing video ads with sound, large sticky ads, and other common formats. In the post, Google confirmed that Chrome will soon not show ads, including those served by Google, on websites not in compliance with the Better Ads Standards. The change will take effect in "early 2018." This is huge news, especially considering that Google serves more online ads than any company on Earth. Now that Chrome has approximately 60% of the desktop browser market share (and growing), sites will likely have no choice than to follow the guidelines.

Can get rid of those annoying app install ads when browsing on the phone! Corbin Davenport Yeah, I think those are included, since they stick to the top while scrolling. Mgamerz Great news, but I guarantee you there's going to be a shitstorm headed their way really quick. Corbin Davenport Oh for sure. Something something free market. bekifft This is huge. However if they don't address the issue of deceptive ads, it's still a big problem. Hopefully one day I can finally in good conscience stop installing ad blockers as simply a security measure to protect my users. Corbin Davenport I haven't looked through all of the standard's documentation, but I don't see anything about deceptive ads. But I agree, that should be addressed. My1 not really android related but when these things like get 10000 euro in a month easily show up in SKYPE, an application by MICROSOFT that hurts, and they even have HTTPS ads with certificate errors Eli Stevens I get the job done from convenience of my place, with very simple projects that only needs only from you a Desktop computer system as well as web connection and I am happier than before...

Cat Astrophy Deceptive is extremely hard to deal with and far more subjective. "Bad" can be virus ridden, or employing technical methods that can be detected automatically (like pop ups). Gregory Will there be an option to block all ads without exceptions? Corbin Davenport Most likely not. Artem Russakovskii Sort of, but if you subscribe to sites running Funding Choices and use Contributor to buy an ad-free pass. Which is how it should be if you want to enjoy quality content from creators. Good ads and free if you don't. No ads and small fee if you do. Bimmer Ime or you can install an adblocker and enjoy no ads and no fee :) Tom Westrick And the sites you enjoy won't be able to sustain themselves... Nathan J Are they hurting now? Because that's what we have now. We have ad blockers, and we have ABP with its acceptable ads, but a lot of people turn it off. How about the sack on that guy, telling the main guy at AP to block ads on his own site? I'm a block-everything guy too, but I'm going to be seriously looking into this Funding Choices thing. I don't want my ad-free page views being wasted on just any old site, but sites I read daily, like AP and Neowin, I definitely want to see them get their cut. Cakefish ABP allows through Taboola, Outbrain and Revcontent. The polar opposite of acceptable ads. R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ That would kill the internet and you would have to pay for everything. Ads are what make the internet free Gregory You know, they can always make money on others, not on me. Most people don't bother blocking ads, they simply don't care. Mark Curtis Yeah gimme free entertainment, but YOU foot the bill! David The internet was in fact a much *worse* place before ads became a thing. All the nice stuff you have access to now only exists because of ad revenue (email, YouTube, any and all social networking platforms) Toys Samurai He reminds me of some people whom I know -- always say they hate ads and would rather pay for it. But when the content provider actually asks for money, they don't open up their wallets. Jorgen Phillips This is the most hippocritical thing I think I have ever read. Toys Samurai Exactly. This very site he's reading would not even exist if everyone blocks ads. David That's not true, they could just use a different monetization model. Nathan J Hypocritical. You may be thinking of the hippocratic oath, where the famous phrase "do no harm" comes from. If only ads would pledge to do no harm... abc You can pay for it and I'll coast for free. Ha ha, I'm a dick! Nathan J There already is. That's what we have now. I mean, we have the no ad blocker option, which is default. Then you have Adblock Plus's default setting, which whitelists ads ABP considers to be not malicious. And that's what Google is doing. Then you have ABP with that feature turned off, or something like uBlock Origin, that just blocks all the ads indiscriminately. This is a future measure that is designed to be more tolerant than current "all or nothing" solutions, plus Google is an advertising business. So, there probably won't be. Eddy Nelson Lopez They profit from it, why would they do it? 😂😂 Corbin Davenport They won't profit from it if a majority of users have an ad blocker. Which is where things are headed right now. exadeci They can blocks ads from everyone except theirs and having the most popular browser they can sell the exclusivity to other ad agencies. Corbin Davenport "In the post, Google confirmed that Chrome will soon not show ads, including those served by Google, on websites not in compliance with the Better Ads Standards." exadeci Couldn't they just prevent bad ads on their platform?! Imparus The problem is how you serve them to the user. If you create a popup filled with Google ads, it would be bad ads even thought they are Google approved ads. exadeci Right but if they can detect it in Chrome why can't they use this to disable the ads on the website that abuses it? Sonny Bono I'm guessing it's a preventative measure, seeing how many people get virused through some popup ads that they don't realize are a pathway to malicious software. We certainly don't want another epidemic of ransomware. I find most of my service calls go to elderly people who have no idea what they're doing and get tons of malware/ransomware. One old lady I was working with a few weeks ago actually "called microsoft" per the directions on her browser and gave them her credit card number. It wasn't really microsoft. abqnm As long as it takes care of the shady JavaScript click event pop-unders and other such js deceptive ad techniques which are generally not able to be caught by ad-blockers. I would really love to be able to go back to having JavaScript enabled and blacklist only certain sites rather than have to keep it disabled and whitelist the majority of my internet experience. TW Does this mean my phone won't connect constantly start vibrating because of ads on legitimate sites? raazman I'm sorry you have to experience this is this day and age. AintaDamnThingFunny This!! I've always wondered how those got through Chrome's security. I mean, it's an obtrusive add that makes your phone vibrate, and all you can do is close out the browser. How the hell do those get through and how has Google not stopped this from happening? Imparus Because a website can access the vibrator API, this is useful in the example of facebook, where you can activate notification for the site, and not having to use their shitty app. TW Now I know what to call the thing I hate: Vibrator API Total Insecurity For some reason female users like this API... BRO i prefer my phone silent, no notification sound or vibration, as i mostly use my pc with pushbullet mirroring My1 what the hell, how about they just pop a notif and let the phone do the rest? Imparus Okay so it was a bad example with facebook, since it is the notification API they are using not the vibration one, which means it follows the same rules as other applications. I should just have said a game might use it, but at the moment it is mainly used for BS ads. My1 okay, but I see no point in point in using the vibration on a website anyway. Imparus PWA, I mentioned game, since PWA is one of the new thing that is very likely to become huge in the next few years. Here you can try some few application made in it https://pwa.rocks/ so it is more that you should be ready for a paradigm change in what a website is, since the line between webapp and normal app will almost disappear. Example I use the QR scanner, so I don't have to have a dedicated app for it. My1 well honestly I think the PWA stuff is taking it too far, especially games, I mean dont they run better when compiled and optimized for an OS? also websites are supposed to work on any device that has a more or less modern browser and when games need for example multitouch, that thing is not really funny on a device without touch, since I cant summon a second mouse arrow. and when websites are starting to lose the point of working pretty much everywhere and becoming a gimmick it's starting to get stupid. especially if you have a bad internet connection these PWAs arent as great as when you just have your application. with the browser opening more and more, it's seriously going to risk opening itself to viruses and stuff Imparus I unfortunately don't have the time at the moment to explain all of these to you, so this will be quick rundown, and the rest you will have to research yourself if you are interested in it. "well honestly I think the PWA stuff is taking it too far, especially games, I mean dont they run better when compiled and optimized for an OS? " For most stuff it isn't a problem at all, as for game if they are simple enough optimization isn't as relevant. Most game would be written for an engine like unity or unreal, and one of the new thing in relation to PWA are modules, that will allow the use of engine like that, it also allow webapps to work completely offline. There will of course be some apps that are very heavy in computation on device that will make sense to run with native code that can run better, but there are being worked on optimizing things such as JS to make it run faster. "also websites are supposed to work on any device that has a more or less modern browser and when games need for example multitouch, that thing is not really funny on a device without touch, since I cant summon a second mouse arrow." You can have the browser serve different code depending on the device, that actually isn't anything new. "and when websites are starting to lose the point of working pretty much everywhere and becoming a gimmick it's starting to get stupid. " PWA actually allow apps to work everywhere, instead of just the OS you coded it to. Having one single code base would be great for pretty much every company. "especially if you have a bad internet connection these PWAs arent as great as when you just have your application." You can easily code for it to work offline, take the QR scanner on the side I linked you, I don't need internet to use it at all. Think of PWA like normal apps, if you use twitter then try using the PWA they have created. "with the browser opening more and more, it's seriously going to risk opening itself to viruses and stuff" Not really, this is one of the thing I will say you need to research yourself, since it will be quite a long explanation, I would start by looking into why chromeOS is more secure than Windows. I said there will be a huge grow with PWA over the next few years, since it is still very early in its development, only Firefox and Chrome support it at the moment and Edge will bring support in fall. AintaDamnThingFunny Right, but websites always ask me for permission if I want their notifications. Facebook using the vibrator API with your permission is one thing. Having an obtrusive add use it without your permission is another. Imparus That is because a website don't need to ask for permission, so it is more that Google should make it a permission check before allowing to use the vibration. Santos Chavez OMG I hate those types of ads! Especially when the ads that popup are so obstrusive I can't do anything but exit Chrome. Ugh! Rob Yeah, but some people love the vibrator API. hooch Holy shit I didn't even know this was a thing. Been using Firefox + uBlock Origin for a couple of years. blindexecutioner Doesn't affect me much. I already block ads. Nathan J It's not meant to affect you or I or anyone else who knows what uBlock Origin is. Google Chrome is the most popular browser, so I imagine what it will affect is the 60% or however many people use Chrome, and all of a sudden they're blocking malicious ads. That will affect a lot. I suspect for you and I, we will probably be able to just disable Google's solution and use our own, and if Google blocks other ad blockers, there's always Chromium. AS The biggest annoyances for me are subscribe popovers and EU cookie warnings. Things like taboola and outbrain need to be aggressively blocked. My1 cookie warning are annoying but it shows the scary relatity of all the sites that collect data with cookies. Lateef Alabi-Oki I'll disable my ad blocker if this gets rid of malicious and egregious ads. Nexus Hexus I'm sure most of these "Bad ads" will be alternative media. Or aka "Whatever we don't agree with" boop It's not content that's blocked, but format. Sonny Bono Ironically, all the ads that I find bothersome are on google services themselves, such as YouTube, but I have a Chrome extension (ublock origin) that works to get rid of them. Santos Chavez I enjoy YouTube so much, I pay for YouTube Red, via the Google Play Music Family Plan . Haven't seen an ad, especially on mobile. for months, and I get unlimited music streaming and downloading, all of those features shared to 5 other users. Pretty neat. Sonny Bono If they throw in free movies with the service I'd be down. I can already get anything I want on demand for no cost. I just appreciate watching random videos and I never know what I'm in the mood for. I'll just keep riding the links down the chain, bar tricks, gun porn, rocket engines, science experiments, old computers, animals and hunting videos... whatever it might be. ublock origin fixes the problem with ads - they don't exist any more - but not with popup windows on some questionable websites. abc Good for you. I use an adblocker and don't see any ads on Youtube. And I don't feel bad taking cents away from a multi-billion dollar corporation. I will never pay for streaming services because I like to own things. I could pay Netflix hundreds of dollars over the course of years, and the moment I disconnect, I am left with zero movies. I'd much rather grab some discs from the bargain bin. Gary But do they block those annoying as hell forced Google surveys? Adam Margeson Forced Google surveys? Where are you seeing those served up? And, are you sure they're legitimately from Google? Lord Argyris "...Google confirmed that Chrome will soon not show ads, including those served by Google, on websites not in compliance with the Better Ads Standards." I'm going to guess they're including their own ads here to avoid anticompetitive suits from competing ad providers. If they just blocked the other ads and left their own (presumably compliant ads), they would be gaining an unfair advantage and could be seen to be leveraging their strength in the browser market to incentivize use of their own ad platform. I wondered about this in my comment on the previous AP article on the subject, and it seems Google has considered the matter as well. Santos Chavez Yeah, it's kinda neat; by doing it that way Google avoids all sorts of blames of being hypocrites while also setting the example for everyone. "THIS", they say, "is how ads should be done. Look, we're even doing them to our own; you should, too". Terra Remove the ads that play before a video and we got a deal. Small banners below the video? Ok. Playing a commercial before the content I actually want to see? That is old tv bullcrap and is annoying as hell, even more so than popups. Dennis Ulijn "But, but, but... Terra: how would you solve this on Chromecast, etc.?" tigerberry Playing a commercial WHILE PLAYING THE DAMN VIDEO I'M ACTUALLY WATCHING? Whoever came up with that should be forced to never use an adblocker ever again. Cakefish Wonderful. Please also add extension support to Android Chrome (it's the number 1 feature that it's missing, desktop Chrome wouldn't have been as popular without it) but this is a good start. Ghirahim Install Opera and have a wonderful life. Jun rip pornhub ads Rod I wonder when they will fix the Notification Download Service bug in v58. https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=719641# Rob Thank goodness. Somehow, we went from doing away with auto-play videos and ads years ago, only to have them pop up a lot in recent months. I'm sick of them. BC Google is finally making a move that I truly approve of. Ads, especially the invasive ones have really taken over. I don't care about banner ads that I see just once or ads on the side. The ones that infuriate me the most are those that obscure content, automatically play loud sounds/videos. Those that try to trick the user into installing something they don't obviously need, need to die in a fire. It's why I've installed Ghostery and use Mercury Reader to banish that bullshit to the depths of the internet hell. I'm also pleased that Google is being smart about this and blocking all invasive content...Even if it comes directly from their company because they need to be impartial and control these insanely bad adverts. Forcing a standard will hopefully make the internet a cleaner place, one that can support the advert model without being deliberately invasive or deceptive. Dragos Lucian The only thing that makes me use an adblocker on a lot of websites, is because, more often than not, you don't even need to click on the ads to be presented with a buttload of new tabs or individual pages. You just need to click on a blank area and boom ! You can barely make your way back to the page you initially were. If those type of ads go away, then I'll make sure to uninstall my adblocker. Till then, fuck everyone who posts those type of ads on their websites in order to gain revenue. Make your money off selling socks. Abhishek Mittal Does this mean my phone wont start buzzing and downloading unwanted apps without my permission? This is huge, a great step by google in improving quality of the internet Spinkick Does it bother anyone that google is the one that decides which ads are bad? abc Google means that they are going to block their competitors ads and only allow their own.

Eric Schmidt, Jared Kushner -- (Twitter, screenshot) Don't miss stories. Follow Raw Story! Follow @rawstory The day after the executive chairman of Google’s parent company praised President Donald Trump’s embattled son-in-law, Jared Kushner, the White House announced that a Labor Department division investigating discrimination claims against government contractors was being shut down. According to Sarah Lacey – who connected the dots at Pando — Google will benefit from the closure since it was facing government scrutiny for underpaying women employed by the tech monolith. As noted, Google was fighting with the government over discrimination claims, arguing that compiling and maintaining the salary records was too  financially burdensome for the company with $28 billion in annual income. After complaining that Google would have to spend approximately $100,000 to do the paperwork required by the Labor Department, DoL attorney Ian Eliasoph took a shot at the response on Friday, stating: “Google would be able to absorb the cost as easy as a dry kitchen sponge could absorb a single drop of water.” That was then. In a piece that appeared on Sunday, May 28 in the New York Times, Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Alphabet, Google’s parent company, was one the few cited in the mostly critical examination of Kushner’s White House tenure to say something nice about the young real estate developer-turned Trumps right-hand man. Asked about Kushner’s reported work on business innovation for the White House, Schmidt stated: “His passion on this is very real.” As Lacy noted — while admitting that it might be a coincidence – the day after Schmidt’s comment was widely reported, the White House on Monday announced the shuttering of the very department looking at Google. “The Trump administration is planning to disband the Labor Department division that has policed discrimination among federal contractors for four decades, according to the White House’s newly proposed budget, part of wider efforts to rein in government programs that promote civil rights,” the Washington Post reported. As Lacey writes, “As luck would have it, three days after the DoL reminded Google that compliance with its anti-discrimination investigation was the price of being a government contractor, and just hours after Eric Schmidt issues his bizarre public defense of Jared Kushner, news broke that the Trump administration was planning to disband the organization doing the investigation.” Report typos and corrections to [email protected] About the AuthorTom Boggioni is based in the quaint seaside community of Pacific Beach in less quaint San Diego.

Name: Subject: Message: Google Home pre-orders begin in Canada for June 26 launch Canada Newsby John Callaham2 days ago 1 186 9 The Google Home connected speaker is now available to purchase in yet another country. Pre-orders are now being accepted on the Google Store site in Canada for the speaker, as well as other retailers such as Best Buy, for the price of $179 CDN. See also: Make your own Google Home commands with new shortcuts setting 3 weeks ago This is just the third country in the world where you can buy Google Home. It launched in the US in November, and earlier this year sales for the speaker began in the UK. Pre-orders for Google Home in Canada will begin shipping from the Google Store site in about two to three weeks, according to the listing. Officially, the launch is supposed to happen on June 26, where it will also be sold at Bell, Indigo, London Drugs, Rogers, Staples, The Source, Telus, Visions, and Walmart. If you buy the speaker from Best Buy, it will throw in a Chromecast dongle for free. In a blog post, the company also announced that its Google Assistant service, which works with the speaker, will also work in Canada for both English and French speaking residents. During Google I/O 2017 in May, the company announced that it will begin selling Google Home in more countries later this year, including Australia, France, Germany and Japan. It also announced plans to add a number of new features to the speaker in the coming months, including a way for owners to make outgoing hands-free voice calls. That feature will begin rolling out sometime in the next few months, but just for US owners. So far, the company has not announced just how many Google Home speakers it has sold.

Friday, June 2, 2017 [Tweets] [Favorites] Outsourcing Your Online Presence to Facebook Dave Winer: I don’t know what your privacy settings are. So if I point to your post, it’s possible a lot of people might not be able to read it, and thus will bring the grief to me, not you, because they have no idea who you are or what you wrote. It’s supporting their downgrading and killing the web. Your post sucks because it doesn’t contain links, styling, and you can’t enclose a podcast if you want. The more people post there, the more the web dies. John Gruber (Hacker News): You might think it’s hyperbole for Winer to say that Facebook is trying to kill the open web. But they are. I complain about Google AMP, but AMP is just a dangerous step toward a Google-owned walled garden — Facebook is designed from the ground up as an all-out attack on the open web. Marc Haynes’s Facebook post about Roger Moore is viewable by anyone, but: It is not accessible to search engines. Search for “Marc Haynes Roger Moore” on any major search engine — DuckDuckGo, Google, Bing — and you will get hundreds of results. The story went viral, deservedly. But not only is the top result not Haynes’s original post on Facebook, his post doesn’t show up anywhere in the results because Facebook forbids search engines from indexing Facebook posts. Joe Cieplinski: Look, I get that I’m the nut who doesn’t want to use Facebook. I’m not even saying don’t post your stuff to Facebook. But if Facebook is the only place you are posting something, know that you are shutting out people like me for no good reason. Go ahead and post to Facebook, but post it somewhere else, too. Especially if you’re running a business. The number of restaurants, bars, and other local establishments that, thanks to crappy web sites they can’t update, post their daily specials, hours, and important announcements only via Facebook is growing. That’s maddening. Want to know if we’re open this holiday weekend? Go to Facebook. Tossrock: I deactivated my Facebook account several months ago, and it’s been about 90% great, 10% frustrating. It’s great for all the obvious reasons (less timesuck, less compulsion to endlessly scroll your life away, no notification interruptions). The frustrations are real, though. Primarily it’s around events and photos. There are some communities I participate in that regularly organize events through Facebook, and now I don’t really get invited to those anymore. It’s also harder to organize events where you casually invite people you don’t know as well. Facebook Search Web Comments Stay up-to-date by subscribing to the Comments RSS Feed for this post.

[Update: Site is live, more details] Google launches Funding Choices, a way for users to pay sites to hide ads Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/06/01 8:01pm PDTJun 1, 2017 54 Plus 1 on G+ 126 Share on Facebook 77 Share on Twitter Total Shares257 Games News Update 1: 2017/06/01 8:01pm PDT The new site for Google Contributor/Funding Choices is live, and offers some new insight into how the service actually works. According to the signup page, each page without ads You may recall Google Contributor, which was a service by Google that allowed users to pay a monthly contribution to see fewer ads online. Your money would directly substitute the money earned by the site for advertisements. Contributor was discontinued in late 2016, with Google saying that an improved version would become available in "early 2017." Today, the company launched Funding Choices, the successor to Contributor. Currently in beta, it allows sites to show a customized message to visitors using an ad blocker. The message asks users to either enable ads for the site, or pay for a pass through Contributor that removes all ads on that site. Unlike the original Contributor, Funding Choices hides more than just AdSense ads If you're reading this and thinking, "I really wish Android Police would do this," then you're in luck. We've been part of Google's internal beta, but we're not quite ready to roll it out. Just know that we are definitely working on it. The new Contributor site doesn't seem to be live yet, but there will likely be more details there soon. Source: Google Update 1: 2017/06/01 8:01pm PDT The new site for Google Contributor/Funding Choices is live, and offers some new insight into how the service actually works. According to the signup page, each page without ads that you view on a site costs a small amount, with publishers apparently able to change the price (most of them seem to use $0.01 per page right now). So assuming $0.01 per page, $1 gets you 100 pages without ads, and Google is offering a $5 pass to start out with. Not bad pricing at all, as long as sites stay around the $0.01 price point. Google also offers a list of sites supporting Google Contributor, which currently includes Beliefnet, Business Insider UK, ComicBook, Eurogamer, Grub Street, Hot Air, Parkers, Patheos, Popular Mechanics, Townhall, Twitchy, and World Wide Gaming.

NexusPhan The ads in AP are not bad. Very reasonable and not intrusive at all. I have this site whitelisted to help support their great work. You should consider it too before funding choices goes live. MJ There is certainly websites with much more obnoxious ads but their is a lot of ads on AP. It's just not an acceptable user experience and I not going to subject myself to it. I have been calling for a way to donate to AP for awhile now (why did AP have to wait for a Google solution?) so we see how this plays out. Zachary Dunn Ecommerce is hard. Most small outlets like AP prefer a platform that can handle the security and financial liability. MJ I am not talking about ecommerce but making donations. LOL Alex Dueppen Unfortunately Disqus hasn't been the same way, it seems to often load ads that redirect you to those scam "You are winner" pages that try to look like facebook. Adriannacsmith Google is paying 97$ per hour! Work for few hours & have longer with friends and family! !dy164c: On tuesday I got a great new Land Rover Range Rover from having earned $8752 this last four weeks.. Its the most-financialy rewarding I've had.. Follow this link for more information !dy164c: ➽➽ ➽➽;➽➽ http://GoogleFinancialCashJobs454MarketDriveGetPaid$97/Hour... ★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫::::::!dy164c:....,..... Maxr1998 I hope these cancerous, unblockable Outbrain ads will also be a part of the funding choices, then I'll happily pay - not that I wouldn't contribute anyway, because I feel a bit guilty for blocking ads for a long time already.. Eli Stevens I do the job from comfort and ease of my residence, participating in effortless activities that just require from you a Laptop together with internet access and I am just pleased than ever... After 6 months in this job and therefore managed to get remunerated in whole 36,000 usd... Mainly I get approximately 80 bucks/h and work for 3 to 4 hours constantly.And magnificent factor with this job is the fact that you can supervise time when you do the job and for just how long as you wish for and you attain a check week by week.>>>> learn by clicking here how to do it right now needa I use adguard. No outbrain. Just an empty spot above the comments section with sponsored content in one corner and recommended by Outbrain in another. Maxr1998 Hm, interesting. I'm using adaway, maybe I need to tweak my filter lists a little then.. NeverrKnowsBest I have gotten full screen malware ads from AP before. I did not want to block them, but they forced my hand. NexusPhan They did have a bad streak of ads for a while about a year ago. I remember that now that you say it. I enabled ad blocker for a few months after it happened. Corbin Davenport I will say that those are normally from Disqus, and we've worked with Disqus in the past to identify them and get them removed. ZettabyteGamer I'm sure it would be hard but if disqus is causing so many problems, maybe you should switch to a different comment section or make your own? needa They would just have to throw more ads up themselves to pay for it. Disqus is pretty good anyways. Not to mention Disqus is a way to get new people to come back to your site. Meaning some guy that already has a disqus acct, but found the site because he needs a new phone, can instantly comment without having to sign up for another account at another site. needa I never thought about Disqus throwing in ads. Sort of makes me feel like an idiot for not seeing what is right in front of me. Now it all makes sense. Thanks. Marcelove Would you work to remove the Outbrain and Taboola cancer networks too? Keep any of those at AP makes any other changes useless... tnt How can you tell what is from Disqus vs the site? Justin W I'd agree that AP's ads aren't bad, but Disqus's are terrible. Irwin LOL are you seriuos? on mobile, like half the site is all ads. It's ridiculous. blueman24 I'm ok with whitelist for sites like AP on desktop but on mobile, I don't want any ads. AP can add 5 more ads on their desktop site but don't cripple performance on my already slow phone. Marcelove Never while it still use Taboola or Outbrain as ads delivers... Both are cancers and any site promoting them shall stay adblocked... No matter how much I like a site, or as good it is, if it decides to use those networks... Doing that equals being automatically added and never removed from my blacklist and everyone should do that to enforce it is unacceptable... tnt I'm with you 100%. They're pure trash. Add Revcontent in there as well. wow Why are they "cancers"? I mean, from what I see outbrain ads are trashy and slow but I don't understand why that's an automatic blacklist for a site that provides quality content for free. Do they have malware or something? (This is referring to those fake news ads above the comment section, right?) EcE APK Mirror - - I do not feel guilty and will happily wait my 10 seconds rather than see 200 ads per page and pop ups (or whatever they are called which are basically the same) whenever I need an APK. Rashad Would it be a one time cost or is this a cost each time we visit a participating site? Corbin Davenport I believe it's a monthly subscription, just like the previous Contributor. MJ Questions? Why did AP have to wait for a Google solution? There are many ways you could have been collecting money all this time. A automatic monthly subscription? Sounds like a loser already as people hate that. It's not going to be a set amount but like pick an amount right? An annual subscription would make more sense. Why can't there just be a simple donate button so people could send money when they can and just continuing blocking the ads ourselves like we have been already doing? Cai Copley It's that you do it in one, centralized location for such a subscription, and not doing it over a series of sites and forgetting how much you're spending. MJ I guess need more details on how it works... Jeff Beck We'll have a special rate for you MJ. .005 cents per article, $15 per grumpy comment submitted. We are going to make a fortune off you ;) Maxr1998 Starting the day with a smile thanks to your witty comments. Thanks Jeff! :D George https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4ba5750c423a92daff44db461bb3042c433e0f5e7edc1f8dadcb32198db0d5e8.jpg Artem Russakovskii It's almost here. Just finishing final testing. Mark Curtis Or just block ads and not pay! I'm entitled to free content! gimme gimme gimme. faceless128 it's about safety. there are so many malicious advertisements out there. if a site doesn't directly control the ads that show up, how can they ensure our safety? Camerooni I use privacy badger.. if it blocks ads that play bad - I'm okay with that alongside blocking tracking cookies etc. What I don't like is sites assuming that if you're blocking an ad network that plays bad with you that you're the bad guy.. Things have to work both ways. Mark Curtis AdBlocking started way back when they were simple JPGs with no JavaScript at all. It could even go back to that and people would complain about having to download the bytes. Ailín Ó’S I wonder will this work internationally or just USA only because I use adblock and don't have AP (for example) whitelisted because of the sheer volume of ads on the site especially from the likes of Disqus with their "Congrats! You're a winner!" and "Local man makes 999.999€ a day with this trick!" spam. cadtek91 I'd imagine it would work with anyone with a Google account? Fabrice Thomas Seems like it's only available in these contries: US, Germany, New Zealand and UK https://support.google.com/contributor/answer/6182581?hl=en Jeff Beck If you want to just pay me directly I'll give you my PayPal address. That'll make things even easier on you. I know, I'm way too nice to you all, you're welcome. DavidW dogecoins or gtfo TechGuy22 Thanks but I'll stick adblock and adaway needa If you guys are wanting input, which I know you didn't ask for, five bucks a year would be my max. Not sure how it works, but I would want that on my mobile device. Desktop chrome has what I need in an extension. Ultimately that would earn more money from me, as i get on this sight far less with mobile chrome. Good_Ole_Pinocchio 5 bucks a year? What does that Pay for? Beer for the staff? needa If everyone that comes to this site with adblock paid five bucks, I doubt they would complain. Jeffrey Spiers Brave browser has this built into the browser directly, have used the feature on some of my most frequented sites. Switched to Brave due to many sites detecting and bitching about ad blockers recently. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Web Ads are trash, always. But I've never used ad blockers. Because if I'm taking the content, I'm taking the ads, or I just don't go to the site if the ads are really horrible. I'd more than pay for no ads. psy spy You have to sign in to your gmail account for this to work? Easier to track us. _jack_ It would be nicer to have this from another company, yes. I also wonder, how much Google keeps for themselves? Godspoken Would there even be a difference between you being signed in to your Google account with this vs without? You're using Android and Google services, I don't know what you'd expect. abc I don't browse from my phone so I'm rarely signed into Google, and this will blow some people's minds on this site - but some of us only use two or three Google apps/services, not the whole damn suite. Lord Argyris The official blurb is a little vague. Each time I visit a page without ads, my pass/account/whatever has the site's chosen cost deducted from it. What constitutes a "page"? If I refresh the tab, does that count as an additional page load? What if I visit an article again at a later date? What about those obnoxious sites that have an automatic reload timer? Could they game FC users? I'm sure all these questions will be answered in time. What I would have liked to have seen is some sort of a multiple tier system, whereby I can select specific participants (e.g AP) and offer to pay a flat monthly rate rather than a per-page fee, then leave the normal fee structure in place for others. It would be an easy way to donate more than I would ordinarily accumulate to places I come frequently, without forcing said sites to set up their own donation system. No matter what tier FC visitors choose, the site gets money. FelschR It's stated quite clearly: "Note: you are charged each time you visit or refresh a page, even if you have previously visited it." https://support.google.com/contributor/answer/7359560?hl=en&ref_topic=6182570 Lord Argyris Okay, that answers that. The blurb on the page linked in the article lacked that more detailed information. Matías Duarte I've only used AdBlock for AP the moment that those ads magically opened a new popup while scrolling without even touching them. Now that the annoying problem is gone, I've disabled it. I know no one cares about this but I finally got accepted for a job and I'll get my very first payment tomorrow, so I would happily pay a contribution for this page! Jeff Beck I'll be one to care. Congrats! Getting paid is awesome. At least that's what the other writers at AP tell me. Kostas 💪🎩 😂😂😂😂😂😂 imneveral0ne I just had a you're a winner one pop up on my phone with android police, so it's definitely not gone. ZettabyteGamer How long till I can use this with you guys? I'm itching to try it out, but this is the only site I really read everyday. Necdet Ali Özdür I think the real question here is what Google means by "fewer ads". Are all kinds of ads will be blocked or just intrusive ones? Will the trackers also be removed? someone755 Hmmm... https://youtu.be/4ezd24krgiQ Powsniffer0110 I'd be happy to pay 1¢ an article on AP and Phandroid, XDA ect.! Powsniffer0110 This is funny as hell lol. We're now paying Google to NOT give us ads... Haha. YaKillaCJ Or continue using AdAway, uBlock Origins and DNS Host Blocking via my router. Many can say what they want but my stance is simple. I won't pay just to "not be inconvenienced and intrused on". Any dev, content providers or ect can easily find many non intrusive ways to advertise. Just_No_Stop This whole situation could have been avoided if ads weren't so intrusive, ugly, malicious, irrelevant and numerous. Some pages use less than a tenth of the data with ads blocked, which is crazy, and any ad that slows the delivery of content is unacceptable. It still baffles me how such appalling ads can be effective, if they piss you off why would you then want the product? Paying not to have to put up with such things is not on, I will keep blocking until sites have better ad policies. dancedar1 'Google offering a $5 pass' reads as though they are giving you $5 credit to try it out - they're not; it's £/$5 minimum mattcoz I also read it that way. 4Ui812 1 cent per page isn't a sustainable business model once users realize how much money they'll blow through. Sites that depend on advertising would be better served by using some sort of royalties model like the way radio stations do with music and artists/labels. Otherwise ad blockers are here to stay.Of course Google will want they're cut. 4Ui812 I'd be willing to turn off my ad blocker and sign up Google Contributor/Funding Choices for the free $5 and then I'd blow it all on this site so you guys and gals can have the money. Once it's gone though my ad blocker will be turned back on :-) Ad blocker is used for security reasons. tmartin Will it remove that Outbrain chum? I really need that stuff to go away. needa I use adguard and there is not one single avertisement on this page. There is a spot for outbrain, but no ads. tmartin I use Ghostery mostly because of the chum and that takes care of it, but I wouldn't mind supporting AP. needa I wouldn't mind either. I turn my blocker off periodically to help out. From the looks of it Google will have the answers we need soon enough with their new chrome filter that they are working on. Hopefully then we will be able to support our favorite sites without being slowed down by the ads. Marcelove Wall Street Journal will use it or it will keep that aggressive paywall? Because allowing only 10 articles is like grabbing the print version, take only one sheet and give to someone saying "If you wanna read more than 1 sheet per month, you need to pay us". I'm not against a publisher using a paywall, but the restriction here is so absurd that even if I was 100% determined to subscribe, I wouldn't only because at this example the newspaper is being douchebag... 30 articles, or 1 per day, would really mean that it was caring about itself and the public... But only 10 shows that it don't give a f*ck about the public and is only caring about itself... Anthony Castanza This is a substantial regression from the old version. Morten Ulv How did the old one work? rap 1¢ per page would add up very fast. By the time I read a couple of favorite blogs each day that would be $20 per month. jdrch $0.01 per page sounds doable. Lars Jeppesen Not available in my countries... Gen. Chang The point is to force the ad industry and websites to change the way they operate. Not reward them for more bad behavior. If it was not for the privacy intrusive models they use, there would not be as big a problem.

Roston - Jun 2, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit The new Wonder Woman movie is about to launch in theaters, and ahead of its release comes a new educational product from Google based on the movie. Released as part of its Made with Code initiative, Google has released a Wonder Woman-themed educational coding project that teaches kids (and adults!) the basics of coding using fun, interactive tools with instant results. Google has many versions of its coding projects; anyone who has used a past project will have a general idea of what to expect in the new Made with Code Wonder Woman project. Open the interactive environment here and you’ll be greeted with a picture under a grid, a character, and some actions. The goal is to choose the character and ‘code’ it to perform a specific action. In the first step, this action is running forward two blocks, jumping the distance of two blocks, then landing in a final block. The coding is achieved by piecing together blocks with pre-set actions, then clicking ‘Play’ to run the code. Users get to see the on-screen character react according to their code blocks. It’s all very intuitive, something a child could pick up easily and perform on their own. The Wonder Woman project has a total of three levels, the total duration of which is only a few minutes each. If you enjoy this project, you can find a bunch of others like it on the Made with Code Projects page, including others based on movies.

Gboard v6.3 enables search suggestions in the Google app and widget for some Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/06/01 9:32am PDTJun 1, 2017 39 Plus 1 on G+ 77 Share on Facebook 43 Share on Twitter Total Shares159 Applications News Google dropped a new version of Gboard last night, which includes a number of cool improvements to search. Some people are reporting another interesting feature in the form of Google search suggestions int he Google app and widget. Not everyone seems to have this, though. On older versions of Gboard, the keyboard's suggestion bar disappears when doing a search. That's still what it looks like for myself and most other AP staff after the update to v6.3. However, we've heard from a not insignificant number of people who are seeing the suggestion bar. This appears when searching via the Google widget and within the Google app. It seems to work just like the suggestion bar elsewhere. Start typing, and the keyboard guesses what word you might want to use next based on your typing history and the power of Google's prediction engine. Just grab the new version of Gboard and open a search to see if you've got it. Download QR-Code Gboard - the Google Keyboard Developer: Google Inc.

It has always been really annoying. Suicide_Note Deftones are a terrible band. Hurricane Andrew I still do not see it on my S7 Edge. I wonder if launcher choice makes a difference. I use Action Launcher. Would be interesting to know what launcher people who are and are not seeing this are using. Yuri Vidal on my s7 it works. are you a beta tester? i also dont use touchwiz launcher. the suggestion bar works for me on chrome, and on google app too. jkl888 I see the suggestions on my phone Artem Russakovskii I'm on the Pixel Launcher, tried both Google app 7.2 and 7.3, and Gboard 6.2 and 6.3, and I don't have this. Reply and post your launcher, Google App version, and Gboard version, and whether you have suggestions or not. Armando Rodriguez Have you notice that the "short" height is shorter than previous versions? abqnm Are you on an S8 or G6? They tweaked some proportions on the odd aspect ratio devices. The S8 doesn't have the hugely tall spacebar anymore, which may be why it seems that way. If you're not on one of those I'm not sure as it seems the same to me. Armando Rodriguez Nexus 5 DPI at 420 Raz Have it. Nova Beta, GBoard 6.3.15.157483061-arm64-v8a, Google app 7.3.19.21.arm64. The new GBoard just asked for access to my SMS to improve the suggestions.

João Ricardo He problaby has a theme kervation I am using a Google Pixel XL with the stock pixel launcher, running Google app version 7.3.19.21 & Google Gboard version 6.3.15.157483061. I have the suggestion bar for the Google app and also the Chrome beta browser and regular Chrome browser. I also have search suggestions show up when typing in the Google app. JATIN BANSAL I think this is also new. Earlier in dark themes, they used to have a white glow around emoji but now it is gone. I like it now https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/c8bcc901c9f60b97c05dc467df6fa4838f96cabcfbf6421714f5ec7189958205.png roberto.elena I wished the keyboard had a dynamic theme that would change automatically based on the app being used, like the status bar does: Youtube = red, WhatsApp = green, Facebook = blue, etc. thegrau There's a third party keyboard that does exactly that.

Lexster How are spaces after periods of sentences unnecessary? hype67 In acronyms, when the dot doesn't denote the end of a sentence. As decimals. Others situations I can't remember off the top of my head. Lexster USe acronyms with periods a lot, do you? I can't remember the last time I did. It's not generally required for acronyms. You put FBI, not F. B. I. But, yes, it's a little annoying with decimals, but that can generally be programmed to recognize if the space isn't needed. Swiftkey often does. It misses sometimes, sure, but usually works well. If a field needs an IP address, it usually knows this and doesn't put a space. And yes, it can be annoying with website names, but it's much easier to backspace every once in awhile than have to hit space after every single period or question mark. Łukasz Ordon Just press space twice :P It puts full stop AND a space after it... Lexster Yes, but I prefer having the space after punctuation. Doesn't require two taps of the space bar. And it only enters periods. Łukasz Ordon Oh well... You can't make everyone happy... Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Typing URLs and email addresses is a giant pain in SwiftKey. catalysto When it's the last sentence. Lexster Okay? Well, it doesn't add a space until you type a letter, so if it's the last sentence, there wouldn't be a space unless you typed something else. catalysto A period does not always signify the end of a sentence though. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman So glad it doesn't do that. One of the worst things in SwiftKey. Typing URLs and email addresses was such a giant pain in the ass. Hitting space after I type a period isn't a big deal to me AT ALL. Especially since I'm used to typing on a keyboard anyway, so do it automatically. Lexster There some reason it can't be an option? Or do you think because you don't want it that no one should? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman You didn't indicate an option. An option might be okay, although I think it might break enough things as to cause them problems overall. Sometimes options that break the experience are left out to prevent frustration when users forget they're responsible for their own problem. ozzyager I do see suggestions when doing a search. I also recieved the dog bone version first, before being updated again shortly thereafter. Maybe just a coincidence? catalysto Same thing happened to me. It's still working after updating to the non-beta version, too. Though I'm in the beta program for Gboard, so maybe that has something to do with it? My version number is 6.3.15.157483061-arm64-v8a, in case anyone is curious. Łukasz Ordon That Gboard app version with dog paw should not be released publicly. It indicates 'dogfood' version (as googlers call it) which should be tested only inside Google. Dogfood is just debug version of normal app (don't quote me on that tho) ozzyager Correct. This is why I wondered if there was any connection between that version being released by accident to some, like myself, and only some seeing the suggestions when doing a search. Of course it might just be a server side update that is being tested, etc. Łukasz Ordon I've myself got dogfood version but shortly after (like 5 mins later) I've received another update with normal apk... Armv7 version btw :p roberto.elena It also gives suggestions in Chrome while in incognito mode. abqnm While that may be unwanted, it should be pointed out that it now gives suggestions in the Chrome address bar. Period. Previously it did not suggest anything at all in the Chrome address bar, incognito or no. I still don't have it in search though. It does work when typing to Assistant, but it may have done that previously. boop Can someone explain the nav bar in the second pic? Łukasz Ordon It's probably Pixel phone navbar... destinyhud pixel phone if u mean the down arrow then when u click a bar the left become a down arrow boop The color, I mean destinyhud thats probably Gboard's feature. maybe with 6.3 Hurricane Andrew Running Action Launcher 3, Google app version 7.3.19.21, Gboard version 6.3.15.157483061 and do not have the suggestions in the search app. Łukasz Ordon Talking about Google app itself... apparently, cards in Google Now feed have new design now https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5fbd4b5888c4ad6d684f6ab3ba7589a3354607b05f565c0b7aed404237d8d8dc.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ed878edc7fa830f93bf49db1a7d5c8b4267ae6cada762eb9d0e723312cd72c5a.png Łukasz Ordon Aaaaand it's gone... Now cards are normal for me... Take look at football match card (I mean the 'title' of it) https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/150e49575e0870a2a9ca2cf19dd64acd4a3c720df42161667388f2bc104c7a1b.png Federico Rios Im still here with the 5.2.1 version before it called Gboard in Android O DP2 and im SO HAPPY :D whispy_snippet I've never understood why this feature hasn't always existed. Teja The word prediction is the only thing I worry about. Swiftkey is way better than Gboard which made me to switch back to Swiftkey. Michael Oghia Does anyone else experience problems with the spell check feature? Sometimes I misspell a word, it tells me it's misspelled, but then doesn't offer any suggestions. It used to work better a few years ago (when it was still just keyboard or whatever it was called). Vratislav Jindra I would swear I had this yesterday. Today it disappeared.

According to the Wall Street Journal, Google is giving publishers six months to prepare for the new tool, which will block ads on sites with “bad advertising experiences” and will reportedly be turned on by default in both the desktop and mobile versions of Chrome. While we’ve known about the Google ad blocker since April, this week marks the first time that Google has confirmed the move. Sridhar Ramaswamy, SVP of ads and commerce, explained in a blog post on Thursday that “we plan to have Chrome stop showing ads (including those owned or served by Google) on websites that are not compliant with the Better Ads Standards starting in early 2018.” Thankfully, before the ad blocker goes into effect, Google will give publishers the opportunity to use its new Ad Experience Report tool, which elucidates the differences between an acceptable experience and one that doesn’t conform to the Better Ads Standards. Once the publisher has determined which ads won’t fly under the new system, they can check this post for ads to use instead. This might sound troublesome for publishers who depend on ad revenue to keep their sites up and running, but considering the fact that 26% of US internet users already use third-party ad blockers, this could end up helping. Third-party ad blockers, like Adblock Plus, block each and every ad, regardless of how annoying or intrusive they are. Google’s ad blocker will only block ads when they don’t conform to the Better Ads Standards, which means that sites with tame ad experiences will be spared. Google is also introducing another tool called Funding Choices, which will allow publishers to “show a customized message to visitors using an ad blocker, inviting them to either enable ads on their site, or pay for a pass that removes all ads on that site through the new Google Contributor.” Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under ads ,  google ,  mobile advertising Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next New 'miracle' material could be the end of shattered iPhon...

However, Home was only available in the US at first. It came to the UK later, but America's neighbor to the north was left hanging. Not anymore—Google Home launches in Canada on June 26th. Home will understand both English (the kind with extra "ehs" and "sorrys," I guess) and Canadian French when it launches later this month. The feature set appears to be the same, so many smart home devices and services will work with Google Home out of the box. Pre-orders are live at the Google Store and Best Buy Canada. It looks like the price will be $179.99. It will be for sale at plenty of other retailers on launch day, including Indigo, London Drugs, Rogers, Staples, The Source, Telus, Visions, and Walmart.

Abhilash Bingi The hardware it packs is plenty for the next couple of years at least, and most of the updating is done on the cloud anyway. Look at the Amazon Echo, it launched 2 years before the Google Home, but still hasn't been upgraded. Unless you're interested in the rumoured Google Wifi + Home combo, there's no point in waiting IMO. Matt Horr-ahhh VAVAMk_2 Canada, ehy? That's what I'm talking aboot! Klatch I still don't really understand what it can do and how I'd justify buying it. I feel like that is a bit of a problem as an android and tech fan. George no problem bro, just don't buy it. I'm sure Google customer support thanks you for not giving them a headache too. YaKillaCJ It's really a convience. To really maximize it, getting AndroidTV, Chromecast Video/Audio, Smart/Automation Home products opens it up. The right setup and U rarely use your remotes or switches anymore. abc Don't buy it. Personally, I'm not even considering it until maybe 2020 when it comes out of beta. jonzey231 Damn, that's expensive. vn33 Canadian dollars .. work out to be the same price in $US jonzey231 Whoops lol. Didn't even do the conversion. Just by looking at it, it seemed like more than that. surethom I have Google home & echo, although the base is a bit low on the echo it's way better than the way over base of the Google home.

Computing Phones Cars Gaming Science Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Mobile Google Increases Maximum Android Bug Bounties to $200,000 Google Increases Maximum Android Bug Bounties to $200,000 By Ryan Whitwam on June 2, 2017 at 3:01 pm Comment Android has a reputation for poor security, but that’s a result of past failings. Most security flaws you hear about now affect old builds of the OS, or require clever social engineering to get the user to weaken device security. The versions of Android being released now are vastly more secure than what Google was putting out years ago. In fact, no one has managed to claim Google’s largest bug bounties for Android. So, the company is increasing the rewards to as much as $200,000. Google started the bug bounty program for Android about two years ago. It works just like other bug bounties the company has used for other products. Security researchers who can demonstrate an exploit get a cash prize, the amount of which varies based on the severity of the hack. Then, Google gets to fix the bug and avoid future security issues. Still, no one has submitted a working exploit for Android’s core components, even when such an exploit is worth $30,000-$50,000. So, by increasing the reward, Google hopes it will attract more researchers and engineers to the bug bounty program. The increases reward applies to two bounties; one for vulnerabilities in TrustZone or Verified Boot, and the other for a remote kernel exploit. Android is based on the Linux kernel, which has given the platform great flexibility over the years. However, the Linux kernel also comes with baggage. It has been the cause of several significant security breaches known as remote kernel exploits. An example of this would be the TowelRoot exploit, which could be used by users to gain root on a device. Of course, hackers could also use remote kernel exploits like that to infiltrate devices and steal data. The bounty for a new remote kernel exploit has gone up to $150,000 from $30,000. Verified Boot process. Google considers a flaw in TrustZone or Verified Boot to be an even more serious matter. TrustZone is actually an ARM technology related to the SoC inside your device. It ensures that biometric data (fingerprints), DRM, and boot settings are kept in a trusted secure environment. That’s all data you definitely don’t want exposed to hackers. Verified Boot was introduced in Android 4.4 KitKat as a way to make sure system software has not been tampered with each time a device starts up. Devices on Android 6.0 and higher actually alert the user to problems with Verified Boot. An exploit that can silently alter the system would be a big problem. Google has increased the bounty for both TrustZone and Verified Boot from $50,000 to $200,000. Google will probably increase the rewards yet again if this still doesn’t result in a valid report. Eventually it’ll be worth the time for someone to put in the necessary effort to uncover a new bug. After all, no software is perfect.

With iPhone sales slowing and the last new Apple product released two years ago, expectations are building for what the company will reveal next week at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference. Some Apple watchers are counting on artificial intelligence. With Facebook, Microsoft and Google emphasizing AI in their conferences over the past two months, market analysts believe it’s Apple’s turn. As the race for artificial intelligence heats up in Silicon Valley, some say Apple is already behind the game. “If Apple skips AI, I would consider that a significant miss on their opportunity,” said John Jackson, a Boston-based analyst for IDC. “Apple is late to this game. There is no other trick up their sleeve around this.” Apple, long known for its secrecy, declined to discuss specifics of the event but emailed a statement that its global developer community has earned more than $70 billion since the App Store launched in 2008. Rumors and early reports indicate the Cupertino, Calif., tech giant might release a new iPad pro, and according to Bloomberg, a Siri-controlled home speaker to challenge Amazon Echo and Google Home. Gene Munster, a venture capitalist at Loup Ventures and a longtime Apple watcher, said a home speaker would be a step in the right direction for Apple. “Artificial intelligence is fundamental to every company now,” Munster said. “We knew Apple was going to improve on Siri, and (the speaker) seems to line up. It makes logical sense.” In addition to the Siri speaker, rumors of a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro, a 12.9-inch iPad Pro 2, an updated MacBook Pro and a new iOS 11 have circulated on the internet. The five-day conference to be attended by more than 5,000 developers – who each paid $1,599 after winning a lottery – is moving from San Francisco to San Jose, where it will be held for the first time since 2002. Apple CEO Tim Cook will give the keynote speech Monday morning. His speech will be streamed live on Apple’s website, or through the WWDC iOS app. Some experts pushed back on the notion that Apple is behind in the AI race, saying Siri is not the only AI-driven technology built by Apple. But they acknowledged that companies like Amazon and Google have made smart AI-driven devices marketable – Google identifies itself as an AI first company – as Apple has mostly worked behind closed curtains. “For the average Joe on the street, AI for Amazon is Echo and Alexa,” said Carolina Milanesi, analyst at Creative Strategies. “Apple just chose not to label everything AI. Apple chose to let our experience with its devices speak for itself. But I think we are at a point where AI does matter in the advertising spiel.” In recent years, Apple has seen a decline in the sales of its main products, most noticeably the iPhone. Apple reported 50.8 million iPhones sold worldwide in the second quarter of 2017, down from 51.2 million a year earlier. Expectations are that Apple will unveil a new iPhone in the fall for the device’s 10th anniversary. Apple Watch, its latest product from 2015, saw its 2016 sales number double from the year before, according to Cook in the last earnings call. Apple does not release Apple Watch sales numbers, but some analysts have estimated about 12 million of the devices were sold last year.

Educational Technology June 2, 2017 Chromebook takeover signals major shift in education…but not in the way you may think Filed under: Educational Technology — admin @ 12:42 am BY MERIS STANSBURY, eSchool News Google’s Chromebooks are now the most used devices in K-12 classrooms across the U.S.  The use of Google in the classroom is true Googlification, or modeling learning off of Google’s own employee skillset, in that the use of Google and Chromebooks in the classroom aims to turn today’s students into creative and collaborative problem-solvers that know how to intuitively harness online and in-hand technologies. “Google is helping to drive a philosophical change in public education—prioritizing training children in skills like teamwork and problem-solving while de-emphasizing the teaching of traditional academic knowledge, like math formulas,” writes the New York Times. http://www.eschoolnews.com/2017/05/17/google-shift-education/ Share on Facebook Comments Off No Comments No comments yet.

Can’t rest until you know which summer blockbuster your pals enjoyed most? If you love finding out your friends’ opinions, I have good news: you don’t have to go around asking them individually. Thanks to the power of social media polls, you can quiz your friends and get responses in real-time. Next time you have to know whether vanilla or chocolate is more popular, here’s how to collect the thoughts of those closest to you. Twitter Polls In 2015, Twitter rolled out native support for polls, and they couldn’t be simpler. Just create a new tweet on the web or mobile versions of Twitter, and click the small Poll icon at the bottom of the tweet draft. You’ll have the standard 140 characters to type out a question, and can add up to four choices for readers to respond with. Finally, you can select the amount of time the poll stays alive for. The default is one day, but you can run a poll for a few minutes or an entire week. Which of these @MakeUseOf sections is your favorite? — Ben Stegner (@stegnersaurus) May 30, 2017 Obviously, your Twitter poll will only reach your followers to start, so the amount of responses you get will depend on how large your following is 10 Twitter Tips Most Pros Don't Even Know 10 Twitter Tips Most Pros Don't Even Know Read More . As long as your Twitter account isn’t private, anyone can retweet the poll just like any other tweet. If you start a poll about a hot topic, it could quickly spread beyond your sphere. To share the poll with more people, you can also embed it like you would a normal tweet. Pasting the URL to the tweet or using the embed code will let you add it to your blog or share on other social networks. Users must be signed into Twitter to vote, however. New poll!

Twitter has finally launched a built-in option to conduct public polls. It's completely free and works on both mobile and desktop. Read More to improve yours. Straw Polls Don’t use Twitter? Or want to share your polls across more services? The ultra-simple site Straw Poll is for you. It doesn’t require any sign-up or authentication. Simply type a question for your social media poll, enter as many choices as you need, and you’ve got a link you can share with your friends anywhere. Once a user completes it, they can view the results or share it with their friends via social links. To prevent spam and duplicate answers, Straw Poll offers a few extra options. The drop-down box below the poll offers three choices for blocking duplication: IP Duplication Checking — Users can’t vote from the same IP address multiple times. This will prevent two people living in the same house from both voting. Browser Cookie Duplication Checking — Instead of checking the IP address, Straw Poll will check the user’s browser cookies to see if they’ve voted yet. This allows two people in the same house to each vote, but if someone cleared their cookies What Are Supercookies, and Why Are They Dangerous? What Are Supercookies, and Why Are They Dangerous?

If you select Allow multiple poll answers, users can check as many options as they want. This service doesn’t offer an option to end polls after a certain time. Overall, Straw Poll is the easiest way to create a quick social media poll that you can share anywhere. It doesn’t require your friends to sign up, works great on mobile, and collects the data you want in a simple form.

Google Forms If you’re running an official quiz for a class assignment or something similar, you might need more flexible options and actionable data than a Twitter poll or Straw Poll provides. That’s where Google Forms comes in. This tool in the free Google Docs suite lets you create polls with different types of questions, add multiple pages, and send all the data to a spreadsheet for analysis. Head to Google Forms to get started. Like other Google tools, you can start with a blank form and build your own or use a template for common events like an RSVP, t-shirt ordering, or contact info. Question forms include: Short answer — Let someone type a sentence or two, like their name or a brief thought on a topic. Multiple choice — Standard question with multiple answers, only one of which the user can select. You can also add an Other option here. Checkboxes — You provide multiple answers and the respondent can select as many as apply. Linear scale — Set a numbered scale and ask the user to rate how often they do something or how strongly they feel on a question. Forms Options To add some flow to your poll, you can add images and YouTube videos using the right sidebar. You could ask how a particular image makes someone feel, or if they laughed at a YouTube video, for instance. Dividing your poll into sections will break it into multiple pages, and you can send users to these sections based on their answers. For instance, if you’re creating a poll to see which iPhone apps people use most often, your first page could simply ask Do you own an iPhone? If the user said No, you can specify that choosing that answer sends them to the end of the poll. This lets you ask completely different sets of questions How to Use Google Forms to Create an Interactive Workflow How to Use Google Forms to Create an Interactive Workflow Google Forms is the office workflow interface you didn't know you needed. Use Google Forms to collect information and in the next step add details or trigger a process. Read More depending on how earlier ones are answered. If surprise is a key factor in your poll, you can even shuffle the question order. To make your form a true quiz, click the Settings gear in the upper-right corner, then select the Quizzes tab. This lets you assign point values to questions. Forms will automatically grade them and show the respondent their score. Once your poll is all set, click the Send button to get a shareable link or send via email. After some people have answered, switching to the Responses tab lets you see how they responded. This also neatly formats the data into graphs and charts for easy analysis. Forms will import the responses into a new Google Sheets spreadsheet, so you can use that data elsewhere if you like.

Just head on over to Facebook and make up a list of questions in your status. Try some questions like these to get started: What was my first concert?

Now, the company has confirmed this will be happening in early 2018, though the technology doesn’t work like most third-party blockers. The ads that Chrome will block, which includes those owned or served by Google, are those that violate the standards set by the Coalition for Better Ads, an industry group that counts the likes of Facebook and Google among its members. Ads that are deemed “beneath a threshold of consumer acceptability” include full-page interstitials with countdowns, flashing ads, and those that unexpectedly play sounds. If just one of the ads on a site doesn't follow the Coalition’s standards, Chrome will block all of them, not just the offending advert(s). Google is also rolling out the Ad Experience Report. The tool warns publishers of any ads on their site that violate the coalition’s standards, while also providing screenshots and videos showing what constitutes an annoying ad. Developers can resubmit their site for review once they address the issues. Additionally, Google is working on a tool called “Funding Choices,” which allows publishers to display a customizable message to visitors asking them to, for example, disable their third-party ad blockers or pay a subscription to go ad free. The number of people using ad blockers jumped 30 percent last year. Google says this “reduces the ability for publishers to continue creating free content and threatens the sustainability of the web ecosystem.” By introducing the ad-blocking tech to Chrome, Google hopes to wrestle control away from the likes of Adblock Plus, which charges fees for whitelisting ads from certain companies. Google itself is part of Adblock Plus developer Eyeo GmbH’s “Acceptable Ads” program.

EU ready to fine Google billions in shopping search antitrust case [Report] In one of three active cases, the company faces potential fines of up to $9B. Greg Sterling on June 2, 2017 at 10:12 am More After several months of silence, it appears that antitrust regulators in Europe are ready to fine Google for “abuse of market position” in shopping search — one of three active cases against the company. Reuters reported the news based on discussions with “two people familiar with the matter.” The article says the fine will likely be imposed by August and could amount to up to 10 percent of the company’s global revenues, which last year were roughly $90 billion. In other words, Google parent Alphabet faces exposure of $9 billion in this single matter. The fine has been anticipated for some time given Google’s inability to settle the case with EU regulators. The company has made several unsuccessful attempts — (e.g., “rival links“) — to settle with former European Commission competition czar Joaquín Almunia. Almunia’s successor, Margrethe Vestager, has taken a tougher line against Google. The EU’s formal “Statement of Objections” (antitrust charges) in the case focused on comparison shopping, but other areas of search would potentially be vulnerable to similar claims (e.g., local/maps). The following were some of the verbatim claims that appeared in the Statement of Objections: Google systematically positions and prominently displays its comparison shopping service in its general search results pages, irrespective of its merits. Google does not apply to its own comparison shopping service the system of penalties which it applies to other comparison shopping services on the basis of defined parameters, and which can lead to the lowering of the rank in which they appear in Google’s general search results pages. As a result of Google’s systematic favouring of its subsequent comparison shopping services “Google Product Search” and “Google Shopping”, both experienced higher rates of growth, to the detriment of rival comparison shopping services. Google has vigorously pushed back on the EU’s position, asserting that the evolution of its search results pages has been about improving quality and the user experience, which are beneficial to consumers: Google has always worked to improve its services, creating new ways to provide better answers and show more useful ads. We’ve taken seriously the concerns in the European Commission’s Statement of Objections (SO) that our innovations are anti-competitive. The response we filed today shows why we believe those allegations are incorrect, and why we believe that Google increases choice for European consumers and offers valuable opportunities for businesses of all sizes. Reuters is also reporting that the European Commission “will tell Google to stop its alleged anti-competitive practices.” That would presumably involve a change in how shopping search results are presented. It’s not clear specifically what that would mean. Google can appeal to the European Court of Justice should the penalties be imposed. The two other active antitrust cases focus on exclusivity provisions in Google AdWords agreements and Android-OEM contracts and carry similar potential exposure for Google.

Google officially stops using DMOZ for source of search results snippets With that, you no longer need to worry about using the NOODP directive to prevent Google from using your DMOZ description. Barry Schwartz on June 2, 2017 at 10:15 am More Google has announced it will no longer use the Open Directory Project (DMOZ) title and descriptions as one of their sources of the search results snippets. On March 17, DMOZ officially shut down, and since the web directory is no longer being actively maintained, Google decided to stop using the DMOZ titles and descriptions in the Google search results. Since 2006 or so, Google would sometimes use the DMOZ description as a snippet in the Google results when it felt that description was more useful than what was available from the meta description or the site’s content. Google wrote “[W]ith DMOZ now closed, we’ve stopped using its listings for snippeting, so it’s a lot more important that webmasters provide good meta descriptions, if adding more content to the page is not an option.” That means that you no longer need to have the NOODP directive on your pages. That directive told Google to opt out of using the DMOZ description; with Google saying they no longer will use it, that directive is not needed anymore. Google strongly recommends you read this document to help Google pick the best title and description for your search result snippet going forward.

Gilbert Baker Google doodle celebrates LGBT-rights activists & creator of the iconic rainbow flag In honor of Gay Pride Month, Google has adorned its LGBT-related search results with rainbow flag imagery. Amy Gesenhues on June 2, 2017 at 10:17 am More Today’s Google doodle celebrates Gilbert Baker on what would have been the LGBT-rights activist’s 66th birthday. In 1978, Baker assembled a group of 30 people at San Francisco’s Gay Community Center to hand-dye and sew together more than 1,000 yards of cotton to create a rainbow flag that would be used for protests and marches. For nearly 40 years now, Baker’s creation has evolved into a symbol of pride and freedom for the global LGBTQA+ community. Google says Baker wanted to create something beautiful. “The rainbow is so perfect because it really fits our diversity in terms of race, gender, ages, all of those things. Plus, it’s a natural flag — it’s from the sky,” said Baker about his choice to go with a rainbow as a symbol of the LGBT community. Today’s doodle was designed by LGBT doodler Nate Swinehart. Google reports Swinehart worked with team members who felt a personal connection to the project and wanted to “… capture that same community spirit Baker treasured.” From the Google Doodle Blog: Together, the team decided the tribute would consist of a stop-motion animation of actual fabric strips coming together to create the flag. They made a trip to local San Franciscan fabric shops and filmed the doodle in a tiny kitchen only a few blocks from the same spot where Baker and his friends constructed that first flag in 1978. The doodle leads to a search for “Gilbert Baker” and includes the usual sharing icon to post the image on social feeds or send via email. Here’s today’s animated Gilbert Baker doodle that’s featured on Google’s US home page and a handful of its international sites: Google also shared the following two early concepts for the animated image: In addition to today’s doodle, Google is also celebrating Gay Pride Month by including rainbow flag imagery on LGBT-related search results. As part of their writeup on Gilbert Baker and the doodle they created in his honor, Google spoke with Baker’s sister, Ardonna Cook. She said her family is proud of her brother’s legacy of activism and artistry: “Gilbert led a bold and inspiring life by bringing The Rainbow Flag to life and it is that legacy which should guide us in respecting and celebrating diversity.” About The Author Amy Gesenhues Amy Gesenhues is Third Door Media's General Assignment Reporter, covering the latest news and updates for Search Engine Land and Marketing Land.

The internet giant's announcement comes as hundreds of millions of users have already installed blockers on their computers and phones to combat ads that track them and make browsing websites difficult, such as pop-up ads. These blockers threaten web publishers that rely on digital ads for revenue. Starting next year, Google's version will allow ads as long as publishers follow guidelines that ban certain types that consumers really hate. They includes pop-up ads, huge ads that do not go away when a user scrolls down a page, and videos that start playing automatically with the sound on. Google said the feature will be turned on by default, and users can turn it off. It will work on the desktop and mobile versions of Chrome. Google said that even ads it sells and manages will be blocked on websites that do not get rid of annoying types of ads. The company is also starting a programme that would help publishers deal with users who have downloaded popular ad blockers. Some individual websites have come up with their own counter-measures. Forbes.com, for example, will not let users read stories without disabling an ad blocker or logging in with Facebook or Google accounts, so the site can track them. Google would work with websites to set up messages telling users to disable blockers for the site or pay for a version of it with no ads. It will take a 10% cut of those payments. Facebook is trying to make links from inside its universe less spammy for users. It says it is trying to cut down on posts and ads in the news feed that lead to pages with "little substantive content" and "disruptive, shocking or malicious ads".

[Update: Site is live, more details] Google launches Funding Choices, a way for users to pay sites to hide ads Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/06/01 8:01pm PDTJun 1, 2017 54 Plus 1 on G+ 126 Share on Facebook 77 Share on Twitter Total Shares257 Games News Update 1: 2017/06/01 8:01pm PDT The new site for Google Contributor/Funding Choices is live, and offers some new insight into how the service actually works. According to the signup page, each page without ads You may recall Google Contributor, which was a service by Google that allowed users to pay a monthly contribution to see fewer ads online. Your money would directly substitute the money earned by the site for advertisements. Contributor was discontinued in late 2016, with Google saying that an improved version would become available in "early 2017." Today, the company launched Funding Choices, the successor to Contributor. Currently in beta, it allows sites to show a customized message to visitors using an ad blocker. The message asks users to either enable ads for the site, or pay for a pass through Contributor that removes all ads on that site. Unlike the original Contributor, Funding Choices hides more than just AdSense ads If you're reading this and thinking, "I really wish Android Police would do this," then you're in luck. We've been part of Google's internal beta, but we're not quite ready to roll it out. Just know that we are definitely working on it. The new Contributor site doesn't seem to be live yet, but there will likely be more details there soon. Source: Google Update 1: 2017/06/01 8:01pm PDT The new site for Google Contributor/Funding Choices is live, and offers some new insight into how the service actually works. According to the signup page, each page without ads that you view on a site costs a small amount, with publishers apparently able to change the price (most of them seem to use $0.01 per page right now). So assuming $0.01 per page, $1 gets you 100 pages without ads, and Google is offering a $5 pass to start out with. Not bad pricing at all, as long as sites stay around the $0.01 price point. Google also offers a list of sites supporting Google Contributor, which currently includes Beliefnet, Business Insider UK, ComicBook, Eurogamer, Grub Street, Hot Air, Parkers, Patheos, Popular Mechanics, Townhall, Twitchy, and World Wide Gaming.

NexusPhan The ads in AP are not bad. Very reasonable and not intrusive at all. I have this site whitelisted to help support their great work. You should consider it too before funding choices goes live. MJ There is certainly websites with much more obnoxious ads but their is a lot of ads on AP. It's just not an acceptable user experience and I not going to subject myself to it. I have been calling for a way to donate to AP for awhile now (why did AP have to wait for a Google solution?) so we see how this plays out. Zachary Dunn Ecommerce is hard. Most small outlets like AP prefer a platform that can handle the security and financial liability. MJ I am not talking about ecommerce but making donations. LOL Alex Dueppen Unfortunately Disqus hasn't been the same way, it seems to often load ads that redirect you to those scam "You are winner" pages that try to look like facebook. Adriannacsmith Google is paying 97$ per hour! Work for few hours & have longer with friends and family! !dy164c: On tuesday I got a great new Land Rover Range Rover from having earned $8752 this last four weeks.. Its the most-financialy rewarding I've had.. Follow this link for more information !dy164c: ➽➽ ➽➽;➽➽ http://GoogleFinancialCashJobs454MarketDriveGetPaid$97/Hour... ★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫::::::!dy164c:....,..... Maxr1998 I hope these cancerous, unblockable Outbrain ads will also be a part of the funding choices, then I'll happily pay - not that I wouldn't contribute anyway, because I feel a bit guilty for blocking ads for a long time already.. Eli Stevens I do the job from comfort and ease of my residence, participating in effortless activities that just require from you a Laptop together with internet access and I am just pleased than ever... After 6 months in this job and therefore managed to get remunerated in whole 36,000 usd... Mainly I get approximately 80 bucks/h and work for 3 to 4 hours constantly.And magnificent factor with this job is the fact that you can supervise time when you do the job and for just how long as you wish for and you attain a check week by week.>>>> learn by clicking here how to do it right now needa I use adguard. No outbrain. Just an empty spot above the comments section with sponsored content in one corner and recommended by Outbrain in another. Maxr1998 Hm, interesting. I'm using adaway, maybe I need to tweak my filter lists a little then.. NeverrKnowsBest I have gotten full screen malware ads from AP before. I did not want to block them, but they forced my hand. NexusPhan They did have a bad streak of ads for a while about a year ago. I remember that now that you say it. I enabled ad blocker for a few months after it happened. Corbin Davenport I will say that those are normally from Disqus, and we've worked with Disqus in the past to identify them and get them removed. ZettabyteGamer I'm sure it would be hard but if disqus is causing so many problems, maybe you should switch to a different comment section or make your own? needa They would just have to throw more ads up themselves to pay for it. Disqus is pretty good anyways. Not to mention Disqus is a way to get new people to come back to your site. Meaning some guy that already has a disqus acct, but found the site because he needs a new phone, can instantly comment without having to sign up for another account at another site. needa I never thought about Disqus throwing in ads. Sort of makes me feel like an idiot for not seeing what is right in front of me. Now it all makes sense. Thanks. Marcelove Would you work to remove the Outbrain and Taboola cancer networks too? Keep any of those at AP makes any other changes useless... tnt How can you tell what is from Disqus vs the site? Justin W I'd agree that AP's ads aren't bad, but Disqus's are terrible. Irwin LOL are you seriuos? on mobile, like half the site is all ads. It's ridiculous. blueman24 I'm ok with whitelist for sites like AP on desktop but on mobile, I don't want any ads. AP can add 5 more ads on their desktop site but don't cripple performance on my already slow phone. Marcelove Never while it still use Taboola or Outbrain as ads delivers... Both are cancers and any site promoting them shall stay adblocked... No matter how much I like a site, or as good it is, if it decides to use those networks... Doing that equals being automatically added and never removed from my blacklist and everyone should do that to enforce it is unacceptable... tnt I'm with you 100%. They're pure trash. Add Revcontent in there as well. wow Why are they "cancers"? I mean, from what I see outbrain ads are trashy and slow but I don't understand why that's an automatic blacklist for a site that provides quality content for free. Do they have malware or something? (This is referring to those fake news ads above the comment section, right?) EcE APK Mirror - - I do not feel guilty and will happily wait my 10 seconds rather than see 200 ads per page and pop ups (or whatever they are called which are basically the same) whenever I need an APK. Rashad Would it be a one time cost or is this a cost each time we visit a participating site? Corbin Davenport I believe it's a monthly subscription, just like the previous Contributor. MJ Questions? Why did AP have to wait for a Google solution? There are many ways you could have been collecting money all this time. A automatic monthly subscription? Sounds like a loser already as people hate that. It's not going to be a set amount but like pick an amount right? An annual subscription would make more sense. Why can't there just be a simple donate button so people could send money when they can and just continuing blocking the ads ourselves like we have been already doing? Cai Copley It's that you do it in one, centralized location for such a subscription, and not doing it over a series of sites and forgetting how much you're spending. MJ I guess need more details on how it works... Jeff Beck We'll have a special rate for you MJ. .005 cents per article, $15 per grumpy comment submitted. We are going to make a fortune off you ;) Maxr1998 Starting the day with a smile thanks to your witty comments. Thanks Jeff! :D George https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4ba5750c423a92daff44db461bb3042c433e0f5e7edc1f8dadcb32198db0d5e8.jpg Artem Russakovskii It's almost here. Just finishing final testing. Mark Curtis Or just block ads and not pay! I'm entitled to free content! gimme gimme gimme. faceless128 it's about safety. there are so many malicious advertisements out there. if a site doesn't directly control the ads that show up, how can they ensure our safety? Camerooni I use privacy badger.. if it blocks ads that play bad - I'm okay with that alongside blocking tracking cookies etc. What I don't like is sites assuming that if you're blocking an ad network that plays bad with you that you're the bad guy.. Things have to work both ways. Mark Curtis AdBlocking started way back when they were simple JPGs with no JavaScript at all. It could even go back to that and people would complain about having to download the bytes. Ailín Ó’S I wonder will this work internationally or just USA only because I use adblock and don't have AP (for example) whitelisted because of the sheer volume of ads on the site especially from the likes of Disqus with their "Congrats! You're a winner!" and "Local man makes 999.999€ a day with this trick!" spam. cadtek91 I'd imagine it would work with anyone with a Google account? Fabrice Thomas Seems like it's only available in these contries: US, Germany, New Zealand and UK https://support.google.com/contributor/answer/6182581?hl=en Jeff Beck If you want to just pay me directly I'll give you my PayPal address. That'll make things even easier on you. I know, I'm way too nice to you all, you're welcome. DavidW dogecoins or gtfo TechGuy22 Thanks but I'll stick adblock and adaway needa If you guys are wanting input, which I know you didn't ask for, five bucks a year would be my max. Not sure how it works, but I would want that on my mobile device. Desktop chrome has what I need in an extension. Ultimately that would earn more money from me, as i get on this sight far less with mobile chrome. Good_Ole_Pinocchio 5 bucks a year? What does that Pay for? Beer for the staff? needa If everyone that comes to this site with adblock paid five bucks, I doubt they would complain. Jeffrey Spiers Brave browser has this built into the browser directly, have used the feature on some of my most frequented sites. Switched to Brave due to many sites detecting and bitching about ad blockers recently. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Web Ads are trash, always. But I've never used ad blockers. Because if I'm taking the content, I'm taking the ads, or I just don't go to the site if the ads are really horrible. I'd more than pay for no ads. psy spy You have to sign in to your gmail account for this to work? Easier to track us. _jack_ It would be nicer to have this from another company, yes. I also wonder, how much Google keeps for themselves? Godspoken Would there even be a difference between you being signed in to your Google account with this vs without? You're using Android and Google services, I don't know what you'd expect. abc I don't browse from my phone so I'm rarely signed into Google, and this will blow some people's minds on this site - but some of us only use two or three Google apps/services, not the whole damn suite. Lord Argyris The official blurb is a little vague. Each time I visit a page without ads, my pass/account/whatever has the site's chosen cost deducted from it. What constitutes a "page"? If I refresh the tab, does that count as an additional page load? What if I visit an article again at a later date? What about those obnoxious sites that have an automatic reload timer? Could they game FC users? I'm sure all these questions will be answered in time. What I would have liked to have seen is some sort of a multiple tier system, whereby I can select specific participants (e.g AP) and offer to pay a flat monthly rate rather than a per-page fee, then leave the normal fee structure in place for others. It would be an easy way to donate more than I would ordinarily accumulate to places I come frequently, without forcing said sites to set up their own donation system. No matter what tier FC visitors choose, the site gets money. FelschR It's stated quite clearly: "Note: you are charged each time you visit or refresh a page, even if you have previously visited it." https://support.google.com/contributor/answer/7359560?hl=en&ref_topic=6182570 Lord Argyris Okay, that answers that. The blurb on the page linked in the article lacked that more detailed information. Matías Duarte I've only used AdBlock for AP the moment that those ads magically opened a new popup while scrolling without even touching them. Now that the annoying problem is gone, I've disabled it. I know no one cares about this but I finally got accepted for a job and I'll get my very first payment tomorrow, so I would happily pay a contribution for this page! Jeff Beck I'll be one to care. Congrats! Getting paid is awesome. At least that's what the other writers at AP tell me. Kostas 💪🎩 😂😂😂😂😂😂 imneveral0ne I just had a you're a winner one pop up on my phone with android police, so it's definitely not gone. ZettabyteGamer How long till I can use this with you guys? I'm itching to try it out, but this is the only site I really read everyday. Necdet Ali Özdür I think the real question here is what Google means by "fewer ads". Are all kinds of ads will be blocked or just intrusive ones? Will the trackers also be removed? someone755 Hmmm... https://youtu.be/4ezd24krgiQ Powsniffer0110 I'd be happy to pay 1¢ an article on AP and Phandroid, XDA ect.! Powsniffer0110 This is funny as hell lol. We're now paying Google to NOT give us ads... Haha. YaKillaCJ Or continue using AdAway, uBlock Origins and DNS Host Blocking via my router. Many can say what they want but my stance is simple. I won't pay just to "not be inconvenienced and intrused on". Any dev, content providers or ect can easily find many non intrusive ways to advertise. Just_No_Stop This whole situation could have been avoided if ads weren't so intrusive, ugly, malicious, irrelevant and numerous. Some pages use less than a tenth of the data with ads blocked, which is crazy, and any ad that slows the delivery of content is unacceptable. It still baffles me how such appalling ads can be effective, if they piss you off why would you then want the product? Paying not to have to put up with such things is not on, I will keep blocking until sites have better ad policies. dancedar1 'Google offering a $5 pass' reads as though they are giving you $5 credit to try it out - they're not; it's £/$5 minimum mattcoz I also read it that way. 4Ui812 1 cent per page isn't a sustainable business model once users realize how much money they'll blow through. Sites that depend on advertising would be better served by using some sort of royalties model like the way radio stations do with music and artists/labels. Otherwise ad blockers are here to stay.Of course Google will want they're cut. 4Ui812 I'd be willing to turn off my ad blocker and sign up Google Contributor/Funding Choices for the free $5 and then I'd blow it all on this site so you guys and gals can have the money. Once it's gone though my ad blocker will be turned back on :-) Ad blocker is used for security reasons. tmartin Will it remove that Outbrain chum? I really need that stuff to go away. needa I use adguard and there is not one single avertisement on this page. There is a spot for outbrain, but no ads. tmartin I use Ghostery mostly because of the chum and that takes care of it, but I wouldn't mind supporting AP. needa I wouldn't mind either. I turn my blocker off periodically to help out. From the looks of it Google will have the answers we need soon enough with their new chrome filter that they are working on. Hopefully then we will be able to support our favorite sites without being slowed down by the ads. Marcelove Wall Street Journal will use it or it will keep that aggressive paywall? Because allowing only 10 articles is like grabbing the print version, take only one sheet and give to someone saying "If you wanna read more than 1 sheet per month, you need to pay us". I'm not against a publisher using a paywall, but the restriction here is so absurd that even if I was 100% determined to subscribe, I wouldn't only because at this example the newspaper is being douchebag... 30 articles, or 1 per day, would really mean that it was caring about itself and the public... But only 10 shows that it don't give a f*ck about the public and is only caring about itself... Anthony Castanza This is a substantial regression from the old version. Morten Ulv How did the old one work? rap 1¢ per page would add up very fast. By the time I read a couple of favorite blogs each day that would be $20 per month. jdrch $0.01 per page sounds doable. Lars Jeppesen Not available in my countries... Gen. Chang The point is to force the ad industry and websites to change the way they operate. Not reward them for more bad behavior. If it was not for the privacy intrusive models they use, there would not be as big a problem.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Apple All the news we expect from Apple's huge developers conference Daniel Howley Dan Howley June 2, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share Apple CEO Tim Cook will be on hand for the company’s Worldwide Developers Conference on June 5. (Photo: Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP) Apple’s (AAPL) massive Worldwide Developers Conference kicks off Monday, June 5 at 1 p.m. E.T., and we’re expecting a host of new announcements. These announcements will give us a view into what the company has been working on over the past year, as well as what we can expect with its upcoming iPhone 8. Apple is known for using WWDC to showcase its newest software updates. That means we’ll likely see the latest versions of the company’s iOS for the iPhone and iPad, as well as macOS for Mac desktops and laptops. Apple should also announce improvements to its watchOS and tvOS systems, and could even roll out its very own Siri speaker to compete with the likes of Amazon’s (AMZN) Echo and Google’s (GOOGL, GOOG) Home. iOS 11 Apple regularly debuts the latest version of its iOS operating system at WWDC, and this year’s event should be no different. Interestingly, while hardware leaks are the norm for Apple’s devices now, we hardly see as many software leaks hit the web. That means we don’t know very much about iOS 11 quite yet. So far, the big rumors point to major updates to Apple’s Siri voice assistant, which first landed on the iPhone in 2011. While Siri has seen a slew of updates since then, it still can’t quite match the power of Amazon’s Alexa or Google’s Assistant apps. Apple’s iOS 11 will bring updates to the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, and some hints as to what we might see in the iPhone 8. With iOS 11, Apple could change that by bringing Siri more in line with what modern voice assistants have to offer such as expanded voice capabilities and improved language understanding. According to The Verifier, Apple could also add group calling to its FaceTime app, which would bring it in line with Google’s Hangouts and Microsoft’s Skype offerings. Whatever updates we see for iOS 11, it’s important to keep on eye on even the smallest changes, as they could provide a hint of what the iPhone 8 has to offer. Siri speaker Outside of iOS 11, Apple’s biggest potential announcement at WWDC is the Siri speaker. There haven’t been any leaked images of the speaker, which would compete directly with Amazon’s Echo, Google’s Home and Microsoft’s (MSFT) upcoming Cortana-enabled offerings. MacRumors says that Apple device will likely include facial-recognition technology and run off of the company’s iOS operating system.Bloomberg reports that Apple has already begun manufacturing the speaker, which means it could go on sale in the relatively near future. It will be interesting to see if Apple is capable of producing a product as powerful as Amazon’s Echo, especially since the Echo allows you to purchase items directly through Amazon using only your voice. macOS The software behind Apple’s Mac laptops and desktops, macOS is also expected to see some improvements at WWD. Little is known about the next major update to macOS, though if Apple sticks to recent patterns, it will likely throw in more iOS compatibility features to ensure iPhone users and Mac users stay within Apple’s product ecosystem. watchOS and tvOS As with Apple’s macOS, it’s still not clear what updates are coming to watchOS and tvOS.As CNET notes, Apple could begin offering a glucose monitor for the Apple Watch that would help diabetics monitor their blood sugar levels.CNBC reported in March that Apple CEO Tim Cook was seen walking around the company’s campus with a device connected to his watch that monitored his glucose. MacBook updates and a new iPad These rumors are a bit of a stretch, as Apple doesn’t usually announce much hardware at WWDC: But the mill keeps pointing to the potential for updated MacBooks and a new iPad debuting at the big show. According to Bloomberg, Apple will roll out three new MacBooks including a new version of the super-slim MacBook with a more powerful Intel processor, an upgraded MacBook Air and MacBook Pro with a new CPU. Read More Apple’s insanely thin and light MacBook is rumored to be getting an update at WWDC. It sounds like these MacBooks will only get improved internals, so don’t expect them to sport any new designs. The new iPad, meanwhile, is said to sport a 10.5-inch display and offer stylus support.9to5Mac says the iPad will manage to pack its large screen into a body that’s not much larger than the current 9.7-inch iPad. We’ll be on the ground in San Jose, California, and in our New York offices covering the day’s events as they happen. And don’t forget to follow all of the news as it happens via our live blog.

Bing have now shown their cards with image within image search. Not to be outdone by Google, Microsoft have attached the benefits of machine learning to their image search results. When searching the net most prefer Google, but, this has definitely added a bookmark in mind when we are looking at images. This added functionality will give consumers more control in finding what they want from an image alone. For example, see an item on TV that someone is wearing and you know you could pull it off easily? Now all you need do is find a screenshot of the scene and search within the image highlighting the item you want to purchase. With a little luck the correct item should now be shown beneath the original image as a clickable link.  Obviously this will not work perfectly every time but it can only get better. This is the thing with machine learning. The more people use it the more it learns. Even though this is not Google, it still has a very ‘Project Tango’ feel to it, as in, the machine knows what it is looking at. We tested it today and made a number of different searches. The most successful search was for ‘flea market’ As you can see below we just switched the capture box to a different area to focus on each separate item: 2. We also searched for a Micra engine image. We then chose to capture the air intake in the hopes it would show up a picture of the part or something similar. Unfortunately Bing sees this as an assault rifle scope, so definitely room for improvement. It will definitely be interesting to see how this one specific image changes its search results over time. How to try this out:   Search for flea market and hit enter Making sure you have Images selected: 2. Select the image.  3. Click the magnifying glass icon. 4. Now adjust the box to your chosen item. The search results below the image will change as you move over each item. Have fun teaching Bing machines!

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Internet Image Source: Shutterstock Google, the world’s biggest online advertising company, will start blocking online ads next year Jacob Siegal @JacobSiegal June 2nd, 2017 at 12:03 PM Share Tweet In an effort to force publishers to rethink the way they deliver ads on their websites, Google will be introducing its own ad blocker in 2018. According to the Wall Street Journal, Google is giving publishers six months to prepare for the new tool, which will block ads on sites with “bad advertising experiences” and will reportedly be turned on by default in both the desktop and mobile versions of Chrome. Don't Miss: It’ll be a long time until the Amazon Echo and Echo Dot are priced this low again While we’ve known about the Google ad blocker since April, this week marks the first time that Google has confirmed the move. Sridhar Ramaswamy, SVP of ads and commerce, explained in a blog post on Thursday that “we plan to have Chrome stop showing ads (including those owned or served by Google) on websites that are not compliant with the Better Ads Standards starting in early 2018.” Thankfully, before the ad blocker goes into effect, Google will give publishers the opportunity to use its new Ad Experience Report tool, which elucidates the differences between an acceptable experience and one that doesn’t conform to the Better Ads Standards. Once the publisher has determined which ads won’t fly under the new system, they can check this post for ads to use instead. This might sound troublesome for publishers who depend on ad revenue to keep their sites up and running, but considering the fact that 26% of US internet users already use third-party ad blockers, this could end up helping. Third-party ad blockers, like Adblock Plus, block each and every ad, regardless of how annoying or intrusive they are. Google’s ad blocker will only block ads when they don’t conform to the Better Ads Standards, which means that sites with tame ad experiences will be spared. Google is also introducing another tool called Funding Choices, which will allow publishers to “show a customized message to visitors using an ad blocker, inviting them to either enable ads on their site, or pay for a pass that removes all ads on that site through the new Google Contributor.” Tags: chrome, google View Comments Trending 1 Tech People are going to pay $880 for this ‘Pirates of the Caribbean’ Galaxy S8, sadly 2 Tech Rumor claims Apple’s MacBook Air line is dead 3 Tech Foxconn insider drops avalanche of information about the iPhone 8, new MacBooks, Apple’s smart glasses and more 4 Tech New leak sheds light on Apple’s secretive ‘smart glasses’ project 5 Tech See how the HTC U11’s camera stacks up to every other flagship Picked For You Samsung’s about to launch a new version of the Galaxy S8 By Chris Smith 4 days ago The OnePlus 5’s signature feature might have just been confirmed By Chris Smith 2 days ago Fresh leak sheds new light on the iPhone 8’s display By Yoni Heisler 2 days ago Advertise About Contact Copyright 2017 BGR Media, LLC Powered by WordPress.com VIP | Privacy Policy | Your Privacy Rights | Terms Of Use ad

Gboard v6.3 enables search suggestions in the Google app and widget for some Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/06/01 9:32am PDTJun 1, 2017 39 Plus 1 on G+ 77 Share on Facebook 43 Share on Twitter Total Shares159 Applications News Google dropped a new version of Gboard last night, which includes a number of cool improvements to search. Some people are reporting another interesting feature in the form of Google search suggestions int he Google app and widget. Not everyone seems to have this, though. On older versions of Gboard, the keyboard's suggestion bar disappears when doing a search. That's still what it looks like for myself and most other AP staff after the update to v6.3. However, we've heard from a not insignificant number of people who are seeing the suggestion bar. This appears when searching via the Google widget and within the Google app. It seems to work just like the suggestion bar elsewhere. Start typing, and the keyboard guesses what word you might want to use next based on your typing history and the power of Google's prediction engine. Just grab the new version of Gboard and open a search to see if you've got it. Download QR-Code Gboard - the Google Keyboard Developer: Google Inc.

I think they accidentally pushed out the dogfood version. mike shwilly Somehow the suggestions/corrections bar doesn't even appear for me on menus like that. Anyone got a clue? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fcf5ae1af260f403d6fe67b4a16960601a0f678f624415845c966be49de6c152.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7db6affa5d2544f41d448de7188c46494be0ca138cb1088830fd557174531b65.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0729dbe9f8f2b6951428091c0dc20c66822aa0bd1fb3d8c8198fba4181bd896a.png Artem Russakovskii That's the mystery - I'm not seeing suggestions either, but many are. mike shwilly I think i had this problem since Nexus 5. It has always been really annoying. Suicide_Note Deftones are a terrible band. Hurricane Andrew I still do not see it on my S7 Edge. I wonder if launcher choice makes a difference. I use Action Launcher. Would be interesting to know what launcher people who are and are not seeing this are using. Yuri Vidal on my s7 it works. are you a beta tester? i also dont use touchwiz launcher. the suggestion bar works for me on chrome, and on google app too. jkl888 I see the suggestions on my phone Artem Russakovskii I'm on the Pixel Launcher, tried both Google app 7.2 and 7.3, and Gboard 6.2 and 6.3, and I don't have this. Reply and post your launcher, Google App version, and Gboard version, and whether you have suggestions or not. Armando Rodriguez Have you notice that the "short" height is shorter than previous versions? abqnm Are you on an S8 or G6? They tweaked some proportions on the odd aspect ratio devices. The S8 doesn't have the hugely tall spacebar anymore, which may be why it seems that way. If you're not on one of those I'm not sure as it seems the same to me. Armando Rodriguez Nexus 5 DPI at 420 Raz Have it. Nova Beta, GBoard 6.3.15.157483061-arm64-v8a, Google app 7.3.19.21.arm64. The new GBoard just asked for access to my SMS to improve the suggestions. Bruno Logerfo wait since when there's a dark theme for the google widget? João Ricardo He problaby has a theme kervation I am using a Google Pixel XL with the stock pixel launcher, running Google app version 7.3.19.21 & Google Gboard version 6.3.15.157483061. I have the suggestion bar for the Google app and also the Chrome beta browser and regular Chrome browser. I also have search suggestions show up when typing in the Google app. JATIN BANSAL I think this is also new. Earlier in dark themes, they used to have a white glow around emoji but now it is gone. I like it now https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/c8bcc901c9f60b97c05dc467df6fa4838f96cabcfbf6421714f5ec7189958205.png roberto.elena I wished the keyboard had a dynamic theme that would change automatically based on the app being used, like the status bar does: Youtube = red, WhatsApp = green, Facebook = blue, etc. thegrau There's a third party keyboard that does exactly that. Can't remember the name, but I believe it's based on AOSP Yuri Vidal chroma keyboard Łukasz Ordon There is also Xposed module that can do that...

EmirSc minium has this. thecoolkid Thank god! I hated the glow, not very material design... Lexster Okay, but...when will they put a freaking space after punctuation? It's not that difficult, but after using Swiftkey, I really can't get used to having to put a space after punctuation. catalysto I would NOT want that. Don't need my OCD flaring up with unnecessary spaces. Though, sure, it should probably be an option. Lexster How are spaces after periods of sentences unnecessary? hype67 In acronyms, when the dot doesn't denote the end of a sentence. As decimals. Others situations I can't remember off the top of my head. Lexster USe acronyms with periods a lot, do you? I can't remember the last time I did. It's not generally required for acronyms. You put FBI, not F. B. I. But, yes, it's a little annoying with decimals, but that can generally be programmed to recognize if the space isn't needed. Swiftkey often does. It misses sometimes, sure, but usually works well. If a field needs an IP address, it usually knows this and doesn't put a space. And yes, it can be annoying with website names, but it's much easier to backspace every once in awhile than have to hit space after every single period or question mark. Łukasz Ordon Just press space twice :P It puts full stop AND a space after it... Lexster Yes, but I prefer having the space after punctuation. Doesn't require two taps of the space bar. And it only enters periods. Łukasz Ordon Oh well... You can't make everyone happy... Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Typing URLs and email addresses is a giant pain in SwiftKey. catalysto When it's the last sentence. Lexster Okay? Well, it doesn't add a space until you type a letter, so if it's the last sentence, there wouldn't be a space unless you typed something else. catalysto A period does not always signify the end of a sentence though. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman So glad it doesn't do that. One of the worst things in SwiftKey. Typing URLs and email addresses was such a giant pain in the ass. Hitting space after I type a period isn't a big deal to me AT ALL. Especially since I'm used to typing on a keyboard anyway, so do it automatically. Lexster There some reason it can't be an option? Or do you think because you don't want it that no one should? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman You didn't indicate an option. An option might be okay, although I think it might break enough things as to cause them problems overall. Sometimes options that break the experience are left out to prevent frustration when users forget they're responsible for their own problem. ozzyager I do see suggestions when doing a search. I also recieved the dog bone version first, before being updated again shortly thereafter. Maybe just a coincidence? catalysto Same thing happened to me. It's still working after updating to the non-beta version, too. Though I'm in the beta program for Gboard, so maybe that has something to do with it? My version number is 6.3.15.157483061-arm64-v8a, in case anyone is curious. Łukasz Ordon That Gboard app version with dog paw should not be released publicly. It indicates 'dogfood' version (as googlers call it) which should be tested only inside Google. Dogfood is just debug version of normal app (don't quote me on that tho) ozzyager Correct. This is why I wondered if there was any connection between that version being released by accident to some, like myself, and only some seeing the suggestions when doing a search. Of course it might just be a server side update that is being tested, etc. Łukasz Ordon I've myself got dogfood version but shortly after (like 5 mins later) I've received another update with normal apk... Armv7 version btw :p roberto.elena It also gives suggestions in Chrome while in incognito mode. abqnm While that may be unwanted, it should be pointed out that it now gives suggestions in the Chrome address bar. Period. Previously it did not suggest anything at all in the Chrome address bar, incognito or no. I still don't have it in search though. It does work when typing to Assistant, but it may have done that previously. boop Can someone explain the nav bar in the second pic? Łukasz Ordon It's probably Pixel phone navbar... destinyhud pixel phone if u mean the down arrow then when u click a bar the left become a down arrow boop The color, I mean destinyhud thats probably Gboard's feature. maybe with 6.3 Hurricane Andrew Running Action Launcher 3, Google app version 7.3.19.21, Gboard version 6.3.15.157483061 and do not have the suggestions in the search app. Łukasz Ordon Talking about Google app itself... apparently, cards in Google Now feed have new design now https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5fbd4b5888c4ad6d684f6ab3ba7589a3354607b05f565c0b7aed404237d8d8dc.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ed878edc7fa830f93bf49db1a7d5c8b4267ae6cada762eb9d0e723312cd72c5a.png Łukasz Ordon Aaaaand it's gone... Now cards are normal for me... Take look at football match card (I mean the 'title' of it) https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/150e49575e0870a2a9ca2cf19dd64acd4a3c720df42161667388f2bc104c7a1b.png Federico Rios Im still here with the 5.2.1 version before it called Gboard in Android O DP2 and im SO HAPPY :D whispy_snippet I've never understood why this feature hasn't always existed. Teja The word prediction is the only thing I worry about. Swiftkey is way better than Gboard which made me to switch back to Swiftkey. Michael Oghia Does anyone else experience problems with the spell check feature? Sometimes I misspell a word, it tells me it's misspelled, but then doesn't offer any suggestions. It used to work better a few years ago (when it was still just keyboard or whatever it was called). Vratislav Jindra I would swear I had this yesterday. Today it disappeared.

Google Home is coming to Canada on June 26th, pre-orders available now via Google and Best Buy Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/06/02 9:11am PDTJun 2, 2017 25 Plus 1 on G+ 16 Share on Facebook 37 Share on Twitter Total Shares78 Google Google Home News Videos Google Assistant debuted last year in Allo, but it wasn't until Assistant arrived on the Pixel and Google Home that we really got to see what it could do. However, Home was only available in the US at first. It came to the UK later, but America's neighbor to the north was left hanging. Not anymore—Google Home launches in Canada on June 26th. Home will understand both English (the kind with extra "ehs" and "sorrys," I guess) and Canadian French when it launches later this month. The feature set appears to be the same, so many smart home devices and services will work with Google Home out of the box. Pre-orders are live at the Google Store and Best Buy Canada. It looks like the price will be $179.99. It will be for sale at plenty of other retailers on launch day, including Indigo, London Drugs, Rogers, Staples, The Source, Telus, Visions, and Walmart.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars DEV Opinion ProBeat: Google’s Chrome ad blocker initiative makes Apple, Microsoft, and Mozilla look incompetent Emil Protalinski@EPro June 2, 2017 10:30 AM Google yesterday confirmed that Chrome is getting a built-in ad blocker that will block all the ads on a site (including Google’s own ads) if just one ad doesn’t meet certain standards. That’s right: Google, the company that makes the majority of its money from advertising, is building an ad blocker. This alone is crazy. Google already has the world’s most popular browser and it’s plowing ahead building arguably the only feature that would really differentiate other browsers. I find it astounding that none of the other major browser makers managed to beat Google to the punch. There is still time for Apple, Microsoft, and Mozilla to act. Google’s solution isn’t coming to Chrome until “early 2018,” a timeframe that could easily slip. Delivering an ad blocker directly in Safari, Edge, or Firefox this year could help these browsers in their fight with Chrome. And yet, I don’t expect any of these companies to do anything but eventually follow in Google’s footsteps. Apple moves way too slowly with Safari updates. Some have even gone as far to call Safari the new IE. Still, Apple loves playing up the security and privacy features of its macOS and iOS devices, slamming Google at every opportunity. It makes plenty of sense for Safari to have some sort of built-in ad blocker that not only protects users but also hurts Google’s bottom line. I also don’t really expect Microsoft will do anything in time, despite the rumor of a native ad blocker in Edge back in March 2016. The company has certainly sped up its browser development compared to the IE days, but Edge is still only updated twice a year along with Windows 10. And the features in this year’s second release, the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update, have already been announced. Firefox Tracking Protection That leaves Mozilla, the only company I can feasibly see not only getting something ready in time, but making sure it’s superior to what Chrome will have. Firefox could indeed steal Chrome’s thunder with a native ad blocker. Like Google, Mozilla updates its browser every six weeks or so. The firm also likes to regularly point out it develops the only independent browser — meaning it’s not tied to a tech company that has priorities which often don’t align with the web. Furthermore, Firefox has already offered a feature called Tracking Protection since November 2015. Just like how Chrome’s ad blocker won’t block all ads (if a site doesn’t have any low-quality ads, they all get shown), Firefox’s Tracking Protection also lets certain ads through. With Tracking Protection turned on, Firefox blocks website elements (ads, analytics trackers, and social share buttons) that could track you while you’re surfing the web, meaning it’s similar to add-ons like Ghostery and Privacy Badger. The problem is that Mozilla only offers Tracking Protection in Firefox’s Private Browsing mode (akin to Chrome’s Incognito or Edge’s InPrivate). If Mozilla really wanted to one-up Google, it would bring Tracking Protection to the forefront of Firefox. In fact, Mozilla ran an experiment that enabled Tracking Protection outside of Private Browsing mode. While the company identified websites that didn’t function properly with the feature on, and identified domains which have been incorrectly classified as trackers, it ended the experiment and didn’t pull the trigger on bringing it to Firefox users. “Making Tracking Protection available in Firefox outside of Private Browsing is certainly under consideration,” a Mozilla spokesperson told me a few months ago. “However, there are some websites which do not function properly when trackers are blocked.” In other words, Mozilla is being a coward. Its reluctance and inaction have given Google the perfect opening to let Chrome further pound Firefox into the ground. The feature wouldn’t even have to be enabled by default; Firefox could simply inform users about Tracking Protection and let them easily turn it on or off. The last step would be proper marketing: Firefox takes your privacy so seriously that it blocks ads and trackers more thoroughly than the ad blocker only coming to Chrome next year. Unless Apple, Microsoft, or Mozilla act quickly, you can bet Chrome’s stranglehold on the browser market will tighten. ProBeat is a column in which Emil rants about whatever crosses him that week.

Now, Google is using your search data to reveal what words Americans are struggling to spell — just in time for National Spelling Bee week. Google shared America's most misspelled words on Twitter with a color map showing what residents of each state struggle with the most. Ironically, the map misspelled the word "ninety" with "nintey." The list is compiled based on the top searched "how to spell" words from January 1, 2017, to April 30, 2017, so it's an evolving and changing list. It is organized by how many letters are misspelled in each word. There are some interesting errors, like states who struggle to spell beautiful, liar, and twelve. Or Wisconsin, whose residents had issues spelling the name of their own state. Others are understandable, like Connecticut and West Virginia who searched the spelling for supercalifragilisticexpialidocious from Mary Poppins. (The real question is why?)

The actor, who is working with the Indian cine icon in short film "Dream Catcher", added that he decided not to watch his films to avoid getting nervous in front of him. "I did Google his name. I found out that he was a legend. I thought that I will watch his films but then I thought it will make to nervous knowing how good he is,a Jeffery told IANS on Friday here. Jeffery, who also stars in "Pirates of the Caribbean - Salazar's Revenge", will be seen as love interest of actress Pooja Priyanka. The actor says Pooja talked about Dharmendra a lot and that made it "obvious how much of a superstar he was". The 20-minute film, which was shot in Delhi and the next schedule is expected to be in Mumbai, narrates a love story and puts the focus on the role technology plays in a relationship. It was Jeffery's first visit to the country. The actor says he was amazed by the dedication of Indian cast and crew. Talking about his experience, the 28-year-old said: "It was an honour and privilege to shoot in such a beautiful country. It was such an extraordinary experience...I am so looking forward to come back again." The actor, who has seen films like "Slumdog Millionaire" and aceThe Lunchbox", added: "I think Bollywood is a lot faster...I was amazed by hard working cast and crew." "Dream Catcher" is an Indo-Australian project, being made in collaboration with Australia-based producers Rishi Raj Films and Kinopticon Productions. Being helmed by Santoshh Shivamm, aceDream Catcher" is written by Rahul B. Seth. Shivamm is excited about his debut film.

The company detailed that the ad-blocker will work as a quality filter to ensure that websites are more responsible while adding advertisements by ensuring that the ads are not annoying or intrusive to the users. According to a report by The Verge, the company is planning to clean up the internet as the number of websites that bombard users with annoying advertisements has increased significantly over the years. The company clarified that it will not block all the ads. Instead, it will only block the ads that are not following a fixed standard for the ads. The interesting thing to note here is that the company will also block the advertisements offered by Google itself that don’t meet the standard. The report confirms that the blocker will work on desktop as well as mobile. It is providing publishers with a tool so that they can check if their websites meet the standards or not. ‘Coalition for Better Ads’, a group that consists of Google, News Corp, The Washington Post and Facebook is responsible for determining what ads meet the standards. The thing to note here is that even though this is a good move on part of Google to ensure that web publishers are providing a good experience to users which will lead to decrease in the instances of mass-ad blocking. But, this will also give Google an incredible amount of power on what kind of advertisements are acceptable and available on the internet extending its dominance over the online advertising space.

Brussels, June 2:   EU antitrust regulators aim to slap a hefty fine on Alphabet unit Google over its shopping service before the summer break in August, two people familiar with the matter said, setting the stage for two other cases involving the US company. The European Commission’s decision will come after a seven-year investigation into the world’s most popular internet search engine triggered by scores of complaints from both US and European rivals. The EU competition authority accused Google in April 2015 of distorting internet search results to favour its shopping service, harming both rivals and consumers. The Commission and Google declined to comment. The US company has in the past rejected the charges, saying that regulators ignored competition from online retailers Amazon and eBay Inc. Fines for companies found guilty of breaching EU antitrust rules can reach 10 percent of their global turnover, which in Google’s case could be about $9 billion of its 2016 turnover. Apart from the fine, the Commission will tell Google to stop its alleged anti-competitive practices but it is not clear what measures it will order the company to adopt to ensure that rivals get equal treatment in internet shopping results. The regulator could set out general principles or specific instructions for Google to follow, said an observer. The Commission’s tough line is in sharp contrast with the US Federal Trade Commission which settled its own web search case with the company in 2013 by requiring Google to stop “scraping” reviews and other data from rival websites for its own products. Google made three unsuccessful attempts to settle the case with the previous European Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia in a bid to stave off a possible fine and a finding of wrongdoing. Almunia’s successor Margrethe Vestager, however, has shown no willingness to settle with Google. The company has also been charged with using its Android mobile operating system to squeeze out rivals and with blocking competitors in online search advertising related to its “AdSense for Search” platform. The platform allows Google to act as an intermediary for websites such as online retailers, telecoms operators or newspapers. The Commission has warned of massive fines in both cases.

Google Home will officially be coming to Canada on June 26 and is available for pre-order starting today from the Google Store and Best Buy Canada, according to a Google Canada announcement and blog post. The voice-activated smart speaker will be powered by Google Assistant and supports both English and French. From finding results on Google and managing everyday tasks, to turning up music and controlling compatible smart devices, Google Home has a wide range of uses – all you have to do is say “Okay Google”. Related Stories Google confirms Home’s Canadian release, expanded Assistant capabilities at I/O Published on: May 17th, 2017 Eric Emin Wood @ericewood The smart assistant can do just about anything a consumer can think of: it can check the weather, traffic, stock markets, sports scores, and the hours of local stores. With a simple voice command, Google Home can read out the latest news or play that song you have stuck in your head with “Hi-Fi” sound quality. It is integrated with Google Play Music, Spotify, and more. Want to order an Uber? Done. Ordering pizza? Done. Need to set an alarm for tomorrow morning, or start a timer for the chicken baking in the oven? Done. It even offers translation services. Google Home can also be integrated with smart devices in a home to do things like control lights or the thermostat. ITWC editor-in-chief Brian Jackson had a chance to review the device – you can watch the video below. It was launched in the US in November 2016, and in April for UK customers. In May, Google announced that its Assistant would support the Canadian French language, offering hope that it would be launched in the country shortly. On June 26, it will retail at the Google Store, Bell, Best Buy, Indigo, London Drugs, Rogers, Staples, The Source, Telus, Visions, and Walmart.

Google Home is coming to Canada on June 26th, pre-orders available now via Google and Best Buy Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/06/02 9:11am PDTJun 2, 2017 25 Plus 1 on G+ 16 Share on Facebook 37 Share on Twitter Total Shares78 Google Google Home News Videos Google Assistant debuted last year in Allo, but it wasn't until Assistant arrived on the Pixel and Google Home that we really got to see what it could do. However, Home was only available in the US at first. It came to the UK later, but America's neighbor to the north was left hanging. Not anymore—Google Home launches in Canada on June 26th. Home will understand both English (the kind with extra "ehs" and "sorrys," I guess) and Canadian French when it launches later this month. The feature set appears to be the same, so many smart home devices and services will work with Google Home out of the box. Pre-orders are live at the Google Store and Best Buy Canada. It looks like the price will be $179.99. It will be for sale at plenty of other retailers on launch day, including Indigo, London Drugs, Rogers, Staples, The Source, Telus, Visions, and Walmart.

G-Money41 I'm curious about the same thing - or whether it will be able to accommodate both French and English users at the same time.

DazPowerz Are there any rumours so far about the Google Home 2? I wouldn't want to buy in a system I know might get upgraded in the next few months... needa I wouldn't buy a system that you have to shout at anyways. Wait for 2 no matter what. George WHAT?!? Abhilash Bingi The hardware it packs is plenty for the next couple of years at least, and most of the updating is done on the cloud anyway. Look at the Amazon Echo, it launched 2 years before the Google Home, but still hasn't been upgraded. Unless you're interested in the rumoured Google Wifi + Home combo, there's no point in waiting IMO. Matt Horr-ahhh VAVAMk_2 Canada, ehy? That's what I'm talking aboot! Klatch I still don't really understand what it can do and how I'd justify buying it. I feel like that is a bit of a problem as an android and tech fan. George no problem bro, just don't buy it. I'm sure Google customer support thanks you for not giving them a headache too. YaKillaCJ It's really a convience. To really maximize it, getting AndroidTV, Chromecast Video/Audio, Smart/Automation Home products opens it up. The right setup and U rarely use your remotes or switches anymore. abc Don't buy it. Personally, I'm not even considering it until maybe 2020 when it comes out of beta. jonzey231 Damn, that's expensive. vn33 Canadian dollars .. work out to be the same price in $US jonzey231 Whoops lol.

[Update: Site is live, more details] Google launches Funding Choices, a way for users to pay sites to hide ads Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/06/01 8:01pm PDTJun 1, 2017 54 Plus 1 on G+ 126 Share on Facebook 77 Share on Twitter Total Shares257 Games News Update 1: 2017/06/01 8:01pm PDT The new site for Google Contributor/Funding Choices is live, and offers some new insight into how the service actually works. According to the signup page, each page without ads You may recall Google Contributor, which was a service by Google that allowed users to pay a monthly contribution to see fewer ads online. Your money would directly substitute the money earned by the site for advertisements. Contributor was discontinued in late 2016, with Google saying that an improved version would become available in "early 2017." Today, the company launched Funding Choices, the successor to Contributor. Currently in beta, it allows sites to show a customized message to visitors using an ad blocker. The message asks users to either enable ads for the site, or pay for a pass through Contributor that removes all ads on that site. Unlike the original Contributor, Funding Choices hides more than just AdSense ads If you're reading this and thinking, "I really wish Android Police would do this," then you're in luck. We've been part of Google's internal beta, but we're not quite ready to roll it out. Just know that we are definitely working on it. The new Contributor site doesn't seem to be live yet, but there will likely be more details there soon. Source: Google Update 1: 2017/06/01 8:01pm PDT The new site for Google Contributor/Funding Choices is live, and offers some new insight into how the service actually works. According to the signup page, each page without ads that you view on a site costs a small amount, with publishers apparently able to change the price (most of them seem to use $0.01 per page right now). So assuming $0.01 per page, $1 gets you 100 pages without ads, and Google is offering a $5 pass to start out with. Not bad pricing at all, as long as sites stay around the $0.01 price point. Google also offers a list of sites supporting Google Contributor, which currently includes Beliefnet, Business Insider UK, ComicBook, Eurogamer, Grub Street, Hot Air, Parkers, Patheos, Popular Mechanics, Townhall, Twitchy, and World Wide Gaming.

NexusPhan The ads in AP are not bad. Very reasonable and not intrusive at all. I have this site whitelisted to help support their great work. You should consider it too before funding choices goes live. MJ There is certainly websites with much more obnoxious ads but their is a lot of ads on AP. It's just not an acceptable user experience and I not going to subject myself to it. I have been calling for a way to donate to AP for awhile now (why did AP have to wait for a Google solution?) so we see how this plays out. Zachary Dunn Ecommerce is hard. Most small outlets like AP prefer a platform that can handle the security and financial liability. MJ I am not talking about ecommerce but making donations. LOL Alex Dueppen Unfortunately Disqus hasn't been the same way, it seems to often load ads that redirect you to those scam "You are winner" pages that try to look like facebook.

Maxr1998 I hope these cancerous, unblockable Outbrain ads will also be a part of the funding choices, then I'll happily pay - not that I wouldn't contribute anyway, because I feel a bit guilty for blocking ads for a long time already.. Eli Stevens I do the job from comfort and ease of my residence, participating in effortless activities that just require from you a Laptop together with internet access and I am just pleased than ever... After 6 months in this job and therefore managed to get remunerated in whole 36,000 usd... Mainly I get approximately 80 bucks/h and work for 3 to 4 hours constantly.And magnificent factor with this job is the fact that you can supervise time when you do the job and for just how long as you wish for and you attain a check week by week.>>>> learn by clicking here how to do it right now needa I use adguard. No outbrain. Just an empty spot above the comments section with sponsored content in one corner and recommended by Outbrain in another. Maxr1998 Hm, interesting. I'm using adaway, maybe I need to tweak my filter lists a little then.. NeverrKnowsBest I have gotten full screen malware ads from AP before. I did not want to block them, but they forced my hand. NexusPhan They did have a bad streak of ads for a while about a year ago. I remember that now that you say it. I enabled ad blocker for a few months after it happened. Corbin Davenport I will say that those are normally from Disqus, and we've worked with Disqus in the past to identify them and get them removed. ZettabyteGamer I'm sure it would be hard but if disqus is causing so many problems, maybe you should switch to a different comment section or make your own? needa They would just have to throw more ads up themselves to pay for it. Disqus is pretty good anyways. Not to mention Disqus is a way to get new people to come back to your site. Meaning some guy that already has a disqus acct, but found the site because he needs a new phone, can instantly comment without having to sign up for another account at another site. needa I never thought about Disqus throwing in ads. Sort of makes me feel like an idiot for not seeing what is right in front of me. Now it all makes sense. Thanks. Marcelove Would you work to remove the Outbrain and Taboola cancer networks too? Keep any of those at AP makes any other changes useless... tnt How can you tell what is from Disqus vs the site? Justin W I'd agree that AP's ads aren't bad, but Disqus's are terrible. Irwin LOL are you seriuos? on mobile, like half the site is all ads. It's ridiculous. blueman24 I'm ok with whitelist for sites like AP on desktop but on mobile, I don't want any ads. AP can add 5 more ads on their desktop site but don't cripple performance on my already slow phone. Marcelove Never while it still use Taboola or Outbrain as ads delivers... Both are cancers and any site promoting them shall stay adblocked... No matter how much I like a site, or as good it is, if it decides to use those networks... Doing that equals being automatically added and never removed from my blacklist and everyone should do that to enforce it is unacceptable... tnt I'm with you 100%. They're pure trash. Add Revcontent in there as well. wow Why are they "cancers"? I mean, from what I see outbrain ads are trashy and slow but I don't understand why that's an automatic blacklist for a site that provides quality content for free. Do they have malware or something? (This is referring to those fake news ads above the comment section, right?) EcE APK Mirror - - I do not feel guilty and will happily wait my 10 seconds rather than see 200 ads per page and pop ups (or whatever they are called which are basically the same) whenever I need an APK. Rashad Would it be a one time cost or is this a cost each time we visit a participating site? Corbin Davenport I believe it's a monthly subscription, just like the previous Contributor. MJ Questions? Why did AP have to wait for a Google solution? There are many ways you could have been collecting money all this time. A automatic monthly subscription? Sounds like a loser already as people hate that. It's not going to be a set amount but like pick an amount right? An annual subscription would make more sense. Why can't there just be a simple donate button so people could send money when they can and just continuing blocking the ads ourselves like we have been already doing? Cai Copley It's that you do it in one, centralized location for such a subscription, and not doing it over a series of sites and forgetting how much you're spending. MJ I guess need more details on how it works... Jeff Beck We'll have a special rate for you MJ. .005 cents per article, $15 per grumpy comment submitted. We are going to make a fortune off you ;) Maxr1998 Starting the day with a smile thanks to your witty comments. Thanks Jeff! :D George https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4ba5750c423a92daff44db461bb3042c433e0f5e7edc1f8dadcb32198db0d5e8.jpg Artem Russakovskii It's almost here. Just finishing final testing. Mark Curtis Or just block ads and not pay! I'm entitled to free content! gimme gimme gimme. faceless128 it's about safety. there are so many malicious advertisements out there. if a site doesn't directly control the ads that show up, how can they ensure our safety? Camerooni I use privacy badger.. if it blocks ads that play bad - I'm okay with that alongside blocking tracking cookies etc. What I don't like is sites assuming that if you're blocking an ad network that plays bad with you that you're the bad guy.. Things have to work both ways. Mark Curtis AdBlocking started way back when they were simple JPGs with no JavaScript at all. It could even go back to that and people would complain about having to download the bytes. Ailín Ó’S I wonder will this work internationally or just USA only because I use adblock and don't have AP (for example) whitelisted because of the sheer volume of ads on the site especially from the likes of Disqus with their "Congrats! You're a winner!" and "Local man makes 999.999€ a day with this trick!" spam. cadtek91 I'd imagine it would work with anyone with a Google account? Fabrice Thomas Seems like it's only available in these contries: US, Germany, New Zealand and UK https://support.google.com/contributor/answer/6182581?hl=en Jeff Beck If you want to just pay me directly I'll give you my PayPal address. That'll make things even easier on you. I know, I'm way too nice to you all, you're welcome. DavidW dogecoins or gtfo TechGuy22 Thanks but I'll stick adblock and adaway needa If you guys are wanting input, which I know you didn't ask for, five bucks a year would be my max. Not sure how it works, but I would want that on my mobile device. Desktop chrome has what I need in an extension. Ultimately that would earn more money from me, as i get on this sight far less with mobile chrome. Good_Ole_Pinocchio 5 bucks a year? What does that Pay for? Beer for the staff? needa If everyone that comes to this site with adblock paid five bucks, I doubt they would complain. Jeffrey Spiers Brave browser has this built into the browser directly, have used the feature on some of my most frequented sites. Switched to Brave due to many sites detecting and bitching about ad blockers recently. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Web Ads are trash, always. But I've never used ad blockers. Because if I'm taking the content, I'm taking the ads, or I just don't go to the site if the ads are really horrible. I'd more than pay for no ads. psy spy You have to sign in to your gmail account for this to work? Easier to track us. _jack_ It would be nicer to have this from another company, yes. I also wonder, how much Google keeps for themselves? Godspoken Would there even be a difference between you being signed in to your Google account with this vs without? You're using Android and Google services, I don't know what you'd expect. abc I don't browse from my phone so I'm rarely signed into Google, and this will blow some people's minds on this site - but some of us only use two or three Google apps/services, not the whole damn suite. Lord Argyris The official blurb is a little vague. Each time I visit a page without ads, my pass/account/whatever has the site's chosen cost deducted from it. What constitutes a "page"? If I refresh the tab, does that count as an additional page load? What if I visit an article again at a later date? What about those obnoxious sites that have an automatic reload timer? Could they game FC users? I'm sure all these questions will be answered in time. What I would have liked to have seen is some sort of a multiple tier system, whereby I can select specific participants (e.g AP) and offer to pay a flat monthly rate rather than a per-page fee, then leave the normal fee structure in place for others. It would be an easy way to donate more than I would ordinarily accumulate to places I come frequently, without forcing said sites to set up their own donation system. No matter what tier FC visitors choose, the site gets money. FelschR It's stated quite clearly: "Note: you are charged each time you visit or refresh a page, even if you have previously visited it." https://support.google.com/contributor/answer/7359560?hl=en&ref_topic=6182570 Lord Argyris Okay, that answers that. The blurb on the page linked in the article lacked that more detailed information. Matías Duarte I've only used AdBlock for AP the moment that those ads magically opened a new popup while scrolling without even touching them. Now that the annoying problem is gone, I've disabled it. I know no one cares about this but I finally got accepted for a job and I'll get my very first payment tomorrow, so I would happily pay a contribution for this page! Jeff Beck I'll be one to care. Congrats! Getting paid is awesome. At least that's what the other writers at AP tell me. Kostas 💪🎩 😂😂😂😂😂😂 imneveral0ne I just had a you're a winner one pop up on my phone with android police, so it's definitely not gone. ZettabyteGamer How long till I can use this with you guys? I'm itching to try it out, but this is the only site I really read everyday. Necdet Ali Özdür I think the real question here is what Google means by "fewer ads". Are all kinds of ads will be blocked or just intrusive ones? Will the trackers also be removed? someone755 Hmmm... https://youtu.be/4ezd24krgiQ Powsniffer0110 I'd be happy to pay 1¢ an article on AP and Phandroid, XDA ect.! Powsniffer0110 This is funny as hell lol. We're now paying Google to NOT give us ads... Haha. YaKillaCJ Or continue using AdAway, uBlock Origins and DNS Host Blocking via my router. Many can say what they want but my stance is simple. I won't pay just to "not be inconvenienced and intrused on". Any dev, content providers or ect can easily find many non intrusive ways to advertise. Just_No_Stop This whole situation could have been avoided if ads weren't so intrusive, ugly, malicious, irrelevant and numerous. Some pages use less than a tenth of the data with ads blocked, which is crazy, and any ad that slows the delivery of content is unacceptable. It still baffles me how such appalling ads can be effective, if they piss you off why would you then want the product? Paying not to have to put up with such things is not on, I will keep blocking until sites have better ad policies. dancedar1 'Google offering a $5 pass' reads as though they are giving you $5 credit to try it out - they're not; it's £/$5 minimum mattcoz I also read it that way. 4Ui812 1 cent per page isn't a sustainable business model once users realize how much money they'll blow through. Sites that depend on advertising would be better served by using some sort of royalties model like the way radio stations do with music and artists/labels. Otherwise ad blockers are here to stay.Of course Google will want they're cut. 4Ui812 I'd be willing to turn off my ad blocker and sign up Google Contributor/Funding Choices for the free $5 and then I'd blow it all on this site so you guys and gals can have the money. Once it's gone though my ad blocker will be turned back on :-) Ad blocker is used for security reasons. tmartin Will it remove that Outbrain chum? I really need that stuff to go away. needa I use adguard and there is not one single avertisement on this page. There is a spot for outbrain, but no ads. tmartin I use Ghostery mostly because of the chum and that takes care of it, but I wouldn't mind supporting AP. needa I wouldn't mind either. I turn my blocker off periodically to help out. From the looks of it Google will have the answers we need soon enough with their new chrome filter that they are working on. Hopefully then we will be able to support our favorite sites without being slowed down by the ads. Marcelove Wall Street Journal will use it or it will keep that aggressive paywall? Because allowing only 10 articles is like grabbing the print version, take only one sheet and give to someone saying "If you wanna read more than 1 sheet per month, you need to pay us". I'm not against a publisher using a paywall, but the restriction here is so absurd that even if I was 100% determined to subscribe, I wouldn't only because at this example the newspaper is being douchebag... 30 articles, or 1 per day, would really mean that it was caring about itself and the public... But only 10 shows that it don't give a f*ck about the public and is only caring about itself... Anthony Castanza This is a substantial regression from the old version. Morten Ulv How did the old one work? rap 1¢ per page would add up very fast. By the time I read a couple of favorite blogs each day that would be $20 per month. jdrch $0.01 per page sounds doable. Lars Jeppesen Not available in my countries... Gen. Chang The point is to force the ad industry and websites to change the way they operate. Not reward them for more bad behavior. If it was not for the privacy intrusive models they use, there would not be as big a problem.

But for the people who make the apps, AR isn’t quite as simple, particularly when the apps they’re building involve 3D or “volumetric” objects — stuff you can walk around and interact with through the screen of the phone. Which is why Apple should start making that process a whole lot easier — especially if it is planning to release AR glasses in the future, ones that will need some sort of “killer app” or group of apps to justify their existence. Other companies, like Facebook, have now taken steps to let developers build AR experiences into their in-app cameras. You might not normally think of Facebook and Apple as direct competitors, but by doing this, Facebook has essentially set the stage for what is going to become an AR platform war on the phone. And Google already has its own AR platform, Tango. Amid the iOS, macOS, and potential Siri speaker reveals at WWDC next week, Apple needs to give due attention to AR. Augmented reality refers to any kind of computer-generated image that appears on top of a view of the real world. For the sake of this argument, however, let’s focus on smartphones. There are 2D AR apps: ones that do a pretty basic job of slapping a flat, non-dynamic digital image over the stuff you’re seeing through your camera lens. Developers say this is the easiest kind of AR mobile app to build. True 3D AR apps on mobile require sophisticated engineering right now Then there are 3D AR apps, which usually require more advanced software development and image processing. Think: Snapchat’s filters like the digital flower crown hovering over your head as you move around in real time, or the virtual furniture you can examine and walk around in home-renovation app Houzz. These may seem like lightweight (or lighthearted) applications, but Snapchat’s lenses require a serious amount of engineering, and the Houzz 3D AR feature took months to build. Another home-renovation platform that offers 3D imaging, Modsy, does most of its image processing after you’ve taken smartphone photos, which can take anywhere from five minutes to several hours. Afterward, it sends the rendered 3D images back to you. There’s another way to experience “true 3D” AR apps on a smartphone, and it’s a combo hardware-and-software solution. Google’s augmented reality computing platform, Tango, runs on smartphones that have a specific set of camera, infrared, and depth sensors. But right now there’s exactly one Tango phone model on the market. And some of the Tango apps are slow and low resolution. Since we’re not expecting any sort of hardware update to the iPhone lineup for the next four months at least — no new cameras or depth sensors that would enable 3D AR — that means any Apple advancements around AR in the near term will come from the software side. Some have speculated that Apple could announce “ARkit,” a kind of framework that would integrate parts of the existing camera with new software in a way that would allow developers to gather more information from the camera. Given that Apple chief executive Tim Cook has spoken so enthusiastically about AR in recent months, saying it’s a “big idea, like the smartphone,” this kind of framework makes a lot of sense. Currently, Apple doesn’t offer a specific API for virtual reality or augmented reality. There’s something called SceneKit, a kind of 3D-rendering engine for games, but no API for real-time object tracking. One developer, who spoke on background because of a pending AR app launch, told me that the one thing he has been hoping for is the ability to “hook into” the iPhone’s camera sensors and directly access the hardware in a way that developers currently can’t. Plus, if Apple really does plan to introduce AR glasses at some point in the future (something that has been rumored, but not confirmed), it will need a healthy ecosystem of app developers who know how to make or have already embraced augmented reality apps. Releasing a suite of developer tools for AR on the phone will presumably make it easier to move those apps over to future AR hardware products Apple could make. If Apple does eventually launch AR glasses, it’s going to need killer apps to prove that they’re useful, not awkward The last major pair of AR glasses to hit the market was the ill-fated Google Glass. Google Glass was awkward, made people uncomfortable in public, and even spawned the term “Glassholes.” But all of that may have been forgiven had the actual experience of having contextual information put right in front of your eyes been awesome. In other words: AR glasses are going to need apps so good and so useful that they justify whatever social awkwardness wearing a computer on your face creates. Will Apple be able to get major app developers to build AR apps for glasses, if and when it gets into glasses? Of course. But there’s also the very real possibility that the breakout app or surprise app for AR glasses would come from a less-established developer, one who wouldn’t have the resources to invest in true 3D AR if it’s as technically complicated as it is now. Apple has had a long-standing tradition of waiting to jump into a market because of the premise that it will do it — whatever it may be — better. But the company shouldn’t wait any longer to show the world that it’s serious about AR as a platform.

Play Movies & TV v3.26 adds Picture-in-Picture support for Android O [APK Download] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/06/02 10:42am PDTJun 2, 2017 30 Plus 1 on G+ 34 Share on Facebook 38 Share on Twitter Total Shares102 Android O Applications Downloads News When Google first started releasing developer previews of new Android versions a few years ago, it was pretty rare to see any of the apps adopting new APIs until the new version was finalized. With Android O, there's a very visible change to that trend as many apps in Google's lineup have already taken features like Notification Channels to heart. Another brand new user-facing feature found support in the latest release of Play Movies & TV: Picture-in-Picture Mode. The picture above was taken with the Android Messages app in the background while A Stork's Journey plays in a PiP window driven by Play Movies & TV. This is the third notable Google app to add support for Picture-in-Picture, following the version of YouTube included with the first developer preview and Duo, which gained support early last month. If you're running either version of the Android O developer previews, Picture-in-Picture mode can still only be activated by a custom button added to the navigation bar through the System UI Tuner. It's a simple enough process, but it really shouldn't be necessary. During the Google I/O Keynote, it was said picture-in-picture mode would be activated by pressing the home button, but that behavior doesn't appear to work in either of the developer previews. Picture-in-Picture is definitely one of the more popular user-facing additions in Android O, so it's pretty great to see it's getting attention in the apps that can really make the most of it.

YouTube does this even on my KitKat device. Mohamed Fixaal It's not exactly the same as you can minimize the YouTube app and still have the video playing in a pop-up in Android O, whereas in KitKat, the pop-up only works while you're in the YouTube app. Mace Moneta Ah, got it. Thanks.

Ironically enough, playing a youtube video on chorme and pressing Home, will crash it. I don't know why they don't enable the proper PiP support for those apps. Cheers! boop It works with YouTube as well Lazyboy0172 do any standard video players support this? I tried MX player, VLC, and VLC beta all with no luck. It's a great feature, but what about those of us with local content? Kovychuk mobo player seems to do it Lazyboy0172 thanks! Not exactly the same because it's not using the API which I would prefer, but it does have the same effect when I press 'home', which is probably the most important part. icyhotmike Youtubes been doing this for a while on Marshmallow so this feature should get Android 6.x support as well. My guess is this was the test was for PiP on Android O. Does YouTube have PiP on Android O now? RMAN! It does. Artem Russakovskii It should but I was unable to use it on my Pixel C running O DP2. I think it's not enabled by default, at least not for all. Sruly J PiP is working on my Pixel. Except, I had to follow this guide to enable it. http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/03/22/add-permanent-leftright-cursor-buttons-nav-bar-android-o/ pfmiller WTF? What about PIP support on Android TV?

Thankfully, with a few easy tricks on Google’s platforms, your trip’s logistics can come together easily and travel with minimal stress Stress Free Travel: How to Prevent Mistakes and Minimize Anxiety Stress Free Travel: How to Prevent Mistakes and Minimize Anxiety Wouldn't it be nice if traveling could be a blissful affair? With a healthy dose of technology and a few tweaks to your traveling mindset you can banish all anxiety. Read More . If you’ve found yourself digging out scraps of paper trying to find the meeting place for a tour group, or desperately searching for a confirmation number hidden somewhere in your inbox at the last minute, trust me — there’s a better way to do things. Sure, sometimes Google’s omniscience verges on creepy. But when it comes to planning vacations, it’s actually pretty helpful. From services targeted at travelers (such as Google Flights) to creative uses for generic tools (like Google Docs), these tips and tricks may completely change how you plan your next trip. Why Google? There are some people who would prefer not to use Google due to privacy concerns How To Clear Your Data From Google & Attempt To Regain Some Of Your Privacy How To Clear Your Data From Google & Attempt To Regain Some Of Your Privacy Wiping all trace of you from the web is not easy, but after reading Dragnet Nation by Julia Angwin you might just want to try. It's time to stop willingly throwing away your privacy. Read More . For many others, Google’s ease of use is worth the privacy trade-offs. Google’s services are ideal for trip planning because they are accessible from any device with a connection to the internet. This is ideal because: Multiple people can travel together and access the same apps and information via Google while using different operating systems. Google’s cloud-based nature allows you to access all your trip information if your main travel device is lost or stolen. It’s easy to share and integrate information between Google apps. Google’s services are free, so you don’t have to add anything into your budget. All the programs are generally easy to use — important for when you travel with people who aren’t as technologically savvy as yourself! There are a lot of other great online travel resources 5 Cool Travel Tools to Get a Truly Local Experience 5 Cool Travel Tools to Get a Truly Local Experience True travelers know that a local's knowledge is the real thing. With the right travel tool, find a local person wherever you are going, and check out their city through their eyes. Read More and apps designed specifically for travel out there. If you have concerns, feel free to use those instead — Google will never know. But if you’re someone who is okay with embracing Google as your overlord for a few weeks give the following strategies a try. After all, you travel plan could start with something as basic as a Google Search on the destination. Plan Using Google Docs One of the biggest benefits to keeping the plans for your trip on Google Docs is that you can access your detailed plans from anywhere with an internet connection. Worried about a lack of internet where you’re going? You can save and edit offline copies from any device with the Google Docs app! Tips to Try Create a master list of all the attractions you want to see, complete with links to their websites for up-to-date hours and prices. Use Google Docs to make a detailed itinerary that can be shared via a single link with everyone you are travelling with and loved ones at home. Google Docs is incredible for collaboration. Add the people you are travelling with as collaborators to your planning doc. This allows them to add their own information and ideas to the doc. You can then use comments to discuss the specifics of each idea, or assign tasks to specific users. Stay on Budget Using Google Sheets Using a spreadsheet to budget your vacation is hardly revolutionary. But it’s hard to beat the benefits of having your spreadsheet at your fingertips — both in the planning stages and while on vacation. Tips to Try Keep your spreadsheet active while you’re on vacation! This can be a great way to watch your running costs and prevent overspending. In group travel, add everyone to a shared spreadsheet to ensure that expenses are split evenly. Book Using Google Flights Google Flights is an incredible tool 9 Google Flights Tips That Can Change How You Travel 9 Google Flights Tips That Can Change How You Travel Google Flights helps you make the right choice for the best travel experience. Just like any of Google's search tools, there are tips to use Google Flights well and pitfalls to avoid. Read More . This site allows you to search for flights by destination, date, or price, and then provides you with flight prices from most major airlines in an easy-to-navigate format. Unlike many deals sites, Google Flights collects the best fares online and then directs you to the airline’s native checkout process, which helps to protect you when a flight is delayed or cancelled. Tips to Try Nothing beats the “Explore” map for daydreaming. Simply enter your dates and your potential departure airports, and then explore flight prices all over the world. Still have time before you need to finalize your plans? Google Flights lets you track your flight prices for a few days to see if you can get a better deal. You can even opt-in to e-mail notifications letting you know every time there’s a change in price. You can enter up to five nearby departure and arrival airports, and Google Flights will search all these combinations for the best deals possible. Google Flights will also recommend changing your travel dates within three days if there is a better deal out there. Find Things to Do Using Google Reviews This part of trip planning has long been dominated by other online travel gurus like TripAdvisor and Yelp, but there’s a lot to be said for Google’s tool as well. Tips to Try You can access Google Reviews for hotels, restaurants, and attractions through a simple Google search (e.g. “Things to do in Chicago”) or by searching on Google Maps while looking at a specific area. When searching for venues, Google Reviews often showcases upcoming events that may be of interest! Don’t just read the five-star reviews. The lower reviews can give you a lot of information about what NOT to do or eat! If you’re doing your research on a computer, use the “send to phone” feature for easy access to key locations on your phone. Google’s service acts as an intermediary to an attraction’s own websites and social media accounts. Check out these links, as there’s no better place to get accurate and up-to-date information than directly from the source! Remember Every Detail Using Google Calendar It might feel wrong to schedule a vacation, but it can be a huge help. The beauty of using Google Calendar while traveling is in the additional details that you can add to each “appointment” (even if that appointment is just lazing on a beach). Tips to Try Try setting reminders throughout the planning process. This strategy lets you stay on top of important deadlines, payment plans, and bookings. Use your appointment reminders as sources of information. This will keep you from digging through your entire planning document for confirmation numbers. Simply add key information (like addresses, phone numbers, and important names) to each event you plan for your trip, or add key documents using the “add attachment” feature. When travelling with a group, add people to important entries that are time sensitive (such as flights, or key events). This ensures that everyone will know where to be without any nagging! Navigate Like a Local With Google Maps Nothing identifies a tourist faster than pulling out a paper map. At this point, using services like Google Maps is basically second nature to all of us, so why not use it when you’re travelling? Tips to Try Before your departure, use Google Street View to look at key landmarks you will use for navigation. Getting an idea of what the hotel or restaurant looks like or how to walk from your hotel to public transit helps make new cities feel familiar. (Try this: Look inside international airports and shopping malls Preview International Airports And Train Stations Before You Travel On Google Street View Preview International Airports And Train Stations Before You Travel On Google Street View Google Maps will now let you preview global transit locations, including 16 international airports, and over 50 train and subway stations using Google Street View. Your travel planning just got easier. Read More on Google Street View before you travel.) If you won’t have a data connection where you are travelling, download a local map as an “offline area”! When using an offline map, you can still see your GPS location and receive driving directions. For walking directions, save some of your key locations before your trip to avoid looking like an obvious tourist with a paper map. Check everything on Google Maps Be Your Own Travel Guide: 7 Tips To Travel Smarter With Google Maps Be Your Own Travel Guide: 7 Tips To Travel Smarter With Google Maps Going on a trip can be such a stressful experience. But, let's walk you through the ways you can use Google Maps to plan every aspect of your next big trip. Read More before you leave. How long does it take to walk between tourist attractions at a certain time of day? How long will your drive be from the airport at rush hour? Is there a good place to stop for breakfast on your way home? Having this information at the ready helps you to plan your days better. It’s a lot easier to add a spontaneous adventure without disrupting other plans if you can accurately anticipate the travel time! Put It All Together Using Google Trips Of course, there’s also a dedicated Google app for travelling How Google Trips Can Help You Have an Amazing Vacation How Google Trips Can Help You Have an Amazing Vacation If you are hobbled with travel anxiety, this single tool can help you cope. Google Trips is by far the most underrated among the bevy of travel apps. Read More . Google Trips pulls together all the pieces of the planning process into a single accessible location. There’s no need to go searching for your airplane tickets, your saved locations, or your saved maps. They’re all here waiting for you. Tips to Try One of the most helpful features on the app is the ability to “Plan Your Day” — linking together all the activities and directions you need into a single file. Take advantage of the ability to download everything to your phone for a fully offline experience. Share Your Memories Using Google Photos Google Photos may or may not be the ideal photo service for you 12 Amazing Google Photos Features You Didn't Know About 12 Amazing Google Photos Features You Didn't Know About Google Photos is a well-known service, but it holds many little tricks. Here are 12 great features of Photos you might have missed. Read More . But, the platform shines when it comes to photo sharing. Everyone on your trip can upload as many photos as they want (at a lower resolution) to a shared album. This service eliminates the need for everyone to awkwardly pass around a USB key or navigate an app with set storage limits. All your vacation photos from everyone’s phones can be uploaded to Google Photos throughout your trip, and everyone can select only the photos they want to save. Ready to Go? There’s no denying it: vacations are complicated to plan. You may have visions of all the fun activities you want to do, the photographs you want to take, or the streets you want to explore. But the process of translating your daydreams into airplane tickets, hotel bookings, tour schedules and budgets can be overwhelming. Hopefully these quick tips will make a huge difference when it comes to planning this year’s summer vacation. What are your favorite tips for planning vacations?

Google Home is coming to Canada on June 26th, pre-orders available now via Google and Best Buy Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/06/02 9:11am PDTJun 2, 2017 25 Plus 1 on G+ 16 Share on Facebook 37 Share on Twitter Total Shares78 Google Google Home News Videos Google Assistant debuted last year in Allo, but it wasn't until Assistant arrived on the Pixel and Google Home that we really got to see what it could do. However, Home was only available in the US at first. It came to the UK later, but America's neighbor to the north was left hanging. Not anymore—Google Home launches in Canada on June 26th. Home will understand both English (the kind with extra "ehs" and "sorrys," I guess) and Canadian French when it launches later this month. The feature set appears to be the same, so many smart home devices and services will work with Google Home out of the box. Pre-orders are live at the Google Store and Best Buy Canada. It looks like the price will be $179.99. It will be for sale at plenty of other retailers on launch day, including Indigo, London Drugs, Rogers, Staples, The Source, Telus, Visions, and Walmart.

Abhilash Bingi The hardware it packs is plenty for the next couple of years at least, and most of the updating is done on the cloud anyway. Look at the Amazon Echo, it launched 2 years before the Google Home, but still hasn't been upgraded. Unless you're interested in the rumoured Google Wifi + Home combo, there's no point in waiting IMO. Matt Horr-ahhh VAVAMk_2 Canada, ehy? That's what I'm talking aboot!

I'm sure Google customer support thanks you for not giving them a headache too. YaKillaCJ It's really a convience. To really maximize it, getting AndroidTV, Chromecast Video/Audio, Smart/Automation Home products opens it up. The right setup and U rarely use your remotes or switches anymore. abc Don't buy it. Personally, I'm not even considering it until maybe 2020 when it comes out of beta. jonzey231 Damn, that's expensive. vn33 Canadian dollars .. work out to be the same price in $US jonzey231 Whoops lol.

Google confirms it will block bad ads in Chrome, starting in early 2018 Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/06/01 3:35pm PDTJun 1, 2017 83 Plus 1 on G+ 441 Share on Facebook 121 Share on Twitter Total Shares645 Applications Google News About two months ago, the Wall Street Journal reported that Google would add an ad-blocking feature into the Chrome web browser. Similar to AdBlock Plus' default setting, Chrome would block ads deemed unacceptable (such as pop-ups, auto-playing video ads, etc). Google has now confirmed this, and shared further details about how it will work. In a post on the company's blog, Google announced that it is joining the Coalition for Better Ads, an industry group attempting to improve online ads. The group has developed the Better Ads Standards, a list of guidelines for desktop and mobile ads based on comprehensive research. Ads deemed unacceptable include pop-ups, auto-playing video ads with sound, large sticky ads, and other common formats. In the post, Google confirmed that Chrome will soon not show ads, including those served by Google, on websites not in compliance with the Better Ads Standards. The change will take effect in "early 2018." This is huge news, especially considering that Google serves more online ads than any company on Earth. Now that Chrome has approximately 60% of the desktop browser market share (and growing), sites will likely have no choice than to follow the guidelines.

Can get rid of those annoying app install ads when browsing on the phone! Corbin Davenport Yeah, I think those are included, since they stick to the top while scrolling. Mgamerz Great news, but I guarantee you there's going to be a shitstorm headed their way really quick. Corbin Davenport Oh for sure. Something something free market. bekifft This is huge. However if they don't address the issue of deceptive ads, it's still a big problem. Hopefully one day I can finally in good conscience stop installing ad blockers as simply a security measure to protect my users. Corbin Davenport I haven't looked through all of the standard's documentation, but I don't see anything about deceptive ads. But I agree, that should be addressed. My1 not really android related but when these things like get 10000 euro in a month easily show up in SKYPE, an application by MICROSOFT that hurts, and they even have HTTPS ads with certificate errors Eli Stevens I get the job done from convenience of my place, with very simple projects that only needs only from you a Desktop computer system as well as web connection and I am happier than before...

"Which giant 'Download Here' button is the right one?! Oh, of course, it's the tiny text link buried between three of them." Santos Chavez Ugh, I hate those sites with a passion. They're part of the reason i vehemently block ads. Take your stupid large fake green buttons outta here, filths :3 Adriannacsmith Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Cat Astrophy Deceptive is extremely hard to deal with and far more subjective. "Bad" can be virus ridden, or employing technical methods that can be detected automatically (like pop ups). Gregory Will there be an option to block all ads without exceptions? Corbin Davenport Most likely not. Artem Russakovskii Sort of, but if you subscribe to sites running Funding Choices and use Contributor to buy an ad-free pass. Which is how it should be if you want to enjoy quality content from creators. Good ads and free if you don't. No ads and small fee if you do. Bimmer Ime or you can install an adblocker and enjoy no ads and no fee :) Tom Westrick And the sites you enjoy won't be able to sustain themselves... Nathan J Are they hurting now? Because that's what we have now. We have ad blockers, and we have ABP with its acceptable ads, but a lot of people turn it off. How about the sack on that guy, telling the main guy at AP to block ads on his own site? I'm a block-everything guy too, but I'm going to be seriously looking into this Funding Choices thing. I don't want my ad-free page views being wasted on just any old site, but sites I read daily, like AP and Neowin, I definitely want to see them get their cut. Cakefish ABP allows through Taboola, Outbrain and Revcontent. The polar opposite of acceptable ads. R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ That would kill the internet and you would have to pay for everything. Ads are what make the internet free Gregory You know, they can always make money on others, not on me. Most people don't bother blocking ads, they simply don't care. Mark Curtis Yeah gimme free entertainment, but YOU foot the bill! David The internet was in fact a much *worse* place before ads became a thing. All the nice stuff you have access to now only exists because of ad revenue (email, YouTube, any and all social networking platforms) Toys Samurai He reminds me of some people whom I know -- always say they hate ads and would rather pay for it. But when the content provider actually asks for money, they don't open up their wallets. Jorgen Phillips This is the most hippocritical thing I think I have ever read. Toys Samurai Exactly. This very site he's reading would not even exist if everyone blocks ads. David That's not true, they could just use a different monetization model. Nathan J Hypocritical. You may be thinking of the hippocratic oath, where the famous phrase "do no harm" comes from. If only ads would pledge to do no harm... abc You can pay for it and I'll coast for free. Ha ha, I'm a dick! Nathan J There already is. That's what we have now. I mean, we have the no ad blocker option, which is default. Then you have Adblock Plus's default setting, which whitelists ads ABP considers to be not malicious. And that's what Google is doing. Then you have ABP with that feature turned off, or something like uBlock Origin, that just blocks all the ads indiscriminately. This is a future measure that is designed to be more tolerant than current "all or nothing" solutions, plus Google is an advertising business. So, there probably won't be. Eddy Nelson Lopez They profit from it, why would they do it? 😂😂 Corbin Davenport They won't profit from it if a majority of users have an ad blocker. Which is where things are headed right now. exadeci They can blocks ads from everyone except theirs and having the most popular browser they can sell the exclusivity to other ad agencies. Corbin Davenport "In the post, Google confirmed that Chrome will soon not show ads, including those served by Google, on websites not in compliance with the Better Ads Standards." exadeci Couldn't they just prevent bad ads on their platform?! Imparus The problem is how you serve them to the user. If you create a popup filled with Google ads, it would be bad ads even thought they are Google approved ads. exadeci Right but if they can detect it in Chrome why can't they use this to disable the ads on the website that abuses it? Sonny Bono I'm guessing it's a preventative measure, seeing how many people get virused through some popup ads that they don't realize are a pathway to malicious software. We certainly don't want another epidemic of ransomware. I find most of my service calls go to elderly people who have no idea what they're doing and get tons of malware/ransomware. One old lady I was working with a few weeks ago actually "called microsoft" per the directions on her browser and gave them her credit card number. It wasn't really microsoft. abqnm As long as it takes care of the shady JavaScript click event pop-unders and other such js deceptive ad techniques which are generally not able to be caught by ad-blockers. I would really love to be able to go back to having JavaScript enabled and blacklist only certain sites rather than have to keep it disabled and whitelist the majority of my internet experience. TW Does this mean my phone won't connect constantly start vibrating because of ads on legitimate sites? raazman I'm sorry you have to experience this is this day and age. AintaDamnThingFunny This!! I've always wondered how those got through Chrome's security. I mean, it's an obtrusive add that makes your phone vibrate, and all you can do is close out the browser. How the hell do those get through and how has Google not stopped this from happening? Imparus Because a website can access the vibrator API, this is useful in the example of facebook, where you can activate notification for the site, and not having to use their shitty app. TW Now I know what to call the thing I hate: Vibrator API Total Insecurity For some reason female users like this API... BRO i prefer my phone silent, no notification sound or vibration, as i mostly use my pc with pushbullet mirroring My1 what the hell, how about they just pop a notif and let the phone do the rest? Imparus Okay so it was a bad example with facebook, since it is the notification API they are using not the vibration one, which means it follows the same rules as other applications. I should just have said a game might use it, but at the moment it is mainly used for BS ads. My1 okay, but I see no point in point in using the vibration on a website anyway. Imparus PWA, I mentioned game, since PWA is one of the new thing that is very likely to become huge in the next few years. Here you can try some few application made in it https://pwa.rocks/ so it is more that you should be ready for a paradigm change in what a website is, since the line between webapp and normal app will almost disappear. Example I use the QR scanner, so I don't have to have a dedicated app for it. My1 well honestly I think the PWA stuff is taking it too far, especially games, I mean dont they run better when compiled and optimized for an OS? also websites are supposed to work on any device that has a more or less modern browser and when games need for example multitouch, that thing is not really funny on a device without touch, since I cant summon a second mouse arrow. and when websites are starting to lose the point of working pretty much everywhere and becoming a gimmick it's starting to get stupid. especially if you have a bad internet connection these PWAs arent as great as when you just have your application. with the browser opening more and more, it's seriously going to risk opening itself to viruses and stuff Imparus I unfortunately don't have the time at the moment to explain all of these to you, so this will be quick rundown, and the rest you will have to research yourself if you are interested in it. "well honestly I think the PWA stuff is taking it too far, especially games, I mean dont they run better when compiled and optimized for an OS? " For most stuff it isn't a problem at all, as for game if they are simple enough optimization isn't as relevant. Most game would be written for an engine like unity or unreal, and one of the new thing in relation to PWA are modules, that will allow the use of engine like that, it also allow webapps to work completely offline. There will of course be some apps that are very heavy in computation on device that will make sense to run with native code that can run better, but there are being worked on optimizing things such as JS to make it run faster. "also websites are supposed to work on any device that has a more or less modern browser and when games need for example multitouch, that thing is not really funny on a device without touch, since I cant summon a second mouse arrow." You can have the browser serve different code depending on the device, that actually isn't anything new. "and when websites are starting to lose the point of working pretty much everywhere and becoming a gimmick it's starting to get stupid. " PWA actually allow apps to work everywhere, instead of just the OS you coded it to. Having one single code base would be great for pretty much every company. "especially if you have a bad internet connection these PWAs arent as great as when you just have your application." You can easily code for it to work offline, take the QR scanner on the side I linked you, I don't need internet to use it at all. Think of PWA like normal apps, if you use twitter then try using the PWA they have created. "with the browser opening more and more, it's seriously going to risk opening itself to viruses and stuff" Not really, this is one of the thing I will say you need to research yourself, since it will be quite a long explanation, I would start by looking into why chromeOS is more secure than Windows. I said there will be a huge grow with PWA over the next few years, since it is still very early in its development, only Firefox and Chrome support it at the moment and Edge will bring support in fall. AintaDamnThingFunny Right, but websites always ask me for permission if I want their notifications. Facebook using the vibrator API with your permission is one thing. Having an obtrusive add use it without your permission is another. Imparus That is because a website don't need to ask for permission, so it is more that Google should make it a permission check before allowing to use the vibration. Santos Chavez OMG I hate those types of ads! Especially when the ads that popup are so obstrusive I can't do anything but exit Chrome. Ugh! Rob Yeah, but some people love the vibrator API. hooch Holy shit I didn't even know this was a thing. Been using Firefox + uBlock Origin for a couple of years. blindexecutioner Doesn't affect me much. I already block ads. Nathan J It's not meant to affect you or I or anyone else who knows what uBlock Origin is. Google Chrome is the most popular browser, so I imagine what it will affect is the 60% or however many people use Chrome, and all of a sudden they're blocking malicious ads. That will affect a lot. I suspect for you and I, we will probably be able to just disable Google's solution and use our own, and if Google blocks other ad blockers, there's always Chromium. AS The biggest annoyances for me are subscribe popovers and EU cookie warnings. Things like taboola and outbrain need to be aggressively blocked. My1 cookie warning are annoying but it shows the scary relatity of all the sites that collect data with cookies. Lateef Alabi-Oki I'll disable my ad blocker if this gets rid of malicious and egregious ads. Nexus Hexus I'm sure most of these "Bad ads" will be alternative media. Or aka "Whatever we don't agree with" boop It's not content that's blocked, but format. Sonny Bono Ironically, all the ads that I find bothersome are on google services themselves, such as YouTube, but I have a Chrome extension (ublock origin) that works to get rid of them. Santos Chavez I enjoy YouTube so much, I pay for YouTube Red, via the Google Play Music Family Plan . Haven't seen an ad, especially on mobile. for months, and I get unlimited music streaming and downloading, all of those features shared to 5 other users. Pretty neat. Sonny Bono If they throw in free movies with the service I'd be down. I can already get anything I want on demand for no cost. I just appreciate watching random videos and I never know what I'm in the mood for. I'll just keep riding the links down the chain, bar tricks, gun porn, rocket engines, science experiments, old computers, animals and hunting videos... whatever it might be. ublock origin fixes the problem with ads - they don't exist any more - but not with popup windows on some questionable websites. abc Good for you. I use an adblocker and don't see any ads on Youtube. And I don't feel bad taking cents away from a multi-billion dollar corporation. I will never pay for streaming services because I like to own things. I could pay Netflix hundreds of dollars over the course of years, and the moment I disconnect, I am left with zero movies. I'd much rather grab some discs from the bargain bin. Gary But do they block those annoying as hell forced Google surveys? Adam Margeson Forced Google surveys? Where are you seeing those served up? And, are you sure they're legitimately from Google? Lord Argyris "...Google confirmed that Chrome will soon not show ads, including those served by Google, on websites not in compliance with the Better Ads Standards." I'm going to guess they're including their own ads here to avoid anticompetitive suits from competing ad providers. If they just blocked the other ads and left their own (presumably compliant ads), they would be gaining an unfair advantage and could be seen to be leveraging their strength in the browser market to incentivize use of their own ad platform. I wondered about this in my comment on the previous AP article on the subject, and it seems Google has considered the matter as well. Santos Chavez Yeah, it's kinda neat; by doing it that way Google avoids all sorts of blames of being hypocrites while also setting the example for everyone. "THIS", they say, "is how ads should be done. Look, we're even doing them to our own; you should, too". Terra Remove the ads that play before a video and we got a deal. Small banners below the video? Ok. Playing a commercial before the content I actually want to see? That is old tv bullcrap and is annoying as hell, even more so than popups. Dennis Ulijn "But, but, but... Terra: how would you solve this on Chromecast, etc.?" tigerberry Playing a commercial WHILE PLAYING THE DAMN VIDEO I'M ACTUALLY WATCHING? Whoever came up with that should be forced to never use an adblocker ever again. Cakefish Wonderful. Please also add extension support to Android Chrome (it's the number 1 feature that it's missing, desktop Chrome wouldn't have been as popular without it) but this is a good start. Ghirahim Install Opera and have a wonderful life. Jun rip pornhub ads Rod I wonder when they will fix the Notification Download Service bug in v58. https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=719641# Rob Thank goodness. Somehow, we went from doing away with auto-play videos and ads years ago, only to have them pop up a lot in recent months. I'm sick of them. BC Google is finally making a move that I truly approve of. Ads, especially the invasive ones have really taken over. I don't care about banner ads that I see just once or ads on the side. The ones that infuriate me the most are those that obscure content, automatically play loud sounds/videos. Those that try to trick the user into installing something they don't obviously need, need to die in a fire. It's why I've installed Ghostery and use Mercury Reader to banish that bullshit to the depths of the internet hell. I'm also pleased that Google is being smart about this and blocking all invasive content...Even if it comes directly from their company because they need to be impartial and control these insanely bad adverts. Forcing a standard will hopefully make the internet a cleaner place, one that can support the advert model without being deliberately invasive or deceptive. Dragos Lucian The only thing that makes me use an adblocker on a lot of websites, is because, more often than not, you don't even need to click on the ads to be presented with a buttload of new tabs or individual pages. You just need to click on a blank area and boom ! You can barely make your way back to the page you initially were. If those type of ads go away, then I'll make sure to uninstall my adblocker. Till then, fuck everyone who posts those type of ads on their websites in order to gain revenue. Make your money off selling socks. Abhishek Mittal Does this mean my phone wont start buzzing and downloading unwanted apps without my permission? This is huge, a great step by google in improving quality of the internet Spinkick Does it bother anyone that google is the one that decides which ads are bad? abc Google means that they are going to block their competitors ads and only allow their own.

[Update: Site is live, more details] Google launches Funding Choices, a way for users to pay sites to hide ads Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/06/01 8:01pm PDTJun 1, 2017 54 Plus 1 on G+ 126 Share on Facebook 77 Share on Twitter Total Shares257 Games News Update 1: 2017/06/01 8:01pm PDT The new site for Google Contributor/Funding Choices is live, and offers some new insight into how the service actually works. According to the signup page, each page without ads You may recall Google Contributor, which was a service by Google that allowed users to pay a monthly contribution to see fewer ads online. Your money would directly substitute the money earned by the site for advertisements. Contributor was discontinued in late 2016, with Google saying that an improved version would become available in "early 2017." Today, the company launched Funding Choices, the successor to Contributor. Currently in beta, it allows sites to show a customized message to visitors using an ad blocker. The message asks users to either enable ads for the site, or pay for a pass through Contributor that removes all ads on that site. Unlike the original Contributor, Funding Choices hides more than just AdSense ads If you're reading this and thinking, "I really wish Android Police would do this," then you're in luck. We've been part of Google's internal beta, but we're not quite ready to roll it out. Just know that we are definitely working on it. The new Contributor site doesn't seem to be live yet, but there will likely be more details there soon. Source: Google Update 1: 2017/06/01 8:01pm PDT The new site for Google Contributor/Funding Choices is live, and offers some new insight into how the service actually works. According to the signup page, each page without ads that you view on a site costs a small amount, with publishers apparently able to change the price (most of them seem to use $0.01 per page right now). So assuming $0.01 per page, $1 gets you 100 pages without ads, and Google is offering a $5 pass to start out with. Not bad pricing at all, as long as sites stay around the $0.01 price point. Google also offers a list of sites supporting Google Contributor, which currently includes Beliefnet, Business Insider UK, ComicBook, Eurogamer, Grub Street, Hot Air, Parkers, Patheos, Popular Mechanics, Townhall, Twitchy, and World Wide Gaming.

NexusPhan The ads in AP are not bad. Very reasonable and not intrusive at all. I have this site whitelisted to help support their great work. You should consider it too before funding choices goes live. MJ There is certainly websites with much more obnoxious ads but their is a lot of ads on AP. It's just not an acceptable user experience and I not going to subject myself to it. I have been calling for a way to donate to AP for awhile now (why did AP have to wait for a Google solution?) so we see how this plays out. Zachary Dunn Ecommerce is hard. Most small outlets like AP prefer a platform that can handle the security and financial liability. MJ I am not talking about ecommerce but making donations. LOL Alex Dueppen Unfortunately Disqus hasn't been the same way, it seems to often load ads that redirect you to those scam "You are winner" pages that try to look like facebook. Adriannacsmith Google is paying 97$ per hour! Work for few hours & have longer with friends and family! !dy164c: On tuesday I got a great new Land Rover Range Rover from having earned $8752 this last four weeks.. Its the most-financialy rewarding I've had.. Follow this link for more information !dy164c: ➽➽ ➽➽;➽➽ http://GoogleFinancialCashJobs454MarketDriveGetPaid$97/Hour... ★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫::::::!dy164c:....,..... Maxr1998 I hope these cancerous, unblockable Outbrain ads will also be a part of the funding choices, then I'll happily pay - not that I wouldn't contribute anyway, because I feel a bit guilty for blocking ads for a long time already.. Eli Stevens I do the job from comfort and ease of my residence, participating in effortless activities that just require from you a Laptop together with internet access and I am just pleased than ever... After 6 months in this job and therefore managed to get remunerated in whole 36,000 usd... Mainly I get approximately 80 bucks/h and work for 3 to 4 hours constantly.And magnificent factor with this job is the fact that you can supervise time when you do the job and for just how long as you wish for and you attain a check week by week.>>>> learn by clicking here how to do it right now needa I use adguard. No outbrain. Just an empty spot above the comments section with sponsored content in one corner and recommended by Outbrain in another. Maxr1998 Hm, interesting. I'm using adaway, maybe I need to tweak my filter lists a little then.. NeverrKnowsBest I have gotten full screen malware ads from AP before. I did not want to block them, but they forced my hand. NexusPhan They did have a bad streak of ads for a while about a year ago. I remember that now that you say it. I enabled ad blocker for a few months after it happened. Corbin Davenport I will say that those are normally from Disqus, and we've worked with Disqus in the past to identify them and get them removed. ZettabyteGamer I'm sure it would be hard but if disqus is causing so many problems, maybe you should switch to a different comment section or make your own? needa They would just have to throw more ads up themselves to pay for it. Disqus is pretty good anyways. Not to mention Disqus is a way to get new people to come back to your site. Meaning some guy that already has a disqus acct, but found the site because he needs a new phone, can instantly comment without having to sign up for another account at another site. needa I never thought about Disqus throwing in ads. Sort of makes me feel like an idiot for not seeing what is right in front of me. Now it all makes sense. Thanks. Marcelove Would you work to remove the Outbrain and Taboola cancer networks too? Keep any of those at AP makes any other changes useless... tnt How can you tell what is from Disqus vs the site? Justin W I'd agree that AP's ads aren't bad, but Disqus's are terrible. Irwin LOL are you seriuos? on mobile, like half the site is all ads. It's ridiculous. blueman24 I'm ok with whitelist for sites like AP on desktop but on mobile, I don't want any ads. AP can add 5 more ads on their desktop site but don't cripple performance on my already slow phone. Marcelove Never while it still use Taboola or Outbrain as ads delivers... Both are cancers and any site promoting them shall stay adblocked... No matter how much I like a site, or as good it is, if it decides to use those networks... Doing that equals being automatically added and never removed from my blacklist and everyone should do that to enforce it is unacceptable... tnt I'm with you 100%. They're pure trash. Add Revcontent in there as well. wow Why are they "cancers"? I mean, from what I see outbrain ads are trashy and slow but I don't understand why that's an automatic blacklist for a site that provides quality content for free. Do they have malware or something? (This is referring to those fake news ads above the comment section, right?) EcE APK Mirror - - I do not feel guilty and will happily wait my 10 seconds rather than see 200 ads per page and pop ups (or whatever they are called which are basically the same) whenever I need an APK. Rashad Would it be a one time cost or is this a cost each time we visit a participating site? Corbin Davenport I believe it's a monthly subscription, just like the previous Contributor. MJ Questions? Why did AP have to wait for a Google solution? There are many ways you could have been collecting money all this time. A automatic monthly subscription? Sounds like a loser already as people hate that. It's not going to be a set amount but like pick an amount right? An annual subscription would make more sense. Why can't there just be a simple donate button so people could send money when they can and just continuing blocking the ads ourselves like we have been already doing? Cai Copley It's that you do it in one, centralized location for such a subscription, and not doing it over a series of sites and forgetting how much you're spending. MJ I guess need more details on how it works... Jeff Beck We'll have a special rate for you MJ. .005 cents per article, $15 per grumpy comment submitted. We are going to make a fortune off you ;) Maxr1998 Starting the day with a smile thanks to your witty comments. Thanks Jeff! :D George https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4ba5750c423a92daff44db461bb3042c433e0f5e7edc1f8dadcb32198db0d5e8.jpg Artem Russakovskii It's almost here. Just finishing final testing. Mark Curtis Or just block ads and not pay! I'm entitled to free content! gimme gimme gimme. faceless128 it's about safety. there are so many malicious advertisements out there. if a site doesn't directly control the ads that show up, how can they ensure our safety? Camerooni I use privacy badger.. if it blocks ads that play bad - I'm okay with that alongside blocking tracking cookies etc. What I don't like is sites assuming that if you're blocking an ad network that plays bad with you that you're the bad guy.. Things have to work both ways. Mark Curtis AdBlocking started way back when they were simple JPGs with no JavaScript at all. It could even go back to that and people would complain about having to download the bytes. Ailín Ó’S I wonder will this work internationally or just USA only because I use adblock and don't have AP (for example) whitelisted because of the sheer volume of ads on the site especially from the likes of Disqus with their "Congrats! You're a winner!" and "Local man makes 999.999€ a day with this trick!" spam. cadtek91 I'd imagine it would work with anyone with a Google account? Fabrice Thomas Seems like it's only available in these contries: US, Germany, New Zealand and UK https://support.google.com/contributor/answer/6182581?hl=en Jeff Beck If you want to just pay me directly I'll give you my PayPal address. That'll make things even easier on you. I know, I'm way too nice to you all, you're welcome. DavidW dogecoins or gtfo TechGuy22 Thanks but I'll stick adblock and adaway needa If you guys are wanting input, which I know you didn't ask for, five bucks a year would be my max. Not sure how it works, but I would want that on my mobile device. Desktop chrome has what I need in an extension. Ultimately that would earn more money from me, as i get on this sight far less with mobile chrome. Good_Ole_Pinocchio 5 bucks a year? What does that Pay for? Beer for the staff? needa If everyone that comes to this site with adblock paid five bucks, I doubt they would complain. Jeffrey Spiers Brave browser has this built into the browser directly, have used the feature on some of my most frequented sites. Switched to Brave due to many sites detecting and bitching about ad blockers recently. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Web Ads are trash, always. But I've never used ad blockers. Because if I'm taking the content, I'm taking the ads, or I just don't go to the site if the ads are really horrible. I'd more than pay for no ads. psy spy You have to sign in to your gmail account for this to work? Easier to track us. _jack_ It would be nicer to have this from another company, yes. I also wonder, how much Google keeps for themselves? Godspoken Would there even be a difference between you being signed in to your Google account with this vs without? You're using Android and Google services, I don't know what you'd expect. abc I don't browse from my phone so I'm rarely signed into Google, and this will blow some people's minds on this site - but some of us only use two or three Google apps/services, not the whole damn suite. Lord Argyris The official blurb is a little vague. Each time I visit a page without ads, my pass/account/whatever has the site's chosen cost deducted from it. What constitutes a "page"? If I refresh the tab, does that count as an additional page load? What if I visit an article again at a later date? What about those obnoxious sites that have an automatic reload timer? Could they game FC users? I'm sure all these questions will be answered in time. What I would have liked to have seen is some sort of a multiple tier system, whereby I can select specific participants (e.g AP) and offer to pay a flat monthly rate rather than a per-page fee, then leave the normal fee structure in place for others. It would be an easy way to donate more than I would ordinarily accumulate to places I come frequently, without forcing said sites to set up their own donation system. No matter what tier FC visitors choose, the site gets money. FelschR It's stated quite clearly: "Note: you are charged each time you visit or refresh a page, even if you have previously visited it." https://support.google.com/contributor/answer/7359560?hl=en&ref_topic=6182570 Lord Argyris Okay, that answers that. The blurb on the page linked in the article lacked that more detailed information. Matías Duarte I've only used AdBlock for AP the moment that those ads magically opened a new popup while scrolling without even touching them. Now that the annoying problem is gone, I've disabled it. I know no one cares about this but I finally got accepted for a job and I'll get my very first payment tomorrow, so I would happily pay a contribution for this page! Jeff Beck I'll be one to care. Congrats! Getting paid is awesome. At least that's what the other writers at AP tell me. Kostas 💪🎩 😂😂😂😂😂😂 imneveral0ne I just had a you're a winner one pop up on my phone with android police, so it's definitely not gone. ZettabyteGamer How long till I can use this with you guys? I'm itching to try it out, but this is the only site I really read everyday. Necdet Ali Özdür I think the real question here is what Google means by "fewer ads". Are all kinds of ads will be blocked or just intrusive ones? Will the trackers also be removed? someone755 Hmmm... https://youtu.be/4ezd24krgiQ Powsniffer0110 I'd be happy to pay 1¢ an article on AP and Phandroid, XDA ect.! Powsniffer0110 This is funny as hell lol. We're now paying Google to NOT give us ads... Haha. YaKillaCJ Or continue using AdAway, uBlock Origins and DNS Host Blocking via my router. Many can say what they want but my stance is simple. I won't pay just to "not be inconvenienced and intrused on". Any dev, content providers or ect can easily find many non intrusive ways to advertise. Just_No_Stop This whole situation could have been avoided if ads weren't so intrusive, ugly, malicious, irrelevant and numerous. Some pages use less than a tenth of the data with ads blocked, which is crazy, and any ad that slows the delivery of content is unacceptable. It still baffles me how such appalling ads can be effective, if they piss you off why would you then want the product? Paying not to have to put up with such things is not on, I will keep blocking until sites have better ad policies. dancedar1 'Google offering a $5 pass' reads as though they are giving you $5 credit to try it out - they're not; it's £/$5 minimum mattcoz I also read it that way. 4Ui812 1 cent per page isn't a sustainable business model once users realize how much money they'll blow through. Sites that depend on advertising would be better served by using some sort of royalties model like the way radio stations do with music and artists/labels. Otherwise ad blockers are here to stay.Of course Google will want they're cut. 4Ui812 I'd be willing to turn off my ad blocker and sign up Google Contributor/Funding Choices for the free $5 and then I'd blow it all on this site so you guys and gals can have the money. Once it's gone though my ad blocker will be turned back on :-) Ad blocker is used for security reasons. tmartin Will it remove that Outbrain chum? I really need that stuff to go away. needa I use adguard and there is not one single avertisement on this page. There is a spot for outbrain, but no ads. tmartin I use Ghostery mostly because of the chum and that takes care of it, but I wouldn't mind supporting AP. needa I wouldn't mind either. I turn my blocker off periodically to help out. From the looks of it Google will have the answers we need soon enough with their new chrome filter that they are working on. Hopefully then we will be able to support our favorite sites without being slowed down by the ads. Marcelove Wall Street Journal will use it or it will keep that aggressive paywall? Because allowing only 10 articles is like grabbing the print version, take only one sheet and give to someone saying "If you wanna read more than 1 sheet per month, you need to pay us". I'm not against a publisher using a paywall, but the restriction here is so absurd that even if I was 100% determined to subscribe, I wouldn't only because at this example the newspaper is being douchebag... 30 articles, or 1 per day, would really mean that it was caring about itself and the public... But only 10 shows that it don't give a f*ck about the public and is only caring about itself... Anthony Castanza This is a substantial regression from the old version. Morten Ulv How did the old one work? rap 1¢ per page would add up very fast. By the time I read a couple of favorite blogs each day that would be $20 per month. jdrch $0.01 per page sounds doable. Lars Jeppesen Not available in my countries... Gen. Chang The point is to force the ad industry and websites to change the way they operate. Not reward them for more bad behavior. If it was not for the privacy intrusive models they use, there would not be as big a problem.

Joe Mullin - Jun 2, 2017 5:15 pm UTC Enlarge Photo by Thomas Trutschel/Photothek via Getty Images reader comments 240 Share this story News that Google intends to install an ad-blocker in its Chrome browser shocked the tech and publishing world in April. Now, details of how the program will work are starting to become clear. The Google ad-blocker will block all advertising on sites that have a certain number of "unacceptable ads," according to The Wall Street Journal. That includes ads that have pop-ups, auto-playing video, and "prestitial" count-down ads that delay the display of content. Further ReadingReport: Google will add an ad blocker to all versions of Chrome Web browserGoogle, which refers to the ad-blocker as an ad "filter," is using a list of unacceptable ad types provided by the Coalition for Better Ads, an advertising industry trade group. Google has already discussed its plans with publishers, who will get at least six months to prepare for the change coming early in 2018. Publishers will get a tool called "Ad Experience Reports," which "will alert them to offending ads on their sites and explain how to fix the issues," the Journal reports. The details were also publicized by Google in a blog post yesterday. "[I]t’s far too common that people encounter annoying, intrusive ads on the web—like the kind that blare music unexpectedly, or force you to wait 10 seconds before you can see the content on the page," wrote Sridhar Ramaswamy, Google's Senior VP for Ads & Commerce. "These frustrating experiences can lead some people to block all ads—taking a big toll on the content creators, journalists, web developers and videographers who depend on ads to fund their content creation." Next year, Chrome will stop showing ads, including ads "owned or served" by Google, on websites that aren't compliant with the Coalition for Better Ads standards. Publishers with repeat violations of Google's ad policies will get 30 days to correct them Google is also offering a tool called "Funding Choices," which would present users who have non-Chrome ad blockers with a message asking them to disable their ad-blockers or pay to remove advertising. Ad-blocking remains a controversial topic in the online publishing world, where it has had a major impact on revenue in recent years. About one-quarter of US users are using some form of ad-blocker, and the numbers are higher in other countries. At first glance, it's surprising that Google, the world's largest Web advertising company, would want to promote ad-blockers. But it can also be viewed as a defensive move to give the company more control over what types of ads flourish on the Web, given that more people will turn to competing ad-blockers if Google does nothing. Chrome is the most popular Web browser, with more than 50 percent of the market. The Chrome ad-blocker is likely to be turned on by default. Any decisions by Google about what ads are "acceptable" will have a huge effect on the online advertising space. This post was updated Friday afternoon with details from Google's blog post.  Joe Mullin Joe has covered the intersection of law and technology, including the world's biggest copyright and patent battles, since 2007.

There are dozens upon dozens of great options on the market today, but finding the best of the best can be a bit difficult. We’ve seen some great launches through the year and more should be coming soon too, so let’s take a look at the best Android smartphones you can buy as of June 2017. The best gifts for Android users NEW FOR JUNE: HTC U11 HTC hasn’t seen too much success in the past two years, but the company’s latest flagship, the HTC U11, looks like a winner as far as I’m concerned. The U11 offers up a design similar to that of the HTC U Ultra with a “liquid” glass finish and top of the line specifications. HTC has included the new “Edge Sense” pressure sensitivity tech for quick launching apps and shortcuts, and the device also features the latest version of Android Nougat out of the box. Under the hood, the HTC U11 offers up the Snapdragon 835 processor, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, and a 3,000 mAh battery. There’s no 3.5mm headphone jack, but the device does offer USB-C headphones in the box as well as an adapter for using traditional headphones. The phone is also IP67 rated for dust and water resistance. One of the biggest attractions for the U11 is the camera. The 12MP f/1.7 sensor has a DxOMark rating of 90, topping the charts and even beating out the Google Pixel. Early sample shots seem to live up to that rating, but we’ll have to wait to get the phone in-house before rendering a final verdict. Pre-orders for the U11 are open now in the US, shipping starts on June 9th. BlackBerry Keyone The other big release for June is the BlackBerry Keyone which just went on sale at the end of May. This device is a return to the good ol’ days for BlackBerry, including that always-available full physical keyboard right below the display. The KeyOne runs on top of a Snapdragon 625 chipset, 3GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, and has a 4.5-inch display. That sounds small, but it’s due to the fact that the device has that keyboard below. The phone ships with Android 7.1.1 and the latest Android security patch. Further, it offers up BlackBerry’s special security enhancements and a surprisingly good 12MP camera on the rear. Obviously, the Keyone isn’t the phone for everyone, especially at $549, but it is an excellent option nonetheless. Sales of the phone are available now with the GSM variant available via Best Buy and Amazon, and the Verizon-compatible CDMA option available at Amazon. Sales at Sprint kick off “soon.” Best Affordable Android Smartphones – June 2017 FROM EARLIER THIS YEAR: Samsung Galaxy S8/Galaxy S8+ After going on sale late last month, Samsung’s latest pair of flagship phones, the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ are off to a fantastic start. The new bezel-light phones usher in a new design language for Samsung with further revised software with new features like Bixby. The Galaxy S8 is a 5.8-inch device where the S8+ is a 6.2-inch monster, or at least, it would be without this design. Thanks to the thin bezels all around, the S8 and S8+ are both very compact compared to devices with similar or even smaller screen sizes. It’s impressive both in pictures and in person. Under the hood, the Galaxy S8 packs the Snapdragon 835, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, and a microSD card slot. There’s also USB-C for quick charging and data transfer, as well as video output via Samsung’s DeX dock which offers up a full desktop environment when plugged into the necessary peripherals. The S8 also packs Nougat out the box with a cleaner software build. Pricing is for the Galaxy S8 starts at around $750, while the larger S8+ comes in at around $850. Both devices are available now via Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, Best Buy, and Sprint. Unlocked units are also available now. LG G6 One of the more impressive debuts to come out of MWC 2017 was the LG G6 ─ the company’s new bezel-light flagship for the year. After the failure that was the LG G5, the company needs a win, and it might just have that in the G6. Packed inside of the LG G6 is a Snapdragon 821 chipset, 4GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, wireless charging, USB-C, Android Nougat, Google Assistant, and a 3,300 mAh battery. However, the biggest story here is what you can actually see. First of all, the LG G6 has super thin bezels on all sides, allowing that 5.7-inch display to fit into the footprint of a phone with a much smaller display. Then, there’s the removal of the modular components, making room for IP68 protection against dust and water. The LG G6 is a pretty solid smartphone, but it’s not perfect. As we noted in our review, the device still lacks in certain areas such as performance. That said, it’s still a fantastic device. You can order now from Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint, B&HPhoto, and Best Buy. Google Pixel/Pixel XL When talking about the best Android phones, there’s no way to avoid talking about the Google Pixel and Pixel XL. These two smartphones, designed by Google from the ground up, show off the best that the company has to offer, and it’s impressive. While not perfect, Google’s efforts with the Pixel show just how good Android can be, both in terms of stability, performance, and the overall experience. The Pixel packs top-tier specs including the Snapdragon 821 chipset, 4GB of RAM, 32 or 128GB of storage, and the breathtaking 12.3MP camera on the back. Google’s services are pre-loaded out of the box, the latest version of Android is pushed immediately, and Google Assistant is showcased front and center. Other perks include the 24/7 support, unlimited full resolution photo and video backups, and support for Google’s all new Daydream VR experience. Pricing for the Pixel starts at $649 for the 5-inch variant and $769 for the larger 5.5-inch Pixel XL. Add $100 to either for the 128GB storage tier. Monthly financing is available both through the Google Store and Verizon Wireless. Huawei P10/P10 Plus MWC 2017 also saw the early debut of Huawei’s flagship P Series device for 2017 ─ the Huawei P10. The P10 isn’t a massive departure from 2016’s P9, but it still brings some welcome enhancements. First, the P10 has picked up the same great Leica dual-camera system from the Mate 9, and has also brought several new color options to the table, as well as a new, unique metal build. Further, the P10 offers EMUI 5.1 and a new front-facing fingerprint sensor that can double as navigation buttons. The P10 runs on top of the Kirin 960 chipset, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, and a 3,200 mAh battery with Nougat and a 5.1-inch 1080p display. The P10 Plus, on the other hand, brings 6GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, and a much bigger 3,750mAh battery, under a 5.5-inch QHD display. Unfortunately, we don’t have any details just yet on what the P10 and P10 Plus will cost. Both phones are available now overseas, but they won’t be coming to the US. You can read our full review here. OnePlus 3T Announced toward the end of 2016, the OnePlus 3T is the successor to the OnePlus 3, although it’s really just a slight refresh. Compared to the OnePlus 3 the 3T brings the updated Snapdragon 821 chipset, a larger 3,400 mAh battery, a new color variant, and an updated 16MP front facing camera sensor. Aside from that, the OnePlus 3T is the same as the OnePlus 3, bringing Dash Charge fast charging, a 5.5-inch 1080p Optic AMOLED display, 6GB of RAM, and USB-C — all wrapped up in that aluminum chassis. Starting at $439, it’s slightly more expensive than the OnePlus 3 was, but not without reason. The phone is available now from OnePlus’ website, but it probably won’t be around too much longer as the company prepares for the OnePlus 5. Huawei Mate 9 As expected, Huawei launched the Mate 9 in the US market at CES 2017 for the pretty reasonable price of $599. Packed inside of its gorgeous aluminum design, the Mate 9 has Huawei’s in-house Kirin 960 chipset, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, a dual-camera system, a 5.9-inch 1080p display, and Android Nougat. Alongside Google’s latest OS, Huawei has also included the latest version of its EMUI software skin, and it’s finally pretty good. The Mate 9 will also be updated in the coming weeks to include Amazon’s Alexa digital assistant in place of the Pixel-locked Google Assistant. We’ll be revisiting the device soon, but in the meantime, you can read our full review here and buy the phone from Amazon, Best Buy, B&H Photo, Jet.com, or Newegg for $599 unlocked. It works on any GSM carrier including T-Mobile and AT&T. LG V20 If you want a big, feature-rich phone, the LG V20 might be your best bet. Packing a 5.7-inch Quad HD IPS display, Snapdragon 820 chipset, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, and a 3,200 mAh removable battery, the V20 is a power user’s phone without question. This is only emphasized with the dual-camera system on the back which can take standard and wide-angle pictures as well as bringing enhanced stabilization in video. Entertainment only gets better with the built-in 32-bit HiFi DAC which makes listening to music a joy. The LG V20 is one of the best smartphones we’ve used this year, but the most surprising thing about it is the price. While a similar option from Samsung, Apple, or Google could cost you well upwards of $800, the V20 averages out at about $770. Pricing varies by carrier, landing at $672 on Verizon at its lowest point and $830 on AT&T and its highest. Monthly pricing across all major carriers lands at around $28 a month and the phone is available via Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, US Cellular, and Sprint. You can also pick it up unlocked. We’ve also seen some pretty spectacular deals on the phone, cutting the price by hundreds. Moto Z/Moto Z Force From Motorola/Lenovo, one, or rather two, of the best options you can pick up come in the form of the Moto Z and the Moto Z Force. Both devices pack 5.5-inch AMOLED displays, the Snapdragon 820 processor, 4GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, and Motorola’s thin software layer on top of Android. The Moto Z brings a 2,600 mAh battery, 13MP camera, and comes in at just 5.2mm thin. The Moto Z Force, on the other hand, brings a 3,500 mAh battery, 21MP rear camera, and is 7mm thin. It also brings a ‘ShatterShield’ display which won’t break. Unfortunately, that model is exclusive to Verizon Wireless. Both devices run on top of Android Nougat, and lack headphone jacks. However, they do include USB-C adapters in the box. That port also includes Turbo Charging which promises up to 15 hours of power with a 15-minute charge. Both are also compatible with Google’s Daydream VR platform. The big story, though, is without a doubt the compatibility with Moto Mods, a method of expanding the phone’s capabilities with modules such as battery packs, speakers, and even a camera. The Moto Z Force is available on Verizon Wireless as is the Moto Z, but the latter is also available unlocked through outlets like Amazon. ZTE Axon 7 If you want a flagship experience, but at a slightly lower price point, the ZTE Axon 7 is an option worth considering. Starting at just $399, the Axon 7 packs a 5.5-inch AMOLED display, all-metal design, front facing speakers, and premium specifications including the top of the line Snapdragon 820 chipset. It also packs 4GB of RAM and support for Google Daydream, all while running on top of Android Nougat. The ZTE Axon 7 is available for purchase from ZTE, Amazon, and many other retailers around the web for $399 unlocked for use on GSM carriers.

Between a Google phone and Google tablet, users could easily activate the tethering feature without ever pulling out their smartphone. Now, as Android tablets continue to fall off the map, Google seems to be bringing this feature to Chrome OS. The best gifts for Android users As first spotted by ChromeStory, the Canary channel of Chrome OS currently houses a flag to enable instant tethering on that device. Like on tablets, this feature interacts with your nearby phone to enable tethering without ever touching the phone. Instant Tethering Chrome OS Enables Instant Tethering. Instant Tethering allows your nearby Google phone to share its Internet connection with this device. #enable-tether If you’re using the Canary channel of Chrome OS, this feature will be able via Chrome’s flags. You can access this by typing chrome://flags into the URL bar. From there, find the “enable-tether” option and toggle it to enabled, then restart the machine. Once enabled, instant tethering will appear in the quick settings menu under the “network” section. Simply toggle the feature on while you’re away from Wi-Fi and it will turn on tethering from your smartphone. Of course, you’ll need to enable this feature on your phone beforehand and will need to be using a Google Pixel/XL or Nexus device running Android Nougat. ChromeStory reports that the feature isn’t successfully working just yet, but that could be due to the device or location. Anyone with the required hardware should have the ability to at least test this out, but do keep in mind that the Canary channel of Chrome OS is very unstable so it may be best to wait until the feature graduates to more stable channels.

Tech Search Search VenezuelaThe Airline Standoff in Venezuela is Getting Worse as the Country’s Crisis Deepens aerospace and defenseOculus Founder Palmer Luckey Is Working on a Defense Startup Entrepreneur3 Questions You Should Ask Yourself Before Quitting Your Job trump budgetWhat the U.S. Loses If Trump Eliminates AmeriCorps Photographed by Getty Images Google Google Is Going Ahead With Controversial Ad Blocking Plans For Chrome Mathew Ingram Jun 02, 2017 Google has confirmed that it intends to add a new feature to its Chrome web browser that will block certain types of ads from being seen by users, and in some cases could block all the ads on websites that don't meet certain standards. The Alphabet subsidiary says it wants to work with publishers to help them understand what kinds of ads will no longer be acceptable, and the standards being built into the browser come from an industry group rather than Google. But that hasn't stopped some from criticizing the idea, since Google controls a significant share of the online ad market. Word of the new feature first emerged in April, when the Wall Street Journal reported that Google had approached some publishing partners about its plans. At the time, Cornell Law professor James Grimmelmann said that the idea of an ad blocker controlled by one of the world's largest digital-advertising companies was almost certain to raise anti-competitive concerns. If Google uses its 50%+ browser share to ship a product that blocks rivals’ ads but not Google’s own, my antitrust eyebrows go up.- James Grimmelmann (@grimmelm) April 20, 2017 In a nutshell, Chrome will now include ad-blocking features that are turned on by default (although Google prefers to call it "filtering" rather than blocking). Ads that meet certain annoying criteria will not be shown, and if a website crosses a certain threshold of substandard ads, users won't see any ads. Some of the ad types that will be blocked include pop-ups, videos that auto-play, and so-called "pre-stitial" ads that force readers to sit through a count down before they can see the page's contents. Many leading publishers rely on some or all of these strategies to boost ad revenue. This is a *crazy* amount of power Google is seizing over nearly all the funding that goes into our journalism and online content creation. pic.twitter.com/LpO1riP0An- Matt Stoller (@matthewstoller) June 2, 2017 To try to soften the blow somewhat, Google is also offering something called Funding Choices, which allows publishers to show users a note when their ads are blocked by third-party software. The note will give readers the option of either disabling their blocker or buying an ad-free pass or subscription of some kind for that site. Google reportedly pays Eyeo, the German company that owns AdBlock—the leading ad-blocking software—to have its ads automatically whitelisted, so they are not blocked. The company notes that the standards for what will be considered acceptable advertising under its new Chrome system have been developed by the Coalition for Better Ads, an industry group that includes advertisers and industry groups, media companies such as News Corp., as well as Google and Facebook. The appeal of such a feature for users and publishers is obvious. The web has become a sea of popups, pop-unders, interstitials, auto-playing videos and other annoying behavior, and growing numbers of users have responded by installing ad-blocking software like AdBlock. That causes publishers to lose revenue, which leads to even more desperate behavior. However, some media companies argue that they have no choice but to rely on these kinds of ads, because the bulk of the advertising business has been sucked up by Google and Facebook. This looks like instant antitrust to me. Restriction of competition through dominant position in browser. https://t.co/5tlPhLX0QE- Charles Arthur (@charlesarthur) June 2, 2017 According to a recent estimate by Pivotal Research, not only do the two digital giants control over 75% of the $70-billion U.S. digital ad industry, last year they accounted for almost all of the industry's growth compared to 2015. Not only that, but Google's Chrome browser has an estimated 58% share of the browser market. Other smaller players such as Internet Explorer and Firefox have built-in ad blockers, but they aren't owned by advertising companies. So in effect, what Google is rolling out is a system that will block ads by default for a majority of web users, based on standards that it and Facebook—two companies that control the bulk of the online advertising business—have a huge amount of control over. Will it improve the web for users? Probably. But at the same time, it raises some significant questions about the extent of Google's power over the advertising we see, and its increasing dominance when it comes to how publishers and media companies can make money.

Slate Sign In Sign Up There’s a Major Spoiler That Comes Up When You Google “Wonder Woman” There’s a Major Spoiler That Comes Up When You Google “Wonder Woman” Slate Sign In Sign Up Slate Brow Beat Slate's Culture Blog June 2 2017 12:40 PM There’s a Major Spoiler That Comes Up When You Google “Wonder Woman” By Marissa Martinelli   This post contains spoilers for Wonder Woman. A reminder that nowhere on the internet is truly spoiler-free: The Google search results for Wonder Woman, in theaters today, ruin the movie’s major twist by spoiling the secret identity of Ares, the Greek god of war, whom Diana of Themyscira (aka Diana Prince, aka Wonder Woman) considers to be her people’s ultimate enemy. For much of the movie, she, and we, believe Ares to be Danny Huston’s Ludendorff, a bellicose German general intent on scuttling the pending World War I armistice with a massive, unsanctioned chemical attack. But—surprise!—it’s revealed that Ares has been masquerading as David Thewlis’ Sir Patrick Morgan, a British councilor who has been openly pushing for the armistice, but apparently undermining it in secret. (He’s also, to judge by the glimpse of his muscled bare chest, been putting in some serious gym time in between Parliamentary throw-downs.) As the embodiment of war itself, he’s the movie’s true villain, and it's a good twist. Advertisement A handful of outlets had already reported on Thewlis’ identity before the movie’s release, Warner Bros. has kept a pretty tight lid on the antagonist’s identity. But if you innocently Googled “Wonder Woman” in search of theater showtimes, you’ve probably already stumbled across that secret, although you might not have realized its significance. In the search results, Thewlis is listed in the sidebar featuring the movie’s cast, as he should be, but he’s credited as Ares instead of Morgan, effectively ruining the surprise. Searching “Wonder Woman cast” brings the same perils, except this time, Thewlis’ secret identity is right at the top. Screenshot via Google Wikipedia, where Google pulls a lot of its movie information from, isn’t safe from spoilers either, also listing Thewlis as Ares. (IMDb, on the other hand, credits him as “Sir Patrick.”) Should search engines do more to preserve the mystery? That's a question for another time, but until then, this has been a PSA: Always Google responsibly before heading to the theater. Read more in Slate about Wonder Woman.

The new feature should be rolled out next year, the company writes on its blog. “We plan to have Chrome stop showing ads (including those owned or served by Google) on websites that are not compliant with the Better Ads Standards starting in early 2018,” Google’s VP of Ads and Commerce, Sridhar Ramaswamy, writes in the blog. The Better Ads Coalition recognizes the importance of advertising as a revenue source for publishers but sets guidelines that should make sure advertisements don’t disrupt user’s experience, interrupt content and cause slow browsing.  The coalition hopes that therefore users won’t resort to ad blockers, because ad blockers also block the revenue stream of well behaving, legitimate publishers. From 2018 Chrome will no longer show ads that do not adhere the Better Ads guidelines on both mobile and desktop. The feature will be enabled by default. Google will also help publishers, they will get access to a tool that can determine whether their site doesn’t violate the Better Ads rules.

NEW YORK >> Websites that run annoying ads such as pop-ups may find all ads blocked by Google’s Chrome browser starting next year. The digital-ad giant’s announcement comes as hundreds of millions of internet users have already installed ad blockers on their desktop computers and phones to combat ads that track them and make browsing sites difficult. These blockers threaten websites that rely on digital ads for revenue. Google’s version will allow ads as long as websites follow industry-created guidelines and minimize certain types of ads that consumers really hate. That includes pop-up ads, huge ads that don’t go away when you scroll down a page and video ads that start playing automatically with the sound on. Google says the feature will be turned on by default, and users can turn it off. It’ll work on both the desktop and mobile versions of Chrome. Google says that even ads it sells and manages will be blocked on websites that don’t get rid of annoying types of ads. The company is also starting a program that would help publishers deal with users who have downloaded popular ad blockers. Some individual websites have come up with their own countermeasures. Forbes.com, for example, won’t let you read stories without disabling your ad blocker or logging in with Facebook or Google accounts, so the site can track you. Google would work with websites to set up messages telling users to disable their blockers for the site or pay for a version of it with no ads. It’ll take a 10 percent cut of those payments. Facebook, too, is trying to make links from inside its universe less spammy for users. It says it’s trying to cut down on posts and ads in the news feed that lead to junky pages with “little substantive content” and “disruptive, shocking or malicious ads.” Get the latest news by email Sign Up Share this: PREV NEXT Most Read Governor’s race could be crowded City plans homeless sweep of state’s Nimitz Highway medians Servco offering repairs, loaners in Toyota recall Jio, Yamaguchi lead their teams to the path to glory Trump criticizes London mayor’s call for calm Comments () By participating in online discussions you acknowledge that you have agreed to the TERMS OF SERVICE.

Waymo confirmed to BuzzFeed its move after the outlet learned of the move through a photograph. The company said it was manually driving the vehicle on a public road to collect data. Read: Uber Waymo Lawsuit: Uber Fires Anthony Levandowski, Former Google Engineer At Center Of Case “Self-driving technology can transport people and things much more safely than we do today and reduce the thousands of trucking-related deaths each year,” a Waymo spokesperson told BuzzFeed. “We’re taking our eight years of experience in building self-driving hardware and software and conducting a technical exploration into how our technology can integrate into a truck." Waymo said it is testing only one truck. The company has already been testing self-driving vehicles, both on closed tracks and on open roads in the states of Arizona, California, Texas and Washington. Google began looking into self-driving technology in 2009 and created the unit Waymo last year. The company launched a self-driving taxi program in Phoenix in April. Waymo Vs. Uber  Meanwhile, Waymo's rival Uber has also been testing self-driving technology in Phoenix and other U.S. locations. In February, Waymo sued Uber claiming the company benefited from stolen secret self-driving car technology from the Alphabet company. “Our parent company Alphabet has long worked with Uber in many areas, and we didn’t make this decision lightly,” Waymo said in a statement at the time. The legal action was taken after Anthony Levandowski and Lior Ron, who both worked at Google, quit to start their own self-driving vehicle company Otto. That company was then acquired by Uber. Otto was bought for $680 million in August 2016, just three months after it launched operations. Waymo claims in the lawsuit that Levandowski and Ron stole self-driving technology secrets before they set off to start Otto. Read: Elon Musk Turned Down Tesla-Uber Partnership Offer Made By Travis Kalanick, New Book Says This week, Uber fired Levandowski, who was leading the company’s self-driving car venture because the engineer declined to cooperate in the lawsuit. Uber had previously asked Lewandowski in a letter to do his part with the investigation. The company asked the engineer to confirm if he did or didn’t steal documents from Google, and requested him to return any remaining records he had. Lewandowski declined to do so. In another sign of rivalry, Waymo teamed up with Uber’s competitor Lyft recently to work together on autonomous technology. Waymo and Lyft will both test self-driving cars on the road, challenging Uber. The partnership’s goal is to commercialize autonomous technology and make it mainstream. To get there, the companies would begin with with pilot projects and product development efforts. Besides Waymo and Uber, other companies are looking into self-driving technology. Elon Musk’s Tesla is set to release its Model 3 autonomous vehicle. The company is expected to start delivering the car for reservations by mid-2018 or later, according to its site. Ford is also working on self-driving technology. The company gave the public a preview of its next generation Fusion Hybrid self-driving car last December. The carmaker said it plans to put self-driving vehicles on the road by 2021 for ride-hailing services. Meanwhile, Apple has been reportedly working on its secret autonomous car unit Project Titan. The company recently hired three engineers who previously worked at NASA for its project. Apple’s rival Samsung, on the other hand, was granted permission by South Korea’s Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport last month to test run self-driving cars.

Generate Enquiries for your Business by Listing on Economictimes.com List Your Business Find Service Near You WASHINGTON: Google is working to block "annoying" ads in its Chrome browser, part of a broader effort by industry players to filter out certain types of marketing messages that draw complaints. "We believe online ads should be better. That's why we joined the Coalition for Better Ads, an industry group dedicated to improving online ads," said Sridhar Ramaswamy, Google's senior vice president for advertising in a blog post Thursday. "In dialogue with the Coalition and other industry groups, we plan to have Chrome stop showing ads (including those owned or served by Google) on websites that are not compliant with the Better Ads Standards starting in early 2018." Google's move, in the works for some time, could end up reducing some ads served and impact its own revenue, but it aims to improve the overall web experience and discourage third-party ad-blockers that could have a more dramatic impact. Ramaswamy noted that "annoying" ads prompt some people to use ad-blockers that stop all advertising content, hurting revenue for content creators. "The vast majority of online content creators fund their work with advertising," Ramaswamy said. "That means they want the ads that run on their sites to be compelling, useful and engaging -- ones that people actually want to see and interact with." But he noted that "it's far too common that people encounter annoying, intrusive ads on the web -- like the kind that blare music unexpectedly, or force you to wait 10 seconds before you can see the content on the page." Google is a founding member of the Coalition, which was formed last year and aims to maintain the online advertising ecosystem while eliminating ads that many find irritating. The group released guidelines earlier this year for ads on both mobile and desktop. But some analysts say it will be difficult for Google and others to set standards that please all parties. "It's smart for Google to be part of the push for limited ad blockers even if that may seem counterintuitive, because if it can focus that activity on egregious ads rather than all ads indiscriminately, it has a much better shot at protecting its own massive ad revenue than if others take more of a blanket approach," said Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research. "We can be certain that none of Google's own sites or ad formats will be affected by this filter, but we can also guess that there will be something of an outcry from publishers feeling that Google is favoring itself while disadvantaging others. It's going to be fascinating to watch this play out over the next few months." According to the research firm eMarketer some 27.5 percent of US internet users will use ad blockers this year.

The internet giant’s announcement comes as hundreds of millions of users have already installed blockers on their computers and phones to combat ads that track them and make browsing websites difficult, such as pop-up ads. These blockers threaten web publishers that rely on digital ads for revenue. Starting next year, Google’s version will allow ads as long as publishers follow guidelines that ban certain types that consumers really hate. They includes pop-up ads, huge ads that do not go away when a user scrolls down a page, and videos that start playing automatically with the sound on. We believe online ads should be better. Here's how we'll be supporting the Better Ads Standards → https://t.co/0rJhNijXvQ pic.twitter.com/mxruyTLsAq— Google (@Google) June 1, 2017 Google said the feature will be turned on by default, and users can turn it off. It will work on the desktop and mobile versions of Chrome. Google said that even ads it sells and manages will be blocked on websites that do not get rid of annoying types of ads. The company is also starting a programme that would help publishers deal with users who have downloaded popular ad blockers. Some individual websites have come up with their own counter-measures. Forbes.com, for example, will not let users read stories without disabling an ad blocker or logging in with Facebook or Google accounts, so the site can track them. Google aims to allow ads as long as publishers follow guidelines that ban certain types Google would work with websites to set up messages telling users to disable blockers for the site or pay for a version of it with no ads. It will take a 10% cut of those payments. Facebook is trying to make links from inside its universe less spammy for users. It says it is trying to cut down on posts and ads in the news feed that lead to pages with “little substantive content” and “disruptive, shocking or malicious ads”.

By Adrian Kingsley-Hughes for Hardware 2.0 | June 2, 2017 -- 16:00 GMT (09:00 PDT) | Topic: Apple (Image: CNET/CBS Interactive) All eyes will be on Apple as the week-long WWDC 2017 kicks off with the keynote speech. And while Apple fans will be salivating over iOS and macOS updates, along with whatever shiny new hardware is unveiled, it's Siri that will make or break the event. See also : Surface Pro (2017) vs. Surface Pro 4: Tech specs and key differences This year's WWDC will be an interesting time for Apple. For well over a decade the keynote has been a time when Apple could boast to the world -- and more importantly, other tech companies -- about how far ahead of the game it was, and how they had little hope of catching up. But this time is different. Apple is under pressure from multiple fronts. iPhone sales are teetering on the brink of a downturn, while iPad sales have crashed through the floor. And the company is lagging behind Microsoft when it comes to notebook innovation, trailing behind Amazon when it comes to getting hardware into the living room, and dawdling far behind Google and Facebook when it comes to AR and AI. iPhone 8: Everything we think we know SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 16 NEXT PREV No matter what sort of face Tim Cook and the gang put on when they're on-stage Monday, Apple is on the back foot, and it knows it. But there's one Apple product that could change all that -- Siri. It's easy to look at Apple and think of it as a hardware company. After all, when most people think "Apple," they think about the iPhone, Macs, iPads, and such. But the hardware is only part of the equation. In fact, building hardware isn't hard -- just look at how crowded the Android market is with devices ranging from treasures to total trash. Anyone with money can go to an ODM -- Original Design Manufacturer -- and get something drawn up and made. What really sets Apple hardware apart is the massive software ecosystem at the back end. Everything from iCloud to the App Store and the wider ecosystem, it's all about the software. And part of that software ecosystem is Siri. More apple iPhone 8 may not have the killer feature we've been hoping for Here's why you must back up your iPhone and iPad before upgrading to iOS 10.3 Apple to iPhone owners: We're working fast to block CIA's iOS hacks Is Apple's 'next big thing' the iPhone Pro? 10 things Steve Jobs would hate about Apple today Apple's been playing it slow and carefully with Siri. Apple acquired the technology back in April 2010 and baked it into iOS 5 in 2011, and since then the technology has spread across Apple's platforms to include macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. But with Amazon and Google carrying out a full-on assault on the living room with speakers and smart devices, it's time for Apple to push back. Because if it doesn't, these players will slowly start to chip away at and erode Apple's currently dominant ecosystem. After all, not only is someone who's purchased a smart device from Google or Amazon less likely to buy a similar Apple device, but they're also going to be looking at what else Google and Amazon have to offer, further weakening the ecosystem. Now some might say that Apple already owns the living room, kitchen, and bedroom, because it owns the smartphone, tablet, and smartwatch market, and people take these devices with them as they move about the house. But this is a weak argument. With the exception of Apple TV, Apple's hardware is aimed at a single user, and that makes it unsuited to home use. If your home automation setup is based around Apple, then you better make sure that everyone has iPhones and iPads, because it's not like you can pick up someone else's device to start controlling things. And this is where devices such as the Amazon Echo or Google Home really come into play. They're devices that are aimed at the family, not the individual, and that means they're far more convenient to use in a communal setting. I've noticed it myself. While I used to have to turn to my iPhone to control the lights or some other bit of IoT kit, it's far quicker and easier to bark a command at a nearby Echo or Dot than it is to whip out my iPhone and activate Siri. And remember to factor in how cheap Echo Dots are compared to Apple products. At $49 they're less than the price of two 2-meter Lightning cables from Apple. But Siri is the tool that will let Apple keep up with Google and Amazon, because it allows the company to create an interface-free device that people can interact with semi-naturally (I say semi-naturally because none of the voice assistants are currently up to the task of dealing with natural language, and some form of linguistic gymnastics are always required, despite what you might see in the on-stage demos). So, with all that said, here are my WWDC 2017 Siri-related predictions: A much-needed boost to Siri's AI (essentially new sets of questions and commands it can respond to) Siri will be able to recognize users based on their voice (this would be a killer feature for a communal device) A new Siri-powered device, likely a speaker, think Apple TV, but for music (given Apple's association with music, and the fact that it owns Beats) Text-based chatbot-style Siri (think along the lines of a smart search box) Make Siri able to work across devices (so, for example, Siri on the iPhone would be able to understand a command such as "open Numbers on my MacBook.")

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Sat, Jun 03, 2017 - Page 10　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Google faces hefty EU fine in shopping case Reuters, BRUSSELS EU anti-trust regulators aim to slap a hefty fine on Alphabet Inc unit Google over its shopping service before the summer break in August, two people familiar with the matter said, setting the stage for two other cases involving the US company. The European Commission’s decision will come after a seven-year investigation into the world’s most popular Internet search engine triggered by scores of complaints from US and European rivals. The EU competition authority in April 2015 accused Google of distorting Internet search results to favor its shopping service, harming both rivals and consumers. The commission and Google declined to comment. The US company has in the past rejected the charges, saying that regulators ignored competition from online retailers Amazon.com Inc and eBay Inc. Fines for companies found guilty of breaching EU anti-trust rules can reach 10 percent of their global turnover, which in Google’s case could be about US$9 billion of its turnover last year. Apart from the fine, the commission is to tell Google to stop its alleged anti-competitive practices, but it is not clear what measures it will order the company to adopt to ensure that rivals get equal treatment in Internet shopping results. The regulator could set out general principles or specific instructions for Google to follow, an observer said. The commission’s tough line is in sharp contrast with the US Federal Trade Commission, which settled its own Web search case with the company in 2013 by requiring Google to stop “scrapping” reviews and other data from rival Web sites for its own products. Google made three unsuccessful attempts to settle the case with the previous EU commissioner for competition Joaquin Almunia in a bid to stave off a possible fine and a finding of wrongdoing. However, Almunia’s successor, Margrethe Vestager, has shown no willingness to settle with Google. The company has also been charged with using its Android mobile operating system to squeeze out rivals and with blocking competitors in online search advertising related to its “AdSense for Search” platform.

Primarily set at a deserted girl’s school in snowy Upstate New York, “Blackcoat’s Daughter” oozes creepiness as a pair of students (Kiernan Shipka, Lucy Boynton) knock around the ancient buildings waiting for their late-arriving parents to pick them up. Sadly, it’s often difficult to parse what’s actually going on thanks to the flat performances, murky cinematography and jumbled chronology. Accidents, murders and even an exorcism take place and yet none of it makes much of an impression. With just a bit more narrative clarity, this horror outing could have been a keeper. On Amazon, Google, iTunes and Vudu. Also New To VOD and Streaming Fist Fight: If anyone deserves their own comedy franchise, it’s Jillian Bell who steals every movie she’s in, including “22 Jump Street,” “The Night Before” and this uneven yarn about a mild-mannered teacher (Charlie Day) who runs afoul of another instructor (Ice Cube) and is challenged to a throw-down. Despite imparting a welcome infusion of class consciousness into the comedy, “Fist Fight” starts at a fever pitch and has nowhere to go from there. Day, in particular, screeches nearly every one of his lines. That’s why the deadpan Bell is such a lethal weapon. As a randy guidance counselor who never raises her voice, she supplies one hilarious one-liner after another. On Amazon, Google, iTunes and Vudu Advertisement XX: More women should direct horror movies. If you need proof, check out this scary-movie sampler which boasts four superb shorts helmed by female filmmakers. The first and last installments are particularly terrific, with Jovanka Vuckovic and Karyn Kusama uncorking riveting stories about the agonies of motherhood. In the Vuckovic segment, a mom (Natalie Brown) watches in distress as her son (Peter DeCunha) stops eating while, in the Kusama segment, a mother (Christina Kirk) comes to believe that her teenage son (Kyle Allen) is morphing into the Devil. Chilling, in all the right ways. On Amazon, Google, iTunes and Vudu The Shack: Following a family tragedy, a man named Mack (Sam Worthington) undergoes a crisis of faith, at least until he receives a note urging him to visit an abandoned shack in the middle of the woods where he discovers God (Octavia Spencer), Jesus (Avraham Aviv Alush) and the Holy Ghost (Sumire Matsubara). While most faith-based films make an effort to impart their message through involving stories, “The Shack” offers up one long sermon. Spencer is such a warm presence that she nearly makes the concept work but, after awhile, God’s endless platitudes start sounding less like the thoughts of a Supreme Being and more like koans cribbed from self-help books. On Amazon, Google, iTunes and Vudu House of Cards: Season 5: Yes, show runner Beau Willimon, who created the series and oversaw the first four seasons, recently stepped down but, if the trailer is any indication, Francis Underwood (Kevin Spacey) and wife Claire (Robin Wright) still have plenty of dirty tricks up their sleeve. Expect a popular character or two to bite the dust while the Underwoods prepare to battle two new adversaries (Patricia Clarkson, Campbell Scott). Netflix also promises this season will explore the deepening cracks in the relationship between Francis and Claire. Sounds juicy. On Netflix. Romanzo Criminale - The Complete Series: Based on the true story of Banda della Magliana, the gang which assumed leadership of the Roman underworld in the late 1970s, this Italian series is a must-see for fans of “The Sopranos.” Francesco Montanari stars as Libano, a small-timer who concocts a scheme to partner with a gang of crooks to take over the drug trade in Rome. Over the course of two seasons and 22 episodes, there’s plenty of kidnappings, gunplay and drug deals gone wrong. Stefano Sollima directs all of the episodes of the program, which ran for two seasons from 2008 to 2010. On FilmStruck. Queen Sugar - The Complete First Season: For this stellar OWN series, Oprah Winfrey collaborated with filmmaker Ava DuVernay (“Selma”) to adapt Natalie Baszile’s best-selling novel. At the center of the action are a number of estranged siblings, including journalist/activist Nova (Rutina Wesley), NBA manager Charley (Dawn-Lyen Gardner) and Ralph Angel (Kofi Siriboe), a formerly incarcerated man in dire need of redemption. Together the brothers and sisters must put their differences aside, in the wake of their father’s death, and help save their family’s ailing sugarcane farm. Teen Titles American Wrestler - The Wizard: Based on a true story, this sports drama pivots on a 17-year-old Iranian immigrant named Ali Afshar (George Kosturus) who is given the cold shoulder when he arrives to live in a small California town. Rejected by everyone but determined to fit in, he winds up joining the school’s wrestling team and soon becomes the star attraction. Jon Voight and William Fichtner co-star in this underdog saga. On Amazon, Google, iTunes and Vudu Rocktopia: Originally broadcast on PBS, this concert recorded live at the Hungarian State Opera House finds an orchestra, six world-class vocalists, a rock band and a handful of jazz and opera stars joining together to perform “Rocktopia,” a suite of songs that blends together classical music by Mozart and Beethoven with classic rock tunes by the likes of The Who, Elton John, Heart, Journey and Patti Smith. On Amazon, Google, iTunes and Vudu For The Kids My Life As A Zucchini: Nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, this cartoon aims to teach kids about the uplifting power of friendship in the face of adversity. The flick follows the adventures of nine-year-old Zucchini who, after losing his mom, is dispatched to a foster home filled with other orphans his age. He struggles to find his place among all these strangers, eventually making new pals even as he searches for a family of his own.

This year the event runs from June 5-9 and is expected to serve as the launching point for major updates to iOS and macOS, as well as some new hardware. This will be the first time in roughly 15 years that Apple will not be hosting the event at the Moscone West Convention Center in San Francisco. Instead, the the event will take place at the McEnery Convention Center in San Jose. We'll be on the ground at the conference, so be sure to check back for our coverage beginning Monday morning. There's plenty to be excited about this year, so let's dive right in. A new iPad Pro Image: Gizmodo / Alex Cranz WWDC is typically centered around software like iOS and macOS, but this year we're expecting some hardware too. The extremely credible KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says there's a good chance Apple will announce a new iPad Pro at this year's conference. Advertisement The new iPad Pro is rumored to have a 10.5-inch screen that will fit comfortably between the existing 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch models. It will also reportedly feature a new design with slimmer bezels. There's no indication of exactly how much the new device will cost-but there's a very good chance it will be priced similarly to existing models (starting at about $600). Siri speaker Image: Apple The new iPad Pro isn't the only piece of hardware expected to debut at the conference. Kuo also predicts that Apple is planning to launch a smart speaker to compete with the Amazon Echo and Google Home. In a research note viewed by MacRumors , Kuo reportedly said there is "over [a] 50 percent chance" that Apple will announce its new smart home speaker and begin selling them later in the year. Kuo said the speaker will likely produce excellent sound quality and will positioned for a higher end market (i.e. it will be more expensive) than the Amazon Echo. Sponsored Adding to swirling rumors, the extremely credible Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman reported this week that Apple "started manufacturing a long-in-the-works Siri-controlled smart speaker." Gurman reports that the speaker will differ from the Amazon Echo and Google home by offering virtual surround sound technology and deep integration into Apple products. The speaker will essentially serve as a hub to automate smart home devices through Apple's ( currently underdeveloped ) HomeKit platform. It will also help lock customers into Apple's walled garden as people begin to add more automation to their homes and subscribe to services like Apple Music. Gurman also reports that the speaker will have advanced acoustics that give it an edge over competing products like the Echo and Google Home and that Apple considered adding virtual surround sound technology similar to Sonos Trueplay. Advertisement It will also have comparable hardware to the Sonos Play:5 according to Kuo's research note, which says the speaker will have one subwoofer, seven tweeters, and computing power similar to the iPhone 6/6S. By comparison, as Mac Observer points out , the Echo only has one woofer and one tweeter. The Sonos Play:5 only has three woofers and three tweeters. In short, the soon-to-be-announced Siri speaker sounds much more powerful than Google Home or Amazon Echo. New MacBook and MacBook Pros Image: Gizmodo / Alex Cranz It looks all-but-certain that we'll be getting a new MacBook lineup at the conference. French website Consomac is reporting that it founds a Russian-language regulatory filing in the Eurasian Economic Commission database that points to at least five new models running macOS Sierra launching soon. Advertisement In addition to the filing, Bloomberg reports Apple will be releasing a new MacBook lineup to stave off competition from Microsoft's striking new Surface Laptop . The new MacBook Pro will get a bump to the latest seventh-generation Intel Core processors, giving it a significant hardware boost. One of the more remarkable rumors is that Apple could revive the 12-inch and 13-inch MacBook Airs by giving them a nice hardware bump, according to Bloomberg . Analysts aren't expecting any major design changes to either the MacBook or MacBook Pro, but say the new MacBook Air could have a new look. Advertisement John Gruber reported in April that Apple is working hard on a " completely rethought " Mac Pro with a modular design. The new design is supposed to accommodate high-end CPUs and GPUs and make it easier for people to update the computer with new components on a regular basis. The company is also working on pro displays to ship with the new desktops. Unfortunately, Gruber reports that the next-gen Mac Pros "will not ship this year" meaning they likely will not make an appearance at WWDC. A first look at iOS 11 Image: Gizmodo Don't get your hopes up for new iPhone models. They probably aren't coming until later this year. What you can expect at WWDC, though, is a big focus on Apple's new mobile operating system, iOS 11. We don't know much about the OS ahead of the show, but we're expecting a bunch of updates that focus on artificial intelligence. A sketchy rumor from Israeli publication the Verifier suggests that Siri will add contextual learning and better integration into Apple services like iMessage and iCloud. Advertisement Other updates to the operating system, according to 9to5Mac , could include features like group FaceTime, meaning that you'll be able to video conference multiple people from your phone. There's also a rumor that iMessage will add multi-person calls, making it easier to have up to five people join a single call. The most dramatic changes will be specifically tailored to the iPad. 9to5Mac reports that things like multi-user login to be added to the operating system while other blogs like MacRumors suggest Apple is working on expanded Apple Pencil support for the iPad Pro. Updates to macOS, WatchOS, and tvOS Last year, Apple decided to drop the "X" from its desktop operating system's name, instead calling it simply macOS. As part of the update, Apple started integrating even more iOS features into the desktop with things like Siri for Mac and Apple Pay for the web. Advertisement Advertisement This year, we're expecting to see the second iteration of macOS (10.13), but there aren't any hard details about what exactly. We should also see updates to other operating systems including WatchOS for the Apple Watch and tvOS for the Apple TV, according to the Telegraph . This essentially means that every operating system in the Apple ecosystem will receive a significant update, and that seems like a reasonable expectation considering the event is specifically tailored to get developers excited about building apps for Apple products. As always, we'll be covering the conference as news breaks, so be sure to check back here June 5-9 for more info about the latest updates, and we'll keep updating this story as more information becomes available.

Confirming previous rumours, it has said it will enable automatic ad blocking in Chrome next year. It will also withdraw its own ads from sites that use them irresponsibly. The changes represent a toughening of Google's stance on online ads amid criticism and growing ad-block use amongst web consumers. In a blog post today, the company came out in full support of the Coalition for Better Ads, an industry body that's attempting to guide publishers and ad networks towards a sustainable future. Better Ads Standards The Coalition's Better Ads Standards set out basic principles that all involved parties should follow. They describe how ad networks can make sure ads are non-intrusive. Publishers are also given advice on how to integrate ads into their pages without hindering the user experience. The thinking behind the initiative is that just one bad site could convince a user to install an ad blocker, cutting off revenue to all the others on the web. By uniting publishers, ad networks and users, the Coalition wants to find an alternative where users can come to accept ads because they don’t cause frustration or distract from the main content. Chrome ad block In a major move for the company, Google said it is going to help publishers to make their websites adhere to the Better Ads Standards. For those who don't change their ways, more aggressive action is on the way, including the threat of automatic ad blocking in Google's hugely popular Chrome web browser. After being initially rumoured a few months ago, the company has announced that Chrome is getting a built-in ad blocker. Although Google seems to be avoiding direct use of the term, it said Chrome will "stop showing ads" on websites that don't meet the Better Ads Standards from early next year. This decision will prove highly controversial amongst users and publishers. If a site fails to prepare itself in time, it could face losing its revenue from Chrome's enormous pool of users. While the net effect over time should be positive for the wider web, the immediate consequences of the move could result in some publishers having their ads disabled. Although Google is likely to extend grace periods to sites that are still upgrading their pages, the company is effectively forcing publishers to sign-up to the Better Ads Standards. The ad-block will apply to all on-page ads, including those from Google's own AdSense network. Ad Experience Report In an attempt to help publishers prepare, the company has curated resources that provide screenshots and videos of commonly annoying experiences. The new Ad Experience Report for publishers will help them to adjust their site to meet the standard, providing tips on how to stop using intrusive ad formats like auto-playing video. Google's also addressing the scenario where sites that use ads responsibly are impacted by users who visit with ad blockers installed. The company has created a new tool that publishers who meet the Better Ads Standards can add to their webpages. When a user has an ad blocker installed, it will display a message explaining that the site's ad usage has been approved as non-intrusive. There will be a prompt to enable ads for the site. Alternatively, the user can opt to buy a pass to remove the ads, offered through the new Google Contributor scheme. The tool is called Funding Choices and it's available in beta today in a few countries worldwide. Today's announcement indicates that Google has come to acknowledge the consumer frustration with the way ads currently work online. By endorsing the Better Ads Standard, it has signalled it's willing to work on the side of the user, risking seeing reductions in AdSense revenue in the near term. The move to automatically block ads in Chrome will prove divisive but the company's long-term aims are evidently to create a more sustainable monetised web that works better for all.

It will allow publishers to charge readers who have other adblockers installed a set amount per pageview, the Financial Times reported: [Google] is launching “funding choices” where publishers can set a price per page view for consumers using ad blockers to pay — or abandon their blockers and see the ads. Google will track how many pages people view and charge them through a new version of their Google Contributor service. Smart move by Google to preempt the threat from ad blockers and try to clean up online advertising – on their terms https://t.co/xnb7U7FXAq — Timo Kissel (@timokissel) June 2, 2017 Google’s own Chrome-native adblocker is expected to be turned on by default on both mobile and desktop, according to The Wall Street Journal, and will filter out “unacceptable ads,” guided in part by guidelines released by the industry group Coalition for Better Ads (of which Google, alongside other advertising companies, is a member). Google isn't just launching an ad blocker, but will organizing a system to charge people who use rival ad blockers. https://t.co/kaHHZFU9gV — Matt Stoller (@matthewstoller) June 2, 2017 Google is the dominant player in digital advertising — accounting for 40.7 percent of digital ad revenues in the U.S., according to eMarketer forecasts.

The tool will be provided before the Chrome ad blocker goes live, the people familiar with the plans say. As described to publishers, Google’s feature will block all ads on sites that have a certain level of unacceptable ads. Publishers have been advised to ensure their sites are compliant if they want their ads to be displayed.

In times like these, you need a simple, free way to view Office documents (and maybe make a few minor changes). Good news is, you can do all of that without ever leaving your Chrome browser. No need to pollute your Windows or Mac machine with Office installers, or third-party apps. You won’t even need to download files to your hard drive to view them. What Can You Do? Using the extensions highlighted below, here’s what you’ll be able to do: Preview Office documents you come across online right in the Chrome browser. No need to download the files. Preview Office documents you receive as attachments. View Office documents that you’ve saved to your PC or Mac storage. Edit local Office documents in Chrome without changing the format or uploading to Google Drive suite. For Online Documents: Docs Online Viewer Docs Online Viewer is a Chrome extension that lets you preview a variety of document formats right in the Chrome browser. Whenever you come across a link to a supported document, you’ll see a little blue cloud document icon next to the link (like in Google search page). Click on it and the document will open in a view-only mode right there. The classic Office document formats (DOC, DOCX, PPT, PPTX, XLS, XLSX) are supported. You’ll also find support for CSV, Pages, PDF, RTF and more. Docs Online Viewer actually uses Google’s own document viewer. It just bypasses Google Drive UI and directly shows you the document. You’ll be able to highlight text and copy it. To save a document as a PDF Save Your Gmail Messages as PDFs and Reach Inbox Zero Now Save Your Gmail Messages as PDFs and Reach Inbox Zero Now Whether you need to archive special emails or you just want to make a local backup of your email, this nifty extension makes it easy by saving your emails as PDFs.

Read More in Chrome, you don’t need a third party extension to preview Office documents. When you get an email with an Office document attached, you’ll see a rich preview for it in the bottom of the email (the attachments section). Just hover over the box and click where you see the title of the document. You’ll see the preview of the document as an overlay. Click on the menu button and select Open in New Tab to open the document in another tab. From here, you can also save the document as PDF by clicking the Print button and selecting Save as PDF from the popup. If you want to edit the document, click on the Open with… button on the top. Depending on the document format, the related Google app will show up here. For example, if you’re previewing a Word document, you’ll get an option to open in Google Docs. When you do that, the document will open in a new tab. For Local Documents: Office Editing for Docs, Sheets & Slides Docs Online Viewer lets you preview documents on the web. Gmail has a built-in preview for Office files. But what about the documents that you’ve downloaded to your PC or Mac? Previewing or editing them directly in Google Drive’s web interface is surprisingly hard. You have to upload them, they get converted to Google Suite’s format, and then you have to export them back. Thankfully, Google has an extension specifically designed for viewing and editing Office documents offline — without changing the format. Once you’ve downloaded the Office Editing extension, open a new tab in Chrome, drag the file over to the window, and it will open up. You can end things there; view that Word document and copy the text over if you want. You can also go ahead and start editing the document. The page will prompt you to save the document. Pick a place, give a name and the document with the changes will be saved. The best part is that going forward, all the changes you make will be saved automatically to that file — locally. This seems like a small thing, but it’s a great workflow and opens up a whole new world of seamless Office document editing. Here are a couple of upsides: No need to download and install a third-party app. No need to import or upload the file to your personal Google account. Open Office files and edit without messing with the format. Yes, you’re still using Google’s suite for editing the document which doesn’t have nearly as many features, but as long as you’re doing basic edits, this should be fine.

The first of those will be Canada on June 26th, with Google Assistant seeing a similar launch in both English and French for the device. Nintendo Switch Google Home will be priced at $179.99 CAD ($133.11), just slightly more expensive than the US retail price of $129. All the existing functionality will be available at launch. There is no mention of any of the new significant features announced at I/O, save for Google Assistant in English and French. The latter language is a new addition and lines up with Google’s earlier announcement that Assistant will be adding support for a slew of new languages starting this summer and continuing into the rest of 2017. The last Google product announcement for Canada was the Google Wifi in April, while the country just received Android Pay earlier this week. Google Home is now available for pre-order from the Google Store and Best Buy Canada. On June 26th, Home will also be available from Indigo, London Drugs, Rogers, Staples, The Source, Telus, Visions, and Walmart.

The warning is meant to let websites assess their ads and strip any particularly disruptive ones from their pages. That’s because Chrome’s ad blocker won’t block all ads from the web. Instead, it’ll only block ads on pages that are determined to have too many annoying or intrusive advertisements, like videos that autoplay with sound or interstitials that take up the entire screen. Sridhar Ramaswamy, the executive in charge of Google’s ads, writes in a blog post that even ads “owned or served by Google” will be blocked on pages that don’t meet Chrome’s guidelines. Instead of an ad “blocker,” Google is referring to the feature as an ad “filter,” according to The Wall Street Journal, since it will still allow ads to be displayed on pages that meet the right requirements. The blocker will work on both desktop and mobile. The next big step will be building in an easy-to-use, customizable javascript blocker.

While Google’s crawlers are getting more advanced, they’re still not perfect and sometimes have trouble deciphering information they discover on the Web. This is where schema comes in. Schema.org is a collaboration by the major search engines to create a consistent language that helps them understand entities and their relationship to one another. Structured data is one of the best ways for you to communicate important information about your website to Google. At it’s essence, schema is code typically written in HTML or JSON (I prefer JSON) that helps Google better understand the data on your website. Google has attempted to incentivise the use of schema by displaying rich snippets for domains that use them. These rich snippets are essentially additional text or images that will result in a user being more likely to click on your result. No matter what industry you’re in, you can utilize website schema to help Google better understand your website’s information and improve your SEO. Organization Schema Official Documentation: https://schema.org/Organization Even if you are brand new to the concepts of SEO and structured data as a whole, Organization schema is fairly straightforward and easy to wrap your head around. No matter what industry you belong to, as long as you are a business that sells products or services, Organization schema can be used on your website. So what is Organization schema? Essentially, what this markup will do is signal to Google crucial information about your website. Within this structured data you can include business information such as your name, address, phone number and associated social profiles (Wikipedia, Facebook, Twitter, etc). Organization schema can help your website in a number of ways. It can send clearer information about your business to Google. This is especially crucial for Local SEO where it’s important that your name, address and phone number are consistent across the Web. As well, Organization schema improves your chances of receiving a Knowledge Panel. Here it will be especially important to use same properties to associate your Wikipedia page and social profiles. If you’re nervous about editing the HTML of your website, fear not! I would recommend using a schema generator to get started and then implementing it through Google Tag Manager.   Industry-Specific LocalBusiness Schema Official Documentation: http://schema.org/LocalBusiness For some industries, you can make your structured data a little more specific than the Organization schema above. Instead of simply telling Google: “I am a general organization with the following information”, you can give the search engines more detailed data on what your business does. So what kind of industries have LocalBusiness schema available to them? Doctors? Check Lawyers? Check Insurance Agents? Check Your local mechanic? Check Whatever broad category defines your industry, try Googling “[Your Profession] Schema” and see if any results come back. If you find one that fits your business, you should use that in place of the Organization schema to be more specific. Once again this will help Google get a better understanding of your business. As well, in the future, Google could very well offer some sort of rich snippet for your particular industry. If this occurs, you will be well set up for any algorithm changes that may occur. BreadcrumbList Schema Official Documentation: https://schema.org/BreadcrumbList If you’re not using a breadcrumb on your website, I would recommend you consider doing so. Breadcrumbs can be a great way to improve the user experience of a website as they will allow users to navigate through the different page levels with little effort. As well, they can also improve the internal linking structure which is crucial for better distributing link equity throughout your site. If you’re using a breadcrumb, great! Now it’s time to mark up it up with BreadcrumbList structured data. The BreadcrumbList schema will define each URL in the breadcrumb to Google. This can be beneficial because you can generate a clean looking breadcrumb rich snippet in the search results. More importantly, you will be giving Google detailed information about the structure of your website. This may not have tremendous advantages if you manage a small ten page website. However, if you have a large eCommerce store, this is extremely useful information to pass along. Google’s crawlers often have a difficult time crawling these large websites and they can potentially spend a lot of time looking at pages they shouldn’t. However, by implementing the BreadcrumbList schema, you will be giving Google clear information about the hierarchy of your website. This will give it better guidance on how to crawl and discover the pages on your domain. In my experience, if you can make Google’s job easier, this is likely to have a positive impact on rankings. AggregateRating Schema Official Documentation: http://schema.org/AggregateRating Of all of the structured data on this list, AggregateRating schema probably has the most tangible results. If implemented correctly, this type of structured data rewards websites with bright yellow stars that appear in the search results. The final outcome is that search results that display these stars typically end up with higher click through rates. Higher click through rates obviously leads to more organic traffic. Not surprisingly, this type of schema is extremely popular amongst eCommerce stores as specific product queries typically trigger results with review star rich snippets. For product-centric websites, implementing this type of schema is an absolute must as Google is either already displaying review stars for your target queries or could possibly show them in the future. However, even if your website isn’t eCommerce, it could still be worth exploring the possibility of implementing AggregateRating schema. There are many examples where websites with non-physical products or services could benefit from this structured data. For instance, after performing a search for “laptop insurance” I can see that Google is displaying review star snippets for the query: To find an example of review stars, I had to navigate all the way to the fourth page of the search results. None of the websites on the first page have these review stars displaying. This presents a good opportunity for the company to first implement AggregateRating schema on their landing page. At the end of the day, schema is going to help take your SEO to the next level. As companies invest more and more into in-house and SEO agencies, it’s getting increasingly more difficult to compete in the limited real estate of the organic search results. Implementing good schema will help give your website an additional competitive advantage and can result in Google being more likely to rank your key landing pages.

Email What To Know Before Starting A Blog for Your Business Posted: 06/02/2017 11:37 am EDT Updated: 06/02/2017 11:37 am EDT Cecilie_Arcurs via Getty Images Share Tweet 0 Email Comment tumblr stumble reddit ADVERTISEMENT Many businesses decide that they're going to start a blog. This is great! Or is it? When you choose to blog and do it right, it has the potential to do awesome things for your business. Do it wrong though and you'll be completely wasting your valuable time. A poorly written blog may even cause potential buyers to lose confidence in your business and go elsewhere. This is why adding a blog to your business marketing plan isn't something to do on a whim. It requires some careful thought and consideration. Two Awesome Benefits of Blogging If you're on the fence about blogging for your business, it's important to first look at two of the major benefits of a well done blog. Blogging helps with SEO. Search Engine Optimization is necessary if you have any hope of ranking for anything competitive in Google. And a large aspect of search engine optimization depends on your content being new and fresh. According to accomplished SEO, Jon Doherty, it's a waste of time to be constantly changing the information on your homepage and static webpages, which is why it's best to create a blog. This way, you can publish interesting new content on a regular basis. Having a blog gives you a physical place to put the fresh new content that makes Google happy, rather than coming up with new copy for your homepage and inner pages every other day. That's a pretty big benefit if you consider that websites or blogs that publish new web pages more frequently will most definitely earn higher Google rankings than those who only publish once in awhile or not at all. Some of the other SEO benefits of blogging include; being able to use more keywords, strengthening your inner link structure and gaining (valuable) links from other websites in your industry. As if that weren't enough, there's also another awesome benefit of blogging. Blogging can help with the sales funnel. Want to convert more of your visitors to customers? Of course you do. An active blog can help you do that when you provide information and answers about your products or services to visitors who are in the research phase of the buying process. For example, TrueCoreTX, a Texas fitness studio, uses their blog to promote classes and inform of events that can attract brand new clients for them. "Our market studies have shown us that users want solid information and quick answers to their questions. When a potential new client comes to our blog our goal is to inform them and help them with their decision process." says Lauren Robins, TrueCoreTX marketing strategist. Canadian realtor and SEO expert, Marie Haynes, says she doesn't run a blog, but she does publish new content on her main site via static pages. This year though, her method has shifted from "produce as much content as you can" to "produce only the best content that will actually convert readers into clients". Most SEOs agree that creating high-quality content is the only way to go when it comes to long term online success of a business, for a lot of different reasons. So, think of a blog as another virtual sales tool with the added benefit of increasing your social shares and earning you more links if your content is compelling. Sounds good, right? Except... Writing High-Quality Content Won't Be Easy That's why you can and should learn from businesses that already have great blogs. This includes big brand blogs like Whole Foods who have been blogging since 2006. Also seek out and learn from smaller little known local blogs like Bedford Dental and cool niche blogs like Tropical Laser Alberta. All three blogs give information and answers about their product as well as various relevant topics. It's what ensures people stay intrigued and subscribed. Look at the other blogs within your industry to get ideas too. See who's having success and use them as a guide for your own blog writing. Remember that you don't have to do all of your own blogging either. You can invite guest bloggers to come over and open a dialogue with your audience, or even pay skilled content writers to write your posts. Tip: Try a service like Text Broker or Up Work for hiring experienced writers. And don't give up easily if you don't see immediate results. Jamie Spencer of Make Website Hub, thinks the areas where many businesses fail at blogging is that they "create content that does not help with the buying cycle and often give up too soon as they do not see ROI after a few months." However, if you're not willing to dedicate the time and effort to doing it right, then it's probably best to spare yourself the fail and just not have a business blog at all.

White with red lettering, the shirts put an irreverent spin on “Make America Great Again,” (Gaimari’s version: “Make a Woman Cum for Once,” shown above left) and at $15 each, quickly sold out. Before the March, Gaimari launched an online store for people who didn’t have cash on hand. By the end of the week, she was flooded with hundreds of additional orders. To date, she’s raised over $10,000 for Planned Parenthood, and with the help of a few friends, has hand printed, packed and shipped shirts to every corner of the country.

Less than two weeks after the Women’s March, Gaimari Googled her shop and found it buried under page after page of copycats. Dozens of identical t-shirts, all peddling her design (some with photos stolen from her website, a snap of the shirt on Gaimari’s own body), had relegated her site to the back pages of Google. Despite months of outreach from Gaimari and her social media followers, who have flooded the sites with pleas to remove the shirts or donate the proceeds to charity, they remain at the top of Google today. Gaimari’s isn’t the first slogan to be scooped up by opportunists riding the lucrative wave of the anti-Trump resistance. Google search any of the designs galvanizing women post-election, from the crocheted “pussy hats” thousands wore on January 21 to the inadvertently-uniting “Nevertheless She Persisted,” and you’ll find it trumpeted on a dizzying range of hats, shirts, and other products. Protesting is a prominent part of the zeitgeist, and it follows that people would try to make a buck off it. But this isn’t your run-of-the-mill social movement piggybacking. Like Gaimari’s MAGA takedown, many of the designs fueling the resistance are in aid of Planned Parenthood, the ACLU, and other equal rights groups that need donations now more than ever. Plagiarists aren’t just undermining independent artists; they’re siphoning a steady stream of cash from our most vulnerable populations. “Ultimately, it’s about the donation,” Gaimari says. “We’re losing sales to people who are just trying to profit off of something that’s hot at the moment.” Bootleg resistance gear can be found in all the usual places — Amazon, Etsy, eBay — but the bulk of the merchandise comes from sites like RedBubble, TeeSpring and other “online marketplaces” that let users upload artwork onto t-shirts and sell them en masse. It’s a clever business model that removes the overhead costs that typically plague small businesses, but it also makes plagiarism — and monetizing popular sentiment — really easy. Related: A Day in the Life of a Real Planned Parenthood Employee How People Are Showing Support for Planned Parenthood Trump Just Signed a Bill That Lets States Defund Planned Parenthood “It’s an issue,” says Amanda Brinkman, co-founder of Google Ghost and the designer behind the now-iconic “Nasty Woman” shirt. “Customers don’t understand that business model, and they don’t realize they’re being sold stolen designs.” Brinkman, who donates half of the proceeds of her shirt sales to Planned Parenthood, has raised over $130,000 for the organization as of March — a figure that would be much higher had her design not been repeatedly co-opted by online vendors. Copycat versions of Brinkman’s design are so rampant, she says, that she’s seen targeted ads of these copycat shirts on her own Facebook feed. Brinkman sends legal notices to these sites, she says, but it’s a futile pursuit, adding, “Every notice I send Redbubble to take down a blatant ripoff of my design, 10 new knockoffs show up.” In an email response to questions, Redbubble co-founder and CEO Martin Hosking says the company has a team “dedicated to removing content that is claimed to be infringing and also preventing infringement,” he says. But: “ ... given the scale at which we work, we cannot guarantee that copyright infringement is not committed by a small minority of users.” Most online marketplaces like Redbubble do have user agreements that spell out copyright and intellectual property laws. But since many artists don’t have the time or money it would take to hunt down and sue the rotating cast of people who steal their designs, bad actors often go unpunished. This isn’t a new problem — design theft stems far beyond the resistance, and has long tormented artists who can’t afford to litigate against it. In the age of the meme, where phrases (“Pizza rolls not gender roles”) and quotes (‘They go low, we go high”) are so frequently rehashed, it’s fruitless to try and claim one as your own. Brinkman didn’t coin “Nasty Woman;” that’s our president’s doing. And Gaimari isn’t the first to marry his rhetoric with, um, bodily functions. But make no mistake, the meme-fication of the resistance comes at great expense to everyone involved. Nicole LaRue, the artist behind the official Women’s March logo, which now competes with dozens of plagiarists for search engine space, harbors no illusions to the contrary. “I suspect that when something is great, everyone wants to be a part of that greatness,” she says. “And, sadly, I suspect that some just see it as an easy way to monetize something that has a built-in audience.” For independent artists like LaRue, the mass of business-savvy trolls commodifying their work is deflating, and hard to bounce back from. For the progressive groups that need more than just a catchy slogan to survive the Trump era, it’s eroding a lifeline.

The digital-ad giant's announcement comes as hundreds of millions of internet users have already installed ad blockers on their desktop computers and phones to combat ads that track them and make browsing sites difficult - think pop-up ads. These blockers threaten web publishers that rely on digital ads for revenue.  Google says its Chrome browser will block ads on websites it deems too annoying for web users starting next year., but will allow ads as long as publishers followed guidelines. HOW IT WILL WORK  Google says it will block only 'annoying, intrusive ads on the web--like the kind that blare music unexpectedly, or force you to wait 10 seconds before you can see the content on the page' Is working with the Coalition for Better Ads to decide what will be blocked  Google's version would allow ads as long as publishers followed guidelines that ban certain types of ads that consumers really hate.  That includes pop-up ads, huge ads that don't go away when you scroll down a page and video ads that start playing automatically with the sound on. 'The reality is, it’s far too common that people encounter annoying, intrusive ads on the web - like the kind that blare music unexpectedly, or force you to wait 10 seconds before you can see the content on the page,' said Google's Sridhar Ramaswamy RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Will Apple unveil its iPhone 8 on MONDAY?

MailOnline puts Sony's XB40 to the test Sony SRS-XB40 has a built-in multi-coloured line light, speaker lights and a flashing strobe. It features 24 hours of battery life and claims to be a 'mini-disco on the move'. But does it live up to the claim? Samsung's Galaxy S8: A hefty price tag and a dumb personal assistant Samsung's new Galaxy S8 phone is stunning, but its $100 price hike is hard to swallow.

Google confirms it will start blocking ‘annoying’ ads on Chrome next year A new report will notify publishers when ads on their sites don't meet the Better Ads Standards and enable them to take action before ads are blocked on their sites. Ginny Marvin on June 2, 2017 at 11:48 am More Two years ago, in response to the rise of ad blocking, Google’s head of ads and commerce Sridhar Ramaswamy said the industry needed to come together to tackle the root problem of bad ad experiences. Roughly a year later, Google, Facebook, the IAB and others formed the Coalition for Better Ads to establish global ad standards. In a blog post Thursday, he laid out Google’s plans to support the Coalition for Better Ads standards for digital advertising. Chrome ad blocking Ramaswamy confirmed reports that Chrome will block ads that don’t meet Google’s ad standards (under the guise of the Coalition for Better Ads), starting in early 2018. Critics of the move say it gives Google the power to favor its own ad formats on its own browser and dictate what makes a good ad experience. Ramaswamy is keen to point out that the system will block annoying ads from Google as well (bolding added): “In dialogue with the Coalition and other industry groups, we plan to have Chrome stop showing ads (including those owned or served by Google) on websites that are not compliant with the Better Ads Standards …” The post also concludes with a pledge to work “closely with the entire industry — including groups like the IAB, IAB Europe, the WFA, the ANA and the 4As, advertisers, agencies and publishers — to roll out these changes in a way that makes sense for users and the broader ads ecosystem.” “…there is cause for a healthy dose of skepticism and demand for transparency.” By necessity, any scenario for global improvement in digital ad experiences has to include the biggest ad seller in the world. And as such, Google has to take a leadership role in these efforts. Still, when that same company also controls the world’s most popular web browser from which users access publisher’s websites, there is cause for a healthy dose of skepticism and demand for transparency. Ad Experience Report To give publishers insights into whether ads are being blocked on their sites when viewed via Chrome after this move goes into effect next year, Google has created a new reporting system. A new Ad Experience Report will show publishers screen shots of display ads or videos of any ad experiences that Google’s system detects “are likely to annoy your users” and violate the Better Ads Standards on desktop or mobile. If a publisher’s site is deemed to not be meeting the standards, Google will send a warning at least 30 days before ad blocking begins. Publishers can fix the detected issues and resubmit their sites for review within that time frame to avoid having their ads blocked on Chrome. Funding Choices beta Google is also running a beta with publishers in North America, the UK, Germany, Australia and New Zealand to serve a message to visitors using ad blockers that gives them the choice of either overriding the ad blocker and enabling ads on the site or paying to view the site without ads. The payment occurs via Google Contributor, which Google began testing as a paywall alternative in 2014. Google says Funding Choices will roll out to more countries later this year.

But images that are too large, too numerous and unnecessary simply slow down page load times and get in the way of the users reading and doing what they need to do. The problem: the size of webpages sent to mobile phones has quadrupled in just five years. The main cause: images, which account for 68% of total page weight. With mobile page speed a confirmed ranking factor in Google’s last mobile-friendly update, and Google’s mobile-first index looming large on the horizon, it’s in the interests of developers and SEOs to optimize their mobile site speed as much as possible. That means figuring out how to trim the fat from all those huge, cumbersome images. This column will explore the issue and causes of delays in mobile page speed (i.e. how quickly pages load on a mobile device) and how to test webpages for problems with speed. The next column will look at methods to reduce the impact of images on the performance of your mobile pages. This includes only using images that add value and making the images you do use work harder, with an excellent case study from Unilever. This data was sourced from the incredibly useful httpArchive, which tests the top 1 million sites several times every month: The average transfer size (i.e. bites sent from server to device) of a webpage is 4.2 times larger than it was five years ago, rising from 521 Kilobyte (KB) in December 2011 to 2197KB or 2.197 megabyte (MB) in December 2016. N.B.: this measures compressed rather than original file sizes. Images are a massive amount of that bloat. Total size of images sent to mobile devices has increased 4.2 times from 352KB in 2011 to 1490KB in 2016. Image requests have grown from 38 to 50. JPEGs are most common, accounting for 46% of image requests. By comparison, the other major contributor to page bloat is JavaScript, which has risen from 98KB to 381KB with requests rising from 8 to 21 requests. That’s 17% of total page size compared to images’ 68%. The one to watch is video, which was nonexistent in 2011 websites, but now averages 110KB or 5% of total page size and takes up a gigantic 542KB per request vs 43KB for a JPEG. The most shocking discovery here is that the average size of a mobile webpage, 2197KB (2.2MB) is almost as large as the average desktop webpage at 2469 KB (2.5MB) in November 2016. We can only surmise why this might be: Are responsive design websites… or to be more precise inefficiently built/implemented responsive design sites to blame (because the true responsive design website is one site reformatted for different devices)? Has the adoption of lazy and deferred loading techniques encouraged companies to be less efficient with total page size? Putting things right A note before we begin: Web/mobile images are an imprecise science. There are no hard and fast rules – different practitioners and scenarios dictate differing course of action. There is no best format, size, content type, design, shape, placement or number of images, but there are best practices to help you make those decisions. The rule of thumb is as small, as few, as big an impact as necessary. “Images” are not just illustrative pictures or graphs. They also include logos and icons – but these do not necessarily need to be traditional images, such as JPEGs. Action plan: Review your policy on images, or create one, if you don’t have one. Issue guidelines for all web content creators as well as developers. Audit the images you are using on the site. Are they adding or taking away from user experience? Can they be improved, optimized, reduced in size (on page), pushed below the fold or removed? Test how effective your images are with the users. Research/test before you make any changes, test as you pilot changes and monitor results after changing. Work out how you will balance page speed with attractiveness, quality, impact, page speed, efficiency and accessibility. The need for speed Robert Gaines, a Kansas, US-based, web and app developer: Graphics are attractive and allow users to quickly grasp concepts without reading large amounts of text, however they also slow load times. Excessive use of images or the use of especially large images will slow down webpages. Slow load times annoy both readers and search engines. The need for graphics has to be balanced against page speed. When images are used, they should be compressed and scaled so that they load more quickly. In cases where compression and scaling aren’t enough, other advanced techniques may be needed. There is no rule for perfect speeds that a page should download to a mobile device, how could there be – mobile connections vary massively. The rule of thumb is as fast as possible. Benchmark your performance against competitors and sector leaders. Various studies and reports, see WPO Stats for examples, have shown that improving page speed improves conversions. For example, an FT.com study found that reducing page load by 3 second on mobile led to a 9% reduction in articles read over the month. Google warns on its TestMySite tool that “Nearly half of all visitors will leave a mobile site if the pages don’t load within 3 seconds.” But the source of this stats is unclear.

Test, test, test Testing is critical improving to website performance and usability. 1. Test how quickly pages download Regularly test your mobile webpages (all new ones and all the main ones). Use different services and at different times, because tests results will differ… a lot. WebPageTest is one of the better ones, it measures speed, page size and shows what proportion of the data and requests belong to images, JavaScript etc. Some of it is a bit techie, but the excellent filmstrip showing how the site loads second by second can be understood by everyone. WebPageTest used to offer remedies also, but sadly these have disappeared. For something less techie, use Google’s PageSpeed Insights (also try the simplified version: TestMySite – it sometimes surprises by offering a different results to its brother). N.B. Google doesn’t actually test page speed, it estimates page speed based on key criteria, but it is excellent at pointing out problems with the page. Top issues identified by Google include problems with image size and JavaScript codes, which we know from the httpArchive’s data are the two largest contributors to data bloat. httpArchive is different. It tests the home pages of the top 1 million websites, at regular times each month. It is based on WebPageTest. It’s brilliant for showing the breakdown of content types e.g. images and shows historical trends. Even if you are not in the top 1 million you can use it to benchmark against the big boys: individuals, top 100, top 1000, top 1 million. For this random test, let’s pretend we are the biggest retailer in the world, and compare against the biggest online retailer: Mobile speed test performance test for Walmart.com: httpArchive – mobile page speed (January 15, 2017): 20.6 seconds. Page weight: 1941KB. 95 requests. Images: 962KB. Image requests 53. WebPageTest (tested on a US-based iPhone6, cable connection, (9.00 GMT, 29-01-17) – mobile page speed: 14.3 seconds; fully loaded 17.9 seconds. PageSpeed Insights – mobile speed score: 45/100 (poor). Google should fix list: Optimize images. Eliminate render-blocking JavaScript and CSS in above-the-fold content. It is important to benchmark your performance against your competitors’ sites, so let’s try Amazon.com: httpArchive – speed (January 15, 2017): 6.9 seconds. Weight: 554KB. 89 requests. Images: 259KB. Image requests 49. WebPageTest – speed (9.00 GMT, 29-01-17): 2.4 seconds; fully loaded 4.8 seconds. PageSpeed Insights – mobile speed score: 55/100 (poor). Google should fix list: Eliminate render-blocking JavaScript and CSS in above-the-fold content. Google PageSpeed, pictured in the image below, estimates that Walmart could save 478KB (almost 0.5MB) simply by compressing the images on the page. As can be seen from the httpActive chart, this could save as much as half the image weight or one quarter of total page size. See Google’s Guidelines for optimizing images and fixing JavaScript issues. 2. Conduct user testing As with all aspects of web development, user testing is critical to improving site performance and usability. Conduct surveys and interviews with users to discover how they use your site and any pain points with the experience. Test and watch users as they interact with the website. Use eye tracking to see what catches their attention and which images work. Use heatmaps and web analytics to track how users interact with webpages and where they look. 3. A/B test webpages with different images, numbers, placement, formats and sizes of images A/B testing shows two different versions of the webpage to different groups of visitors. Compare the results to see which types of image work best. As we will see in the next column when we look at Unilever’s work with mobile images, user testing your mobile website is hugely important, and small changes to images can deliver big differences.   This article is Part 1 of a three-part series on how to optimize your mobile site speed.

[Update: Site is live, more details] Google launches Funding Choices, a way for users to pay sites to hide ads Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/06/01 8:01pm PDTJun 1, 2017 54 Plus 1 on G+ 126 Share on Facebook 77 Share on Twitter Total Shares257 Games News Update 1: 2017/06/01 8:01pm PDT The new site for Google Contributor/Funding Choices is live, and offers some new insight into how the service actually works. According to the signup page, each page without ads You may recall Google Contributor, which was a service by Google that allowed users to pay a monthly contribution to see fewer ads online. Your money would directly substitute the money earned by the site for advertisements. Contributor was discontinued in late 2016, with Google saying that an improved version would become available in "early 2017." Today, the company launched Funding Choices, the successor to Contributor. Currently in beta, it allows sites to show a customized message to visitors using an ad blocker. The message asks users to either enable ads for the site, or pay for a pass through Contributor that removes all ads on that site. Unlike the original Contributor, Funding Choices hides more than just AdSense ads If you're reading this and thinking, "I really wish Android Police would do this," then you're in luck. We've been part of Google's internal beta, but we're not quite ready to roll it out. Just know that we are definitely working on it. The new Contributor site doesn't seem to be live yet, but there will likely be more details there soon. Source: Google Update 1: 2017/06/01 8:01pm PDT The new site for Google Contributor/Funding Choices is live, and offers some new insight into how the service actually works. According to the signup page, each page without ads that you view on a site costs a small amount, with publishers apparently able to change the price (most of them seem to use $0.01 per page right now). So assuming $0.01 per page, $1 gets you 100 pages without ads, and Google is offering a $5 pass to start out with. Not bad pricing at all, as long as sites stay around the $0.01 price point. Google also offers a list of sites supporting Google Contributor, which currently includes Beliefnet, Business Insider UK, ComicBook, Eurogamer, Grub Street, Hot Air, Parkers, Patheos, Popular Mechanics, Townhall, Twitchy, and World Wide Gaming.

NexusPhan The ads in AP are not bad. Very reasonable and not intrusive at all. I have this site whitelisted to help support their great work. You should consider it too before funding choices goes live. MJ There is certainly websites with much more obnoxious ads but their is a lot of ads on AP. It's just not an acceptable user experience and I not going to subject myself to it. I have been calling for a way to donate to AP for awhile now (why did AP have to wait for a Google solution?) so we see how this plays out. Zachary Dunn Ecommerce is hard. Most small outlets like AP prefer a platform that can handle the security and financial liability. MJ I am not talking about ecommerce but making donations. LOL Alex Dueppen Unfortunately Disqus hasn't been the same way, it seems to often load ads that redirect you to those scam "You are winner" pages that try to look like facebook.

Maxr1998 I hope these cancerous, unblockable Outbrain ads will also be a part of the funding choices, then I'll happily pay - not that I wouldn't contribute anyway, because I feel a bit guilty for blocking ads for a long time already.. Eli Stevens I do the job from comfort and ease of my residence, participating in effortless activities that just require from you a Laptop together with internet access and I am just pleased than ever... After 6 months in this job and therefore managed to get remunerated in whole 36,000 usd... Mainly I get approximately 80 bucks/h and work for 3 to 4 hours constantly.And magnificent factor with this job is the fact that you can supervise time when you do the job and for just how long as you wish for and you attain a check week by week.>>>> learn by clicking here how to do it right now needa I use adguard. No outbrain. Just an empty spot above the comments section with sponsored content in one corner and recommended by Outbrain in another. Maxr1998 Hm, interesting. I'm using adaway, maybe I need to tweak my filter lists a little then.. NeverrKnowsBest I have gotten full screen malware ads from AP before. I did not want to block them, but they forced my hand. NexusPhan They did have a bad streak of ads for a while about a year ago. I remember that now that you say it. I enabled ad blocker for a few months after it happened. Corbin Davenport I will say that those are normally from Disqus, and we've worked with Disqus in the past to identify them and get them removed. ZettabyteGamer I'm sure it would be hard but if disqus is causing so many problems, maybe you should switch to a different comment section or make your own? needa They would just have to throw more ads up themselves to pay for it. Disqus is pretty good anyways. Not to mention Disqus is a way to get new people to come back to your site. Meaning some guy that already has a disqus acct, but found the site because he needs a new phone, can instantly comment without having to sign up for another account at another site. needa I never thought about Disqus throwing in ads. Sort of makes me feel like an idiot for not seeing what is right in front of me. Now it all makes sense. Thanks. Marcelove Would you work to remove the Outbrain and Taboola cancer networks too? Keep any of those at AP makes any other changes useless... tnt How can you tell what is from Disqus vs the site? Justin W I'd agree that AP's ads aren't bad, but Disqus's are terrible. Irwin LOL are you seriuos? on mobile, like half the site is all ads. It's ridiculous. blueman24 I'm ok with whitelist for sites like AP on desktop but on mobile, I don't want any ads. AP can add 5 more ads on their desktop site but don't cripple performance on my already slow phone. Marcelove Never while it still use Taboola or Outbrain as ads delivers... Both are cancers and any site promoting them shall stay adblocked... No matter how much I like a site, or as good it is, if it decides to use those networks... Doing that equals being automatically added and never removed from my blacklist and everyone should do that to enforce it is unacceptable... tnt I'm with you 100%. They're pure trash. Add Revcontent in there as well. wow Why are they "cancers"? I mean, from what I see outbrain ads are trashy and slow but I don't understand why that's an automatic blacklist for a site that provides quality content for free. Do they have malware or something? (This is referring to those fake news ads above the comment section, right?) EcE APK Mirror - - I do not feel guilty and will happily wait my 10 seconds rather than see 200 ads per page and pop ups (or whatever they are called which are basically the same) whenever I need an APK. Rashad Would it be a one time cost or is this a cost each time we visit a participating site? Corbin Davenport I believe it's a monthly subscription, just like the previous Contributor. MJ Questions? Why did AP have to wait for a Google solution? There are many ways you could have been collecting money all this time. A automatic monthly subscription? Sounds like a loser already as people hate that. It's not going to be a set amount but like pick an amount right? An annual subscription would make more sense. Why can't there just be a simple donate button so people could send money when they can and just continuing blocking the ads ourselves like we have been already doing? Cai Copley It's that you do it in one, centralized location for such a subscription, and not doing it over a series of sites and forgetting how much you're spending. MJ I guess need more details on how it works... Jeff Beck We'll have a special rate for you MJ. .005 cents per article, $15 per grumpy comment submitted. We are going to make a fortune off you ;) Maxr1998 Starting the day with a smile thanks to your witty comments. Thanks Jeff! :D George https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4ba5750c423a92daff44db461bb3042c433e0f5e7edc1f8dadcb32198db0d5e8.jpg Artem Russakovskii It's almost here. Just finishing final testing. Mark Curtis Or just block ads and not pay! I'm entitled to free content! gimme gimme gimme. faceless128 it's about safety. there are so many malicious advertisements out there. if a site doesn't directly control the ads that show up, how can they ensure our safety? Camerooni I use privacy badger.. if it blocks ads that play bad - I'm okay with that alongside blocking tracking cookies etc. What I don't like is sites assuming that if you're blocking an ad network that plays bad with you that you're the bad guy.. Things have to work both ways. Mark Curtis AdBlocking started way back when they were simple JPGs with no JavaScript at all. It could even go back to that and people would complain about having to download the bytes. Ailín Ó’S I wonder will this work internationally or just USA only because I use adblock and don't have AP (for example) whitelisted because of the sheer volume of ads on the site especially from the likes of Disqus with their "Congrats! You're a winner!" and "Local man makes 999.999€ a day with this trick!" spam. cadtek91 I'd imagine it would work with anyone with a Google account? Fabrice Thomas Seems like it's only available in these contries: US, Germany, New Zealand and UK https://support.google.com/contributor/answer/6182581?hl=en Jeff Beck If you want to just pay me directly I'll give you my PayPal address. That'll make things even easier on you. I know, I'm way too nice to you all, you're welcome. DavidW dogecoins or gtfo TechGuy22 Thanks but I'll stick adblock and adaway needa If you guys are wanting input, which I know you didn't ask for, five bucks a year would be my max. Not sure how it works, but I would want that on my mobile device. Desktop chrome has what I need in an extension. Ultimately that would earn more money from me, as i get on this sight far less with mobile chrome. Good_Ole_Pinocchio 5 bucks a year? What does that Pay for? Beer for the staff? needa If everyone that comes to this site with adblock paid five bucks, I doubt they would complain. Jeffrey Spiers Brave browser has this built into the browser directly, have used the feature on some of my most frequented sites. Switched to Brave due to many sites detecting and bitching about ad blockers recently. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Web Ads are trash, always. But I've never used ad blockers. Because if I'm taking the content, I'm taking the ads, or I just don't go to the site if the ads are really horrible. I'd more than pay for no ads. psy spy You have to sign in to your gmail account for this to work? Easier to track us. _jack_ It would be nicer to have this from another company, yes. I also wonder, how much Google keeps for themselves? Godspoken Would there even be a difference between you being signed in to your Google account with this vs without? You're using Android and Google services, I don't know what you'd expect. abc I don't browse from my phone so I'm rarely signed into Google, and this will blow some people's minds on this site - but some of us only use two or three Google apps/services, not the whole damn suite. Lord Argyris The official blurb is a little vague. Each time I visit a page without ads, my pass/account/whatever has the site's chosen cost deducted from it. What constitutes a "page"? If I refresh the tab, does that count as an additional page load? What if I visit an article again at a later date? What about those obnoxious sites that have an automatic reload timer? Could they game FC users? I'm sure all these questions will be answered in time. What I would have liked to have seen is some sort of a multiple tier system, whereby I can select specific participants (e.g AP) and offer to pay a flat monthly rate rather than a per-page fee, then leave the normal fee structure in place for others. It would be an easy way to donate more than I would ordinarily accumulate to places I come frequently, without forcing said sites to set up their own donation system. No matter what tier FC visitors choose, the site gets money. FelschR It's stated quite clearly: "Note: you are charged each time you visit or refresh a page, even if you have previously visited it." https://support.google.com/contributor/answer/7359560?hl=en&ref_topic=6182570 Lord Argyris Okay, that answers that. The blurb on the page linked in the article lacked that more detailed information. Matías Duarte I've only used AdBlock for AP the moment that those ads magically opened a new popup while scrolling without even touching them. Now that the annoying problem is gone, I've disabled it. I know no one cares about this but I finally got accepted for a job and I'll get my very first payment tomorrow, so I would happily pay a contribution for this page! Jeff Beck I'll be one to care. Congrats! Getting paid is awesome. At least that's what the other writers at AP tell me. Kostas 💪🎩 😂😂😂😂😂😂 imneveral0ne I just had a you're a winner one pop up on my phone with android police, so it's definitely not gone. ZettabyteGamer How long till I can use this with you guys? I'm itching to try it out, but this is the only site I really read everyday. Necdet Ali Özdür I think the real question here is what Google means by "fewer ads". Are all kinds of ads will be blocked or just intrusive ones? Will the trackers also be removed? someone755 Hmmm... https://youtu.be/4ezd24krgiQ Powsniffer0110 I'd be happy to pay 1¢ an article on AP and Phandroid, XDA ect.! Powsniffer0110 This is funny as hell lol. We're now paying Google to NOT give us ads... Haha. YaKillaCJ Or continue using AdAway, uBlock Origins and DNS Host Blocking via my router. Many can say what they want but my stance is simple. I won't pay just to "not be inconvenienced and intrused on". Any dev, content providers or ect can easily find many non intrusive ways to advertise. Just_No_Stop This whole situation could have been avoided if ads weren't so intrusive, ugly, malicious, irrelevant and numerous. Some pages use less than a tenth of the data with ads blocked, which is crazy, and any ad that slows the delivery of content is unacceptable. It still baffles me how such appalling ads can be effective, if they piss you off why would you then want the product? Paying not to have to put up with such things is not on, I will keep blocking until sites have better ad policies. dancedar1 'Google offering a $5 pass' reads as though they are giving you $5 credit to try it out - they're not; it's £/$5 minimum mattcoz I also read it that way. 4Ui812 1 cent per page isn't a sustainable business model once users realize how much money they'll blow through. Sites that depend on advertising would be better served by using some sort of royalties model like the way radio stations do with music and artists/labels. Otherwise ad blockers are here to stay.Of course Google will want they're cut. 4Ui812 I'd be willing to turn off my ad blocker and sign up Google Contributor/Funding Choices for the free $5 and then I'd blow it all on this site so you guys and gals can have the money. Once it's gone though my ad blocker will be turned back on :-) Ad blocker is used for security reasons. tmartin Will it remove that Outbrain chum? I really need that stuff to go away. needa I use adguard and there is not one single avertisement on this page. There is a spot for outbrain, but no ads. tmartin I use Ghostery mostly because of the chum and that takes care of it, but I wouldn't mind supporting AP. needa I wouldn't mind either. I turn my blocker off periodically to help out. From the looks of it Google will have the answers we need soon enough with their new chrome filter that they are working on. Hopefully then we will be able to support our favorite sites without being slowed down by the ads. Marcelove Wall Street Journal will use it or it will keep that aggressive paywall? Because allowing only 10 articles is like grabbing the print version, take only one sheet and give to someone saying "If you wanna read more than 1 sheet per month, you need to pay us". I'm not against a publisher using a paywall, but the restriction here is so absurd that even if I was 100% determined to subscribe, I wouldn't only because at this example the newspaper is being douchebag... 30 articles, or 1 per day, would really mean that it was caring about itself and the public... But only 10 shows that it don't give a f*ck about the public and is only caring about itself... Anthony Castanza This is a substantial regression from the old version. Morten Ulv How did the old one work? rap 1¢ per page would add up very fast. By the time I read a couple of favorite blogs each day that would be $20 per month. jdrch $0.01 per page sounds doable. Lars Jeppesen Not available in my countries... Gen. Chang The point is to force the ad industry and websites to change the way they operate. Not reward them for more bad behavior. If it was not for the privacy intrusive models they use, there would not be as big a problem.

Fleet Owner | Jun 02, 2017 Waymo, the company spun-off by Google that has been developing autonomous-driving technology, confirmed it is testing a self-driving truck.  The story was first reported by BuzzFeed on June 1.  “Self-driving technology can transport people and things much more safely than we do today and reduce the thousands of trucking-related deaths each year. We’re taking our eight years of experience in building self-driving hardware and software and conducting a technical exploration into how our technology can integrate into a truck," a Waymo spokesperson said in a statement. The company told Forbes it is testing a single Peterbilt truck at its private track in California. Waymo hopes to conduct road tests in Arizona later this year.  The company said it has conducted more than three million miles of on-road testing of autonomous cars. This news comes days after Uber announced it fired Anthony Levandowski, the founder of Otto and former Google employee accused of stealing confidential files and trade secrets.  This story originally appeared at Fleet Owner 0 comments Hide comments Comment * More information about text formats Text format CommentsPlain text Comments Allowed HTML tags: <em> <strong> <blockquote> <br> <p> Plain text No HTML tags allowed.

This includes devices from a bunch of different manufacturers – everything from BlackBerry to Vivo. Samsung has a bunch in there, as does General Mobile and Google (with its Pixel and Nexus devices). I and we recommend that every device on this list should be checked immediately to make certain these security updates have been downloaded – that means, you, Janice from accounting! First, before we go deep into the program that allows this set of updates to be possible in their current state: the devices must be listed! The list of devices shown here comes direct from Google and spans updates through the past couple of months. Devices on this list should absolutely be updated as soon as possible – we’ll go through the simple check process, too. Android devices with Security Updates to check: • BlackBerry: Priv • Fujitsu: F-01J • General Mobile: GM5 Plus d, GM5 Plus, General Mobile 4G Dual, General Mobile 4G • Gionee: A1 • Google: Pixel XL, Pixel, Nexus 6P, Nexus 6, Nexus 5X, Nexus 9 • LG: LG G6, V20, Stylo 2 V, GPAD 7.0 LTE • Motorola: Moto Z, Moto Z Droid • Oppo: CPH1613, CPH1605 • Samsung: Galaxy S8 Plus, Galaxy S8, Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 Edge, Galaxy S7 Active, Galaxy S6 Active, Galaxy S5 Dual SIM, Galaxy C9 Pro, Galaxy C7, Galaxy J7, Galaxy On7 Pro, Galaxy J2, Galaxy A8, Galaxy Tab S2 9.7 • Sharp: Android One S1, 507SH • Sony: Xperia XA1, Xperia X • Vivo: Vivo 1609, Vivo 1601, Vivo Y55 Android Users Security Update Check: 1. Tap Settings 2. Tap System Update 3. Tap Download and/or Update OR 1. Tap Settings 2. Tap About Phone or About Tablet 3. Tap System Updates 4. Tap Download and/or Update Thanks to a program launched by Google to get hackers and developers in on the security game, a bunch of security updates are coming in fast and heavy to Android devices. According to the Android Developers blog, this Android Security Rewards program has reached a fever pitch after being launched two years ago. Mayank Jain and Scott Roberts of the Android Security team suggest that the biggest rewards for finding vulnerabilities in Android have not yet seen payout. This means that while 450 qualifying vulnerability reports have been filed in the second year of Android Security Rewards being live, and pay per researcher jumped by 52.3%, there’s a bunch more cash out there to grab. Jain and Roberts suggested this week that over $1.5 million dollars have been sent to researchers (hackers and developers) in the Android Security Rewards program. For developers that wish to get paid monstrous amounts of dollars to do what they do best, head over to Google Application Security to join in on the action. This is a program that is ongoing, and not restricted to “professional” security researchers. OF NOTE: It might seem strange that this program only currently covers three devices: Pixel, Pixel XL, and Pixel C, but that’s been the case since the beginning. Back when this program was launched, it covered just the Nexus 6 and Nexus 9. Using these most base of Android devices as templates, Google is able to spread the security around to the rest of the Android universe.

gizmodo Deadspin Fusion Gizmodo Jalopnik Jezebel Kotaku Lifehacker The Root Video Sploid Paleofuture io9 Science Reviews Field Guide What to Expect From Apple WWDC 2017: iOS, Siri Speaker, MacBooks, and More Michael NunezFriday 11:00am Filed to: Apple WWDC WWDC 2017 MacBook MacBook Air iOS 11 macOS Siri 32 Edit Promote Share to Kinja Toggle Conversation tools Go to permalink Image: Apple On Monday, Apple’s annual developer conference, WWDC, kicks off, and that means we will soon learn more about the company’s newest and most exciting products. This year, the event runs from June 5-June 9 and is expected to serve as the launching point for major updates to iOS and macOS, as well as some new hardware. This will be the first time in roughly 15 years that Apple will not be hosting the event at the Moscone West Convention Center in San Francisco. Instead, the event will take place at the McEnery Convention Center in San Jose. We’ll be on the ground at the conference, so be sure to check back for our coverage beginning Monday morning. There’s plenty to be excited about this year, so let’s dive right in. A new iPad Pro Image: Gizmodo / Alex Cranz WWDC is typically centered around software like iOS and macOS, but this year we’re expecting some hardware too. The extremely credible KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says there’s a good chance Apple will announce a new iPad Pro at this year’s conference. Advertisement The new iPad Pro is rumored to have a 10.5-inch screen that will fit comfortably between the existing 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch models. It will also reportedly feature a new design with slimmer bezels. There’s no indication of exactly how much the new device will cost—but there’s a very good chance it will be priced similarly to existing models (starting at about $600). Siri speaker Image: Apple The new iPad Pro isn’t the only piece of hardware expected to debut at the conference. Kuo also predicts that Apple is planning to launch a smart speaker to compete with the Amazon Echo and Google Home. In a research note viewed by MacRumors, Kuo reportedly said there is “over [a] 50 percent chance” that Apple will announce its new smart home speaker and begin selling them later in the year. Kuo said the speaker will likely produce excellent sound quality and will positioned for a higher end market (i.e. it will be more expensive) than the Amazon Echo. Adding to swirling rumors, the extremely credible Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman reported this week that Apple “started manufacturing a long-in-the-works Siri-controlled smart speaker.” Gurman reports that the speaker will differ from the Amazon Echo and Google home by offering virtual surround sound technology and deep integration into Apple products. The speaker will essentially serve as a hub to automate smart home devices through Apple’s (currently underdeveloped) HomeKit platform. It will also help lock customers into Apple’s walled garden as people begin to add more automation to their homes and subscribe to services like Apple Music. Gurman also reports that the speaker will have advanced acoustics that give it an edge over competing products like the Echo and Google Home and that Apple considered adding virtual surround sound technology similar to Sonos Trueplay. It will also have comparable hardware to the Sonos Play:5 according to Kuo’s research note, which says the speaker will have one subwoofer, seven tweeters, and computing power similar to the iPhone 6/6S. By comparison, as Mac Observer points out, the Echo only has one woofer and one tweeter. The Sonos Play:5 only has three woofers and three tweeters. In short, the soon-to-be-announced Siri speaker sounds much more powerful than Google Home or Amazon Echo. New MacBook and MacBook Pros Image: Gizmodo / Alex Cranz It looks all-but-certain that we’ll be getting a new MacBook lineup at the conference. French website Consomac is reporting that it found a Russian-language regulatory filing in the Eurasian Economic Commission database that points to at least five new models running macOS Sierra launching soon. Advertisement Sponsored In addition to the filing, Bloomberg reports Apple will be releasing a new MacBook lineup to stave off competition from Microsoft’s striking new Surface Laptop. The new MacBook Pro will get a bump to the latest seventh-generation Intel Core processors, giving it a significant hardware boost. One of the more remarkable rumors is that Apple could revive the 12-inch and 13-inch MacBook Airs by giving them a nice hardware bump, according to Bloomberg. Analysts aren’t expecting any major design changes to either the MacBook or MacBook Pro, but say the new MacBook Air could have a new look. Advertisement John Gruber reported in April that Apple is working hard on a “completely rethought” Mac Pro with a modular design. The new design is supposed to accommodate high-end CPUs and GPUs, and make it easier for people to update the computer with new components on a regular basis. The company is also working on pro displays to ship with the new desktops. Unfortunately, Gruber reports that the next-gen Mac Pros “will not ship this year,” meaning they likely will not make an appearance at WWDC. A first look at iOS 11 Image: Gizmodo Don’t get your hopes up for new iPhone models. They probably aren’t coming until later this year. What you can expect at WWDC, though, is a big focus on Apple’s new mobile operating system, iOS 11. We don’t know much about the OS ahead of the show, but we’re expecting a bunch of updates that focus on artificial intelligence. A sketchy rumor from Israeli publication the Verifier suggests that Siri will add contextual learning and better integration into Apple services like iMessage and iCloud. Advertisement Other updates to the operating system, according to 9to5Mac, could include features like group FaceTime, meaning that you’ll be able to video conference multiple people from your phone. There’s also a rumor that iMessage will add multi-person calls, making it easier to have up to five people join a single call. The most dramatic changes will be specifically tailored to the iPad. 9to5Mac reports that things like multi-user login to be added to the operating system while other blogs like MacRumors suggest Apple is working on expanded Apple Pencil support for the iPad Pro. Updates to macOS, WatchOS, and tvOS Last year, Apple decided to drop the “X” from its desktop operating system’s name, instead calling it simply macOS. As part of the update, Apple started integrating even more iOS features into the desktop with things like Siri for Mac and Apple Pay for the web. Advertisement Advertisement This year, we’re expecting to see the second iteration of macOS (10.13), but there aren’t any hard details about what exactly. We should also see updates to other operating systems including WatchOS for the Apple Watch and tvOS for the Apple TV, according to the Telegraph. This essentially means that every operating system in the Apple ecosystem will receive a significant update, and that seems like a reasonable expectation considering the event is specifically tailored to get developers excited about building apps for Apple products. As always, we’ll be covering the conference as news breaks, so be sure to check back here June 5-June 9 for more info about the latest updates, and we’ll keep updating this story as more information becomes available.

Just ask, and Google’s algorithm will do the rest. by Tom Simonite June 2, 2017 In Google’s commercial for its virtual assistant, people ask it to play dance music, videos, and set a timer. A new feature from the search giant that lets you ask questions of its online spreadsheets is less flashy, but it could be the start of something that has a huge impact on how some companies operate. Recommended for You Secret Algorithms Threaten the Rule of Law Experts Predict When Artificial Intelligence Will Exceed Human Performance Trump Misused MIT Research in Reasons for Ditching Climate Deal You Don’t Have to Major in Computer Science to Do It as a Career The Cryptocurrency Market Is Growing Exponentially Instead of creating charts from data the way office drones have done it for decades, you can now simply ask for what you want—for example by typing “histogram of 2017 ice cream sales.” Google’s machine-learning algorithms do the rest. The new feature joins one introduced last year called Explore that allows you to type phrases such as “what are average sales on Sundays” instead of creating formulas. Together they are an example of advances in machine learning that are transforming office work and the economy. How exactly those advances are changing the job market is subject to some debate. Some predictions have it that machine learning has become so capable, and is improving so quickly, that it won’t be long before many jobs, such as driving trucks, are completely eliminated. A milder view suggests that jobs will be radically changed, but not eradicated, as software takes over certain tasks. A study from McKinsey published in January predicted that half of today’s workplace tasks could be automated by 2055—but that only 5 percent of jobs would no longer need humans at all.

Arguing that features powered by machine learning make its customers more productive has become a core part of the company’s effort to win market share away from Microsoft. Not even Google can have much idea of how companies will use the time saved using its new feature. In a large company, it might be enough to shrink a team of analysts, or avoid expanding it. Or it might free those already on staff to do deeper explorations that have a bigger impact on the bottom line. What seems more certain given the many limitations of today’s machine-learning technology is that spreadsheets themselves will be here for a good while longer. Automating the act of making a chart out of data in neatly labeled columns is one thing. Creating a machine that can generate the kinds of questions and ideas that we need charts to answer and explore is quite another.

Made with Code is an initiative from Google, launched in 2014, that empowers teenage girls to code. This new partnership allows users to code in three different levels that recreate scenes from Wonder Woman – which hits theatres today. The scenes in Made with Code introduce the user to coding by providing blocks that need dragging and dropping into the right place to make Wonder Woman, as well as variables and other objects, move in the right sequence for the scene to play out correctly. After the user has successfully completed a level, they're treated to the scene playing out in full. Related: Injustice 2 review The aim of the initiative is to teach teenage girls how important coding is in animating a series of events. Google previously partnered with the film Inside Out to bring a similar set of new levels to their Made with Code programme.

The digital-ad giant's announcement comes as hundreds of millions of internet users have already installed ad blockers on their desktop computers and phones to combat ads that track them and make browsing sites difficult. These blockers threaten websites that rely on digital ads for revenue. Google's version will allow ads as long as websites follow industry-created guidelines and minimize certain types of ads that consumers really hate. That includes pop-up ads, huge ads that don't go away when visitors scroll down a page and video ads that start playing automatically with the sound on. Google says the feature will be turned on by default, and users can turn it off. It'll work on both the desktop and mobile versions of Chrome. Google says that even ads it sells will be blocked on websites that don't get rid of annoying types of ads. But there might not be vast changes online triggered by the popular browser's efforts. It's a "small number of websites that are disproportionately responsible for annoying user experiences," Google spokeswoman Suzanne Blackburn said. "I'm sure there are some publishers who will get hurt," said Brian Wieser, an ad analyst with Pivotal Research Group. But in the long term, he says, cracking down on irritating ads should make the internet experience better, encouraging people to visit sites and click on links. That, in turn, benefits Google. The company is also starting a program that could help publishers deal with users who have downloaded popular ad blockers. Some individual websites have come up with their own countermeasures. Forbes.com, for example, won't let you read stories without disabling your ad blocker or logging in with Facebook or Google accounts, so the site can track you. Google would work with websites to set up messages telling users to disable their blockers for the site or pay for a version of it with no ads. It'll take a 10 percent cut of those payments. To protect its ad business, Google has tried to improve user experiences in other ways. It launched a way for websites to load faster on phones. And it used its sway as the dominant search engine to push companies to make their sites mobile-friendly. Such sites show up higher in mobile searches. Google also has tried to address advertisers' concerns about their ads running next to offensive content by banning its ads from some objectionable videos on YouTube, like those that promote discrimination or advocate illegal drug use. Google also won't place its ads on web pages with objectionable content - porn, for example, and or sites that promote suicide or violence. Facebook, too, is trying to make links from inside its universe less spammy for users. It says it's trying to cut down on posts and ads in the news feed that lead to junky pages with "little substantive content" and "disruptive, shocking or malicious ads."

Most people don’t appear to care. They think the benefits of location tracking outweigh the security and privacy implications. You can make the argument they’re right. Services such as Cortana and Google Search are not as powerful if they can’t monitor your movements. However, you might be less aware of other ways some companies are tracking your location. Often, they use underhand tactics and collate information without you knowing. They are tracking you purely for self-interest. Here are a few ways you probably don’t realize your whereabouts are being tracked. 1. Your Android’s Battery Yes, your smartphone has a range of GPS and location-sensitive hardware. However, you can turn off most of it. Your phone won’t be as useful, but at least app developers won’t know where you are every second of the day. Or will they? In 2015, researchers at Stanford University discovered a surprising and worrisome way that your phone is constantly revealing information about your location Find Your Friends via GPS With These 5 Free Android Apps Find Your Friends via GPS With These 5 Free Android Apps Use these apps to easily find your friends using your phone's built-in GPS.

Amazingly, the team found its method of location tracking worked with 90 percent accuracy. Image Credit: Art Alex via Shutterstock But how does it work? Simply, a phone uses more power the further it is from a communications tower. It also uses more juice if buildings and hills interrupt the line-of-sight. If a hacker monitors the power usage over a five-minute period, location and movement are instantly revealed. Thankfully, the new method still has one major drawback: hackers need a pre-existing power consumption profile of an area before they can correlate a random person’s movements. It’s certainly possible to create, but it’s also time-consuming. “If you take the same ride a couple of times, you’ll see a very clear signal profile and power profile. We show that those similarities are enough to recognize among several possible routes that you’re taking this route or that one, that you drove from Uptown to Downtown, for instance, and not from Uptown to Queens.” — Yan Michalevski, Stanford Researcher But how long will it be until 3D cities on Google Maps and other terrain mapping tools become reliable enough to predict the usage? One suspects the turning point is imminent. 2. Your Car’s Entertainment System Right now, there is an ongoing war between Google, Apple, and the car manufacturers for control of your in-car entertainment hub. Services like Android Auto and Apple CarPlay have led the way in the last couple of years, but manufacturers are starting to fight back. For example, Ford and Toyota have founded a group called the SmartDeviceLink Consortium. In broad terms, it’s an app store made by car manufacturers that runs on any vehicle. Publicly, they say they want to create a seamless user experience for drivers. Privately, it’s all about money. If you’re using Google or Apple apps, the manufacturers are losing vital data. Location data means ads, and ads mean cash. “The lifetime value of a customer to a carmaker is typically around half a million dollars. That value comes from the sale of services and new vehicles. Lose control of the data, and they’re losing out on some piece of that $500,000.” — Roger Lanctot, Analyst with Strategy Analytics By using manufacturer-designed apps, car makers can get their hands on location data more readily. They can recommend repair shops when you need to change a component, refer you to a local insurer if you have an accident, show you ads for deals in nearby grocery stores Cheap Food Can Be Great: 5 Ways to Save Money Cheap Food Can Be Great: 5 Ways to Save Money Food can be expensive, but it doesn't have to break your budget. These ideas for saving money on food will keep money in your wallet while letting you eat well. Read More and a whole lot more. 3. Gas Stations and Carparks Sticking with the theme of cars, manufacturers are finding a bunch of ingenious new ways to find out where you are. Even if you don’t use a GPS system, they can easily establish your location. The problem is especially prevalent in electric cars. For example, the BMW i3 records the car’s 16 most recent charging locations, its 100 last parking spots Google Maps Now Remembers Where You Parked Your Car Google Maps Now Remembers Where You Parked Your Car Google Maps now has the ability to remember where you parked your car. Making Google Maps an indispensible app for anyone who either lives, or regularly travels into, a metropolitan area. Read More , and the geographical coordinates every time the car is turned on or off. All the data is then sent to the car manufacturers, who in turn have admitted to sharing it. Image Credit: jaboo2foto via Shutterstock Worryingly, car manufacturers are not following standard practices for protecting users’ data. In 2014, the US Government Accountability Office investigated 10 car companies. It found five did not disclose why they were sharing location data, none gave customers a way to delete data, and there were huge variances in how long companies retained data. 4. Ultrasonic Signals Some apps are tracking you using audio signals that your phone can pick up, but which are inaudible to a human ear. No, this isn’t a joke, nor is it a bad script for a low-budget sci-fi movie The Worst Movies You Can Watch on Netflix Right Now The Worst Movies You Can Watch on Netflix Right Now Let's face it, there is some joy in watching a truly terrible movie once in a while. Thankfully, there are plenty of bad movies available to watch on Netflix. Read More . This is happening on the streets of your city, right now. The technology is ultrasonic cross-device tracking. Proponents of the technology can embed extremely high pitched tones in everything, and your phone picks them up. Over time, companies get a precise picture of where you’ve been, what you’ve seen, and how long you’ve spent in particular locales. What do I mean by everything? According to research, you can find these “audio beacons” on websites, in retail stores, on road-side billboards, at bus stops, in airports, and in just about every other location you can think of. Currently, an app needs access to your microphone if it wants to use ultrasonic cross-device tracking. This sounds like a bigger problem than it is. Although you — security-conscious MakeUseOf reader — won’t blindly click “Allow” on every permission your phone asks for, many people will. Anyone who’s not confident about using technology is a prime target for the sneaky tactics. “If you’re a company that wants to provide ultrasound tracking there is no other way to do it currently; you have to use the microphone. So you will be what we call ‘over-privileged,’ because you don’t need access to audible sounds but you have to get them.” — Vasilios Mavroudis, Security Researcher at the University of London It sounds shady in its current form, but expect the technology to become more mainstream over the coming years, especially as use of ultrasonic data transfer grows. Once a dedicated API for the technology is available, users can opt in or out. For now, go through every app on your phone and make sure it’s only got the permissions it needs. Does Location Tracking Concern You? I’ve shown you four ways companies are tracking your location without your knowledge. The most troublesome aspect is the purpose of the tracking: in almost every example, the primary benefit is to the tracker rather than the tracked. It raises questions of trust. Should you believe car manufacturers when they say they want to offer you a seamless customer experience? Does your favorite mobile game really need access to your microphone? And why hasn’t Android put a stop to open power consumption monitoring? In all cases, it’s because the status quo benefits them, not you. Are you worried about the future of location tracking? Do you know some sneaky ways that companies are monitoring you that I’ve not discussed? As always, you can leave all your opinions and thoughts in the comments below.

Google Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) which is a restricted set of HTML tags, no user defined JavaScript or analytics, and they cache the pages in their network. The public intent is to speed up the web by reducing web page bloat. Of course, some people have a problem with this such as Kill Google AMP before it KILLS the web. By using this service Google is basically hosting publisher content with the ability to insert their own material. Or even worse giving credibility to propaganda websites because the URLs start with google.co. A prefix can make fishing attacks even more effective. A round up of criticisms. Google AMP is Not a Good Thing Scott Gilbertson: ‘Kill Google AMP Before It Kills the Web’ Metafilter's Idlewords-Maciej Ceglowski chimes in with FOOLISH SOLUTIONS FOR BLOAT posted by KaizenSoze (43 comments total) 23 users marked this as a favorite   I'll just paste n-gate's summary of the Hacker News discussion. Emphasis is mine: "An internet accurately describes Google's AMP program for what it is -- a barely-disguised attempt to shove more of the internet into itself, the better to track the living shit out of every human being on earth. Hackernews has attempted to avoid this program by using it heavily. Half the comments are Hackernews insisting that it is not only impossible to compete with Google in any way but also insane to try. Some Googles show up to assure everyone that this is for the greater good, and if you'd all just stop talking and get in line the whole process will be nearly painless. A few Hackernews suggest that AMP's feature set can be replicated with a "stop shoving every fucking possible line of javascript into every single pageload" approach, but they are quickly chloroformed and edited out of past Christmas photos."posted by JoeZydeco at 8:18 AM on June 2 [37 favorites] It's actually a real worry, on the other hand they have a very real counterpoint in the form of all the malware, shit and bloat publishers put on top of their non-AMP pages. posted by Artw at 8:21 AM on June 2 [4 favorites] As someone who cares about the open web, AMP makes me very nervous. As a user of a mobile phone, AMP is a delight. When I see the little lightning bolt icon I know I'll get instant page loading. Without it, I could well be in for a 5 second wait - or longer - even when I'm on LTE. As a veteran web engineer, watching companies building AMP pages and discovering that you can serve the same content in less than a tenth of the bytes if you just leave out all that "modern" JavaScript is pretty satisfying. This may end up being AMP's most valuable contribution. posted by simonw at 8:26 AM on June 2 [23 favorites] As a veteran web engineer, watching companies building AMP pages and discovering that you can serve the same content in less than a tenth of the bytes if you just leave out all that "modern" JavaScript is pretty satisfying. This may end up being AMP's most valuable contribution. It sounds like WebAssembly is starting to gain some steam, which is well-timed. It'll be nice to have some concrete alternatives available once people are ready to jump off the JS Framework train for good. posted by tobascodagama at 8:30 AM on June 2 [1 favorite] I thought their latest attempt at controlling the web was Contributor. posted by 7segment at 8:32 AM on June 2 I'm really torn about AMP. I like the basic technology, the super-fast stripped down pages. I guiltily like it when I get an AMP link on my iPhone because I know it's going to load fast and be readable. OTOH the way Google intercepts the traffic and hosts caches the page is really awful and predatory. It feels like a walled garden. The weird thing is AMP is not intended to be a walled garden; as arrogant as Google can be they're not quite that bad. There's an open spec for running your own AMP cache; Cloudflare even runs one. I don't honestly know how well it works in practice though, I've never seen a non-Google AMP cache in practice. Anyone have an example? Does Google treat it as a first class AMP resource in its search results page or do they give their own cache special treatment? posted by Nelson at 8:39 AM on June 2 [9 favorites] WebAssembly just seems like a way for advertisers to shovel in even worse horrors TBH. posted by Artw at 8:40 AM on June 2 [4 favorites] A solid strategy is to never go on the web again. Goodbye. EDIT: Back. I've come to my senses. posted by Nanukthedog at 8:41 AM on June 2 [15 favorites] oh man I hate AMP, on my phone I'd love a way to turn it off. posted by Carillon at 8:56 AM on June 2 [3 favorites] Surely this advertising company means well with their efforts to pull all web content under their umbrella. posted by truex at 8:59 AM on June 2 [8 favorites] Web developers, especially for the news, have been irresponsible and they now require correction. Had their chance, and fucking blew it. posted by save alive nothing that breatheth at 9:00 AM on June 2 [12 favorites] I switched my iPhone's default search to DuckDuckGo this morning because that seems to be the only way to avoid it. It's so disorienting. posted by mariokrat at 9:04 AM on June 2 [3 favorites] We run an nonprofit online science magazine that doesn't use AMP because it offers a user experience that's weird, disorienting and feels "wrong". We might lose traffic because of it, but I think having a better product is more important than being visible, and we feel that we will receive long run gains over short term potential gains. posted by HakaiMagazine at 9:14 AM on June 2 [1 favorite] Re Nelson's comment: My sense is that running your own AMP Cache is meaningless unless you have a critical mass of other sites running through it where there's a decent likelihood of the cached AMP pages actually being called. So CloudFlare hosts enough traffic where that makes sense, and them "AMP-ifying" all their customers' pages is a way to improve that. But just because you can pull the source and spin up your own AMP cache on your own machine doesn't mean it'd actually accomplish anything useful. posted by LeDiva at 9:23 AM on June 2 I'm always happy to see AMP links on my phone. They load faster, look better and don't have garbage on them. The web community should make an open standard that delivers the same quality. Until then, I don't see how you can criticize Google for doing it. posted by demiurge at 9:29 AM on June 2 [2 favorites] The web community should make an open standard that delivers the same quality. Until then, I don't see how you can criticize Google for doing it That's an excellent point. I think for all that everyone talks about mobile stuff, web dev has really given it short shrift. posted by lumpenprole at 9:40 AM on June 2 AMP is mostly a defensive maneuver, to encourage publishers to leave content accessible on the public web and prevent Facebook or other apps from walling off every single news article where Google can't crawl it. In other words, this is less about giving Google control and more about preventing Facebook from taking more. posted by xthlc at 9:50 AM on June 2 [4 favorites] Web developers, especially for the news, have been irresponsible and they now require correction. Had their chance, and fucking blew it. The webdevs I know in journalism HATE HATE HATE all the garblebloat as much as anyone does - more so, I think, because they are forced to do it. The whole thing is driven by ad sales, who absolutely refuse to acknowledge that piling on more shit is in any way counterproductive, and long ago made it perfectly clear to dev (and editorial) that any deviation from this is not welcome and will not be heard, so keep your bloody nerdy traps shut. As for AMP - what, precisely, would you do instead? Bonus points for practicality. posted by Devonian at 10:19 AM on June 2 [10 favorites] As a user, I hate AMP because the carousel tends to surface lower quality sites just because they happen to use AMP. You also stumble onto the odd article where something in it doesn't work and it's practically impossible to get to the regular mobile web version to see the content you are missing. Sharing is also an odd experience. The mobile web needs some speed improvements, AMP and FB's Instant Articles are not the answer. posted by missmerrymack at 10:31 AM on June 2 [1 favorite] Y'all, I am rolling my eyes SO HARD at the framing of this post. Caching is not "hosting" or "controlling" anything. It's one of the most common techniques in computer science for speeding things up. If Google wanted to alter the content of pages without the owner's (and/or users’) consent, just operating a search engine is enough to make that possible. Running a cache doesn't give Google much in the way of new opportunities to be evil. If Google were using AMP to maliciously alter page content (a.k.a. run a man-in-the-middle attack), it would be front-page news all over the place. At a minimum, content providers would drop AMP like a hot potato, and any company that has any kind of business relationship with Google would re-evaluate that relationship. I'm other words, Google wouldn't do that because it would be Trump-level stupid for them (or any legitimate company) to openly adopt the tactics of a Russian botnet. posted by shponglespore at 10:32 AM on June 2 [4 favorites] AMP pages don't work on my iPhone. What am I doing wrong? posted by grog at 10:34 AM on June 2 My sense is that running your own AMP Cache is meaningless unless you have a critical mass of other sites running through it where there's a decent likelihood of the cached AMP pages actually being called. I'm confused on this point and haven't seen enough good writing about AMP to clarify. Does anyone here know? What if Metafilter built an AMP version of the site. And ran its own AMP cache using some open source AMP server and served pages with AMP markup. Let's assume its hosted it on the same machine as the main MeFi web server, so there's no CDN benefits. But wouldn't there still be the benefit of AMP markup being small and fast and render nicely on mobile? Only Metafilter would own everything and Google would not be involved at all? My real question is whether Google search would show Metafilter's AMP cache links in this scenario. How does Google decide to show an AMP link in the search results page instead of a regular link? Does it specially treat its own AMP cache differently from third parties? posted by Nelson at 10:40 AM on June 2 AMP frequently brings my ~2yo phone to its knees for reasons I cannot begin to explain. It is a goddamn pox and I hate it with a passion. Kill it with fire. posted by tocts at 10:58 AM on June 2 [2 favorites] Until then, I don't see how you can criticize Google for doing it. It's not like you could use the google.com in the web address for anything, right. It's a fucking dumb idea. It's reminiscent of the '90s where not-so-prolific brands gave away their domain names to content networks to appear as subdomains under said content network. posted by Talez at 10:59 AM on June 2 [8 favorites] But is AMP brutalist? posted by tobascodagama at 11:00 AM on June 2 [2 favorites] AMP is bullshit, but there really DOES need to be some kind of a simplification of page loads. It's gotten beyond out of control. Web devs may be conscious of the problem (certainly, not all of them are, and not everybody producing content for the web CAN be considered a web dev), but as stated earlier, they still do it. All AMP does is trade one evil for another. posted by destructive cactus at 11:13 AM on June 2 I switched my iPhone's default search to DuckDuckGo this morning because that seems to be the only way to avoid it. Yep. AMP pushed me to switch my default search to DuckDuckGo on my iPhone earlier this year. If it becomes standard for desktop results* i’ll be switching on my laptop and desktop computers as well. Or i suppose i could just Bing it. * I won’t sign in to Google to save any preferences settings so that they can track me better; i use the Self-Destructing Cookies Firefox extension to flush my cookies anyway. posted by D.C. at 11:15 AM on June 2 [1 favorite] BTW if you really want to get mad about Google changing the web, get a load of their ad blocking plans. posted by Nelson at 11:15 AM on June 2 [8 favorites] Web developers, especially for the news, have been irresponsible and they now require correction. This is a true statement. I have mixed feelings about AMP per se, but my Windows/Android/Ubuntu install is not just a bootloader for my web browser. I don't want my browser to be able to execute arbitrary code approximately automatically, and I don't want content to require I allow it to execute arbitrary code in order to access it. (I rarely get what I want) posted by PMdixon at 11:30 AM on June 2 [4 favorites] My understanding is that you can run your own AMP cache if you want, but Google will use its own cache whenever it serves a hit that comes from search. Given that, I don't really see the point of running your own cache. This allows Google to preload AMP results in the background and to support the swipey-swipey between results in the carousel, but it also breaks the URL, you know, just the basic building block of the web. As for AMP - what, precisely, would you do instead? Bonus points for practicality. Don't make shitty websites? BTW if you really want to get mad about Google changing the web, get a load of their ad blocking plans. Yeah. This is the terrifying part, and the point where Google tries to wind up as the middleman for an enormous quantity of journalism. posted by zachlipton at 11:36 AM on June 2 [1 favorite] It's not like you could use the google.com in the web address for anything, right. It's important to understand that the issues people have with this is not because "Google came out with some thoughts on speeding up websites by using less garbage", it's generally because "Google came out with some thoughts on speeding up websites...and then has all those pages show up as living under Google.com, and only added a (quirky) way to get the real link as an afterthought. And they figured they'd break native scrolling behaviors for fun too." posted by Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug at 11:37 AM on June 2 [2 favorites] > AMP is bullshit, but there really DOES need to be some kind of a simplification of page loads. It's gotten beyond out of control. You could have a word with Google regarding GWT and Angular, which have done a lot to bring the cost of generating web bloat to levels affordable by small and medium-size businesses. posted by ardgedee at 11:52 AM on June 2 [3 favorites] (I mean, Google's far from the only instigator; extJS predates them all and Facebook has React and there are innumerable other projects as well, but Google's done the yeoman's work by backing core toolkits and popularizing the MVC approach.) posted by ardgedee at 11:55 AM on June 2 Oh my God I didn't know what this was but I knew I hated it! I thought I was doing something wrong because I couldn't copy and paste links correctly to send them to people anymore! posted by brilliantine at 12:04 PM on June 2 [2 favorites] AMP is bullshit, but there really DOES need to be some kind of a simplification of page loads. Totally. Here is my personal craaaaaazy idea: Stop putting all that insane fucking tracky bullshit, unasked-for-streaming-media, and processor-chewing nonsense JS on every page load. Instead, use regular old HTML. I bet you could even define a standard structure that is a strict subset of regular-ass HTML and is easily validated with some common tool that isn't another obvious massive power grab. I spent some time yesterday combing through the AMP introductory materials. It's a bullshit spec, and there is not as far as I can tell a single advantage conferred by the technology involved that requires any of the power grab aspects. Google sucks. posted by brennen at 12:22 PM on June 2 [3 favorites] I mean:

In my experience, this is entirely the result of marketing/sales and the pursuit of another nickle in ad revenue. In the end, advertising is what is destroying the Internet through all of its indirect demands and influences.

I thought I was doing something wrong because I couldn't copy and paste links correctly to send them to people anymore! ...and this is exactly what forced me off Google, on mobile at least. I am guilty of being the group oversharer on a number of WhatsApp threads and AMP cramps my style, which favors natural links (for maximum flexibility) and zero link barf. Of course I favour speedy page loads and no ad/script bloat, but that needs to be the source's responsibility. Nice try Googs, but 😒😒😒 to your "innocent" attempt. posted by Ten Cold Hot Dogs at 5:12 PM on June 2 But is AMP brutalist? Back in the day we called it WAP... posted by Foci for Analysis at 5:30 PM on June 2 [6 favorites] unasked-for-streaming-media Oh shit, I hate that. Autoplay videos, and layovers, should be punishable by jail time. The sentence should be doubled for anyone who does it on a mobile device. Also, pro-tip dickweed websites I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO SEND ME NOTIFICATIONS. EVER. IN A MILLION YEARS. (also sharing my location is something that happens like once every three years for very specific reasons. Odds are not good your website meets those reasons). posted by smoke at 6:46 PM on June 2 [10 favorites] I can argue this one both ways. It is in Google's financial interest to increase their monopoly - recall Facebook's success in getting companies to put their brand after facebook.com - and if you're a shareholder, a monopoly's a beautiful thing. So from that perspective, yeah, naughty Google. The other side of the coin is that the web dev community has had a decade and a very free hand to come up with ways of reducing page bloat. By and large, they've wasted the opportunity. (I take my small percentage of responsibility here - I've been as willing to follow the trends as the next developer, up until the utter farce that is the node.js ecosystem.) So Google's come up with a solution to a real problem. It's a problematic solution, but when everyone else is sucking this much... It's been a rare few who have fought the trend of auto-loading videos and 1MB+ PNGs... Ilya Grigorik is a notable example (and he works for Google!) Also the people writing for Smashing Magazine and A List Apart. The actual solution here is what brennen said - clean, semantic HTML and ditching most of your Javascript. But hey! Ditching Javascript means you can't claim to be a rockstar and reinvent the wheel every other week. So that's a no go, obvs. /grumbles posted by iffthen at 7:24 AM on June 3 [1 favorite] Don't blame web developers (mostly).

[Update: Site is live, more details] Google launches Funding Choices, a way for users to pay sites to hide ads Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/06/01 8:01pm PDTJun 1, 2017 54 Plus 1 on G+ 126 Share on Facebook 77 Share on Twitter Total Shares257 Games News Update 1: 2017/06/01 8:01pm PDT The new site for Google Contributor/Funding Choices is live, and offers some new insight into how the service actually works. According to the signup page, each page without ads You may recall Google Contributor, which was a service by Google that allowed users to pay a monthly contribution to see fewer ads online. Your money would directly substitute the money earned by the site for advertisements. Contributor was discontinued in late 2016, with Google saying that an improved version would become available in "early 2017." Today, the company launched Funding Choices, the successor to Contributor. Currently in beta, it allows sites to show a customized message to visitors using an ad blocker. The message asks users to either enable ads for the site, or pay for a pass through Contributor that removes all ads on that site. Unlike the original Contributor, Funding Choices hides more than just AdSense ads If you're reading this and thinking, "I really wish Android Police would do this," then you're in luck. We've been part of Google's internal beta, but we're not quite ready to roll it out. Just know that we are definitely working on it. The new Contributor site doesn't seem to be live yet, but there will likely be more details there soon. Source: Google Update 1: 2017/06/01 8:01pm PDT The new site for Google Contributor/Funding Choices is live, and offers some new insight into how the service actually works. According to the signup page, each page without ads that you view on a site costs a small amount, with publishers apparently able to change the price (most of them seem to use $0.01 per page right now). So assuming $0.01 per page, $1 gets you 100 pages without ads, and Google is offering a $5 pass to start out with. Not bad pricing at all, as long as sites stay around the $0.01 price point. Google also offers a list of sites supporting Google Contributor, which currently includes Beliefnet, Business Insider UK, ComicBook, Eurogamer, Grub Street, Hot Air, Parkers, Patheos, Popular Mechanics, Townhall, Twitchy, and World Wide Gaming.

NexusPhan The ads in AP are not bad. Very reasonable and not intrusive at all. I have this site whitelisted to help support their great work. You should consider it too before funding choices goes live. MJ There is certainly websites with much more obnoxious ads but their is a lot of ads on AP. It's just not an acceptable user experience and I not going to subject myself to it. I have been calling for a way to donate to AP for awhile now (why did AP have to wait for a Google solution?) so we see how this plays out. Zachary Dunn Ecommerce is hard. Most small outlets like AP prefer a platform that can handle the security and financial liability. MJ I am not talking about ecommerce but making donations. LOL Alex Dueppen Unfortunately Disqus hasn't been the same way, it seems to often load ads that redirect you to those scam "You are winner" pages that try to look like facebook.

Meaning some guy that already has a disqus acct, but found the site because he needs a new phone, can instantly comment without having to sign up for another account at another site. needa I never thought about Disqus throwing in ads. Sort of makes me feel like an idiot for not seeing what is right in front of me. Now it all makes sense. Thanks. Marcelove Would you work to remove the Outbrain and Taboola cancer networks too? Keep any of those at AP makes any other changes useless... tnt How can you tell what is from Disqus vs the site? Justin W I'd agree that AP's ads aren't bad, but Disqus's are terrible. Irwin LOL are you seriuos? on mobile, like half the site is all ads. It's ridiculous. blueman24 I'm ok with whitelist for sites like AP on desktop but on mobile, I don't want any ads. AP can add 5 more ads on their desktop site but don't cripple performance on my already slow phone. Marcelove Never while it still use Taboola or Outbrain as ads delivers... Both are cancers and any site promoting them shall stay adblocked... No matter how much I like a site, or as good it is, if it decides to use those networks... Doing that equals being automatically added and never removed from my blacklist and everyone should do that to enforce it is unacceptable... tnt I'm with you 100%. They're pure trash. Add Revcontent in there as well. wow Why are they "cancers"? I mean, from what I see outbrain ads are trashy and slow but I don't understand why that's an automatic blacklist for a site that provides quality content for free. Do they have malware or something? (This is referring to those fake news ads above the comment section, right?) EcE APK Mirror - - I do not feel guilty and will happily wait my 10 seconds rather than see 200 ads per page and pop ups (or whatever they are called which are basically the same) whenever I need an APK. Rashad Would it be a one time cost or is this a cost each time we visit a participating site? Corbin Davenport I believe it's a monthly subscription, just like the previous Contributor. MJ Questions? Why did AP have to wait for a Google solution? There are many ways you could have been collecting money all this time. A automatic monthly subscription? Sounds like a loser already as people hate that. It's not going to be a set amount but like pick an amount right? An annual subscription would make more sense. Why can't there just be a simple donate button so people could send money when they can and just continuing blocking the ads ourselves like we have been already doing? Cai Copley It's that you do it in one, centralized location for such a subscription, and not doing it over a series of sites and forgetting how much you're spending. MJ I guess need more details on how it works... Jeff Beck We'll have a special rate for you MJ. .005 cents per article, $15 per grumpy comment submitted. We are going to make a fortune off you ;) Maxr1998 Starting the day with a smile thanks to your witty comments. Thanks Jeff! :D George https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4ba5750c423a92daff44db461bb3042c433e0f5e7edc1f8dadcb32198db0d5e8.jpg Artem Russakovskii It's almost here. Just finishing final testing. Mark Curtis Or just block ads and not pay! I'm entitled to free content! gimme gimme gimme. faceless128 it's about safety. there are so many malicious advertisements out there. if a site doesn't directly control the ads that show up, how can they ensure our safety? Camerooni I use privacy badger.. if it blocks ads that play bad - I'm okay with that alongside blocking tracking cookies etc. What I don't like is sites assuming that if you're blocking an ad network that plays bad with you that you're the bad guy.. Things have to work both ways. Mark Curtis AdBlocking started way back when they were simple JPGs with no JavaScript at all. It could even go back to that and people would complain about having to download the bytes. Ailín Ó’S I wonder will this work internationally or just USA only because I use adblock and don't have AP (for example) whitelisted because of the sheer volume of ads on the site especially from the likes of Disqus with their "Congrats! You're a winner!" and "Local man makes 999.999€ a day with this trick!" spam. cadtek91 I'd imagine it would work with anyone with a Google account? Fabrice Thomas Seems like it's only available in these contries: US, Germany, New Zealand and UK https://support.google.com/contributor/answer/6182581?hl=en Jeff Beck If you want to just pay me directly I'll give you my PayPal address. That'll make things even easier on you. I know, I'm way too nice to you all, you're welcome. DavidW dogecoins or gtfo TechGuy22 Thanks but I'll stick adblock and adaway needa If you guys are wanting input, which I know you didn't ask for, five bucks a year would be my max. Not sure how it works, but I would want that on my mobile device. Desktop chrome has what I need in an extension. Ultimately that would earn more money from me, as i get on this sight far less with mobile chrome. Good_Ole_Pinocchio 5 bucks a year? What does that Pay for? Beer for the staff? needa If everyone that comes to this site with adblock paid five bucks, I doubt they would complain. Jeffrey Spiers Brave browser has this built into the browser directly, have used the feature on some of my most frequented sites. Switched to Brave due to many sites detecting and bitching about ad blockers recently. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Web Ads are trash, always. But I've never used ad blockers. Because if I'm taking the content, I'm taking the ads, or I just don't go to the site if the ads are really horrible. I'd more than pay for no ads. psy spy You have to sign in to your gmail account for this to work? Easier to track us. _jack_ It would be nicer to have this from another company, yes. I also wonder, how much Google keeps for themselves? Godspoken Would there even be a difference between you being signed in to your Google account with this vs without? You're using Android and Google services, I don't know what you'd expect. abc I don't browse from my phone so I'm rarely signed into Google, and this will blow some people's minds on this site - but some of us only use two or three Google apps/services, not the whole damn suite. Lord Argyris The official blurb is a little vague. Each time I visit a page without ads, my pass/account/whatever has the site's chosen cost deducted from it. What constitutes a "page"? If I refresh the tab, does that count as an additional page load? What if I visit an article again at a later date? What about those obnoxious sites that have an automatic reload timer? Could they game FC users? I'm sure all these questions will be answered in time. What I would have liked to have seen is some sort of a multiple tier system, whereby I can select specific participants (e.g AP) and offer to pay a flat monthly rate rather than a per-page fee, then leave the normal fee structure in place for others. It would be an easy way to donate more than I would ordinarily accumulate to places I come frequently, without forcing said sites to set up their own donation system. No matter what tier FC visitors choose, the site gets money. FelschR It's stated quite clearly: "Note: you are charged each time you visit or refresh a page, even if you have previously visited it." https://support.google.com/contributor/answer/7359560?hl=en&ref_topic=6182570 Lord Argyris Okay, that answers that. The blurb on the page linked in the article lacked that more detailed information. Matías Duarte I've only used AdBlock for AP the moment that those ads magically opened a new popup while scrolling without even touching them. Now that the annoying problem is gone, I've disabled it. I know no one cares about this but I finally got accepted for a job and I'll get my very first payment tomorrow, so I would happily pay a contribution for this page! Jeff Beck I'll be one to care. Congrats! Getting paid is awesome. At least that's what the other writers at AP tell me. Kostas 💪🎩 😂😂😂😂😂😂 imneveral0ne I just had a you're a winner one pop up on my phone with android police, so it's definitely not gone. ZettabyteGamer How long till I can use this with you guys? I'm itching to try it out, but this is the only site I really read everyday. Necdet Ali Özdür I think the real question here is what Google means by "fewer ads". Are all kinds of ads will be blocked or just intrusive ones? Will the trackers also be removed? someone755 Hmmm... https://youtu.be/4ezd24krgiQ Powsniffer0110 I'd be happy to pay 1¢ an article on AP and Phandroid, XDA ect.! Powsniffer0110 This is funny as hell lol. We're now paying Google to NOT give us ads... Haha. YaKillaCJ Or continue using AdAway, uBlock Origins and DNS Host Blocking via my router. Many can say what they want but my stance is simple. I won't pay just to "not be inconvenienced and intrused on". Any dev, content providers or ect can easily find many non intrusive ways to advertise. Just_No_Stop This whole situation could have been avoided if ads weren't so intrusive, ugly, malicious, irrelevant and numerous. Some pages use less than a tenth of the data with ads blocked, which is crazy, and any ad that slows the delivery of content is unacceptable. It still baffles me how such appalling ads can be effective, if they piss you off why would you then want the product? Paying not to have to put up with such things is not on, I will keep blocking until sites have better ad policies. dancedar1 'Google offering a $5 pass' reads as though they are giving you $5 credit to try it out - they're not; it's £/$5 minimum mattcoz I also read it that way. 4Ui812 1 cent per page isn't a sustainable business model once users realize how much money they'll blow through. Sites that depend on advertising would be better served by using some sort of royalties model like the way radio stations do with music and artists/labels. Otherwise ad blockers are here to stay.Of course Google will want they're cut. 4Ui812 I'd be willing to turn off my ad blocker and sign up Google Contributor/Funding Choices for the free $5 and then I'd blow it all on this site so you guys and gals can have the money. Once it's gone though my ad blocker will be turned back on :-) Ad blocker is used for security reasons. tmartin Will it remove that Outbrain chum? I really need that stuff to go away. needa I use adguard and there is not one single avertisement on this page. There is a spot for outbrain, but no ads. tmartin I use Ghostery mostly because of the chum and that takes care of it, but I wouldn't mind supporting AP. needa I wouldn't mind either. I turn my blocker off periodically to help out. From the looks of it Google will have the answers we need soon enough with their new chrome filter that they are working on. Hopefully then we will be able to support our favorite sites without being slowed down by the ads. Marcelove Wall Street Journal will use it or it will keep that aggressive paywall? Because allowing only 10 articles is like grabbing the print version, take only one sheet and give to someone saying "If you wanna read more than 1 sheet per month, you need to pay us". I'm not against a publisher using a paywall, but the restriction here is so absurd that even if I was 100% determined to subscribe, I wouldn't only because at this example the newspaper is being douchebag... 30 articles, or 1 per day, would really mean that it was caring about itself and the public... But only 10 shows that it don't give a f*ck about the public and is only caring about itself... Anthony Castanza This is a substantial regression from the old version. Morten Ulv How did the old one work? rap 1¢ per page would add up very fast. By the time I read a couple of favorite blogs each day that would be $20 per month. jdrch $0.01 per page sounds doable. Lars Jeppesen Not available in my countries... Gen. Chang The point is to force the ad industry and websites to change the way they operate. Not reward them for more bad behavior. If it was not for the privacy intrusive models they use, there would not be as big a problem.

Google confirms it will block bad ads in Chrome, starting in early 2018 Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/06/01 3:35pm PDTJun 1, 2017 83 Plus 1 on G+ 441 Share on Facebook 121 Share on Twitter Total Shares645 Applications Google News About two months ago, the Wall Street Journal reported that Google would add an ad-blocking feature into the Chrome web browser. Similar to AdBlock Plus' default setting, Chrome would block ads deemed unacceptable (such as pop-ups, auto-playing video ads, etc). Google has now confirmed this, and shared further details about how it will work. In a post on the company's blog, Google announced that it is joining the Coalition for Better Ads, an industry group attempting to improve online ads. The group has developed the Better Ads Standards, a list of guidelines for desktop and mobile ads based on comprehensive research. Ads deemed unacceptable include pop-ups, auto-playing video ads with sound, large sticky ads, and other common formats. In the post, Google confirmed that Chrome will soon not show ads, including those served by Google, on websites not in compliance with the Better Ads Standards. The change will take effect in "early 2018." This is huge news, especially considering that Google serves more online ads than any company on Earth. Now that Chrome has approximately 60% of the desktop browser market share (and growing), sites will likely have no choice than to follow the guidelines.

Can get rid of those annoying app install ads when browsing on the phone! Corbin Davenport Yeah, I think those are included, since they stick to the top while scrolling. Mgamerz Great news, but I guarantee you there's going to be a shitstorm headed their way really quick. Corbin Davenport Oh for sure. Something something free market. bekifft This is huge. However if they don't address the issue of deceptive ads, it's still a big problem. Hopefully one day I can finally in good conscience stop installing ad blockers as simply a security measure to protect my users. Corbin Davenport I haven't looked through all of the standard's documentation, but I don't see anything about deceptive ads. But I agree, that should be addressed. My1 not really android related but when these things like get 10000 euro in a month easily show up in SKYPE, an application by MICROSOFT that hurts, and they even have HTTPS ads with certificate errors Eli Stevens I get the job done from convenience of my place, with very simple projects that only needs only from you a Desktop computer system as well as web connection and I am happier than before...

Cat Astrophy Deceptive is extremely hard to deal with and far more subjective. "Bad" can be virus ridden, or employing technical methods that can be detected automatically (like pop ups). Gregory Will there be an option to block all ads without exceptions? Corbin Davenport Most likely not. Artem Russakovskii Sort of, but if you subscribe to sites running Funding Choices and use Contributor to buy an ad-free pass. Which is how it should be if you want to enjoy quality content from creators. Good ads and free if you don't. No ads and small fee if you do. Bimmer Ime or you can install an adblocker and enjoy no ads and no fee :) Tom Westrick And the sites you enjoy won't be able to sustain themselves... Nathan J Are they hurting now? Because that's what we have now. We have ad blockers, and we have ABP with its acceptable ads, but a lot of people turn it off. How about the sack on that guy, telling the main guy at AP to block ads on his own site? I'm a block-everything guy too, but I'm going to be seriously looking into this Funding Choices thing. I don't want my ad-free page views being wasted on just any old site, but sites I read daily, like AP and Neowin, I definitely want to see them get their cut. Cakefish ABP allows through Taboola, Outbrain and Revcontent. The polar opposite of acceptable ads. R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ That would kill the internet and you would have to pay for everything. Ads are what make the internet free Gregory You know, they can always make money on others, not on me. Most people don't bother blocking ads, they simply don't care. Mark Curtis Yeah gimme free entertainment, but YOU foot the bill! David The internet was in fact a much *worse* place before ads became a thing. All the nice stuff you have access to now only exists because of ad revenue (email, YouTube, any and all social networking platforms) Toys Samurai He reminds me of some people whom I know -- always say they hate ads and would rather pay for it. But when the content provider actually asks for money, they don't open up their wallets. Jorgen Phillips This is the most hippocritical thing I think I have ever read. Toys Samurai Exactly. This very site he's reading would not even exist if everyone blocks ads. David That's not true, they could just use a different monetization model. Nathan J Hypocritical. You may be thinking of the hippocratic oath, where the famous phrase "do no harm" comes from. If only ads would pledge to do no harm... abc You can pay for it and I'll coast for free. Ha ha, I'm a dick! Nathan J There already is. That's what we have now. I mean, we have the no ad blocker option, which is default. Then you have Adblock Plus's default setting, which whitelists ads ABP considers to be not malicious. And that's what Google is doing. Then you have ABP with that feature turned off, or something like uBlock Origin, that just blocks all the ads indiscriminately. This is a future measure that is designed to be more tolerant than current "all or nothing" solutions, plus Google is an advertising business. So, there probably won't be. Eddy Nelson Lopez They profit from it, why would they do it? 😂😂 Corbin Davenport They won't profit from it if a majority of users have an ad blocker. Which is where things are headed right now. exadeci They can blocks ads from everyone except theirs and having the most popular browser they can sell the exclusivity to other ad agencies. Corbin Davenport "In the post, Google confirmed that Chrome will soon not show ads, including those served by Google, on websites not in compliance with the Better Ads Standards." exadeci Couldn't they just prevent bad ads on their platform?! Imparus The problem is how you serve them to the user. If you create a popup filled with Google ads, it would be bad ads even thought they are Google approved ads. exadeci Right but if they can detect it in Chrome why can't they use this to disable the ads on the website that abuses it? Sonny Bono I'm guessing it's a preventative measure, seeing how many people get virused through some popup ads that they don't realize are a pathway to malicious software. We certainly don't want another epidemic of ransomware. I find most of my service calls go to elderly people who have no idea what they're doing and get tons of malware/ransomware. One old lady I was working with a few weeks ago actually "called microsoft" per the directions on her browser and gave them her credit card number. It wasn't really microsoft. abqnm As long as it takes care of the shady JavaScript click event pop-unders and other such js deceptive ad techniques which are generally not able to be caught by ad-blockers. I would really love to be able to go back to having JavaScript enabled and blacklist only certain sites rather than have to keep it disabled and whitelist the majority of my internet experience. TW Does this mean my phone won't connect constantly start vibrating because of ads on legitimate sites? raazman I'm sorry you have to experience this is this day and age. AintaDamnThingFunny This!! I've always wondered how those got through Chrome's security. I mean, it's an obtrusive add that makes your phone vibrate, and all you can do is close out the browser. How the hell do those get through and how has Google not stopped this from happening? Imparus Because a website can access the vibrator API, this is useful in the example of facebook, where you can activate notification for the site, and not having to use their shitty app. TW Now I know what to call the thing I hate: Vibrator API Total Insecurity For some reason female users like this API... BRO i prefer my phone silent, no notification sound or vibration, as i mostly use my pc with pushbullet mirroring My1 what the hell, how about they just pop a notif and let the phone do the rest? Imparus Okay so it was a bad example with facebook, since it is the notification API they are using not the vibration one, which means it follows the same rules as other applications. I should just have said a game might use it, but at the moment it is mainly used for BS ads. My1 okay, but I see no point in point in using the vibration on a website anyway. Imparus PWA, I mentioned game, since PWA is one of the new thing that is very likely to become huge in the next few years. Here you can try some few application made in it https://pwa.rocks/ so it is more that you should be ready for a paradigm change in what a website is, since the line between webapp and normal app will almost disappear. Example I use the QR scanner, so I don't have to have a dedicated app for it. My1 well honestly I think the PWA stuff is taking it too far, especially games, I mean dont they run better when compiled and optimized for an OS? also websites are supposed to work on any device that has a more or less modern browser and when games need for example multitouch, that thing is not really funny on a device without touch, since I cant summon a second mouse arrow. and when websites are starting to lose the point of working pretty much everywhere and becoming a gimmick it's starting to get stupid. especially if you have a bad internet connection these PWAs arent as great as when you just have your application. with the browser opening more and more, it's seriously going to risk opening itself to viruses and stuff Imparus I unfortunately don't have the time at the moment to explain all of these to you, so this will be quick rundown, and the rest you will have to research yourself if you are interested in it. "well honestly I think the PWA stuff is taking it too far, especially games, I mean dont they run better when compiled and optimized for an OS? " For most stuff it isn't a problem at all, as for game if they are simple enough optimization isn't as relevant. Most game would be written for an engine like unity or unreal, and one of the new thing in relation to PWA are modules, that will allow the use of engine like that, it also allow webapps to work completely offline. There will of course be some apps that are very heavy in computation on device that will make sense to run with native code that can run better, but there are being worked on optimizing things such as JS to make it run faster. "also websites are supposed to work on any device that has a more or less modern browser and when games need for example multitouch, that thing is not really funny on a device without touch, since I cant summon a second mouse arrow." You can have the browser serve different code depending on the device, that actually isn't anything new. "and when websites are starting to lose the point of working pretty much everywhere and becoming a gimmick it's starting to get stupid. " PWA actually allow apps to work everywhere, instead of just the OS you coded it to. Having one single code base would be great for pretty much every company. "especially if you have a bad internet connection these PWAs arent as great as when you just have your application." You can easily code for it to work offline, take the QR scanner on the side I linked you, I don't need internet to use it at all. Think of PWA like normal apps, if you use twitter then try using the PWA they have created. "with the browser opening more and more, it's seriously going to risk opening itself to viruses and stuff" Not really, this is one of the thing I will say you need to research yourself, since it will be quite a long explanation, I would start by looking into why chromeOS is more secure than Windows. I said there will be a huge grow with PWA over the next few years, since it is still very early in its development, only Firefox and Chrome support it at the moment and Edge will bring support in fall. AintaDamnThingFunny Right, but websites always ask me for permission if I want their notifications. Facebook using the vibrator API with your permission is one thing. Having an obtrusive add use it without your permission is another. Imparus That is because a website don't need to ask for permission, so it is more that Google should make it a permission check before allowing to use the vibration. Santos Chavez OMG I hate those types of ads! Especially when the ads that popup are so obstrusive I can't do anything but exit Chrome. Ugh! Rob Yeah, but some people love the vibrator API. hooch Holy shit I didn't even know this was a thing. Been using Firefox + uBlock Origin for a couple of years. blindexecutioner Doesn't affect me much. I already block ads. Nathan J It's not meant to affect you or I or anyone else who knows what uBlock Origin is. Google Chrome is the most popular browser, so I imagine what it will affect is the 60% or however many people use Chrome, and all of a sudden they're blocking malicious ads. That will affect a lot. I suspect for you and I, we will probably be able to just disable Google's solution and use our own, and if Google blocks other ad blockers, there's always Chromium. AS The biggest annoyances for me are subscribe popovers and EU cookie warnings. Things like taboola and outbrain need to be aggressively blocked. My1 cookie warning are annoying but it shows the scary relatity of all the sites that collect data with cookies. Lateef Alabi-Oki I'll disable my ad blocker if this gets rid of malicious and egregious ads. Nexus Hexus I'm sure most of these "Bad ads" will be alternative media. Or aka "Whatever we don't agree with" boop It's not content that's blocked, but format. Sonny Bono Ironically, all the ads that I find bothersome are on google services themselves, such as YouTube, but I have a Chrome extension (ublock origin) that works to get rid of them. Santos Chavez I enjoy YouTube so much, I pay for YouTube Red, via the Google Play Music Family Plan . Haven't seen an ad, especially on mobile. for months, and I get unlimited music streaming and downloading, all of those features shared to 5 other users. Pretty neat. Sonny Bono If they throw in free movies with the service I'd be down. I can already get anything I want on demand for no cost. I just appreciate watching random videos and I never know what I'm in the mood for. I'll just keep riding the links down the chain, bar tricks, gun porn, rocket engines, science experiments, old computers, animals and hunting videos... whatever it might be. ublock origin fixes the problem with ads - they don't exist any more - but not with popup windows on some questionable websites. abc Good for you. I use an adblocker and don't see any ads on Youtube. And I don't feel bad taking cents away from a multi-billion dollar corporation. I will never pay for streaming services because I like to own things. I could pay Netflix hundreds of dollars over the course of years, and the moment I disconnect, I am left with zero movies. I'd much rather grab some discs from the bargain bin. Gary But do they block those annoying as hell forced Google surveys? Adam Margeson Forced Google surveys? Where are you seeing those served up? And, are you sure they're legitimately from Google? Lord Argyris "...Google confirmed that Chrome will soon not show ads, including those served by Google, on websites not in compliance with the Better Ads Standards." I'm going to guess they're including their own ads here to avoid anticompetitive suits from competing ad providers. If they just blocked the other ads and left their own (presumably compliant ads), they would be gaining an unfair advantage and could be seen to be leveraging their strength in the browser market to incentivize use of their own ad platform. I wondered about this in my comment on the previous AP article on the subject, and it seems Google has considered the matter as well. Santos Chavez Yeah, it's kinda neat; by doing it that way Google avoids all sorts of blames of being hypocrites while also setting the example for everyone. "THIS", they say, "is how ads should be done. Look, we're even doing them to our own; you should, too". Terra Remove the ads that play before a video and we got a deal. Small banners below the video? Ok. Playing a commercial before the content I actually want to see? That is old tv bullcrap and is annoying as hell, even more so than popups. Dennis Ulijn "But, but, but... Terra: how would you solve this on Chromecast, etc.?" tigerberry Playing a commercial WHILE PLAYING THE DAMN VIDEO I'M ACTUALLY WATCHING? Whoever came up with that should be forced to never use an adblocker ever again. Cakefish Wonderful. Please also add extension support to Android Chrome (it's the number 1 feature that it's missing, desktop Chrome wouldn't have been as popular without it) but this is a good start. Ghirahim Install Opera and have a wonderful life. Jun rip pornhub ads Rod I wonder when they will fix the Notification Download Service bug in v58. https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=719641# Rob Thank goodness. Somehow, we went from doing away with auto-play videos and ads years ago, only to have them pop up a lot in recent months. I'm sick of them. BC Google is finally making a move that I truly approve of. Ads, especially the invasive ones have really taken over. I don't care about banner ads that I see just once or ads on the side. The ones that infuriate me the most are those that obscure content, automatically play loud sounds/videos. Those that try to trick the user into installing something they don't obviously need, need to die in a fire. It's why I've installed Ghostery and use Mercury Reader to banish that bullshit to the depths of the internet hell. I'm also pleased that Google is being smart about this and blocking all invasive content...Even if it comes directly from their company because they need to be impartial and control these insanely bad adverts. Forcing a standard will hopefully make the internet a cleaner place, one that can support the advert model without being deliberately invasive or deceptive. Dragos Lucian The only thing that makes me use an adblocker on a lot of websites, is because, more often than not, you don't even need to click on the ads to be presented with a buttload of new tabs or individual pages. You just need to click on a blank area and boom ! You can barely make your way back to the page you initially were. If those type of ads go away, then I'll make sure to uninstall my adblocker. Till then, fuck everyone who posts those type of ads on their websites in order to gain revenue. Make your money off selling socks. Abhishek Mittal Does this mean my phone wont start buzzing and downloading unwanted apps without my permission? This is huge, a great step by google in improving quality of the internet Spinkick Does it bother anyone that google is the one that decides which ads are bad? abc Google means that they are going to block their competitors ads and only allow their own.

By Crystal Kim June 2, 2017 10:40 a.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Chasing performance has never been more rewarding. Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX), and Alphabet (GOOGL), lovingly called the FANG stocks (before Google ruined it), have delivered gains of more than 30% on average so far this year compared to the S&P 500's 9%. And the group could log another 20%-40% by the end of 2017, says Fundstrat Global Advisors U.S. portfolio strategist Thomas Lee. In a note published today he wrote: "Rarely does FANG reverse its year-to-date gains (only in 2011) and second half outperformance has averaged 17,700 basis points since 2009. Given the substantial top-line and earnings-per-share growth, valuation risk/reward remains favorable." Photo by China Photos/Getty Images Another interesting observation from Lee -- in the past three decades, never have financials, telecom, and energy stocks fallen to the bottom at the same time. The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLF) has fallen 0.66% and the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLE) has declined 1.12%. Meanwhile the SPDR S&P Telecom ETF (XTL) has gained 1.01%. He sees opportunities in all three sectors. "In our view, this speaks to the peculiarity of this market," wrote Lee. "Telecoms lag on inflation surges or higher rates -- favorable for financials and energy." The only other time the bottom three underperformed this much was in 1991 when the U.S. economy was climbing out of recession.

[Update: Site is live, more details] Google launches Funding Choices, a way for users to pay sites to hide ads Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/06/01 8:01pm PDTJun 1, 2017 54 Plus 1 on G+ 126 Share on Facebook 77 Share on Twitter Total Shares257 Games News Update 1: 2017/06/01 8:01pm PDT The new site for Google Contributor/Funding Choices is live, and offers some new insight into how the service actually works. According to the signup page, each page without ads You may recall Google Contributor, which was a service by Google that allowed users to pay a monthly contribution to see fewer ads online. Your money would directly substitute the money earned by the site for advertisements. Contributor was discontinued in late 2016, with Google saying that an improved version would become available in "early 2017." Today, the company launched Funding Choices, the successor to Contributor. Currently in beta, it allows sites to show a customized message to visitors using an ad blocker. The message asks users to either enable ads for the site, or pay for a pass through Contributor that removes all ads on that site. Unlike the original Contributor, Funding Choices hides more than just AdSense ads If you're reading this and thinking, "I really wish Android Police would do this," then you're in luck. We've been part of Google's internal beta, but we're not quite ready to roll it out. Just know that we are definitely working on it. The new Contributor site doesn't seem to be live yet, but there will likely be more details there soon. Source: Google Update 1: 2017/06/01 8:01pm PDT The new site for Google Contributor/Funding Choices is live, and offers some new insight into how the service actually works. According to the signup page, each page without ads that you view on a site costs a small amount, with publishers apparently able to change the price (most of them seem to use $0.01 per page right now). So assuming $0.01 per page, $1 gets you 100 pages without ads, and Google is offering a $5 pass to start out with. Not bad pricing at all, as long as sites stay around the $0.01 price point. Google also offers a list of sites supporting Google Contributor, which currently includes Beliefnet, Business Insider UK, ComicBook, Eurogamer, Grub Street, Hot Air, Parkers, Patheos, Popular Mechanics, Townhall, Twitchy, and World Wide Gaming.

NexusPhan The ads in AP are not bad. Very reasonable and not intrusive at all. I have this site whitelisted to help support their great work. You should consider it too before funding choices goes live. MJ There is certainly websites with much more obnoxious ads but their is a lot of ads on AP. It's just not an acceptable user experience and I not going to subject myself to it. I have been calling for a way to donate to AP for awhile now (why did AP have to wait for a Google solution?) so we see how this plays out. Zachary Dunn Ecommerce is hard. Most small outlets like AP prefer a platform that can handle the security and financial liability. MJ I am not talking about ecommerce but making donations. LOL Alex Dueppen Unfortunately Disqus hasn't been the same way, it seems to often load ads that redirect you to those scam "You are winner" pages that try to look like facebook.

Maxr1998 I hope these cancerous, unblockable Outbrain ads will also be a part of the funding choices, then I'll happily pay - not that I wouldn't contribute anyway, because I feel a bit guilty for blocking ads for a long time already.. Eli Stevens I do the job from comfort and ease of my residence, participating in effortless activities that just require from you a Laptop together with internet access and I am just pleased than ever... After 6 months in this job and therefore managed to get remunerated in whole 36,000 usd...

No outbrain. Just an empty spot above the comments section with sponsored content in one corner and recommended by Outbrain in another. Maxr1998 Hm, interesting. I'm using adaway, maybe I need to tweak my filter lists a little then.. NeverrKnowsBest I have gotten full screen malware ads from AP before. I did not want to block them, but they forced my hand. NexusPhan They did have a bad streak of ads for a while about a year ago. I remember that now that you say it. I enabled ad blocker for a few months after it happened. Corbin Davenport I will say that those are normally from Disqus, and we've worked with Disqus in the past to identify them and get them removed. ZettabyteGamer I'm sure it would be hard but if disqus is causing so many problems, maybe you should switch to a different comment section or make your own? needa They would just have to throw more ads up themselves to pay for it. Disqus is pretty good anyways. Not to mention Disqus is a way to get new people to come back to your site. Meaning some guy that already has a disqus acct, but found the site because he needs a new phone, can instantly comment without having to sign up for another account at another site. needa I never thought about Disqus throwing in ads. Sort of makes me feel like an idiot for not seeing what is right in front of me. Now it all makes sense. Thanks. Marcelove Would you work to remove the Outbrain and Taboola cancer networks too? Keep any of those at AP makes any other changes useless... tnt How can you tell what is from Disqus vs the site? Justin W I'd agree that AP's ads aren't bad, but Disqus's are terrible. Irwin LOL are you seriuos? on mobile, like half the site is all ads. It's ridiculous. blueman24 I'm ok with whitelist for sites like AP on desktop but on mobile, I don't want any ads. AP can add 5 more ads on their desktop site but don't cripple performance on my already slow phone. Marcelove Never while it still use Taboola or Outbrain as ads delivers... Both are cancers and any site promoting them shall stay adblocked... No matter how much I like a site, or as good it is, if it decides to use those networks... Doing that equals being automatically added and never removed from my blacklist and everyone should do that to enforce it is unacceptable... tnt I'm with you 100%. They're pure trash. Add Revcontent in there as well. wow Why are they "cancers"? I mean, from what I see outbrain ads are trashy and slow but I don't understand why that's an automatic blacklist for a site that provides quality content for free. Do they have malware or something? (This is referring to those fake news ads above the comment section, right?) EcE APK Mirror - - I do not feel guilty and will happily wait my 10 seconds rather than see 200 ads per page and pop ups (or whatever they are called which are basically the same) whenever I need an APK. Rashad Would it be a one time cost or is this a cost each time we visit a participating site? Corbin Davenport I believe it's a monthly subscription, just like the previous Contributor. MJ Questions? Why did AP have to wait for a Google solution? There are many ways you could have been collecting money all this time. A automatic monthly subscription? Sounds like a loser already as people hate that. It's not going to be a set amount but like pick an amount right? An annual subscription would make more sense. Why can't there just be a simple donate button so people could send money when they can and just continuing blocking the ads ourselves like we have been already doing? Cai Copley It's that you do it in one, centralized location for such a subscription, and not doing it over a series of sites and forgetting how much you're spending. MJ I guess need more details on how it works... Jeff Beck We'll have a special rate for you MJ. .005 cents per article, $15 per grumpy comment submitted. We are going to make a fortune off you ;) Maxr1998 Starting the day with a smile thanks to your witty comments. Thanks Jeff! :D George https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4ba5750c423a92daff44db461bb3042c433e0f5e7edc1f8dadcb32198db0d5e8.jpg Artem Russakovskii It's almost here. Just finishing final testing. Mark Curtis Or just block ads and not pay! I'm entitled to free content! gimme gimme gimme. faceless128 it's about safety. there are so many malicious advertisements out there. if a site doesn't directly control the ads that show up, how can they ensure our safety? Camerooni I use privacy badger.. if it blocks ads that play bad - I'm okay with that alongside blocking tracking cookies etc. What I don't like is sites assuming that if you're blocking an ad network that plays bad with you that you're the bad guy.. Things have to work both ways. Mark Curtis AdBlocking started way back when they were simple JPGs with no JavaScript at all. It could even go back to that and people would complain about having to download the bytes. Ailín Ó’S I wonder will this work internationally or just USA only because I use adblock and don't have AP (for example) whitelisted because of the sheer volume of ads on the site especially from the likes of Disqus with their "Congrats! You're a winner!" and "Local man makes 999.999€ a day with this trick!" spam. cadtek91 I'd imagine it would work with anyone with a Google account? Fabrice Thomas Seems like it's only available in these contries: US, Germany, New Zealand and UK https://support.google.com/contributor/answer/6182581?hl=en Jeff Beck If you want to just pay me directly I'll give you my PayPal address. That'll make things even easier on you. I know, I'm way too nice to you all, you're welcome. DavidW dogecoins or gtfo TechGuy22 Thanks but I'll stick adblock and adaway needa If you guys are wanting input, which I know you didn't ask for, five bucks a year would be my max. Not sure how it works, but I would want that on my mobile device. Desktop chrome has what I need in an extension. Ultimately that would earn more money from me, as i get on this sight far less with mobile chrome. Good_Ole_Pinocchio 5 bucks a year? What does that Pay for? Beer for the staff? needa If everyone that comes to this site with adblock paid five bucks, I doubt they would complain. Jeffrey Spiers Brave browser has this built into the browser directly, have used the feature on some of my most frequented sites. Switched to Brave due to many sites detecting and bitching about ad blockers recently. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Web Ads are trash, always. But I've never used ad blockers. Because if I'm taking the content, I'm taking the ads, or I just don't go to the site if the ads are really horrible. I'd more than pay for no ads. psy spy You have to sign in to your gmail account for this to work? Easier to track us. _jack_ It would be nicer to have this from another company, yes. I also wonder, how much Google keeps for themselves? Godspoken Would there even be a difference between you being signed in to your Google account with this vs without? You're using Android and Google services, I don't know what you'd expect. abc I don't browse from my phone so I'm rarely signed into Google, and this will blow some people's minds on this site - but some of us only use two or three Google apps/services, not the whole damn suite. Lord Argyris The official blurb is a little vague. Each time I visit a page without ads, my pass/account/whatever has the site's chosen cost deducted from it. What constitutes a "page"? If I refresh the tab, does that count as an additional page load? What if I visit an article again at a later date? What about those obnoxious sites that have an automatic reload timer? Could they game FC users? I'm sure all these questions will be answered in time. What I would have liked to have seen is some sort of a multiple tier system, whereby I can select specific participants (e.g AP) and offer to pay a flat monthly rate rather than a per-page fee, then leave the normal fee structure in place for others. It would be an easy way to donate more than I would ordinarily accumulate to places I come frequently, without forcing said sites to set up their own donation system. No matter what tier FC visitors choose, the site gets money. FelschR It's stated quite clearly: "Note: you are charged each time you visit or refresh a page, even if you have previously visited it." https://support.google.com/contributor/answer/7359560?hl=en&ref_topic=6182570 Lord Argyris Okay, that answers that. The blurb on the page linked in the article lacked that more detailed information. Matías Duarte I've only used AdBlock for AP the moment that those ads magically opened a new popup while scrolling without even touching them. Now that the annoying problem is gone, I've disabled it. I know no one cares about this but I finally got accepted for a job and I'll get my very first payment tomorrow, so I would happily pay a contribution for this page! Jeff Beck I'll be one to care. Congrats! Getting paid is awesome. At least that's what the other writers at AP tell me. Kostas 💪🎩 😂😂😂😂😂😂 imneveral0ne I just had a you're a winner one pop up on my phone with android police, so it's definitely not gone. ZettabyteGamer How long till I can use this with you guys? I'm itching to try it out, but this is the only site I really read everyday. Necdet Ali Özdür I think the real question here is what Google means by "fewer ads". Are all kinds of ads will be blocked or just intrusive ones? Will the trackers also be removed? someone755 Hmmm... https://youtu.be/4ezd24krgiQ Powsniffer0110 I'd be happy to pay 1¢ an article on AP and Phandroid, XDA ect.! Powsniffer0110 This is funny as hell lol. We're now paying Google to NOT give us ads... Haha. YaKillaCJ Or continue using AdAway, uBlock Origins and DNS Host Blocking via my router. Many can say what they want but my stance is simple. I won't pay just to "not be inconvenienced and intrused on". Any dev, content providers or ect can easily find many non intrusive ways to advertise. Just_No_Stop This whole situation could have been avoided if ads weren't so intrusive, ugly, malicious, irrelevant and numerous. Some pages use less than a tenth of the data with ads blocked, which is crazy, and any ad that slows the delivery of content is unacceptable. It still baffles me how such appalling ads can be effective, if they piss you off why would you then want the product? Paying not to have to put up with such things is not on, I will keep blocking until sites have better ad policies. dancedar1 'Google offering a $5 pass' reads as though they are giving you $5 credit to try it out - they're not; it's £/$5 minimum mattcoz I also read it that way. 4Ui812 1 cent per page isn't a sustainable business model once users realize how much money they'll blow through. Sites that depend on advertising would be better served by using some sort of royalties model like the way radio stations do with music and artists/labels. Otherwise ad blockers are here to stay.Of course Google will want they're cut. 4Ui812 I'd be willing to turn off my ad blocker and sign up Google Contributor/Funding Choices for the free $5 and then I'd blow it all on this site so you guys and gals can have the money. Once it's gone though my ad blocker will be turned back on :-) Ad blocker is used for security reasons. tmartin Will it remove that Outbrain chum? I really need that stuff to go away. needa I use adguard and there is not one single avertisement on this page. There is a spot for outbrain, but no ads. tmartin I use Ghostery mostly because of the chum and that takes care of it, but I wouldn't mind supporting AP. needa I wouldn't mind either. I turn my blocker off periodically to help out. From the looks of it Google will have the answers we need soon enough with their new chrome filter that they are working on. Hopefully then we will be able to support our favorite sites without being slowed down by the ads. Marcelove Wall Street Journal will use it or it will keep that aggressive paywall? Because allowing only 10 articles is like grabbing the print version, take only one sheet and give to someone saying "If you wanna read more than 1 sheet per month, you need to pay us". I'm not against a publisher using a paywall, but the restriction here is so absurd that even if I was 100% determined to subscribe, I wouldn't only because at this example the newspaper is being douchebag... 30 articles, or 1 per day, would really mean that it was caring about itself and the public... But only 10 shows that it don't give a f*ck about the public and is only caring about itself... Anthony Castanza This is a substantial regression from the old version. Morten Ulv How did the old one work? rap 1¢ per page would add up very fast. By the time I read a couple of favorite blogs each day that would be $20 per month. jdrch $0.01 per page sounds doable. Lars Jeppesen Not available in my countries... Gen. Chang The point is to force the ad industry and websites to change the way they operate. Not reward them for more bad behavior. If it was not for the privacy intrusive models they use, there would not be as big a problem.

ITProPortal Search RSS News Features Analysis Guides Reviews Categories Business Hardware Security Software Mobile Enterprise Cloud Networks Public Sector Startups Web What Google’s new payments functionality really means for banks By Daniel Döderlein Feature  As the mobile payments market continues to grow, Google and Apple will become a bank's biggest competitors. Shares A couple of weeks ago, Google announced its new payments functionality. The new functionality allows anyone using Google’s API (online stores, for example) to give their customers the ability to pay using any of their cards they currently have stored in their Google accounts.  The mobile payments market is predicted to grow to USD 17.56 billion by 2021. Currently, Apple Pay users are thought to outnumber Android Pay users. It should come as no real surprise, then, that Google would want to take a stake in this multi-billion dollar market.  At the moment, most traditional banks around the world haven’t really got it sorted when it comes to mobile payments. Sure, they and the big card companies - the likes of Visa and Mastercard - might be working with Apple, Samsung and Google to facilitate access to their customers cards for contactless purposes. But this is just a partnership and is in no way allowing them to own the mobile payments solution or indeed, to monetise it.     Google, like many others, can see that at the moment, banks aren’t properly monetising mobile payments. They also know these banks are under pressure to meet data-security and second payment services directive (PSD2) regulation requirements - in Europe, at least. With trust in traditional banks declining and challenger banks becoming more popular, it must seem to Google - and many other disruptors - that it’s surely the perfect time to sweep in.    This new development is Google starting the process of making mobile payments easy to use and valuable for the masses. That is, everyone... the everyday consumer as well as online and offline merchants wanting a way to more simply (and more cheaply) take payments.  Google has millions of users. Millions of people already intimately familiar with the Google login process. Taking all these millions of users and allowing them to use the same login credentials to easily make payments isn’t a big leap. When Google is able to go to direct to account (the second payment services directive (PSD2) within Europe allows them to do this) it seems likely they will seek to autonomise this payments process - perhaps cutting out the cards companies and by association, the banks. As of January 2018, PSD2 regulation will allow bank API access to companies who have been granted an e-money license.  There is a huge - almost global - market ripe for disruption in the mobile payments space. The exception are places like Scandinavia. Banks in Scandinavia have created and monetised mobile payment solutions which facilitate all types of payments for every person - individuals and businesses. This means that the likes of Apple Pay, Android Pay and Samsung Pay haven’t yet been able to gain traction in the Nordics.  Right now, whilst banks in the rest of the world don’t yet have the same protection in place with their own robust mobile payment solutions, they do have a time advantage. They also have direct access to the customer. Combine this with experience and the ability - whether they realise it or not - to relatively quickly put in place a future-proof system prior to regulations, such as those outlined in PSD2, coming into effect.    Basically, until PSD2 comes into effect, all that third-parties like Apple Pay, Facebook - or indeed Google - can do is create a payment experience that works relatively similarly to what’s currently on offer. Until they can create innovative new experiences - and what is starting to happen is a hint of what is to come - customers are starting to losing interest.    Banks effectively have a choice to make now. Knowing they have a head start they could, like Nordic banks have done, invest heavily in delivering and monetising innovative mobile payment solutions that their customers want to use. If developed, delivered and marketed before their competition, who are no longer just other banks, gain traction and accounts are opened up - they are in a great position to retain relevance. Not only could they gain renewed relevance but alongside this, grow their customer base and their bottom line.    The alternatives include partnering with other banks to create a combined offering, strengthening partnerships with the card companies and hoping they will create a solution favourable to their existing relationship or… doing nothing and hoping for the best.    A recent EY survey recommended banks overhaul their consumer relationships strategy. Another report from PwC, Catalyst or Threat, concluded that European consumers were already au fait with digital payments, including mobile. This report also made reference to the fact that banking customers wanted to be able to use innovative third-party financial solutions. A bank could take from this: unless we do something - fast - our customers will leave.    Deals between banks and fintechs or big tech companies don’t ensure continued relevancy. Nor does the addition of simple technology - such as near-field communication, tap and go, contactless - without a bigger strategy around value-add for the customer and for the bank.  Many banks are still fixated on card payments. But in certain areas - like in China and the Nordics - app based mobile payments continue to quickly grow. This is because these solutions consider all payment situations. They make it easy to build eco-systems, receive payments and solve common issues. This fixation and the launching of variations of a technology which hasn’t fundamentally changed in decades - guarantees a huge amount of wasted money. Wasted money which could be 100 per cent better spent on providing customers with game-changing payment innovations.    Companies like Facebook and Google are now a bank’s biggest competitors and this will only intensify in the future. Banks can secure their position by simply becoming... a better bank. By listening to what customers want, developing fun and easy to use technology and knowing how to then monetise the resulting payment solutions is a sure-fire way to stay relevant - and profitable. So, my advice to banks is this: launch a system that your customers - and everyone in your market - actually needs and wants. Make it easy for individuals and business owners to pay and get paid - in any situation. Stop restricting, start facilitating.  Daniel Döderlein, CEO and founder of Auka Image Credit: Bloomicon / Shutterstock  Topics Security Cloud enterprise mobile payment Android Pay apple pay contactless payment GET YOUR FREE MAGAZINE NET: The Money Issue worth £5.99 Join over 7000 ITProPortal subscribers!

Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print Tech lambasts Trump Paris move By Li Zhou 06/02/2017 10:00 AM EDT With help from Margaret Harding McGill, Steven Overly, Ashley Gold and Nancy Scola TECH LAMBASTS TRUMP PARIS MOVE — The leaders of some of the country's biggest and most influential technology companies — including Tesla, Amazon, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Salesforce and IBM — expressed what one CEO called "deep disappointment" with President Donald Trump's Rose Garden announcement that the U.S. is withdrawing from the 2015 Paris climate agreement, Nancy and Steven report. Story Continued Below — Within moments of Trump wrapping his remarks, making formal the widely expected decision, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk tweeted that "Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world" and severed his ties with White House business advisory groups. An Amazon Twitter account said the company "continues to support the Paris climate agreement and action on climate change." Google CEO Sundar Pichai tweeted, "Disappointed with today's decision. Google will keep working hard for a cleaner, more prosperous future for all." — The litany of protests continued: Mark Zuckerberg said in a Facebook post that the president's decision is "bad for the environment, bad for the economy, and it puts our children's future at risk." Apple CEO Tim Cook tweeted the move is “wrong for our planet,” and said the iPhone giant is “committed to fight climate change and we will never waver.” Uber head of transportation policy and research Andrew Salzberg wrote a Medium post calling Trump’s decision a “huge disappointment.” IBM said it will continue to support the Paris agreement, but indicated CEO Ginni Rometty would remain on Trump’s advisory council. TRUMP ADMIN ASKS SUPREME COURT TO REINSTATE TRAVEL BAN — “President Donald Trump has asked the Supreme Court to revive his controversial travel ban executive order, hoping that the justices will give the green light to a policy repeatedly blocked by lower courts,” POLITICO’s Josh Gerstein reports. “In filings Thursday night, the Justice Department asked the high court to temporarily lift injunctions that bar officials from carrying out Trump’s directive to suspend visa issuance to citizens of six majority-Muslim countries and halt the flow of refugees to the U.S. from across the globe. The Trump administration also asked the justices to add the legality of the travel ban to the high court’s docket.” SNAPSHOT OF THE PUSH TO UPGRADE FEDERAL IT — For you visual learners, POLITICO Pro's DataPoint team is out with a neat new graphic showing how the various moving parts of the government-tech landscape — from the U.S. Digital Service to 18F to the new White House Office of American Innovation — fit together.

TESLA TERMINATES LOBBYING FIRM — 38 North Solutions will no longer lobby on behalf of Tesla, according to termination papers filed Thursday. The firm first registered as a lobbyist for the electric carmaker in October 2015 and has largely worked on energy storage issues. SOCIAL MEDIA VISA VETTING MOVES FORWARD — “The Trump administration has rolled out a new questionnaire for U.S. visa applicants worldwide that asks for social media handles for the last five years and biographical information going back 15 years,” Reuters reports. “The new questions, part of an effort to tighten vetting of would-be visitors to the United States, was approved on May 23 by the Office of Management and Budget despite criticism from a range of education officials and academic groups during a public comment period.” COURT DELAYS UHF DISCOUNT - The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, which is mulling a request from Free Press, Common Cause and other groups to block the implementation of the so-called UHF discount pending a judicial review, handed down an administrative stay Thursday. The discount, which effectively loosens the FCC's TV ownership rules, was scheduled to take effect June 5. In its order, court cautioned that the administrative hold is meant to "give the court sufficient opportunity to consider the emergency motion for stay pending review and should not be construed in any way as a ruling on the merits of that motion." Andrew Schwartzman, an attorney representing the groups appealing the FCC's order explained, "The court wants more time; it has no significance beyond that." The FCC, Sinclair Broadcast Group and other companies have opposed the stay request.

The company’s overall workforce is 63 percent white, 19 percent Asian, 7 percent Hispanic/Latino and 6 percent black. These numbers decline in its technical workforce, where 18 percent identify as female, 51 percent white, 38 percent Asian, 4 percent Hispanic/Latino and 2 percent black.

BROWSER ACT MEETINGS CONTINUE — Rep. Marsha Blackburn’s office had a busy week meeting with various groups on her proposed BROWSER Act, which would require tech companies like Google and Facebook as well as ISPs like Comcast and Charter to get opt-in permission from consumers before using their data for advertising purposes. One of those meetings was with Public Knowledge. Their take on the proposal? Any bill that moves forward must have an “understanding how you balance the need to give consumers choice and power over how their data is used,” PK Vice President Chris Lewis told MT. “We do believe that the backlash to the broadband privacy rules repeal at the FCC certainly got the attention of legislators.” — But does Public Knowledge like the bill? An article in The Boston Globe which dubs Blackburn “Internet Privacy’s New Champion,” drew PK’s ire for saying the group “praised” the bill. Public Knowledge rebutted that characterization in a statement, saying it’s still evaluating the proposed legislation.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Micro-LED Displays and new Flexible Fuel Cells on the Horizon may see Portable Devices go Days without Charging | Main | In an Effort to hurt iPhone 8 Sales in Korea, Samsung Plans to Flood the Local market with Refurbished Note 7s » June 02, 2017 The Tech World will be glued to Apple's WWDC Keynote looking for their Response to the Smart Home Speaker Device Craze   During the Google I/O developer conference we learned how they plan to advance the Google Assistant to work better at making transactions than Siri, introduced "proactive assistance" and made the Google Home device better for entertainment and working with your TV. They also introduced "Google Lens" which is bound to be a huge hit. The feature is set to kick-start Augmented Reality on the Pixel and other Android phones. A user could take a photo and with one click get information about it. You could be in Chicago taking a photo of the tallest building and in one click you'll see 'Willis Tower' labeled on your photo. Or you could be in a museum taking a photo of a favorite work and in one click it'll reveal the artist and other relevant information. This is what many are hoping that Apple will introduce at their WWDC event next week. Apple was granted a patent for exactly this task in January. This technology also extends to indoor location services.   Another cool Google Lens feature will allow you to take a photo of a poster of an upcoming event and in one click you could have access to Ticketmaster and details of the upcoming event. This might be something coming to the iPhone 8 and tied to Siri.   It's been reported on several times that Apple's intelligent speaker device to compete with devices from Amazon, Google, Microsoft and others is already in production with Inventec. So this is going to likely be one of the highlights at the WWDC event – or so we hope.   There's no doubt that the tech sector is obsessed with new trend and even startup Essential Products will enter this market this summer with their own digital assistant. Apple is definitely late to the table. Danielle Levitas of app researcher App Annie noted in a new Financial Times report that "In this case, it behoves Apple to be late as it allows it to learn from other companies' mis-steps in what is still a nascent field. It's too important for them to screw up. But if you do it late, you'd better be better."   With Apple's device reportedly due to arrive in the market this fall, it'll be 'show time' for Apple to prove that they've done it better or it'll be seen as just another me-too product or worse, a copycat.   Ben Bajarin, analyst at Silicon Valley researcher Creative Strategies told the Financial Times that for ""Right now, the perception is that Siri is the least good out of those out there, from Alexa to Google. They need to make sure people have the experience they expect from Apple with Siri or they run the risk of losing those consumers' trust."   In respect to a 'Google Lens' equivalent for the iPhone, Bajarin noted that "Adding new senses is of little value, though, if the iPhone's brain does not improve too. Mr Bajarin expects the next version of the phone's operating software to see fundamental changes. 'A heavy theme is going to be how the software is becoming more smart,' he says. 'It's a learning operating system that knows about you specifically. I expect a high level of personalization and customization, as it starts to become more proactively intelligent.' Of course Bajarin was using lingo from Google's I/O regarding Google Home with Google Assistant as noted in the Google I/O slide noted below.   The Financial Times last noted that "So far, Apple has limited third-party access to Siri to a handful of app categories, including communications (Facebook and Skype), ride-hailing services (Uber, Lyft and Didi), payments (PayPal and Square), tracking workouts and photo searches. Siri can also be used to control some smart-home devices such as lightbulbs and thermostats using Apple's HomeKit platform. Mr Cook says he tells Siri to turn on his lights and make the coffee every morning. Now that Apple and its developers have all had a chance to learn from that test group, many expect Siri will be opened up to a broader range of apps — not least to create more reasons for consumers to buy that "Siri speaker", which is expected to go on sale later in the year.   The WWDC keynote is only three days away and yet it'll seem like weeks for Apple fans who impatiently await the delivery of a very important keynote that will have us all hoping this segment of the market will be seriously addressed, and better yet, give their competition something to worry about.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Google confirms it will block bad ads in Chrome, starting in early 2018 Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/06/01 3:35pm PDTJun 1, 2017 83 Plus 1 on G+ 441 Share on Facebook 121 Share on Twitter Total Shares645 Applications Google News About two months ago, the Wall Street Journal reported that Google would add an ad-blocking feature into the Chrome web browser. Similar to AdBlock Plus' default setting, Chrome would block ads deemed unacceptable (such as pop-ups, auto-playing video ads, etc). Google has now confirmed this, and shared further details about how it will work. In a post on the company's blog, Google announced that it is joining the Coalition for Better Ads, an industry group attempting to improve online ads. The group has developed the Better Ads Standards, a list of guidelines for desktop and mobile ads based on comprehensive research. Ads deemed unacceptable include pop-ups, auto-playing video ads with sound, large sticky ads, and other common formats. In the post, Google confirmed that Chrome will soon not show ads, including those served by Google, on websites not in compliance with the Better Ads Standards. The change will take effect in "early 2018." This is huge news, especially considering that Google serves more online ads than any company on Earth. Now that Chrome has approximately 60% of the desktop browser market share (and growing), sites will likely have no choice than to follow the guidelines.

Can get rid of those annoying app install ads when browsing on the phone! Corbin Davenport Yeah, I think those are included, since they stick to the top while scrolling. Mgamerz Great news, but I guarantee you there's going to be a shitstorm headed their way really quick. Corbin Davenport Oh for sure. Something something free market. bekifft This is huge. However if they don't address the issue of deceptive ads, it's still a big problem. Hopefully one day I can finally in good conscience stop installing ad blockers as simply a security measure to protect my users. Corbin Davenport I haven't looked through all of the standard's documentation, but I don't see anything about deceptive ads. But I agree, that should be addressed. My1 not really android related but when these things like get 10000 euro in a month easily show up in SKYPE, an application by MICROSOFT that hurts, and they even have HTTPS ads with certificate errors Eli Stevens I get the job done from convenience of my place, with very simple projects that only needs only from you a Desktop computer system as well as web connection and I am happier than before...

"Which giant 'Download Here' button is the right one?! Oh, of course, it's the tiny text link buried between three of them." Santos Chavez Ugh, I hate those sites with a passion. They're part of the reason i vehemently block ads. Take your stupid large fake green buttons outta here, filths :3 Adriannacsmith Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Cat Astrophy Deceptive is extremely hard to deal with and far more subjective. "Bad" can be virus ridden, or employing technical methods that can be detected automatically (like pop ups). Gregory Will there be an option to block all ads without exceptions? Corbin Davenport Most likely not. Artem Russakovskii Sort of, but if you subscribe to sites running Funding Choices and use Contributor to buy an ad-free pass. Which is how it should be if you want to enjoy quality content from creators. Good ads and free if you don't. No ads and small fee if you do. Bimmer Ime or you can install an adblocker and enjoy no ads and no fee :) Tom Westrick And the sites you enjoy won't be able to sustain themselves... Nathan J Are they hurting now? Because that's what we have now. We have ad blockers, and we have ABP with its acceptable ads, but a lot of people turn it off. How about the sack on that guy, telling the main guy at AP to block ads on his own site? I'm a block-everything guy too, but I'm going to be seriously looking into this Funding Choices thing. I don't want my ad-free page views being wasted on just any old site, but sites I read daily, like AP and Neowin, I definitely want to see them get their cut. Cakefish ABP allows through Taboola, Outbrain and Revcontent. The polar opposite of acceptable ads. R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ That would kill the internet and you would have to pay for everything. Ads are what make the internet free Gregory You know, they can always make money on others, not on me. Most people don't bother blocking ads, they simply don't care. Mark Curtis Yeah gimme free entertainment, but YOU foot the bill! David The internet was in fact a much *worse* place before ads became a thing. All the nice stuff you have access to now only exists because of ad revenue (email, YouTube, any and all social networking platforms) Toys Samurai He reminds me of some people whom I know -- always say they hate ads and would rather pay for it. But when the content provider actually asks for money, they don't open up their wallets. Jorgen Phillips This is the most hippocritical thing I think I have ever read. Toys Samurai Exactly. This very site he's reading would not even exist if everyone blocks ads. David That's not true, they could just use a different monetization model. Nathan J Hypocritical. You may be thinking of the hippocratic oath, where the famous phrase "do no harm" comes from. If only ads would pledge to do no harm... abc You can pay for it and I'll coast for free. Ha ha, I'm a dick! Nathan J There already is. That's what we have now. I mean, we have the no ad blocker option, which is default. Then you have Adblock Plus's default setting, which whitelists ads ABP considers to be not malicious. And that's what Google is doing. Then you have ABP with that feature turned off, or something like uBlock Origin, that just blocks all the ads indiscriminately. This is a future measure that is designed to be more tolerant than current "all or nothing" solutions, plus Google is an advertising business. So, there probably won't be. Eddy Nelson Lopez They profit from it, why would they do it? 😂😂 Corbin Davenport They won't profit from it if a majority of users have an ad blocker. Which is where things are headed right now. exadeci They can blocks ads from everyone except theirs and having the most popular browser they can sell the exclusivity to other ad agencies. Corbin Davenport "In the post, Google confirmed that Chrome will soon not show ads, including those served by Google, on websites not in compliance with the Better Ads Standards." exadeci Couldn't they just prevent bad ads on their platform?! Imparus The problem is how you serve them to the user. If you create a popup filled with Google ads, it would be bad ads even thought they are Google approved ads. exadeci Right but if they can detect it in Chrome why can't they use this to disable the ads on the website that abuses it? Sonny Bono I'm guessing it's a preventative measure, seeing how many people get virused through some popup ads that they don't realize are a pathway to malicious software. We certainly don't want another epidemic of ransomware. I find most of my service calls go to elderly people who have no idea what they're doing and get tons of malware/ransomware. One old lady I was working with a few weeks ago actually "called microsoft" per the directions on her browser and gave them her credit card number. It wasn't really microsoft. abqnm As long as it takes care of the shady JavaScript click event pop-unders and other such js deceptive ad techniques which are generally not able to be caught by ad-blockers. I would really love to be able to go back to having JavaScript enabled and blacklist only certain sites rather than have to keep it disabled and whitelist the majority of my internet experience. TW Does this mean my phone won't connect constantly start vibrating because of ads on legitimate sites? raazman I'm sorry you have to experience this is this day and age. AintaDamnThingFunny This!! I've always wondered how those got through Chrome's security. I mean, it's an obtrusive add that makes your phone vibrate, and all you can do is close out the browser. How the hell do those get through and how has Google not stopped this from happening? Imparus Because a website can access the vibrator API, this is useful in the example of facebook, where you can activate notification for the site, and not having to use their shitty app. TW Now I know what to call the thing I hate: Vibrator API Total Insecurity For some reason female users like this API... BRO i prefer my phone silent, no notification sound or vibration, as i mostly use my pc with pushbullet mirroring My1 what the hell, how about they just pop a notif and let the phone do the rest? Imparus Okay so it was a bad example with facebook, since it is the notification API they are using not the vibration one, which means it follows the same rules as other applications. I should just have said a game might use it, but at the moment it is mainly used for BS ads. My1 okay, but I see no point in point in using the vibration on a website anyway. Imparus PWA, I mentioned game, since PWA is one of the new thing that is very likely to become huge in the next few years. Here you can try some few application made in it https://pwa.rocks/ so it is more that you should be ready for a paradigm change in what a website is, since the line between webapp and normal app will almost disappear. Example I use the QR scanner, so I don't have to have a dedicated app for it. My1 well honestly I think the PWA stuff is taking it too far, especially games, I mean dont they run better when compiled and optimized for an OS? also websites are supposed to work on any device that has a more or less modern browser and when games need for example multitouch, that thing is not really funny on a device without touch, since I cant summon a second mouse arrow. and when websites are starting to lose the point of working pretty much everywhere and becoming a gimmick it's starting to get stupid. especially if you have a bad internet connection these PWAs arent as great as when you just have your application. with the browser opening more and more, it's seriously going to risk opening itself to viruses and stuff Imparus I unfortunately don't have the time at the moment to explain all of these to you, so this will be quick rundown, and the rest you will have to research yourself if you are interested in it. "well honestly I think the PWA stuff is taking it too far, especially games, I mean dont they run better when compiled and optimized for an OS? " For most stuff it isn't a problem at all, as for game if they are simple enough optimization isn't as relevant. Most game would be written for an engine like unity or unreal, and one of the new thing in relation to PWA are modules, that will allow the use of engine like that, it also allow webapps to work completely offline. There will of course be some apps that are very heavy in computation on device that will make sense to run with native code that can run better, but there are being worked on optimizing things such as JS to make it run faster. "also websites are supposed to work on any device that has a more or less modern browser and when games need for example multitouch, that thing is not really funny on a device without touch, since I cant summon a second mouse arrow." You can have the browser serve different code depending on the device, that actually isn't anything new. "and when websites are starting to lose the point of working pretty much everywhere and becoming a gimmick it's starting to get stupid. " PWA actually allow apps to work everywhere, instead of just the OS you coded it to. Having one single code base would be great for pretty much every company. "especially if you have a bad internet connection these PWAs arent as great as when you just have your application." You can easily code for it to work offline, take the QR scanner on the side I linked you, I don't need internet to use it at all. Think of PWA like normal apps, if you use twitter then try using the PWA they have created. "with the browser opening more and more, it's seriously going to risk opening itself to viruses and stuff" Not really, this is one of the thing I will say you need to research yourself, since it will be quite a long explanation, I would start by looking into why chromeOS is more secure than Windows. I said there will be a huge grow with PWA over the next few years, since it is still very early in its development, only Firefox and Chrome support it at the moment and Edge will bring support in fall. AintaDamnThingFunny Right, but websites always ask me for permission if I want their notifications. Facebook using the vibrator API with your permission is one thing. Having an obtrusive add use it without your permission is another. Imparus That is because a website don't need to ask for permission, so it is more that Google should make it a permission check before allowing to use the vibration. Santos Chavez OMG I hate those types of ads! Especially when the ads that popup are so obstrusive I can't do anything but exit Chrome. Ugh! Rob Yeah, but some people love the vibrator API. hooch Holy shit I didn't even know this was a thing. Been using Firefox + uBlock Origin for a couple of years. blindexecutioner Doesn't affect me much. I already block ads. Nathan J It's not meant to affect you or I or anyone else who knows what uBlock Origin is. Google Chrome is the most popular browser, so I imagine what it will affect is the 60% or however many people use Chrome, and all of a sudden they're blocking malicious ads. That will affect a lot. I suspect for you and I, we will probably be able to just disable Google's solution and use our own, and if Google blocks other ad blockers, there's always Chromium. AS The biggest annoyances for me are subscribe popovers and EU cookie warnings. Things like taboola and outbrain need to be aggressively blocked. My1 cookie warning are annoying but it shows the scary relatity of all the sites that collect data with cookies. Lateef Alabi-Oki I'll disable my ad blocker if this gets rid of malicious and egregious ads. Nexus Hexus I'm sure most of these "Bad ads" will be alternative media. Or aka "Whatever we don't agree with" boop It's not content that's blocked, but format. Sonny Bono Ironically, all the ads that I find bothersome are on google services themselves, such as YouTube, but I have a Chrome extension (ublock origin) that works to get rid of them. Santos Chavez I enjoy YouTube so much, I pay for YouTube Red, via the Google Play Music Family Plan . Haven't seen an ad, especially on mobile. for months, and I get unlimited music streaming and downloading, all of those features shared to 5 other users. Pretty neat. Sonny Bono If they throw in free movies with the service I'd be down. I can already get anything I want on demand for no cost. I just appreciate watching random videos and I never know what I'm in the mood for. I'll just keep riding the links down the chain, bar tricks, gun porn, rocket engines, science experiments, old computers, animals and hunting videos... whatever it might be. ublock origin fixes the problem with ads - they don't exist any more - but not with popup windows on some questionable websites. abc Good for you. I use an adblocker and don't see any ads on Youtube. And I don't feel bad taking cents away from a multi-billion dollar corporation. I will never pay for streaming services because I like to own things. I could pay Netflix hundreds of dollars over the course of years, and the moment I disconnect, I am left with zero movies. I'd much rather grab some discs from the bargain bin. Gary But do they block those annoying as hell forced Google surveys? Adam Margeson Forced Google surveys? Where are you seeing those served up? And, are you sure they're legitimately from Google? Lord Argyris "...Google confirmed that Chrome will soon not show ads, including those served by Google, on websites not in compliance with the Better Ads Standards." I'm going to guess they're including their own ads here to avoid anticompetitive suits from competing ad providers. If they just blocked the other ads and left their own (presumably compliant ads), they would be gaining an unfair advantage and could be seen to be leveraging their strength in the browser market to incentivize use of their own ad platform. I wondered about this in my comment on the previous AP article on the subject, and it seems Google has considered the matter as well. Santos Chavez Yeah, it's kinda neat; by doing it that way Google avoids all sorts of blames of being hypocrites while also setting the example for everyone. "THIS", they say, "is how ads should be done. Look, we're even doing them to our own; you should, too". Terra Remove the ads that play before a video and we got a deal. Small banners below the video? Ok. Playing a commercial before the content I actually want to see? That is old tv bullcrap and is annoying as hell, even more so than popups. Dennis Ulijn "But, but, but... Terra: how would you solve this on Chromecast, etc.?" tigerberry Playing a commercial WHILE PLAYING THE DAMN VIDEO I'M ACTUALLY WATCHING? Whoever came up with that should be forced to never use an adblocker ever again. Cakefish Wonderful. Please also add extension support to Android Chrome (it's the number 1 feature that it's missing, desktop Chrome wouldn't have been as popular without it) but this is a good start. Ghirahim Install Opera and have a wonderful life. Jun rip pornhub ads Rod I wonder when they will fix the Notification Download Service bug in v58. https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=719641# Rob Thank goodness. Somehow, we went from doing away with auto-play videos and ads years ago, only to have them pop up a lot in recent months. I'm sick of them. BC Google is finally making a move that I truly approve of. Ads, especially the invasive ones have really taken over. I don't care about banner ads that I see just once or ads on the side. The ones that infuriate me the most are those that obscure content, automatically play loud sounds/videos. Those that try to trick the user into installing something they don't obviously need, need to die in a fire. It's why I've installed Ghostery and use Mercury Reader to banish that bullshit to the depths of the internet hell. I'm also pleased that Google is being smart about this and blocking all invasive content...Even if it comes directly from their company because they need to be impartial and control these insanely bad adverts. Forcing a standard will hopefully make the internet a cleaner place, one that can support the advert model without being deliberately invasive or deceptive. Dragos Lucian The only thing that makes me use an adblocker on a lot of websites, is because, more often than not, you don't even need to click on the ads to be presented with a buttload of new tabs or individual pages. You just need to click on a blank area and boom ! You can barely make your way back to the page you initially were. If those type of ads go away, then I'll make sure to uninstall my adblocker. Till then, fuck everyone who posts those type of ads on their websites in order to gain revenue. Make your money off selling socks. Abhishek Mittal Does this mean my phone wont start buzzing and downloading unwanted apps without my permission? This is huge, a great step by google in improving quality of the internet Spinkick Does it bother anyone that google is the one that decides which ads are bad? abc Google means that they are going to block their competitors ads and only allow their own.

I spent a few weeks playing with the Huawei Watch 2, and so far, I am very pleased with the device. Powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 2100 with 768 MB of RAM and 4GB storage, both devices feature a 1.2 inch AMOLED 390×390 display and a 420 mAh battery. Featuring Android Wear 2.0, the Huawei Watch 2 offers a sporty design while the Watch 2 Classic delivers an elegant look with interchangeable leather bands and a stainless body. The Watch 2 international versions come with 4G LTE connectivity. Both devices are available since April 18th and May 28th, the non-4G sporty looking Watch 2 for $299.99 and the Watch 2 Classic for $369.99The Watch 2 comes in Carbon Black and Concrete Grey, the Watch 2 Classic is available in Titanium Grey. Read the complete article to get a sense of my first impressions after wearing the Huawei Watch 2 for a few weeks in various situations. Specifications Product weight 57 g Dimension 48.9 x 45 x 12.6 mm (1.93 x 1.77 x 0.50 in) Display Type2″-inch AMOLED Resolution 320 x 320 pixels, (326 ppi) Diagonal2-inch (circle) Processor Snapdragon Wear 2100 – Quad-core 1.1 GHz OS Android Wear 2.0 Camera No Connectivity WiFi 802.11 b, g, n / Bluetooth 4.1 LE / NFC Network: 4G LTE international model only not in the U.S. – nano SIM or e-SIM Internal storage 4GB RAM 768 MB Battery Capacity 420mAh – about 2 days in regular mode Sensors: Gyro/ Accelerometer/ Compass, PPG (heart rate monitor), Barometer, GPS, NFC Dust and Water Resistance IP68 (- IP68 certified – dust/water proof over 1.5 meter and 30 minutes –  Water resistant up to 1 meter and 30 minutes) Huawei Watch 2 Color: Dynamic Orange, Carbon Black, Concrete Grey Huawei Watch 2 Classic: silver with leather band Speaker / Microphone What’s New? Huawei announced its first Huawei Watch powered by Android Wear at MWC in March 2015, and it was one of our preferred Android Wear Watch alongside the LG Watch Urbane 2nd gen. Compared to its predecessor, the Huawei Watch, the main differences are the SoC and the Operating system: the new Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 2100 (vs. Snapdragon 400) with 768 MB RAM (vs. 512 MB), and Android Wear 2.0. The Huawei Watch 2 is IP68 dust and water resistant, an upgrade from the IP67 rating for the previous version. The international model gets 4G connectivity with a tiny SIM card slot hidden behind one of the removable band – we have the WiFi-only model so I could not shoot a photo. The Watch 2 features an integrated GPS now, which allows users to get rid of their phone when running outdoors and still being able to records the distance, and navigate trails. Compared to the previous model, the Huawei Watch 2 features an additional physical button, to access the new Workout menu. Display (Excellent) The 1.2 -inch 390×390 AMOLED display is smaller than the previous mode (1.4-inch), and delivers a great image quality with deep blacks and gorgeous colors. The body-to-screen ratio could be better, in fact, the large bezel could be thinner to make room for a larger display encased in the same chassis, or reduce the total size of the body, which would look more elegant on my small wrist. Industrial design (Very Good) The quite large bezel with the seconds is merely a design element to make the device look like a traditional sports watch, and nothing else.The Watch 2 is about 5 mm larger than the Huawei Watch, probably to contain the new components, the chassis is made of mixed plastic for the sports version while the new Classic gets a combination of stainless steel and plastic. On the right side, two physical buttons faster access to the new the user interface, the menu can be operated with the touch screen as well. As Android 2.0 supports a digital crown, it would have been great to get that feature for scrolling through the apps on the menu. Swiping across the display with the finger is sometimes painful, especially during workout sessions when you are constantly moving around. You can remove the 20 mm band made of mixed plastic, which is quite comfortable on the wrist. The watch is easy to put on, even with my very small wrist. Software – Android Wear 2.0 user interface Android Wear 2.0 was unveiled for the first time at Google I/O 2016, one year ago, and you can see a short video demo below of the main new features (on a different smartwatch): With Android 2.0 your watch does not need your phone anymore, after connecting your wearable device directly to WiFi and adding your Google account, you can download apps from the PlayStore app directly from your Android Wear 2.0 smartwatch. You can search the PlayStore from the watch using voice commands. One of the main changes in the 2.0 version is the new app launcher, which can be accessed with the top button on the Huawei Watch 2, and browsed using the touch screen. Quick access to settings, battery status, sound, display on/off, plane mode, is available by swiping down the home screen. The home screen with the watch face can be customized to display data from various apps, such as the heart rate sensor, the workout data, the phone app, the calendar and much more. The data (such as the calendar events or the heart rate) from the apps are displayed as “complications” on the home screen, you can change complications by long pressing on the watch face, and selecting the one you want. To learn how to customize the watch face with the data you want, see this page. Workout  Modes (Very Good) For the workout, I performed my usual routine: indoor bicycle and weight lifting. Accessing the workout programs is pretty easy, the bottom button on the side provides direct access to the fitness menu where you can select from five preset exercises: run, fat burning, cardio, walk, outdoor bicycle, treadmill, Indoor bicycle, other and training plan. Weight lifting is not on the list, but you can use “other,” and the device will monitor your heart rate continuously during the session. To start the session, tap on the icon, and to end it simply tap on the screen, a pause and play icons will appear, tap on the pause button. A standalone Android-powered sports watch with a GPS, and 4GB internal memory, is fantastic for runners: you can record the entire outdoors running session with the GPS and using the workout run mode, while listening offline to your favorite music from Google Play. Since I do not really run, I have not tested how the Huawei Watch 2 behave while running. Heart Rate (Very Good – sometimes needs to wipe the sweat) Over the three workout sessions I performed with the Watch 2, I tested the heart rate sensor against the indoor bicycle pulse sensor placed on the handles. Typically, cardio measurements are more accurate when done at the tip of the fingers or the ears, rather than from the wrist, the most accurate heart rate monitors are the one you strap to your chest. Overall, the measurements were similar, except for a little lag in accuracy when the heart rate starts increasing in the first moments of the warm up. The indoor bicycle pulse monitor tends to be more responsive than the watch, which displays the same number with about 30 seconds to 1-minute lag. On two instances, when my wrist was wet, the measurements looked far off, which was the case for the other smartwatch I was trying as well, the Steel. After quickly wiping the optical sensor, the numbers were back to normal. To my knowledge, most consumer-grade optical HR sensors tend to have this problem with sweat: it is hard to get an accurate reading when the LED is covered with water (or sweat). Workout recording (Very Good) My routine workout starts with 10 to 15 minutes indoor cycling, before an hour of weight lifting and abs. That type of workout is not listed yet because it would require a more precise motion detection and RFID tags read by the watch to detect the weights. For this review, I selected “other” for the weight lifting sessions. During the workout, I could easily read the data, and afterward, all my workouts were still stored in the watch for review. The exercise history is also accessible in the Huawei Health companion application which is different from the Huawei Wear app that you need to connect the device to your phone ( go figure). There you access the charts, including heart rate and pace, and the maps of your walks or runs. In the details screen, you get the data as a list: distance, duration, calories, avg. heart rate, steps, avg pace, avg speed, avg steps/min, stride length, training results, impact level (low to high), and the recovery time needed to the next workout. You get almost the same information in the watch, displayed differently: first the training effect with the heart zones in color with impact level, then the list described above, then the heart chart, then the heart zones chart (extreme, anaerobic, aerobic, fat burning, warm-up) and the map of your trajectory. Google Assistant (very good) Google Assistant is one of the new features introduced with Android Wear 2.0, and you can use it on a number of Android-powered devices, including smartphones, Android Auto compatible cars, and Google Home, the competitor of Amazon Echo powered by Alexa. To get a sense of the embedded assistant, I tried the usual simple voice commands such as “ok Google, what is the weather today?”, “who is the Brazilian president” “how many people in Indonesia”, “go to the Moscone Center”, “what is my next appointment?” “what is my next meeting?” “listen the news? All the voice commands were perfectly understood, however, while most of the commands got me an satisfying answer back, none of the calendar requests worked on the watch, while Google assistant could reply to “what is my next meeting”, from my Android 7-powered smartphone, but could not get an answer with the word “appointment”. All the commands asking for a location triggered Google maps and displayed the ETA (estimated time of arrival), however, the Google Maps application needs to be installed on the watch to automatically starts the navigation, otherwise, you need to tap “open on the phone” to start it and view it both on your phone and your watch. “listen to the news” failed on the watch (triggered music on the phone), while it worked on my Samsung Galaxy S8. The “Ok Google” command that launch Google Assistant worked perfectly for almost all the commands. Long pressing the top button was the best way to access the assistant. The Ok Google command has regularly troubles to work with any version of Android. For instance, it was impossible to train my Galaxy S8 to train to recognize my Ok Google command in the Google app settings. Navigation (excellent) The navigation feature is great, you can trigger it using Google assistant’s voice activation and simply say “ok Google, walk to <address>” if you want the pedestrian route or “ok Google, navigate to <address>” if you want the vehicle route. The system is more intelligent than in the previous Android Wear version, and it still understands foreign accents in English pretty well – we have tried all that. As the previous Android Wear updated version, you will feel a subtle vibration on your wrist that signals the upcoming turn. Phone calls (excellent) You can place and receive calls directly on the watch, when you are in range with your phone. The sound quality is good, when I  tried it, the voice of my correspondent was clear.   Notifications and Reply (excellent) I received my emails notifications, and I could read them and reply using preset replies such as “yes”, “no”, “ok”, “thanks”, “let me get back to you” and more. I could also use voice commands to dictate a response or type it from the embedded keyboard (far more difficult but doable). Google Music and Music Playback (good) Huawei offers 10 free weeks of Google Play music in the US, so we tried the feature during the briefing last week. Thanks to the speaker you can listen directly from the watch (we tried this during the briefing a the gym session), however, for better quality, you can always use wireless headphones. In case you are outdoors without WiFi networks available, you can download and store your playlists in the watch’s 4GB internal memory. Other music services – Spotify not yet fully supported on the Watch Since I have a Spotify account I tried to use it. The app is available to download from the watch using the Google Play icon. With Spotify, you can only remote control your music from the watch and play it on your connected smartphone, no offline mode accessible and no playlist playable directly from the watch yet. Connectivity (do not use with multiple phones, just like other Android Wear watches) The Huawei Watch 2 was connected to an LG V20 at the beginning of the review, then that phone was stolen during one of my business trips, and I tried to connect it to my old Samsung Galaxy Note 5, without success. Please note that I am using the Withings Steel HR simultaneously, with a different companion app on the phone. Then I switched to the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus, and I could not even see the Watch 2 in the Bluetooth screen, while the Steel HR, which is not powered by Android Wear, was visible and paired. After a factory reset, the Huawei Watch 2 was visible instantly both in the Bluetooth screen and in the Android Wear application, and the pairing was fast and easy. IMPORTANT: This happened to me with other Android Wear smartwatches, so it is probably related to the software and might be an extra security layer in case you lose your watch, to force the new user to reset your data. My advice: always sync you watch before switching phone, so all the data will be saved in your companion apps in the phone: Android Wear, Huawei Wear, and Google Fit. Battery The Huawei offers two battery mode accessible from the main menu under the battery app. In Watch Mode, a feature unique to Huawei, you can get up to 3 weeks of usage on a single charge. When in watch mode you cannot access all the features, but the device keeps counting steps and displays time. In regular mode, with multiple GPS trips, a few phone calls, and no workout, I got a little more than 2 days. The battery decreased by 6% after a one-hour workout without any workout mode, and by 10% when set in workout mode for an hour. Please note that this US model does not offer 4G connectivity and an LTE cellular model could have a shorter battery life. According to the manufacturer, when continuously training mode, with both the heart rate sensor and GPS on, the device lasts up to 10 hours. Conclusion (Very Good) While I need to test more features, so far the Huawei Watch 2 lived up to my expectations, providing a great experience for everyday usage. I am a big fan of using Google assistant, a feature of Android Wear 2.0 to access all kinds of features, and specifically, to operate the navigation on Google maps directly on the watch using more intelligent voice commands. The display is gorgeous, and it is easy to access the main menu or the workout menu using the two physical buttons. The Watch Mode option of the battery is brilliant, in case you just need to use the device as a regular watch with a pedometer, then you will get three weeks of usage on a single charge.

In other advertising and marketing channels, the picture isn’t as clear for attribution of the budget to direct results. When you send your PPC traffic to dedicated landing pages and track it all the way to conversion using Google Analytics, you’re able to clearly see what you spent and what it drove in terms of your end goals. No billboard or magazine ad can attribute to sales like that. 3. Quick Entry Even if you’re a decade behind your competitors on jumping into PPC marketing, you can get up and running quickly with a little bit of optimization. This is often a big contrast to starting up SEO efforts, which often take a lot of time and attention to get the same type of positioning and traffic that AdWords offers within minutes of launch. When compared to other channels like email and organic social, you have the advantage of targeting people outside of those who are already aware of your brand, and you aren’t limited to your existing followers or customer lists. PPC lets you quickly cast a wide net to find new prospects and customers. Plus, most of the work is done within the PPC advertising platform — from the research to campaign build out, to writing ads. You can get up and running quickly with minimal involvement of your development teams, aside from help setting up conversion tracking and any desired landing pages. 4. You’re in Control While there are several nuances regarding default campaign settings, you ultimately have control over a wide range of options for how you reach potential customers. This starts with the keywords or placements you choose to target and how restrictive you want to be. You also have a lot of budget flexibility if you want to start small. You can can set your own ad budget and bids, and choose what you’re willing to spend (though you have to pay at least close to a market rate to play in most cases). If you’re seeing positive results, you can scale up immediately. And if you want to take a break, you can always pause and stop your ad spend right away. This is hard to do with other ongoing marketing campaigns, giving you the advantage and budget flexibility to move quickly when necessary or desired. Google’s AdWords auction and the algorithm involved has the final say as to where your ads will be positioned and what you’ll spend when compared to competitors. The alignment of relevance between your landing pages and the keywords and ad copy can hurt or help you. The good news is that you have the flexibility to make quick edits and to optimize while your ads are running, and to try new tests every day if you wish. There’s not a long cycle from edit to deployment that you see in other mediums, and if an ad stinks, you can pull it without having to let it finish out a contracted media cycle. 5. PPC Works Well With Other Marketing Channels Content marketing has taken over the digital marketing world and content plans and calendars are the norm in most businesses now. With the investment in producing original and unique content to support the customer buying cycle and establish thought leadership positioning, AdWords is an engine that can drive visitors to content more quickly and improve the ROI on your content investment. PPC and SEO work well together as the impressions and opportunities for traffic are often to the same audience — the people using Google to find information, services, or products. The performance data of impressions, clicks, and conversions from AdWords can provide great insight and direction on a keyword-by-keyword basis for where to prioritize SEO efforts. On the flip side, organic traffic performance data and SEO strategy can also advise PPC if the data is available. All of this helps align with content marketing and ensures that efficiencies are gained and business end goals are not siloed. AdWords remarketing is a great avenue to keep site visitors engaged, regardless of how they found your site. Remarketing ads are shown to people who visited and left your site and are based on specific rules or audiences you select. There are other cases where PPC can help provide data or an alternative to traditional direct marketing activities. PPC can also be directly compared to traditional mail with costs per impression and conversion. If you can shift away from more expensive traditional marketing to methods that provide real-time data and have better tracking, it can be a big win. 6. Incredible Targeting Options Many advertisers take a multi-layered approach in AdWords to test and ensure full coverage across the networks and targeting types that can gain brand exposure. This ranges from targeting keywords through text ads, to running ads through remarketing based on their past behaviors, or focusing on specific audience demographics on the display network. By testing and trying out a mix, you can ensure the full scope of AdWords is leveraged and that you’re getting as many impressions as possible while staying targeted to the personas in your prospective audience. Going back to the business goals conversation, you can also see what performs best and set expectations on what the tolerance is for cost per click and cost per acquisition to compare the different targeting methods with each other. Ultimately, the biggest benefit of the PPC targeting options available is that you are able to reach people who aren’t already in your audience as well as those that have been exposed to your brand. You have many options for how wide of a net you want to cast. 7. A Wealth of Marketing Data While there’s a lot of data and performance information directly available in Google AdWords, the value of information gained goes beyond just PPC performance. Impression, click, and conversion data for each keyword can be used to advise SEO strategy and content marketing efforts. Beyond that, you can use the built-in keyword planner and display planner tools to find where your audience is. You can also cross-reference where your competition is through third-party tools like SpyFu, KeywordSpy, and iSpionage to build a solid profile of what you’re up against and what market share you can gain. Is Your Boss or Client Still on the Fence? Run your own projection to show the risk of AdWords compared to other organic and paid sources of traffic you’re currently utilizing. For example: By looking at what the cost will be for media, management of the campaign, and any content that must be created, you can put that cost up against what you’re currently spending for similar management and development activities in organic search, email, social, and offline marketing channels. Additionally, you can take some simple inputs including your current or projected conversion rate and project with the keyword and display planner tools to see what traffic is out there. From there, you can look at what the projection is if you were to increase by certain amounts of traffic, putting the cost of that traffic against the investment required to get it. Summary PPC advertising has proven to be a reliable and profitable channel for tons of B2B, B2C, nonprofits, and other companies seeking quick, quality traffic and conversions. Considering all the benefits PPC offers, there’s little risk in testing it out to see where it can move the needle and to gain a wealth of valuable data you can use to inform you other marketing and optimization efforts.

The company, of course, will ensure its ads don't fall foul of the rules. “It's far too common that people encounter annoying, intrusive ads on the web – like the kind that blare music unexpectedly, or force you to wait 10 seconds before you can see the content on the page,” wrote Sridhar Ramaswamy, Google’s senior vice president of ads and commerce, in a blog post.  “These frustrating experiences can lead some people to block all ads – taking a big toll on the content creators, journalists, web developers and videographers who depend on ads to fund their content creation.” Google’s ad blocker will only target adverts that the Coalition for Better Ads – a group Google is a member of – considers to be “unacceptable”.  For mobile users, the Coalition for Better Ads says pop-up ads, prestitial ads (those that block the content you actually want to access by loading first), pages with more than 30 per cent ad density, flashing animations, poststitial ads that require a countdown to dismiss, full-screen rollover ads, large sticky ads and auto-playing videos with sound are “least preferred”. On desktop, the “least preferred” list includes cut to pop-up ads, auto-playing videos with sound, prestitial ads with a countdown and large sticky ads. Publishers can find out if their ads are compliant by using the Ad Experience Report, which is designed to help them spot and fix issues.

How to rank for ‘position 0’ in 3 simple steps: A featured snippets primer What is a featured snippet, and how can you position your content to rank for one? Columnist Stephan Spencer explains this search feature and provides tips for optimizing your pages for it. Stephan Spencer on June 2, 2017 at 9:36 am More For many site owners, ranking in position 1 is the holy grail of SEO. However, if you are in a competitive market, achieving that coveted first position in the Google SERPs (search engine results pages) may take a lot of effort and investment. I’m not saying you shouldn’t make the investment, but don’t overlook the opportunity to rank in position 0 with a featured snippet. For one thing, getting a featured snippet may be less about the link metrics and more about the actual content on your page. So if you are outgunned in terms of backlinks, then featured snippets could be just the thing for your business. Surprisingly, it is not unheard of for URLs ranking on page 2 of the Google SERPs to get a “position 0” result with a featured snippet. Of course, most featured snippets are for URLs that are in the top 10 results. As you can imagine, if you are in position 5, getting that position 0 “answer box” result can be a big boost to that page’s visibility and organic traffic. What’s a featured snippet? At this writing, featured snippets appear in 9.1968 percent of search queries, according to RankRanger. They appear at the top of the search results page, above the normal search results (hence the reason we call these “position 0” rankings). The snippet contains the URL and page title, along with a “snippet” of the page’s content in an attempt to answer the searcher’s query. The way it works is that Google will “programmatically detect pages that answer the user’s question, and display a top result as a featured snippet in the search results.” These featured snippets are designed to draw the user’s attention, and many site owners find that their CTR (click-through rate) significantly increases for the web pages that have featured snippets in the SERPs. Featured snippet examples There are many different types of featured snippets; here are some examples of the most common types. By far the most common type of featured snippet is the paragraph type: The list type of featured snippet is often shown for “process” search queries that are looking for a series of steps to accomplish a task. Note that the example below also includes an illustrative image. For getting the table type of featured snippet, your best bet is to mark up the table on your page using the <table> tag. So, how can you snag this coveted spot in the SERPs? Read on for advice. Step 1: Understanding the opportunity for your site When it comes to featured snippets, not all markets are created equal. If you are a local business, a better use of your time would be to focus on positioning your business for the Google map results, as featured snippets are not seen in SERPs that display the local pack (according to a study done by Stat Search Analytics). On the flip side, if you are in a market where there is a need for clear answers to frequently asked questions, your industry uses terms that need explanation, and/or you have data that can be presented in tabular format, then featured snippets are likely a great opportunity for you. In the aforementioned study, Stat reviewed 92,000 search queries for featured snippets and found the types of search terms which often return featured snippets are: financial mathematical time transitional status requirements health DIY processes The types of searches which rarely return featured snippets are: local info/help factual shopping images and videos Stat did a refresh of their study six months later and found something surprising. One category of searches moved from rarely returning featured snippets to commonly returning featured snippets, and that was subjective queries (e.g., “best” or “reviews” included in the query). While it’s tempting to jump into keyword research right away to find question-oriented keywords, you should first check whether your site is ranking with featured snippets today. Keep in mind, just because you have the snippet today doesn’t mean you will next week, so you’ll definitely want to track your position 0 rankings. Additionally, matching up Google Search Console CTR data with the keywords for which you have featured snippets also helps you size the opportunity, especially if you can compare CTR data for a time frame when you had the featured snippet against a time frame when you did not. Even if your site does not have any featured snippets, a review of your competitors’ featured snippets will be instructive to give you a starting point for a list of keywords you might want to focus on. Fortunately, there are a few tools available that can help you find keywords that currently have featured snippets. SEMrush makes it easy to find your featured snippets. And this method works equally well when you are sleuthing for your competitors’ featured snippets. To get started, head over to “Positions” in “Organic Research.” You can then either filter the list of keywords under Advanced Filters by: Include > SERP Features > Featured Snippets, or you can simply select the “Featured snippet” link under the “SERP features” list on the right-hand side of the page. Another excellent tool for finding tracking featured snippets is Stat Search Analytics. You will first need to create a keyword list to upload into Stat. Once Stat has the rankings for your keywords, the Stat interface will show you which of your tracked keywords are producing featured snippet result types, which Stat flags as “answer” type results. With Stat, you can filter those keywords to focus on those you are ranking in the top 10 results for, as well as tag keywords you want to track. SearchMetrics Suite also features tracking for featured snippets. They call them “Direct Answers,” but you can see in the screen shot below where they have filtered for a set of terms that nytimes.com ranks on where there are Direct Answers present. In many cases, these direct answers are Featured Snippets, as you can see in the example, “vegan Thanksgiving recipes.” Step 2: Finding great keyword candidates for featured snippets Now that we have a baseline and a better understanding of what keywords are getting featured snippets, let’s find more opportunities. Finding great candidates for featured snippets comes down to good old-fashioned keyword research. As you do your research, here are some things to keep in mind: Higher-volume terms get snippets more often. Longer queries that are comprised of six or more words tend to show featured snippets. Since the purpose of featured snippets is to answer questions, explicit questions like “who,” “what,” “how,” “where” and “why” search queries will obviously often have featured snippets. But don’t overlook implied questions with the words like “does,” “cause” and “costs,” as well as action words like “becoming,” “doing,” “getting,” “making,” “forming” or “cooking.” Implied questions also include searches on terms. Consider a search for “email marketing,” where the searcher is looking for a definition by essentially asking the implied question, “What is email marketing?” Snippets for general questions usually trigger a paragraph type of featured snippet. ‘People also ask’ Particularly if you search on general questions, you can find additional keywords that result in featured snippets in the “People also ask” section in the SERPs. Here, a search on “email marketing” gets a featured snippet, as well as a list of related search terms in “People also ask,” including “What is an email campaign?” Clicking on “What is an email campaign?” reveals a featured snippet that answers that question. Answerthepublic.com To get a list of questions that are asked about particular topic, a very useful data mining tool is answerthepublic.com, which uses the Google Suggest API to find all the permutations of a question that people are searching on. Shown below are all the questions answerthepublic.com found for the keyword “cook vegetables.” We can then drill down into the specific questions for each question modifier. Here are the “how” questions for the keyword “cook vegetables.” The long-tail keyword, “how to cook vegetables in a slow cooker,” does indeed return a featured snippet. You can also get lists of queries formulated as questions from Moz Keyword Explorer. (Go to the Keyword Suggestions tab, and where you see the pull-down list “Display keyword suggestions that,” select the option “are questions.”) You can also get questions from Rank Ranger’s Keyword Finder by clicking “Questions” under “Quick Filters.” If you have a Stat account, you can export a list of keywords from Answer the Public and then upload them into Stat to automate the process for determining which of the questions return a featured snippet in the SERPs. Step 3: Increasing the potential for featured snippet selection Whether we are creating the page from scratch or improving the page, to increase our chances of being selected for a featured snippet, we want to take a multi-pronged approach that includes: content that clearly answers the question. clean code and tagging that Google can easily understand. positive user engagement signals. I have found that your chances of being selected for a featured snippet can improve if you follow the content organizational model that I outline below: First, repeat the question that is the query, or which is implicit in the query, clearly and prominently on your web page. Directly following the question, provide a short, direct, clear answer to the question. Then, provide more information, data, images and so on to answer the question as fully and completely as possible. One way to structure your content is to use what journalists refer to as “the inverted pyramid.” When following the inverted pyramid model, your page starts with the most important information that answers the question, then transitions to more detailed information, and finally wraps up with a broader look at the topic or perhaps a case study or an example. Image Credit: The Air Force Departmental Publishing Office (AFDPO) [Public domain], via Wikimedia CommonsHow you format your HTML can make a difference too. Here are the best practices I recommend: Make the search query, or a very close version of it, a heading on the page. This means, where possible, format that query or question as an H1, H2 and so forth. Summarize the answer to the question in a single paragraph. Format that paragraph in a paragraph HTML tag <p>. Place that paragraph directly below the heading for the question. Aim for making the answer paragraph roughly 40 to 55 words. It can also help to format your content as a list, using the <li> tags. Particularly if the query you are targeting is best answered by delineating steps in a process (e.g., “how to boil an egg”), then use <ol> tags (an ordered list). If you think that a bulleted list provides the best answer to the query, then use <ul> tags (unordered list). Heading tags for each of your steps can also work, rather than <li> tags. Google is quite adept at extracting the content it needs to build a useful featured snippet. Additionally, presenting your content in a question-and-answer format (or as a list of frequently asked questions) can also help Google select a short answer from your page as a featured snippet for a question. And finally, as we mentioned above, if you create a table in your content hoping for a table-type featured snippet, it’s best to use the HTML <table> tag instead of using CSS to lay out your table. For existing web pages, I like to take a look at a page’s user engagement metrics (bounce rate, average session duration, # of pages visited) in Google Analytics. If the metrics are substantially below the site’s average, that page isn’t satisfying the needs of our site’s visitors. Since Google is in the business of delivering the best search results to searchers, having a low-performing web page may make it difficult to obtain, and, more importantly, keep a featured snippet. Google will pick up on that poor performer not by spying on your Google Analytics, but by monitoring dwell time and CTR from the SERPs. I presume the reason you want to rank highly in the Google search results is to attract leads and sales. So, while the tagging and content structuring is helpful to getting your position 0 ranking, it is actually more important to focus on making your page the very best answer to the question. Great content is rewarded not just by Google but by customer acquisition and retention. Some opinions expressed in this article may be those of a guest author and not necessarily Search Engine Land.

"Funding Choices" will roll out first in North America, UK, Germany, Australia and New Zealand, Google said in a blog. Google is also working on an ad-blocker of its own, which will function in its Chrome browser. That will block specific adverts that do not meet Google's standards. Ad blocking programs are designed to protect consumers from intrusive web ads that slow down browsers and vacuum up personal data. Ad-blockers take "a big toll" on publishers and producers who rely on advertising revenue, said Sridhar Ramaswamy, Google's senior vice-president in Ads and Commerce. "We believe these changes will ensure all content creators, big and small, can continue to have a sustainable way to fund their work with online advertising," he wrote. Google is part of the Coalition for Better Ads, a group which also includes News Corp, Facebook and Unilever, and is dedicated to "improving users' experience" of online advertising. Recent figures from the Internet Advertising Bureau (IAB) suggested that 22% of UK adults use an ad-blocking service online. In 2016 the service Ad Blocker Plus claimed to have more than 100 million active users worldwide.

Segment fees paid by airlines, age of the technology and how long it takes to get anything new done are all popular reasons for GDS bashing. However, at an airline event last week, the bashing was reserved for Google Flight Search, which is ringing alarm bells for some in the travel industry for the strength it is gathering. It’s a subject close to the heart of CarTrawler’s technology chief Bobby Healy who first laid out his concerns here about a year ago. In short, Healy feels GFS is “very bad” for the airline industry (and travel in general), airline.com and future distribution. He sees the roll out of the service enables Google to extend its reach to the top of the trip planning funnel – i.e where consumers go first to start planning a trip. And, Healy thinks airlines need to evaluate GFS in a different way to other potential threats because of Google’s power and the data it has on consumers and their purchase intent. He says that “in good times” a GDS makes about $3 per booking, an airline makes about $21 but currently, according to Healy, Google is making $16 per online airline booking. “It’s growing every year, widening and deepening as they take more of the travel funnel.” It’s not about cost Healy was speaking at the CAPA conference in Dublin last week but said it’s actually not about cost but about “the loss of control.” He likens Google to a “blender” because it attracts more and more users with its products and ecosystem and gathers more information, data and insight on them. “They have more access to you customers then you’ll ever have, more insight into your customers, more data. It knows your customers location, it knows absolutely everything about your customer. “It has an engineering capability like nothing we’ve ever seen and produce products quicker than anyone else. “Airlines willingly give Google their pricing data and inventory in real time sub 10 response times. That key item is the problem here as you have created the perfect storm for intermediation of your own customer base.” What to do? Airlines can push back GFS on this by only giving up their data on their own terms. This is something Healy believes both American Airlines and Ryanair are doing. And, provide the sort of value Google is providing, via better mobile products, for example. Or, wait for the regulators to catch up. Those solutions seem weak as pointed out by CNN journalist Richard Quest who was moderating the CAPA session and says it’s like “trying to hold back the tide.” He questions whether it’s possible for the airline to be in control and own the customer with the number of distribution channels out there and ongoing disruption. But, ultimately control lies with the customer as Travelport global head of product and marketing Ian Heywood stresses. “That’s where it should reside but it’s about what is put in front of the customer. Is the airline going to be able to do that or is someone else going to do it for them?” Heywood says a more collaborative approach is the way forward so that airlines can improve how products and services are shown to consumers and it is no longer all about price. He adds that airlines need to take steps along an API path to move forward generally. “Everyone talks about disruption, that’s the reason no one has moved anywhere. Airlines have been waiting for a big disruption rather than working with the industry to plan evolution.” Steps to IATA NDC Heywood says airlines need to start using a combination of existing ATPCo technology and API to ensure their content is being distributed via various channels. “Once you have those steps in progress then arilines can see how they can get more content into the API path.” He stresses that it’s going to take a lot of time and will require investment in both API technology and a merchandising platform. “ATPCO works well and is really efficient so we’ve got to make sure new technology and processes are as effective and as efficient.” Heywood adds that carriers will also need to “reengineer the human process” to get buy in from everyone. The last word So, taking into consideration slim margins, 40 years of technology and the complex fare structure – can it be done? Healy says airlines really need to focus on what the problem is. SAP general manager and global head of travel & transportation Paul Pessutti adds that the airline industry needs to invest in areas such as data science. For Heywood, although the industry is only a “minute way along the path” – the technology is there and the standard is there so it’s just about bringing it all together.

Required fields are marked * Comment Notify me of followup comments via e-mail Name * Email * Website Nathan Bobbin Google makes $12-15B top line advertising revenue from the travel space. Why would they want to create a channel conflict with their biggest customers while concurrently entering a business with far lower margins than advertising? Seems to me Google’s strategy must be, as always, to organize this data (content as we call it in the industry) and provide sensible options to the consumer based on everything Google knows about the consumer and the terms of their search. The options provided will be OTA and Supplier.com. Both OTAs and Suppliers need to start thinking about 1) how best to market through a mix of organic & paid search and 2) how to convert users that come to them through search. Almost like real-live eCommece retailers…. The Meta-Search brands seem to be ahead of the curve from my view as a consumer. Reply 3 days ago   Ted There’s only one reason why I start with Google Flights anytime I search for a flight — it doesn’t suck. (1) it doesn’t take forever to give me results; (2) it doesn’t bias the result based on whatever airline is giving them more money (3) the results isn’t cluttered with pop-ups reading “978 other people are buying this ticket” or “add insurance to this trip” (4) they give me the information I want (type of aircraft, meal or no meal, seat pitch or, if in business, lie flat or slanted seats, entertainment or no entertainment, Wi-Fi or no Wi-Fi, etc.), (5) they compare buying separate tickets on roundtrips, (6) their recommendations are usually very good and (7) they allow me to compare flights from different airlines. As a consumer, it’s very clear that the enemy in airline distribution are the airline themselves, whose sites totally suck. For example, on the site from the world’s largest airline, American Airlines, I can’t even tell what meals are included in my $2,000 business class ticket, what type of seat I will be sitting in, or if there will be any seatback entertainment. Why would I ever want to start my purchase there? You should ask consumers before writing articles! Reply 3 weeks ago   N Funny that Mr. Healy balks at the $16 GFS makes per booking, then he goes on to talk about how Google has more access to customers and engineering capability no one else has. Perhaps the $16 is commensurate for the value added by the capabilities/data/funnel of Google that airlines don’t have (and will probably never have). However, I do agree that airlines may be working themselves into a corner by embracing Google. I would also like to know where the $16 number comes from. I suspect he is confusing revenue and profit. Reply 3 weeks ago   Bobby Healy Hi N, not confusing rev from profit…the number on GOOG is indeed rev, because it’s impossible to get to EBITDA based on the numbers they publicly disclose. That number is actually provided by a recent SKIFT article. I think it’s fair to compare GOOGs rev alongside other numbers as an indicator of how rich the segment is for them and how much they are ultimately taking out of the total wallet. Ultimately, ALL of these costs will be paid by the consumer – so the more GOOG take, either the airlines have to subsidise that in some way, or the Hotel and other ancillary aggregators do. Or…(and this is what the EU believes), the Consumer will end up paying. The more expensive advertising becomes, the more the prices will have to rise, or margins decline. And there will only be ONE winner in that equation. The monopoly that controls ALL the traffic. Reply 2 weeks ago   Josh Gunn So Lufthansa estimates that selling a fare through the GDS amounts to €16 and Google is apparently earning $16 (€14.35 as of May ’17) for a flight booked through GFS. Which is the better user experience for the person actually paying for the ticket? Undeniably GFS. Admittedly not a complete apples to apples comparison as both sets of figures are assumptive, but when cost is more or less equal, user experience wins. I agree that a travel industry dominated by Google and Amazon isn’t a future many people, including myself, want but it’s basic human nature to want 1. Choice 2. Value and 3. Simplicity. These things will not change. If the industry ignores that and keeps treating people like they shouldn’t be trying to compare costs and offerings in a quick and simple way then they’ll have nobody to blame but themselves. They should redouble their efforts to build loyal brand followers (looking at you United, BA) while accepting that for many, we just want the cheapest flight with the least amount of hassle involved in booking it. Ps. An airline’s brand investment should inform the user’s decision ahead of time, not dictate it at the point of sale. Reply 2 weeks ago   Ian R Clayton Well GDS is pretty outdated and it time for modern technology and up to date systems to replace it. I am not happy that is Google. It is being very disruptive to travel companies now, from hotels to activities and all the steps from planning to purchase. Its power is unrelenting and it looks poised to close down all the small companies who provide services to travels and hotels. We do not want a single company dominating the entire landscape! Reply 3 weeks ago   Henry Harteveldt ATPCO may “work” well but it is as relevant as a DC-6 in today’s airline world. Airlines are, as the should be, intent on pursuing dynamic pricing, which means less reliance on pre-filed fares and, in turn, ATPCO. Reply 3 weeks ago   Ian Tunnacliffe Henry, you are right but with very few exceptions airlines are literally years away from being able to do dynamic pricing. And this whole mantra about GDSs being outdated is something I have been hearing for more than 20 years. Remember the GDSs rôle is providing data to intermediaries who then interpret it for consumers. These intermediaries may be human travel agents or additional technology layers. The end consumer should never see a raw GDS display. With that in mind, where are the deficiencies in GDS technology? I can think of some but they are as much to do with airlines’ inability to provide their offers in a modern form as they are about the GDSs inability to consume them. Lest anyone be unclear, I do think that the GDSs have been under responsive to airlines’ wishes to update their proposition and I certainly think that there was a period from roughly 1995 to 2005 when they were guilty of some horrific price gouging. All that said, any airline that wants to switch to an API connection to the GDSs is able to do it today, so why have so few outside the LCC space chosen to do so? Reply 2 weeks ago   Paul Byrne Henry, Agree that the desire for airline to retake control, make the offer and know their customer in order to better serve them is the way forward. All of this in real time, in addition. Cost saving/reduced filing/fewer ADMs are all desirable outcomes also. Reply 2 weeks ago   Bobby Healy Agree, BUT…problem with that is that it means the airline is responsible for scaling their systems to internet speeds…which they ain’t very good at.

The San Francisco-based unicorn, whose value is pegged at about $70 billion, said it had trimmed its quarterly loss to $708 million, compared to $991 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, Reuters reported. First quarter revenue rose 18 percent to $3.4 billion. Uber, which is not a publicly traded company, isn’t required to unveil its full financial picture, but it occasionally releases selected figures. Despite its continuing growth and revenue in the multi-billions, Uber has come under critical media scrutiny this year due to a series of missteps and controversies. Among the company’s troubles is a lawsuit by Waymo, a unit of Google parent company Alphabet, claiming that Uber made use of Google trade secrets to develop its self-driving car technology. Waymo alleges that former Google engineer Anthony Levandowski shared those secrets with Uber when Uber hired him to spearhead its own development of autonomous vehicles. On Tuesday, Uber fired Levandowski, who had failed to meet a company deadline to deliver information relevant to the court case. Levandowski was the first of two high-profile executive exits from Uber this week. The second was Uber’s head of finance Gautam Gupta, whose departure to join another company was announced along with Uber’s financial numbers on Wednesday. New York Times stories on Uber are now often accompanied by an infographic showing the growing roster of top staffers who have left the company. They include engineers involved with artificial intelligence, mapping, and self-driving cars, as well as a few executives who left after Uber commissioned an investigation of Uber’s in-house culture. That probe was triggered in February, after former Uber engineer Susan Fowler wrote a widely read blogpost accusing company managers of failing to take action when she told them she had been sexually harassed by a supervisor. Fowler also described a generally roughhouse, inefficient management culture in which women frequently suffered harassment. That, and other controversies that have tarnished Uber’s reputation, were detailed in a New York Magazine piece that kicked off the work week Tuesday under the headline “Is Uber Evil, or Just Doomed?” Writer Reeves Wiedeman describes Uber as facing an “existential crisis,” not only due to bad press, but due to vulnerabilities in its long-term business model. Uber has expanded into many U.S. cities and dozens of countries, but it faces constant battles to operate free of regulations that apply to traditional employers such as taxicab companies. In recent years, Uber drivers have sued to be classified as employees qualified for benefits, rather than as independent contractors. The company has also been accused of inducing drivers to finance the lease or purchase of cars, only to later lower the rates for rides, undermining the income drivers need to pay off the cost of acquiring their vehicles. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick issued a public apology after he was captured on video in February in a testy exchange with a driver who reproached him for lowering rates. The company has also allegedly used a technology called Greyball to mask its presence in cities it didn’t have permission to serve. Underlying all these troubles, Uber’s growth has depended on price competition with taxis, as well as the convenience of tapping an app to summon a ride. But its low rates are now possible because Uber draws on the billions invested in it by venture capital firms, as Wiedeman, Xconomy, and others have pointed out. Uber reportedly has more than $7 billion left of this cash trove, but it has been posting recent annual losses of $2 billion or more. The question is whether Uber can eventually become a profitable global corporation without relying on these cash infusions, and without raising its rates to uncompetitive levels. Already in New York, Uber faces competition not only from its San Francisco ride-hailing rival Lyft, but also from cut-rate Manhattan operators Gett and Via, and two apps, Arro and Curb, that have been created to summon traditional cabs. Uber has been pursuing the driverless car as an escape from the hassles and expense of engaging drivers. But the big companies that might manufacture self-driving cars at scale, from Google to Ford to Tesla, could develop their own apps, or partner with an Uber rival such as Lyft. Wiedeman writes, “Conversations with several dozen current and former Uber employees and executives suggested that though there is time to right the ship, and a war chest of venture capital to do so, Silicon Valley has found itself at least preparing for the notion that it mispriced its darling. Uber could be the next MySpace, some say, a company that created a market but was foiled by its own missteps and overtaken by savvier competition.” For next week’s news cycle, Uber can look forward to digesting, and possibly releasing, the results of the investigation of the company’s workplace culture by former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder’s law firm.

On Friday, Google updated its logo to honor the 66th birthday of Gilbert Baker, the creator of the rainbow flag. The animated doodle features several strips of fabric in multiple colors coming together to form the flag. Baker created the flag in 1978 as a more positive alternative to the pink triangle, used by Nazis to classify LGBTQ people during World War II. "The rainbow is so perfect because it really fits our diversity in terms of race, gender, ages, all of those things," Baker said in a 2015 interview with The Museum of Modern Art. "Plus, it’s a natural flag—it’s from the sky!” Baker died in March. The original rainbow flag featured eight colors, each meant to represent the diversity of the community, but is now six: red, orange, yellow, green, blue and violet.  Follow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23.   Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2slSdQl Most Popular Apple WWDC to tout new features for iPhone, iPad Siri gets another shot at getting it right Google honors Gilbert Baker, creator of the rainbow flag Net neutrality opponents agree: FCC fake comments are a problem The next 10 years in tech with Walt Mossberg

This past December, Linda Kost, president of Congregation Beth Sholom in Leesburg, received a telephone call from a man named Norman Siegel, who, with his wife, Frankie, were ex-pats in Costa Rica for about five years and were now looking to return to the United States. They knew that they wanted to go to Florida but were unsure as to where-just that there be a good number of Jewish families and synagogues. Finding our website on Google, he telephoned Linda. Linda knew that I often travelled to Costa Rica and that I might still be there. Unsure, I received an email with the subject, "r u home?" Well, I had already returned, but I contacted Norman. Through the exchange of emails, we got to know one another a bit and then I received an email asking when I would return to Costa Rica and could we meet. The timing was perfect-my wife, Helen, and I were leaving for Costa Rica in a few weeks. Two weeks later we arrived in San Jose and I contacted Norman. He asked if we would like to accompany them to services on Saturday. He advised that Saturday services were usually in English, except that this Saturday, the rabbi was on vacation and the services would be led by a member of the congregation-mostly in Spanish. The first Jewish settlers in Costa Rica were "Conversos" who fled the Spanish Inquisition. Through assimilation, hardly a trace of this group remains. Currently, there are about 3,000 Jews in Costa Rica-at least half of whom came before and immediately after World War II. Coming from two Polish towns, about 50 miles from Warsaw, helps to explain the community is primarily orthodox. The Jewish community is centered in San Jose. There are four synagogues in San Jose, the largest of which is Shaarei Zion, an Ashkenanzi Orthodox synagogue and administrator of the Orthodox Cemetery; Chabad Lubavitch (Hassidic); B'nai Israel (Reformed); and Bet Midrash Morasha (Sephardic Orthodox). There are kosher butchers, a schochet (ritual slaughterer), restaurants (delicatessens and a kosher Burger King) and kosher products available in larger supermarkets. It's now Saturday and Norman advises us to take Uber car service to Calle 90 (pronounced "kahyea"-"street" in Spanish) to Congregation B'nai Israel. You can't miss the shul-it's a white building on the corner with Jewish stars in the windows! I look up Google maps to get an idea as to where Calle 90 is. It is only a 10-minute ride from our hotel, and it's only two blocks long. Google Earth View shows a large white building at the end of the street. We get to the street and drive up to the large white building. It seems closed but we get out and walk around the corner where there seems to be an entrance only to find that the entrance is to a family's home. There is a family in the front yard that must have just arrived home as a young man is closing the entrance gate. I approached the young man and asked if he knew about Congregation B'nai Israel and showed him pictures of the building on my cell phone. He informed us that it was not in this area and he did not know where it was. By this time the Uber driver had left. We were two stranded souls in the middle of who knows where. The look on our faces must have said something because the young man's mother came over to see if she could help. She asked us for the name of the synagogue and found it on Google. She telephoned to find out where it was located. At the same time, I telephoned Norman and asked where he was. He said that he was at Calle 90 and waiting for us. I told him that we were at Calle 90 and he was nowhere in sight nor was the shul. He then asked me if I was with someone who was talking to someone at the shul. I told him that I was and at that moment the young man came over and told us that his mother knew where it was and that they would drive us there. The family of three and Helen and I all packed ourselves into a pick-up truck and drove over. There was, in fact, a continuation of Calle 90, also only two blocks long, on the other side of a major road that bisected Calle 90. Along the way, the mother said to Helen, "You must be good people. Angels are watching over you." Helen replied, "Yes, you are an angel." When we arrived at the shul, Norman was waiting outside and had a broad smile on his face. We entered the 2-story building only to find out that the second floor was actually a balcony with an office for the rabbi. The sanctuary had a 2-story ceiling. Seats were arranged on a horseshoe pattern leaving an open area in the front of the bimah. Norman had told us that this was a "progressive" synagogue and we were fully expecting to witness a Reformed service. Norman told us that since the 1992 and 1994 synagogue bombings in Argentina, membership in any of the synagogues required careful vetting-a letter from your rabbi at home, a copy of your passport, a meeting with the rabbi, etc. It was impossible to gain entrance to attend a service without someone to vouch for you. I immediately noticed that none of the older men wore the short tallis around their necks but, instead, wore the long tallis that flowed over their shoulders and covered their back. The traditional small tallis was worn by the young men in the congregation. Each of the women wore a similar tallis albeit in more feminine colors. As I looked around the room, I saw that the only Americans there were Norman and Frankie, Helen and I and one other man by the name of Phil Gelman, who was from New York City and also a past-president of the congregation. The rest of the assemblage was made of men and women of various tones of brown. I was told that most of the women were converted to Judaism. As we made our way around the synagogue, people came up to welcome us. Here we were, 1300 miles from home, in a country where we don't speak the language but never felt alone or distant. Is this the way Costa Ricans are by nature or were we welcomed because we are Jewish? My answer is an emphatic both, especially based on the events getting to the synagogue. Primarily though, it was because we are Jewish and, to quote from our history, strangers in a foreign land. Helen and I have attended bar mitzvahs for her grand-nephews in France and I attended Kol Nidre services in Tokyo. We were welcomed as though we were the prodigal children returning to the family. And, the conversation is always the same: where are you from... are there many Jews... what is your synagogue like... what is your rabbi like? After you get these basic questions out of the way, the conversation roams in every direction. I read through the program for the service and saw names such as Yaakov Rodriguez, Alejandro Lev and Shmuel Perez among many others. At this point, a young woman approached a chair that was located on the floor directly in front of the bimah and called the service to order. The prayer book seemed to be modeled after the Gates of Prayer (the Amidah included the matriarchs) but was quite unique in form. The siddur was written and published by the congregation and was tri-lingual-Hebrew, Spanish and English-as well as transliteration for some of the Hebrew prayers. Congregation B'nei Israel positions itself as the only tri-lingual synagogue in Costa Rica-and for all I know, possibly the world. When it came time for the Torah service, another young woman took the seat and directed a reading of the translation of the week's Parsha: Kedoshim. Some read it in English but most were in Spanish. After the reading, she read what she had written about her understanding of the Parsha. This was followed by an open discussion of the Parsha among the congregation-unfortunately for me, mostly in Spanish. I wish that I understood the discussion because some of the speakers were addressing the group with great emotion. This discussion lasted about an hour and was followed by taking out the Torah and calling congregants for an Aliyah. Rather than have a single person read the Torah, each person sang his/her portion directly from the Torah. I later learned that they are trained by the rabbi to read and sing the Parsha during a weekly class. Listening to the chanting of the Parsha sections, I became aware of the slightly different accents the people have, which made me aware of the vast differences of people and what binds us together as Jews-faith and belief in a single G-d, history and traditions. These attributes allow us to walk into any synagogue in the world, listen to what is being said or hear the melody of a particular prayer and immediately be able to pick up a siddur and find the page where the congregation is in the service. Near the closing of the service, Helen and I stood to say Kaddish on her father's yahrzeit. While only one other person was standing, all eyes seemed to be on us. At the conclusion of the service, people came over and said, "How fortunate that we were here for you to be able to say Kaddish." What a warm thing to say. Everyone gathered in a small room for Kiddish. There was a table with food and cake in the center and everyone moved to encircle the table. Manischewitz Concord Grape wine and Welch's Grape juice was handed out and a congregant said the blessing for wine. Then, two challahs were uncovered and as the HaMotzi was about to be said, the entire congregation placed their right hand on the shoulder of the person on their right. I have no idea what the source of this tradition is or the meaning. To me, however, it was joining everyone present into a single unit and closing the circle of community. After an hour or so of socializing, the group started to head to their homes. One man came over and asked where we were staying and how we were getting there. I told him the name of the hotel and about Uber and he said, "Wait, I'll get you a ride." He did and we did. My take away from this adventure is that a Jew is a Jew no matter where he goes. I can walk into any synagogue in the world and begin to pray with people who may look different or have an accent and know that, in a short time I will cease to be a stranger in a foreign land.

International Business Times UK UK World Business Politics Fintech Technology Science Sport Entertainment Opinion Video Pictures Log out Newsletter Signup Smartphones Cybersecurity Innovation Social Media Games Motoring Technology CyberSecurity Can you hack Android? Google will pay you $200,000 if you can find a way Bug bounty quadrupled but in the last two years no researcher had claimed the top reward. By Jason Murdock June 2, 2017 14:10 BST The new Google logo is displayed at the Google headquarters on September 2, 2015 in Mountain View, CaliforniaJustin Sullivan/Getty Images If you are a tech-savvy hacker interested in earning yourself $200,000 (£156,000) by finding a critical vulnerability in the Android operating system then Google wants to hear from you, this week revealing it has quadrupled its top level bug bounty reward. A working exploit leading to a compromise of Android's "TrustZone" of "Verified Boot" mechanisms will get you $200,000, up from $50,000 in 2016. Additionally, a remote kernel proof-of-concept could leave you $150,000 better off, up from $30,000. In the past year, Google said it had received more than 450 vulnerability reports from researchers, with the average pay-out per expert jumping by over 50%. The total amount of rewards issued doubled to a massive $1.1 million. It is clear white-hat hacking comes with some perks. Due to this, Google said it had decided to increase the top-line pay-outs of its "Security Rewards" programme. In a fresh update, published on 1 June, the Android Security team's Mayank Jain and Scott Roberts revealed that within the last two years no researcher had yet claimed the top reward – reserved for a highly-critical "remote exploit chain" leading to a full compromise. The Google researchers wrote: "Two years ago, we launched the Android Security Rewards program. In its second year, we've seen great progress. Thank you to all the amazing researchers who submitted complete vulnerability reports to us last year. "We're constantly working to improve the Android Security Rewards program and today we're making a few changes. In addition to rewarding for vulnerabilities, we continue to work with the broad and diverse Android ecosystem to protect users from issues reported through our program. Google is offering up to $200,000 as a reward for white-hatsiStock "We collaborate with manufacturers to ensure issues are fixed on their devices through monthly security updates. Over 100 device models have a majority of their deployed devices running a security update from the last 90 days. Thank you to everyone who helped make Android safer." Bug bounty programmes have become popular with huge companies in recent years because they let white-hat hackers report critical (and non-critical) bugs and vulnerabilities in a safe manner. If responsible disclosure rules are followed, the pay-out can be lucrative. "Through [Android Security Rewards] we provide monetary rewards and public recognition for vulnerabilities disclosed to the Android Security Team," Google says on its website. "The reward level is based on the bug severity and increases for complete reports that include reproduction code, test cases, and patches. "Android Security Rewards covers bugs in code that runs on eligible devices and isn't already covered by other reward programs at Google. Eligible bugs include those in AOSP code, OEM code (libraries and drivers), the kernel, and the TrustZone OS and modules." The rise of Google shows no sign of slowing. In May this year, the firm revealed Android is now powering two billion active devices and its Google Drive service is now enjoyed by 800 million monthly active users. There's never been more incentive to find ghosts in the machine.

Written by Alan Dunn June 02, 2017 Time to get more creative. (AP Photo/Toby Talbot) Share Written by Alan Dunn June 02, 2017 The world is nearly out of good “.com” domain names—and even the fourth circuit of the United States Court of Appeals agrees. As global internet usage rises, .com naming is going to get more and more complicated. Our languages only contain a finite number of meaningful words, so brand naming is becoming much more than coming up with a unique, snazzy moniker—it also involves knowledge of intellectual property rights, law, and a large of dash of luck. Many well-known brands have encountered challenges securing their preferred domain names. For example, Google renamed their parent company “Alphabet,” but it doesn’t own alphabet.com—BMW does. In 2014, Microsoft spent $2.5 billion to acquire Mojang, the Swedish company behind the popular Minecraft video game, but it didn’t get the domain name minecraft.com with it—that belongs to an Australia mining-engineering company, MineCraft Consulting PTY Ltd. (Oh yeah—that Minecraft.) Meanwhile, Nissan has spent over 20 years trying to acquire nissan.com from a man named Uzi Nissan, and it took Apple 16 years to acquire apple.co.uk from a British company called Apple Illustrations. Acronyms get even messier. Governmental organizations such as CIA.com, NSA.com, FBI.com, Mossad.com, and Mi6.com are all owned by private individuals and companies. A Google search for BOA (an acronym often used by Bank of America) may show a page covered in Bank of America listings, but a visit to BOA.com will rattle anybody with a fear of snakes. ABBA.com is not the Swedish group, but an acronym for the American Bed and Breakfast Association; DND.com isn’t owned by Dungeons and Dragons; and MOFO.com is actually safe to view at work. (It’s owned by the law firm, Morrison & Foerster). First come, first served So why don’t the big guys pull rank when it comes to owning their digital properties as well as their marketplace? That’s because most domain-name registries operate on a simple first-come, first-served rule for reservations and registrations. While this model is likely the only fair way to service a broad community, it has its drawbacks. Take Tesla, for example. Most people know of Elon Musk’s company, but fewer people know it was named after Nikola Tesla, the renowned Serbian inventor. As Tesla isn’t a word created for a brand—such as Jeep, Chapstick, or Jacuzzi—it’s more likely to be adopted by others who share the same appreciation for the original inventor. For example, Tesla Tecnologia e Comunicação owns tesla.com.br (Brazil), TESLA MR Scanning operates owns tesla.dk (Denmark), Tesla CRM Software GmbH owns tesla.de (Germany), and The Tesla Company owns tesla.gr (Greece). In theory, all of these owners have just as much right to a primary Tesla domain name as the others.  ABBA.com is not the Swedish group, DND.com isn’t owned by Dungeons and Dragons, and MOFO.com is actually safe to view at work. Some brands have been able to acquire their preferred domain names through cash or creative equity deals, such as Uber, which agreed to trade 2% of the company’s shares to Universal Music for the domain name uber.com, or Slack, which paid $60,000 for the domain name slack.com. Others will opt for less-friendly methods such as litigation or filing a Uniform Dispute Resolution Process (UDRP). The latter involves a great risk in the case of a loss, including almost always a higher cost. Domain names are a critical part of a company’s infrastructure, so it’s important for them to fight for them: Not only are they the storefront for a brand’s image online, but they also play a crucial role in everything from email to e-commerce. Many of today’s greatest companies even employ “global domain-name managers” who often have years of trademark and IP experience. Let’s say you spend tens of thousands of dollars (and portion of your sanity) on securing your desired domain name—then what about wrestling back the attached social-media handles? The real @SlimShady It’s hard to say who the real Slim Shady is, since @slimshady hasn’t tweeted since opening his account in 2007. Like domain names, social handles also operate on a first-come, first-served basis, causing very similar confusion throughout social platforms. For example, when Donald Trump won the 2016 US presidential election, Mike Pence also won his slot as vice president. Another winner was a Florida man whose name did not appear on a ballot—he describes himself as a “software developer, grandpa and nature lover. Not a Christo-fascist politician.” He is also named Mike Pence, and he happens to operate the @mikepence Twitter handle. I'm Mike Pence. No, not that one. https://t.co/JFtzxn197W — Mike Pence (@mikepence) December 12, 2016 I tried to see if Twitter co-founder @jackdorsey had anything to say about this, but I quickly realized that attempt might be futile. In fact, a whole bunch of tech leaders’ Twitter handles look a whole lot different than their real world counterparts. If the CEO of Twitter doesn’t have control over his own name’s Twitter handle, what hope do the rest of us have? (Twitter screenshot) And it’s just not personal names, either. Brands are subject to others using their preferred handles with almost no recourse. (Twitter screenshot) Social handles are often more challenging to acquire than domain names as there are fewer resolution methods available for an acquisition. Buying a social handle can be tricky, and selling a Twitter handle is actually against Twitter’s rules. For the most part, any decision to release or transfer a handle is left in the hands of the social handle’s owner. Some people, like Haje Jan Kamps, have used trademark law to find creative ways to acquire their handle for the cost of an application fee. However, successful attempts are few and far between. The future of .com To counteract these challenges, brands have started investing in branded digital-naming solutions for the future.  New domain name extensions like .club and .link have shown good success—while others like .bible and .rodeo are still trying to find a wider following. In 2014, ICANN—the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, which oversees primary DNS and IP regulation, maintenance, and co-ordination for the internet—introduced a series of new, generic, top-level domain names (gTLDs). This added more options to an ever-shrinking pool of quality .com domain names. New domain name extensions like .club and .link have shown good success with respect to new registrations—while others like .bible and .rodeo are still trying to find a wider following. But this last round of new gTLD applications also saw over 600 brands spend more than a collective $100 million on application fees alone for brand-related domain name extensions. Nike now owns .nike, BMW owns .bmw, and McDonald’s even owns .mcdonalds, which is a full 180-degree turn from 1994, when Joshua Quittner tried to get the ubiquitous restaurant chain to acquire McDonalds.com. “The thing about domain names is that they have become a precious commodity in their own right,” says David Taylor, a partner at Hogan Lovells and domain-name panellist for the World Intellectual Property Organization. “The opportunity provided by the ICANN new gTLD program has enabled many brands to move to the right of the dot, with a .brand. Given the application fee was $185,000, these are relatively costly domain names, but it’s often a cheaper option to paying large sums out to acquire a pre-registered and lovingly owned .com domain name that is being used for a genuine business or activity.” Over the next few years, we may see the face of the internet change as more brands shift to using branded extensions. Barclay’s, Canon, and BNP Paribas are already early adopters who have made the move, taking control over everything to the left of the dot. When a brand owns an entire extension and can actually control who can register, it puts a lot more power in their hands. Applications for new gTLDs have now closed, but it shouldn’t be too long until ICANN opens up the opportunity for more branded domain names once more. In the meantime, people will continue to call Minecraft Australia for game support, tag @mikepence in their political discussions, and question whether or not Paul Ryan is selling guitars on the side.

Google confirms it will block bad ads in Chrome, starting in early 2018 Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/06/01 3:35pm PDTJun 1, 2017 83 Plus 1 on G+ 441 Share on Facebook 121 Share on Twitter Total Shares645 Applications Google News About two months ago, the Wall Street Journal reported that Google would add an ad-blocking feature into the Chrome web browser. Similar to AdBlock Plus' default setting, Chrome would block ads deemed unacceptable (such as pop-ups, auto-playing video ads, etc). Google has now confirmed this, and shared further details about how it will work. In a post on the company's blog, Google announced that it is joining the Coalition for Better Ads, an industry group attempting to improve online ads. The group has developed the Better Ads Standards, a list of guidelines for desktop and mobile ads based on comprehensive research. Ads deemed unacceptable include pop-ups, auto-playing video ads with sound, large sticky ads, and other common formats. In the post, Google confirmed that Chrome will soon not show ads, including those served by Google, on websites not in compliance with the Better Ads Standards. The change will take effect in "early 2018." This is huge news, especially considering that Google serves more online ads than any company on Earth. Now that Chrome has approximately 60% of the desktop browser market share (and growing), sites will likely have no choice than to follow the guidelines.

Can get rid of those annoying app install ads when browsing on the phone! Corbin Davenport Yeah, I think those are included, since they stick to the top while scrolling. Mgamerz Great news, but I guarantee you there's going to be a shitstorm headed their way really quick. Corbin Davenport Oh for sure. Something something free market. bekifft This is huge. However if they don't address the issue of deceptive ads, it's still a big problem. Hopefully one day I can finally in good conscience stop installing ad blockers as simply a security measure to protect my users. Corbin Davenport I haven't looked through all of the standard's documentation, but I don't see anything about deceptive ads. But I agree, that should be addressed. My1 not really android related but when these things like get 10000 euro in a month easily show up in SKYPE, an application by MICROSOFT that hurts, and they even have HTTPS ads with certificate errors Eli Stevens I get the job done from convenience of my place, with very simple projects that only needs only from you a Desktop computer system as well as web connection and I am happier than before...

"Which giant 'Download Here' button is the right one?! Oh, of course, it's the tiny text link buried between three of them." Santos Chavez Ugh, I hate those sites with a passion. They're part of the reason i vehemently block ads. Take your stupid large fake green buttons outta here, filths :3 Adriannacsmith Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Cat Astrophy Deceptive is extremely hard to deal with and far more subjective. "Bad" can be virus ridden, or employing technical methods that can be detected automatically (like pop ups). Gregory Will there be an option to block all ads without exceptions? Corbin Davenport Most likely not. Artem Russakovskii Sort of, but if you subscribe to sites running Funding Choices and use Contributor to buy an ad-free pass. Which is how it should be if you want to enjoy quality content from creators. Good ads and free if you don't. No ads and small fee if you do. Bimmer Ime or you can install an adblocker and enjoy no ads and no fee :) Tom Westrick And the sites you enjoy won't be able to sustain themselves... Nathan J Are they hurting now? Because that's what we have now. We have ad blockers, and we have ABP with its acceptable ads, but a lot of people turn it off. How about the sack on that guy, telling the main guy at AP to block ads on his own site? I'm a block-everything guy too, but I'm going to be seriously looking into this Funding Choices thing. I don't want my ad-free page views being wasted on just any old site, but sites I read daily, like AP and Neowin, I definitely want to see them get their cut. Cakefish ABP allows through Taboola, Outbrain and Revcontent. The polar opposite of acceptable ads. R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ That would kill the internet and you would have to pay for everything. Ads are what make the internet free Gregory You know, they can always make money on others, not on me. Most people don't bother blocking ads, they simply don't care. Mark Curtis Yeah gimme free entertainment, but YOU foot the bill! David The internet was in fact a much *worse* place before ads became a thing. All the nice stuff you have access to now only exists because of ad revenue (email, YouTube, any and all social networking platforms) Toys Samurai He reminds me of some people whom I know -- always say they hate ads and would rather pay for it. But when the content provider actually asks for money, they don't open up their wallets. Jorgen Phillips This is the most hippocritical thing I think I have ever read. Toys Samurai Exactly. This very site he's reading would not even exist if everyone blocks ads. David That's not true, they could just use a different monetization model. Nathan J Hypocritical. You may be thinking of the hippocratic oath, where the famous phrase "do no harm" comes from. If only ads would pledge to do no harm... abc You can pay for it and I'll coast for free. Ha ha, I'm a dick! Nathan J There already is. That's what we have now. I mean, we have the no ad blocker option, which is default. Then you have Adblock Plus's default setting, which whitelists ads ABP considers to be not malicious. And that's what Google is doing. Then you have ABP with that feature turned off, or something like uBlock Origin, that just blocks all the ads indiscriminately. This is a future measure that is designed to be more tolerant than current "all or nothing" solutions, plus Google is an advertising business. So, there probably won't be. Eddy Nelson Lopez They profit from it, why would they do it? 😂😂 Corbin Davenport They won't profit from it if a majority of users have an ad blocker. Which is where things are headed right now. exadeci They can blocks ads from everyone except theirs and having the most popular browser they can sell the exclusivity to other ad agencies. Corbin Davenport "In the post, Google confirmed that Chrome will soon not show ads, including those served by Google, on websites not in compliance with the Better Ads Standards." exadeci Couldn't they just prevent bad ads on their platform?! Imparus The problem is how you serve them to the user. If you create a popup filled with Google ads, it would be bad ads even thought they are Google approved ads. exadeci Right but if they can detect it in Chrome why can't they use this to disable the ads on the website that abuses it? Sonny Bono I'm guessing it's a preventative measure, seeing how many people get virused through some popup ads that they don't realize are a pathway to malicious software. We certainly don't want another epidemic of ransomware. I find most of my service calls go to elderly people who have no idea what they're doing and get tons of malware/ransomware. One old lady I was working with a few weeks ago actually "called microsoft" per the directions on her browser and gave them her credit card number. It wasn't really microsoft. abqnm As long as it takes care of the shady JavaScript click event pop-unders and other such js deceptive ad techniques which are generally not able to be caught by ad-blockers. I would really love to be able to go back to having JavaScript enabled and blacklist only certain sites rather than have to keep it disabled and whitelist the majority of my internet experience. TW Does this mean my phone won't connect constantly start vibrating because of ads on legitimate sites? raazman I'm sorry you have to experience this is this day and age. AintaDamnThingFunny This!! I've always wondered how those got through Chrome's security. I mean, it's an obtrusive add that makes your phone vibrate, and all you can do is close out the browser. How the hell do those get through and how has Google not stopped this from happening? Imparus Because a website can access the vibrator API, this is useful in the example of facebook, where you can activate notification for the site, and not having to use their shitty app. TW Now I know what to call the thing I hate: Vibrator API Total Insecurity For some reason female users like this API... BRO i prefer my phone silent, no notification sound or vibration, as i mostly use my pc with pushbullet mirroring My1 what the hell, how about they just pop a notif and let the phone do the rest? Imparus Okay so it was a bad example with facebook, since it is the notification API they are using not the vibration one, which means it follows the same rules as other applications. I should just have said a game might use it, but at the moment it is mainly used for BS ads. My1 okay, but I see no point in point in using the vibration on a website anyway. Imparus PWA, I mentioned game, since PWA is one of the new thing that is very likely to become huge in the next few years. Here you can try some few application made in it https://pwa.rocks/ so it is more that you should be ready for a paradigm change in what a website is, since the line between webapp and normal app will almost disappear. Example I use the QR scanner, so I don't have to have a dedicated app for it. My1 well honestly I think the PWA stuff is taking it too far, especially games, I mean dont they run better when compiled and optimized for an OS? also websites are supposed to work on any device that has a more or less modern browser and when games need for example multitouch, that thing is not really funny on a device without touch, since I cant summon a second mouse arrow. and when websites are starting to lose the point of working pretty much everywhere and becoming a gimmick it's starting to get stupid. especially if you have a bad internet connection these PWAs arent as great as when you just have your application. with the browser opening more and more, it's seriously going to risk opening itself to viruses and stuff Imparus I unfortunately don't have the time at the moment to explain all of these to you, so this will be quick rundown, and the rest you will have to research yourself if you are interested in it. "well honestly I think the PWA stuff is taking it too far, especially games, I mean dont they run better when compiled and optimized for an OS? " For most stuff it isn't a problem at all, as for game if they are simple enough optimization isn't as relevant. Most game would be written for an engine like unity or unreal, and one of the new thing in relation to PWA are modules, that will allow the use of engine like that, it also allow webapps to work completely offline. There will of course be some apps that are very heavy in computation on device that will make sense to run with native code that can run better, but there are being worked on optimizing things such as JS to make it run faster. "also websites are supposed to work on any device that has a more or less modern browser and when games need for example multitouch, that thing is not really funny on a device without touch, since I cant summon a second mouse arrow." You can have the browser serve different code depending on the device, that actually isn't anything new. "and when websites are starting to lose the point of working pretty much everywhere and becoming a gimmick it's starting to get stupid. " PWA actually allow apps to work everywhere, instead of just the OS you coded it to. Having one single code base would be great for pretty much every company. "especially if you have a bad internet connection these PWAs arent as great as when you just have your application." You can easily code for it to work offline, take the QR scanner on the side I linked you, I don't need internet to use it at all. Think of PWA like normal apps, if you use twitter then try using the PWA they have created. "with the browser opening more and more, it's seriously going to risk opening itself to viruses and stuff" Not really, this is one of the thing I will say you need to research yourself, since it will be quite a long explanation, I would start by looking into why chromeOS is more secure than Windows. I said there will be a huge grow with PWA over the next few years, since it is still very early in its development, only Firefox and Chrome support it at the moment and Edge will bring support in fall. AintaDamnThingFunny Right, but websites always ask me for permission if I want their notifications. Facebook using the vibrator API with your permission is one thing. Having an obtrusive add use it without your permission is another. Imparus That is because a website don't need to ask for permission, so it is more that Google should make it a permission check before allowing to use the vibration. Santos Chavez OMG I hate those types of ads! Especially when the ads that popup are so obstrusive I can't do anything but exit Chrome. Ugh! Rob Yeah, but some people love the vibrator API. hooch Holy shit I didn't even know this was a thing. Been using Firefox + uBlock Origin for a couple of years. blindexecutioner Doesn't affect me much. I already block ads. Nathan J It's not meant to affect you or I or anyone else who knows what uBlock Origin is. Google Chrome is the most popular browser, so I imagine what it will affect is the 60% or however many people use Chrome, and all of a sudden they're blocking malicious ads. That will affect a lot. I suspect for you and I, we will probably be able to just disable Google's solution and use our own, and if Google blocks other ad blockers, there's always Chromium. AS The biggest annoyances for me are subscribe popovers and EU cookie warnings. Things like taboola and outbrain need to be aggressively blocked. My1 cookie warning are annoying but it shows the scary relatity of all the sites that collect data with cookies. Lateef Alabi-Oki I'll disable my ad blocker if this gets rid of malicious and egregious ads. Nexus Hexus I'm sure most of these "Bad ads" will be alternative media. Or aka "Whatever we don't agree with" boop It's not content that's blocked, but format. Sonny Bono Ironically, all the ads that I find bothersome are on google services themselves, such as YouTube, but I have a Chrome extension (ublock origin) that works to get rid of them. Santos Chavez I enjoy YouTube so much, I pay for YouTube Red, via the Google Play Music Family Plan . Haven't seen an ad, especially on mobile. for months, and I get unlimited music streaming and downloading, all of those features shared to 5 other users. Pretty neat. Sonny Bono If they throw in free movies with the service I'd be down. I can already get anything I want on demand for no cost. I just appreciate watching random videos and I never know what I'm in the mood for. I'll just keep riding the links down the chain, bar tricks, gun porn, rocket engines, science experiments, old computers, animals and hunting videos... whatever it might be. ublock origin fixes the problem with ads - they don't exist any more - but not with popup windows on some questionable websites. abc Good for you. I use an adblocker and don't see any ads on Youtube. And I don't feel bad taking cents away from a multi-billion dollar corporation. I will never pay for streaming services because I like to own things. I could pay Netflix hundreds of dollars over the course of years, and the moment I disconnect, I am left with zero movies. I'd much rather grab some discs from the bargain bin. Gary But do they block those annoying as hell forced Google surveys? Adam Margeson Forced Google surveys? Where are you seeing those served up? And, are you sure they're legitimately from Google? Lord Argyris "...Google confirmed that Chrome will soon not show ads, including those served by Google, on websites not in compliance with the Better Ads Standards." I'm going to guess they're including their own ads here to avoid anticompetitive suits from competing ad providers. If they just blocked the other ads and left their own (presumably compliant ads), they would be gaining an unfair advantage and could be seen to be leveraging their strength in the browser market to incentivize use of their own ad platform. I wondered about this in my comment on the previous AP article on the subject, and it seems Google has considered the matter as well. Santos Chavez Yeah, it's kinda neat; by doing it that way Google avoids all sorts of blames of being hypocrites while also setting the example for everyone. "THIS", they say, "is how ads should be done. Look, we're even doing them to our own; you should, too". Terra Remove the ads that play before a video and we got a deal. Small banners below the video? Ok. Playing a commercial before the content I actually want to see? That is old tv bullcrap and is annoying as hell, even more so than popups. Dennis Ulijn "But, but, but... Terra: how would you solve this on Chromecast, etc.?" tigerberry Playing a commercial WHILE PLAYING THE DAMN VIDEO I'M ACTUALLY WATCHING? Whoever came up with that should be forced to never use an adblocker ever again. Cakefish Wonderful. Please also add extension support to Android Chrome (it's the number 1 feature that it's missing, desktop Chrome wouldn't have been as popular without it) but this is a good start. Ghirahim Install Opera and have a wonderful life. Jun rip pornhub ads Rod I wonder when they will fix the Notification Download Service bug in v58. https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=719641# Rob Thank goodness. Somehow, we went from doing away with auto-play videos and ads years ago, only to have them pop up a lot in recent months. I'm sick of them. BC Google is finally making a move that I truly approve of. Ads, especially the invasive ones have really taken over. I don't care about banner ads that I see just once or ads on the side. The ones that infuriate me the most are those that obscure content, automatically play loud sounds/videos. Those that try to trick the user into installing something they don't obviously need, need to die in a fire. It's why I've installed Ghostery and use Mercury Reader to banish that bullshit to the depths of the internet hell. I'm also pleased that Google is being smart about this and blocking all invasive content...Even if it comes directly from their company because they need to be impartial and control these insanely bad adverts. Forcing a standard will hopefully make the internet a cleaner place, one that can support the advert model without being deliberately invasive or deceptive. Dragos Lucian The only thing that makes me use an adblocker on a lot of websites, is because, more often than not, you don't even need to click on the ads to be presented with a buttload of new tabs or individual pages. You just need to click on a blank area and boom ! You can barely make your way back to the page you initially were. If those type of ads go away, then I'll make sure to uninstall my adblocker. Till then, fuck everyone who posts those type of ads on their websites in order to gain revenue. Make your money off selling socks. Abhishek Mittal Does this mean my phone wont start buzzing and downloading unwanted apps without my permission? This is huge, a great step by google in improving quality of the internet Spinkick Does it bother anyone that google is the one that decides which ads are bad? abc Google means that they are going to block their competitors ads and only allow their own.

Name: Subject: Message: Magisk Manager removed from Google Play, dev vows to continue working on it Newsby Scott Adam Gordon3 days ago 16 388 36 Magisk Manager, an app that made it possible to run Android Pay and Pokemon Go on rooted phones, has been removed from the Google Play Store for violating its malicious behavior policy. The app, which could hide software modifications from apps that require unaltered operating systems, was pulled on Google‘s authority, and its lead developer, topjohnwu, was emailed with an explanation of the decision. The dev suspects that the app conflicts with two Google policies specifically: “Apps that introduce or exploit security vulnerabilities,” and “Apps or SDKs that download executable code, such as dex files or native code, from a source other than Google Play.” If this is the case, Google is within its rights to remove it from the Play Store.

The story isn’t over for Magisk (which stands for “Magic Mask”) though, as topjohnwu has vowed to continue work on the app and will likely distribute it through third-party sites.

Google confirms it will block bad ads in Chrome, starting in early 2018 Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/06/01 3:35pm PDTJun 1, 2017 83 Plus 1 on G+ 441 Share on Facebook 121 Share on Twitter Total Shares645 Applications Google News About two months ago, the Wall Street Journal reported that Google would add an ad-blocking feature into the Chrome web browser. Similar to AdBlock Plus' default setting, Chrome would block ads deemed unacceptable (such as pop-ups, auto-playing video ads, etc). Google has now confirmed this, and shared further details about how it will work. In a post on the company's blog, Google announced that it is joining the Coalition for Better Ads, an industry group attempting to improve online ads. The group has developed the Better Ads Standards, a list of guidelines for desktop and mobile ads based on comprehensive research. Ads deemed unacceptable include pop-ups, auto-playing video ads with sound, large sticky ads, and other common formats. In the post, Google confirmed that Chrome will soon not show ads, including those served by Google, on websites not in compliance with the Better Ads Standards. The change will take effect in "early 2018." This is huge news, especially considering that Google serves more online ads than any company on Earth. Now that Chrome has approximately 60% of the desktop browser market share (and growing), sites will likely have no choice than to follow the guidelines.

Can get rid of those annoying app install ads when browsing on the phone! Corbin Davenport Yeah, I think those are included, since they stick to the top while scrolling. Mgamerz Great news, but I guarantee you there's going to be a shitstorm headed their way really quick. Corbin Davenport Oh for sure. Something something free market. bekifft This is huge. However if they don't address the issue of deceptive ads, it's still a big problem. Hopefully one day I can finally in good conscience stop installing ad blockers as simply a security measure to protect my users. Corbin Davenport I haven't looked through all of the standard's documentation, but I don't see anything about deceptive ads. But I agree, that should be addressed. My1 not really android related but when these things like get 10000 euro in a month easily show up in SKYPE, an application by MICROSOFT that hurts, and they even have HTTPS ads with certificate errors Eli Stevens I get the job done from convenience of my place, with very simple projects that only needs only from you a Desktop computer system as well as web connection and I am happier than before...

"Which giant 'Download Here' button is the right one?! Oh, of course, it's the tiny text link buried between three of them." Santos Chavez Ugh, I hate those sites with a passion. They're part of the reason i vehemently block ads. Take your stupid large fake green buttons outta here, filths :3 Adriannacsmith Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Cat Astrophy Deceptive is extremely hard to deal with and far more subjective. "Bad" can be virus ridden, or employing technical methods that can be detected automatically (like pop ups). Gregory Will there be an option to block all ads without exceptions? Corbin Davenport Most likely not. Artem Russakovskii Sort of, but if you subscribe to sites running Funding Choices and use Contributor to buy an ad-free pass. Which is how it should be if you want to enjoy quality content from creators. Good ads and free if you don't. No ads and small fee if you do. Bimmer Ime or you can install an adblocker and enjoy no ads and no fee :) Tom Westrick And the sites you enjoy won't be able to sustain themselves... Nathan J Are they hurting now? Because that's what we have now. We have ad blockers, and we have ABP with its acceptable ads, but a lot of people turn it off. How about the sack on that guy, telling the main guy at AP to block ads on his own site? I'm a block-everything guy too, but I'm going to be seriously looking into this Funding Choices thing. I don't want my ad-free page views being wasted on just any old site, but sites I read daily, like AP and Neowin, I definitely want to see them get their cut. Cakefish ABP allows through Taboola, Outbrain and Revcontent. The polar opposite of acceptable ads. R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ That would kill the internet and you would have to pay for everything. Ads are what make the internet free Gregory You know, they can always make money on others, not on me. Most people don't bother blocking ads, they simply don't care. Mark Curtis Yeah gimme free entertainment, but YOU foot the bill! David The internet was in fact a much *worse* place before ads became a thing. All the nice stuff you have access to now only exists because of ad revenue (email, YouTube, any and all social networking platforms) Toys Samurai He reminds me of some people whom I know -- always say they hate ads and would rather pay for it. But when the content provider actually asks for money, they don't open up their wallets. Jorgen Phillips This is the most hippocritical thing I think I have ever read. Toys Samurai Exactly. This very site he's reading would not even exist if everyone blocks ads. David That's not true, they could just use a different monetization model. Nathan J Hypocritical. You may be thinking of the hippocratic oath, where the famous phrase "do no harm" comes from. If only ads would pledge to do no harm... abc You can pay for it and I'll coast for free. Ha ha, I'm a dick! Nathan J There already is. That's what we have now. I mean, we have the no ad blocker option, which is default. Then you have Adblock Plus's default setting, which whitelists ads ABP considers to be not malicious. And that's what Google is doing. Then you have ABP with that feature turned off, or something like uBlock Origin, that just blocks all the ads indiscriminately. This is a future measure that is designed to be more tolerant than current "all or nothing" solutions, plus Google is an advertising business. So, there probably won't be. Eddy Nelson Lopez They profit from it, why would they do it? 😂😂 Corbin Davenport They won't profit from it if a majority of users have an ad blocker. Which is where things are headed right now. exadeci They can blocks ads from everyone except theirs and having the most popular browser they can sell the exclusivity to other ad agencies. Corbin Davenport "In the post, Google confirmed that Chrome will soon not show ads, including those served by Google, on websites not in compliance with the Better Ads Standards." exadeci Couldn't they just prevent bad ads on their platform?! Imparus The problem is how you serve them to the user. If you create a popup filled with Google ads, it would be bad ads even thought they are Google approved ads. exadeci Right but if they can detect it in Chrome why can't they use this to disable the ads on the website that abuses it? Sonny Bono I'm guessing it's a preventative measure, seeing how many people get virused through some popup ads that they don't realize are a pathway to malicious software. We certainly don't want another epidemic of ransomware. I find most of my service calls go to elderly people who have no idea what they're doing and get tons of malware/ransomware. One old lady I was working with a few weeks ago actually "called microsoft" per the directions on her browser and gave them her credit card number. It wasn't really microsoft. abqnm As long as it takes care of the shady JavaScript click event pop-unders and other such js deceptive ad techniques which are generally not able to be caught by ad-blockers. I would really love to be able to go back to having JavaScript enabled and blacklist only certain sites rather than have to keep it disabled and whitelist the majority of my internet experience. TW Does this mean my phone won't connect constantly start vibrating because of ads on legitimate sites? raazman I'm sorry you have to experience this is this day and age. AintaDamnThingFunny This!! I've always wondered how those got through Chrome's security. I mean, it's an obtrusive add that makes your phone vibrate, and all you can do is close out the browser. How the hell do those get through and how has Google not stopped this from happening? Imparus Because a website can access the vibrator API, this is useful in the example of facebook, where you can activate notification for the site, and not having to use their shitty app. TW Now I know what to call the thing I hate: Vibrator API Total Insecurity For some reason female users like this API... BRO i prefer my phone silent, no notification sound or vibration, as i mostly use my pc with pushbullet mirroring My1 what the hell, how about they just pop a notif and let the phone do the rest? Imparus Okay so it was a bad example with facebook, since it is the notification API they are using not the vibration one, which means it follows the same rules as other applications. I should just have said a game might use it, but at the moment it is mainly used for BS ads. My1 okay, but I see no point in point in using the vibration on a website anyway. Imparus PWA, I mentioned game, since PWA is one of the new thing that is very likely to become huge in the next few years. Here you can try some few application made in it https://pwa.rocks/ so it is more that you should be ready for a paradigm change in what a website is, since the line between webapp and normal app will almost disappear. Example I use the QR scanner, so I don't have to have a dedicated app for it. My1 well honestly I think the PWA stuff is taking it too far, especially games, I mean dont they run better when compiled and optimized for an OS? also websites are supposed to work on any device that has a more or less modern browser and when games need for example multitouch, that thing is not really funny on a device without touch, since I cant summon a second mouse arrow. and when websites are starting to lose the point of working pretty much everywhere and becoming a gimmick it's starting to get stupid. especially if you have a bad internet connection these PWAs arent as great as when you just have your application. with the browser opening more and more, it's seriously going to risk opening itself to viruses and stuff Imparus I unfortunately don't have the time at the moment to explain all of these to you, so this will be quick rundown, and the rest you will have to research yourself if you are interested in it. "well honestly I think the PWA stuff is taking it too far, especially games, I mean dont they run better when compiled and optimized for an OS? " For most stuff it isn't a problem at all, as for game if they are simple enough optimization isn't as relevant. Most game would be written for an engine like unity or unreal, and one of the new thing in relation to PWA are modules, that will allow the use of engine like that, it also allow webapps to work completely offline. There will of course be some apps that are very heavy in computation on device that will make sense to run with native code that can run better, but there are being worked on optimizing things such as JS to make it run faster. "also websites are supposed to work on any device that has a more or less modern browser and when games need for example multitouch, that thing is not really funny on a device without touch, since I cant summon a second mouse arrow." You can have the browser serve different code depending on the device, that actually isn't anything new. "and when websites are starting to lose the point of working pretty much everywhere and becoming a gimmick it's starting to get stupid. " PWA actually allow apps to work everywhere, instead of just the OS you coded it to. Having one single code base would be great for pretty much every company. "especially if you have a bad internet connection these PWAs arent as great as when you just have your application." You can easily code for it to work offline, take the QR scanner on the side I linked you, I don't need internet to use it at all. Think of PWA like normal apps, if you use twitter then try using the PWA they have created. "with the browser opening more and more, it's seriously going to risk opening itself to viruses and stuff" Not really, this is one of the thing I will say you need to research yourself, since it will be quite a long explanation, I would start by looking into why chromeOS is more secure than Windows. I said there will be a huge grow with PWA over the next few years, since it is still very early in its development, only Firefox and Chrome support it at the moment and Edge will bring support in fall. AintaDamnThingFunny Right, but websites always ask me for permission if I want their notifications. Facebook using the vibrator API with your permission is one thing. Having an obtrusive add use it without your permission is another. Imparus That is because a website don't need to ask for permission, so it is more that Google should make it a permission check before allowing to use the vibration. Santos Chavez OMG I hate those types of ads! Especially when the ads that popup are so obstrusive I can't do anything but exit Chrome. Ugh! Rob Yeah, but some people love the vibrator API. hooch Holy shit I didn't even know this was a thing. Been using Firefox + uBlock Origin for a couple of years. blindexecutioner Doesn't affect me much. I already block ads. Nathan J It's not meant to affect you or I or anyone else who knows what uBlock Origin is. Google Chrome is the most popular browser, so I imagine what it will affect is the 60% or however many people use Chrome, and all of a sudden they're blocking malicious ads. That will affect a lot. I suspect for you and I, we will probably be able to just disable Google's solution and use our own, and if Google blocks other ad blockers, there's always Chromium. AS The biggest annoyances for me are subscribe popovers and EU cookie warnings. Things like taboola and outbrain need to be aggressively blocked. My1 cookie warning are annoying but it shows the scary relatity of all the sites that collect data with cookies. Lateef Alabi-Oki I'll disable my ad blocker if this gets rid of malicious and egregious ads. Nexus Hexus I'm sure most of these "Bad ads" will be alternative media. Or aka "Whatever we don't agree with" boop It's not content that's blocked, but format. Sonny Bono Ironically, all the ads that I find bothersome are on google services themselves, such as YouTube, but I have a Chrome extension (ublock origin) that works to get rid of them. Santos Chavez I enjoy YouTube so much, I pay for YouTube Red, via the Google Play Music Family Plan . Haven't seen an ad, especially on mobile. for months, and I get unlimited music streaming and downloading, all of those features shared to 5 other users. Pretty neat. Sonny Bono If they throw in free movies with the service I'd be down. I can already get anything I want on demand for no cost. I just appreciate watching random videos and I never know what I'm in the mood for. I'll just keep riding the links down the chain, bar tricks, gun porn, rocket engines, science experiments, old computers, animals and hunting videos... whatever it might be. ublock origin fixes the problem with ads - they don't exist any more - but not with popup windows on some questionable websites. abc Good for you. I use an adblocker and don't see any ads on Youtube. And I don't feel bad taking cents away from a multi-billion dollar corporation. I will never pay for streaming services because I like to own things. I could pay Netflix hundreds of dollars over the course of years, and the moment I disconnect, I am left with zero movies. I'd much rather grab some discs from the bargain bin. Gary But do they block those annoying as hell forced Google surveys? Adam Margeson Forced Google surveys? Where are you seeing those served up? And, are you sure they're legitimately from Google? Lord Argyris "...Google confirmed that Chrome will soon not show ads, including those served by Google, on websites not in compliance with the Better Ads Standards." I'm going to guess they're including their own ads here to avoid anticompetitive suits from competing ad providers. If they just blocked the other ads and left their own (presumably compliant ads), they would be gaining an unfair advantage and could be seen to be leveraging their strength in the browser market to incentivize use of their own ad platform. I wondered about this in my comment on the previous AP article on the subject, and it seems Google has considered the matter as well. Santos Chavez Yeah, it's kinda neat; by doing it that way Google avoids all sorts of blames of being hypocrites while also setting the example for everyone. "THIS", they say, "is how ads should be done. Look, we're even doing them to our own; you should, too". Terra Remove the ads that play before a video and we got a deal. Small banners below the video? Ok. Playing a commercial before the content I actually want to see? That is old tv bullcrap and is annoying as hell, even more so than popups. Dennis Ulijn "But, but, but... Terra: how would you solve this on Chromecast, etc.?" tigerberry Playing a commercial WHILE PLAYING THE DAMN VIDEO I'M ACTUALLY WATCHING? Whoever came up with that should be forced to never use an adblocker ever again. Cakefish Wonderful. Please also add extension support to Android Chrome (it's the number 1 feature that it's missing, desktop Chrome wouldn't have been as popular without it) but this is a good start. Ghirahim Install Opera and have a wonderful life. Jun rip pornhub ads Rod I wonder when they will fix the Notification Download Service bug in v58. https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=719641# Rob Thank goodness. Somehow, we went from doing away with auto-play videos and ads years ago, only to have them pop up a lot in recent months. I'm sick of them. BC Google is finally making a move that I truly approve of. Ads, especially the invasive ones have really taken over. I don't care about banner ads that I see just once or ads on the side. The ones that infuriate me the most are those that obscure content, automatically play loud sounds/videos. Those that try to trick the user into installing something they don't obviously need, need to die in a fire. It's why I've installed Ghostery and use Mercury Reader to banish that bullshit to the depths of the internet hell. I'm also pleased that Google is being smart about this and blocking all invasive content...Even if it comes directly from their company because they need to be impartial and control these insanely bad adverts. Forcing a standard will hopefully make the internet a cleaner place, one that can support the advert model without being deliberately invasive or deceptive. Dragos Lucian The only thing that makes me use an adblocker on a lot of websites, is because, more often than not, you don't even need to click on the ads to be presented with a buttload of new tabs or individual pages. You just need to click on a blank area and boom ! You can barely make your way back to the page you initially were. If those type of ads go away, then I'll make sure to uninstall my adblocker. Till then, fuck everyone who posts those type of ads on their websites in order to gain revenue. Make your money off selling socks. Abhishek Mittal Does this mean my phone wont start buzzing and downloading unwanted apps without my permission? This is huge, a great step by google in improving quality of the internet Spinkick Does it bother anyone that google is the one that decides which ads are bad? abc Google means that they are going to block their competitors ads and only allow their own.

To these groups, ad blockers are public enemy number one, and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) plans to do something about ad blockers — like make them go away. According to a report from PageFair, 11% of global desktop and mobile devices (numbering 615 million) were using ad-blockers at the end of 2016. Year-over-year growth in ad-blocker usage last year reached 39%. In 2015, ad-blockers cost publishers $21.8 billion in revenues. Google conducted its own survey and found that 63% of users installed an ad blocker because there are just too many ads. Nearly half (48%) installed an ad blocker because they found the ads annoying. With an eye to stopping the spread of ad blockers, an industry group called the Coalition for Better Ads tested six types of desktop ads and 12 types of mobile ads to find out which ones are driving users crazy. The survey found four types of desktop ads and six types of mobile ads that “fall beneath a threshold of user acceptability.” Google announced Thursday how it plans to support the coalition’s guidance. To that end, beginning early next year, Google’s Chrome browser will stop showing ads (including those owned or served by Google) on websites that do not compliant with standards established by the coalition. The company is issuing a guide that includes screenshots and videos of annoying ads. Google also has created a list of best practices illustrating the types of ads that consumers can put up with. The company also is testing something called Funding Choices, a program that allows publishers to ask consumers who are using an ad blocker either to let the publisher display ads or to pay a fee to remove all ads from the site using a new Google program called Google Contributor. Google’s in a tough spot here. On one hand, it wants its Chrome browser to be used by as many people as possible and to accomplish that it is going to force advertisers to comply with some standards. On the other hand, if Google doesn’t do something the proliferation of ad blockers (growing at a rate of 30% a year, remember) threatens the company’s bread and butter revenue stream. A choice between making a few advertisers angry and facing an existential crisis is really an easy choice to make.

Why? Well, it officially closed down a few months ago. So for Google to use titles and descriptions from a service that is no longer updated is update makes little sense. In fact, Google should have probably dropped support years ago because DMOZ was not that good at keeping their links updated. I guess, this is one of the reasons DMOZ closed down. Google wrote: With DMOZ now closed, we've stopped using its listings for snippeting, so it's a lot more important that webmasters provide good meta descriptions, if adding more content to the page is not an option. What will happen with the "NOODP" robots directive? Google said "with DMOZ (ODP) closed, we stopped relying on its data and thus the NOODP directive is already no-op." So Google really is depending a lot of the web page itself to make the description, so they want you to read this help document on how to help Google tailor your snippets. Google began supporting the noodp directive back in 2006 and used DMOZ descriptions since before that. So this is an historic moment. Forum discussion at Twitter.

Home > Google News > Google SEO > Google: No Plans For Mobile-First Index Test Sandbox Preview Google: No Plans For Mobile-First Index Test Sandbox Preview Jun 2, 2017 • 8:03 am | (4) by Barry Schwartz | Filed Under Google Search Engine Optimization Prev Story Next story Tweet Pin It   Prev Story Next Story Before Google made a massive index change in 2009 or so named Caffeine, Google released a public sandbox for you to preview the changes in the search results based on this index change. In short, it gave people like you and I a way to see how the new index will impact the rankings in the Google results before it went live. It also gave Google a way for them to get feedback from us on the new index before the real Googler users saw it live. John Mueller of Google was asked if we would see the same thing with this new massive index change, the mobile-first index. John Mueller said no, "I don't see that happening," he said. He said he would bring the idea to the team though. What was interesting is that when Google did announce the mobile-first index, they said they launched it on a very small level to a small percentage of searchers. That is how Google typically tests these roll outs now. But maybe it makes sense to do a public preview so us webmasters and SEOs can give Google some straight feedback? I don't see that happening, but it's an interesting idea worth discussing with the team.— John ☆.o(≧▽≦)o.☆ (@JohnMu) June 2, 2017 Forum discussion at Twitter.

Home > Google News > Misc Google > Google Ad Experience Report Tools Detect Annoying Ads On Your Site Google Ad Experience Report Tools Detect Annoying Ads On Your Site Jun 2, 2017 • 8:21 am | (8) by Barry Schwartz | Filed Under Other Google Topics Prev Story Next story Tweet Pin It   Prev Story Next Story Google announced last night a new initiative to block annoying ads on the internet. That means two things (a) new tools for publishers to improve their ad experience and (b) Chrome can stop showing ads to users automatically. I wanted to focus on one of the new tools named the Ad Experience Report. The tool is accessible in any of your Google Search Console verified properties by going here. When you click through, you see the option to pick a profile and you are then taken to this screen that gives you an overview of the report: It reads: See if the ad experiences on your site violate the Better Ads Standards or mislead your visitors. The Ad Experience Report is designed to identify ad experiences that violate the Better Ads Standards, a set of ad experiences the industry has identified as being highly annoying to users, and egregious ad experiences, which are ad experiences that are misleading or abusive. If your site presents either type, the Ad Experience Report may identify the issues to fix. If your site is out of compliance with the Better Ads Standards, or if it has egregious ad experiences, you can fix the issues and then request a review of your site. To see if your site has been reviewed, click on Desktop or Mobile to review the respective report. Sadly, all the individual profiles I click through to, all say not reviewed yet. Here is an example from this site: Google has a large help area on this over here. There are three primary issues your site can have including creative issues, site design issues and egregious ad experiences: These include: Autoplaying Video Ad with Sound Autoplaying Video Ad with Sound Flashing Animated Ad Pop-up ads Prestitial ad with countdown Large sticky ad at bottom of screen Pop-up Ad and Prestitial Ad Ad density higher than 30% Postitial Ad with Countdown Full Screen Scrollover Ad Large Sticky Ad It promotes, hosts, or links to malware or unwanted software that may be installed on the user’s machine. It is “phishing” for users’ information. It auto-redirects the page without user action. It misleads or tricks the user into interacting with it. Examples include: Ads that resemble system or site warnings or error messages. Ads that simulate messages, dialog boxes, menus, or request notifications. Hosted ads that are indistinguishable from other content. Ads depicting features that do not work. Ads with a transparent background. Ads with an image that is segmented, an image that contains multiple copies of itself within the ad, or images that appear to be more than one ad. Ads with moving and clicking arrows. Ads with a “close” button that does not close the ad but instead clicks the ad, or clicks through to other content. Ads where clicking anywhere outside of the user-visible border of the ad leads to an ad landing page. So keep an eye on that report.

TrustedReviews Facebook Twitter Googleplus TVs & Audio Cameras Computing Mobile Home appliances Gaming Huawei Competitions Desktop PCs Internet Laptops Monitors PC Components Peripherals More Printers Routers & Networking Software Trending: Nintendo Switch OnePlus 5 iPhone 7 deals Galaxy S8 LG G6 iPhone 8 Home / News / Internet News / Google confirms native ad-blocker for Chrome will arrive next year Google confirms native ad-blocker for Chrome will arrive next year by Joe Roberts 02 June 2017 0 shares Read Comments Earlier this year a Wall Street Journal report contained claims from anonymous sources that Google was working on a native ad-blocker for its Chrome web browser. And now, the company has confirmed the news, announcing that a built-in ad-blocker will be arriving from Chrome next year. In a blog post, Sridhar Ramaswamy, Google's Senior VP of Ads and Commerce explained how the new feature is designed to stop websites "showing ads (including those owned or served by Google) on websites that are not compliant with the Better Ads Standards starting in early 2018." Related: Best VPN As the Wall Street Journal previously reported, ad-blocking has been taken up by 26% of US users on desktop devices, as preventing unwanted adverts from showing becomes increasingly popular. Google's latest move looks designed to prevent further growth of third-party ad-blocking tools and give the company more control in general. Chrome's built-in blocker won't prevent all ads from showing automatically, however. Rather, it will only block ads that have been assessed as being particularly irritating or intrusive for users. If a web page has too many ads, the promotions will also be blocked, with videos that are set to autoplay and full-screen ads said to be targeted as part of the new feature – set to launch on both desktop and mobile. The Coalition for Better Ads, made up of members such as Google, Facebook, and News Corp, is said to be deciding which ads will be deemed intrusive. The feature's more discerning approach is likely why Google is referring to it as a "filter" rather than an ad-blocker. To help companies prepare ahead of the filter's rollout, Google is also providing a new tool that will tell publishers if their ads are in violation of the standards. What's more, to accompany the new Chrome feature, Google also announced Funding Choices – a tool that will allow publishers to display a message asking users to whitelist their site if they're deemed to be using an ad-blocker. Funding Choices will also allow the publisher to offer users the option to buy a subscription to remove all ads through the Google Contributor service.

Things started to change under Google's ownership with the immensely successful 'G' series of budget phones and the unique 'X' series that laid more emphasis on usability and optimisation than raw specifications alone. While sales began to pick up in countries like India, Motorola was still known as a bottom denominator in the west. Back in 2014, Motorola's ownership changed hands from Google to Lenovo. Lenovo's tenure has been very uneven, with the company facing difficulties in bringing together the Moto and Lenovo line-up, differentiating and streamlining the two and establishing a unique identity of Lenovo owned Motorola. In fact, Lenovo publicly admitted last year that they underestimated how difficult it would be to integrate their 2014 acquisition of Motorola Mobility's handset business. While devices like the Moto X Style , Moto G3 and Moto X Play were launched under Lenovo's ownership, it wasn't until the Moto Z and Moto G4 that we saw Lenovo's design ethos start to percolate through. The Moto Z and Moto Z Play were striking smartphones that brought with them the Moto Mods which were widely appreciated as a practical implementation of the modular phone concept. But both phones brought with them compromises. The Moto Z had top of the line specifications but sacrificed on essentials like the headphone jack in favour of extreme slimness while the Moto Z Play was relatively under-powered and was a little too bulky. The Moto Z2 Play slots in perfectly between the two and seems like the type of phone Lenovo owned Motorola should have been making from the very beginning. Motorola has managed to make it almost as slim as last year's Moto Z  without having to sacrifice the iconic 3.5mm headphone jack. The specs have seen a much needed boost as well with an updated processor, more RAM and new camera units. Talking about the Moto Z2 Play's specifications in detail, it is powered by an octa-core Snapdragon 626 processor clocked at 2.2GHz paired with either 3 or 4GB of RAM depending on the variant. Additionally, the smartphone comes with a 5.5-inch fullHD SuperAMOLED display with Corning Glass 3on top for scratch protection and 32/64GB of internal storage which can be expanded via a microSD card (of upto 2TB). Lenovo has even tweaked the design a little bit in order to make it more ergonomic and user friendly. The scratch prone glass back of the Z Play has gone and in its place is a sleek metal back panel. Additionally, the front fingerprint sensor is now much larger and easier to use and the edges have become bit more rounded. Even the cameras are much improved. The Z2 Play comes with a 12MP camera at the rear which has a brighter lens with an aperture of f/1.7, an improved laser focusing system and dual pixel focusing. The front camera is 5MP affair with an aperture of f/2.2. With a unique and slim design, capable internals, Moto Mods and near stock Android, the Moto Z2 Play looks like the best and most complete smartphone Lenovo owned Motorola has ever made Between the Moto Z and Moto Z2 Play, Lenovo has released a slew of smartphones - Moto G4 Play, Moto M, Moto G5, Moto G5 Plus and the recently launched Moto C. Out of these, the Moto M was seen as largely unnecessary with a design language that was too much of a departure from Motorola's of old and under-powered hardware. The Moto G5 and Moto G5 Plus on the other hand have been widely hailed for their metal designs, stock Android and strong cameras and specifications for the price. Both the Moto G5 Plus and the Moto Z2 represent a more focused Lenovo that seems to have finally found a way to be unique and different without sacrificing the soul of Motorola Mobility. The Moto C also has its place in the line-up as an entry level Motorola smartphone. In the past, Motorola has released multiple phones that cannibalised each others like the G4 Play and Moto E series. Now. Lenovo should now avoid flooding the market with multitude of smartphones that are barely recognisable from each other and build upon solid, recognisable product lines like the Z series, C series and G series. Coming back to the Moro Z2 Play, it is a very solid smartphone which has its own distinct personality thanks to the slim industrial design and Motorola's Moto Mods. Yes the Z2 Play does not have the power of the OnePlus 3T or the design flair of the Galaxy S8 or LG G6, but it does offer a pretty compelling overall package. It has a unique and slim design, capable internals, unlimited expansion capabilities with Moto Mods and the appeal of near stock Android. While a full and final judgement will have to wait till we can get our hands on the device, for now it surely looks like the best and most complete smartphone Lenovo owned Motorola has ever made.

Apple’s WWDC Announcements: What are the chances? Video WWDC 2017: Our Top 3 Predictions Apple’s iOS has become a main pillar of its ever-expanding ecosystem. It was the inspiration for creating a tvOS that revolved around apps. And without iOS, watchOS would be inoperable.  Some of Apple’s best features were first fine-tuned on iOS before migrating to the other operating systems. Siri, for example, is now present in macOS, tvOS, and watchOS. And Apple Pay, another iOS-first, has found its way to the Apple Watch and the MacBook Pro. That’s why during the WWDC keynote on June 5, all eyes will be on iOS 11, and whatever Apple has planned for the latest iteration of the influential operating system. For our iOS 11 wish list, we’ve come up with a list of awesome features that will certainly take iOS to the next level, but would also play nice with the other OSes. FaceTime group calling When Steve Jobs announced FaceTime back in 2010, it was groundbreaking. Reliable video calls on your mobile device were the future. But FaceTime hasn’t been updated much since then. Now, Facebook and Google have mobile video-calling, too, with Facebook Messenger and Google Hangouts. While FaceTime continues to only support two-way video calling, Facebook Messenger lets you video-call up to 50 people. MyApple Hopefully, iOS 11 will bring FaceTime up to speed and integrate group calling. Rumors have circulated that this much-needed feature is indeed coming to iOS, but obviously nothing’s been confirmed. But if Apple does not launch support for group video calls soon, it’s possible that FaceTime will start loosing its luster… kind of like Skype. Expanded SiriKit Integrations Last year, with iOS 10, Apple made one of the biggest updates to Siri by allowing it to access selected third-party services. All of the sudden, Siri could hail you an Uber or send a message via WhatsApp. It was a great move in trying to make Siri smarter. However, Amazon’s Alexa has Siri beat in this department. Amazon has given its voice assistant access to thousands of third-party “Skills.” While Siri continues to only be able to perform six types of actions. Not to mention, Google Assistant just launched on iOS, as well, making iPhone users more aware of Siri’s shortcomings in deciphering context. If Apple is indeed developing a Siri Speaker to compete against Amazon Echo, then improving Siri in iOS 11 is vital. iMessage P2P payments Despite all these competitors, Apple continues to be number one in terms of user privacy and security. That’s why the Siri integrations have lagged behind. It’s also why Apple should integrate peer-to-peer mobile payments into iMessage, giving iPhone users a more-trusted alternative to Venmo. Venmo Sure, iMessage got a major overhaul in iOS 10, bringing bigger emojis, stickers, and third-party apps. But I was disappointed by the lack of practical applications. In iOS 11, iMessage could be integrated into Apple Pay to facilitate mobile payments in a way that’s secure and convenient. Augmented Reality app Tim Cook has mentioned several times how excited he is about augmented reality. Most likely, we’ll see augmented reality integrated somehow into the forthcoming iPhone 8, but I hope Apple will give us a hint of those AR features in iOS 11. Gabor Balogh Instead of clogging the camera app or Siri, Apple could launch a new standalone app dedicated entirely to launching augmented reality experiences. I’d love to see an iOS app that combines Siri, Clips, and the camera’s viewfinder to surface information or overlay graphics onto the real world (or on your 3D selfies). Samsung has already promised a version of this for Galaxy users with Bixby Vision. And more recently, Google Lens was the most interesting thing to come out of Google’s I/O developers conference. Could Siri Vision be that far behind? Customizable Control Center I use the Control Center more than I do the widgets on the Today screen. I swipe up every time I want to take a picture or use the calculator. I even use Control Center late at night when I’m on my iPhone and want to lock the portrait orientation of the screen. But then there are Control Center actions that I never take, like setting a timer. EverythingApplePro This didn’t use to be that big of a deal before iOS 10, when the Control Center was just one panel. Now, there are so many controls that I wish I could remove some of them, or at least re-arrange them. That way I could keep all my preferred controls (including the play button) on the same panel. In addition, I would also replace the Night Shift control, which takes up way to much space, with a control to turn on Low-Power Mode. That’s something that I need to turn on more often than Night Shift, which comes on automatically anyway. Set default apps When tapping a link, some iOS apps give you a choice. Do you want to open that link in Safari or Chrome? Do you want to navigate to this destination using Apple Maps or Google Maps? My question is: Wouldn’t it be nice if iOS 11 would let you set your default apps to get rid of such prompts? It would eliminate an extra step. I’m surprised we haven’t gotten this option just yet, considering simplicity is what Apple is all about. Drag-and-drop for iPad The iPad got a productivity boost in iOS 9 with Slide Over, Split View, and Picture-in-Picture. But that was two years ago, and it seems like Apple has stopped adding new multitasking features, or even fine-tuning existing ones. This is terribly disappointing, especially when you think of all the missed opportunities for making the iPad Pro models even better. MacStories A simple, yet much-needed multitasking feature that iOS 11 can bring about is drag-and-drop in Split View. Visually, I’m already tempted to drag photos and documents from one app to another when they’re right next to each other. And other third-party apps have already figured out how this can be done. Readdle’s latest update makes it possible to drag-and-drop files between their productivity apps like Spark, Documents, and PDF Expert.

Android co-founder’s new company Essential Inc may be looking to create a pair of smart glasses similar to Google Glass and Snapchat Spectacles. An old patent filing, discovered by Patenty Apple shows a pair of eyeglasses, with camera and display builtin. The Essential Smart Glasses sports a camera under its ‘dual-mode’ display. Just like Glass Glass, the smart glasses allow users to capture photo and video with a built-in camera. The filing describes the smart glasses would be compatible with prescription lenses, photolenses and sunglass-lenses. Essential is also working on to make augmented reality (AI) to its smart glasses. Essential notes that “Based on the environment that the user sees, and based on the direction of the user’s gaze, the processor can display an image to augment the environment around the user. For example, if the user is looking at a barcode of an item, the processor can display cheaper purchasing options of the same item.” While Google Glass didn’t take off, Andy Rubin might have a better product to offer. In an interview with the Wired, Rubin mentioned that the failure of Google Glass was not due to the tech but because there wasn’t a market for such product.  It’s interesting to hear that Rubin still believes in the smart glasses segment, and the Essential Smart Glasses patent just shows the company’s interest to enter the unexplored territory. If that happens, it just shows how Rubin sees the future hardware that’s tightly connected and integrated to each other.  The head of Essential, his later venture, promises to make cutting edge hardware and software. Rubin’s company recently unveiled a $699 Android smartphone called the Essential. The high-end smartphone is made out of titanium and ceramic and features  a magnetic modular connector on the back to support a range of attachments, including a 360-degree camera and a charging dock. Rubin also unveiled the intelligent assistant device – the Home. Essential Home is a voice-activated smart home device that rivals Amazon Echo and Google Home. The smart hub runs on a new operating system that Rubin calls Ambient OS.

Computing Phones Cars Gaming Science Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Mobile Essential Phone vs. Samsung Galaxy S8: Battle of the New Flagships Essential Phone vs. Samsung Galaxy S8: Battle of the New Flagships By Ryan Whitwam on June 2, 2017 at 7:15 am Comment Andy Rubin is famous for founding Android, which was later acquired by Google and turned into the largest computing platform on Earth. He left Google several years ago to look for new challenges, and now he’s arrived back in the Android ecosystem with a startup known as Essential. The company revealed its first phone this week after teasing it several weeks previously. The Essential Phone has a crazy edge-to-edge screen, a titanium frame, and the latest Qualcomm chip. This phone looks like it could even give the Galaxy S8 a run for its money, so let’s see how they stack up. Display Samsung’s Galaxy S8 has a 5.8-inch curved AMOLED panel that’s taller than other phones. The 18.5:9 aspect ratio offers more space than a regular 16:9 display in this chassis would. That helps it fill more of the available space, and the edges that curve downward make it comfortable to hold. Samsung calls this an “infinity display.” The resolution is 2960 x 1440, which is among the highest available on a phone. Essential has a similar goal of cramming as much screen into its phone as possible. This phone has a 5.7-inch flat LCD panel. It’ll be 2560 x 1312 with a 19:10 ratio. However, it goes all the way to the edge of the phone — for real. There are only a few millimeters separating the display from the edge, but that comes with a trade-off. The front-facing camera takes a chunk out of the display right in the top center. It’s certainly an interesting design choice. The Essential phone has a cool take on the shrinking the bezel, but Samsung’s AMOLED is a known quantity, and it’s great. LCDs tend to have duller colors and slower response time, making VR impractical. So, advantage Samsung on this one. Internals These phones will share a lot on the inside, and that’s what counts, isn’t it? Both phones have a Snapdragon 835 with 4GB of RAM. The Galaxy S8 is tuned to be more power efficient, so it doesn’t feel as fast as you might expect for a device with such a powerful chip. We don’t know what Essential will do with the 835, but there’s room to leave the GS8 in the dust. The Essential Phone will ship with 128GB of storage, but the Galaxy S8 is only 64GB. Most markets don’t have a higher-capacity variant, either. Both phones use high-speed UFS storage, which is much faster than a removable card. In fact, the Essential phone doesn’t have expandable storage at all. Samsung’s phone has a microSD card slot if you don’t mind the slower speeds. Essential might be able to meet the needs of most users with so much built-in storage, but some people will never give up the microSD card slot. Still, a Snapdragon 835 tuned for performance could be enough to put Essential over the top. Design Samsung’s Galaxy S8 is a beautiful piece of engineering with its aluminum and glass body. The glass rear panel curves up to meet the curved front, giving the overall device a rounded, comfy feel. The Essential Phone, by contrast, is a flat slab, but it’s made from materials we don’t often see in smartphones. The frame will be titanium, which is much more durable than aluminum. Aluminum will scratch and dent if you drop it, but titanium remains unblemished. The back panel is ceramic, which (depending on the structure) can be much lighter and stronger than glass. Samsung has opted to stick with the headphone jack for at least one more generation, but the Essential Phone is living in a jack-less future. It only has a Type-C port, but you can use a 3.5mm adapter. It does, however, include a fingerprint sensor in the right place on the back of the phone. That’s the same location used by the Pixel, LG G6, and others. Samsung placed it way up next to the camera, which is terrible. The Galaxy S8 is a pretty phone, but the new materials Essential is bringing to the table are intriguing. I think Essential has an advantage here. Software Samsung’s TouchWiz interface used to be the definition of bad design, but it’s gotten much better over the years. It still lacks the sensible interface of stock Android, but Samsung has at least made its myriad of features comprehensible. The color palette is also more elegant. Meanwhile, Essential aims to launch its phone with a nearly stock version of Android. That’s probably a good thing. One potential concern is what’s going to become of Essential in a year? Samsung will be around to update the Galaxy S8, even though it might take longer than you’d like. Maybe Essential will crash and burn, or maybe it will pivot to other devices. It’s a new player with a lot of unknowns. Essential is in a position to provide a great Android experience, though. Cameras The Galaxy S8 only has one 12MP camera on the rear as more and more phones implement dual cameras. However, it’s a really good camera. Focus is incredibly fast, colors are accurate, HDR mode is effective, and even low-light shots are good. In my experience, it’s a close second to the Pixel. The Essential Phone has two rear-facing cameras, which it says are the thinnest dual sensors ever created. Essential is doing the same thing Huawei does with its Leica-branded dual cameras. There’s a 13MP RGB sensor paired with a 13MP monochrome sensor. The monochrome sensor is great at capturing detail, and more sensors equals more light. The output from both sensors is combined in software to give you an (allegedly) great photo. It’s hard to say who’s going to win here. Camera performance varies hugely based on software, so we’ll have to wait and see. Still, Essential has some cool ideas. Modularity The Essential Phone has one feature with no analog on the Galaxy S8: an accessory connector. On the back panel of the phone are two small pins that power Essential’s accessories, of which only one has been announced. When buying an Essential phone, you can add a 360-degree camera for $50. It attaches magnetically to the back, and you’re all set. The accessory transmits data to the phone wirelessly with a special RF module. The result is a USB 3.1 connection without the plug. This could be cool for various accessories, but all we have so far is the camera. Hopefully Essential shows off some more ways to make use of that connector. It has more potential than other modular accessory systems. Cost and availability Just looking at the hardware Essential has on offer, the $699 asking price seems like a good deal. Titanium and ceramic are not cheap, and the phone has specs on the same level as the Galaxy S8. You’re looking at $750 for Samsung’s phone, or $850 if you upgrade to the Galaxy S8 Plus. Samsung’s devices are more widely available, though. You can get a Galaxy S8 from any carrier or from Samsung unlocked. Essential is only selling the Essential Phone on its website, but it’s unlocked. It says carrier partnerships are coming later, but it might take longer than anyone expects.

Now we are on the cusp of a new grand leap thanks to the democratization of machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn without being explicitly programmed. This process of democratization is already underway, according to this opinion piece by Kartik Hosanagar (@khosanagar), Wharton professor of operations, information and decisions, and a cofounder of Yodle Inc., and, Apoorv Saxena (@apoorvsaxena1), a product manager at Google and co-chair of the recent AI Frontiers conference. Last month, at the CloudNext conference in San Francisco, Google announced its acquisition of Kaggle, an online community for data scientists and machine-learning competitions. Although the move may seem far removed from Google’s core businesses, it speaks to the skyrocketing industry interest in machine learning (ML). Kaggle not only gives Google access to a talented community of data scientists, but also one of the largest repositories of datasets that will help train the next generation of machine-learning algorithms. As ML algorithms solve bigger and more complex problems, such as language translation and image understanding, training them can require massive amounts of pre-labeled data. To increase access to such data, Google had previously released a labeled dataset created from more than 7 million YouTube videos as part of their YouTube-8M challenge on Kaggle. The acquisition of Kaggle is an interesting next step. Market-based access to data and algorithms will lower entry barriers and lead to an explosion in new applications of AI. As recently as 2015, only large companies like Google, Amazon and Apple had access to the massive data and computing resources needed to train and launch sophisticated AI algorithms. Small startups and individuals simply didn’t have access and were effectively blocked out of the market. That changes now. The democratization of ML gives individuals and startups a chance to get their ideas off the ground and prove their concepts before raising the funds needed to scale. But access to data is only one way in which ML is being democratized. There is an effort underway to standardize and improve access across all layers of the machine learning stack, including specialized chipsets, scalable computing platforms, software frameworks, tools and ML algorithms. “Just like cloud computing ushered in the current explosion in startups … machine learning platforms will likely power the next generation of consumer and business tools.” Specialized chipsets Complex machine-learning algorithms require an incredible amount of computing power, both to train models and implement them in real time. Rather than using general-purpose processors that can handle all kinds of tasks, the focus has shifted towards building specialized hardware that is custom built for ML tasks. With Google’s Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) and NVIDIA’s DGX-1, we now have powerful hardware built specifically for machine learning. Sponsored Content: Highly scalable computing platforms Even if specialized processors were available, not every company has the capital and skills needed to manage a large-scale computing platform needed to run advanced machine learning on a routine basis. This is where public cloud services such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure and others come in. These services offer developers a scalable infrastructure optimized for ML on rent and at a fraction of the cost of setting up on their own. Open-source, deep-learning software frameworks A major issue in the wide-scale adoption of machine learning is that there are many different software frameworks out there. Big companies are open sourcing their core ML frameworks and trying to push for some standardization. Just as the cost of developing mobile apps fell dramatically as iOS and Android emerged as the two dominant ecosystems, so too will machine learning become more accessible as tools and platforms standardize around a few frameworks. Some of the notable open source frameworks include Google’s TensorFlow, Amazon’s MXNet and Facebook’s Torch. Developer-friendly tools The final step to democratization of machine learning will be the development of simple drag-and-drop frameworks accessible to those without doctorate degrees or deep data science training. Microsoft Azure ML Studio offers access to many sophisticated ML models through a simple graphical UI. Amazon and Google have rolled out similar software on their cloud platforms as well. Marketplaces for ML algorithms and datasets Not only do we have an on-demand infrastructure needed to build and run ML algorithms, we even have marketplaces for the algorithms themselves. Need an algorithm for face recognition in images or to add color to black and white photographs? Marketplaces like Algorithmia let you download the algorithm of choice. Further, websites like Kaggle provide the massive datasets one needs to further train these algorithms. “The final step to democratization of machine learning will be the development of simple drag-and-drop frameworks accessible.” All of these changes mean that the world of machine learning is no longer restricted to university labs and corporate research centers that have access to massive training data and computing infrastructure. What are the implications? Back in the mid- and late-1990s, web development was done by specialists and was accessible only to firms with ample resources. Now, with simple tools like WordPress, Medium and Shopify, any lay person can have a presence on the web. The democratization of machine learning will have a similar impact of lowering entry barriers for individuals and startups. Further, the emerging ecosystem, consisting of marketplaces for data, algorithms and computing infrastructure, will also make it easier for developers to pick up ML skills. The net result will be lower costs to train and hire talent. We think that the above two factors will be particularly powerful in vertical (industry-specific) use cases such as weather forecasting, healthcare/disease diagnostics, drug discovery and financial risk assessment that have been traditionally cost prohibitive. Just like cloud computing ushered in the current explosion in startups, the ongoing build-out of machine learning platforms will likely power the next generation of consumer and business tools. The PC platform gave us access to productivity applications like Word and Excel and eventually to web applications like search and social networking. The mobile platform gave us messaging applications and location-based services. The ongoing democratization of ML will likely give us an amazing array of intelligent software and devices powering our world.

A few comments: (1) Specialized chipsets have no near-term impact on the trend towards democratization. Google’s TPU and NVIDIA’s DGX-1 support powerful deep learning applications, but these will continue to be out of reach for most business users. (2) MXNet is a project of the Apache Software Foundation, not Amazon. Amazon has announced (informally) that it plans to use MXNet, but so do many others. Amazon’s own deep learning project, DSSTNE, isn’t going anywhere. (3) Marketplaces will have little or no impact on the enterprise unless the applications sold through this channel are supported by a trusted vendor. (4) The authors omit the most important factor contributing to democratization, the trend towards automation of the data science process itself. “Drag and drop” tools alone are insufficient for all but the simplest projects. Advances in AI enable software developers to reproduce data scientists’s expertise. This is the key innovation that makes it possible for organizations to greatly expand the pool of people who can contribute to machine learning projects. Thomas W. Dinsmore WG79 Peter Kinnon Too much attention is paid to individual machines and the underlying evolutionary mechanisms which have long had “machine learning” under way are usually ignored. In actuality, the real next cognitive entity quietly self assembles in the background, mostly unrecognized for what it is. And, contrary to our usual conceits, is not stoppable or directly within our control. We are very prone to anthropocentric distortions of objective reality. This is perhaps not surprising, for to instead adopt the evidence based viewpoint now afforded by “big science” and “big history” takes us way outside our perceptive comfort zone. The fact is that the evolution of the Internet (and, of course, major components such as Google) is actually an autonomous process. The difficulty in convincing people of this “inconvenient truth” seems to stem partly from our natural anthropocentric mind-sets and also the traditional illusion that in some way we are in control of, and distinct from, nature. Contemplation of the observed realities tend to be relegated to the emotional “too hard” bin. This evolution is not driven by any individual software company or team of researchers, but rather by the sum of many human requirements, whims and desires to which the current technologies react. Among the more significant motivators are such things as commerce, gaming, social interactions, education and sexual titillation. Virtually all interests are catered for and, in toto provide the impetus for the continued evolution of the Internet. Netty is still in her larval stage, but we “workers” scurry round mindlessly engaged in her nurture. By relinquishing our usual parochial approach to this issue in favor of the overall evolutionary “big picture” provided by many fields of science, the emergence of a new predominant cognitive entity (from the Internet, rather than individual machines) is seen to be not only feasible but inevitable. The separate issue of whether it well be malignant, neutral or benign towards we snoutless apes is less certain, and this particular aspect I have explored elsewhere. Stephen Hawking, for instance, is reported to have remarked “Whereas the short-term impact of AI depends on who controls it, the long-term impact depends on whether it can be controlled at all,” This statement reflects the narrow-minded approach that is so common-place among those who make public comment on this issue. In reality, as much as it may offend our human conceits, the march of technology and its latest spearhead, the Internet is, and always has been, an autonomous process over which we have very little real control. Seemingly unrelated disciplines such as geology, biology and “big history” actually have much to tell us about the machinery of nature (of which technology is necessarily a part) and the kind of outcome that is to be expected from the evolution of the Internet. This much broader “systems analysis” approach, freed from the anthropocentric notions usually promoted by the cult of the “Singularity”, provides a more objective vision that is consistent with the pattern of autonomous evolution of technology that is so evident today. Very real evidence indicates the rather imminent implementation of the next, (non-biological) phase of the on-going evolutionary “life” process from what we at present call the Internet. It is effectively evolving by a process of self-assembly. The “Internet of Things” is proceeding apace and pervading all aspects of our lives. We are increasingly, in a sense, “enslaved” by our PCs, mobile phones, their apps and many other trappings of the increasingly cloudy net. We are already largely dependent upon it for our commerce and industry and there is no turning back. What we perceive as a tool is well on its way to becoming an agent. There are at present an estimated 2 Billion Internet users. There are an estimated 10 to 80 Billion neurons in the human brain. On this basis for approximation the Internet is even now only one order of magnitude below the human brain and its growth is exponential. That is a simplification, of course. For example: Not all users have their own computer. So perhaps we could reduce that, say, tenfold. The number of switching units, transistors, if you wish, contained by all the computers connecting to the Internet and which are more analogous to individual neurons is many orders of magnitude greater than 2 Billion. Then again, this is compensated for to some extent by the fact that neurons do not appear to be binary switching devices but instead can adopt multiple states. Without even crunching the numbers, however, we see that we must take seriously the possibility that even the present Internet may well be comparable to a human brain in processing power. And, of course, the degree of interconnection and cross-linking of networks within networks is also growing rapidly. The emergence of a new and predominant cognitive entity that is a logical consequence of the evolutionary continuum that can be traced back at least as far as the formation of the chemical elements in the first stars. This is the main theme of my latest book “The Intricacy Generator: Pushing Chemistry and Geometry Uphill” which is now available as a 336 page illustrated paperback from Amazon, etc. Netty, as you may have guessed by now, is the name I choose to identify this emergent non-biological cognitive entity Padmanaban S Mr. Kinnon’s hypothesis is very alarming indeed. Assuming that future events [or evolutionary changes in and by Internet] will confirm his hypothesis, the implications are very serious. The broader “systems analysis” approach should also raise key questions like [and seek answers for]: Are we simply going to watch such evolution as silent and powerless spectators, regardless of its impact on humanity and life as such? Why can we not consider positive and pro-active initiatives from now on? How do we identify and support corrective or restrictive initiatives from the society, against harms arising? Consider the recent accidental discovery and implementation of ‘kill switch’ in containing the spread of WannaCry impact. I only hope that enough collective [and corrective] societal initiatives also become part of the same evolutionary process giving enormous powers to the cognitive entity Netty.

The European Commission's decision will come after a seven-year investigation into the world's most popular internet search engine triggered by scores of complaints from both U.S. and European rivals. The EU competition authority accused Google in April 2015 of distorting internet search results to favour its shopping service, harming both rivals and consumers. The Commission and Google declined to comment. The U.S. company has in the past rejected the charges, saying that regulators ignored competition from online retailers Amazon and eBay Inc. Fines for companies found guilty of breaching EU antitrust rules can reach 10 percent of their global turnover, which in Google's case could be about $9 billion of its 2016 turnover. Apart from the fine, the Commission will tell Google to stop its alleged anti-competitive practices but it is not clear what measures it will order the company to adopt to ensure that rivals get equal treatment in internet shopping results. The regulator could set out general principles or specific instructions for Google to follow, said an observer. The Commission's tough line is in sharp contrast with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission which settled its own web search case with the company in 2013 by requiring Google to stop "scraping" reviews and other data from rival websites for its own products. Google made three unsuccessful attempts to settle the case with the previous European Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia in a bid to stave off a possible fine and a finding of wrongdoing. Almunia's successor Margrethe Vestager, however, has shown no willingness to settle with Google. The company has also been charged with using its Android mobile operating system to squeeze out rivals and with blocking competitors in online search advertising related to its "AdSense for Search" platform. The platform allows Google to act as an intermediary for websites such as online retailers, telecoms operators or newspapers. The Commission has warned of massive fines in both cases.

On a technical and legal level, that might be true. But when it comes to the day to day use of smartphones, Android doesn’t stray too far from iOS’ walled garden. Although not completely locked down, users are still locked out of functionality and hardware that may be rightfully theirs. There exists a class of Android users that constantly work to subvert this status quo. Some might see them as revolutionaries. Others look at them like they’re insane. They are the root users, and they are on the verge of becoming an endangered specie. What the fork is root? The term “rooting” traces its roots, pardon the pun, to Android’s Linux legacy. Root is the Linux operating system’s unchanging name for the super user, the administrator, the one and only user that has god-like powers over each and every part of the OS. Whatever security limits frameworks like SELinux impose can be bypassed, modified, or undone by root. (Image courtesy of Wikipedia) That immediately poses a problem for a smartphone platform. For desktop-oriented systems like Linux, Windows, and, yes, even the BSD-based macOS, having an easily accessible super user is no problem. But when you have a device that is almost always connected to the Internet and has a higher chance of falling into the wrong hands than your hulking desktop, it becomes a security risk. Google has bent over backwards to hide something that comes naturally to Linux-based systems: root access. Unsurprisingly, that didn’t sit well with not a small number of Android users who expected Google to deliver a smartphone platform that didn’t suffer from the chokehold that Apple had on iOS. A platform that embraced all, including power users. Valid reasons Admittedly, in the early days of Android, rooting was almost necessary to milk Android for all it’s worth. Android a few years back pales in comparison to the Android you have in your pockets today. Functionality was very limited and so was customization. The rooting and modding community had to come up with all sorts of hacks in order to implement a much needed feature, fix something that broke, sometimes intentionally, in a new release, or simply fine tune the performance of a device. All of those required root access. But as mentioned, Android today is very different and many of the reasons that gave birth to the rooting community have vanished or, at the very least, been mitigated. Workaround and hacks still do exist, but many of them no longer require rooting a device. Users and Android developers still don’t see eye to eye on some things, but it is easier to install some third party app these days than risk voiding warranties by rooting. That’s not to say that there is zero reasons to root a device anymore. There are still things that no app, even with all the permissions, can do. And there are some use cases where rooting is really required. Removing some bloatware, mucking around with other operating systems, running servers like VNC, and more. But the power that comes with being able to do those and more comes at a rather high price, and one that entire Android community has to pay. Security toll Rooting as it exists on Android is practically a security exploit. On a normal UNIX-based system like Linux and BSD, getting root access is as easy as logging into the user (named root) and entering the root password. In contrast, Android implements restrictions on multiple levels of the operating system so as to block root access. And the only way to get around that is to technically hack into Android’s security. This is one area where Android is not so different from a proprietary OS like iOS, though on that side of the fence they call it “jailbreaking” instead. In a nutshell, rooting involves finding system vulnerabilities that will allow an arbitrary and unauthorized piece of code to run. This piece of code will usually then tweak system settings, like mounting partitions with read/write access, to install other pieces of program that, in turn, enable root access. If that process sounds almost like the same path a malware would take, then you’re right on track. That is pretty much the reason why rooting is a double-edged sword and why it is getting harder and harder to root Android every new release. The Backdoor argument The spat between Apple and the US government gave rise to the metaphor of the backdoor in terms of encryption, but that also applies to security exploits in general. Including, unfortunately, rooting. Getting root access is a process that exploits a security vulnerability to run arbitrary code, and that vulnerability exists for all Android systems, not just on an individual device. To put it simply, the backdoor exists for everyone, not just rooters. And not everyone trying to gain root access have benign intentions in mind. In fact, the very same tools that makes it easier to root devices with a single tap or install is also being misused and abused by less conscientious people to root users’ devices without their knowledge, much less their permission. Android is often chided for its poor security system, something that is exacerbated by the real possibility that some piece of malware that got past Google’s automated bouncer might actually root a device. While Google may undoubtedly love to cater to Android power users, who arguably have very creative ideas about the platform, it has an even bigger responsibility to secure the operating systems for its billions of users, not to mention is partners and shareholders. And so each Android release is like a game of cat and mouse between the Google security team and the Android rooting community, with Google plugging up holes and rooters looking for new ones to exploit. Of course, this is a rather simplistic representation, as rooting developers are often more security-minded than your average user and do report such vulnerabilities back to Google. But, as it stands, it’s not a pretty picture, and it’s about to get uglier. Netflix et al. If there are valid reasons to root devices, Google might giving equally strong reasons not to root devices. And it’s not some abstract concept like security but a practical one called “Netflix”. Not too long ago, it was discovered that Netflix gained the ability to hide itself from rooted devices or even just those that had unlocked bootloaders, which doesn’t necessarily entail rooting. Apparently, it wasn’t just a Netflix thing. Netflix was just using a new developer option that allowed app developers to discriminate against rooted devices. These new SafetyNet exclusion rules have multiple angles, including vendor lock-in and monopoly. And they really only affect what users will be able to see on Google Play Store, not the functionality of the apps themselves. But it is also an indication of the steps that Google is making to make having a rooted device less attractive or even less useful. And it is getting app developers to take its side. Of course, there will be a tug of war between Google and the Android rooting and modding community, but if enough of the big apps do things Google’s way, the rooting community might see its numbers dwindle even further. Never underestimate the power of Netflix. Wrap-up: The real debate Rooting is never going away. Android isn’t the perfect OS (yet), OEMs and carriers still burden consumers with bloatware, and there will always be users who want total control of a device they bought with their hard-earned money. But the way Android is implemented today, rooting isn’t also going to change. It will always be a security liability. But at the heart of the matter isn’t whether rooting is still worth that risk or not. The real question is whether Google should have deprived users of something that is inherent in the Linux operating system in the first place. In an ideal world, users can have their cake and eat it too. They can have a hardened mobile platform that still offers unfettered access to anything and everything. Unfortunately, such an open mobile operating system doesn’t exist yet, and even secure Linux desktops have users who shoot themselves in the foot with root access. Until such an OS exists, we’ll have to continue the imperfect and delicate dance between power and security.

Why on June 2? Today would have been Baker’s 66th birthday. Writes Google: Teaching himself to sew, Baker put his skills to work for the San Francisco gay community, making banners for marches and protests. In 1978 Baker used those skills to create a new symbol for the LGBT Community to replace the pink triangle, a symbol of oppression and devastation from the Nazi’s classification of LGBT people in World War II. Baker’s Rainbow was a more positive and celebratory symbol. “We needed something beautiful, something from us,” Baker explained. “The rainbow is so perfect because it really fits our diversity in terms of race, gender, ages, all of those things. Plus, it’s a natural flag—it’s from the sky!” Making the flag was no small task. Baker gathered thirty people in the attic of the Gay Community Center in San Francisco to hand-dye and sew together over 1000 yards of cotton. The modern day rainbow flag features six colors, but the original used eight, each representing a different aspect of the community. The iconic symbol stuck and soon Baker was flooded with requests for more flags. Baker’s sister, Ardonna Cook, also reflects on his life and legacy by sharing, “Our family is so proud of the legacy of activism and artistry that Gilbert has left to the world. He touched millions across the globe and empowered them to become stronger and more visible LGBT people. Gilbert led a bold and inspiring life by bringing The Rainbow Flag to life and it is that legacy which should guide us in respecting and celebrating diversity.” Read more about the doodle HERE.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Reviews Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Google Chrome will soon come with a built in ad blocker -4 by Michael Allison  @al_ikw Jun 2, 2017 at 11:20 GMT3 days ago Google may be one of the world’s largest ad companies, but the firm is just as much against awful ads like the rest of us. From next year, Google’s Chrome Browser will come with a built-in ad blocker to help beat back the scourge of poorly done exploitative ads. It may seem counter-intuitive for Google to block ads in Chrome, but it makes sense. Google’s whole business model revolves around selling ads, which fund much of the free services and websites on the internet. Now, while less scrupulous bodies have taken advantage of this by providing intrusive ads, malicious pop-ups and the like, this results in people blocking ads wholesale. In this scenario, both sites and corporations With that in mind, it’s only natural that Google would work to get the troublesome ads blocked. This won’t be an ad blocker per se, the Wall Street Journal describes this as an ad filter. This means that it’ll serve more like Adblock Plus’ settings for acceptable ads, only filtering out ads which are judged to be unacceptable.  While there will likely be some faux concern from some who argue that Google’s Adblock would be unethical due to Google inevitably favouring their own ads anyway, that would be uninformed. Google also isn’t the one who is determining which ads are unacceptable, it’ll be the Coalition for Better Ads, an organisation formed of bodies including Thomson Reuters, the Washington Post and Facebook who sets the standards, and they’ll be working with publishers to determine which ads are acceptable and which are not. Chrome being a voluntary, user initiated install and not a compulsory app should also cripple any accusations of monopoly abuse by competitors. While Microsft’s Edge doesn’t have a built-in adblocker, users can still rely on the Adblock extension for the same experience. For everyone else, Google wants to have them covered.

Cade Metz Business Date of Publication: 06.02.17. 06.02.17 Time of Publication: 7:00 am. 7:00 am Google Is Already Late to China’s AI Revolution Google chairman Eric Schmidt in Wuzhen. Noah Sheldon for WIRED Sitting on a stage in Wuzhen, China, a historic city up the river from Shanghai, Google chairman Eric Schmidt described what he called “the age of intelligence.” But he wasn’t talking about human intelligence. He meant machine intelligence. He trumpeted the rise of deep neural networks and other techniques that allow machines to learn tasks largely on their own, either by finding patterns in vast amounts of data or through their own trial and error. At Google, using a sweeping software tool called TensorFlow, engineers have built deep learning systems that can identify faces and objects in photos, recognize commands spoken into smartphones, and translate one language into another. Schmidt called this the biggest technological change of his lifetime. Then he mentioned China’s three largest internet companies: Baidu, Tencent, and Alibaba. All three, he said, could benefit from TensorFlow, which Google open sourced about 18 months ago, sharing it with the world at large. “All of them would be better off if they used TensorFlow,” Schmidt said of the Chinese internet giants. He said the software could predict what people want to purchase, help target ads, and even decide who should a get line of credit. “They can use TensorFlow to study the patterns of their business. They can use this technology to serve their customers faster.” Delivered amidst the week-long Go match between Chinese grandmaster Ke Jie and AlphaGo, a seminal machine created by Google’s DeepMind artificial intelligence lab, Schmidt’s words were not hyperbole. Deep learning and related technologies are fundamentally changing the way Google works, and they will change so many other companies—even entire industries—over the next several years. The trouble is that Schmidt undersells how far these technologies have already spread beyond the walls of Google. The age of intelligence has moved ahead much farther than he admits—especially in China. Schmidt’s words accurately described the enormous power of modern neural networks. And they showed the enormity of Google’s progress and ambition in this area. But if you read between the lines, they also showed the limits of the company’s ambitions—namely: China. Though many in the West paint the deep learning revolution as a phenomenon driven by the big US internet companies, China is hardly far behind. Noah Sheldon for WIRED AI—Not Just American Chinese companies like Baidu, Tencent, and Alibaba are already using these same technologies, as are US giants like Facebook, Microsoft, and Amazon. Google took an early lead, mainly because it bought up so much of the key talent. But many others have embraced deep learning in big ways, including the largest internet companies in China. “It’s easy to fall into the old stereotype—the copy-to-China stereotype, that China is so far behind and they’re just importing everything—but that’s out of date,” says Adam Coates, the American-born AI researcher who now oversees Baidu’s Silicon Valley AI lab. More AlphaGo Cade Metz AlphaGo’s Designers Explore New AI After Winning Big in China Cade Metz Google’s AlphaGo Trounces Humans—But It Also Gives Them a Boost Cade Metz Google Unleashes AlphaGo in China—But Good Luck Watching It There As far back as 2014, Baidu started an internal research lab it called The Institute of Deep Learning, showing its own extreme ambitions. Now it runs several other labs, including the 200-person outpost in Silicon Valley. All told, the company employs more than 1,800 researchers and engineers who work on AI, including driverless cars and other robotics as well as many online services. Deep learning technology is already driving everything from the Baidu search engine to the company’s image and speech recognition services. More than 18 months ago, the Chinese giant publicly revealed it was using neural networks to help target online ads—one of the particular tasks Schmidt said TensorFlow could help them with. Tencent recently opened a stateside AI lab of its own. And like Alibaba and Baidu, it’s now a regular part of the international AI conference circuit that plays such an important role in the progress of AI research in academia and across the industry. (Beijing hosted the International Conference on Machine Learning in 2015.) Meanwhile, these technologies are spreading beyond the big players and across the rest of the China. A San Francisco deep learning startup called Skymind recently created a subsidiary in mainland China to serve this burgeoning market. “China is latching on to everything it can,” says Skymind founder Adam Gibson, who is now based in Asia, referring to deep learning technologies. Opportunities and Costs Clearly, Google sees the opportunities available across this enormous market—just as it sees opportunities for its AI technologies in so many other parts of the world. That’s why Schmidt was in China last week alongside several of the key players in the company’s push toward machine learning. These included Jeff Dean, the head of the Google Brain AI lab, and Jia Li, who helps oversees artificial intelligence across the company’s increasingly important cloud computing services. Google withdrew its online services from China more than seven years ago, unhappy with government censorship laws and apparent state-sponsored hacking operations. But now it wants back in, and it sees AI as the available path. The Go match—a reprise of the historic match AlphaGo played in Korea last year—was an ideal starting point. But although Google has taken a worldwide lead in machine learning, it’s clearly a long way from really applying this expertise in China. Google’s online services are still blocked in the country, and though the company collaborated with local authorities in organizing the event in Wuzhen last week, this collaboration has its limits. Two days before the event, state TV pulled out, and half-an-hour into the first Go game, all online broadcasts went dark. Media outlets covered the event with news stories but they avoided the name Google, apparently under instructions from the government. The event still took place, but it seemed to betray Google’s inability to win hearts and minds in the country. Even Americans were struck by the way Schmidt talked down to Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent, when he should have done the opposite. “Some of the major Chinese companies are some of the most sophisticated deep learning and data companies in the world,” says Skymind founder and CEO Chris Nicholson. “Google has misread China in the past, and I think that Eric Schmidt’s speech is evidence it will continue to misread China and lose out on one of the biggest markets on earth.” Schmidt may have pushed TensorFlow for a reason. It’s the sole means of using its new TPU chip, a processor specifically designed for running deep neural networks that will soon be available via Google’s cloud computing services. In many ways, Google sees cloud computing, where it rents raw computing resources to businesses and coders over the internet, as the future of the company. That future would be much, much bigger if can get Chinese businesses on its cloud. But that reality is a long way off—at best. Like the company’s other online services, the Google cloud isn’t available in China. And despite what Schmidt implied, Chinese companies like Baidu and Tencent are already starting to offer machine learning tools atop its own cloud computing services. It is indeed the age of intelligence—but the whole world already knows it.

Over the past few years, ad blockers have risen in use, though that's leveled out to 22% of web users this year. Reports suggested Google was planning to offer a blocker or ad filter in Chrome by default, similar to Opera, and that now looks set to happen next year. Chrome already blocks pop-ups, which are frequently used for advertising.  Sridhar Ramaswamy, senior vice president of ads and commerce at Google, said in a blog post that most online content is funded by advertising. "But the reality is, it’s far too common that people encounter annoying, intrusive ads on the web - like the kind that blare music unexpectedly, or force you to wait ten seconds before you can see the content on the page," he said. "These frustrating experiences can lead some people to block all ads - taking a big toll on the content creators, journalists, web developers and videographers who depend on ads to fund their content creation."  To help, Chrome will start blocking ads that "are not compliant with the Better Ads Standards starting in early 2018," Ramaswamy said, stressing that includes ads that are "owned or served by Google". That's a message Google will be keen for people to hear, as it's one of the largest online advertisers. EU Commissioner Margrethe Vestager tweeted after the move was rumoured earlier this year that she'd be following the plans and its effects "closely". Conveniently, most of Google's ads already comply with that standard, The Guardian reported, in particular its text-based search advertising. The Coalition for Better Ads standard calls for sites on desktop to stop using pop-up ads (already blocked by Chrome), auto-playing video ads with sound, prestitial ads with a countdown, and large "sticky" ads that hover over content. On mobile, it also includes animated ads, ad density above 30%, full-screen scroll-over ads, and large sticky ads, among others.    For those who don't already meet the standard, Google is also offering a tool to help publishers concerned the ads on their sites may fall foul of the new blocking system, letting them get an "Ad Experience Report" to see how the Better Ads Standards would apply to their own advertising. "It provides screenshots and videos of annoying ad experiences we've identified to make it easy to find and fix the issues," said Ramaswamy.  Google is working on another tool that could let publishers offer to let visitors continue using their ad blocker if they pay up. "With Funding Choices, now in beta, publishers can show a customised message to visitors using an ad blocker, inviting them to either enable ads on their site, or pay for a pass that removes all ads on that site through the new Google Contributor," Ramaswamy said.  Seismic impact of ad blockers The UK arm of the Internet Advertising Bureau welcomed the move by Google. "We at the IAB UK warmly welcome any industry change that promotes better digital advertising with a view to making a better consumer experience," a spokesperson said. "Google's move quickly puts weight behind the stance set by the Coalition for Better Ads following the release of their better ads standards." Ben Williams, operations manager at AdBlock Plus, said the move showed the "seismic impact that consumer tools like ad blockers have had on the billion dollar ad industry." He noted AdBlock Plus works across browsers and mobile, letting "users filter as much or as little as they like".    "We also see the need to give users alternative options to directly fund websites and content creators without relying on advertising, which is why we work on Flattr, a zero-click payment system that works across all browsers on any website," he added.

Google's homepage features stop-motion animation of fabric strips coming together in order to form the flag which acts as a symbol of pride for the LGBT community. The sequence was made by Doodler Nate Swinehart and a team of supporters only a few block away from where Baker first created the first rainbow flag in 1978 in San Francisco, Google noted. "Teaching himself to sew, Baker put his skills to work for the San Francisco gay community, making banners for marches and protests," the company shared about his story. "In 1978 Baker used those skills to create a new symbol for the LGBT Community to replace the pink triangle, a symbol of oppression and devastation from the Nazi's classification of LGBT people in World War II. Baker's Rainbow was a more positive and celebratory symbol." "We needed something beautiful, something from us," Baker is quoted as saying. "The rainbow is so perfect because it really fits our diversity in terms of race, gender, ages, all of those things. Plus, it's a natural flag—it's from the sky!" The first rainbow flag is said to have been made by thirty people in the attic of San Fransisco's Gay Community Center using over 1,000 yards of cotton. The original featured eight different colors, however, pink and turquoise were later dropped. Baker died in his sleep at his home in New York City at the age of 65 in March. "Today we celebrate Gilbert Baker's pride, creativity, and the lasting impact he's had on strengthening and uniting people all over the world," Google wrote.

Navigation gHacks Technology News The independent technology news blog Home Header Menu Home Windows Software Firefox Chrome Google Android Email Deals Best of Support Us Return to Content Google Chrome will block some ads in 2018 By Martin Brinkmann on June 2, 2017 in Google Chrome - Last Update:June 2, 2017 30 Google revealed yesterday that the company's Chrome web browser will start blocking some ads on the Internet from 2018 on. Many sites reported that Google will integrate a native ad-blocker in the Google Chrome web browser, but that is only partially true. While we don't have any version of Chrome yet that supports the new tech, judging from Google's description here, things are not as black and white as you'd expect them to be. Fact is, that Google Chrome will block some ads starting in 2018. Google explains that Chrome will support the Better Ads Standard, published by an industry group that wants to improve ads online. In dialogue with the Coalition and other industry groups, we plan to have Chrome stop showing ads (including those owned or served by Google) on websites that are not compliant with the Better Ads Standards starting in early 2018. The Better Ads website highlights the following formats as problematic: Desktop: pop-up ads, auto-playing video ads with sound, prestitial ads with countdown, large sticky ads Mobile: pop-up ads, prestitial ads, pages with ad-density higher than 30%, flashing animated ads, auto-playing video ads with sound, postitial ads with countdown, full-screen scrollover ads, large sticky ads. Google Chrome will block ads on websites that show advertisement that falls into the groups listed above. What this means is that Chrome will block all ads on those websites, not just the ads that are considered problematic by the industry group. Google published a new tool for Webmasters on the official Search Console website that provides you with information on the site's ad experience status. Google plans to list all ad experiences there that "annoy users" so that webmasters know that ads are blocked in Chrome by default. The page separates desktop from mobile, and may not show a reviewed status right away. Google launched a new option for publishers to sustain their online business on top of that. The Funding Choices program allows publishers to customize messages to visitors with adblockers to invite them to disable ad blocking on the site, or support the site through the new Google Contributor system. Google Contributor is a new system which websites and users may join. Users may buy credits, and pick websites out of the list of supported sites which they want to support. Each time a page is viewed on the site in question, some money is transferred to the account of the site operator. Sites may select what they charge per page view. My Take Google, as the world's largest ad company, understands that ad blocking is on the rise, and that one cannot stop the trend with anti-ad-blocking solutions. The company's believes that most Internet users don't have a problem with advertisement in general, but with certain forms of advertisement. I think that is true to a degree. What Google does not address at all are other things about ads that annoy part of the global Internet population. Two that come to my mind right away are tracking and malware ad campaigns. Google is in an ideal position however as it controls much of the ad market and the browser market. If a company with less of a market share would roll out an initiate like this, it would probably bomb because of a lack of reach. I'm pretty certain that Google will be able to reach a sizeable number of Chrome users who use ad blockers, and of course users who don't use ad blockers. It remains to be seen how good of an experience this will result in, and how publishers will fare when it comes to that. Google Contributor on the other hand is something that I don't think has a lot of staying power. Convincing users to join Contributor will be a tough sell but it depends on how the feature is promoted. If users see it on the sites they visit regularly, they may be inclined to give it a try. I think it won't reach that level of sustainability, especially since Google wants its cut of what users pay publishers. Now You: What is your take on the announcement?

Reply Yuliya June 2, 2017 at 1:19 pm # >Google Contributor When this came out it really made me laugh. The worst part about ads, which is tracking, this thing takes it to a whole new level, since it requires you to be logged in and accept third party cookies (I guess). But, Google trying to block popup ads (maybe including those new-ish overlay popups that you reported here a while ago) and high volume autoplaying video ads - there's a website which Google ranks quite up on many results, I don't remember its name, and even if I did I would not want to make them publicity, they have a video ad auto playing on every page, it is so anoying that whatever fix to whatever software issue they provide it's not worth it and I just close the tab and look elsewhere. To make things worse you can't stop it by clicking in the middle, you have to precisely click on a very small play/pause button. If Google will block this cr.p, forcing these site owners to quit using such obnoxious means of serving ads, that would be really appreciated. Reply Mike June 2, 2017 at 1:23 pm # I can't blame them for doing something on the mobile side, the mobile version of Google Chrome is terrible because of all the terrible mobile ads some websites choose to have. Still, I'm not sure this has much effect on me when Brave on Android became my default mobile browser some time ago and uBlock Origin is unbeatable in terms of user options/performance. Reply chesscanoe June 2, 2017 at 1:54 pm # From a user perspective, almost any solution is better than the current lack of default solution. But progress is being made for Edge now, as Microsoft Store now has blessed uBlock Origin. Reply Tom Hawack June 2, 2017 at 2:11 pm # It's not because it's a smart move that it's bad. It's smart because indeed there is no future for anti-ad-blockers, it's not a bad move because better advertisement is a progress. It could be a fake deal for users extrapolating on a company's virtue on the ground of its efforts if perceived as a win-win scenario : the company always holds the best share. It remains, IMO, an ambiguous project when in fact, besides the first aspect of modern Web advertisement which is disturbance and which this move intends to contain, remain tracking and "malvertisement". For all those who enjoy a 100% ad-free Internet it will be as a return and avoided I believe. Here again the problematic of sites sustained by ads verses a user's tranquility. I believe those of us who struggle to eradicate the tiniest ad are a minority, hence won't break much and perhaps even less with Google's move where some of us might consider a compromise. I won't but I count on those who don't feel as bad as myself with ads/intrusion to keep the system rolling. This is a worldwide scheme and advertisement will have to deal with the untouchables (those who refuse each and every ad), and it will accept them more easily if they are lesser tomorrow than today. Now, if the ad business continues it's invasion regardless of reality, if it blocks compromises which include itself (that's where Google's move is welcomed) then it will loose its war. It shouldn't be a war, it wouldn't be if the ad business didn't make it a war, it might no longer be if Google opens the solution, even imperfectly, with a true incidence on the ad business whatever it be. Reply ddk June 2, 2017 at 7:01 pm # Quote: "then it will loose its war". It's "lose" not "loose" Most users don't care if a site is plastered by flashing annoying ads. Ad companies rely on people being constantly distracted, it's a cultural thing. We are raised and trained to be multi taskers and in the process regard constant distractions as normal in society. It's psychological more than anything else. Advertisers take advantage of this knowing they'll get "clicks" regardless of how messy an ad infested site looks. Reply Tom Hawack June 2, 2017 at 7:23 pm # I agree, ddk, and I've even say it's a good thing, the fact that some users are not as concerned by ads as others in that it contributes to sites staying alive. This is why I'd never hold any demagogy against advertisement, not only because those who support it allow those who can't stand it to continue nevertheless to visit their favorite sites, but also because I cannot say I have a position of principle against advertisement, an intellectual opposition so to say : informing others and advocating one's work is perhaps as old as the world. It's more in the way it's done, no limit, more and more... and that, I just can't stand anymore, be it on the Web, on TV ... I'm getting mad watching The French Tennis Tournament on TV (only) interrupted by too many ads. It's physiological, nervous, I'm done with this excessive and often deeply stupid advertisement policy. Include tracking if it doesn't bother them as well but malvertisement is another problem because one's acceptation of ads, when it comes to malvertisement, may have consequences beyond himself, like driving. Tomorrow, less ads, better ads, no tracking and no more malvertisement and I's stop using adblockers. I'd love not having to hate ads as they are now, because irritation is bad for health and because love is always closer to joy than hatred. But I feel force-fed. To "lose" a war, ok: I must have had a "Footloose" in mind! Earl June 4, 2017 at 7:37 pm # As such, most "clicks" probably occur by mistake, some users being quite confused by the plethora of non-content, clickable links and regions on a page. (Confuse the visitor enough and you get the desired result.) Technically speaking, the human brain does not multitask--never has. We are capable of focusing on only one thing at a time. Some, though, are more easily distracted than others. Mixing ads with content was never a good idea and will never actually work to promote any product or service. The current business of advertising is basically just a rip-off of those trying to promote their products and services. Best case, Google's approach won't make things any worse from the standpoint of annoyance. Providing another vector for malware attacks is what really needs to be stopped. Tracking? good luck. 1984 June 2, 2017 at 2:35 pm # Google's approach is a scam: They only block the visible part of the ad but the tracking...remains. In the end, AdSense ads won't be blocked. It would destroy Google's business model. Try Brave instead https://brave.com/ . It's the clean approach. Reply Richard Allen June 2, 2017 at 2:58 pm # My take on the announcement is to try and not yawn until I read that "Chrome will block all ads on those websites, not just the ads that are considered problematic by the industry group". That's harsh, but deserved. Unfortunately that will not be enough to eliminate the security threat delivered by ad networks. Some have been whining that ad-blockers will break the internet but I argue that advertising networks and publishers have already broken it by delivering abusive, intrusive, misleading, and privacy-stealing ads, trackers and... malware. One example is Forbes forcing readers to disable ad-blockers then delivering malware. Or Yahoo distributing malware with their own ad network to their own websites, for days. It's crazy! The best and arguably most important security software on my computers is an ad/content blocker which is why I haven't seen a single malware object on my computers in 9-10 years. Over the last few years I've cleaned about a dozen computers for friends and family members. All of them had two things in common; not using an ad/content blocker, and they all had 300+ malware objects. A couple had around a thousand. I'm serious! I felt bad when the owner of one computer saw me laughing when I saw a scan result. Families with teenagers!

Until ALL three downsides are gone the ads will stay blocked on my computers. Reply Rotten Scoundrel June 2, 2017 at 5:41 pm # I am largely with Tom Hawack, but would also point out that Google is OK-ing sites to demand payment to view, for browsers with ad-blockers. That made me laugh and spit coffee everywhere. The Internet advertising world would clean itself up in days as the millions of ad-blocked browser users found alternative sites that did not charge for a blocker. It is the rampant greed of those sites that want to force all of the passing traffic to see their ads. Check the efficacy of News-Media Paywalls. Most sites have now dropped them. On another note: Even Amazon allows ads that operate contrary to the The Better Ads format policies! I was using a friend's laptop the other day and stunned at the ads on Amazon. Having uBlock and/or AdBlockPlus active on our PCs I have never seen so much crap before. As a Prime customer I do not expect to barraged with ads. Just another great reason for ad-blockers. Reply Anonymous June 2, 2017 at 5:42 pm # This is terrible news. So far most of us have enjoyed an ad free experience, with very few websites employing anti-ad blocking tactics, while the tech illiterate majority was viewing the ads for us. With a native ad blocker in Chrome said majority is going to start blocking ads, which in turn will cause anti-ad blocking to go nuclear with an increasing amount of websites starting to use increasingly sophisticated means of stopping ad blocking software. Reply Albert June 3, 2017 at 5:34 am # This is probably Google's first step of their strategy. Step Two will be to prevent Ad-Blockers from running in Chrome with the justification being that because of their technology ads will have become acceptable.... Reply Rick A. June 3, 2017 at 6:04 am # Use Firefox with uBlock Origin or even Brave Browser. Reply Dave June 3, 2017 at 8:04 am # If you ask me, there's a hidden agenda behind this move by Google - that's their ingenious way of killing their competition in the ad business. Ad-networks already can't compete with Google in the banner ads arena, so their only advantage is displaying ads through pop-ups and videos... Take that from them and you instantly put them out of business! Leaving Google as the only player in the online advertising business. Ingenious! Reply Dave June 3, 2017 at 8:28 am # Oh, and one more thing - Since last year, Google's own Adsense displays interstitials ads (if the publisher chose to enabled it through Adsense' dashboard). So I wonder if Google will count their own interstitials as offending (and block them from showing) or they will only do this to their competitors?! Reply Nebulus June 3, 2017 at 2:19 pm # Actually the move is not unlike the one done by AdBlock Plus extension when they started to allow only the ads that meet some arbitrary standard they invented. Declan June 3, 2017 at 5:18 pm # @Dave.... I totally agree. Google makes it's money from ads, and to think that Google will block ads that it gains income from is naïve. The tracking will remain, especially for those ads that come from DoubleClick, AdSense or other Google run ad-placement groups. I rather imagine that the real purpose here is to block non-Google ads under the guise of "non-compliance" as a way to force others to use the same formats and standards so they can be more easily tracked. After all, this is Google we're talking about, forcing others to use basically a Google standard, within a Google product, aimed at users that provide Google with revenue. Let's not think that this is an altruistic move and it has suddenly returned to it's original "don't be evil" days. Reply Ranger June 3, 2017 at 7:00 pm # Declan ... your second paragraph: Right on target ... Bullseye! Tony June 3, 2017 at 8:41 am # Doesn't Google block all ad-blockers from the Google Play store (AdAway, for example)? To not be hypocrites, does this mean that Google will now be preventing users from downloading Google Chrome from the Google Play store? Reply MazTerGee June 4, 2017 at 9:27 pm # There's nothing wrong with Ads on webpages, it's the source of funds to keep that informative website going. If you don't like Ads just ignore them. I can understand Ads that popup in your face , over the page you're reading being blocked, that would be great, but no standard ads that sit on the side of the of webpage looking flashy, just ignore them.

International Business Times UK UK World Business Politics Fintech Technology Science Sport Entertainment Opinion Video Pictures Log out Newsletter Signup Smartphones Cybersecurity Innovation Social Media Games Motoring Technology Smartphones Using Android? These are the most secure phones according to Google Google published a list of devices that are up to date with its security bulletins. By Agamoni Ghosh June 2, 2017 12:17 BST The Android Nougat OSGetty Images/Jeff Pachoud Google has published a list of 42 smartphone models across 12 vendors that it considers are most secure as they run up-to-date Android OS versions with the latest security patches. As Android is an open source OS, malware, ransomware, phishing and security attacks are common on the platform. Device security has become a major selling point for vendors, which is why Google decided to publish the full list to make buyers aware of secure Android phones. The company says these are the only models that have its latest Google security patches updated and so, the risk of a malicious attack is far lesser on these models than on others. Check out the list below: Manufacturer Device BlackBerry PRIV Fujitsu F-01J General Mobile GM5 Plus d, GM5 Plus, General Mobile 4G Dual, General Mobile 4G Gionee A1 Google Pixel XL, Pixel, Nexus 6P, Nexus 6, Nexus 5X, Nexus 9 LGE LG G6, V20, Stylo 2 V, GPAD 7.0 LTE Motorola Moto Z, Moto Z Droid Oppo CPH1613, CPH1605 Samsung Galaxy S8+, Galaxy S8, Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 Edge, Galaxy S7 Active, Galaxy S6 Active, Galaxy S5 Dual SIM, Galaxy C9 Pro, Galaxy C7, Galaxy J7, Galaxy On7 Pro, Galaxy J2, Galaxy A8, Galaxy Tab S2 9.7 Sharp Android One S1, 507SH Sony Xperia XA1, Xperia X Vivo Vivo 1609, Vivo 1601, Vivo Y55 The company says there are close to 100 other models that have some or the other security update patch issued to them in the last 90 days even though they may not be onboard the Nougat or Marshmallow OS. Cybersecurity experts have, however, warned users to be wary of using older versions of Android as most of them do not have spam and malware filters. Post the WannaCry ransomware attacks, experts say the next wave of attacks could be aimed at Android systems. The platform is not only one of the most vulnerable mobile OS, but is also used by over a billion people around the world.

[Update: Site is live, more details] Google launches Funding Choices, a way for users to pay sites to hide ads Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/06/01 8:01pm PDTJun 1, 2017 54 Plus 1 on G+ 126 Share on Facebook 77 Share on Twitter Total Shares257 Games News Update 1: 2017/06/01 8:01pm PDT The new site for Google Contributor/Funding Choices is live, and offers some new insight into how the service actually works. According to the signup page, each page without ads You may recall Google Contributor, which was a service by Google that allowed users to pay a monthly contribution to see fewer ads online. Your money would directly substitute the money earned by the site for advertisements. Contributor was discontinued in late 2016, with Google saying that an improved version would become available in "early 2017." Today, the company launched Funding Choices, the successor to Contributor. Currently in beta, it allows sites to show a customized message to visitors using an ad blocker. The message asks users to either enable ads for the site, or pay for a pass through Contributor that removes all ads on that site. Unlike the original Contributor, Funding Choices hides more than just AdSense ads If you're reading this and thinking, "I really wish Android Police would do this," then you're in luck. We've been part of Google's internal beta, but we're not quite ready to roll it out. Just know that we are definitely working on it. The new Contributor site doesn't seem to be live yet, but there will likely be more details there soon. Source: Google Update 1: 2017/06/01 8:01pm PDT The new site for Google Contributor/Funding Choices is live, and offers some new insight into how the service actually works. According to the signup page, each page without ads that you view on a site costs a small amount, with publishers apparently able to change the price (most of them seem to use $0.01 per page right now). So assuming $0.01 per page, $1 gets you 100 pages without ads, and Google is offering a $5 pass to start out with. Not bad pricing at all, as long as sites stay around the $0.01 price point. Google also offers a list of sites supporting Google Contributor, which currently includes Beliefnet, Business Insider UK, ComicBook, Eurogamer, Grub Street, Hot Air, Parkers, Patheos, Popular Mechanics, Townhall, Twitchy, and World Wide Gaming.

NexusPhan The ads in AP are not bad. Very reasonable and not intrusive at all. I have this site whitelisted to help support their great work. You should consider it too before funding choices goes live. MJ There is certainly websites with much more obnoxious ads but their is a lot of ads on AP. It's just not an acceptable user experience and I not going to subject myself to it. I have been calling for a way to donate to AP for awhile now (why did AP have to wait for a Google solution?) so we see how this plays out. Zachary Dunn Ecommerce is hard. Most small outlets like AP prefer a platform that can handle the security and financial liability. MJ I am not talking about ecommerce but making donations. LOL Alex Dueppen Unfortunately Disqus hasn't been the same way, it seems to often load ads that redirect you to those scam "You are winner" pages that try to look like facebook. Adriannacsmith Google is paying 97$ per hour! Work for few hours & have longer with friends and family! !dy164c: On tuesday I got a great new Land Rover Range Rover from having earned $8752 this last four weeks.. Its the most-financialy rewarding I've had.. Follow this link for more information !dy164c: ➽➽ ➽➽;➽➽ http://GoogleFinancialCashJobs454MarketDriveGetPaid$97/Hour... ★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫::::::!dy164c:....,..... Maxr1998 I hope these cancerous, unblockable Outbrain ads will also be a part of the funding choices, then I'll happily pay - not that I wouldn't contribute anyway, because I feel a bit guilty for blocking ads for a long time already.. Eli Stevens I do the job from comfort and ease of my residence, participating in effortless activities that just require from you a Laptop together with internet access and I am just pleased than ever... After 6 months in this job and therefore managed to get remunerated in whole 36,000 usd... Mainly I get approximately 80 bucks/h and work for 3 to 4 hours constantly.And magnificent factor with this job is the fact that you can supervise time when you do the job and for just how long as you wish for and you attain a check week by week.>>>> learn by clicking here how to do it right now needa I use adguard. No outbrain. Just an empty spot above the comments section with sponsored content in one corner and recommended by Outbrain in another. Maxr1998 Hm, interesting. I'm using adaway, maybe I need to tweak my filter lists a little then.. NeverrKnowsBest I have gotten full screen malware ads from AP before. I did not want to block them, but they forced my hand. NexusPhan They did have a bad streak of ads for a while about a year ago. I remember that now that you say it. I enabled ad blocker for a few months after it happened. Corbin Davenport I will say that those are normally from Disqus, and we've worked with Disqus in the past to identify them and get them removed. ZettabyteGamer I'm sure it would be hard but if disqus is causing so many problems, maybe you should switch to a different comment section or make your own? needa They would just have to throw more ads up themselves to pay for it. Disqus is pretty good anyways. Not to mention Disqus is a way to get new people to come back to your site. Meaning some guy that already has a disqus acct, but found the site because he needs a new phone, can instantly comment without having to sign up for another account at another site. needa I never thought about Disqus throwing in ads. Sort of makes me feel like an idiot for not seeing what is right in front of me. Now it all makes sense. Thanks. Marcelove Would you work to remove the Outbrain and Taboola cancer networks too? Keep any of those at AP makes any other changes useless... tnt How can you tell what is from Disqus vs the site? Justin W I'd agree that AP's ads aren't bad, but Disqus's are terrible. Irwin LOL are you seriuos? on mobile, like half the site is all ads. It's ridiculous. blueman24 I'm ok with whitelist for sites like AP on desktop but on mobile, I don't want any ads. AP can add 5 more ads on their desktop site but don't cripple performance on my already slow phone. Marcelove Never while it still use Taboola or Outbrain as ads delivers... Both are cancers and any site promoting them shall stay adblocked... No matter how much I like a site, or as good it is, if it decides to use those networks... Doing that equals being automatically added and never removed from my blacklist and everyone should do that to enforce it is unacceptable... tnt I'm with you 100%. They're pure trash. Add Revcontent in there as well. wow Why are they "cancers"? I mean, from what I see outbrain ads are trashy and slow but I don't understand why that's an automatic blacklist for a site that provides quality content for free. Do they have malware or something? (This is referring to those fake news ads above the comment section, right?) EcE APK Mirror - - I do not feel guilty and will happily wait my 10 seconds rather than see 200 ads per page and pop ups (or whatever they are called which are basically the same) whenever I need an APK. Rashad Would it be a one time cost or is this a cost each time we visit a participating site? Corbin Davenport I believe it's a monthly subscription, just like the previous Contributor. MJ Questions? Why did AP have to wait for a Google solution? There are many ways you could have been collecting money all this time. A automatic monthly subscription? Sounds like a loser already as people hate that. It's not going to be a set amount but like pick an amount right? An annual subscription would make more sense. Why can't there just be a simple donate button so people could send money when they can and just continuing blocking the ads ourselves like we have been already doing? Cai Copley It's that you do it in one, centralized location for such a subscription, and not doing it over a series of sites and forgetting how much you're spending. MJ I guess need more details on how it works... Jeff Beck We'll have a special rate for you MJ. .005 cents per article, $15 per grumpy comment submitted. We are going to make a fortune off you ;) Maxr1998 Starting the day with a smile thanks to your witty comments. Thanks Jeff! :D George https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4ba5750c423a92daff44db461bb3042c433e0f5e7edc1f8dadcb32198db0d5e8.jpg Artem Russakovskii It's almost here. Just finishing final testing. Mark Curtis Or just block ads and not pay! I'm entitled to free content! gimme gimme gimme. faceless128 it's about safety. there are so many malicious advertisements out there. if a site doesn't directly control the ads that show up, how can they ensure our safety? Camerooni I use privacy badger.. if it blocks ads that play bad - I'm okay with that alongside blocking tracking cookies etc. What I don't like is sites assuming that if you're blocking an ad network that plays bad with you that you're the bad guy.. Things have to work both ways. Mark Curtis AdBlocking started way back when they were simple JPGs with no JavaScript at all. It could even go back to that and people would complain about having to download the bytes. Ailín Ó’S I wonder will this work internationally or just USA only because I use adblock and don't have AP (for example) whitelisted because of the sheer volume of ads on the site especially from the likes of Disqus with their "Congrats! You're a winner!" and "Local man makes 999.999€ a day with this trick!" spam. cadtek91 I'd imagine it would work with anyone with a Google account? Fabrice Thomas Seems like it's only available in these contries: US, Germany, New Zealand and UK https://support.google.com/contributor/answer/6182581?hl=en Jeff Beck If you want to just pay me directly I'll give you my PayPal address. That'll make things even easier on you. I know, I'm way too nice to you all, you're welcome. DavidW dogecoins or gtfo TechGuy22 Thanks but I'll stick adblock and adaway needa If you guys are wanting input, which I know you didn't ask for, five bucks a year would be my max. Not sure how it works, but I would want that on my mobile device. Desktop chrome has what I need in an extension. Ultimately that would earn more money from me, as i get on this sight far less with mobile chrome. Good_Ole_Pinocchio 5 bucks a year? What does that Pay for? Beer for the staff? needa If everyone that comes to this site with adblock paid five bucks, I doubt they would complain. Jeffrey Spiers Brave browser has this built into the browser directly, have used the feature on some of my most frequented sites. Switched to Brave due to many sites detecting and bitching about ad blockers recently. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Web Ads are trash, always. But I've never used ad blockers. Because if I'm taking the content, I'm taking the ads, or I just don't go to the site if the ads are really horrible. I'd more than pay for no ads. psy spy You have to sign in to your gmail account for this to work? Easier to track us. _jack_ It would be nicer to have this from another company, yes. I also wonder, how much Google keeps for themselves? Godspoken Would there even be a difference between you being signed in to your Google account with this vs without? You're using Android and Google services, I don't know what you'd expect. abc I don't browse from my phone so I'm rarely signed into Google, and this will blow some people's minds on this site - but some of us only use two or three Google apps/services, not the whole damn suite. Lord Argyris The official blurb is a little vague. Each time I visit a page without ads, my pass/account/whatever has the site's chosen cost deducted from it. What constitutes a "page"? If I refresh the tab, does that count as an additional page load? What if I visit an article again at a later date? What about those obnoxious sites that have an automatic reload timer? Could they game FC users? I'm sure all these questions will be answered in time. What I would have liked to have seen is some sort of a multiple tier system, whereby I can select specific participants (e.g AP) and offer to pay a flat monthly rate rather than a per-page fee, then leave the normal fee structure in place for others. It would be an easy way to donate more than I would ordinarily accumulate to places I come frequently, without forcing said sites to set up their own donation system. No matter what tier FC visitors choose, the site gets money. FelschR It's stated quite clearly: "Note: you are charged each time you visit or refresh a page, even if you have previously visited it." https://support.google.com/contributor/answer/7359560?hl=en&ref_topic=6182570 Lord Argyris Okay, that answers that. The blurb on the page linked in the article lacked that more detailed information. Matías Duarte I've only used AdBlock for AP the moment that those ads magically opened a new popup while scrolling without even touching them. Now that the annoying problem is gone, I've disabled it. I know no one cares about this but I finally got accepted for a job and I'll get my very first payment tomorrow, so I would happily pay a contribution for this page! Jeff Beck I'll be one to care. Congrats! Getting paid is awesome. At least that's what the other writers at AP tell me. Kostas 💪🎩 😂😂😂😂😂😂 imneveral0ne I just had a you're a winner one pop up on my phone with android police, so it's definitely not gone. ZettabyteGamer How long till I can use this with you guys? I'm itching to try it out, but this is the only site I really read everyday. Necdet Ali Özdür I think the real question here is what Google means by "fewer ads". Are all kinds of ads will be blocked or just intrusive ones? Will the trackers also be removed? someone755 Hmmm... https://youtu.be/4ezd24krgiQ Powsniffer0110 I'd be happy to pay 1¢ an article on AP and Phandroid, XDA ect.! Powsniffer0110 This is funny as hell lol. We're now paying Google to NOT give us ads... Haha. YaKillaCJ Or continue using AdAway, uBlock Origins and DNS Host Blocking via my router. Many can say what they want but my stance is simple. I won't pay just to "not be inconvenienced and intrused on". Any dev, content providers or ect can easily find many non intrusive ways to advertise. Just_No_Stop This whole situation could have been avoided if ads weren't so intrusive, ugly, malicious, irrelevant and numerous. Some pages use less than a tenth of the data with ads blocked, which is crazy, and any ad that slows the delivery of content is unacceptable. It still baffles me how such appalling ads can be effective, if they piss you off why would you then want the product? Paying not to have to put up with such things is not on, I will keep blocking until sites have better ad policies. dancedar1 'Google offering a $5 pass' reads as though they are giving you $5 credit to try it out - they're not; it's £/$5 minimum mattcoz I also read it that way. 4Ui812 1 cent per page isn't a sustainable business model once users realize how much money they'll blow through. Sites that depend on advertising would be better served by using some sort of royalties model like the way radio stations do with music and artists/labels. Otherwise ad blockers are here to stay.Of course Google will want they're cut. 4Ui812 I'd be willing to turn off my ad blocker and sign up Google Contributor/Funding Choices for the free $5 and then I'd blow it all on this site so you guys and gals can have the money. Once it's gone though my ad blocker will be turned back on :-) Ad blocker is used for security reasons. tmartin Will it remove that Outbrain chum? I really need that stuff to go away. needa I use adguard and there is not one single avertisement on this page. There is a spot for outbrain, but no ads. tmartin I use Ghostery mostly because of the chum and that takes care of it, but I wouldn't mind supporting AP. needa I wouldn't mind either. I turn my blocker off periodically to help out. From the looks of it Google will have the answers we need soon enough with their new chrome filter that they are working on. Hopefully then we will be able to support our favorite sites without being slowed down by the ads. Marcelove Wall Street Journal will use it or it will keep that aggressive paywall? Because allowing only 10 articles is like grabbing the print version, take only one sheet and give to someone saying "If you wanna read more than 1 sheet per month, you need to pay us". I'm not against a publisher using a paywall, but the restriction here is so absurd that even if I was 100% determined to subscribe, I wouldn't only because at this example the newspaper is being douchebag... 30 articles, or 1 per day, would really mean that it was caring about itself and the public... But only 10 shows that it don't give a f*ck about the public and is only caring about itself... Anthony Castanza This is a substantial regression from the old version. Morten Ulv How did the old one work? rap 1¢ per page would add up very fast. By the time I read a couple of favorite blogs each day that would be $20 per month. jdrch $0.01 per page sounds doable.

The Mumbai Metro One Pvt Ltd (MMOPL) has collaborated with Google Maps to give the people its authentic timetable and associated geographic details on all the Metro stations on the Versova-Andheri-Ghatkopar route. Through the Google Maps app, the trip timings are provided on each service operated at a frequency of four minutes during peak and eight minutes in non-peak hours. The trip timings, which correspond to services provided on weekdays and on Sundays, can help commuters plan their journeys to reach their destinations faster. "We diligently explore all the possible ways of making the journey of the commuters seamless and convenient, and the tie-up with Google Maps adds another step to digitise Mumbai Metro One," the spokesperson explained. On Google Maps app, the user can tap the Metro Services Option which opens a departure board displaying the schedules of the next few Metro services from that station in both directions. The app will also showcase facilities like stairs, escalators, elevators, ticket counters, in all the three levels of the station including road, concourse and platforms to help all commuters, regulars and new on the entire network. Maharashtra's first Metro, the MMOPL is 11.4 km long providing a crucial east-west suburban connectivity, with 12 stations, reducing the commute between Versova-Ghatkopar from 90 minutes to barely 21 minutes now.
