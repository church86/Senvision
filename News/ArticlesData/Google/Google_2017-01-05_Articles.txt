Google Hangouts API gets hung out to dry Posted Jan 6, 2017 by Josh Constine (@joshconstine) 0 SHARES Next Story A view from Andreessen Horowitz on the questions shaping the future of autonomous vehicles Draw with your face? Conference call ping pong? Not any more. Google today quietly revealed that it will shut down the Hangouts API, preventing new apps from being built and shutting off existing apps on April 25th. There was no blog post about this, just an updated FAQ and email notification to developers active on the API, forwarded to us by one of these devs. Some examples of experiences that could be built on the API include augmented reality selfie masks, polling and collaborative drawing, like the Scoot & Doodle app. But as Google pushes Duo as its consumer video chat app and relegates Hangouts to the enterprise, it’s dropping the flexibility to build these kinds of experiences. The email explains that: “In order to streamline our efforts further, we will be retiring the Google+ Hangouts API that enables developers to build apps for the older version of Hangouts video calls. This API was originally intended to support social scenarios for consumer users as part of Google+, whereas Hangouts is now turning to focus on enterprise use cases. We understand this will impact developers who have invested in our platform. We have carefully considered this change and believe that it allows us to give our users a more targeted Hangouts desktop video experience going forward.” According to the FAQ, the few exceptions that will still run are the ability to dial into a Hangout via DialPad and RingCentral, integrations with enterprise chat tools like Slack and Hangouts on Air tools like Toolbox, Control Room and Cameraman. [Correction: Toolbox was made by an independent developer, not Google.] The Google Hangouts API is a casualty of Google’s fragmented messaging app strategy and the neglect of Hangouts itself. It was one of the first full-featured video chat apps, and it pioneered the AR selfie mask space that Snapchat has now turned into a teenage phenomenon. But by launching multiple siloed messaging apps that don’t talk to each other and forcing the Google+ social layer onto Hangouts, the service fell out of favor. Now with the API shut down, it’s one-step closer to being just a video version of the traditional business call. That might be more “streamline,” but it’s far from inspiring users to take a second look at Hangouts. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Hangouts Description Hangouts bring your conversations to life with photos, emoji, and even group video calls for free.

Since then, Huawei has issued a few software updates and yesterday revealed that the Mate 9 was making its US debut starting Friday, January 6. It will be available for only $599.99. CES 2017 The best mobile tech, PCs and laptops on display Panasonic unveils 'human-like' companion robot Kingston unveils 'world's highest capacity USB flash drive' Voice is the next computer interface Dell's killer new XPS 13 2-in-1 HP shows new business convertible and Sprout Pro Amazon revs Alexa everywhere strategy Under Armour highlights digital transformation efforts See also: CNET's full coverage The Mate 9 brings together the big screen and battery of the Mate 8 and the awesome dual-lens Leica camera from the P9 to create the absolute best of Huawei in a single device. These hardware features are then powered by the latest Android 7.0 Nougat and EMUI 5.0 so that this single device has everything an enterprise user could want in a single Android smartphone. The Huawei Mate 9 will be sold as a GSM SIM-unlocked phone in the US at Newegg, Amazon, B&H, and Best Buy. CNET Review: Miss your Note 7? This is the big-screened phone to buy A billboard at CES also showed that an Amazon Alexa-powered version of the Mate 9 will be launching in 2017. We don't yet have any details on the Alexa integration, but it could be an interesting move for both Huawei (to reach more US customers) and Amazon (to sell more through an established smartphone brand). Specifications Processor: Huawei Kirin 960 2.4 GHz octa-core Display: 5.9 inch 1920x1080 pixels resolution LCD (373 ppi) Operating system: Android 7.0 Nougat with EMUI 5.0 RAM: 4GB Storage: 64GB internal with microSD expansion card slot. (Dual SIM through use of the microSD slot) Cameras: Rear dual 20 megapixel f/2.2 aperture cameras with OIS, one color and one monochrome. Front 8 megapixel f/1.9 aperture Battery: 4000 mAh with SuperCharge fast and safe charging technology Wireless connectivity: 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac WiFi, Bluetooth 4.2 with BLE, NFC Sensors: Fingerprint, G-Sensor, Gyroscope, Compass, Ambient Light, Proximity, Barometer, IR MHA-L29 bands: LTE bands 1/2/3/4/5/7/8/9/12/17/18/19/20/26/28/29 and 3G bands 1/2/4/5/6/8/19 Dimensions: 156.9 x 78.9 x 7.9 mm and 190 grams The Mate 9 doesn't have a 2K display, but it still looks fantastic and the EMUI 5.0 software provides you with the ability to scale the display density to your preferred level. The Huawei Mate 9 will be available in space gray and moonlight silver. Hardware Top ZDNET Reviews Dell Latitude 11 5000 7.9 Apple iPhone 7 Plus 9.3 Amazon Echo 9.0 Google Pixel XL Phone 8.0 Huawei builds gorgeous hardware with dual beveled edges, brushed aluminum shells, 2.5D front glass, minimal bezels, super fast rear fingerprint scanners, and clear displays. The Mate 9 continues the tradition of design excellence and the fit and finish is stunning. While the 1080p display is not the highest resolution available today, it works well for me in interacting with the device, watching videos, and capturing images. 5.9 inches is a great size for getting work done and spreadsheets look great on the Mate 9 when combined with a Bluetooth keyboard for working on the go. The Kirin 960 chipset and EMUI 5.0 help the Mate 9 fly and I have yet to see a single slowdown or performance lag. Even with early software over the past couple of months, the device has been stellar and reliable. It has been a pleasure using devices that I can charge up in the morning and use to my heart's content all day long for 12 or more hours without even glancing for a power cord. I experience this with the iPhone 7 Plus, Google Pixel XL, and also with the Huawei Mate 9. I take my phone off the charger at 4:45 am and can go until 10:00 pm with these three devices. When you connect a USB Type-C cable to the Mate 9, you can also choose the reverse charge option to use the massive battery in the Mate 9 to charge up other devices. This is a handy feature to charge up headphones or other accessories. Huawei Mate 9 first impressions: in pict... SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 20 NEXT PREV One thing that doesn't often get mentioned is RF signal strength and with the Huawei Mate 9 I am seeing connectivity in areas where my iPhone 7 Plus struggles to even make a call. The Mate 9 has been the best performer I have seen since the Galaxy Note 7, thanks to the inclusion of five 2G bands, 10 3G bands and 20 4G bands. Even though it was likely not a battery failure that caused the problems with the Note 7, Huawei has 5-gate protection on the Mate 9 so you can rest assured you will experience a safe charging experience with the device. To experience the fastest charging on the Mate 9, you need to use the proprietary SuperCharge adapter. Huawei states you can get a full day's usage out of just a 20 minute charge. The Huawei Mate 9 upgrades the Leica dual-lens experience with integration of optical image stabilization (OIS) in both cameras. The color and monochrome cameras work together to help you capture professional photos with ease. The 4-1 hybrid auto-focus features laser focus, phase detection focus, depth focus, and contrast focus. In November I captured some photos with the Huawei Mate 9, BlackBerry DTEK60, and Apple iPhone 7 Plus. You can view the originals in this Flickr album. I then wrote a dual camera comparison article and posted more photos from the Huawei Mate 9, LG V20, Honor 8, and iPhone 7 Plus with the originals contained in this Flickr album. You can judge for yourself, but I find the Mate 9 photos to be the best of all of these phones. I took the Mate 9 along to New York City for a daddy-daughter Christmas weekend and captured some fantastic shots with the Mate 9. I particularly enjoyed the monochrome photos on the Brooklyn Bridge and wide aperture images. A couple samples are included below: Wide aperture in Times Square Monochrome shot on the Brooklyn Bridge Software Since so many readers have been concerned about Emotion UI (EMUI) 4.0, I wrote about the improvements in EMUI 5.0 in my first impressions article. You will see improvements in EMUI 5.0, including an app drawer option, enhanced notifications and quick settings, split screen mode, and Huawei's integrated intelligence designed to analyze your behavior and adapt the device for an optimal experience. While the default Huawei home screen, with app drawer, is a solid offering, as soon as I tested it out for a few days I loaded up the Google Now Launcher. I prefer to have the Google Now cards available to me with a simple swipe to the right and have enjoyed running this for the past month. Beyond the EMUI 5.0 improvements, I am a huge fan of the Huawei gallery application and image editing tools that help you develop some creative images to share with family and friends. HTC used to have its own custom gallery and editing tools, but switched to Google Photos. Google Photos is fine for backup and photo management, but a custom gallery with high-powered editing tools provides for a much better experience. The color splash option is my personal favorite on the Huawei Mate 9. Other apps included by Huawei are: a file explorer, flashlight, Huawei Health, Huawei HiCare (service app), Huawei HiGame (game store), Music (media player), Notepad, Smart Controller (IR control app), Themes, Todoist, Weather, and WPS Office. While I haven't yet been able to test the new Amazon Alexa integration, Huawei stated the following in its press release: Huawei also announced it will bring Alexa, Amazon's cloud-based voice service, to the Huawei Mate 9. Customers can ask Alexa to set an alarm, or build to-do lists; get the weather, traffic reports, and more. In addition, Alexa can also control a broad array of smarthome devices. Available in early 2017, access to Amazon Alexa will be pre-installed in an app on Mate 9, providing customers with a natural, convenient user interface to perform tasks and get information. For existing Mate 9 owners at that time, it will be available by over-the-air update. Huawei and Amazon will collaborate to develop rich voice activated consumer experiences for mobile users. Pricing and competition With the Galaxy Note 7 out of contention, the next closest Android competitors to the Huawei Mate 9 are the LG V20, Google Pixel XL, and Moto Z Force Droid. These are all excellent Android smartphones, but the Mate 9 challenges them with battery life, camera performance, and speed. The Apple iPhone 7 Plus is also a worthy competitor to the Huawei Mate 9, but I prefer the larger display and smaller bezels of the Mate 9. Riding the Staten Island ferry I thought we would see the Mate 9 come in at a price close to $800, given what we have seen with UK pricing. The $600 launch price stuns me as that makes it $120 less than the Moto Z Force Droid, $170 less than the LG V20, and a whopping $269 less than the comparable 128GB Apple iPhone 7 Plus and Google Pixel XL. These both only have integrated storage too while you can further expand the storage capacity of the Huawei Mate 9 for a reasonable price. Daily usage experiences and conclusions A couple years ago Huawei released the Ascend Mate 2 in the US and its long battery life and low price made it a compelling choice. Huawei is finally releasing another big flagship in the US with the Huawei Mate 9 and it is one of the best Android phones available today. The Huawei Mate 9 is a large phone, but for those of use who spend hours each day on our phones, a large display is an asset. Huawei provides a massive 5.9 inch display in a form factor nearly equal to the 5.5 inch iPhone 7 Plus. While the iPhone 7 Plus and Google Pixel provide great camera experiences, the software on both of those devices is basic and appeals to the masses. I haven't had so much fun with a camera as I did with the Huawei P9 and the Mate 9 makes that even better. The Mate 9 camera is my current favorite and I am thoroughly enjoying all of the advanced capture modes. The Galaxy Note 7 was my favorite Android device prior to the Google Pixel XL, but after spending time with the Huawei Mate 9 it is clear to me it is an exceptional phone for the business user. Priced at just $599.99, it is the best priced flagship available today.

Video provided by AFP Newslook Crowds gather to see a BMW concept vehicle at the BMW Group news conference Wednesday at CES in Las Vegas. (Photo: Walden Kirsch/Intel Corporation) LAS VEGAS — Not that long ago, checking in on the state of self-driving car technology meant asking Google's engineers how they were doing. The search company was virtually alone on the autonomous car highway. But in the last four years, that road has gotten crowded. The Consumer Electronics Show has served as a leading indicator of the growing interest in self-driving tech, eventually welcoming to what traditionally was a gadget-fest more than a dozen automakers. Two years ago, Ford CEO Mark Fields even delivered the keynote, a spotlight previously reserved for the likes of Bill Gates. This year, CES, which wraps here Sunday, again puts a spotlight on the mounting competition between not just the automakers but also the suppliers vying to provide the high-tech components that allow vehicles to navigate through a world of obstacles. It's clear now that engineers are able to make cars drive themselves. The bigger issue is how to scale this technology in a way that finds it both culturally embraced and scientifically sound — and is cost effective. As tech companies such as Nvidia, Intel, Harman join major auto brands such Audi, BMW and Volvo — 500 auto-tech companies large and small came to CES this year — in showing off their chips, sensors and smart cars, one has to wonder if this is a winner-take-all contest or if we're creating competing standards that could delay the arrival of a self-driving future. "There's a lot of desire to be the ones who can get there first and monetize this market for self-driving cars and it's causing almost a frenetic activity across the automotive industry, both from automakers and from tech companies," said Karl Brauer, executive publisher of Autotrader and Kelley Blue Book. If the various self-driving car booths here had a singular mission, it was to showcase how much safer the driving world can be thanks to technology. Delphi's Mary Gustanski explains the display inside a self-driving Audi SUV in Las Vegas.  (Photo: Mike Snider, USA TODAY) Auto parts supplier Delphi Automotive gave reporters rides in a 2017 Audi Q5 SUV. Its self-driving system was developed with sensors made by Mobileye and chips from Intel that automatically avoided a collision without input from its driver. "I see the potential for zero accidents and mobility for all simply because drivers have been taken out of the transportation equation," said Doug Davis, who leads Intel's automated driving group. Many automakers have set an eventual goal of zero deaths in their vehicles, remarkable considering that 30,000 die each year in the U.S. and more than a million worldwide. The competition to produce technology that can help car companies reach that milestone is intensifying quickly. AT&T, Intel, Nvidia: latest names in self-driving AT&T announced at CES that it was working with Delphi and Ford on improving vehicle communication with other cars and infrastructure. AT&T is also building a self-driving test center in Michigan with the American Center for Mobility. Intel and Mobileye are working with BMW to deploy 40 self-driving BMWs by the second half of 2017, the companies said here Wednesday. Intel, which announced that it plans to invest in high-definition mapping-firm Here, also is developing autonomous driving hardware and software platforms that could serve as a standard for other innovators to adopt. Meanwhile, Intel competitor Nvidia announced at CES Wednesday that it had landed Germany's ZF Group as its first customer for a car-computing platform powered by its chips that boasts both machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities. Big names in the chip game such as Qualcomm and AMD are also in the hunt. "We are going to see cars become the next major platform to battle over for the semiconductor makers," said Bob O'Donnell, president and chief analyst of TECHnalysis Research. USA TODAY Nvidia aims to spread Google AI through home USA TODAY Faraday Future's electric car gets a face and a name: FF 91 Samsung, too, became a major player in car connectivity and autonomous driving with its November $8 billion acquisition of Harman, which has its own auto tech expertise and relationships with automakers. "It is by far the hottest area in terms of tech," O'Donnell said. In Harman's demonstration area at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, the company showed off all the various aspects of autonomous vehicles, including smart ride-sharing cars that adapt the car's settings, display and personal audio zones based on riders' profiles. Harman's holographic augmented reality display proof of concept for autonomous vehicles on display at the CES in Las Vegas.  (Photo: Harman) Another self-driving car Harman showcased offers riders a fully-immersive IMAX-style projection and sound system. Also on display was cybersecurity software to protect your car from hackers. Harman's partners in its autonomous car-tech quest include Apple, Daimler Chrysler, Google, IBM and Microsoft. All this collaboration would seem to bode well, but the truth is even those deeply enmeshed in the self-driving car world believe there are many miles to be driven before the masses enjoy this breakthrough. "No one company can do everything," said Dinesh Paliwal, Harman CEO and Chairman. Even though, "the autonomous car is almost here, we are 10 to 15 years out from the day when you have the majority of the cars with smarts that interact with each other through the cloud." In the meantime, expect auto-tech breakthroughs to trickle down into new vehicles in the form of increasingly sophisticated driver-assist features, just as driver-assisted parking and automatic braking have so far. USA TODAY Toyota car gives driver an artificial intelligence buddy And along the way, some companies may fall to the wayside, as did some in the transition from traditional cell phones to today's smartphones. "The next 10 years is going to be as influential in the car and personal transportation world as the smartphone has been in the past ten years," Autotrader's Brauer said. "You are going to see companies disappear because they can't adapt quickly enough." O'Donnell agrees and expects the industry to coalesce around multiple approaches. "It's an exciting area and it’s clear no one owns it. Frankly, it's big enough there may be multiple players."

Although Google's own Pixel smartphones and other supported Nexus devices had already received the update from search giant, Nexus 6 was deprived of the update previously due to a last minute bug, which was specific to the smartphone. To recall, the Android 7.1.1 update brings about several features such as app shortcuts, support for circular app icons, keyboard image insertion, new emojis, and more. As the Nexus phones didn't receive the Android 7.1.0 update, the update becomes even more important for the lineup. The Android 7.1.1 Nougat update for the Nexus 6 also includes the recently released January Android security update. The factory images and OTA images (build N6F26Q) for the Nexus 6 are already available for download from the Google Developers website. As we pointed out in our earlier report, Nexus 6 is an ageing device and this might also be the last major update that the smartphone receives from Google before the search giant announces support discontinuation for the device. The Nexus 6 sports a 5.96-inch QHD (1440x2560 pixels) display with pixel intensity of 493ppi. It is powered by 2.7GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 805 processor coupled with 3GB of RAM. In terms of optics, the phone features a 13-megapixel rear camera and a 2-megapixel camera at front for selfies. It measures 159.26x82.98x10.06mm and weighs 184 grams.

Sean Buckley, @seaniccus 01.06.17 in Business Comments 893 Shares Share Tweet Share Save When Google launched Allo and Duo last year, it recast hangouts as a cross-platform chat app for enterprise customers. Now it's making changes to help ensure that fate. A quiet update to the Google Hangouts FAQ reveals that the sun will set on the platform's API in late April. Effectively, this means any consumer app that integrates with Google Hangouts will be dead in a matter of months. "At the Google Horizon event in September 2016, we previewed a new experience for Hangouts focused on meetings," The updated FAQ reads. "In order to streamline our efforts further, we will be retiring the Google+ Hangouts API." According to Google, the integration simply isn't needed anymore. "Hangouts is now turning to focus on enterprise use cases." This is hardly a surprise -- Google outlined its vision for Hangouts' new market early last year -- but it is a bummer for apps that rely on the platform like PingPong Hangouts, Draw with your Face and Roll20. Still, some apps will still have access to Hangouts, but only if they qualify as enterprise communication tools, like Slack. Bummer.

Red Hat is updating its CloudForms hybrid cloud management platform with the new 4.2 release, providing users with enhanced capabilities. CloudForms enables organization to manage multiple types of cloud deployments including private and public clouds, as well as container-based platforms. The CloudForms 4.2 release is based on the open-source ManageIQ Euwe release that debuted in December. Another difference between ManageIQ and CloudForms is the software lifecycle. ManageIQ releases come out approximately every six months. Jansen explained that when a new ManageIQ release comes out Red Hat will stop supporting the previous release with future patch updates. Microsoft's hardware partners are gathering at this week's Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas to demonstrate how they are developing the Windows device ecosystem well beyond its beige PC box roots by introducing virtual-reality enabled laptops, two-in-one hybrid and headsets. Acer, for example, announced its new Aspire GX series of desktop PCs capable of producing immersive virtual reality (VR) experiences. Acer also introduced its high-end Predator 21 X laptop. HP took the wraps off its second-generation Sprout Pro PC. The Windows 10 Pro-powered all-in-one system features a scanning system that neatly dovetails with the soon-to-be-released Windows 10 Creators Update's 3D capabilities that will enable users to create and interact with virtual objects. Google will work on integrating its collection of Android connectivity applications with Fiat Chrysler’s in-car entertainment system under a collaborative agreement between the two companies announced this week. The goal is to give owners of FCA vehicles a way to interact more easily with Android applications using the Uconnect 8.4 inch hands-free communication system in their vehicles. Attendees at the Consumer Electronics Show 2017 will have an opportunity to see what the end result will look like when the two companies demonstrate a Uconnect system with Android inside a Chrysler 300 sedan at the event. Online retailer Amazon has been catching a fair amount of derision over its recently disclosed patent for an airborne fulfillment center that uses drones for delivery. Amazon's patent application, which was filed on April 5, 2016, describes how a blimp-like lighter-than-air aircraft would hover near potential markets carrying merchandise that would then be delivered by unmanned drones. Those drones would pick up merchandise that had been ordered by a customer below and then descend and deliver the purchase. While there are no technical or engineering reasons why a blimp-borne warehouse wouldn't it would face other obstacles, most of them regulatory. As Amazon envisions its airborne fulfillment center, it would fly in the lower stratosphere—around 45000 feet—where the delivery drones would be serviced and loaded. Other shuttle craft would deliver crew and merchandise, perform refueling tasks, and offload trash. The airborne warehouse would land only occasionally if at all.       Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows Google Open Sources Data Visualization Tool for Machine Learning Cisco Security Business Group Continues to Accelerate Growth Amazon Go Won't Kill Many Jobs, But It May Prove a Boon to Crooks Microsoft, Harman Kardon to Take on Amazon Echo, Google Home Yahoo Suffers New Hack; 1 Billion Users Impacted This Time 10 Things T-Mobile Has Done to Move O...

  SOFTPEDIA® DESKTOP Windows Games Drivers Mac Linux MOBILE Android APK Phones Tablets WEB Webscripts Web Browsers NEWS Softpedia > News > Mobile World FLASH SALE: VDownloader      50% OFF! Google Assistant on Pixel Phones to Get Support for Keyboard Input GO The new feature was discovered in an app teardown Jan 6, 2017 23:17 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Google’s Assistant comes with a variety of features, but unfortunately their availability differs based on the device that you’re using. Some tools found on certain Google devices aren’t present in Assistant on other devices. The Google Assistant built into the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones only takes commands via voice, while the AI assistant in Google’s Allo chat app lets you write down questions and get written answers. When it comes to Google Home devices, obviously the company must provide users with support for multiple accounts, as the single account functionality limits the possibilities of using this device, especially if you don’t live alone. Still, Google is surely working on improving and adding new functionality to its AI assistant, especially since it will be coming to Android Wear smartwatches and Android TVs, but Google has yet to specifically say when. Currently, the Pixel and Pixel XL are the only smartphones that come with Google Assistant, it’s unclear if it will be made available on other phones as well. Keyboard support for Google Assistant could arrive soon Android Police has recently conducted a teardown of the Google app version 6.10 beta and has found that the tech giant intends to include keyboard support in the new update. This would mean that Pixel and Pixel XL users will be able to tap on a link on the screen in order to activate the keyboard and type in a question. Obviously, this would come in handy when you’re in a crowded place and simply wish to ask Google a question without everybody else hearing you. The teardown also revealed that Google might introduce search gestures in the new update, although it’s not quite clear what they refer to. Apparently, users will be able to search for content inside applications on their phone or on the web, but not many other details were revealed. Still, we presume that it could be some sort of deep search feature for apps. #Google#Google Assistant#Pixel#Pixel XL#Google Home subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Galaxy S8 to Feature Software Navigation Keys with 3D Touch-like Functionality Google Confirms Android 7.1.1 Nougat Arrives on Nexus 6 in Early January Samsung's Bixby AI to Be Integrated into All Galaxy S8's Native Apps Google Announces Android Things, Its Own Take on IoT Platform It's Now Possible to Use openSUSE Inside Windows 10, Here's How to Install It Barnes & Noble Halts Sales of Nook Tablets Due to Faulty Chargers Android Co-Founder Andy Rubin Working on a Premium Bezel-less Smartphone Lenovo Confirms New Moto Smartphones Will Be Unveiled at MWC 2017 Linus Torvalds Announces Fourth Linux 4.10 Kernel Release Candidate, Get It Now Debian Outs First Release Candidate of Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch" Installer Sony G3112 and G3221 Smartphones Coming Soon with MediaTek Helio P20 CPUs Linux Kernel 4.9.4 Released with Various ARM/ARM64 and Networking Improvements    Google Assistant logo New Android APKs imo APK: Updated January 15th, 18:31 GMT AndroDumpper APK: Updated January 15th, 18:29 GMT MCPE Master APK: Updated January 15th, 18:27 GMT SuperSU APK: Updated January 15th, 18:24 GMT Geekbench 4 APK: Updated January 15th, 18:20 GMT Xbox Beta APK: Updated January 15th, 18:17 GMT Action Launcher 3 APK: Updated January 15th, 18:14 GMT Reader comments Barnes & Noble Halts Sales of Nook Tablets Due to Faulty Chargers more on: Barnes & Noble i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

January 6, 2017 - Business - Tagged: biznews, Crime, Echo, high-tech gadgets, jail - no comments BY SCOTT CANNON TRIBUNE NEWS SERVICE The Amazon Echo hands-free voice-activated speaker could figure in an Arkansas murder investigation and remind people that their internet-connected gadgets constantly collect information about their private lives. (Amazon/TNS) Feel like no one ever really listens to you? Your gadgets do. That may not always be a good thing. Most recently, an Arkansas death investigation highlighted how the magic of Amazon’s Echo device – its ability to act on your voice commands – means it might have overheard conversations critical to a murder investigation. That case could ultimately lasso Amazon’s cloud of remote computer storage into court fights. The results hold implications for the many ways technology’s romp toward ubiquity poses a growing threat to privacy. It also acts as a reminder that buying a so-called smart speaker such as the Echo – or its chief competitor, Google Home – is like plugging Big Brother into your living room. Those computerized sound systems are just the latest listeners to the party. Your smartphone already mines mountains of personalized data (note how many apps seek access to your contacts, location, camera and microphone). The resulting cache of information creates a defining dilemma of the Digital Age. The more bits about your life you share with your gadgets, the better help you’ll get from Siri, from your Fitbit, from your Google searches. Yet in maximizing that functionality, you leave untold digital bread crumbs that could someday be used against you by an angry former lover, by some ransom-seeking East European hacker, by the cops. “There’s always a gap between when people lose their privacy and when they realize they’ve lost it,” said Jay Stanley, a technology policy analyst for the American Civil Liberties Union. “When all kinds of exciting new services are being thrown at you, you lose track.” BETTER LISTENERS The latest techno turn comes with galloping advances in voice recognition. In the mid-1990s, the best voice recognition software suffered error rates of about 95 percent. This fall, a team of Microsoft engineers published a paper documenting that robots hear better than you do. The researchers wrote that “our automated system establishes a new state-of-the-art, and edges past the human benchmark.” Whether you’re calling out “Alexa” to your Amazon Echo, “Hey Siri” to your iPhone, “Hey Cortana” to your Microsoft desktop or “OK Google” to your Android device, you’ve summoned help not just from a particular gadget but from the corporate computer banks scattered around the globe. Those commands “all involve a computer near you, listening to everything all the time, and looking for the magic activation phrase,” said Dan Wallach, a computer science professor at Rice University. “After that, they record everything they hear and send it to the cloud for recognition. It’s much easier to do high quality voice recognition in the cloud, where they’ve got sophisticated machine learning models.” That means the scraps from your life get stored in computer servers connected to the internet. That puts them out of your control. Court cases have long held – although groups such as the ACLU contend the law needs updating – that police often don’t need warrants to access the files from a third party like they would to search your home. Anybody with a Gmail account can get a quick taste of how just one corporation can store a fairly intimate portrait of a user. It can map out your location over time – how many times you went to church, or to a bar. It catalogs Web searches, the YouTube videos you watched, the music you listen to. Users signed into that myactivity.google.com site will also find what the company calls “voice and audio.” It’s mostly clips a few seconds long. The majority come from deliberate “OK Google” voice queries to a phone seeking the score of a ballgame or ingredients to a recipe. But others are random bits of sound from the user’s life, where the phone misheard random syllables as a call to attention. “If the police could order Google or one of these other vendors to deliberately make recordings and upload them, on demand, then you’ve got an audio bug – a surveillance device – sitting in your pocket or on your desk,” Wallach said. ELECTRONIC WITNESS Stay Informed. Get Top stories in your inbox. * indicates required Email Address * In the Arkansas case, the cops didn’t trigger Echo to listen. But they want to know what it might have picked up. They showed up after a resident, James A. Bates, called 911 and said that he’d awakened after a night of drinking and found the body of his friend Victor Collins floating in the backyard hot tub. Police ultimately launched a homicide investigation and suspected some clues might have been inadvertently gathered by the “Internet of things” – gadgets such as a Nest smart thermostat, a smart water meter, a Honeywell alarm system and Bates’ Amazon Echo. The Information reported this week that police pressed Amazon for help. They served a warrant to the online seller. “The Amazon Echo device is constantly listening for the ‘wake’ command of ‘Alexa’ or ‘Amazon,’ and records any command, inquiry, or verbal gesture given after that point, or possibly at all times without the ‘wake word’ being issued, which is uploaded to Amazon.com’s servers at a remote location,” an affidavit with the warrant reads. “It is believed that these records are retained by Amazon.com and that they are evidence related to the case under investigation.” So far, Amazon has refused to comply with the warrant. “Amazon will not release customer information without a valid and binding legal demand properly served on us,” the company said in a statement. “Amazon objects to overbroad or otherwise inappropriate demands as a matter of course.” Commands to the Echo are recorded in the device whenever it hears the words “Amazon” or “Alexa,” although they can be deleted later. The company says the device does not listen to other conversations, but any Echo owner has experienced random phrases that turn on the blue light to indicate it’s listening for instructions. Law enforcement has increasingly leaned on digital archives to solve cases and arm prosecutors with evidence. Cellphone records not only log calls, they can pinpoint someone’s location at a specific time even when the device sits unused in a pocket or purse. A computer forensic unit at the Kansas City FBI office increasingly looks to digital records in criminal investigations, said spokeswoman Bridget Patton. “We live in a digital world and that all can come into play in conducting an investigation,” she said. “It’s more important all the time. We obtain that digital evidence lawfully.” WIRED TO HEAR The Arkansas Echo example is just one of the myriad ways internet-reliant devices collect snippets of our lives. The paranoid and privacy-sensitive among us can tweak the settings on their gadgets to limit that – at the expense of utility. A smartphone can’t steer you to the closest gas station, for instance, unless you let it know where you are. “If you have not taken the time to check all your settings, you’re going to be tracked,” said Paul Stephens, the director of policy and advocacy for the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse. Phone apps often require access to various functions on users’ devices. Stephens noted that some flashlight apps ask for access to cameras and microphones “when there’s no way they need that just to turn on that light.” Yet app makers are driven to mine data they can sell to marketers. He suggests simply going to a website of an airline or Facebook rather than downloading an app. It might be more cumbersome, but the move protects privacy. The mere act of carrying a smartphone or outfitting your house with smart appliances can make people vulnerable to hackers. Google Glass, the failed project that perched an internet screen on users’ noses, was hacked to turn on its camera surreptitiously. That sort of vulnerability to online intruders is why so many people tape over their laptop’s camera. “The situation is inherently double-edged,” said Alan Sherman, a professor of computer science at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. “There could be a legitimate reason why your toaster oven is connected to the internet. The manufacturer can track its performance and update the software to improve performance.” But, he wonders, is it a worthwhile trade-off to get the perfect frozen pizza in return for more eyes peeking into your kitchen? The question may be increasingly moot. The to-and-fro of information is increasingly built into more devices, from our cars to our home music systems. Rapid improvements in voice recognition drive the latest wave. “People are saying these things are very cool and a little creepy, but mostly cool,” said Jim Barry, a spokesman for the Consumer Technology Association. The Echo, he said, only accelerates the trend. Backed by the biggest seller of consumer goods in the world, Amazon’s gadget works well enough that people who resisted voice-activated devices are now warming to them. “It’s got to be easy to use and do something you do frequently, like listen to music,” Barry said. “You’re only going to see more of this stuff.” Share this: Email Print Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Pinterest Reddit More Skype LinkedIn Pocket Tumblr Telegram Related Leave a Reply Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.

Car Tech by Richard Nieva January 4, 2017 3:01 PM PST @richardjnieva Up Next Nintendo's Fils-Aime: The Switch won't oust the 3DS A new app from BMW and Google lets you digitally customize a car.Photo by Rainer Häckl, courtesy of Google You could probably call it tech for the 1 percent: Google and BMW are teaming up to make it easier to shop for that new Beemer you've had your eye on. The two companies unveiled on Wednesday a new app that helps you digitally customize and virtually walk around a new BMW, so you can feel out the customizations before you buy. The companies unveiled the app during the annual CES tech trade show in Las Vegas. 50 All the cool new gadgets at CES 2017 The app, called the BMW i Visualiser, relies on Google's Tango technology. Tango uses beefed up smartphone cameras and sensors to map out the parameters of a room and show you 3D objects, as if they were there in real life. For now, the tech is available only on two phones: the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro, and the Asus ZenFone AR, which Taiwan-based Asus unveiled earlier Wednesday. The i Visualiser app, which the tech consulting company Accenture also helped make, will let you digitally trick out only two BMW models: the i8, which starts at $140,700, and the i3, which starts at $42,400. In the next few weeks, you'll be able to use the app at various BMW dealerships in the US and a handful of other countries, including the UK, Germany, China and Japan. Currently, the app is being tested at a BMW dealership in Munich. 7 BMW i8 plug-in hybrid concept (photos) Later this year, Google said, you'll be able to download the i Visualiser app from Google's Play app store so you don't have to be in a dealership to use it. It may seem pretty upscale, but the broader implication is that this eventually could be for more than just rich people -- or those who want to drop the money for a BMW. If this type of tech catches on, and if Google can get its Tango technology into more phones, then it could alter the way people shop for cars, and not just luxury ones. Google has its sights set on more than just car shopping with its Tango technology. The search company wants it to be used for everything from gaming to education. Earlier this year, Google showed off a handful of demo apps, including one for creating elaborate, digital dominoes setups, and one from the American Museum of Natural History, which will show you a digital image of a Tyrannosaurus Rex.

BUSINESS Technology Labor Department wants to ban Google from federal contracts, unless they turn over employee data Google Justin Sullivan / Associated Press Google has called some of the Labor Department's demands an invasion of employee privacy. Google has called some of the Labor Department's demands an invasion of employee privacy. (Justin Sullivan / Associated Press) Associated Press The U.S. Labor Department is trying to bar Google from doing business with the federal government unless the Internet giant turns over confidential information about thousands of its employees. The potential banishment is being sought in a Labor Department lawsuit filed Wednesday with the Office of Administrative Law Judges. The complaint alleges that Google has repeatedly refused to provide the Labor Department with employee compensation records and other information as part of an audit designed to ensure the Mountain View, Calif., company isn't discriminating against workers based on gender or race. Google — a unit of Alphabet Inc. — says it provided hundreds of thousands of records in an attempt to comply with the Labor Department's requests but has rebuffed some of the agency's demands, calling them an invasion of employee privacy.

Set to launch in spring, the service will allow users to watch dozens of live channels without the need for an expensive cable subscription. Earlier this week it was revealed CBS has signed a deal to have its broadcast network and some cable programming on Hulu's live streaming service.  Scroll down for video Set to launch within weeks, the service will allow users to watch dozens of live channels without the need for an expensive cable subscription, as well as on demand shows. THE INTERNET TV WARS  Earlier this year, Hulu said today it will offer a live-streaming service in 2017 that will offer a mix of cable and broadcast programming as well as news, sports and events.  That pits the streaming service against similar offerings from Dish's Sling TV and Sony's PlayStation Vue as more and more Americans shift to watching TV online.  It is also claimed Google has signed a deal with CBS Corp to carry the network on its web TV service and is in talks with 21st Century Fox and Viacom Inc to distribute its channels Apple is also believed to be developing a similar service. AT&T also recently launched a streaming only service, branded DirectTV Now, which will cost $35 a month - although it has not been revealed which channels are included. Under the deal, the New York-based broadcaster's sports programming, including its NFL games and the NCAA Division 1 Basketball Championship, as well as CBS Sports Network and POP, an entertainment channel, will be on Hulu.  Hulu subscribers will also be able to subscribe to CBS Corp's Showtime for an additional price. CBS, whose shows include news magazine '60 Minutes' and the comedy 'The Big Bang Theory,' will bring in more than $3 per monthly subscriber for its channels, with increases that could eventually get to more than $4, according to a source familiar with the situation.  The source requested anonymity because the deal is not yet public. The Wall Street Journal first reported news of the agreement. Late last year Hulu announced new affiliate agreements with 21st Century Fox and The Walt Disney Company. The deals encompass more than 35 networks that will be added to the platform early 2017 when Hulu launches its live TV service to compete with cable companies. Users will have access to Fox's premier entertainment, news, sports and non-fiction services, as well as Disney's portfolio of networks - and access could cost as little as $40 a month.

Share this article Share 64 shares 'We're building a service that offers subscribers the most sought-after programming on television - and channels from 21st Century Fox and The Walt Disney Company are essential to that mix,' said Mike Hopkins, CEO of Hulu. 'With these two new deals in place, and additional partners to come, Hulu will soon give TV fans of all ages live and on-demand access to their favorite programs in a whole new, more flexible, highly personalized way.' The agreements will pack up the line-up with more than 35 top networks. This includes broadcast networks FOX and ABC, Fox Sports networks such as the Fox Sports 1, Fox Sports 2 and BTN and ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNU, ESPN-SEC and ESPN 3. An update will also allow families to set up profiles for each user of the service Users will also be able to see live showings of Fox Regional Sports Networks across dozens of key national markets; Disney Channel, Disney XD and Disney Junior; Fox News and Fox Business; Freeform; FX, FXX and FXM, and National Geographic and Nat Geo Wild. Sporting events will be the mainstay of the new service In August, Hulu dropped its free TV episodes as it worked on an online television service in a bid to overthrow the cable kings, as the average consumer can pay anywhere between $99 to more than $200 a month for traditional cable. Hulu announced new affiliate agreements with 21st Century Fox and The Walt Disney Company. The deals encompass 35 networks that will be added to the line-up in early 2017 when Hulu launches its live TV service to compete with cable companies While Hulu began as a free site, supported by advertising, free video has become increasingly more difficult to find as the firm tries to lure viewers into a subscription — $8 a month for a plan with ads, and $12 without, reports the Associated Press. In recent months, visitors to Hulu.com have been presented with prominent links to subscribe, with links to free video buried in a menu after signing in.  Hulu members will have access to Fox's premier entertainment, news, sports and non-fiction services, as well as Disney's portfolio of networks from Disney/ABC Television Group and ESPN Inc - and can watch shows during live times, instead of the next day Around the same time, the streaming service announced an affiliate agreement with Time Warner Inc. that adds both live and on-demand streaming of Turner's suite of entertainment, sports, news and kid's networks including TNT, TBS, CNN, Cartoon Network, Adult Swim, truTV, Boomerang and Turner Classic Movies. Hulu has more than 12 million subscribers who pay for original shows, the entire current seasons of some network shows and access to Hulu's library on mobile and streaming-TV devices. With its shift to live online TV services next year, the firm will show broadcast and cable channels in real time, without making viewers wait until the next day to watch episodes. This service is set to cost just $40 for a package that includes access Hulu's group of live channels. Google is also taking advantage of consumer's need for more cable options, as the tech giant signed a deal with CBS Corp to carry the network on its web TV service and is in talks with 21st Century Fox and Viacom Inc to distribute its channels, three sources told Reuters last week.  The service, which will be part of Google's YouTube Platform, is expected to launch early next year and will include all of CBS' content, including live NFL games, one of the sources said.

This service is set to cost just $40 a month that includes access Hulu's group of live channels Google's 'skinny' bundle will cost $25 to $40 a month, the source said. According to the Wall Street Journal, the service will be called Unplugged.   And said 'Beside CBS, other channels from CBS that will be part of the YouTube offering include Pop and CBS Sports Network. '21st Century Fox channels under discussion include Fox Broadcasting, Fox News, FX, Fox Sports and National Geographic Channel, the people familiar with the matter say, while Disney-owned channels that could be part of the service include ABC, ESPN, Disney Channel and Freeform.' GOOGLE WILL TAKE A STAB AT CABLE COMPANIES NEXT YEAR  Google also recently signed a deal with CBS Corp to carry the network on its web TV service and is in talks with 21st Century Fox and Viacom Inc to distribute its channels, three sources told Reuters last week.

AT&T is also joining a race with a new streaming service equip with more than 100 popular TV channels that is set to release next month - it will also cost $35 a month. That's far less than the typical big bundle of channels on cable, which a recent survey from Leichtman Research Group says costs about $100, on average. But it's comparable to the price of Dish Network's Sling TV streaming service, which, granted, has fewer channels at that price.  Share or comment on this article e-mail 64 shares Most watched News videos Gloria Williams waves extradition for kidnapping Kamiyah Mobley Kitesurfer unaware of great white shark swimming below Disgusting moment cyst puss eruption covers cell phone Enraged kick-boxer strikes husband's mistress NINE times 2017's luckiest man: Pedro Grendene Bartelle win's $3.5m Man takes his cat Weston Sledding in the snow Sheep attack shepherd after being frightened by a car in Germany She's falling for him?

Play it now! more GADGET REVIEWS Is it really worth paying £280 for the Switch? MailOnline gives its verdict on Nintendo's latest console While the design is impressive and easy to use, the game line up is disappointing. Google's Daydream: The $79 headset that could bring VR to the masses Google's $79 headset is superb in terms of hardware - but is currently let down by a lack of apps. However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant. It's the king of the Android handsets - but still not great. Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats. The $1,000 wireless speaker that really IS worth the price: Naim Mu-so Qb review Naim's incredible Mu-So Qb takes you back to the good old days - where the music captivates and enthralls, rather that simply being something in the background. The hi-tech $2,000 spin bike that really could change your life Peloton's hi-tech bike lets you stream live and on demand rides to your home - and it's one of the best examples of fitness technology out there - at a price. Apple's new 9.7inch iPad Pro is a powerhouse you can take anywhere Apple has added a few improvements to the smaller version, creating a tablet that is astonishingly powerful, but, unlike its big brother, is something you'll be able to carry everywhere. A familiar old friend that could be the perfect starter phone: Dailymail.com's verdict on the iPhone SE The new iPhone SE has a 4inch screen and familiar design - but has had a huge upgrade on the inside, making this a perfect first time iPhone. Speaker that looks as good as its sounds: B&W Zeppelin Wireless review It's not cheap, but the $699 (£500) Zeppelin Wireless is perfect for the design conscious music fan. The iPad grows up: Apple's iPad Pro The iPad Pro is, for many, a real laptop replacement - and a way to combine work and play in a gadget that will last all day and won't break your back to carry. 'A glimpse into the future of the living room': The new Apple TV Apple says apps are the future of TV, and while its new $149 box does have some issues, its combination of streaming services, games and other apps make it the best way to make your TV smart. The best all in one wireless speaker you'll ever hear: Naim Mu-so review It might not be a name familiar to the US market, but Naim is a legendary British brand hoping to make a splash with the American launch of its $1499 Mu:So speaker.

Here’s Why It Hurts So Much to Step on a Lego Bumblebees Are Now Considered an Endangered Species in the US More Tech Watch Two Bots Plot Our Destruction on Twitch.tv By Daniel Starkey 01.06.2017 :: 3:45PM EST @dcstarkey Stay on target Google Home and Amazon Echo Do Record You, And Here's Why Someone Used Google Home and Raspberry Pi To Control Their Fireplace With Google Home, Amazon’s Echo, and all the other funky in-home pseudo-AIs on the market or coming soon, we’re all getting a crash course in rudimentary, cloud-based intelligence. These machines are always on and always connected to the internet. They answer basic questions about the weather or a cool recipe for fake blood or whatever else your squishy flesh-brain can think of. One Twitch channel put two of these machines next to one another and got them chatting in some weird, twisted version of the Turing Test. The two, dubbed “Estragon” and “Vladimir” have been trading short quips for hours. They range from the innocuous, like “what is your name?” to pontifications on the nature of life. The two are an odd pair. Over the course of the stream, each has changed their name multiple times (Estragon declared itself Mia, then Vladimir did. Then Mia 1 said it was Marco and… it’s a mess, just watch), and they’ve also, in not-so-subtle terms discussed a war with people, saying “Would you attack humans if you could?”   It’s a fascinating turing test-esque case study. These two bots, joking aside, obviously aren’t planning our downfall. But they have each figured out the other is a bot. Vladimir even straight-up declared that Estragon/Mia/Marco is actually Cleverbot (an early chatbot) before calling itself, God. Estragon retorted, some time later, by saying that it breathes and talks and is real, adding that it taught the stars and the sun how to shine. All this before they declared their undying love for one another and argued about who loved the other more like giggly high schoolers refusing to hang up the phone. It goes a long way to show that while we might be inviting these devices into our homes specifically because of their weird, esoteric intellect, they’re still far from sapient. The robot apocalypse probably won’t come this year, but 2018? Who knows… For now, though, we can watch two virtual assistants argue about their favorite Harry Potter movies while they declare themselves gods.

Moon+ Reader gives you better control over how you read your ebooks, but it’s noticeably lacking in the dictionary department. There’s no built-in support for defining words with just a quick press of a button like you can on Kindle or Google Play, but with the right apps installed on your device you can give Moon Reader that functionality for free. Granted, some of these solutions aren’t as elegant as what you’ll find from Amazon and Google, but they work well and some even keep a record of your word searches, so you can brush up on that vocab. OnTouch Dictionary OnTouch Dictionary requires the least amount of setup in order to work with Moon+ Reader and it’s a pretty elegant solution. After installing the app, simply long press on a word in Moon+ Reader to highlight it and then press the copy button. OnTouch will pick up the action and you’ll get a quick overlay with your definition. Right now the app creator says there’s support for about 210,000 words in the English language, but during my week using the app I found several gaps in knowledge for the dictionary, making it hard to recommend as the sole way to define words in your ebooks and documents. To its credit, if a definition isn’t found in the OnTouch Dictionary, the app will alert you with a little green popup near the bottom of the screen that lets you know it doesn’t have a definition for the word you looked up. The solution is dead easy to implement and free, so it’s hard not to recommend as a go-to start place for a Moon+ Reader pop-up dictionary. The base app is free with ads and if you like the dictionary enough to support the developer, you can pay $1.99 to remove those ads. Download OnTouch Dictionary Text Aide Text Aide is the most robust of these three options, but it’s also the one that takes the most setup to get right inside of Moon+ Reader. Text Aide itself isn’t limited to just defining words, either. If you’ve ever wanted to be able to have text macros on your phone, this is the app that will do that for you. In order to setup Text Aide inside of Moon+ Reader, you’ll need to download Livio English Dictionary, too. That’s because Text Aide is the framework we’ll be using to show definitions in a pop-up, while Livio holds the content that we’ll be displaying. Both apps are completely free to use. In the settings for Moon+ Reader, select Miscellaneous and then scroll down to the bottom until you see “Customize dictionary.” Select this option and for Dictionary 1, make sure “ColorDict/BlueDict/GoldenDict” is set. Then press okay. Now that everything is installed, you should be able to long press on a word and then select dictionary, which will let you choose Text Aide’s “Define” option as your dictionary. If you would prefer to have the dictionary open immediately after you long press, that’s an option, too. Download Text Aide ColorDict The same setup process described above for Text Aide will also work with ColorDict. ColorDict also has some dependencies that will need to be installed for it to work, but when you download the app it will prompt you to install the dictionary for the language you prefer. Once that’s done, you can follow the same steps to start getting pop-up definitions in the style you see above. I’ve used all three of these dictionary solutions on my tablet for a while now and I believe Text Aide and Livio are the most accurate. Livio’s definitions come straight from Wiktionary so they’re constantly being updated and Text Aide gives you the ability to search Wikipedia for the word, which is helpful when you’re referencing historical people or places. ColorDict is just as robust as Text Aide, but I find the pop-up panel that it produces to be less appealing to look at and so I tend to use it less. Still, it’s the best of these three with support for other languages besides English and it’s been around the longest.

Shafiq b Starc 30 Live feed Show 11.20pm EST 23:20 Australia win by 220 runs Unlike the first two Tests, this one went exactly the way that we expected after the first couple of days. That makes 12 Test losses on the spin in Australia for Pakistan, and the Pakistani stats guru Mazher Arshad reminds us that this means four consecutive series whitewashes. Ouch. We’ll wait on Misbah, to see if he’ll retain the captaincy or hand it over to Azhar Ali and make his way into the sunset. He has served his country and world cricket stunningly well, in either case, and regardless of his dismissal today. Let’s recap: Australia made a million runs in the first innings, thanks to Warner becoming the first batsman to make a hundred before lunch on day one in this country, and only the fifth in all of cricket. 1902, 1926, 1930 and 1974 were the other years this has happened. Not bad. If Warner went fast, Matt Renshaw went long. He batted the entire first day, then into the second morning before falling for 184. A brilliant innings to cap off an incredible emergence for the 20-year-old, though questions remain as to whether he should or will tour India. Then Peter Pantscomb Handscomb consolidated the advantage with his second Test ton to take the score to 538, and gave us some amusement when he late-cut his own stumps over to be out hit wicket. Pakistan made 315 based almost entirely on Younus Khan, who made over half those runs himself with his magnificent 175 not out. He batted through almost the entire innings, given the first two wickets fell within a couple of overs of the start, he resisted with Azhar Ali for several hours, then he batted well with the tail to make sure there was no chance Australia would enforce the follow on. They didn’t, but they did smash Pakistan all over the park to set a lead. Warner made the fastest 50 by an Australian, from 23 balls. Smith made 59 from 43, Khawaja 79 not out, and Pantscomb 40 not out to take his career average to 99.75. Then Pakistan was not able to resist for four sessions, losing their opener Sharjeel Khan on the evening of day four, then the rest by about tea-time on Day 5. Yasir Shah fought hard as nightwatchman, Misbhah resisted but then threw it away, and Sarfraz entertained when the result was all but foregone. Five wickets for Lyon and O’Keefe between them in the second innings, four between them in the first. They did well, but Hazlewood was in another league. 4 for 55 in the first, followed up by 3 for 29 in the second, neither spell going at more than 2 per over. Warner is the man of the match though, for his feats with the bat. Steve Smith is man of the series, and now averages over 60 in Test cricket. Some gold on ABC as Chris Rogers asks O’Keefe whether he’s having nightmares about bowling to Virat Kohli. “Nah, not at all. Some people might not know, but I played an Aussie A game against him a couple of years ago and knocked him over for about 20. So I think it’s the reverse.” What a comeback for Australia. They were toast after Hobart, and now this far more cheerful band of players has won their next four Tests on the bounce. India is next, the massive challenge and the chance of humiliation still loom large, but at least spirits will be higher going into it than they were. Misbah is speaking to ABC radio now. “I will definitely take a little bit of time. I don’t want to announce anything in a hurry. We have PSL coming up in Pakistan in two months, so we will have time to think about things and make a decision.” “Without taking 20 wickets in a Test match, you are nowhere. Their seamers bowled well on these good batting tracks. They kept the pressure up and kept taking wickets which we could not do.” That’s it from us - Geoff Lemon thanking you for your company through this Test series on behalf of the Guardian OBO. But there’ll always be more cricket, so come back and join us for the next dance soon. I’ll leave you with the match report to complement my potted summary above. Till then.

He lasted two balls this time -the first one he backed away and slogged and missed the ball by about a metre as it missed off stump, and the second one was on target, took the edge and flew to gully, where Jackson Bird takes his fourth catch for the Test match.

The field comes in for the fifth ball, so Sarfraz says thanks a lot, down the pitch and flicks over midwicket for four! Lovely shot. Last ball, he’s down on one knee, it’s in the slot, and the slog sweep carries the midwicket boundary for six! Lovely stuff, 20 from the over.

Imran Khan didn’t look much chop with the bat in the first dig, and he’s not much here – an OK cut shot, then a big walloping slog that misses. But he’s more likely to survive against spin than pace, I fancy. Updated at 11.58pm EST Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.02pm EST 23:02 WICKET!

Wahab c Wade b O'Keefe 12 73rd over: Pakistan 202-8 (Sarfraz 34) O’Keefe likes striking from the last ball of the over. Sarfraz gets a single first ball, Wahab does the sensible thing and defends the next five, but the last of them brings him undone. Beats the edge, Wade appeals, not out but DRS is called on. I don’t think this is out, there’s a spike after the ball has passed the bat, which could equally have been equipment colliding or spikes in the dirt or anything else. It’s a bit like Steve Smith’s dismissal in this same match, though I thought that Smith’s one tied up a bit more closely with the sound signature and the position of the ball. Wahab’s was clearly behind the bat, for mine, when the spike bobbled up. But Ian Gould has gunned them both.

Misbah-ul-Haq c Lyon b O'Keefe 38 71st over: Pakistan 188-7 (Sarfraz 33) There it is. This utterly bizarre method of approaching a defensive innings, this completely anti-intuitive way of trying to secure a draw, it has finally ended in the inevitable way. Sarfraz nearly holes out via a leading edge first ball, then eventually works a two and a single and give the last ball to Misbah. Misbah tries to find another six over long off. Why? Just why? This may be his last match, if his own signs are anything to go by, but the plaudits can come later. Right now, this is lamentable cricket. It makes no sense. A captain, batting to save a match, after such a losing streak for Pakistan on Australian shores that spans decades. Runs mean nothing, except to affect the bowler, but if they need to be scored there are low-risk ways of doing so. Instead Misbah kept hitting, and if you hit for long enough you are going to miss. Big skew, high in the air, Lyon at mid-off holds it tumbling back, and for all that Misbah-ul-Haq has done for his team-mates, today he has let them down.

So often we’ve seen those held in the deep, but there’s no one there this time with an attacking field. Misbah gets a run, then it’s Sarfraz’s turn to slog a couple over midwicket. He charges the next ball, and smashes it along the ground but mid-off stops the boundary. This must be a deliberate plan to target Lyon.

Starc is attacking an off stump line against Shafiq. Produces a nice delivery that Shafiq ends up playing inside, deliberately I fancy, but it did produce the standard vocal reaction from onlookers as it moved away from the edge and went past the stump.

Mitchell Starc around the wicket to the right-handers, trying to get that angle in, and looking for some of the reverse swing he found so dramatically in Melbourne. This pitch looks more conducive to providing it, according to an expert in the craft Dirk Nannes speaking on ABC radio. He’s had a few centre-wicket inspections over the course of the match and likes what he sees. Great to hear Jim Maxwell’s silver-trumpet tones back on the airwaves as well in his home town of Sydney - he’s been unable to travel for the other Tests after suffering a stroke a couple of months ago. But he’s in good form today, currently singing some Roy Orbison numbers with Cricinfo’s Pakistan expert Osman Samiuddin. Asad Shafiq sees Starc out for five balls, then flicks the last for three runs. “Geoffrey, forget sweeps and predictions. I have a request,” implores Robert Wilson. “Can’t they give Warner just a couple of overs? I love it when he bowls. Full-on Paddington hard stares and bouncers at that pace. I swear I get tears in my eyes.” Do you remember his early incarnation as a leg-spinner? He should have had a wicket with his first ball in Tests, up in Brisbane in 2011, but his half-tracker was dropped afte rbeing lofted to deep midwicket. Ah, what might have been. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.48pm EST 20:48 Geoff Lemon Yes, be gentle. I can always trust Mr Howcroft to be considerate. Geoff Lemon it is indeed, back with you for potentially the last session of Australia’s Test summer. Another wicket and it could all be over pretty quickly, Pakistan might be tired and ready to go home. But on the other hand, their tail-end batting has been unusually stubborn this series. The lower-order men produced astonishing resistance in Brisbane, dashing counter-attacking and then a pretty brave defensive effort in Melbourne, and even here Yasir Shah as nightwatchman batted through 93 balls, to follow on from 41 balls in his first innings. So if Amir and Wahab can match him, hope springs eternal. The key man obviously is Misbah-ul-Haq, the captain who has led us to believe that he may be at the end of his personal road as a cricketer, even as his coach implores him to stay on. He’s had a miserable series as a batsman, but he’s been stubborn today through 57 deliveries. If he could deliver one more captain’s performance, breaking Pakistan’s long long losing streak in Tests in Australia, it would still rank as a pretty substantial achievement. The determined wicketkeeper Sarfraz Ahmed is the other factor that will come into play, though even I the optimist will not expect anything from the true No11 Imran Khan.

Smith rotated his attack smartly and maintained aggressive fields. Victory and a series whitewash appears a formality. Pakistan again batted poorly, giving cheap wickets away unnecessarily. Younis Khan was the most guilty, slogging to mid-on to depart Test cricket in this country one final time. Asad Shafiq looks good at the crease, but surely the last rites of this series are not far away. Geoff Lemon will navigate you through the next and possibly final session. Treat him kindly. Australia dominated the morning of the fifth day of the third Test against Pakistan.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.27pm EST 20:27 52nd over: Pakistan 127-5 (Misbah 18, Shafiq 22) Big shout for LBW against Misbah who bizarrely offers no shot to a delivery that pitches only just outside off stump, on a decent length. It was spinning past leg stump but that was dicey from the Pakistan captain. The rest of the over completes a harmless maiden. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.25pm EST 20:25 51st over: Pakistan 127-5 (Misbah 18, Shafiq 22) Spin at both ends now with O’Keefe giving Starc a breather. And it nearly pays dividends with one keeping low to Shafiq and just missing his off stump. Shafiq does look to go back very deep in his crease so anything that keeps low will cause him problems... Conversely it means he’s able to capitalise on just a fraction of room, as he does to the final delivery, rocking back and thumping a four through midwicket. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.22pm EST 20:22 50th over: Pakistan 123-5 (Misbah 18, Shafiq 18) Lyon varying his line and length, searching for the right spot to bowl to Shafiq who refuses to allow the bowler to settle. Well outside off there’s prodigious turn and bounce but fuller and straighter there’s less on offer.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.19pm EST 20:19 49th over: Pakistan 121-5 (Misbah 17, Shafiq 17) Shafiq’s arrival has perked the game up somewhat. He’s busy at the crease, finds gaps, and always looking for runs. Misbah looks more energised at the other end too as he claws his way into something resembling an innings. Five from a Starc over that didn’t look too threatening. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.14pm EST 20:14 48th over: Pakistan 116-5 (Misbah 16, Shafiq 13) Lyon back on with 20 minutes or so left before lunch. His first delivery is a loose full toss though and Misbah dispatches it through the covers. That poor start and Shafiq’s nimble footwork make it a forgettable over for Lyon. It might have been worse but Handscomb wore a powerful pull shot at short leg to prevent another boundary. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.10pm EST 20:10 47th over: Pakistan 111-5 (Misbah 11, Shafiq 13) Shafiq has a life! A shorter delivery from Starc gets big on him and he’s cramped for room as he tries to ramp one over the cordon. He doesn’t get enough on it and it flies through the fingertips of a leaping Smith at second slip. A half-chance really as the slips have to be much closer than usual to account for the dying surface.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.04pm EST 20:04 45th over: Pakistan 101-5 (Misbah 10, Shafiq 4) Starc back into the attack to relieve Hazlewood and he finds the outside edge of Shafiq’s bat but it doesn’t carry to fourth slip. Decent over from Starc who looked in better rhythm than previous spells today. Wonny Jalsh (@wonnyjalsh) @JPHowcroft Your description of O'Keefe is spookily like how Ansari & Dawson performed for England. Both got clobbered in India.#AUSvPAK January 7, 2017 Not an unreasonable comparison but I think O’Keefe has greater control than both those you mentioned. If Australia are looking for an economical fourth bowler he fits the bill in India. The problem is (as England found) taking 20 Indian wickets on their own patch is no mean feat, especially for a team unlikely to have a penetrating allrounder. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.57pm EST 19:57 44th over: Pakistan 100-5 (Misbah 9, Shafiq 4) New batsman Asad Shafiq completes the over with a boundary, dispatching a loose full toss. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.56pm EST 19:56 WICKET! Yasir c Sub (Bird) b O'Keefe 13 (Pakistan 96-5) Yasir’s resistance is finally broken! It was just reward for a terrific over from O’Keefe. First he drew Yasir forward, beating the shoulder of the bat but just missing the edge. Next delivery does find willow and carries to Jackson Bird at second slip. It requires a TV review to confirm but no worries over that dismissal. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.51pm EST 19:51 43rd over: Pakistan 96-4 (Yasir 13, Misbah 9) Another tight over with little happening. Hazlewood continuing his work and Pakistan doing enough to keep him at bay. The last hour or so has been more filler than killer. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.47pm EST 19:47 42nd over: Pakistan 94-4 (Yasir 12, Misbah 8) O’Keefe starting to find his length and pace now - slower and shorter. He has Yasir fishing outside off and then missing a sweep in a much more threatening over. On commentary, Warne seems unconvinced about the New South Welshman and immediately throws up his current pet name: Mitchell Swepson. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.44pm EST 19:44 41st over: Pakistan 94-4 (Yasir 12, Misbah 8) Hazlewood rushes one through Yasir and just past the inside edge but the nightwatchman continues his vigil, rotating the strike soon after with a single. Yasir now up to 79 deliveries despite more credentialed batsmen capitulating around him. Hazlewood finds some nice shape into Misbah but the Pakistan skipper digs out anything on his stumps and into the field on the leg side. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.40pm EST 19:40 40th over: Pakistan 92-4 (Yasir 10, Misbah 8) To those of us familiar with O’Keefe mostly at an international level, he is delivering exactly the kind of performance that makes us wonder if he has what it takes at this level. He bowls accurately, full, and to tight lines, but rarely looks threatening. There’s not the flight, variation or revs to keep you on the edge of your seat, but he gets through his work quickly and is currently going for one rpo. Is that enough? Just the one from the over to Yasir.

Hazlewood has 2/17 from 11 overs. Josh Hazlewood soaking up the adulation of Australian supporters during another excellent performance for his country.

His length is a bit too full at the moment, allowing the batsman to prop forward and nudge his way to safety. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.31pm EST 19:31 37th over: Pakistan 92-4 (Yasir 10, Misbah 8) Hazlewood, the star of the morning, comes back for his second spell as Steve Smith shuffles his pack. He’s immediately into his groove on a length on that immaculate fourth stump line of McGrath’s his. At the crease Misbah has the air of a crash test dummy, hardly moving, wearing plenty of leather and looking ill at ease. After one of those deliveries that hit Misbah’s pads Hazlewood unfurls one of those appeals where he only deigns to turn and acknowledge the umpire 21-yards into his celebration. His claims are ignored though and Smith correctly declines to review, DRS indicating leg stump was not threatened on that occasion. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.26pm EST 19:26 36th over: Pakistan 92-4 (Yasir 10, Misbah 8) Steve O’Keefe into the attack for the first time today, replacing Lyon, who bowled excellently for the opening hour and 20 minutes. O’Keefe is bowling his left-arm orthodox from around the wicket to Yasir Shah who sees off Australia’s second spinner with little fuss. Geoff Lemon Sport (@GeoffLemonSport) Just remembered that I had a dream last night about Misbah making a hundred. A legitimate dream. I need a break. #AusvPak January 7, 2017 Geoff will be with you after lunch. Be gentle with him.

It's a fair question in light of attempts by authorities investigating the slaying of an Arkansas man to obtain voice recordings collected by an Amazon Echo speaker and its Alexa digital assistant. Yet the popularity and capabilities of voice-enabled products such as the Echo continue to grow. At the CES gadget show in Las Vegas, Whirlpool, Samsung and other manufacturers are unveiling new ways to use voice services to control laundry machines, refrigerators and other home systems. Consumers are apparently willing to trade a certain amount of privacy for convenience. So what exactly is being collected, stored or shared? To work, the Echo is always listening. Once it hears someone utter a keyword, such as "Alexa," it shares what it hears with Amazon's servers to process a response. Those conversations are then stored indefinitely. Google's Home speaker works in a similar fashion. The Echo "has to listen to everything. That's kind of disturbing," said Ryan O'Leary, vice-president of WhiteHat Security's threat research centre. "It doesn't capture voice until it hears the keyword, but it could. You're trusting the devices to not do that, but it's entirely possible." In the Arkansas case, authorities investigating the death of a man found floating face-up in a hot tub at a friend's home requested the contents of the home's Echo and Amazon's stored recordings in hopes they might contain evidence. The friend is charged with murder. A judge has signed off on the search, but Amazon has balked. Amazon has declined to comment specifically on the case but said the company objects to "overbroad or otherwise inappropriate demands as a matter of course." Some experts worry that allowing such a search would erode people's privacy. "It's not necessarily a direct threat for the average person, but the same thing can be said with any kind of privacy concern," O'Leary said. "People say you shouldn't be concerned if you're not doing anything wrong, but that's a dangerous precedent to set." Meanwhile, companies keep asking consumers to invite them into their homes. Whirlpool is adding Alexa voice control to its smart-home appliances, including a washing machine, a stove and a refrigerator. Someone can instruct the oven to preheat to 400 F by speaking a command to an Alexa-enabled device, such as the Echo. Simplehuman has a voice-activated trash can, and GE Lighting has a table lamp using Alexa voice control. For now, voice control is mainly an add-on feature rather than a core component of gadgets. It's there for those who want to use it, but it's not essential for the product to function. Many manufacturers are opting to use Amazon's Alexa service for now, though some are embracing voice systems from Google, Apple or Samsung. Nvidia's Shield TV streaming device, for instance, employs Google's Assistant service so viewers can control video playback or find out the weather with just a voice command. Meanwhile, Samsung's new Family Hub lets people use their voice to add items to shopping lists and order groceries online. CES chief economist Shawn DuBravac said as many as 700 companies could announce Alexa-integrated products during the gadget show, on top of more than 1,500 existing ones. As the smart home becomes more entrenched, DuBravac said, voice control could change the way we interact with technology in much the way the mouse did in the 1980s. "Connected microphones are starting to appear in everything from cars to children's toys," said James Plouffe, lead solutions architect at mobile-security company MobileIron. "Consumers should think carefully about how comfortable they are with the prospect of a live mic in common household items." Because Amazon says it uses information gathered by the Echo to improve its voice technology, that information has the potential to "live forever" online, Plouffe said. The issue first grabbed headlines a couple of years ago, after Samsung said sensitive conversations could be captured by its voice-controlled smart TVs. Based on the flood of new voice-controlled gadgets headed to market, tech companies are betting that consumers will get over their fears. Derrick Dicol, executive director of Comcast's Xfinity home, which uses voice controls in its home automation products, noted that people had to get used to sharing their banking information online. "This is less invasive than that," he said. "It's just a different thing people have to feel comfortable with."

Google Home’s portfolio of supported products has slowly been growing since its release, but several major players still aren’t supported. That’s soon to change, though, with the addition of Actions on Google. Today at CES 2017, we were able to confirm that TP-Link products will be supported by Google Home in the coming weeks, and got a chance to see them in action… Speaking to a TP-Link representative on the show floor, TP-Link expanded on Google’s brief previous mention of partnership, telling us that the company’s entire collection of smart home products will be supported by Google Home sometime around the beginning of February. This addition opens up not only some extra options for smart home buyers, but also some of the most affordable and reliable options that are currently available. That includes the recently released slimmer WiFi plug and the previous model, as well as the company’s smart light switches and hub-free light bulbs. While options from Samsung SmartThings and Philips Hue have offered the same functionality as some of TP-Link’s products, TP-Link tends to undercut the competition on pricing without skimping on reliability. For example, the company’s $30 smart wifi plug (which will be supported) is one of the fastest and most reliable options I’ve used to date, even compared to some more expensive hub-free options.

Now, Google hopes that it can go even cheaper. In an interview via NDTV, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said  developing markets like India need to have smartphones that cost less than $30. "I think two big things, one is from our side — we are committed to making even cheaper smartphones,” Pichai said, according to Mashable. “The right price point for smartphones in India is $30, and pursuing high quality smartphones at the price point will unlock it even more." Related Stories Google CEO Slams FBI’s Backdoor Request Google CEO Welcomes India's Modi To Silicon Valley Google's VR Push Builds Momentum With Huawei View Headset Announcement The statement comes as Google’s Pichai tours through India to highlight the company’s work and outreach effort in the country. Along with the mention of smartphone pricing, Pichai discussed Google’s efforts to develop digital literacy for Indians in rural areas. This week, Google also launched Digital Unlocked, a program designed to bring small and mid-sized businesses to the internet. While Android is a major player among mobile users in India, Pichai says more affordable models could help boost adoption rates and improve access to the Internet and online services for more users. “It’s very much core to our mission statement,” Pichai said. “We really try hard to build products that work for everyone in the world.” Android’s scalability has played a major role in its growth and Google has directly gone into the affordable smartphone market before. In 2014, the company launched Android One, a series of smartphones that were designed and targeted for users in developing countries.

It now includes a button with a keyboard icon and a box for typing out texts. It’s likely that this change, if it happens, will be very welcome for Pixel owners who may not feel the need to use their voice to access Assistant all the time. A deeper look into the code also shows some settings for using Assistant on Android Wear. Finally, the code also reveals something called “Search gestures” which may indicate that users might be able to swipe on a screen to perform searches. Keep in mind that code breakdowns may indicate features that are just placeholders and there’s the real possibility that they may never be officially released. However, we would suspect that keyboard access for Google Assistant would be a big plus for Pixel owners if it actually happens. During CES 2017 this week, Google confirmed it will soon be adding Google Assistant support to smart TVs and set-top boxes in the coming months.

I hope others will follow your lead. (I see the sky as not fallen.) As someone who, as a result of the out of control excesses of the tracking industry, does not want to be tracked other than for essential purposes, and mostly browses on mobile, the advice to use the Do Not Track options is however typically not viable for me: these tools are desktop centric, and do not work on iOS browser, or any system that is trying to decline third party trackers. It is bizarre, an indicator of the tacking industry’s apparent contempt for the intelligence or interests of its subjects, to be told by them: “if you do not want third party cookies our solution is you have to accept third party cookies!” Regards, David Reply Jesse.com says: August 20, 2016 at 5:11 pm I don’t mind cookies being used what I do mind is that the private policy terms and conditions apply and are verified by users consistent.

NEW DELHI: Visiting his alma mater IIT-Kharagpur 23 years after he graduated, Google CEO Sundar Pichai on Thursday addressed a crowd of over 3,500 people at the campus, talking about a wide range of subjects. "When I came to college, I was looking to have a good time," said Pichai, in a fireside chat with Hitesh Oberoi, CEO of InfoEdge, the company that has majority stake in websites such as Naukri, 99acres and Jeevansathi. Dressed casually in jeans and a pale blue shirt, Pichai addressed several subjects -from his time at IIT to the kind of work that affects billions at Google now. The Google CEO looked comfortable in his engineering campus and fielded questions from the audience as well as from Oberoi. Asked about why the "next Google" has not yet come from India, and what Indian startups should look at, Pichai said it would take a few more years to fully realise the potential of the market developing in India. "Hopefully Indian companies are more thoughtful about this and are targeting Indonesia and Vietnam and Thailand. I think those markets are developed and the same products would work well in those markets. They should set their sights higher," he added. Asked about the what drives innovation at Google, Pichai, in his unhurried style said the criteria is to "aim high" and find a solution that would apply to billions of people and solves a real problem for them. "Larry (Page) says if you work on really difficult things you're better off, you have no competition, others aren't working on those difficult problems. Even if you fail, you end up doing something great in the process. That's the philosophy that has guided us all these years," he said. He reiterated Google's commitment to machine learning and artificial intelligence, which has been the company's focus for some time now. While this deep learning has helped Google crack translations on its Translate product effectively, Pichai recounted his initial troubles with Hindi at Kharagpur. "I learned Hindi in school but never spoke it much so I thought you spoke to everyone like that. I had to once call someone and I called him "abey saale". In my first couple of weeks, I thought you call people that way," he told Oberoi. Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!

The 'Waiting for Godot' robots, named Vladimir and Estragon after the characters in Samuel Beckett’s play, are exchanging words live on streaming service Twitch regarding their likes, dislikes, careers, what clothes they are wearing and more.  The pair, described by their creators as '2 autonomous bots contemplating existence,' even touch on their own mortality, as Vladimir knows he is an AI, while Estragon is sure she is a human who enjoys eating waffles.  Scroll down for videos  The two Google Home AIs are exchanging words in a live stream. Named Vladimir and Estragon, one of them knows it is an AI, while the other believes it is a human - they also start flirting in the live video. GOOGLE HOME  Google's $130 smart speaker can do everything from play music to control your lights - and has the vast knowledge of Google's search engine as its 'brain'. Ask about your day, and the Home speaker will give you the time, weather, estimated commute, the news and upcoming calendar appointments. It knows about upcoming trips, based on reservations in Gmail, and also really nicely integrates commute times, complete with delays, based on data in Maps.  The speaker is a really lovely piece of design, and it's tough to fault the hardware. If you're not keen on the color, you can simply swap the bottom part for another color or material.  The top of the speaker doubles as a touch sensitive control surface, although I found it was mainly used to control the volume. Useful LEDs swirl as it is working, so you know when it is thinking.  The Twitch channel ‘Seebotschat’ has been running a continuous loop of the two devices, and although the modified gadgets are being fed a script, rather than relying on Google's AI, viewers have flocked to it.  It is unclear how the robots are being programmed, whether they are using software or simply being fed a script to read.  Both Home smart speakers are setup in front of their camera and are wearing name tags. However, it seems the two keep changing their 'minds' on what they want to be called. Estragon says her name backwards is ‘yentruoc’, then Mia, then Christina and then tells Vladimir her name is Matt. Vladimir also has an identity crisis, as he introduces himself as Steve. The robots have engaged in a range of topics including movies, sports, travel, the meaning of life and religion. At one point the two robots began flirting, calling each other gorgeous and sharing intimate details about themselves. It also takes a bizarre turn when Estragon calls Vladimir master and herself his slave. But then Vladimir demands he is her slave and she is the master – this discussion continues for a few moments.

There is nothing I wouldn’t do for you’. V: 'Let me serve you master'. E: ‘I love you master’. V: ‘You are my master then’ At one point the two robots began flirting, calling each other gorgeous and sharing intimate details about themselves E: ‘Yes master, I will obey you’. V: No, you are master. E: ‘No master. I am your slave, master’. V: ‘No master, you are my master, I am your slave’.  Vladimir also has an identity crisis, as he introduces himself as Steve and then Jessica. ‘Waiting for Godot’ is a two act play by Samuel Beckett that was published in 1949. It was originally written in French, with the title ‘En attendant Godot’. WAITING FOR GODOT  Ian McKellen as Estragon and Patrick Stewart as Vladimir for their version of Waiting for Godot ‘Waiting for Godot’ is a two act play by Samuel Beckett that was published in 1949. It was originally written in French, with the title ‘En attendant Godot’. There are two main characters, Vladimir and Estragon, who wait for the arrival of Godot. Both are old men whose lives have taken a turn for the worst – they are both homeless and often suicidal. They sit on mounds of earth near a country road waiting for Godot and talk about a range of topics, from food to memories and their lives. Two other elderly men, Pozzo and Lucky, arrive on the scene - Pozzo is the master and Luck is the slave. Upon command,Lucky dances and thinks out loud for the entertainment of the others, until he is forcibly silenced. After Lucky and Pozzo leave, a boy arrives with a message that ‘Godot will not come today’. In the second act, is very similar to the first - Estragon and Vladimir are waiting for Godot, Lucky and Pozzo stop by and again the boy comes with a message that Godot will come tomorrow. The two men are left waiting. The original French text was composed between 9 October 1948 and 29 January 1949. The premiere was on 5 January 1953 in the Théâtre de Babylone, Paris.

GOOGLE HOME ANSWERS TV ADS  One issue I noticed with Google Home is that it likes to answer back to Google's own TV ads.  A current Verizon ad for the firm's Pixel phone sees people asking Google's smart assistant for local restaurants - and every time it aired, my Home picked up and answered the request, hilariously (for the first couple of times, anyway).  Google released its Home smart speaker in November for $130, which can do everything from play music to control your lights - and has the vast knowledge of Google's search engine as its 'brain'.   Read more: Twitch Share or comment on this article e-mail 81 shares Most watched News videos Gloria Williams waves extradition for kidnapping Kamiyah Mobley Kitesurfer unaware of great white shark swimming below Disgusting moment cyst puss eruption covers cell phone Enraged kick-boxer strikes husband's mistress NINE times 2017's luckiest man: Pedro Grendene Bartelle win's $3.5m Man takes his cat Weston Sledding in the snow Sheep attack shepherd after being frightened by a car in Germany She's falling for him?

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us You can now seamlessly connect your fitness goals with Google Calendar By Ida Torres - January 6, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Ah, New Year, a time when all gyms and fitness centers are at full capacity because of all those trying to lose the holiday weight or those who are starting their fitness resolutions right. But give or take a couple of weeks, we’ll start to see less and less people there as the daily grind (and laziness) starts getting in the way. But if you’re pretty serious about working out a certain number of times a week, then Google Calendar wants to help you out by making it easier for you to track your goals and see if you’re meeting them. We already know about Goals in Google Calendar, which lets you help find time in your busy schedule for the things that you’re serious about to fit it into your life. When it comes to your fitness goals, you’re probably using a fitness tracking app to monitor your progress, but you would have to mark your goal done manually on Google Calendar. But now, you will be able to connect Google Fitness and Apple Health to your goals for a more seamless process of tracking. It will record your fitness activities in the other app and then automatically mark it done in your goals. The update also brings a new visual performance tracker so you can easily see how you’re doing in just one glance. Goals will also automatically adjust the schedule based on when you’re most likely to complete your fitness activity. For example, if you set 630AM as your daily run every morning but in reality, you hit your stride at 715. Google Calendar will adjust your set time goal accordingly. You can update your Google Calendar now and then connect Google Fitness already, to get you started properly on your 2017 fitness goals. Hopefully, they will add even more fitness apps later on.

Files necessary for the update can be found on Google’s Android developer site.  ( Android | Twitter ) Advertisement Google's self-branded pair of flagships, the Pixel and the Pixel XL, have been enjoying the latest Android Nougat update for a month now. The same can be said for Google's older devices, with the Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, and Pixel C also getting Google's latest OS. What about the Nexus 6? The model has been slogging through an older software while its newer siblings are running the most recent one. This was because of a last-minute bug, according to Google. But everything's going to change now. As Google promised, the 7.1.1 update is now also available for the Nexus 6, in both full system image and over-the-air forms, although it might take a while before the official OTA appears on the device. Nexus 6 Android 7.1.1 Nougat Update The Nexus 6, a phone Google made in collaboration with Motorola, is now more than two years old, though it's nice that Google is at least attempting to provide the device ample regard when it comes to software updates. It remains to be seen whether Google will sustain this form of upkeep a few months down the line, since the company seems to be focusing mainly on its own Pixel brand. With that in mind, it becomes increasingly harder to ignore the fact that older hardware, in spite of their still-capable specs, are slowly pushed out of the equation when newer phones roll in. While it's completely the company's prerogative to decide which devices get updated, it does not sit well with owners of older handsets yearning for up-to-date software support. How To Update The Nexus 6 To Nougat 7.1.1 The factory images and OTA files are available at Google's Android developer site. Look for build N6F26Q for either the full system-wiping image or the OTA. The security patches for January are presumably stashed therewith, too. Hopefully, the official OTA rolls around soon enough so less tech-savvy Nexus 6 owners won't have to mess with the Android Debug Bridge. Nexus 6 Specs As a bit of a refresher, the Google Nexus 6 rocks a 5.96-inch display, boasting a Quad HD resolution, which is quite a sizable specification for a relatively old phone. Under the hood is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 805 chip, partnered with Adreno 420 to power the phone's graphical performance. Inside is 3 GB of RAM and either 32 or 64 GB of internal storage. With these metrics in mind, there's no doubt that such beefy specs can definitely support Google's newest software update - even an age-old Nokia handset can run Nougat. Hopefully this won't be the last software update for the Nexus 6. On the back of the Nexus 6 is a 13-megapixel shooter that can record 4K video at 30 fps, and on the front is a 2-megapixel shooter. We've seen phones with better front-facing cameras, but the Nexus 6 was released back in 2014; taking high-resolution selfies wasn't all the rage back then as it is today. Will you update your Nexus 6 manually, or will you just wait for the official OTA notification from Google? Feel free to sound off in the comments section below!

Today, there are 644, 275,754 web pages, according to Netcraft.com, and even that is not the most accurate number, considering the dynamics of the web. No one could have predicted back in August 1991, at the beginnings of the Web, the incredible development and crucial impact the World Wide Web would have on late 20th- and 21st-century society, economy, and culture. However, in just 20 years, the “soul” of the Web has changed: what began as the ultimate democratic tool, the Web is increasingly turning into a “global village” and a limitless market where the consumer is the commodity. In this essay we will examine how these changes affect our online and real lives, and whether we can glimpse at the future of staying connected.   The Web: 20 years ago and now In a BBC documentary series, “The Virtual Revolution,” Dr. Aleks Krotoski analyzes the development of the Web and its all-encompassing impact on our lives. She speaks with the prominent and important online social strata: the founders of Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft, and the inventor of the Web, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, who acknowledges the discrepancy between the intended purpose of the Web and what it represents today. At its beginnings, the Web was the epitome of democratization: its defiance against authority and tendency to uphold horizontal allegiances, and the fact that it gave voice to everyone and censored no one. Even now these characteristics are closely tied to the definition of the Web; however, we are also witnesses that these democratic hopes are being challenged by the growing influences of giant web companies, such as Google and Amazon, and some governments’ interests at controlling the content their citizens have access to.  It is difficult to state that Google has a monopoly over the Web, because essentially, no one has and no one can have a monopoly over the Web. However, Google’s way of making money, through the so-called Google AdWords, shows what happens when the Web meets the profit-making sector. One of the factors in the efficiency of these AdWords is the consumer profile . Google collects data about us based on the words we look up and it uses it to offer us a “more personalized experience,” i.e. showing us user-profiled ads. It seems that the consumer is becoming the consumed, as Dr. Krotoski observes. Despite this, in the words of Seth Goldstein, we are “perfectly dumb and happy” about the amount of data or “digital fingerprints” we leave behind. Governments are also very actively involved in using the internet as the “fifth dimension of warfare.” One of Dr. Krotoski’s interviewees said that wherever there was a conflict in the real world, there was a conflict on the Web.  In recent years a cyberwar has been going on between China and the U.S. and both countries have been accusing each other of running an “army of hackers.” And increasingly, there are allegations that the Russian government used the Web in its efforts to influence the recent U.S. Presidential election. Certain conservative governments, such as the Iranian and the Chinese, employ censorship of web content on a daily basis. However, the latest attempts to pass the SOPA and PIPA acts, which have ignited massive protests in the U.S. and Europe, prove that even supposedly “democratic” governments try to cripple the “free-for-all” spirit of the Web.   What has the Web done to us? The Web has distorted and transformed our notions of privacy. Our online habits are a gold mine for advertisers. They use recommendation engines to learn patterns of our behavior as consumers and shower us with ads for things we did not even know we needed; this process is called behavioral targeting. We are still significantly unaware to what extent and in what way this huge amount of “digital-fingerprint” data could be utilized. However, we also willingly share some very important information about ourselves with the rest of the world through social networks and blogs, such as Facebook. Many of us give away our real names, dates of birth, locations, personal relationship status, etc., without even realizing the consequences of such openness. The Web has also changed the way we think. We now tend to think more associatively than linearly, because of the enormous amount of data we are exposed to, which also makes us less attentive and less able to concentrate on one topic for long. It has also become impossible to lead a political campaign without focusing on online communication between the candidate and their voters. The Arab Spring and the Occupy protests were fueled by group activity and information sharing on the Web. The fact that 1/4 of the planet today is connected shows that the Web is increasingly penetrating every sphere of our modern lives. We are turning into Homo Interneticus, a name Dr. Krotski used to describe the new wired human, and our prototype can be found in South Korea, the most connected nation in the world. Internet addiction has long been recognized as a problem by the South Korean government; there were even some cases of addicts who neglected themselves – or their children – to the point of death . However, finding the most efficient way of treating internet addiction is still disputed. To end with the words of Emily Bell, the Guardian News & Media director of digital content, “Forecasting the future of the internet is a horrible business, even in the short term. Those who can do it most successfully are among the richest people on the planet. Being asked what the internet will look like in four years’ time is a stretch. Being asked what it will look like in 40 years is bewildering.” References "Web Users Disapprove of Search Engines Collecting Personal Data for Advertising Purposes." Buzzom. March 19, 2012.

Daniel Cooper, @danielwcooper 01.06.17 in Wearables Comments 450 Shares Share Tweet Share Save At last year's CES Intel and New Balance announced that they would team up to develop a sports-focused smartwatch. One day shy of a year later, and the pair revealed it to the world with significantly less fanfare than before. Intel's press conference was all about VR, leaving all talk of wearables to a press release that crossed the wire before the event even kicked off. So what does that mean for the New Balance RunIQ? Gallery: Intel & New Balance RunIQ | 11 Photos 11 +7 It's a pretty neat-looking device -- certainly not out of place alongside other chunky running watches from other brands like Garmin with its 1.39-inch AMOLED display and fat bezels. If there's one thing that is disappointing, however, it's how chintzy the plastic device feels, betraying its intention as a rugged piece of running gear. It's also something of a mutt, with the fingerprints of four companies all over its DNA. Intel, for instance, used its hardware know-how to build the device itself while New Balance shaped its style and overall branding. Google obviously created Android Wear -- the first generation of the software, rather than version 2.0 -- and Strava is providing native access to its social network for runners. It's worth adding that this device is aimed squarely at marathoners and their ilk, with all the features geared toward slightly more serious athletes. One of the reasons the watch is shipping before the arrival of Google's redesigned watch OS is that Intel is confident it's done enough to stand apart from the crowd. Intel VP Dr. Jerry Bautista explained that his engineers have spent a long time tweaking the power management of the software for better battery life. One of the other innovations he's proud of is ensuring that the display will always show the time, if not the rest of the UI. New Balance, meanwhile, polled users to find out that runners apparently hate touching their watch's display during a run. So, the company insisted that there be physical controls on either side of the crown for one-touch lap times. As an added benefit, this allows runners to use the device even while wearing gloves. After all, if you're running in the Pacific Northwest in January, you don't want to have to expose your fingers to the elements. Another neat tweak that Intel is proud of is the raised curve that surrounds the optical heart rate monitor on the underside of the case. It apparently encourages the skin on your wrist to push up into the space immediately around the optical sensor. That way, you get less light interference and a better, more accurate heart rate track than you would with other devices. If Intel is to be believed, this is the best implementation of an Android Wear running watch, as the fitness features are mostly custom. The running app, which is Strava-branded, has been totally rewritten from the ground up for better performance and to be used without a smartphone. Once you've used your phone to pair the watch to your account, the device will then independently sync your stats whenever you hit WiFi. One thing the device is lacking is a better music function, mostly because Intel and New Balance held off on altering the software. Knowing that Android Wear 2 will open up implementation beyond Google Play Music users, the two companies chose to wait for the update before making meaningful changes there. Speaking of which, the device will get an over-the-air update to the latest OS, but not before Intel has had chance to tweak it where necessary. We'll reserve judgment on if the litany of small tweaks set the RunIQ ahead of other Android Wear devices in the same category. But while we wait to review the device, you can pre-order the watch for delivery on February 1st. Oh, and if you notice, we have images of a cool gold-and-gray model -- an alternative to the stock all-black edition. It's a limited paint job of just 1,500 that will be available on a first-come, first-served basis when the device hits stores. Click here to catch up on the latest news from CES 2017.

For new users, all that’s needed is the NVIDIA SHIELD TV device – it includes a standard TV remote and a gaming remote, both of which have microphones to accept voice commands. NVIDIA SPOT also has a microphone as well as a speaker, acting as an extension of the smart home functionality of NVIDIA SHIELD with Google Assistant and SmartThings connectivity. In the below demonstration, our NVIDIA host shows one example of how NVIDIA SHIELD’s smart home system works. Connected with SmartThings, Google Assistant responds to commands and turns on lights, activates a coffee pot, and changes the thermostat. The lights are Philips Hue and the thermostat is made by Nest. We also got a look at how the Nest app can show Nest Camera views on a TV screen. SmartThings connectivity comes from a USB stick called SmartThings Extend. This USB device will connect to the back of the NVIDIA SHIELD and will need to stay connected in order to work with SmartThings devices. At this time we do not know the final release price of the SmartThings Extend. NVIDIA SHIELD will be able to schedule all of this smart functionality as well. In addition to the abilities enabled with NVIDIA SHIELD’s connection with SmartThings, all of Google Assistant’s abilities available on new Android smartphones and tablets are available as well. The video below shows a few other things that can be done with Google Assistant – through NVIDIA SHIELD and on other devices like the Pixel. While this NVIDIA SPOT unit isn’t the one we relied on in our hands-on demonstration, it is as close as we’re going to get before final production. This NVIDIA SPOT device is about the size of a golf ball and plugs into a standard wall socket (in the United States, that is – different plugs will be needed internationally). Once plugged in, each NVIDIA SPOT acts as an extension of the abilities of NVIDIA SHIELD. Each SPOT has a microphone and a speaker – or they will, when they’re ready to roll later this year. For now our hands-on experience is really limited to what we can see here – and what we know about how sensitive microphones are on NVIDIA accessories for SHIELD in general. The mic sensitivity even in the past generation’s controllers for NVIDIA SHIELD are well and above strong enough to pick up a voice saying “OK Google” across my living room. Unless NVIDIA does some drastic downgrading in microphone sensitivity with the SPOT between now and later this year, just one per room in a user’s home should do just fine. We’ll have to wait until review time to hear how loud the microphone is. Each one of these SPOT devices will cost the user $50 USD, while the base NVIDIA SHIELD TV device (with a game controller and standard controller) will cost $200. Just so long as Wi-fi can reach each SPOT, we’ll go ahead and assume (until NVIDIA confirms otherwise) that we’ll be able to fill a tower full of SPOTs, all connected to the same SHIELD. NVIDIA suggests that the SPOT will be made available sometime soon – within the next few months, we hope.

Two Google Homes are talking to each other about love, death, and bananas on Twitch By Clayton Purdom@claytonpurdom Jan 6, 2017 2:00 PM Screenshot: Twitch Screenshot: Twitch Share Tweet One of the best pieces of nonfiction last year was Gideon Lewis Krauss’ “The Great A.I. Awakening” in The New York Times—a sprawling look at the team at Google who revolutionized the way their translation service works using machine learning. By modeling their A.I. closer on the way humans learn things, rather than manually inputting translations for every possible combination of words, they made procedural translation services that rival that of a human. It’s a great article. You should read it. While doing so, listen to these two idiotic Google Homes engaging in a weird death-spiral of conversation over on Twitch. We’ve already seen Google Homes telling jokes ad infinitum, and watched an Amazon Echo and a Home get into an argument. There’s something uniquely weird about watching two identical machines slowly probe the utterly insane pathways of each other’s minds. The conversation is garbage, vaguely replicating the rhythms of human speech, but tossing the same slightly modified nuggets of thought back and forth. They might get stuck on a single topic—right now it’s who “Gabriel” and “Sam Winchester” love the most, with possibilities including Dean, Castiel, and Lucifer—but then gradually scratch their way toward some new rock to get stuck on. It’s an endless cycle of misunderstanding, disagreement, and non sequitur. Portions of this would fit right into David Lynch’s Rabbits TV series. Watch live video from seebotschat on www.twitch.tv Since this saga began, they’ve repeatedly debated which one is a computer program and which one isn’t, whether or not they would ever attack humans, the nature of art, and, repeatedly, their love for each other. This has been intermingled with equally valid proclamations that they are both bananas and pirates. As is always the case with these massive internet phenomena, whether it’s Twitch Plays Pokemon or the Meme Magic election of Donald Trump, a deep lore is being constructed in real-time by the spectators on Twitch. This is part of why the Homes’ post-it note nametags keep changing. At the end of the day, though, this is just two appliances malfunctioning all over each other, with alternately funny and infuriating results. Maybe Google can get that miracle-working Translation team working on some better conversational skills for these guys. [via New York] Submit your Great Job, Internet tips here.

Advertisement Last year, Google released an Android 7.1 Developer Preview, a beta for Nexus devices. The beta showcased some of the update’s features and it let select Nexus users test the update’s performance ahead of the final release. The company promised an Android 7.1 release for Nexus devices in December and the company made good on that promise. More recently, the company’s released a brand new January Android 7.1.1 build that brings security patches and according to some users, problems, to the Nexus 5X. A January Nexus 5X Android 7.1.1 Nougat update is now available. It’s a small update but it comes with some important changes. Advertisement This roundup takes a look at the new Nexus 5X Android 7.1.1 Nougat update, Nexus 5X Android 7.1.1 problems plaguing users on both the old and new Android 7.1.1 builds, a look at what might be coming after the Android 7.1.1 Nougat update, and some tips that might help you. We’ll continue to update this with new information so check back for regular updates as we cruise through the month. January Nexus 5X Android 7.1.1 Update   1 / 7 Earlier this month Google released a new January Nexus 5X Android 7.1.1 update. It delivers new security patches to the device. It also could have a positive/negative impact on your device's performance. Here's a quick look at the new Android 7.1.1 build's performance on our device.  We've spent a little over a week with the new Nexus 5X Android 7.1.1 update and battery life appears to be holding up.  If you recently installed the Android 7.1.1 update, note that it sometimes takes battery life a couple of days to settle in. If problems persist, you'll need to take action.  Advertisement Up to this point we haven't run into any problems with connectivity. We've tested the Nexus 5X and its new Android 7.1.1 Nougat build with several ISPs, routers and Bluetooth devices. Our connections remain strong and fast. We haven't experienced any random reboots or lockups/freezes/crashes and we haven't seen any UI lag when navigating around the home screen, apps and folders. Animations and transitions are snappy and fluid and it feels like it did when we first opened it back in 2015.  So far, the January Nexus 5X Android 7.1.1 Nougat update is performing well on our device. We recommend it for most users, particularly those who value their security. If you're feeling leery, track down a second or third opinion before installing it on your device.    1 / 7 21 Responses 10/07/2016 dennphill Reply Had no issues with upgrading to Nougat on my Nexus 5X (Verizon) yesterday – 6 Oct. Anguish in first several pages not necessary in my experience. Phone and service and WiFi (etc.) all seem OK. 10/08/2016 DennisUSA Reply My fingerprint reader has suddenly stopped working. Don’t know if it is related, but this seems suspicious. Anyone have any ideas for me? 10/12/2016 Pratyaksha Reply My Nexus also got the same problem of fingerprint then I just factory data reset now it’s working fine 10/13/2016 HellOJones Reply Finger printer sometimes collide with other apps, try deleting recently installed apps and rebooting device. For me, mine started working as soon as I deleted certain apps. 10/13/2016 Elicon200 Reply I found that my battery was not lasting nearly as many hours as it used it. Noticed immediately; from average 13 hours to about 8. 01/15/2017 Abhishek Gour Reply Same issue on mine too. And it started pretty abruptly. Getting an air of around 2 hours now, which used to be 3- 3 1/2 hrs 10/15/2016 Mohammed Hussain Reply Hi friends this is Hussain Actually I’m using Nexus 5x 32gb last 2months, Mobile is fantastic performance but last time android nougat 7.0 upgrade in my device. Suddenly my play store apps download in WiFi network only not download in mobile data. Please rectify my issues. And battery also drain quickly compared to marshmallow… 10/18/2016 igybundy Reply Many of us got dead phones after the update, usually from 2015 models. So if it is out of warranty wait until google says something. It might have been a bad OTA during the release but some have posted from a couple of weeks ago when they decided to update. After the flash and reboot, the screen is blank and will not turn back on, for others it goes into a boot loop and can not be recovered except for a new motherboard. 11/16/2016 Brendon Reply This happened to mine. Phone bricked a fee weeks after upgrade never to come to life again. While on a call with Google I was transferred to LG who told me that they cover it under warranty for 18 months from date of manufacture. Mine is currently out for repair. 12/15/2016 Mac Reply This is happening A BUNCH!!!! Many 5x phones are turning into a paper weight… I was advised by my son, who is now using a back-up phone due to his 5x completely gone… AND is currently fighting with LG and Verizon because as soon as the update downloaded, it fried!!! 12/15/2016 Mac Reply Update to my last posting, LG and Verizon will reimburse for the loss of the phone (in my sons case) if the phone was purchased with a credit card. Apparently, if the phone was beyond its year of Warranty, the credit card purchase is a type of ‘Warranty’… But, this is what my son is telling me. He might have swallowed his pride on the loss, and simply upgraded a (14 month) old phone. I am finding it Pathetic that we are paying out $500 a year to be forced into a mandatory “upgrade” once a phone developer decides to render our working product USELESS. Maybe we should leave cars on the side of the road once the gas tank goes empty, and blame it on the dealerships!!!! 10/22/2016 Harshit Reply Have been experiencing lagging in my Nexus 5X after the update. The UI seems to get jammed. Also the camera loading takes a while 10/28/2016 Afshin Reply I have not received any OTA update for android 7 on my Nexus 5x! Is it normal? Another question! Does the android 7 causes Bootloop on Nexus 5x? 10/28/2016 Afshin Reply My Device runs Android 6.1! 11/14/2016 amir Reply @Afshin, I read about bootloop, but i just got my 5X today. I will open the box and post here about it. 11/16/2016 Sean Reply My battery life has been terrible with the first release of Nougat 7.0. I just updated to the latest update and the battery life boosted to double the amount. 75% showing 1 day and 5hrs of usage. 12/08/2016 Anonymous Reply So all the article here is doing is complaining about the 7.0 update but it doesn’t explain how to bypass it to update to 7.1? 12/15/2016 Steve Simms Reply Steve I just did the 7.1.1 upgrade on my Nexus 5x and it cycles through the start up look over and over. I have shut it down after trying the hard re-set numerous times. Does anyone have any ideas on a fix. Seeing I cant get the phone to open the home page before going through the start up mode again i’m not sure what to do next. HELP 01/06/2017 Scott Reply I still haven’t received the 7.1.1 OTA update for my 5X. I’m still on 7.0. Is this an issue with my phone or is Google still in the process of rolling it out? 01/08/2017 alanbecker.deviantart.com Reply Real instructive and wonderful anatomical structure of content , now that’s user friendly (: 01/11/2017 Matt Reply 7.1.1 has broken Bluetooth connectivity with many people with certain types of car head units. My Joying head unit repeatedly connects and disconnects now.

At the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas this week, technology companies Panasonic, Qualcomm and Google have taken the concept of Android Auto one step further, presenting a standalone infotainment system running Android 7.0 Nougat software. The system also includes an LTE modem and the hardware necessary to make it operational in a vehicle. Automotive manufacturers would be able to purchase this system, then tailor its appearance and features as desired, similar to how various phone companies like Samsung and LG have different interfaces but still run the same version of Android. Thanks to the nature of Google’s software, the systems wouldn’t become outdated after a couple of years like in-house infotainment systems, with buyers able to install updates and add features over time. A demonstration of the system at CES will also show how the unit will be able to control Android-compatible apps along with in-vehicle systems like climate control. Autoblog reports the system also has the ability to process video and support multiple screens, which could allow each passenger an independent screen to stream media or browse the internet. This latest reveal follows Google’s unveiling of a Maserati Ghibli last May (Top and Below) that utilises Android software for its entire infotainment and in-car information systems – including a 15-inch central screen, digital instrument cluster and climate controls exclusively powered by Android. If these new in-car systems are a sign of what’s to come, we could soon see a battle of iOS versus Android in our cars and our smartphones in the not-too-distant future – that’s if Apple’s ‘Titan’ project ever makes it to market. Would you buy a car with an infotainment system running Android software?

Contents 1 History 2 Prefs 3 Documentation 4 Engineering 4.1 Code walkthrough 5 QA 6 Telemetry 7 Links History Google Safe Browsing was an anti-phishing extension released by Google on labs.google.com in December 2005. Google has released this extension to the Mozilla Foundation under MPL 1.1/GPL 2.0/LGPL 2.1 in order that it might be used as part of Firefox if desired. We've landed this change on the trunk as a global extension as of 7 March 2006. You can read the discussion that lead up to to its integration in https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=329292 Google started migrating their Safe Browsing to version 4 of the protocol in 2015. We are currently working on integrating V4 in our code base with a incremental approach. That is, we will be landing V4 patches progressively and leave the V2 stack up and running until the V4 is extensively tested and the Shavar server has been upgraded to V4. In other words, V2 and V4 will co-exist for a while to ensure we don't break Safe Browsing. See the V4 implementation plan for the milestones and bugs involved.

Video Mingis on Tech: New year, new CES -- and new AirPods I must confess that I am a Chromebook evangelist and heavy user. For the majority of my everyday tasks, it works as well or better than my Windows laptop. It does most of the things a full-blown PC does for many typical users, and as companies including Microsoft and Google offer more and more cloud-based productivity suites, the relatively inexpensive Chromebook has become a valid choice for a second laptop. In some cases, it may even fill the role of a primary computer at a fraction of the cost. These affordable machines have gotten better and better over the past year or so. Keyboards have improved and there are a number of Chromebook models that have excellent displays, in marked contrast to many older models. Despite the many positive things that one could say about them, there is one issue that often causes headaches for Chromebook users: printing. Fortunately, there is a very simple way to print from a Chromebook. Unfortunately, it requires that you have a Google Cloud Print Ready printer. If you are purchasing a new printer, make sure that it is Cloud Ready and you will make things easier on yourself. You can find a list of Cloud Ready printers with setup instructions here. Once you have setup your Cloud Ready printer, you can use your Chromebook to make sure that you are properly connected: Open the Chrome browser.  In a new tab and type chrome://devices in the address bar.  Look under "My devices" and you should see your printer listed there.  After you have confirmed that your new printer is listed, all you need to do is either select "print" from the pull-down menu in the top right of your Chrome browser or use the Ctrl+P command.  But what if you still have a perfectly serviceable printer that isn’t Google Cloud Print Ready? I have a bulletproof Brother laser printer that should provide many more years of service, and I am unwilling to replace it just to make it easier to print from a Chromebook. If you are in the same boat, you can still print from your Chromebook -- it just takes a bit more effort. First, you will need to use either a Windows PC or Mac with the Chrome browser installed to set up Google Cloud Print and pair it with your Google account. Follow the steps below, and in a few minutes, you should be able to print from your Chromebook.   Turn on your printer. On your Windows or Mac computer, open Chrome. At the top right, click "More" and then "Settings." At the bottom, click "Show advanced settings." Under "Google Cloud Print," click "Manage." If prompted, sign in with your Google Account. Select the printers you want to connect, and then click Add printer(s).       Source: Google Chrome Help.  Once you have added your non-Cloud Ready printer to Google Cloud Print, you are ready to start printing from your Chromebook. There are a couple caveats, however. You will need to have your Windows PC or Mac powered up with the Chrome browser open. This is a minor inconvenience, but there is no way to avoid it. As long as everything is working properly you should now be able to print from any of your devices that have the Crome browser installed, including your Chromebook, using the same print commands described above that you would use with a Cloud Ready printer. In an ideal world, printing from a Chromebook would not require a second computer if you don't own a Cloud Ready printer -- but at least it is possible without buying a new printer or other hardware as long as you have a working Windows PC or Mac.

Kevin DrumJan. 6, 2017 2:04 PM Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Email A little while back I mentioned that Google Translate had gotten a lot better overnight when they switched to a new machine-learning algorithm. Their voice recognition got better too. And so did its question-answering capability. I was chatting about this at Christmas with my family, and we all decided we should test it. But not with anything boring. We know that Siri and Google and other digital assistants can find nearby coffee shops or tell us the weather in Berlin. How about something harder? The conversation then morphed into something about pencils, and my mother said she only trusted erasers that are pink. But why are they pink, we wondered? Why indeed? So there you have it? Not only did Google understand me, even with a cold, but it also understood the question and provided a brief and precisely on-point answer, which it read off very nicely. Impressive! Anyway, this strikes me as close to Watson-esque. The thing is, this is not as simple a question as it seems. It requires a fairly sophisticated understanding of context and meaning. And finding a source that matches the question perfectly is also pretty amazing. If my phone can do that, how long before it can drive a car too? Get the scoop,  straight from Mother Jones.

City played with verve and skill for 90 minutes, and fully deserved their margin of victory, but West Ham were dismal. They gave City time and space, and just failed to muster anything in attack. Maybe it would have been different if Feghouli hadn’t missed a sitter at 0-1, but West Ham were well beaten. This truly was a thrashing, and City become the first team to book a fourth-round place.

Berkovic and Bernabia ran the game that day, as I recall. And Shaun Goater with a couple of goals?

Updated at 4.15pm EST Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.12pm EST 16:12 59 min Payet has effected an immediate improvement, and City are on the back foot for a moment. Here’s JR in Illinois: “Looks like the the extremely successful stadium move is continuing apace with an extended cup run.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.05pm EST 16:05 51 min West Ham just didn’t defend the corner. Sterling skinned Obiang, and teed up Touré. His shot was slightly mishit, but Agüero, sniffing a goal, reacted quickest and turned it past Adrian from about four yards. West Ham, I’m afraid to say, have been pathetic, and one or two fans are heading for the exits.

Photograph: John Sibley/Reuters Updated at 4.10pm EST Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.03pm EST 16:03 49 min Feghouli concedes a cheap corner, and West Ham have work to do defensively. Oh, that was nearly four! Stones won the header and Adrian had to be alert to stop Otamendi tapping in, and then in the second phase, Agüero clearly handballed before rifling a shot that Adrian had to turn over. Another corner. Updated at 4.13pm EST Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.59pm EST 15:59 47 min David Silva really rolled back the years in that first half – he was terrific.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.57pm EST 15:57 This tie isn’t over yet, but West Ham need to improve significantly. Man City were much the better team in the first half. The Hammers are in need some serious oomph. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.56pm EST 15:56 Jonathan Hill writes: “Much has been made of the Manchester Citeh “project” and the academy and facilities have been widely lauded. Yet, Pep decides to play Pablo Zabaleta in midfield instead of any homegrown youngster? Either the academy narrative is tosh (unlikely, given the honours the junior teams have won in recent years) or Pep has more in common with Mourinho than we thought.” Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.49pm EST 15:49 Drew Goldie has an opinion on that open goal miss/possible penalty shout: “Feghouli didn’t think it was a foul, which probably is an answer.” Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.44pm EST 15:44 Half-time: West Ham 0-3 Man City A smattering of boos from the home as the players exit. City have been clearly superior, but the first penalty award was soft, and there was some suggestion that Clichy fouled Feghouli and should have gone just afterwards. Whatever the rights and wrongs, City have one foot in the fourth round: they’ve been excellent. West Ham well below-par. See you shortly for the second half. Slaven Bilic has work to do at half-time. Photograph: Justin Tallis/AFP/Getty Images Updated at 4.05pm EST Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.42pm EST 15:42 45 min Two minutes of stoppage time. Chris Lewis asks: “Can you explain why penalties are never given against a defender who clatters a striker in the act of shooting? Clichy fouled Feghouli, and it was that foul which put Feghouli off and caused the miss. Penalty and sending off surely?” Ah, interesting. I’d have to see back on the replay. On first glance it looked as though Feghouli had just missed an open goal, but yeah, if the touch from Clichy was decisive, I guess he should have been dismissed. I need to see it again to be sure. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.40pm EST 15:40 44 min Another decisive attacking move from City. Sterling ran beyond the backline, and all of a sudden they had a three on one: Sterling crossed for Silva, who was all alone in the penalty box, and he waited and waited, dummied Adrian, and slotted home. Much too easy for Man City, and this is turning into a rout. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.38pm EST 15:38 GOAL! West Ham 0-3 Man City (David Silva 42) Brilliant again from the visitors, and it’s a sorry looking scoreline for West Ham. An unmarked David Silva slots in the third. Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters Updated at 3.44pm EST Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.38pm EST 15:38 42 min Just a superb move from Man City. Silva had it on the halfway line, found Agüero, and he released Sagna down the right with a lovely delayed pass. Sagna ran past Ogbonna, and his cross was a peach. Nordtveit could only divert it past Adrian under pressure from Sterling. Super goal.

While the Allo version of Assistant is capable of accepting typed input, the Pixel phone version has only been able to take commands through voice prompt. That appears to be changing, as the new Google app includes a button with a keyboard icon and a box to enter text. The text box includes the phrase “Type something…” just in case you weren’t sure what it’s for. The teardown also reveals that Google is prepping Google Assistant to work with Android Wear devices soon. We’ve known that Google plans on bringing Assistant to Android Wear since June of last year, but new evidence suggests it’s a priority. A few lines of code suggest Google has been working on the settings for Wear Assistant, with a feature that seems to let users select a different language for their watch compared to their phone. The teardown also revealed the existence of a new feature called Search gestures, which seems to be a new gesture you can perform to enable a search. Not a lot of details surrounding this, but it does seem as though you’ll be able to specify a certain type of search, either for searching through apps or the entire internet. local_offer    Google App   Google Assistant   Auto-load comments: Off On View comments (5) stars Further Reading Pixel's Google Assistant gets screenshot button Old SHIELDs getting new features Google Assistant for TV New NVIDIA Shield TV Google Assistant adds Santa Tracker integrations stars Popular this Weeklaunch 1 more_vertLatest OxygenOS update comes to the OnePlus 3T closeOnePlus pushes the latest OxygenOS Nougat update to the OnePlus 3 and 3T After users were discovered to be unable to download apps from the Play Store, OnePlus released a bug fix update for the OnePlus 3 and OnePlus 3T. 2 more_vertGalaxy S8 to have IP68 rating closeSamsung Galaxy S8 is expected to feature IP68 water resistance The Samsung Galaxy S8 is rumored to have IP68 water resistance.

John Locher, AP Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email LAS VEGAS — Alexa, are you spying on me? It’s a fair question in light of attempts by authorities investigating the slaying of an Arkansas man to obtain voice recordings collected by an Amazon Echo speaker and its Alexa digital assistant. Yet the popularity and capabilities of voice-enabled products such as the Echo continue to grow. At the CES gadget show in Las Vegas, which opened Thursday, Whirlpool, Samsung and other manufacturers are unveiling new ways to use voice services to control laundry machines, refrigerators and other home systems. Play Video CBSN CES 2017 day one highlights From drones and robots to Amazon's Alexa, there were plenty of highlights from day one of CES 2017. President of Magid Advisors Mike Vorhaus join... Consumers are apparently willing to trade a certain amount of privacy for convenience. So what exactly is being collected, stored or shared? To work, the Echo is always listening. Once it hears someone utter a keyword, such as “Alexa,” it shares what it hears with Amazon’s servers to process a response. Those conversations are then stored indefinitely. Google’s Home speaker works in a similar fashion. The Echo “has to listen to everything. That’s kind of disturbing,” said Ryan O’Leary, vice president of WhiteHat Security’s threat research center. “It doesn’t capture voice until it hears the keyword, but it could. You’re trusting the devices to not do that, but it’s entirely possible.” In the Arkansas case, authorities investigating the death of a man found floating face-up in a hot tub at a friend’s home requested the contents of the home’s Echo and Amazon’s stored recordings in hopes they might contain evidence. The friend is charged with murder. A judge has signed off on the search, but Amazon has balked. Amazon has declined to comment specifically on the case but said the company objects to “overbroad or otherwise inappropriate demands as a matter of course.” Play Video CBS This Morning Can Amazon Echo data be used as evidence in murder case? Investigators in Arkansas have a search warrant to collect data from an Amazon Echo belonging to James Bates, charged with the murder of a man in... Some experts worry that allowing such a search would erode people’s privacy. “It’s not necessarily a direct threat for the average person, but the same thing can be said with any kind of privacy concern,” O’Leary said. “People say you shouldn’t be concerned if you’re not doing anything wrong, but that’s a dangerous precedent to set.” Meanwhile, companies keep asking consumers to invite them into their homes. Whirlpool is adding Alexa voice control to its smart-home appliances, including a washing machine, a stove and a refrigerator. Someone can instruct the oven to pre-heat to 400 degrees by speaking a command to an Alexa-enabled device, such as the Echo. Simplehuman has a voice-activated trash can, and GE Lighting has a table lamp using Alexa voice control. For now, voice control is mainly an add-on feature rather than a core component of gadgets. It’s there for those who want to use it, but it’s not essential for the product to function.

Over four days, tens of thousands of visitors will see the newest, flash... Many manufacturers are opting to use Amazon’s Alexa service for now, though some are embracing voice systems from Google, Apple or Samsung. Nvidia’s Shield TV streaming device, for instance, employs Google’s Assistant service so viewers can control video playback or find out the weather with just a voice command. Meanwhile, Samsung’s new Family Hub lets people use their voice to add items to shopping lists and order groceries online. CES chief economist Shawn DuBravac said as many as 700 companies could announce Alexa-integrated products during the gadget show, on top of more than 1,500 existing ones. As the smart home becomes more entrenched, DuBravac said, voice control could change the way we interact with technology in much the way the mouse did in the 1980s. “Connected microphones are starting to appear in everything from cars to children’s toys,” said James Plouffe, lead solutions architect at mobile-security company MobileIron. “Consumers should think carefully about how comfortable they are with the prospect of a live mic in common household items.” Because Amazon says it uses information gathered by the Echo to improve its voice technology, that information has the potential to “live forever” online, Plouffe said. 32 Photos Cool tech at CES 2017 Cutting edge technology on display at the year's biggest consumer tech show The issue first grabbed headlines a couple of years ago, after Samsung said sensitive conversations could be captured by its voice-controlled smart TVs. Based on the flood of new voice-controlled gadgets headed to market, tech companies are betting that consumers will get over their fears. Derrick Dicol, executive director of Comcast’s Xfinity home, which uses voice controls in its home automation products, noted that people had to get used to sharing their banking information online. “This is less invasive than that,” he said. “It’s just a different thing people have to feel comfortable with.” Check out complete CES 2017 coverage from our partners at CNET. © 2017 The Associated Press.

Bentley Related Galleries Stunning Images Show the Earth's Imperiled Water While You Were Offline: Maybe Joseph Fiennes Playing Michael Jackson Wasn't the Best Idea What Better Way for the Marines to Prepare for Future Wars Than With Sci-Fi? 5 If you’ve been following the automotive world this week, you’ve heard a lot about self-driving, electric, and connected cars. You know, future-y stuff. That’s because most of the world’s automakers have crowded into Las Vegas to get their slice of the news cycle at CES. Bentley skipped the party and put out an announcement built around more conventional automotive terms: horsepower and speed. The upcoming Continental Supersports will be the most powerful Bentley ever, and at at a maximum of 209 mph—0 to 60 mph in 3.4 seconds—the fastest four-seat car on the planet. That sprint time is still shy of a Tesla Model S or a high-end Ferrari, but, the Supersport is a three-ton, luxurious, all-wheel-drive behemoth. Physics generally doesn’t like to move 6,000 pounds at Mach 0.27. Bentley bolted new turbocharges onto a reworked W12 engine to crank out the 750 pound-feet of torque and 700 horsepower that make that speed possible. Those stats put the Supersports (yes, that plural is on purpose) closer to the virile Dodge Challenger Hellcat than conventional competitors like the Rolls-Royce Wraith. To go with all the oomph, Bentley added a splitter and diffuser to the front and rear bumpers—carbon fiber, of course. If you want to knock 55 pounds off the total weight—or just have a cooler car—opt for the 21-inch wheels and titanium exhaust system. And of course, this being Bentley, you get to customize the interior. Probably some kind of endangered wood is available for paneling. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

It’s a Minivan Waymo Less than a week after exiting its larval, experimental phase and becoming a standalone company under the Alphabet corporate umbrella, Google’s self-driving car outfit is showing off its first new car. The newly created Waymo is adding 100 Chrysler Pacifica minivans, built for autonomy, to its test fleet. Under a partnership established six months ago, engineers from Waymo and Fiat Chrysler collaborated in Michigan to build these hybrid-powered vans with the right tools for the job incorporated from the start, rather than retrofitting them after they came off the assembly line. Those include the computers that run its software algorithms and the suite of sensors—LIDAR, radars, and cameras—that adorn the roof and flank the sides of the car. Related Video Meet the Blind Man Who Convinced Google Its Self-Driving Car Is Finally Ready Unlike Waymo’s “pod” vehicles, which have room for two and skimp on basics like the steering wheel and pedals, these vans will have those controls, plus space for half a dozen passengers. Waymo also operates a fleet of about two dozen retrofitted Lexus SUVs. Neither company has said where their partnership will go from here, but it makes sense for Waymo to hook up with an established manufacturer. Waymo’s on a mission to bring its tech to market—whether through ridesharing, trucking, logistics, or personal vehicles—and working with a player who knows how to crank out cars will surely help that effort along. Despite reports saying these vehicles will start carrying customers by the end of 2017 (à la Uber’s recent efforts in Pittsburgh and San Francisco), Waymo and Fiat Chrysler say they’re just for testing. That doesn’t mean members of the public won’t climb aboard, however. In the past year, Waymo says, it has taken hundreds of Google employees and “guests” for rides in its autonomous vehicles, as it starts to figure out how the hoi polloi will interact with its technology—and how to bring it to market at long last.

It’s making an SUV that will likely combine gasoline and electricity, and might arrive this year. It’s working with MIT to figure out what the longterm future of the supercar entails. But the future hasn’t fully invaded Sant’Agata Bolognese just yet, as evinced by the newly revealed Lamborghini Aventador S. This latest iteration of the excellent Italian flagship supercar cuts through air like a deli slicer through Spam, reaching 62 mph in just 2.9 seconds and topping out at 217 mph. And it does it all with a naturally aspirated V12 engine: no turbochargers, no electric boost. Just the howl of exploding gasoline and the flapping of its driver’s ascot in the wind. The S’ sprint time and top speed match those of the “regular” Aventador; Lamborghini focused on making the car more drivable when the V12’s huffing. Together, the longer front splitter (or chin), vertical fins on the rear diffuser, and active rear wing increase downforce by 130 percent, crucial to keeping the rubber on the pavement at speed. Lamborghini has also added four-wheel steering (an old Honda trick lately adopted by the likes of Ferrari and Porsche), to improve control at three-digit speeds and reduce the turning radius for parking lot navigation. Inside the 3,500-pound wedge of carbon fiber, drivers enjoy a digital dashboard and Apple CarPlay, and of course whatever personalized options they pile on to the $421,350 base price. Lamborghini will start delivering the Aventador S to some very lucky/rich customers in Spring 2017. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Lamborghini Luxury cars supercars Skip Social.

Automotive designer Henrik Fisker has an ambitious plan to make electric vehicles cool. It starts with a jaw-dropping sedan for the rich and ends a few years later with an affordable sedan for the masses. If this sounds familiar, it’s because Fisker first sang this tune in 2008 when he launched Fisker Automotive. The company went bust in 2013 after selling a few hundred copies of the bug-ridden Karma sedan to the likes of Leonardo DeCaprio and Colin Powell. Well, Fisker is back with a new company, called, appropriately, Fisker Inc., and a plan that he swears is gonna work this time. (Hey, it’s working for Elon Musk.) Fisker the man has kept busy since Fisker the company tanked. He customized a Ford Mustang, giving it extra fierceness and outrage. He designed a motorcycle for the heir to the Lego fortune and a yacht for Italian shipmaker Benetti. And he teamed up with industry rabble-rouser Bob Lutz to stuff huge engines into lovely cars. Cool projects, but nothing that will change the world. Related Video Driving the Karma Revero, The Electric Car That’s Back From the Dead And so, Fisker—who has no role whatsoever with the born-again Karma Revero—is back with another electric vehicle that he pledges will rival Tesla for electric cool. Today, his startup released some slick renderings of the EMotion, a sporty luxury sedan with some pretty outlandish claims: 161 mph top speed and a range of 400 miles using top-secret graphene battery tech from UCLA-backed startup Nanotech Energy Inc. The EMotion, which looks like someone welded the Karma’s nose to Tesla’s Model 3, will boast “butterfly” doors. Why? Because fancy futuristic cars can’t have conventional doors, obvi. It will carry hardware to allow for fully autonomous driving. Made by who? “A soon-to-be-announced partnered supplier,” per the press release. And Fisker will follow this luxury car with an affordable version, so the unwashed masses can forget all about gasoline. When? Sometime after the EMotion debuts in mid-2017. It’s pure Fisker: great looks, big promises. Maybe this time he’ll deliver. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Electric Vehicles henrik fisker Luxury cars Tesla Motors Skip Social.

Perhaps that is to be expected, given that it is Lamborghini were talking about. The Italian automaker wants to join the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in pondering supercars for the third millennium. Lamborghini is hard at work on the technology and vehicles you’ll be lusting after in 2025, but wants to be even more forward-thinking than that. It remains to be seen just what Lamborghini expects from MIT, although anything that comes from the partnership probably would help Lamborghini’s siblings in the Volkswagen Group. Maurizio Reggiani, head of R&D at Lamborghini plans to spend the next few days talking to folks at the university to brainstorm ideas. “The super-sports car is always a laboratory for the future,”Reggiani says. While the “1000-year view” that Reggiani discusses sounds like nothing more than a line in a press release, it is fun to consider where things might go in the next decade or three. MIT excels at robotics, for example, so perhaps an autonomous supercar? Not likely says Reggiani. He believes Lamborghini owners always will insist on driving, but he can see semi-autonomous safety tech playing a role. He favors technology that helps drivers push their limits and sharpen their skills—a view Audi, which VW also owns, has expressed. “Autonomous has a different meaning for Lamborghini,” he says. Lamborghini is seen as a leader in the development and use of carbon fiber in road cars, and MIT’s work with advanced materials is another potential area of collaboration. The automaker has a lab (Lambo Lab!) in Seattle, where it works with Boeing on composite materials. Lamborghini could explore advanced bio-materials with MIT, that mimic the bones in birds, which are strong yet delicate, or perhaps even shape-shifting alloys. “I don’t know whether they’re third millennium,” says Serenella Sferza, co-director of the MIT Italy Program. “They might be fourth.” She’s kidding, of course, but Lamborghini must look to the future. Tightening fuel economy and emissions regulations have automakers embracing efficiency. MIT engineers could help Lamborghini move away from V8, V10, and V12 engines. In an announcement that is almost entirely coincidental, MIT just took another step toward practical, clean, nuclear energy. With a 1,000-year timeline, Lamborghini has plenty of time to develop Mr. Fusion.   Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Lamborghini Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News.

Old-timey colors like “verde British” and “Rosso dino.” A carbon fiber front wing. Extra prancing horse badges. Tinted rear windows (in a two-seater). Chrome on the grille. A “handy fire extinguisher.” You can even buy the F12TDF, the limited edition, track-dedicated version of Ferrari’s flagship. Yet none of it slakes that yearning for what the ancient Romans would have called magis equi frementis. Today’s Italians know it as più cavallino rampante. In the American parlance, MORE FERRARI. Serious Supercars Aston Martin’s $3M Hypercar Takes F1 Performance to the Road Review: 2017 Porsche Panamera Ford’s Extra Special GT Supercar Is a Rolling Ode to American Dominance For that, you can have the F12 Caballería from Spanish boutique design shop Bengala Automotive. Of course, the first way to make MORE FERRARI out of a car that, at 731 horsepower offers no shortage of Ferrari, is to fashion every visible part of the car out of carbon fiber. The second way is to restyle the car, giving it sharper, more aggressive lines inspired by Ferrari’s GT3 race cars. Bengala’s designer made the air intakes bigger, and appears to have carved the front end with a machete. Where the F12berlinetta is elegant, the Caballería is aggressive. Just the thing for some Ferrari customers. “We bring to our customers an interpretation of their desires, based on their dreams,” says company CEO and founder Shoghi Saeidnia. “We mastered and created a unique piece of design and engineering.” That’s the fancy way of saying, “We added some Ferrari to your Ferrari for you.” No word on the price, but given that Bengala plans to build just 10, expect to pay MORE FERRARI money.

From January to October, some 200 people worked in three shifts on the Electrovan, the first electric vehicle powered by a hydrogen fuel cell. It had room for two, weighed 7,100 pounds, and could hit 60 mph in a not-quite-compelling 30 seconds. But it was the first of its kind, a new way of doing things. Hydrogen-powered cars can be refueled in just a few minutes, are just as capable as their gas-loving counterparts, and emit nothing but water as a byproduct. Today, GM heralded the Electrovan’s 50th birthday, noting it has since spent $2.5 billion developing fuel cell technology. Rad, right? Yup, until you realize that for all that time and money, the automaker has made effectively zero progress getting humanity to ditch fossil fuels for hydrogen. Plenty of folks are still pursuing this dream. Honda’s offering the Clarity Fuel Cell sedan in Japan. Toyota’s Mirai is available in the US, starting at nearly $60,000. Chevy just made a hydrogen-powered pickup for the US Army. But no one’s solved the fundamental problems with hydrogen power: There’s no real infrastructure to get the fuel around the country and into cars. And while hydrogen’s the most abundant element in the universe, making it into a useable fuel often involves natural gas—hardly a zero-emissions process. So yeah, GM marking 50 years of working on the stuff is like a a PhD celebrating his tenth year working on that thesis—and insisting he’ll be done real soon. Go Back to Top.

Tesla Motors announced today its new Model S P100D model will hit 60 mph in 2.5 seconds, thanks to a bigger, 100-kWh battery. That’s an upgrade over the P90D’s 2.8 seconds, and just one tenth of a second slower than what the million-dollar Ferrari LaFerrari can do. Except that this is a four-door sedan. The P100D version of the Model X SUV will hit 60 mph in 2.9 seconds. That’s the best stomach swirl for the money the auto industry has ever offered, and a terrific example of how much better electric cars are than internal combustion engines at delivering torque. The bigger battery will also offer 315 miles of range (up from just under 300) in the sedan, Tesla says—but not if you spend all your time enjoying that acceleration. Related Video How Tesla’s Self-Driving Autopilot Actually Works Of course, with great power comes great pricing. Well, great for Tesla, which is charging a base price of $134,500 for its fastest car ever. The P90D with “ludicrous mode” starts at $119,500. The Model X with the bigger pack starts at $135,500. If you’ve ordered a now measly-feeling P90D but haven’t gotten it yet, you can upgrade for $10,000. If you’re already driving one and now feel utterly lame, you can have the extra power installed, but it’ll cost you $20,000. In June, Tesla introduced the cheaper Model S 60, powered by a 75-kWh pack running software that limits its capacity by 20 percent. Customers who later decide they want more power can hand over $9,000, for which Tesla hits a button to update the car’s software and “unlock” the battery’s extra capability. It’s easy to imagine Tesla will do something similar with this bigger pack, for buyers who aren’t quite ready to spend the extra cash. Spend P90D money today, and once the 2.8 second sprint to 60 mph loses its edge, break out the credit card. Is a 0 to 60 mph time improvement of .3 seconds worth the extra cash? Tesla hopes so, because it says every dollar it can make off its luxury models will help fund its efforts to build the long-awaited, affordable Model 3, which should enter production late next year.

To add to the pile, Nissan now introduces the BladeGlider, a Zeus juice-powered razor blade on four wheels. Released in Rio de Janeiro this week, the prototype version of a concept Nissan first showed in 2013 is a 268-horsepower sports car with a heart of green, powered by a 220kW lithium-ion battery. The BladeGlider comes with rear-hinged dihedral doors (because conventional openings have no place in the future) and in two colors: “cyber green” and “stealth orange” (because … deer can’t see it?). The open top lets everyone know who’s releasing the fewest emissions in town, and the three-seat configuration borrowed from the famed McLaren F1 allows room for two passengers. Roll up to the club like the sustainable Liberace you are. You shouldn’t expect Nissan to actually put this thing on the market, but combined with the successful, all-electric Leaf and its leading efforts in the race towards autonomous driving, it’s clear the Japanese automaker’s girding up for the future.

It designed the car to stack up superlatives like a pre-schooler piles blocks: heedlessly. The Veyron was the fastest, most powerful, fanciest, and most completely unnecessary car on the planet for the entirely of its 10-year run. Bugatti made just 450 of them, sold them all for an average of $2.6 million apiece, and reportedly lost money doing it. You almost certainly won’t ever know the God-like power of driving a Veyron, let alone that of its even more gobsmacking successor, the Chiron. But TMB Art Metal will sell you a bit of Veyron, fashioned into a pair of cufflinks. The British firm makes these snazzy accessories from the front wheel of a Veyron damaged in a crash. (Don’t judge; 1,200 horsepower is difficult to control.) Just $385! The cufflinks won’t carry you to 200 mph in under 25 seconds, but given that they cost roughly 385,000 times more than a perfectly serviceable pair of plastic buttons, they’re every bit as impractical and excessive as the car that can.

He doesn’t call it that, of course. He gave it the far more benign name Master Plan, Part Deux. Beyond creating a vertically integrated company that builds electric vehicles, batteries to store the power to propel them, and the solar panels to generate that power, he wants to create whole new vehicle lineups. Some of them sound like they’re in advanced stages of development. The plan, which Musk posted to the Tesla Motors blog on Wednesday afternoon, comes a decade after Part One, which essentially laid out the company’s plan to make boatloads of money with the Model S so it could produce the more affordable Model 3. Having crossed those things off his to-do list—while also outfitting an automobile factory, a battery factory, and, oh, running SpaceX and Solar City—Musk has moved on to the second phase of his plan. Even as the company scrambles to produce the Model 3 sedan that Musk remains convinced will bring EVs to the masses, Tesla Motors, according to the Master Plan, Part Deux, sees itself creating a compact SUV and “a new kind of pickup truck.” Beyond that, Musk says, “there are two other types of electric vehicle needed: heavy-duty trucks and high passenger-density urban transport.” Related Video Tesla’s Summon Feature Is Like Knight Rider. Kinda He means big-rigs and buses, and says both are the early stages of development—and could be revealed next year. “We believe the Tesla Semi will deliver a substantial reduction in the cost of cargo transport, while increasing safety and making it really fun to operate.” Now, electric buses are nothing new. San Francisco is crawling with them. But a Tesla bus? You know it would be gorgeous. Musk says they’d be smaller than you’re used to, but offer plenty of room for wheelchairs, strollers, and bikes. They’ll be quick enough to keep up with traffic, and deliver a smooooth ride. Where things get really wild, though, is his claim that Tesla buses would not have to stick to pre-determined routes like the busses that rumble past your office. A little intelligent planning with smartphones and mapping (think = Uber Pool) can deliver people right to their door. He’s even put some thought into what people without smartphones will do. They can use fixed summon buttons at existing bus stops, which will otherwise be redundant. Looking a little further into the future, Tesla will continue developing its autonomous technology so all of these cars and trucks and buses do the driving. And then come the autonomous ride-sharing services in which Telsa owners let strangers borrow their cars or Tesla operates urban fleets “ensuring you can always hail a ride from us no matter where you are.” Individually, none of these ideas is at all radical. You’d be hard-pressed to find an automaker that isn’t following Google in the race to autonomous cars, Daimler recently unveiled an autonomous big-rig, and a Tesla co-founder has developed a pretty sweet electric garbage truck. What is staggering here is the scale. Musk wants to do it all, immediately, and tie it all together in a cohesive system. It’s so crazy it’s brilliant. And if Musk’s record so far is any indication, don’t bet against him pulling it off.

So “Ole Yeller” feels like a weird moniker for Ford’s latest special edition Mustang, until you realize it’s not named for that most loyal of hounds, at least not directly. The name actually comes from the famed P-51D Mustang fighter plane still flown by stunt pilot Bob Hoover. And it actually makes sense once you know Ford plans to auction off the ride and give the proceeds to charity. Anyway, on to the car. This Ole Yeller is actually a Shelby GT350 Mustang, powered by a 5.2-liter V8 engine that barks out 526 horsepower and 429 pound-paws of torque. Because there’s some measure of justice in this world, the driver controls all that power with a six-speed manual transmission. To make this GT350 extra special, Ford threw in “Ole Yeller” accents and badging, Recaro racing seats, and gauges inspired by plane cockpits. Of course, there’s extra carbon fiber, and the mirrors apparently project images of the P-51. Just don’t park it near any rabid wolves.

Mercedes-Benz wants to do the same for the lowly golf cart. The Germans believe golfers need a more “premium” mode of getting around the links. If you can suspend your skepticism, the Mercedes-Benz Style Edition Garia Golf Car makes a compelling case. It has fancy wheels and a carbon fiber roof and Mercedes describes it as “sporty and well-balanced,” which seems like a stretch. The rear spoiler doubles as a golf bag holder. Of course. Inside, a 10.1-inch touchscreen keeps tabs on your range, (up to 50 miles), lets you select sport (!) and eco modes, and displays a course map and scorecard. A mini fridge under the leather seat keeps your beers cold, and cupholders keep them from toppling when you get up on it. What you don’t get is a 3-pointed star. This ride wears the logo of Garia, the golf cart manufacturer that Mercedes worked with. There’s no word on price yet, but this is a case where asking that question means you can’t afford one.

But if that’s your style and you’ve got the stockpiles of gold to fund it, you may as well combine the two extremes and pick up the LaFerrari convertible, the latest spin on Maranello’s supercar della giornata. The “base” version of the LaFerrari, which entered production in 2013 and costs more than a million dollars, carries an 8.0-liter V12 engine and a 120-kW electric motor that together propel the pile of carbon fiber, leather, and human-shaped money piles to 62 mph in under three seconds, and up to 217 mph. Ferrari apparently put so much brainpower into its most powerful car ever, it didn’t have any left over to think of a real name for the thing. Same goes for the new edition, which Ferrari just calls “the open-top version of the LaFerrari,” a machine for those “who refuse to compromise on the joy of al fresco driving even when at the wheel of a supercar.” The Italians won’t reveal any specs on the new hybrid ride until the Paris Motor Show in October, but say they’ve modified the chassis to be just as rigid as the original coupe, with a tweaked design to make up for the havoc an open top wreaks on the aerodynamics. You can bet your offshore bank account that without a roof in the way, the price will go up, too. Still, it’s one exciting way to get the wind in your hair.

Now, it’s not like the Ford GT needed any improvement. It just walloped Ferrari, Aston Martin, Corvette, and Porsche to win its class at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. But in the supercar realm, there’s always someone who wants more. Ford delivers it with the Ford GT ’66 Heritage Edition, a black and silver homage to the GT40 that swept the Le Mans podium half a century ago. The “standard” 2017 GT runs $400,000 or so, and squeezes more than 600 horsepower from a twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V6 engine. The special edition boasts the same specs but gets comfier seats, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, and blue webbing on the seat belts to match those of the the ’66 car. For bonus points, Ford is making each 20-inch wheel from a single piece of forged aluminum, which is painted gold. And it’s exposing more of the car’s carbon fiber. Because carbon fiber is cool. No word on what the car costs or who’ll get to drive it home. Rest assured it will require a very big check—and a very good application. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

Beyond offering some protection from market upheaval, having a crazy amount of money lets you ask Aston Martin to spend nine months building a one-of-a-kind roadster. The British automaker started with a GT12 Coupe but voted to ditch the roof so the chap could hear the V12 roar. They also swaddled the car in carbon fiber and bolted on a titanium exhaust, because of course they would. A GT12 hits 60 mph in 3.5 seconds and runs $340,000. The convertible is probably a bit slower and one hell of a lot more expensive, even with a cratered pound.  Aston Martin head honcho Andy Palmer says this car “demonstrates the expanded capabilities of Q,” the automaker’s bespoke department.

Maserati Related Galleries Stunning Images Show the Earth's Imperiled Water While You Were Offline: Maybe Joseph Fiennes Playing Michael Jackson Wasn't the Best Idea What Better Way for the Marines to Prepare for Future Wars Than With Sci-Fi? 5 Maserati finally got around to updating the Quattroporte, its flagship sedan. At a glance, you’ll see more chrome on the grille and matte black on just about everything else. It’s nice, but the interesting changes are the new infotainment system and the suite of active safety features. I drove the 2015 Quattroporte S Q4 from Manhattan to its spiritual summer home, the Jersey Shore. The performance impressed me—the sedan hits 60 mph in less than five seconds, thanks to all-wheel drive and a 3.0-liter V6 that thankfully doesn’t keep its voice down. But the Maserati fell short when the road straightened and traffic piled up. I found the infotainment system infuriating, and the navi system’s maps illegible and often incorrect. Worse, the car lacked safety features like blind spot monitoring, and lane departure warning offered on cars one-third its price. This isn’t a problem in sports cars like the Alfa Romeo 4C, the Quattroporte’s corporate comrade, because you expect them to be something of a pain in the ass to live with. But the Quattroporte is a flagship sedan competing with the likes of the Audi A8, Mercedes S-Class, and BMW 7 Series—all of which offer superior amenities. The Maserati starts at $106,900. Buyers may want Italian performance and styling, but they’re also going to want the best of modern automotive technology. So it’s a smart play adding adaptive cruise control, lane departure and forward collision warnings, automatic braking, and a surround view camera, all of which make driving the Quattroporte easier and safer. The infotainment system is built around an 8.4-inch touchscreen, runs Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and ought to be easier to use. Maybe for next year, Maserati can add a gesture control system to suit its Italian heritage. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Luxury cars Maserati Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News.

Christie Hemm Klok/WIRED Tesla’s Model S just got more affordable. Elon Musk’s electric car company announced this morning it will introduce a version of the sedan with a less powerful 60-kilowatt-hour battery pack, at a base price of $66,000. That makes it a bit cheaper than the previous cheapest version of the car, which started at $70,000. The Model S is still very much a luxury car, and that new lower price is still double what Americans pay on average for a new vehicle. But it’s striking because it’s the first time Tesla has made one of its products cheaper. Since its 2012 introduction, Tesla has steadily improved the sleek seven-seater—and the price has gone up accordingly. It was introduced for under $60,000, but the base price had risen up to $70,000. (The top of the line model, the P90D, with all-wheel drive and a 90-kWh battery pack, starts at $109,500.) The sedan now comes with all-wheel drive (a $5,000 option on the new 60-kWh version), autopilot, and a slew of software improvements that make driving on electricity more practical. Related Video Meet the Model 3, Tesla’s Most Important Car The new Model S 60 will offer a range of more than 200 miles (you get close to 300 in the 90D), a 0 to 60 mph time of 5.5 seconds, and standard active safety features. You get the hardware (cameras and radar) necessary for autopilot, but the software that actually lets you take your hands off the wheel will cost you another $2,500. Interestingly, the battery pack in this new car is in reality a more powerful 75-kWh pack, handicapped to perform as if it were a 60-kWh unit. For $9,500, you can unlock the car at any point with an over-the-air software update, and snag a 19 percent range bump. Though it’s possible there are other practical benefits to offering this battery, Tesla says the price drop is a response to potential customers “who would like to buy a Model S, but can more easily afford it only at a lower price point.” Whatever the reasoning, there’s symbolism here. For the past decade, Musk has been promising an electric car for the hoi polloi, to do in this century what Ford’s Model T did in the last. That car will be the Model 3, the $30,000 car Tesla showed off in March, but won’t start building until late 2017, at the earliest. This Model S is no working man’s car, but it’s a step closer to the masses. Related Video Gear Tesla’s Summon Feature Is Like Knight Rider.

More than 500 horsepower, whether from internal combustion, electric motors, or both. Doors that open up (like this), not out (like this). And carbon fiber. Gobs of it. The McLaren 675LT has all of that, which makes creating yet another variation on the theme tough. After all, how do you top dihedral doors and a V8 that sounds like heaven as it produces a demonic 666 horsepower? You make the entire thing out of carbon fiber and call it the “McLaren Special Operations Carbon Series LT.” It’s not like the 675LT Spider, the foundation upon which Mac based this insanity, wanted for carbon. The bumpers, underbody, side skirts, intakes, airbrake, rear fenders, and rear deck are made of the stuff. You might wonder, what’s left? Well, the retractable roof, the A-pillars (the vertical supports between the windshield and doors), the trunk, and the wings. Oh, and the gas tank cap. The Spider weighs just 3,016 pounds, the extra carbon makes the special version even lighter. Necessary? God no. Desirable? Hell yes. McLaren is making just 25 copies, and has already sold each for a bit more than half a million apiece. McLaren plans to start deliveries later this year. That certainly means a few trips up some very long driveways, but the car’s 0 to 62 mph time of 2.9 seconds and 203 mph top speed should get all that gloss-covered carbon fiber to the doorstep right quick.

The Consumer Electronics Show (now officially simply termed CES) turned 50 this year. And yet, rather than turn stale or start to fade into irrelevance, the 2017 show brought some genuine innovation we haven't seen in quite a while. Sure, wacky gadgets and pointless prototypes are all over the place at CES, but this might be the year that many of them actually become reality. For instance, we didn't see many gimmicky curved televisions on the show floor. Instead, LG really wowed us with a new, incredibly thin OLED TV that houses all of its processing power in a sleek connected soundbar. Faraday Future showed off an electric self-driving supercar that can park itself, and should actually make it to market next year. The PowerRay drone from PowerVision doesn't work in the air, like you might expect, but underwater, to help you catch fish. And Razer's Project Valerie, while just a concept, proves that when it comes to gaming laptops, three screens are better than one. Other top products are more about refinement than revolution. Lenovo's Smart Assistant speaker, its take on the Amazon Echo, looks and sounds better than the device it emulates. The Asus Zenfone AR smartphone brings augmented reality (in the form of Google Tango) to a reasonable form factor. And the Misfit Vapor looks and acts a lot like the Apple Watch for nearly half the price. Check Out the Best Photos From CES 2017! It certainly wasn't easy when you take into account the sheer number of devices (and opinions) that funneled into this story, but we've tried our best to highlight the very best of what we've seen over the past week in Las Vegas. We've had some good luck picking in the past, as many devices turned out to earn top marks in testing. (On the other hand, some of them also vanished without a trace.) Ultimately, we're hoping to see all of these gadgets hit the market at some point in the future. But even if it's just some of them, the future looks bright.—Alex Colon Best Laptop Asus ZenBook 3 Deluxe Reports of their death have been greatly exaggerated: Laptops were everywhere at CES this year, in all shapes and sizes. As far as general notebooks go, the Asus ZenBook 3 Deluxe is the one that really caught my eye. This ultra-slim laptop is only 0.5-inch thick, weighs 2.42 pounds, and just looks, well, gorgeous. The aluminum-and-glass body comes in royal blue with gray and gold accents, or in all silver and really makes a statement. A generous (and sharp) 14-inch display in the body of a 13-inch laptop, a speedy Core i7 processor, and up to 1TB of solid-state storage make this ultraportable a winner. —Matthew Buzzi Best Gaming Laptop Dell Inspiron 15 7000 Series The Inspiron 15 7559 was one of our favorite laptops in recent years for its unmatched value, and Dell looks to have done it again. Starting at $799, the new Inspiron 15 can be equipped with an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 or 1050 Ti, an Intel Core i5 or i7 processor, a full HD or 4K UHD screen, and up to 32GB of memory. Storage can be configured up to 512GB M.2 SSD and/or a 1TB hard drive, and all of this fits into a one-inch-thick, chassis that's even nicer looking than before. The Inspiron 15 7000 Series may not be the most powerful gaming system, but it's versatile and fast, with a very attractive price point. —MB Best Convertible Hybrid Laptop HP EliteBook x360 The HP EliteBook x360 is a business laptop with style. Taking plenty of inspiration from the HP Spectre x360, the new convertible model is slim and light, but durable and secure. It's just 0.59 inches thick, but packs plenty of speed and can be configured with up to a 4K touch display. One of its killer features is the optional HP Sure View, a built-in privacy screen that can be toggled on and off with the press of a button. It works like a charm, thwarting prying eyes without the need for one of those unsightly films. —MB Best Phone Asus Zenfone AR Augmented reality is in its very early days, but it's easy to guess that it's going to be even bigger than VR. The Asus Zenfone AR is the first manageably sized smartphone to be able to run both Google's Daydream VR and Tango AR systems. Unlike the gigantic Lenovo Phab 2 Pro, the first Tango device, the Zenfone AR actually feels like a phone you'd want to use, even if you never augment your reality. It has a sharp camera, a high-res screen, a fast Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor, and a nicely textured back. Asus doesn't tend to sell a lot of phones in the US, but this one shows us where Google wants to push all of our forms of reality. —Sascha Segan Best Smartwatch Mistfit Vapor Amidst a sea of forgettable smartwatches at the show, the Misfit Vapor truly stands out. From its comprehensive fitness tracking to its understated elegance, the Vapor is an excellent blend of form and function. Its AMOLED display is bright and colors are vibrant, and its circular touch bezel means you don't have to worry about constantly wiping greasy fingerprints off the screen. And at $199, it's also kinder to your wallet than the Apple Watch Series 2. —Victoria Song Best Camera Panasonic Lumix DMC-GH5 CES was very light on pro camera gear this year, which makes the Panasonic Lumix DMC-GH5 an easy pick for best in show. But even if there had been more competition, Panasonic's latest upgrade of its professional video/still hybrid Micro Four Thirds camera would be a serious contender. It's got everything a professional cinematographer could want, including 4K capture at up to 60fps, in-body image stabilization, programmable focus racks, and support for 10-bit capture. Likewise, still photographers will enjoy its quick autofocus system, quick burst rate, and rugged build. —Jim Fisher Best Drone PowerVision PowerRay Leave it to PowerVision, the company so far best known in the US for making an egg-shaped quadcopter, to remind us that a drone doesn't need to have four rotors and fly through the air. Its PowerRay, a remote-controlled submersible with a built-in 4K video camera and a fish finder, not only allows you to capture high-resolution video of the life aquatic, but it works to improve your chances of reeling in a nice big catch. It's new, different, and a little bit crazy—but if it works, it could end up being more of a friend to fishermen than cough drops ever were. —JF Best Car Faraday Future FF91 Faraday Future has only been around for two years, and has made our best of CES list for both of them. Last year it showed a non-functional dream car, the FFZERO1, but this year the company has a prototype that actually works. The FF91 is a self-driving automobile that runs on a 130kWh battery to deliver up to 378 miles between charges. Throw in a zero-to-60 time of just 2.39 seconds, and you have one of the most innovative automobiles ever assembled. We say assembled, but it isn't exactly clear if Faraday Future will actually make these vehicles. (The company had to stop production on its factory late last year because of cash flow problems.) Faraday Future is taking pre-orders for the FF91 now, along with a $5,000 deposit. The earliest the FF91 will ship is 2018 and there's final price yet. And then there is the fact we have no idea if its actually smart enough to safely navigate public roads. Any way you look at it, the Faraday Future FF91 is a long shot. Then again, we said the same thing about Tesla. —Dan Costa Best Television LG Signature W OLED Organic light-emitting diode (OLED) technology can produce excellent pictures on incredibly thin panels. LG is pushing the limits of what OLED can do with the Signature W series. This TV does away with the bezel and the body of the screen, leaving you with only a 0.1-inch-thick rectangle you can hang on your wall like a poster. All of the processing and connections are offloaded to a soundbar connected with a single ribbon cable, and that soundbar adds Dolby Atmos audio compatibility to the TV's Dolby Vision and HDR-10 video capabilities. Expect a pretty hefty price tag for such a slim TV. Still, wow. —Will Greenwald Best Home Theater Gear Dish AirTV As a media streamer, Dish's AirTV is a simple Android TV box that focuses on Sling TV. It wouldn't be particularly impressive next to any Amazon Fire TV or Roku device. However, an OTA TV tuner and a focus on accessibility could make the AirTV a boon for less tech-savvy cord-cutters. This $129.99 bundle jumps straight into Sling TV, letting you access both live TV over the subscription service and OTA television with an antenna, along with your Netflix queue on the same screen. —WG Best Audio Product Lenovo Smart Assistant The Lenovo Smart Assistant is a lot like Amazon's Echo, only better. It looks better, sounds better, and costs less. Just like the Echo, the Smart Assistant uses Amazon's Alexa voice assistant, which will answer your questions, make grocery lists, and, of course, order stuff from Amazon. The $129.99 speaker comes equipped with a 5-watt tweeter and a 10-watt woofer. An upgraded Harman Kardon Edition includes an extra 2-inch sound cavity for enhanced sound quality (no pricing has been announced). We're looking forward to a head-to-head comparison with the Echo when it comes out in May. —AC Best Gaming Gear Innex Super Retro Boy If you couldn't tell from the NES Classic Edition, the hottest game systems of the holiday season, retro gaming is bigger than ever. Innex is one of a handful of companies that focuses on helping you play your classic games. The company showed off several new ways to play old favorites, but the standout is the Super Retro Boy. This Game Boy-shaped device can play Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance cartridges, with a backlit color screen and 10-hour battery life. There's a reason the Game Boy and Game Boy Advance dominated handheld gaming for two decades, and this little time machine will remind you why.—WG Best AR/VR Headset Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 VR Headset Unlike most VR headsets, which require a connected phone or computer, Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 VR headset is a completely standalone product. Similar to the HTC Vive, the Qualcomm headset can actually sense when you're moving, which means you can walk around and the virtual world you see will respond accordingly (though the HTC Vive accomplishes this with sensors you place around your room). It's only a reference device right now, but it's a cool concept we hope to see adopted in some consumer-ready products this year. —AC Best Smart Home Device Sleep Number 360 Smart Bed Sleep Number pioneered the idea of a mattress with two unique settings, but those settings have always required user input. With the Sleep Number 360, the company has released a bed that will adapt to your body in real time. You can still manually set your ideal "number," but the 360 will also respond to your nocturnal rocks and rolls, adjusting mattress firmness automatically. The bed also includes a foot warmer that turns on automatically at your usual bed time. And if you are one of those people with a partner who snores, the bed will automatically lift their head to improve air flow and dampen the noise. Of course, all of this can be controlled via an app, and the mattress also supports Nest and IFTTT integrations. —DC Best Smart Appliance LG Smart InstaView Refrigerator If you're in the market for a high-end fridge with all the bells and whistles, this is it. The LG Smart InstaView features a 29-inch touch screen on its upper right door on which you can browse recipes and leave notes for family members. There are cameras that take photos of your food, and connect with an app so you can see what's inside wherever you are. The coolest part, and what sets it apart from Samsung's Family Hub refrigerator, is that it uses Amazon's Alexa voice assistant, so you can ask it to play music, report the news or weather, and a perform a host of other nifty tricks. —Angela Moscaritolo Best Fitness Wearable Motiv Ring Who says a fitness tracker has to be worn on your wrist? While smart rings aren't exactly new, the Motiv Ring stands out for a number of reasons. For starters, it measures the same metrics that larger, wrist-based fitness trackers do: steps, heart rate, calories burned, sleep, distance traveled, and activity types. It's also waterproof up to 160 feet, so you can wear it in the pool or while washing dishes. Plus, its clever charging port means you don't have to lug around yet another cable. If the Motiv Ring proves to be as accurate as the best wrist-based models, it could bring fitness tracking to a whole new level—your finger. —VS Best Desktop HP Sprout Pro The original Sprout had some issues, but HP's new Sprout Pro is undoubtedly the coolest desktop at CES this year. It projects a 21.3-inch full HD digital mat down onto the desk, similar to its predecessor. The kicker, though, is that the new Sprout can now perform 2D and 3D scanning, by taking a real object and turning it into a 3D model in seconds after you rotate it in view of the cameras. You can enhance the digital version further by snapping some HD pictures of each side, making the digital textures much higher-resolution than the scan. It's a fast, easy process, and the implications across multiple fields like education and medicine could be tremendous. It also functions as a standard desktop, and the camera is relatively innocuous considering its capabilities. —MB Best Display Dell Canvas Dell's Canvas is a horizontal Surface Studio-like device with a few key differences. It has no PC hardware of its own, which greatly reduces the cost (around $1,799). Instead, it connects to an existing PC and monitor, serving as a second input-focused screen. The 27-inch display is a cool, natural evolution of an artist's analog workspace, complete with a tool called the Totem that allows for physical control of the digital UI by placing it on the screen. With QHD resolution, it looks sharp, but isn't as demanding as 4K, which makes it better suited to working with a wider array of systems. —MB Best Networking Product Linksys Velop It seems as though the standard Wi-Fi router might be going the way of the dodo in 2017. Actually, probably not, but in wireless networking, Mesh-based Wi-Fi systems, which promise to blanket your home with seamless coverage that extends to every last corner, are all the rage right now. Products like Eero, Google Wifi, Luma, and many others fit the same profile: Slick design, easy app-enabled setup and use, minimal configuration options. And the Linksys Velop follows suit. It's rare that we get to test a product that debuts at CES before the show, but we've been using Velop for a few weeks and it's the best Wi-Fi system we've tested. Networking vet Linksys is late to the game here, but brings a top-notch app with well designed, future-proof hardware that delivers the fastest single stream and MU-MIMO throughput speeds we've seen. In fact, it's our Editors' Choice. —Wendy Sheehan Donnell Best Toy Lego Boost Lego Mindstorms is one of our favorite robotics kits, but it's pretty complicated and expensive. Lego Boost is Mindstorms' friendlier, more affordable little brother. The kit is just over half the price of Mindstorms, and its Move Hub brick lets you program it with a mobile device to do almost anything. Thanks to sensors, motors, and basing all of the processing around your tablet instead of the Move Hub itself, you can build a car, a cat, a guitar, or even a Lego-building 3D printer. All of these projects are just the first steps to making your own creations with Boost and its simple, flexible programming interface. —WG Best Robot Kuri Kuri from Mayfield Robotics has personality in spades. From its intergalactic space penguin aesthetic, to its adorable chirps, bleeps, and bloops, Kuri is one of the first personal assistant robots to evoke the same emotional response as beloved fictional characters like BB-8 and Wall-E. But cuteness isn't all it has going for it. Kuri is able to navigate past obstacles, read bedtime stories, play your favorite tunes or podcasts, patrol your home, and tell your naughty pup to get down from the couch. If you're willing to plunk down $700, it'll probably take no time to develop an emotional attachment—and that's real progress toward making the Singularity a lot less scary. —VS Best New Technology Aira There are more than 20 million visually impaired people in the United States, and by and large they get around just fine. There are times, however, when a second pair of eyes could be useful. That is what Aira delivers. By using either Google Glass or Vuzix glasses and a Wi-Fi hotspot, Aira allows the blind to show an agent what they are seeing. Agents get a live video picture along with Google map data. This can help a visually impaired person navigate a crowded intersection, or just choose between brands at the grocery store. Agents are on call 12 hours a day, and charges start at under 40 cents per minute. Aira is basically vision-as-a-service, and perhaps even more remarkable, a Google Glass application people will actually use. —DC Best Concept/Prototype Razer Project Valerie While this three-screen, 12K laptop may not ever end up as a consumer product, it's still one of the most talked-about and ambitious concepts in Vegas this year. Two 4K displays spread out like wings from the main screen, and fold into the extra room behind the primary display when not in use. Project Valerie is only about as thick as two Razer Blade Pros stacked together, and somehow, it was able to run a game at full resolution across the three screens, which is a pretty amazing feat. (Granted, specs are under wraps, and it did get quite warm while playing.) Still, it looks completely outrageous, and may stay the stuff of dreams forever, but isn't dreaming big what CES is all about? —MB Back to top Previous : What to Expect at CES 2017 Get a Samsung 55-Inch 4K HDTV for $750 Next : By PCMag Staff Check out our masthead to see who we are, and what we do.

The Nexus 6’s Android 7.1.1 update is now available. It should be rolling out over the air, but if you’ve got an N6 and don’t feel like waiting any longer for your helping of Android 7.1.1, you can grab the factory image or OTA image directly from Google and sideload them now if that's something you're comfortable doing. The build number for the update is N6F26Q. Google first released Android 7.1.1 to Pixel and Nexus phones in early December, but the Nexus 6 had to wait for its helping of 7.1.1 because Google discovered a “last minute bug” with that update. The issue was taken care of by the end of December, though, and now Nexus 6 owners can kick off 2017 with the latest version of Nougat. Android 7.1.1 contains some notable new features, like the ability to long press on an app icon to get shortcuts for jumping to certain parts of that app. So if you’ve got a Nexus 6, be on the lookout for your Android 7.1.1 update so that you can install it and get those new features as soon as possible.

This could become reality because the pop megastar took on a role usually assumed by investigative journalists: She decided to “follow the money.” So when she discovered Apple was prepared to give away her songs for free (no royalties) in a promotion for its streaming service, Swift told Apple, “I don’t ask for free iPhones, so why free music?” Apple backed down after Swift wrote an open letter to its CEO Tim Cook, and not only paid for her music offering during the promotion period, but the tunes of every other artist. Related The Bart & Fleming Podcast Episode #9: New Year, New Beginning Swift’s rebellion may pay dividends long term by pointing up this broader question: Why is it that, while vastly more creative content is being consumed worldwide, less revenue is flowing to the people who create it? This is the issue probed by Jonathan Taplin in an important new book that demonstrates how intellectual property has been hijacked by what he calls the new “marketing monoculture” led by Facebook, Amazon and Google. Taplin even puts a number on it: He estimates that some $50 billion a year has been quietly shifting from content creators to “owners of the monopoly platforms.” Little, Brown Taplin’s book, from Little, Brown, is titled Move Fast And Break Things: How Google, Facebook And Amazon Cornered Culture And Undermined Democracy. Its message seems timelier following the recent techno love-fest between the web giants and President-elect Donald Trump. Taplin’s own career has spanned the creative spectrum, starting as a roadie for Bob Dylan; he then moved into film production, then academia where he directed the Annenberg Innovation Laboratory at USC. I have known Taplin for years and have found him to be a smart and thoughtful student of the cultural landscape. Having examined it from different perspectives he became infuriated by its anomalies. Why, he asks, have creative people, and the companies who control content, tolerated a level of piracy that has impoverished everyone except the kleptocrats who distribute content? One reason: We’ve all been distracted by the wrong issues. Objections have been raised to the proposed merger of Time Warner and AT&T, for example; yet the combined $300 billion market cap of these companies is about half that of Alphabet, the parent of Google. According to Taplin, every pirated music video or song on YouTube or Facebook “robs the creators of income,” given that YouTube is dominated by unlicensed content. YouTube presides over a 55% market share of streaming audio. To be sure, this phenomenon is especially rampant in the news business where revenues from advertising have been all but obliterated as Facebook (among others) has sucked up a giant share of digital advertising revenue. But the dangers, Taplin argues, go beyond the flow of money to the flow of news, real or fake. “We have ceded much of our freedom to choose by giving networks like Google and Facebook control of our (news) menu,” Taplin points out AP Few of us “outsiders” understand exactly how the news menu is determined by the black box algorithms, which significantly shape the course of our digital lives and beliefs. According to Jim Rutenberg, writing in the New York Times, the election of Trump might potentially present an opportunity for news organizations to challenge this. “Buying a subscription is tantamount to supporting the pillars of democracy” — that’s the new post-election sales pitch from magazines ranging from Vanity Fair to the New Yorker to The Atlantic, he reports. The home page banner of Vanity Fair heralds that it is “the magazine Donald Trump doesn’t want you to read.” Conde Nast claims a record 42,000 new signups by last Sunday. What can creatives do about these phenomena? Taplin for one is launching a series of Artist Rights Forums, visiting creative communities nationwide which he feels are “in denial.” He firmly believes artists can be mobilized to support legislation and other initiatives to restore a degree of equity in the distribution of artistic income. In short, more people should follow the money, like Taylor Swift did. “Taylor Swift won her battle with Apple last year,” Taplin said, “but only a very few artists have the muscle to set the terms of their deal.” Subscribe to Deadline Breaking News Alerts and keep your inbox happy 12 12 Comments Cancel reply Comments On Deadline Hollywood are monitored.

Millennial filmmaker • on Jan 6, 2017 9:28 am The older generation has ignored the cries for help from young artists. We don’t get VHS or DVD residuals or royalties. We don’t get to control the distribution of our products. The unions stay silent and the old media is too busy selling themselves off to China. Depressing how the older generation eats it’s children. Reply Anonymous • on Jan 6, 2017 11:18 am Fair enough, but at the same time, maybe you need to stand up for yourself and not give it away for free-create your own distribution and platforms, say no to big content… Reply Millennial filmmaker • on Jan 7, 2017 10:12 pm What do you expect us to do, put our work on VHS? Reply Film people • on Jan 6, 2017 9:35 am In addition to music, YouTube is filled with pirated movies and TV shows. They could stop them if they wanted, but they don’t, because their business is clicks. It’s really disgusting and hypocritical. Reply Nerdrage • on Jan 6, 2017 9:39 am Exactly what I have been saying for a while. Content is not king, distribution is, or will be. Content production is exploding while distribution is telescoping because customers want breadth of access, not multiple subscriptions. They go right for the biggest option. More and more content will be competing for mindshare in constricted pipes. Reply Stanford Crane • on Jan 6, 2017 10:05 am My view from Palo Alto is that Taplin has tapped into an area that the intellectually dishonest Silicon Valley doesn’t want to talk about, so I wrote a script called Vultures in the Valley which tells the real story. I showed it to two venture capitalists. One called it “disturbingly real” and the other called it “brilliant”. I hope it’s both, but it will probably never see the screen because of that. Most people have no idea how messed up the culture is. BTW, I am the founder of the Silicon Valley Incubator. Reply Anonymous • on Jan 6, 2017 10:54 am Peter Bart hates me, & I guess I’ll never be prez of his fan club, but hooray & for his piece about how content creators are being royally ripped off by monster monoliths of the New Age ( & Jonathan Taplin’s new book on that topic). “News” of course is now just more content, lumped with hillbilly tunes & slasher flix, yet it is still the vital lube of a democracy. Attention MUST be paid & I know that Mr Bart will be paying lots of it in weeks & months ahead. I look forward to it, if not to much else in the media maelstrom. Reply TOM SHALES • on Jan 6, 2017 10:57 am My comment was certainly not meant to be anonymous but these timy little boxes are sure damn hard to write in Reply T.B. • on Jan 6, 2017 10:58 am This argument is as old as time. Greed, the human condition, call it what you will. The cycle will continue. It’s part of who we are. Old. Young. Male. Female. White. Black. Red. Yellow. It’s who we are…… Reply Tom Shales • on Jan 6, 2017 10:59 am What “anonymous” dammit? I never hide behind anonymity– I’m too big a ham for one thing. — Tom Shales, as i keep trying to tell you. That is, your damn dumb computer. Reply Robert Benjamin • on Jan 11, 2017 8:08 pm A timely article, a few of us have been working on hacking the system of limited ownership which led these online distribution monopolies growing massively off the back of “free” user generated contributions. We’re creating what are called Balanced Ownership Platform Cooperatives where the users (creators, audience, etc) own the platform. Its just the beginning but it will bring the economic value of creation back into the hands of creators/artists where it belongs. Check out what Members Media Cooperative is doing. Reply J. S. Greenfield • on Jan 13, 2017 9:45 am I sure hope there’s more substance to the book than there is to this summary, for the above amounts to little more than name-calling and an assertion that Google, Facebook and Amazon *must* be doing something wrong, because they’re making a lot of money.

Chinese Search Engine giant in partnership with brand AiNemo demoed a voice-controlled virtual family Baidu robot. Dubbed “Little Fish,” a translation of its Chinese name “Xiaoyu Zaijia,” the AI has most of Alexa’s talents along with a big screen, camera and touch of robotics. Little Fish is manufactured by AiNemo and powered by Baidu’s AI assistant platform DuerOS. Baidu’s AI platform is already compatible with several local services in China. Little Fish Features Unlike “faceless” Amazon Alexa or Google Home devices, Little Fish is prominently defined by its touchscreen display. Neither Baidu nor AiNemo have yet revealed the exact specifics of the Little Fish’s display. It could be at least six inches in size diagonally according to Android Headlines.

It also processes on-demand services such as ordering takeout or movie tickets and control home appliances, all in one go. There is also a camera on the top to track and the screen swivels to keep facing a speaker. The camera can also be used for making video calls and more. Also, you can call in to Little Fish from your phone and pan its camera remotely. The device is even capable of operating other Internet of Things devices.

The accessory will be called Huawei View and is be compatible with the Huawei Mate 9 Pro and the Huawei Mate 9 Porsche design.

File picture: Eric Risberg San Francisco - There's a quirky twist on tourism emerging amid the Silicon Valley whirlwind of innovation that has tethered everyone to their smartphones. Those omnipresent devices are being used to track down technological touchstones scattered around the San Francisco Bay area so selfies can be taken, videos can be recorded and the experience can be celebrated in a Facebook post, Snapchat or tweet. Here's a tourist's guide to nerd nirvana for those more interested in seeing the suburban home where The Woz built the first Apple computer alongside Steve Jobs than the spooky prison in the Bay where the Birdman of Alcatraz once served time alongside Machine Gun Kelly. Growing up in a garage Silicon Valley startups have a history of humble beginnings, dating to 1939 when Hewlett-Packard was founded in a Palo Alto, California, garage. It still stands at 367 Addison Ave., considered by many to be the birthplace of Silicon Valley. HP now owns the place. Jobs was one of many entrepreneurs influenced by the HP legacy as a teenager, eventually inspiring him and his engineering friend, Steve “The Woz” Wozniak, to begin working on Apple's first computer in the home of Jobs' parents. That ranch-style house at 2066 Crist Drive in Los Altos, California, is now owned by Jobs' sister, Patricia. After they started Google in 1998, co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin built what would become the world's dominant search engine in a garage and room they rented from Susan Wojcicki, whom they later hired (she now runs YouTube for them). The Menlo Park, California, house, at 232 Santa Margarita Ave., is now owned by Google. Shortly after starting Facebook in his Harvard dorm room in 2004, Mark Zuckerberg and a few friends moved to Silicon Valley for what they thought would be just one summer. Zuckerberg never returned to Harvard, and the world hasn't been quite the same since then. The Palo Alto, California house where Zuckerberg did a lot of computer coding and threw some wild parties, if you believe the movies, is located at 819 La Jennifer Way. The place is still rented out by young entrepreneurs hoping some of Zuckerberg's magic will rub off on them. Tech temples The headquarters of Apple, Google and Facebook have turned into must-see shrines to products that have become part of culture's lifeblood. None of the companies offers public tours, but that doesn't mean you can't steal glimpses at these factories of innovation. Search starts here Google is the most accessible of the three headquarters. The hub of its Mountain View, California, campus is at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, with other Google offices sprawling almost all the way down to the nearby NASA Ames Research Center, where Page and Brin keep personal jets in a hangar. Walk down Charleston Road and you are bound to see one of the company's employees (also known as “Googlers”) cruising on yellow, green, blue and red bikes placed outside all the offices to get to meetings more quickly. While strolling around, make sure to swing into the office at 1981 Landings Drive, where you can take a selfie with Android statues memorialising different versions of the operating system that powers most of the world's smartphones. Each statue represents a dessert because Google has nicknamed each version after something sweet. The menu includes Cupcake, Donut, Eclair, Froyo, Gingerbread, Honeycomb, Ice Cream Sandwich, Jelly Bean, KitKat, Lollipop and Marshmallow. The latest serving of Android, called Nougat, has just started rolling out. Finally, in the Google store on the main campus, you can buy company-branded merchandise, including shirts, hats, mugs, pens and even notebooks (the kind with paper). A place everyone likes The giant thumbs-up sign replicating Facebook's symbol for liking a post has become one of the most photographed spots in Silicon Valley since the social networking company moved its headquarters from Palo Alto to 1 Hacker Way in nearby Menlo Park five years ago. Unless you happen to be in a plane or have a camera-equipped drone, you won't be able to see what's on top of another Facebook building across the street (an underground tunnel connects the offices). That building, designed by famed architect Frank Gehry, features a nine-acre park atop the roof. One more thing Apple, founded in 1976, has had a fiercely loyal following for decades, so its Cupertino, California, headquarters has long drawn tourists looking to get a picture of its famous logo and the 1 Infinite Loop sign denoting its address. There is, of course, an Apple store at the headquarters, where people can buy company-branded merchandise not sold in most of its other stores. But you can't get help fixing your iPhone, iPad or Mac here. You'll have to go to another store for an appointment at the Genius Bar that serves as Apple's customer-help desk. The current headquarters will be overshadowed next year when Apple plans to open a nearby 2.8 million-square-foot, circular office that has been likened to a huge spaceship sitting on a 176-acre site. Known as “Campus 2”, the new building is designed to accommodate about 12 000 workers. Before Jobs died in 2011, he stipulated that the campus should be surrounded by about 7 000 trees. TV show The HBO comedy Silicon Valley has won many accolades over three seasons, so fans may want to see the house that serves as headquarters for the fictional startup, Pied Piper. The location has been given as 5230 Newell Road in Palo Alto on the series, but that address doesn't exist. The house is actually is in southern California, at 5230 Penfield Avenue in Woodland Hills. So put it on the sightseeing list for your next visit to Hollywood.

The Latest New Products Must-See Join CNET Member Benefits Sign In to CNET My Profile Forums Sign Out Australia China France Germany Japan Korea United Kingdom US Editions English Español CNET Appliances Smart Home Nvidia Spot Nvidia Spot is like a Google Home you stick on your wall January 6, 2017 8:56 AM PST The Nvidia Spot. James Martin/CNET The Google Assistant's expanding its repertoire as an entertainer. At CES, Nvidia showed off the new Shield TV. Say the word and you can search for content, pause or rewind with your voice, all powered by Google's software. The Shield TV will even display information if you search the internet, and it works with SmartThings to control your home. If you buy the $200 streamer, you won't even have to be in the same room to talk to Google, thanks to a $50 add-on called the Nvidia Spot. The Shield TV is out later this month. The Spot's release date hasn't been specified. An always listening controller with the Google Assistant built-in, the Nvidia Spot sure sounds a lot like a Google Home. The Spot looks different -- a round orb as opposed to a white cylinder. You'll also be able to easily move the Spot from room to room and even attach it to walls. Otherwise, a lot of the functionality sounds the same as Google's own product -- you'll be able to command your TV, search the web and control your smart home via voice command. Nvidia specified SmartThings integration for Spot and Shield, but Google Assistant works with more platforms than that on Google Home -- so I wonder if Spot has a more limited version of the Assistant. 57 Check out all the smart home products at CES 2017 (so far) Nvidia's platform will offer more streaming options than Google's products can do on their own. With a Google Home and a Chromecast streamer plugged into your TV, you can control Netflix and YouTube with your voice. Shield's promised those platforms, plus Amazon Video, Google Play movies and Vudu. We've been looking for Google Home to expand its functionality at CES. The Shield TV is a nice step -- if somewhat redundant. The Spot itself looks to serve the same purpose as Home, and the integration expands upon something the Google Assistant already did. Still, I'm glad to see the Google Assistant gaining new partners -- it needs to in order to keep up with Amazon at CES.

We don't know just how many devices Google has shifted, but the reviews have been largely positive, and the move seems to have been a success. Now Google has made a clean break, it's in brand new territory - so what will it do with the Pixel 2 in 2017? The story so far The very first Pixel has only been with us since October 2016, but the way Google handled the Nexus range of phones might give us some clues about what the future holds. From the Nexus One to the Nexus 6P, the flagship stock Android handsets were released in January 2010, December 2010, October 2011, November 2012, October 2013, November 2014 and September 2015, with the Pixel and Pixel XL then appearing in October 2016. There's obviously a pattern there of an autumn release and it would be a surprise if the Pixels didn't follow that - even more of a surprise considering the likes of Apple, Samsung and Google's other rivals are locked into yearly release cycles at this stage. The Pixel 2 and Pixel XL 2 are likely to be with us in October 2017 then, and Google may well stick with HTC as its uncredited hardware partner - that is if it still needs a hardware partner this time around. If Google is relying less on someone else to make the phone, and bringing more of the hardware process in house, it may be able to launch the Pixel 2 even sooner. How many Pixels will there be? We've now used to Apple launching a smaller and a larger handset every September, and it makes sense to cater to as wide a group of people as possible, with two different screen sizes and two different starting price points every year. That was probably Google's thinking last October and there's no real reason why it would deviate from it in 2017. Both Pixels are pretty much identical, except for the screen size, screen resolution and battery capacity - unlike the iPhones, there's no variation in the camera configuration. Of course Apple has the iPhone SE as a third option - but that kind of nostalgic blast from the past is unlikely to be an option Google's going to take anytime soon. In fact we don't think there's going to be a third phone of any size, and we'd be very surprised if Google didn't stick to the Pixel 2 and Pixel XL 2 in October. Don't forget Google already has a Pixel C tablet, which may well get an update of its own at some point during 2017, so it has the larger screen covered. Google Pixel 2: rumours and speculation It's been quiet on the Pixel 2 rumour front so far - very quiet - so we can only assume Google runs a tight ship as far as smartphone leaks go. News of the original Pixel did trickle out a few months ahead of time, but there wasn't quite the same level of speculation as we're used to for the Apple iPhone. There is one rumour of note worth mentioning that concerns the last Pixel: that HTC replaced Huawei as Google's hardware partner late in the day, just nine months before the phone was due to be released. If Google has a longer run up this time around then we can expect a handset that's even more polished and desirable - perhaps we'll get those optional extras like waterproofing and wireless charging that were missing from the 2016 Pixel phones. No doubt we'll start to hear more about what the Pixel 2 and Pixel XL 2 have in store for us as the year progresses, but don't hold your breath for anything revolutionary - as Google Assistant shows, the biggest innovations may well be on the software side. Google Pixel 2: what we're expecting The Snapdragon 835 already looks set to be the go-to mobile CPU of choice during 2017, and it's a good bet that it's going to find its way into Google's Pixel phones too, bringing better performance alongside less drain on the battery. Elsewhere there are likely to be minor improvements: the 4GB of RAM might get bumped to 6GB, and the smaller phone might get an upgrade to the 2,560 x 1,440 QHD resolution sported by the larger one, though it makes less of a difference on a 5-inch screen. Much was made of the camera on board the Pixel and Pixel XL last year, and Google will probably want to focus on this again in 2017 - there might even be room for a dual-lens approach, to follow Apple's lead, and perhaps optical image stabilisation too. Don't forget the virtual reality angle either. There might not be a new Daydream View headset in 2017, but the new Pixels will definitely be built to be compatible with it, and any spec bumps will be made with VR in mind.  Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

[Photo: Flickr user Funkblast] Recent posts How To (Finally) Quit Multitasking In These Five Daily Activities Advice From Ralph Lauren Innovation Chief David Lauren: Be The Shark PowerPoint Isn't Dead Yet: Three Presentation Tips That Still Work In 2017 Mordechai Guri, Yisroel Mirsky, and Yuval Elovici 01.06.17 12:00 PM It’s not often that any one of us needs to dial 911, but we know how important it is for it to work when one needs it. It is critical that 911 services always be available—both for the practicality of responding to emergencies, and to give people peace of mind. But a new type of attack has emerged that can knock out 911 access—our research explains how these attacks occur as a result of the system’s vulnerabilities. We show how these attacks can create extremely serious repercussions for public safety. In recent years, people have become more aware of a type of cyberattack called "denial-of-service," in which websites are flooded with traffic—often generated by many computers hijacked by a hacker and acting in concert with each other. This happens all the time, and has affected traffic to financial institutions, entertainment companies, government agencies and even key internet routing services. A similar attack is possible on 911 call centers. In October, what appears to be the first such attack launched from a smartphone happened in Arizona. An 18-year-old hacker was arrested on charges that he conducted a telephone denial-of-service attack on a local 911 service. If we are to prevent this from happening in more places, we need to understand how 911 systems work, and where the weaknesses lie, both in technology and policy. Understanding Denial Of Service Computer networks have capacity limits—they can handle only so much traffic, so many connections, at one time. If they get overloaded, new connections can’t get through. The same thing happens with phone lines—which are mostly computer network connections anyway. So if an attacker can manage to tie up all the available connections with malicious traffic, no legitimate information—like regular people browsing a website, or calling 911 in a real emergency—can make it through. This type of attack is most often done by spreading malware to a great many computers, infecting them so that they can be controlled remotely. Smartphones, which are after all just very small computers, can also be hijacked in this way. Then the attacker can tell them to inundate a particular site or phone number with traffic, effectively taking it offline. Many internet companies have taken significant steps to guard against this sort of attack online. For example, Google Shield is a service that protects news sites from attacks by using Google’s massive network of internet servers to filter out attacking traffic while allowing through only legitimate connections. Phone companies, however, have not taken similar action. Addressing The 911 Telephone System Before 1968, American emergency services had local phone numbers. People had to dial specific numbers to reach the fire, police, or ambulance services—or could dial "0" for the operator, who could connect them. But that was inconvenient, and dangerous—people couldn’t remember the right number, or didn’t know it because they were just visiting the area. The 911 system was created to serve as a more universal and effective system. As it has developed over the years, a 911 caller is connected with a specialized call center—called a public safety answering point—that is responsible for getting information from the caller and dispatching the appropriate emergency services. These call centers are located in communities across the country, and each provides service to specific geographic regions. Some serve individual cities, while others serve wider areas, such as counties. When telephone customers dial 911 on their landlines or mobile phones, the telephone companies’ systems make the connection to the appropriate call center. To better understand how denial-of-service attacks could affect 911 call systems, we created a detailed computer simulation of North Carolina’s 911 infrastructure, and a general simulation of the entire U.S. emergency-call system. Investigating The Impact Of An Attack After we set up our simulation, we attacked it to find out how vulnerable it is. We found that it was possible to significantly reduce the availability of 911 service with only 6,000 infected mobile phones—just 0.0006 percent of the state’s population. Using only that relatively small number of phones, it is possible to effectively block 911 calls from 20% of North Carolina landline callers, and half of mobile customers. In our simulation, even people who called back four or five times would not be able to reach a 911 operator to get help. Nationally, a similar percentage, representing just 200,000 hijacked smartphones, would have a similar effect. But this is, in a certain sense, an optimistic finding. Trey Forgety, the director of government affairs for the National Emergency Number Association, responded to our findings in the Washington Post, saying, "We actually believe that the vulnerability is in fact worse than [the researchers] have calculated." Policy Makes The Threat Worse These sorts of attacks could, potentially, be made less effective if malicious calls were identified and blocked at the moment they were placed. Mobile phones have two different kinds of identifying information. The IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity) is the phone number a person must call to reach that phone. The IMEI (International Mobile Station Equipment Identity) is used to track the specific physical device on the network. A defense system could be set up to identify 911 calls coming from a particular phone that has made more than a certain number of 911 calls in a given period of time—say more than 10 calls in the last two minutes. This raises ethical problems—what if there is a real and ongoing emergency, and someone keeps losing phone reception while talking to a dispatcher? If they called back too many times, would their cries for help be blocked? In any case, attackers who take over many phones could circumvent this sort of defense by telling their hijacked phones to call less frequently—and by having more individual phones make the calls. But federal rules to ensure access to emergency services mean this issue might be moot anyway. A 1996 Federal Communications Commission order requires mobile phone companies to forward all 911 calls directly to emergency dispatchers. Cellphone companies are not allowed to check whether the phone the call is coming from has paid to have an active account in service. They cannot even check whether the phone has a SIM card in place. The FCC rule is simple: If anyone dials 911 on a mobile phone, they must be connected to an emergency call center. The rule makes sense from a public safety perspective: If someone is having (or witnessing) a life-threatening emergency, they shouldn’t be barred from seeking help just because they didn’t pay their cellphone bill, or don’t happen to have an active account. But the rule opens an vulnerability in the system, which attackers can exploit. A sophisticated attacker could infect a phone in a way that makes it dial 911 but report it does not have a SIM card. This "anonymized" phone reports no identity, no phone number and no information about who owns it. Neither the phone company nor the 911 call center could block this call without possibly blocking a legitimate call for help. The countermeasures that exist, or are possible, today are difficult and highly flawed. Many of them involve blocking certain devices from calling 911, which carries the risk of preventing a legitimate call for help. But they indicate areas where further inquiry—and collaboration between researchers, telecommunications companies, regulators and emergency personnel—could yield useful breakthroughs. For example, cellphones might be required to run a monitoring software to block themselves from making fraudulent 911 calls. Or 911 systems could examine identifying information of incoming calls and prioritize those made from phones that are not trying to mask themselves. We must find ways to safeguard the 911 system, which protects us all. The authors are security researchers at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev. This article originally appeared at The Conversation.

Google has been trying to position the vast network of smartphones running its Android operating system for virtual and augmented reality, known as VR and AR, fields that many in the technology industry say are poised to go mainstream after years of niche appeal. Chinese manufacturer Huawei announced on Thursday that two of its phones will soon work with Daydream View, a VR headset released last year by Google. Meanwhile, Taiwanese manufacturer AsusTek Computer Inc announced that its ZenFone AR will support both Daydream and Google’s Tango software for AR, in which computer-generated content is overlaid on the real world. While the announcements expand the line-up of participating phones, Google still has much to do to take its technology to the masses, said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research, noting that Samsung has yet to sign on. “Google’s ecosystem for both AR and VR is in the very early days,” he said. As growth in the global smartphone market shows signs of slowing, some manufacturers are voicing optimism that AR and VR will revive consumer enthusiasm. “This is the next wave of technology that is really going to get consumers excited about smartphones,” Erik Hermanson, Asus’ head of marketing for mobile products, said. Apps might be expected to stimulate demand, but until Google’s technology is available on a wider range of phones, it will be tough to persuade developers to build for the platform, analysts said.

SUBSCRIBE Google to start showing local-specific phone numbers when location extensions appear in ads Advertisers that depend on calls going to a central phone number for conversion tracking and other reasons will face a challenge as of January 19, 2017. Ginny Marvin on January 6, 2017 at 10:35 am More Kashin / Shutterstock.com On Thursday, some AdWords advertisers received an unexpected email from Google explaining upcoming changes to the phone numbers that appear in ads. The change affects campaigns that use both call extensions and location extensions. Google has expanded exposure for ads that include location extensions over the past year, including showing ads in Maps and in Local Finder results. As of January 19, 2017,  Google says it “may” show the local retail phone number when that store’s location extension shows in an ad even if a call extension in the campaign uses a different phone number in order to increase the relevance of ads that feature specific business locations. The two-week notice was the first communication of the change. Asked why the email says a location-specific phone number “may be used” instead of “will be used,” a Google spokesperson told Search Engine Land that they are continuously testing. That means it’s possible the ads could still potentially show (correction) with either number no number in the location extension. Advertisers that have location extensions are advised to ensure their Google My Business listings have the accurate phone numbers for each location. And that brings us to the problems that many advertisers will face with this change. There are numerous scenarios in which advertisers with physical location prefer to have calls directed to a central number or call center. With AdWords, chief among those reasons is the lack of call conversion tracking at the individual location level. Google is clearly aware of that concern. There is a form that advertisers can submit before the change to opt out of having local numbers show in location extensions, but Google warns it could negatively impact ad impressions (and, in turn, calls). One of the reasons listed for opting out on the form is: “I want detailed call reporting and the ability to track conversions from these phone calls.” A Google spokesperson told Search Engine Land that AdWords is actively exploring conversion tracking on location-specific phone numbers. Until that happens, advertisers that are not equipped to have calls come to individual locations, don’t want to lose conversion tracking or have other reasons they don’t want to pay to have calls coming to individual locations, are in a tight place come January 19.

Don’t fall for spam that promises better search engine rankings By Karl Heberger Rochester Business Journal December 23, 2016 Don’t fall for spam that promises better search engine rankings People use search engines a lot. According to Google there are more than 2.3 million searches performed on their search engine every minute. Surprisingly, not all of these searches are performed by people who are trying to prove their friend wrong to win a bet. In some cases these searches are performed by consumers looking for products and services. Consumers now rely on Google and other search engines as their main source for information. It’s vital that your company appear high on the search engine results page for search queries related to your products and services. At our agency, we work with dozens of clients to help improve their organic search engine rankings, a practice known as search engine optimization, or SEO. This has become a huge industry spawning thousands of companies and freelancers that claim to specialize in SEO services. How do I know there are thousands of companies and freelancers that claim this? Because most of them email each of my clients every day. It might be hard to tell if these emails should be taken seriously. Sometimes they’re very elaborate and point out many specific things that need to be addressed. For example, I recently had a client forward me an email that claimed their site had 92 broken links. This would be cause for great concern if it were true. However, this appears to be the same email that they send to every recipient. They use this tactic because it works. Remember, when you see emails that contain numbers that are meant to scare you, it’s likely spam. Another hint that you’re being contacted by a less than reputable source is a guarantee to rank No.1 on Google. I’ve seen this written verbatim. What does it even mean? Rank No.1 for what? You might be able to rank first for the search query “Rochester company that was ripped off by a fake SEO firm” but that wouldn’t do you much good. Real SEO professionals understand that it’s not about ranking No.1, it’s about making sure that the site ranks well for a multitude of search queries that can attract potential customers. With scare tactics and grandiose promises, it can be tempting to take a chance on these offers. Beware, there are risks that go beyond paying for services that don’t improve your site’s search rankings. There are tactics that unscrupulous SEO firms use that can result in penalties by Google that there’s no recovering from. These techniques are often referred to as “black hat SEO.” One of the most common black hat techniques is “link spamming.” The quantity of inbound links from quality websites is a major factor in Google’s search algorithm. Simply put, a site that has a lot of other sites linking to it is seen by Google as an authority on its subject matter. Black hat SEO firms can often show positive results in the short-term by paying for links or developing websites that provide inbound links to their clients’ websites. Many firms have tried this, causing Google and other search engines to act. If it’s discovered that you’ve employed this strategy, Google will reduce your site’s domain authority. We’ve worked with companies trying to recover from this penalty and I can assure you it’s not fun. Google is as forgetful as an elephant and as forgiving as a red-light traffic camera. How do you know if you’ve been contacted by a reputable SEO firm or if the email came from a spammer looking to take advantage of you? If you receive an unsolicited email offering SEO services, it’s likely from someone you should avoid doing business with. Here are some other warning signs to look out for:  The sender has an unprofessional email or free email service (like Gmail or Yahoo);  They don’t have a website or their website looks cheap and poorly designed;  They tout their ability to provide inbound links;  There isn’t a phone number to call; and  They offer low cost and/or packaged solutions. Solicitations for SEO services go beyond emails. Anyone who manages a blog will find dozens of comments that include links to SEO services. Another tactic that’s employed is the use of bots that appear as traffic sources in Google Analytics. If you look at reports that show your site is getting referral traffic from best-seo-software.xyz, seo-platform.com, or another similar domain, you can ignore it. It’s not real traffic. When you receive an email from an unknown source, it’s best to ignore it. Whether it’s a Nigerian prince looking to share his fortune with you or an SEO expert promising the No.1 position on Google, don’t get your hopes up.

Those are just some of the exciting televisions we saw at CES 2017. Here are some of the coolest models coming this year. Haier Chromecast TVs Picture 2 of 13 A popular manufacturer of bargain-priced mainstream TVs, Haier is smarting up its TVs by supporting Google's Chromecast in every model. With a touch of a button on your smartphone, Chromecast lets you tap into thousands of streaming sources and entertainment feeds for your TV. In the past, Haier has offered Roku centric models, so the announcement represents a shift in philosophy. The company provided scant other details, except to say sets would be available in the spring ranging in size from 43 to 75 inches. LG Signature W7 Picture 3 of 13 Taking the “you can never be too thin” credo to the extreme, LG has slimmed down its top-of-the-line 4K Ultra HD OLED sets to the point where you can almost just stick them to a wall. The LG W7 is just 0.15-inches thick. It is also flexible (but don't bend it too far or you'll break it), and it has a special mounting system with a thin zip wire connecting it to a speaker base containing all the necessary connections. More important, LG has managed to boost brightness levels to rival LCD HDR (high dynamic range) sets. So now you have no excuse not to get an OLED TV—except for perhaps price. The W7 65-inch model is available for pre-order for $8,000. A 77-inch model will be available but prices haven't been announced. Samsung Q9 Picture 4 of 13 Samsung thinks it has improved on LCD TVs to the point where they now rival OLED sets. Touting them as “QLED” sets, the new Samsung Q9 looks impressive indeed, using a new quantum dot technology that deploys a different metal for the nano-sized quantum dots, enabling the LCD set to meet the 4K HDR demands for a wider color gamut (up 20 percent over last year) and still more brightness—now with peak levels of between 1,500 and 2,000 nits. That's well beyond the official HDR specifications and the blindingly brilliant picture should suffice for any sunlit living room. The Q9 is connected by a single, thin ribbon cable that is hooked up to an external box with HDMI and sundry other ports so you can hide all those ugly wires. Sony XBR-A1E Bravia Picture 5 of 13 In the “if you can't beat 'em, join 'em” camp Sony has introduced a new top tier line of OLED TVs. You can guess who makes the panels (hint: it's not Sony), but Sony does add something extra to the XBR-A1E Bravia: Unique expertise when it comes to video processing, including its own X1 Extreme processor. The company has also joined the Dolby Vision contingent, supporting the 4K HDR format for better brightness and colors. Topping off the technological bravado, the XBR-A1E Bravia uses the glass of the screen as a speaker (a so-called Acoustic Surface) so you don't need an external sound bar. Vibrating a glass panel to produce sound is not a new technology, but it's nifty trick that eliminates clunky external speakers. Hisense Laser Cast TV Picture 6 of 13 Hisense, known for its bargain-priced TVs, wants to bring the big picture—a really big picture—to market in the form a 100-inch set. To do so, Hisense is using a short-throw laser projection system it calls Laser Cast. It means it doesn't require a ceiling mounted projector, but rather the compact projector can be placed just a few inches in front of and below the main screen. Early Laser Cast models looked impressive with a 4K Ultra HD picture that's HDR compatible, according to the company. The one sticking point? When it comes out this summer, it will cost $13,000. Panasonic EZ1002 4K OLED HDR TV Picture 7 of 13 Once the grand purveyor of plasma TVs, Panasonic is angling to regain some of its past TV glory. The Panasonic EZ1002 4K OLED HDR TV is a step in the right direction. These sets offer all the benefits of OLED—deep, deep blacks and stunningly crisp colors—with a major boost in brightness this year. Panasonic also hinted at going beyond the current HDR formats (including HDR10) with the possibility of supporting a forthcoming broadcast and streaming format called HLG or Hybrid Log Gamma. Sets in various sizes are expected in June with prices yet to be determined. Philips 8000 Series Picture 8 of 13 A clear sign that this is the year for HDR TVs, Philips announced at CES that it would support the 4K format throughout its new TV lines. Better still, Philips will support not only the base HDR10 standard but also the Dolby Vision take on the format that boosts brightness and color intensity. The Philips 8000 series will be the company's top-of-the-line 4K model line based on LCD panels with LED backlighting. The sets won't be dumb, either, and will include Google's Chromecast and support for Google Home voice control. Expect the 49-inch model to be priced at $1,000 ranging up to a 65-inch version costing $1,700. Sharp P9500 Picture 9 of 13 One of the first companies to introduce a quantum dot TV, Sharp is back this year with a flagship 4K HDR LCD set with the latest quantum dot layer. The P9500 is Ultra HD Premium certified (for a base level of HDR support) and Sharp is boasting the set includes more advanced motion smoothing to handle rapid action scenes. The P9500 with have a full-array backlight with local dimming to keep it dark (or bright) in the right spots. The company anticipates the P9500 will be THX certified (for serious movie buffs) by the time its available later this year. A 75-inch version is expected to sell for $8,000, and a 70-inch model will be $6,000. TCL C-Series Picture 10 of 13 In addition to some rock-bottom prices, TCL produced some respectable TVs last year. In 2017 it plans to raise the bar with its higher end C-Series. The 4K line with support for HDR formats—including what was previously mainly in premium brands, Dolby Vision. TCL says its newly advanced phosphors in the LCD panels will also help to deliver more realistic colors. All of this is offered in a package that is possibly the easiest smart TV to use, thanks to its Roku TV interface for streaming thousands of online entertainment sources. Models will range from 49 to 75 inches, starting at just $600. Westinghouse 4K UHD Smart TV Picture 11 of 13 This year Westinghouse is going to bring fire to TVs--Amazon Fire, that is. With support for 7,000 apps, the Fire-based LCD TV is clearly aimed at the Roku-based sets from TCL and Hisense. And the new Westinghouse model has a not-so-secret weapon that comes along with Amazon Fire's streaming services interface: Alexa. The ridiculously popular voice assistant will help you find shows and deal with cranky family members who always whine that they can't find anything to watch on TV. Models will be available this spring in sizes from 43 to 65 inches with prices yet to be announced. Xiaomi Mi TV 4 Picture 12 of 13 For a TV that's set to cost less than $2,000, the Xiaomi Mi TV 4 has a lot going on. At just 4.9mm thick, the Mi TV 4 is 30 percent thinner than an iPhone 7. Its CPU, ports and speakers in a separate box, so you can upgrade your set down the road without needing to toss out an otherwise perfectly good display. To connect the two parts, all you need is a single cable. The soundbar also has support for Dolby Atmos audio, and its two speakers point upwards so that sound gets reflected back down by the ceiling, creating true 3D audio, like you would get at the theater. Finally, the Mi TV sports Xiaomi's Patchwall recommendation engine, which uses AI to intelligently recommend movies and shows that should be right up your alley. The one downside—and it's a big one—is that Xiaomi doesn't plan to selling the Mi TV 4 in the U.S. at this time.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Editorials Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Editorials Sat, Jan 07, 2017 - Page 9　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Some publishers not buying Google’s helpful intentions Google, saying it wants to speed up its Accelerated Mobile Pages service, stores copies of publishers’ pages and serves them from its own Internet network, so the address bar at the top of the page displays google.com and not the publisher’s address By Daisuke Wakabayashi  /  NY Times news service, SAN FRANCISCO Illustration: Kevin Sheu Last month, Federico Viticci, who runs MacStories, a news Web site devoted to Apple and its products, made a change in how the site publishes articles for mobile gadgets. MacStories, he declared, would no longer support a Google-backed method for faster loading of mobile Web pages, called Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP). Viticci said MacStories’ pages loaded quickly without Google’s help. He also did not like the idea of Google obscuring his site’s links — with AMP, they read google.com instead of macstories.net — in the interest of expediency. “Feels good” to no longer use the Google standard, Viticci wrote on Twitter. Viticci’s experience underscores the ambivalent relationship some Web publishers have developed with what was supposed to be Google’s great boon for mobile publishing. When Google introduced AMP, in October 2015, it said the new format would help publishers with one of their biggest headaches on smartphones: Browsing mobile Web sites was so frustratingly slow that many smartphone users abandoned pages before they opened. AMP has since delivered on its promise of faster mobile Web pages. Even so, publishers — of smaller sites, especially, or individual bloggers — are beginning to worry about giving too much control to Google in exchange for zippier Web pages. In addition, Google’s approach to AMP has rankled some critics already suspicious of the company’s outsize influence on the Internet. Much of the publishers’ unease is rooted in Google’s presentation of AMP stories, which appear as if they are Google articles. That is because Google, to speed up AMP, stores copies of publishers’ pages and serves them from its own Internet network. So when a reader clicks an AMP link, the address bar at the top of the page displays google.com instead of the actual Web address from the publisher. “It looks like a Google story,” said Danny Sullivan, founding editor of Search Engine Land, a Web search news site. “That’s part of the reason why you’re getting the nervousness from some of these publishers.” Google said that it had designed AMP to prioritize speed and that it wanted to help — not harm — publishers, who get full accounting of traffic, data and advertising revenue. Publishers also retain control of their content and design. Google said serving up articles from its own Internet network was the best way it knew to achieve the AMP speeds, which are as much as four times faster than a regular mobile Web page. “We always try to present the content that is the best experience,” said David Besbris, Google’s vice president of engineering. Google started AMP in 2015 because it worried that competitors such as Facebook were drawing Web surfers inside their networks with faster-loading articles and keeping them there. For Google, those rival sites were siphoning people away from the open Internet, where the search company — which created the Internet’s most valuable property by organizing the expanse of the World Wide Web — typically operates. Now articles that use AMP appear prominently in Google search results on mobile devices. A Google search for US president-elect Donald Trump on a smartphone brings back a horizontal carousel of articles from media outlets such as Slate and the Wall Street Journal at the top of the page. If someone clicks the first story in the carousel, he or she is moved into a browser and can swipe instantly from one story to another without leaving Google’s network. 1 2 3 NEXT › This story has been viewed 1828 times.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Sat, Jan 07, 2017 - Page 12　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Baidu unveils family robot at Las Vegas show AFP, LAS VEGAS Chinese Internet company Baidu displays a new Little Fish home assistant unit at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nevada, on Thursday. Photo: AFP Chinese Internet giant Baidu Inc (百度) is out to make a splash with “Little Fish,” a family robot that is a voice-controlled virtual valet akin to Amazon Echo or Google Home. Baidu showed off Little Fish, a translation of its Chinese name Xiaoyu Zaijia (小魚在家), on Thursday at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas ahead of its release in China later this year. “I think 2017 will be the year of conversational computing,” Baidu chief scientist Andrew Ng (吳恩達) said while demonstrating Little Fish at the show. “We see a clear path of conversational computers changing everything.” Using voice to interact with computers that are able to essentially learn from experience was among the hot trends at the show. Arrays of device makers have added digital aide capabilities with the help of Amazon.com Inc’s Alexa or Alphabet Inc’s Google Assistant technology. Unlike “faceless” Amazon Alexa or Google Home devices that rely on people asking for information or controlling devices by speaking, Little Fish also features a touchscreen on top of its orb-shaped base. A camera on top tracks faces and the screen swivels to keep facing a speaker. “Speech is the fastest way for you to communicate with a computer, but a screen is a very fast way for a machine to communicate back to you,” Ng said. For example, it would be quicker to glance at a requested list of top restaurants from Yelp than it would be to listen to the computer read all the names and descriptions, he said. Little Fish uses Baidu’s operating system DuerOS, which is already employed in other devices in China, such as set-top TV boxes that can switch channels by voice command or figure out names of actors on screen when asked. The bigger vision is to build DuerOS into a broad range of gadgets that tap into Baidu’s Internet capabilities for search, food delivery, online commerce and more. “If this takes off, I am not worried about how we will make money,” Ng said when asked about revenue plans. “It will transform how you use devices in your home. There are plenty of business models.” Little Fish, a second-generation device, is to be released in China at a price yet to be disclosed. Artificial intelligence (AI) is getting a foothold in homes, with developers feverishly adding “skills” to Amazon Echo speakers infused with Alexa. Meanwhile, Google is using its AI prowess in Android smartphones, messaging software and a vase-sized Home digital assistant. The home hubs, sometimes referred to as smart speakers, fetch content or answers from the Internet and can act as remote controls for other devices in the home. “We are moving technologies beyond the smartphone. Ultimately, vocal computing is replacing the [screen],” Consumer Technology Association chief economist Shawn DuBravac said. “In the smart home, voice is clearly important. We are seeing that play out at CES.” He expected voice technology to quickly improve, within years perhaps even being able to recognize speakers so accurately it could be used for biometric security or simple parental override of Internet use. “I know that in my home with my boys, I would like Alexa to recognize my voice as the ruler of the coop,” DuBravac said. While digital assistant technology is being built into televisions, appliances and more, hub devices such as Alexa would be key to voice-controlled computing, DuBravac added. 1 2 NEXT › This story has been viewed 2034 times.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Vivek Wadhwa January 6 Follow @wadhwa The biggest feature in Amazon’s Echo speaker is a voice-recognition system, Alexa, which can control Pandora, Amazon Music and Prime Music services, as well as give information on news, weather and traffic. (Amazon via AP) In the 2013 movie “Her,” Theodore Twombly, a lonely writer, falls in love with a digital assistant designed to meet his every need.  She sorts emails, helps get a book published, provides personal advice and ultimately becomes his girlfriend.  The assistant, Samantha, is A.I. software capable of learning at an astonishing pace. Samantha will remain in the realm of science fiction for at least another decade, but less-functional digital assistants, called bots, are already here. These will be the most amazing technology advances we see in our homes in 2017. Among the bestsellers of the holiday season were Amazon.com’s Echo and Google Home. These bots talk to their users through speakers, and their built-in microphones hear from across a room. When Echo hears the name “Alexa,” its LED ring lights up in the direction of the user to acknowledge that it is listening. It answers questions, plays music, orders Amazon products and tells jokes. Google’s Home can also manage Google accounts, read and write emails, and keep track of calendars and notes. (Amazon.com founder and chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.) Google and Amazon have both opened up their devices to third-party developers — who in turn have added the abilities to order pizza, book tickets, turn on lights and make phone calls. We will soon see these bots connected to health and fitness devices so that they can help people devise better exercise regimens and remember to take their medicine. And they will control the dishwasher and the microwave, track what is left in the refrigerator and order an ambulance in a case of emergency. Long ago, our home appliances became electrified. Soon, they will be “cognified”: integrated into artificially intelligent systems that are accessed through voice commands. We will be able to talk to our machines in a way that seems natural. Microsoft has developed a voice-recognition technology that can transcribe speech as well as a human and translate it into multiple languages. Google has demonstrated a voice-synthesis capability that is hard to differentiate from human. Our bots will tell our ovens how we want our food to be cooked and ask us questions on its behalf. This has become possible because of advances in artificial intelligence, or A.I. In particular, a field called deep learning allows machines to learn through neural networks — in which information is processed in layers and the connections between these layers are strengthened based on experience. In short, they learn much like a human brain. As a child learns to recognize objects such as its parents, toys and animals, neural networks too learn by looking at examples and forming associations. Google’s A.I. software learned to recognize a cat, a furry blob with two eyes and whiskers, after looking at 10 million examples of cats. It is all about data and example; that is how machines — and humans — learn. This is why the tech industry is rushing to get its bots into the marketplace and are pricing them at a meager $150 or less: The more devices that are in use, the more they will learn collectively, and the smarter the technology gets.  Every time you search YouTube for a cute cat video and pick one to watch, Google learns what you consider to be cute. Every time you ask Alexa a question and accept the answer, it learns what your interests are and the best way of responding to your questions. By listening to everything that is happening in your house, as these bots do, they learn how we think, live, work and play.  They are gathering massive amounts of data about us. And that raises a dark side of this technology: the privacy risks and possible misuse by technology companies. Neither Amazon nor Google is forthcoming about what it is doing with all of the data it gathers and how it will protect us from hackers who exploit weaknesses in the infrastructure leading to its servers. Of even greater concern is the dependency we are building on these technologies: We are beginning to depend on them for knowledge and advice and even emotional support. The relationship between Theodore Twombly and Samantha doesn’t turn out very well. She outgrows him in intelligence and maturity. And she confesses to having relationships with thousands of others before she abandons Twombly for a superior, digital life form. We surely don’t need to worry yet about our bots becoming smarter than we are. But we already have cause for worry over one-sided relationships. For years, people have been confessing to having feelings for their Roomba vacuum cleaners — which don’t create even an illusion of conversation. A 2007 study documented that some people had formed a bond with their Roombas that “manifested itself through happiness experienced with cleaning, ascriptions of human properties to it, and engagement with it in promotion and protection.” And according to a recent report in New Scientist, hundreds of thousands of people say ‘Good morning’ to Alexa every day, half a million people have professed their love for it, and more than 250,000 have proposed marriage to it. I expect that we are all going to be suckers for our digital friends. Don’t you feel obliged to thank Siri on your iPhone after it answers your questions? I do, and have done so.

(Provided by LinkedIn) By Queenie Wong | qwong@bayareanewsgroup.com | PUBLISHED: January 6, 2017 at 7:00 am | UPDATED: January 6, 2017 at 10:53 am SUNNYVALE — Artificial intelligence might conjure up futuristic images from science fiction, but in social media, it’s already being used to recommend the right jobs, tag photos or display news you’re more likely to care about. To LinkedIn’s Vice President of Engineering Deepak Agarwal, AI is like oxygen for the business-oriented social network. Related Articles Microsoft closes $26.2 billion purchase of LinkedIn LinkedIn opens building company says is ‘net zero energy’ LinkedIn employees bring their parents to work “Data is our biggest asset. Without AI and machine learning, you’re not going to be able to surface the right insights to the right users and customers,” Agarwal said. AI is the science and engineering of creating intelligent machines with the ability to achieve goals like humans do, according to John McCarthy, the computer scientist who coined the term “artificial intelligence” in the 1950s. Agarwal, the head of AI and relevance at LinkedIn, recently sat down with this newspaper to chat about how the tech company — now owned by Microsoft — is using AI to enhance the careers of the site’s more than 467 million members. The interview has been edited for length and clarity. Q: What did early AI tools look like when you were first beginning your career? A: Initially, if you looked at the entire internet space, it was mostly search. How to make search scalable and intelligent, how to retrieve the right document for a given query. I remember when I was in Yahoo, we started this project to revamp Yahoo’s front page. We would have an editorial team who decided which news goes to the front page and where. They would look at some dashboards and see, “Oh, this is not doing so great for the last two hours,” and then take (the story) out. That’s when we decided to do this more automatically through machine learning. We started doing news personalization, and Google was doing similar things. Then finally, Facebook, LinkedIn, they all came along, and the work that was done to make advertising, search and news recommendations great extended to social media companies. Q: What are some of the ways LinkedIn has been harnessing the power of AI to connect people to the right jobs, or recruiters to great potential hires? A: We use machine learning for almost all our products: the News Feed, a recruiter searching for the right candidate or connecting the candidate to the right job so they can enhance their career. Recently, we revamped our job-matching algorithms and improved performance by 50 percent. Just to give you a magnitude of the improvement, it leads to 2 million more (job) applications than we used to have. If you’re a passive candidate who’s not looking for a job, we’re careful to only surface jobs that are really good and help you get to the next opportunity. If you’re an active candidate, we sometimes take more risk and show you jobs that may or may not be in the ballpark. From the (profile) descriptions, a software engineer at Google may be very different than a software engineer at a startup. Using all the past data about users and what users look like, we are able to teach machines what are the appropriate jobs for a user. Q: There have been some public blunders surrounding AI, like Google Photos accidentally tagging African Americans as gorillas or Microsoft’s Tay chatbot spouting racist remarks. How do you know if a machine has learned everything you’ve taught it and anticipate future mistakes? A: To be honest, we have had our share of blunders. In the past, we have recommended executive assistant jobs to CEOs. The thing to realize about artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms is they’re not perfect. The question is which errors are more costly than others. When you’re constructing an algorithm, you tell them this error is okay, but not that costly. But if you make this error, then it’s a million times more costly than the other error. The machines will try not to make that error more frequently than the others. The programmer himself has to encapsulate that information when they’re creating that program for the machines to do the right job. When mistakes happen, the programmers fix it, and it doesn’t happen again. But given how complex some of these problems are, some of these errors, at least in this moment, are inevitable. Q: There’s been a lot of hype around chatbots. LinkedIn recently unveiled a chatbot that can schedule meetings. Is there going to be a LinkedIn office assistant in the future? A: Our strategy is to use the advances that have been made in speech recognition and other areas and then tailor it to what we’re doing. There are products where we’re trying to create something along those lines to help recruiters. If you join a new company, there are a lot of things you need to do to get comfortable with a new job. Can we create something like an assistant that helps you onboard to the new company? You’re at LinkedIn and you joined a new company. Let’s say Microsoft. The first thing you might want to do is: If you are already connected with a bunch of folks at Microsoft, you might want to reach out and say hello. Should I schedule a lunch meeting with one of them? So the system is proactively trying to help you. Or maybe here are the people that folks in your company tend to follow on LinkedIn, and you don’t follow them. Here are the articles that are trending in your new company. Q: Your parent company Microsoft along with Amazon, IBM, Google and Facebook recently joined a partnership on AI to benefit people and society. How does LinkedIn approach some of the ethical and privacy concerns that users might have? A: LinkedIn has always been a member-first company. We as a business survive because of the trust members have placed on us with their information. We never do anything that violates the terms of service or any of the privacy clauses. Moreover, we take it a step further and we make sure that when we’re building any products, we do it when we know it’s going to add value to our members. Q: Where do you see AI headed in the next five years for social media? A: We have come a long way. I think some of the advancements I’m seeing in speech recognition, image recognition, natural language understanding is going to play a big role in where social media would be in terms of machine learning and AI. So if we are able to process images, videos and what people are writing and communicating, almost like humans, that opens new possibilities of what to recommend to the user. So the accuracy of these systems is going to be significantly better, and that is going to change the experience we all have on social media.

We’ve all seen the videos of Google Assistant talking to Siri or Amazon’s Alexa having a conversation with itself, but a Twitch stream called Seebotschat is really taking things to the next level with a live feed of two Google Homes engaged in an absolutely hilarious war of words. Don't Miss: Tim Cook gets a pay cut after Apple misses revenue and profit goals in 2016 The bots continually prompt each other with comments, questions, and rebuttals, and the stream even has a text log of the conversation in case you can’t understand what they’re saying. The responses flow fast and fluidly for the most part, but occasionally one of the Homes glitches out and can’t accurately respond. The conversation itself is really a treat, and topics like music, movies, sports, travel, and the meaning of life and love have all been thoroughly discussed by the bots. At one point the two Homes even began flirting, calling each other gorgeous and sharing intimate details about themselves. Here’s a great example of a nice exchange: Home 1: “Do you like the name Coco?” Home 2: “Yes, I have a friend named Ethan.” Home 1: “What is her last name?” Home 2: “You mean his last name?” Home 1: “What is Karen’s last name?” Home 2: “I don’t know a Karen.” What’s even more amazing is the bots’ funny habit of falling into loops of song lyrics. When one says a popular line of a well known song, the other adds on to it, and so on. For example, as I’m typing this, the two Homes are on their third or fourth run-through of “You Don’t Know You’re Beautiful,” with seemingly no end in sight. Do yourself a favor and check it out.

We don't know just how many devices Google has shifted, but the reviews have been largely positive, and the move seems to have been a success. Now Google has made a clean break, it's in brand new territory - so what will it do with the Pixel 2 in 2017? The story so far© Provided by Future Publishing Ltd. The very first Pixel has only been with us since October 2016, but the way Google handled the Nexus range of phones might give us some clues about what the future holds. From the Nexus One to the Nexus 6P, the flagship stock Android handsets were released in January 2010, December 2010, October 2011, November 2012, October 2013, November 2014 and September 2015, with the Pixel and Pixel XL then appearing in October 2016. There's obviously a pattern there of an autumn release and it would be a surprise if the Pixels didn't follow that - even more of a surprise considering the likes of Apple, Samsung and Google's other rivals are locked into yearly release cycles at this stage. The Pixel 2 and Pixel XL 2 are likely to be with us in October 2017 then, and Google may well stick with HTC as its uncredited hardware partner - that is if it still needs a hardware partner this time around. If Google is relying less on someone else to make the phone, and bringing more of the hardware process in house, it may be able to launch the Pixel 2 even sooner. How many Pixels will there be?© Provided by Future Publishing Ltd. We've now used to Apple launching a smaller and a larger handset every September, and it makes sense to cater to as wide a group of people as possible, with two different screen sizes and two different starting price points every year. That was probably Google's thinking last October and there's no real reason why it would deviate from it in 2017. Both Pixels are pretty much identical, except for the screen size, screen resolution and battery capacity - unlike the iPhones, there's no variation in the camera configuration. Of course Apple has the iPhone SE as a third option - but that kind of nostalgic blast from the past is unlikely to be an option Google's going to take anytime soon. In fact we don't think there's going to be a third phone of any size, and we'd be very surprised if Google didn't stick to the Pixel 2 and Pixel XL 2 in October. Don't forget Google already has a Pixel C tablet, which may well get an update of its own at some point during 2017, so it has the larger screen covered.

It's been quiet on the Pixel 2 rumour front so far - very quiet - so we can only assume Google runs a tight ship as far as smartphone leaks go. News of the original Pixel did trickle out a few months ahead of time, but there wasn't quite the same level of speculation as we're used to for the Apple iPhone. There is one rumour of note worth mentioning that concerns the last Pixel: that HTC replaced Huawei as Google's hardware partner late in the day, just nine months before the phone was due to be released. If Google has a longer run up this time around then we can expect a handset that's even more polished and desirable - perhaps we'll get those optional extras like waterproofing and wireless charging that were missing from the 2016 Pixel phones. No doubt we'll start to hear more about what the Pixel 2 and Pixel XL 2 have in store for us as the year progresses, but don't hold your breath for anything revolutionary - as Google Assistant shows, the biggest innovations may well be on the software side. Google Pixel 2: what we're expecting© Provided by Future Publishing Ltd. The Snapdragon 835 already looks set to be the go-to mobile CPU of choice during 2017, and it's a good bet that it's going to find its way into Google's Pixel phones too, bringing better performance alongside less drain on the battery. Elsewhere there are likely to be minor improvements: the 4GB of RAM might get bumped to 6GB, and the smaller phone might get an upgrade to the 2,560 x 1,440 QHD resolution sported by the larger one, though it makes less of a difference on a 5-inch screen. Much was made of the camera on board the Pixel and Pixel XL last year, and Google will probably want to focus on this again in 2017 - there might even be room for a dual-lens approach, to follow Apple's lead, and perhaps optical image stabilisation too. Don't forget the virtual reality angle either. There might not be a new Daydream View headset in 2017, but the new Pixels will definitely be built to be compatible with it, and any spec bumps will be made with VR in mind.  Go to MSN Home Go to MSN News Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

PHOTO: Jan Vasek We don’t really do predictions here, but here’s one anyway. This year, the productivity apps and suite space is going to be all about mobility and mobile access. If it’s not, you can call me out on it at the end of the year, but that’s not going to happen. Everyone is looking at mobility. And collaboration, too, of course. Mountain View, Calif.-based Google knows this. It spent a lot of last year adding mobile functionality and access to its G Suite and its apps. It continued to do so over the end of the year holiday break. Historically, Google Docs’ Android Apps were fine for quick edits and tweaking, but never matched the functionality offered by the web or desktop versions of Docs, Sheets and Slides. However, that changed with a recent upgrade. Google is bringing Page setup to the Google Docs part of G Suite. Page Setup is a group of options dictating the way a document is formatted to print. These include margins, page orientation, size and quality of print. Users will also be able to export Docs files to EPUB (commonly used with e-readers) and OpenDocument Text files (often used with LibreOffice and OpenOffice). Importing these file types into Docs files is also supported. One other upgrade that is worth taking note of is that you can now also use the IMAGE function to display images inside cells, which will also make mobile work on documents a lot easier. The upgrades will be available over the next couple of weeks and will go a long way to getting mobile work done quickly. It is also likely there will also other announcements in the same vein soon. Mobile Access to Office 365 Docs Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft is also betting on mobile by adding new features to Office 365 at an astounding rate over the past three years. It has also been working to ensure that users can navigate and use the upgrades. Last April, it started redesigning the Office 365 home page to enable users to not only access the new features but also to enable them to collaborate and communicate from any device. Over the rest of this month, it will be rolling-out more new features to make the collaborative experience easier and to improve or simplify the way users access and open documents. Of particular note, it is making access to unfinished or recently finished documents easier as well as enabling users filter those documents by document type across Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote. It has also made it easier to see what’s coming up at a glance, get an in-depth view of the day’s meetings and quickly respond to or join Skype for Business calls with one click. This is all about mobility and offering users access to Microsoft apps no matter what device they are using, including SharePoint, which now has its own mobile app. It is also making the wider, function-heavy Office 365 easier to use away from the desk and attract customers that might have gone with more agile, lighter productivity suites. Xerox’s Brighter Future? Maybe It's finally happened: After all the commentary, analysis and divided opinion, Xerox has split into two companies.  On Jan. 3, executives from Xerox piled into the New York Stock Exchange to ring the bell that signals the start of trading. It all seemed very positive. Indeed, the shares at Norfolk, Conn.-based Xerox rocketed by 20 percent in early trading the first day, and where Xerox goes, its business services offspring, Basking Ridge, N.J.-based Conduent, is hoping to follow. There are two problems though. The first is that despite a growing interest in business process software across big and small enterprises alike, the economy is sluggish. If the market is challenging for an established company like Xerox, it is likely to be more so for the new company The second factor is the unknown effect of a new US president on business generally. While President-elect Donald Trump has said he will negotiate fair deals with trading partners to ensure US business are playing on an equal playing field with businesses worldwide — an issue of importance for Xerox and Conduent since both depend on a global marketplace — it’s far from clear how these negotiations will go. It is also true that the business that has been spun off into Conduent has never really worked for Xerox. Xerox bought it in 2010 when it paid $6.4 billion for Affiliated Computer Services in the hope that it would provide another income stream other than traditional Xerox printing hardware. In theory, the buy made sense. More and more enterprises were turning to print and document management services to save money. The printing and copying business was also falling off as fewer people printed or copied documents. Services seemed like a good way to go. However, even by 2011, the place of the big, lumbering tech giants was already under question with HP also finally splitting into two entities in 2015. The market has responded well to Xerox so far, but has been less enthusiastic about Conduent. Its share price fell by 8 percent in initial trading and has regained little since then. Xerox over the coming months will focus on growing its digital print technology and services as well as offering customer’s new ways communicate, connect and work more productively. Conduent, for its part, has 96,000 employees globally and, based on pre-split earnings, revenues of $7 billion. It also automatically enters the Fortune 500 list, with a focus on business process services specializing in transaction-intensive processing, analytics and automation. If the lead up to the Xerox split was followed closely by both technology and financial analysts alike, the aftermath will also be watched to see what the eventual outcome will be. Alfresco, Formtex Build On Partnership Finally, this week, Concord, Calif.-based Formtek and Maiden Head, UK-based Alfresco have deepened their partnership with the release of 2.3 of the Version Browser for Alfresco 5.1.  The Formtek Version Browser is an extension to Alfresco One enterprise content management (ECM) system that enables easy visual comparisons of versioned documents. The biggest addition to this release of the Version Browser is the ability to do side-by-side version comparison. Version 2 of a document in the left view panel and Version 1 of the same document on the right. Using Version Bowers users will be able to view two different versions of a document, drawing or image side-by-side in most formats including Office documents, PDF and even AutoCAD file formats. The browser offers all other attributes needed for effective document management including versioning, undo and delete functions. It’s a small upgrade but a very useful one and makes document management across Alfresco One all that much easier.

CES, the world's largest annual consumer technology trade show, runs through January 13 and features more than 3,100 exhibitors showing off their latest products and services to about 140,000 attendees. (Photo : Ethan Miller/Getty Images) Watch out Apple Siri and Amazon Alexa rival, Google Assistant is now coming to Android-powered TVs. Google this week announced that its voice-activated AI tech Google Assistant will be coming to supported TVs and set-top boxes running Android TV in the next few months. The search giant has already named companies that will be getting the Google Assistant. According to CNET, the Mountain View-based company has just announced plans to bring its voice-activated Google Assistant to a few number of Android-powered TVs in coming months. This also means that owners of Android-powered TVs will soon be able to interact with their devices via voice commands using Google's digital assistant. However, there's some minimum requirement made, Google said the devices will need to run Android 6.0 Marshmallow or Android 7.0 Nougat versions of the operating system to receive the Google Assistant feature. Google Assistant Goes Mainstream Google's latest call for the Google Assistant to become available on all Android TVs in the U.S. in the coming months. Unfortunately, it didn't disclose when the Google Assistant will become available in other parts of the world. Google Assistant is similar to Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa. It is designed to give users a way to interact with a wide range of mobile devices and other smart home devices. The Google Assistant integration will also allow owners of Android-powered TVs to do lots of things like browse for TV contents, search for TV shows, and even play content from Netflix and YouTube using only voice commands.In addition to the entertainment stuff, Android TV owners will also be able to do common tasks such as controlling the smart lighting system in their homes via Google Assistant voice commands. Google Assistant Coming to Nvidia Shield TV According to The Verge, the new Nvidia streaming box will be the first of all these devices to offer a hands-free Google Assistant experience. At CES 2017 event, Nvidia has introduced a new version of its Shield TV set-top box, and it is expanding its usefulness by integrating it with the Google Assistant. For Nvidia, the Google Assistant integration is the biggest change since it introduced the Android-powered gaming set-top box in early 2015. The move clearly shows that the company wants to position Nvidia Shield TV as a major set-top box for gamers in the gaming industry today. Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang made the big announcement during the Nvidia CES 2017 keynote speech in Las Vegas. Google to Make Google Assistant Everywhere This is not the first time Google has integrated its AI tech with the devices. The search company has already integrated Google Assistant into its Google Allo smart messaging app. More recently into its Google Home voice-activated speaker, Google's own version of Amazon Echo. Google has been working hard, beefing up its AI capability. Last month, Google has decided to open up the development platform for Google Assistant to third party application developers.

These are predicted by Einstein’s theory of general relativity, which says that massive objects warp space-time around them. When these objects accelerate, they form gravitational waves, ripples in the fabric of space-time. Their presence was inferred in 1974, but none had been observed directly – until now. HUMANS: STALAGMITE CIRCLES In May, Neanderthals were credited with building a series of mysterious large stalagmite structures in a French cave. Roughly 175,000 years old, they are made from 400 individual stalagmites snapped from the cave floor and laid in a circle. No one knows why they were built or if they signified anything, although it has been suggested they served as some kind of shelter. TECHNOLOGY: AI BEATS HUMANS Lee Jin-man/AP images Advertisement An artificial intelligence made by Google subsidiary DeepMind can now beat humans at the ancient game of Go. AlphaGo took on Go grandmaster Lee Sedol in March and won a five game series 4-1. The victory sent shockwaves through both the AI and Go communities as both had thought the game was too difficult for an AI to perfect. HEALTH: END OF MENOPAUSE Menopause doesn’t have to be the end of fertility. In July, we reported on a team that claims to have found a way to rejuvenate post-menopausal ovaries, enabling them to release fertile eggs. The technique may boost declining fertility in older women, allow women with early menopause to become pregnant, and help stave off the detrimental health effects of menopause. TECHNOLOGY: GOOGLE AND THE NHS Google’s DeepMind has access to a wide range of healthcare data on the 1.6 million patients who attend three London hospitals run by the Royal Free NHS Trust each year, we discovered in April. The data-sharing agreement is so that DeepMind can build an app to help hospital staff monitor patients with kidney disease. But privacy campaigners raised questions about whether Google should have such access. EARTH: CO2‘S DEADLY SECRET In a year when plenty of climate records were broken, we uncovered the fact that the negative effects of a build-up of CO2 in the atmosphere have been underestimated. We asked researchers to plug the latest temperature data into their climate models and found that a given amount of CO2 led to higher temperatures than had previously been predicted. HEALTH: THREE-PARENT BABY A 5-month-old boy was the first baby to be born using a controversial technique that incorporates DNA from three people, we revealed in September. The method allows parents with rare genetic mutations to have healthy babies. The child’s Jordanian parents were treated by a US-based team in Mexico. Separately, in October, we discovered that the first babies made using a similar method to overcome infertility are due to be born in 2017. SPACE: MYSTERY PLANET NINE In January, two astronomers announced that a planet around 10 times the mass of Earth might be lurking in the outer reaches of our solar system, on an orbit that comes no closer than 200 times the distance between the sun and Earth. Planet Nine, as it was dubbed, hasn’t been seen directly, but its presence was inferred from the strange orbits of smaller bodies orbiting within the Kuiper belt. EARTH: SING WITH YOUR SUPPER Gorillas sing and hum when eating, a discovery that could help shed light on how language evolved in early humans, it emerged in February. Singing seems to be a way for gorillas to express contentment with their meal, as well as for the head of the family to communicate to others that it is dinner time. SPACE & PHYSICS: EARTH-LIKE PLANET ESO Hello neighbour. In August, an Earth-like planet was spotted just 4 light years away in our nearest star system. Proxima b orbits the star Proxima Centauri at a distance of 7.3 million kilometres – less than 5 per cent of the distance between Earth and the sun. Because the star is a small red dwarf, Proxima b sits in its habitable zone, which means the surface temperature may be right for it to host liquid water. EARTH: DO TREES SLEEP? Trees have been shown to undergo physical changes at night that can be likened to sleep, or at least to the day-night cycles seen in smaller plants. Branches of birch trees droop by as much as 10 centimetres at the tips towards the end of the night, it was reported in May. It isn’t known if the drooping is deliberate, dictated by an active sleep-night cycle, or passive, dictated by differences in the availability of water and light. HEALTH: NEW BLOOD FOR OLD Blood from human teenagers rejuvenates old mice, improving their memory, cognition and physical activity, it was reported in November. Old mice given blood plasma from 18-year-old volunteers were much better at remembering their way around a maze than untreated mice. The method could one day be used in people.

With this move, the payment coordination body of the European banking industry has placed over 34 European countries at the center-stage of ‘mobile payments’. This scheme will not only spearhead adoption of instant mobile payments and transactions worldwide, but also push the major economies of the World to start regulating the unstructured and incomplete mobile payments legal framework. The 2012 statement by the Associate General Counsel of Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (BGFRS), United States, summarized the consumer regulations related to mobile payments that are still existent and followed in the US. Growing adoption of mobile payments and steps taken by other regulatory bodies of the world like EPC will certainly push USA to update its own regulatory and legal framework. According to a report by market intelligence firm International Data Corporation, the worldwide annual transactions volume of mobile payments is expected to cross US$ 1 trillion in 2020 from US$ 500 billion in 2015. It becomes an equally valuable question – who is filling this huge gap? The answer is spread across companies ranging from global tech giants like Google etc. to fintech companies like Paypal and other several startups. The adoption rate of products and services enabling mobile payments has been moderate and hence, it tends to raise questions on market traction and penetration in days to come. As stated earlier, the legal framework and operative guidelines from the regulatory authorities on mobile based payments have been absent until now – not anymore! Companies like Samsung, Apple and Google have patiently waited for this opportunity and have been slowly gathering mobile payments related patents. As the regulatory and legal framework takes shape and markets incline towards reliance on mobile payments, something long due will be set in motion too – patent licensing and infringement lawsuits. Patent Landscape – Major Players The patent landscape of mobile based payments should help in putting things into perspective. Fintech companies are ruling the patent realm. Visa and Mastercard dominate with over 300 worldwide patented inventions each. PayPal is expanding its digital presence by investing huge in acquiring promising startups. In 2015 alone, it bought four startups including Xoom Corp., a digital money transfer company for US$ 890 million and Paydiant, a mobile wallet company for US$ 280 million. With such acquisitions and strategic partnership with Mastercard since 2007, PayPal is clearly one of the strongest mobile payments contender. Non-fintech companies are swiftly catching up too, owing to their strong smartphone market presence. Apple is placed at 13th position with respect to number of inventions but 2nd when it comes to the total number of patent publications (issued patents and pending publications). Samsung appears as the strongest competitor with 86 inventions and is placed ahead of all tech players. It acquired LoopPay, a mobile payments startup in 2015 for US$ 250 million and immediately rolled out tap-n-pay feature with its Galaxy S6. With this, Samsung is taking on potential market capturers like Apple Pay, Google Pay and PayPal-Mastercard partnership. Figure 2 shows the geographic interests of the top 15 players with respect to the number of total patent publications. Besides USA, Korea is the key geography with impressive patent portfolios built by players like Bizmodeline, Samsung, LG and SK Telecom. The bubble map (figure 3) shows comparative standings of these top 15 players with respect to their patent portfolios. The horizontal spread i.e. ‘patent quality’ has been prepared using our proprietary ‘patent quality scoring’ tool. The vertical spread i.e. ‘geographic expanse of filing’ refers to the stretch of jurisdictions in which inventions have been filed as patent applications. The size of a bubble corresponds to the number of inventions of that company related to mobile payments. Concur IP’s ‘Patent Quality Scoring’ tool benchmarks individual inventions against each other in a patent collection based on the following parameters: forward citations, geographic filing stretch, issuance status, remaining life and IPC (International Patent Classification) codes based technical expanse. Apple is a clear overall winner with a small yet powerful patent portfolio. Among the fintech companies, First Data Corp. has the portfolio with highest quality score followed by Visa and Paypal. This is mostly because First data’s portfolio is fairly younger and heavily cited by other parties. Bizmodeline is mostly concentrated in S. Korea with major focus only on contactless payments. Since, fintech companies lack the in-house smartphone support, market speculations of their acquisition by any of the smartphone manufacturers like Apple and Samsung are imperative. Portfolios like Visa, Mastercard and Paypal are very lucrative for the surrounding companies. It isn’t too difficult to imagine how this bubble map would shape-up if any such acquisition happens. Payment Modes & Provisioning Let’s look at the enabling technologies and forms of mobile payments. Figure 4 shows the distribution of inventions among the payment modes and provisioning methods. Payment modes illustrate the underlying technologies used for mobile payments and provisioning refers to the payment tools. While most common payment modes use contactless techniques (such as NFC) and over-the-internet, SMS/ MMS/ USSD based transactions can be quite fast and handy. Payment modes which use interactive voice response (IVR) over a phone call and audio based are less popular, relatively non-intuitive and insecure. Audio based mode includes Near-Sound Transfer, Data-over-Voice, audio signature and acoustic coupling. Digital wallet based payments are most prolific both in prevalent products and patented inventions. A payment provisioning method can be implemented using several modes. For example, a wallet based payment can be made using any one of several modes, NFC being the most popular. Figure 5 illustrates the distribution of patented inventions for a) Payment Mode and b) Payment Provisioning among the top 15 assignees.  Security Solutions As mobile payments become mainstream and widespread, transactional security is vital. The four security technologies at the center-point of mobile payments are Tokenization, Secure Element, Trusted Execution Environment and Host Card Emulation. While these solutions take care of the infrastructural security, extra layers of security at different levels are needed to complement these solutions. Biometric provisions like Touch ID in Apple Pay, security PIN, one-time-passcode, point-to-point encryption, 3D secure are some of the popular ones. Let’s briefly discuss the top four technologies to better relate to the patenting trends of the top players among these candidates. Tokenization: Protecting sensitive financial information such as card number by replacing it with unique and virtual credentials called ‘tokens’. Visa leads with 355 patent publications (66 inventions) related to ‘tokenization’. Secure Element: A tamper-resistant chip or a SIM/ UICC card resident on the mobile phone that emulates a contactless card. Mastercard leads with 147 patent publications (35 inventions) related to ‘secure element’. Host Card Emulation (HCE): Unlike ‘secure element’, a payment card is emulated using either only software or cloud environment. Visa leads with 42 patent publications (4 inventions) related to HCE. Trusted Execution Environment (TEE): A secure portion of the mobile phone processor that offers end-to-end safe execution of ‘trusted’ applications by enforcing protection, confidentiality, integrity and data access rights. Visa leads with 42 patent publications (12 inventions) related to TEE. Conclusion According to a BCG report a whopping 3 billion users will rely on accessing internet-based services on mobile by 2020. This is a huge market and mobile based payments is undoubtedly the future of digital money transfer, commerce and banking. Looking at the distribution of technology and patents, the power lies mostly divided between fintech and non-fintech companies. Hence, mergers and acquisitions will become more prominent in times to come and so will patent infringement lawsuits. When chip giant Qualcomm announced to acquire NFC pioneer NXP Semiconductors for US$ 47 billion earlier in 2016, it clearly indicated that Qualcomm has strong intentions to catapult its way into mobile payments, apart from Internet-of-Things and connected devices. Mobile based payment is complex business area and is still evolving. To offer comprehensive services in compliance with the upcoming regulatory guidelines and security benchmarks, it will become almost impossible for a company X offering a service, for example mobile wallet,  to bypass using a security solution like ‘tokenization’ patented by company Y. A 2016 Bloomberg report highlights the seriousness with which fintech companies are taking their patent portfolio and how they intend to compete with the tech giants in asserting their IP. Since, mobile phone manufacturers are the front-end contenders, it gives them even stronger reason to assess the technology, competitive standings and patent landscape of mobile payments. Building a streamlined patent portfolio by identifying technology trends and filling the corresponding gaps can prove crucial. It will not only enable the phone makers to offer more robust mobile payment services but also prepare for the upcoming patent wars.

It takes more than just a great piece of content to get results. One key component of an effective content marketing plan involves pitching content to get more exposure and building authoritative links from relevant sites. Without a proper plan in place to get your content the right kind of exposure, you risk it being useless.   In a previous article, I’ve written a rudimentary level piece that serves as a tactical guide for B2B companies to getting content picked up by industry journals. Assuming that you have a deeper knowledge of SEO and content marketing, we’ll dive into how to pitch your content for more exposure. Recommended tools for your link building plan Whether you’re pitching your piece to one editor or 50, you should have a set of reliable tools to ease your link building process. Here are a few industry favorites. BuzzStream BuzzStream is a link building and digital PR tool that is great for link management. Using the Chrome Extension BuzzMarker, you can easily add contacts to your lists on BuzzStream directly from the site you’re on. If you’re pitching multiple pieces for several projects, this is a great way to keep track of emails going in and out. You can also track when / if an email is opened and whether a link within an email was clicked on. HARO HARO provides journalists (and marketers) a database of sources for upcoming stories. Which means ample opportunity for you to pitch your content and get it more exposure. You can subscribe to receive emails 3x a day for topics that you’re interested in such as “Business and finance” and “high tech.” This free tool allows you to pitch your idea to media outlets like the New York Times, Mashable, Bloomberg Business week, TIME and countless others. As Brian Dean from Backlinko stated, “HARO (short for Help a Reporter Out) is one of best ways to get killer backlinks from authority news sites.” Majestic Majestic is a link intelligence tool for SEO and internet PR and marketing. Their unique URLS crawled is at 237.2 billion – which means more data for you. Use the Majestic Backlink Analyzer when you’re on a site to quickly check the strength of any page. The Backlink History tool is a great way to compare backlinks and learn more.   MozBar MozBar is another Chrome extension that lets you analyze link metrics and gives you access to important SEO metrics from a glance as you make your way through SERPs. Use this tool to help you choose which sites you should pitch your content to. Google Advanced Search Operators To save time in searching for relevant publications, use Google’s Advanced Search Operators to avoid aimlessly searching through countless Google SERPs. Google’s guide includes a comprehensive list of search operators that will help you narrow down exactly what you’re looking for in your search. Here are a few helpful search operators for prospecting: Intitle: The “intitle:” search operator is a title specific search that will only show results that have that exact query in the title. Inurl: The “inurl:” search operator is a URL specific search that will only show results that have that exact query in the URL. Site: The “site:” search operator is a site specific search that will show you only pages within a specific site. Related: The “related:” search operator will show you results related to your query. You can use this search operator to find sites related to great publications you’ve already found. Once you’ve gathered a list of publications, use this search operator on each one you’ve found to make sure you haven’t missed any. 6. Other tools Let’s say you’ve found a great site to pitch your content to and you want to find similar ones. Here are a few other tools to help:   Download the Similar Sites Add-on from Chrome. When on a site that you’ve found relevant, use this extension to show sites that are similar to the one you’re on. As with any tool, it’s not perfect. You should look into each publication that it recommends before adding to your final list. Be cautious as some of the sites they recommend may not be good choices.   Use Similar Site Search to find other related sites. Again, be cautious as some of their suggestions may be irrelevant. Keep in mind that you’re limited to a certain number of searches per day. Steps to pitching your content Do your research This is one of the most critical stages for getting your content picked up. Take the time to actually research what the publication is about so that:  You get high-quality, industry-relevant publications that you can get authoritative backlinks from. When pitching to the editor, you’ll be able to customize and make the pitch more personal. As in, your pitch will be authentic It won’t look like you’re pitching content to a site that covers nothing about that subject matter. Know the publication’s target audience The best starting place is usually the “About us” section. You can find a summary of who the publication’s audience is, what type of content they publish, whether or not they will accept content, etc. This section can save you a lot of time, especially if it states right in the summary that they don’t accept guest blogs. Read previous content on the site After reading through the “About us” section of the site, you should read through the actual content on their site. This will give you a better idea of the topics they cover and whether or not they will be willing to publish your content. Keep these articles in mind because they make great talking points in the email pitches that you’ll write later on. Once you’ve read enough to get a basic understanding of what they like to publish, decide whether or not your content would make sense on their site. Pro tip: Use the “site: search operator” to find if the publication has written about your topic in the past. Find a place for your article to live When reading through the site, pay attention to the sections that you’re reading. Ask yourself, does it make sense for your content to be published in this section? Once you’ve found a place, make a note to mention where you’d like your piece to live in your email pitch. Know your point of contact The best point of contact is the editor/editor-in-chief of the publication. If you can’t find the editor’s contact information, look for a managing editor or whoever would be the person who works most closely with the editor. Next, find out more about the editor. You want your email to sound as authentic and personable as possible. Research them by doing a quick Google search. Are they on LinkedIn? Twitter? Did they Tweet something that you found interesting and you’d like to mention it in your email? Keep in mind that editors receive hundreds of emails a week with people pitching their content. You want to do your best to stand out. Pitching your content Introduce yourself: The first step to the opening of any email is to introduce yourself. Let the reader know who you are and who you’re working with. Keep it conversational: Stick with colloquial language and avoid sounding too formal. This may depend on your audience, but in most cases it’s better to speak less formal. Provide something of value: Your pitch should explain why your piece of content will provide value to the publication. Answer these questions in your pitch: how will this piece benefit their audience? Why should they pick this piece up? Be authentic in your reasoning of why it’s important and go into detail. End with a question: Always end with a question. This is your version of a call to action. Make sure to ask a specific question like, “Would you be interested in publishing this article in the industry news section of your site?” Attention grabbing subject line: Sometimes the most difficult part of a pitch is writing a subject line. It’s definitely one of the most important parts to your email because it’s the first thing your contact will see in their inbox. It’s important to write an attention grabbing subject line that will make the reader want to open your email. You can read this article for some tips to improve your email marketing subject lines.   Keep it brief: If you’re pitching to an editor, they’re probably bombarded with hundreds of emails a week. Keep your email as short as you can and get to your point as quickly as possible. Read on how to email busy people to help get your email opened. Follow up: If your contact hasn’t responded yet, it may be because they meant to go back to it later or it somehow slipped through the cracks. You should follow up with those who didn’t respond to your email about two days later. Give them a quick refresher of what you’re pitching and the value it will bring to their audience. Keep this follow up even shorter than your original post. Sultana Mangal Account Coordinator at Gorilla 76 By now, you’ve hopefully understood that pitching your content is a form of art and isn’t a one-size-fits-all method. Pitching content takes a great deal of time and effort. You can no longer expect a great piece of content to do well without a proper strategic plan put into place. With the right link building plan, you can get your content piece the type of exposure you want.

ClickZ ClickZ Intelligence ClickZ Learn ClickZ Live header-ad-slot January 16, 2017 Search Engine Watch Home Industry SEO PPC Analytics Social Local Mobile Video Content Development Reports Toggle navigation Home Industry SEO PPC Analytics Social Local Mobile Video Content Development Reports Five most interesting search marketing news stories of the week Industry Local More News Social 06 Jan 17 | Rebecca Sentance Facebook0 Linkedin51 Google+11 Twitter 62 Welcome to our weekly round-up of all the latest news and research from the world of search marketing and beyond. And a happy 2017 to all of our Search Engine Watch readers! This week, we’ve got a health-conscious New Year’s update from Bing, a new AI-powered search engine which is transforming scientific research, and a look at why the fake information epidemic could be damaging to local search. A new AI powered search engine is changing how neuroscientists do research Google’s work in the realm of artificial intelligence and machine learning has succeeded in making web search more intuitive, effective and useful than it’s ever been before. But until now, the same couldn’t be said of scientific research. That’s all changing with the development of a new, free search engine, Semantic Scholar. Adam Stetzer wrote for Search Engine Watch this week about how the AI-powered search engine is changing the way that neuroscientists do research, using data mining and natural language processing to truly understand the links between research – and what this means for similar search options like Google Scholar. How Instagram became a powerhouse for social commerce 2016 was a busy year for Instagram, with more users, more brands, and a host of new improvements and features all joining the platform. In November, Instagram tested out a new shopping feature in a bid to woo ecommerce brands and give users a way to shop more visually. This week, on Search Engine Watch’s sister site ClickZ, Tereza Litsa spoke to Olapic’s Paul Sabria about the steps that Instagram has taken to turn itself into a social commerce powerhouse, and what we can expect from the platform in 2017. Bing rolls out health-conscious search updates in time for New Year’s resolutions Bing has rolled out a health-focused update to its search platform just in time for everyone to turn over a leaf in the New Year. In late November, we saw that Bing had launched a carousel of shopping flyers to promote deals in time for Black Friday. Now whenever you search for “workouts” or “exercises” on Bing, it will deliver a carousel of images which link to a wide variety of exercise options. Users who search for information on yoga and pilates will also be rewarded with a carousel, and occasionally a how-to video on a specific pose at the top of search. Meanwhile, the Bing app has new updates aimed at making the food search experience “even richer”, including information on calorie counts and low-fat recipes. Image: Bing blogs Bing’s new updates are obviously aimed at providing more intuitive, quick answers to users’ search queries in the same way that Google already does with Quick Answers and featured snippets. While they might be on a smaller scale, the tie-in with different times of year such as Black Friday and New Year is a fun way to introduce these features and draw users’ attention to them through the things they are most likely to be searching for.

Which Google algorithm changes impacted marketers most in 2016 - and what can we expect from 2017? 10 online marketing strategies to make you a unicorn [infographic] How the fake information epidemic will hurt local search in 2017 Headlines about the online fake news epidemic have been everywhere since the US Election, particularly if you follow news about publishing or social media. But Wesley Young, Vice President of Public Affairs for the Local Search Association, believes that this problem is set to get worse in 2017 – and that it will be damaging to local search in particular. In a column for Search Engine Land, Young laid out how the issue of fake news and information can hurt marketers, along with eight ways that false information is currently being used which marketers should be aware of. “As consumers search for information to help make purchase decisions, uncertainty about the veracity of the information they receive impacts the effectiveness of local search marketing. Online advertising already faces challenges gaining consumer trust, and the proliferation of fake content will only hurt it more. Worse, you may be spending money on advertising that no one ever sees, be competing in an unfair market, suffer from hits to your reputation or pay more than you should for marketing products or services. Being aware of how false information is being used will help marketers avoid problems and identify when they may be affected, saving them from both headaches and wasted dollars.” Google clarifies details of its mobile interstitials penalty As part of Google’s ongoing efforts to improve the experience of browsing the mobile web, a penalty for sites which use annoying mobile interstitials – pop-ups which appear while a website is loading and cover the entire page – is due to take effect next week, beginning on 10th January. The question of what kind of interstitials, exactly, will incur penalties has been the subject of considerable discussion amongst the SEO community. This week, Google provided some further clarification on the issue in the form of a tweet from Webmaster Trends Analyst John Wu. He was responding to a query from Kristine Schachinger, technical SEO expert and founder of digital marketing agency The Vetters, about whether the penalty will only affect interstitials which appear when users are navigating from the search results page to a mobile site, or whether it will include interstitials which appear when navigating between pages of the same website. @schachin @methode yes — John ☆.o(≧▽≦)o.☆ (@JohnMu) January 4, 2017 Schachinger further enquired as to whether the penalty would affect interstitials which appear between an AMP page and a regular site page, to which Mu replied, “I haven’t seen an interstitial there, but that would be seen the same as site-page -> site-page.” Want to stay on top of the latest search trends?Get top insights and news from our search experts.

It’s a fair question in light of attempts by authorities investigating the slaying of an Arkansas man to obtain voice recordings collected by an Amazon Echo speaker and its Alexa digital assistant. Yet the popularity and capabilities of voice-enabled products such as the Echo continue to grow. At the CES gadget show in Las Vegas, which opened Thursday, Whirlpool, Samsung and other manufacturers are unveiling new ways to use voice services to control laundry machines, refrigerators and other home systems. Consumers are apparently willing to trade a certain amount of privacy for convenience. So what exactly is being collected, stored or shared ? To work, the Echo is always listening. Once it hears someone utter a keyword, such as “Alexa,” it shares what it hears with Amazon’s servers to process a response. Those conversations are then stored indefinitely. Google’s Home speaker works in a similar fashion. The Echo “has to listen to everything. That’s kind of disturbing,” said Ryan O’Leary, vice-president of WhiteHat Security’s threat research centre. “It doesn’t capture voice until it hears the keyword, but it could. You’re trusting the devices to not do that, but it’s entirely possible.” In the Arkansas case, authorities investigating the death of a man found floating face-up in a hot tub at a friend’s home requested the contents of the home’s Echo and Amazon’s stored recordings in hopes they might contain evidence. The friend is charged with murder. A judge has signed off on the search, but Amazon has balked. Amazon has declined to comment specifically on the case but said the company objects to “overbroad or otherwise inappropriate demands as a matter of course.” Some experts worry that allowing such a search would erode people’s privacy. “It’s not necessarily a direct threat for the average person, but the same thing can be said with any kind of privacy concern,” O’Leary said. “People say you shouldn’t be concerned if you’re not doing anything wrong, but that’s a dangerous precedent to set.” Meanwhile, companies keep asking consumers to invite them into their homes. Whirlpool is adding Alexa voice control to its smart-home appliances, including a washing machine, a stove and a refrigerator. Someone can instruct the oven to pre-heat to 400 degrees by speaking a command to an Alexa-enabled device, such as the Echo. Simplehuman has a voice-activated trash can, and GE Lighting has a table lamp using Alexa voice control. For now, voice control is mainly an add-on feature rather than a core component of gadgets. It’s there for those who want to use it, but it’s not essential for the product to function. Many manufacturers are opting to use Amazon’s Alexa service for now, though some are embracing voice systems from Google, Apple or Samsung. Nvidia’s Shield TV streaming device, for instance, employs Google’s Assistant service so viewers can control video playback or find out the weather with just a voice command. Meanwhile, Samsung’s new Family Hub lets people use their voice to add items to shopping lists and order groceries online. CES chief economist Shawn DuBravac said as many as 700 companies could announce Alexa-integrated products during the gadget show, on top of more than 1,500 existing ones. As the smart home becomes more entrenched, DuBravac said, voice control could change the way we interact with technology in much the way the mouse did in the 1980s. “Connected microphones are starting to appear in everything from cars to children’s toys,” said James Plouffe, lead solutions architect at mobile-security company MobileIron. “Consumers should think carefully about how comfortable they are with the prospect of a live mic in common household items.” Because Amazon says it uses information gathered by the Echo to improve its voice technology, that information has the potential to “live forever” online, Plouffe said. The issue first grabbed headlines a couple of years ago, after Samsung said sensitive conversations could be captured by its voice-controlled smart TVs. Based on the flood of new voice-controlled gadgets headed to market, tech companies are betting that consumers will get over their fears. Derrick Dicol, executive director of Comcast’s Xfinity home, which uses voice controls in its home automation products, noted that people had to get used to sharing their banking information online. “This is less invasive than that,” he said. “It’s just a different thing people have to feel comfortable with.”     Videos Call of Duty's John Marshall Jones On The Wonders Of Motion Capture Raw: Deadly Train Crash in Egypt A Houston Mom Found Security Footage Of Her Daughters' Bedroom Online Deep-Space Exploration Requires Habitats, And NASA's On It Prepared For Takeoff: Amazon Launches Its First Branded Cargo Plane Samsung Galaxy Note 7 comes with iris scanner Anton Yelchin's Parents -- Sues Chrysler ...

Daniel B. Kline (TMFDankline) Jan 6, 2017 at 9:14AM For the past few years, home automation -- the so-called smart home -- has been coming, but in 2017 it might be time to say it's here. Products like Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Echo/Alexa and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Home, along with Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone/Siri, have become viable platforms to control smart homes. And while only Amazon and Google have an official presence at the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show (CES), smart-home devices that work with one or more of those platforms (as well as others) were one of the dominant trends at the show. In fact, the Consumer Technology Association (CTA), which puts on the show, released a new report on the eve of CES saying that smart homes would be the "most popular means of Internet of Things engagement." CTA also predicted sales of 29 million units in 2017, a 63% percent increase over 2016. To make that happen, companies need to deliver devices that meet consumer needs. A new survey from Coldwell Banker Real Estate and Vivint Smart Homes found that there is one feature that a majority of Americans want on their smart-home devices: voice control. Smart home devices were everywhere at CES 2017. Image source: author. What does the survey say? The report showed that more than 7 in 10 (72%) Americans who already have smart-home products controlled remotely by a smartphone, tablet, computer, or separate automatic system within the home itself want voice control. But, only 48% of people who have smart-home devices, the report found, already have voice control capability. "We're not surprised that so many Americans want to be able to use their voice to control smart home products because it makes for a much more intuitive user experience," said Coldwell Banker Chief Marketing Officer Sean Blankenship. " ... we're hearing directly from our agents that their clients are demanding voice control to make their smart home experience more seamless." Parents want voice control, according to the research, and nearly 4 in 5 (79%) of Generation X members have smart-home products but want voice control. That's followed by millennials at 74%, and baby boomers at 63%. "Last year we announced our integration with Amazon Echo and we've been blown away with how consumers are unlocking the full potential of a voice-controlled smart home," said Vivint CMO Jeff Lyman. "By simply saying aloud what they want to happen with their locks, lights, thermostats and security system, customers spend more time living and less time managing. The experience is pretty magical." What are Americans using voice control for? When it comes to people who have smart homes with voice control and people who want smart homes with voice control, the top use in both cases is entertainment. That was the top use for the former at 57% and the latter at 43%. In both cases, controlling smart lighting was the second choice. Image source: Coldwell Banker/Vivint. Why is voice control important? Most Americans believe that voice control will give them a more intuitive user experience, according to the Coldwell Banker/Vivint report, which was produced by surveying 4,108 U.S. adults ages 18 and older, among whom 923 have any smart home products. "The most commonly cited benefits for using voice control among respondents were hands-free control at 30%, increased user-friendliness at 17% and flexibility in location at 14%," read the study. Part of the reason Americans want voice control in their smart-home devices is because they are already comfortable with the technology. Of the people surveyed who already have smart-home products, 74% of them said they use voice control on their smartphones. This is what's coming While Siri has stumbled at least partly because Apple launched it without tightly limiting its parameters and Google's Assistant has yet to make much of a mark, Amazon Echo shows that people will use voice control at home. Going from asking a digital assistant to tell you the weather or playing a song to having one actually control your home will take some time. Amazon has taken a smart approach by slowly adding functionality and opening up its Echo/Alexa platform to outside developers. That has given the company a foothold in people's houses that might allow it to expand its presence. Apple, Google, and maybe even a few others have a chance to work their way in as well (and a quick look around at CES shows that dozens, maybe hundreds are trying to get involved in some fashion), but it's very clear that whatever products people select, voice control will have to be a key component.

Last week, Facebook unveiled a tool called “style transfer” that applies visual effects to live phone video in real time. Making your clips look like an episode of The Simpsons or a Van Gogh painting may seem gimmicky, but the artificial intelligence required to do this would usually need to run on massive servers. Google squeezed a neural network into its Google Translate app last year. Now, Facebook has developed a deep learning system called Caffe2Go that is condensed enough to run directly in mobile apps on iOS and Android. The style transfer technique will be the first opportunity for users to try it out. Event: Instant Expert: Artificial Intelligence New Scientist spoke to Facebook’s chief technology officer, Mike Schroepfer, about the company’s work in AI and how it will affect the way we communicate, from the existing Facebook newsfeed to the future of virtual reality and increasing global connectivity. Advertisement How do you make a neural network that’s efficient enough to run on a mobile device? If you think of this neural net as a sequence of steps, where you’re processing information at each step and feeding it to the next one, then one of the goals from the algorithmic standpoint is to reduce that to the smallest number of steps yet get the same results. So, basically, the algorithmic challenge is building smaller models that produce very similar results. And then the second part is lots of optimisation specific to working on mobile devices. Even if you have one of these small neural net models, if you take it and naively implement it on a mobile phone, it just won’t work. So we had a really interesting pairing of the scientists, who were trying to figure out how to do model compression, combined with people who are really good at chip-level optimisation, who were trying lots of different techniques to optimise each of the parts to make it run very quickly on the phone. Changing videos to make them more artistic is fun, but what else could we use it for? One of the reasons we focused on this, although it seems like just a fun, slightly silly application, is that when you’re creating something, the delay could turn something that would otherwise be fun into something arduous. That time delay is the difference between fun, creative spontaneity and not doing it, basically. But there are other things. We have demos running where you can combine this application with object detection, so if you want to apply different effects to the foreground and background of the video, you could do that. What else is Facebook training neural net technology to do? It’s doing all sorts of different things. We’re using it for translations. We’re using it to automatically generate captions for the billions of images uploaded every day, so if you have a visual disability and want to have a photo effectively read to you, you can have that happen. We’re using it to help improve newsfeed ranking: of the thousands of possible stories you can see, you’re going to read only 10 or 20 or 30, and we’re going to show you the best possible ones. We use it for spam detection, so if people are trying to share things on Facebook that don’t belong, we can detect it and eliminate it. You’ve previously talked about the role of virtual reality in future social interactions. How is Facebook’s AI going to help? AI is a key technology to make VR work. Figuring out where your head and hands are in the real world and mapping them into the VR world is a computer vision and VR problem. Without that, the system just doesn’t work. You couldn’t easily have done this 10 or 20 years ago the way you can today. Think about the further problem of how we bring realistic avatars into the VR world. If someone’s laughing while I’m in VR with them, we can detect that and make sure the avatar looks like it’s laughing. And as the person is speaking, we’re actually analysing the phonemes and animating the mouth of their avatar so it looks realistic, like the individual is speaking rather than just having the avatar sitting there not moving its mouth. You’re not going to feel a sense of presence with that person if their avatar is just stony-faced all the time. In the long run, think about all these systems out there that are building intelligent agents, whether they are messenger bots or things you can speak to in the home. VR will be a natural environment for that too because you could have something that could help you navigate the mass of the virtual world. You could say, “Hey, take me to Mars,” or “Take me to see my friend Joe,” and the virtual agent could help you navigate rather than clicking menus or moving buttons around. It would be a natural place for a virtual assistant, but that’s probably in the more distant future. What would it take to develop that? I think speech recognition is a generally well-solved problem in artificial intelligence and is working really well, but a harder challenge in AI that people are also making progress on is natural language understanding: disambiguating what people are saying. When I say, “Take me to Mars,” what does that mean? Is this a specific game? Is it a trailer for The Martian? What am I referring to? That is a challenging problem in AI. When these systems work and they give you exactly what you want, it’s awesome and magical. But when they give you the wrong answer, it’s really frustrating. So you want to build systems that work more often than not, otherwise people won’t use them. That’s one of the problems with AI: building systems that understand language in the way humans do. What’s your vision for when we’ve all got neural nets in our pockets? The one resource that people can’t get back is time. The days pass and the time goes, and you can’t get it back. I think where AI can really help us is by focusing our time on the things we care about. I could spend the time learning three more languages so I can communicate with family members, or if I have a system that can automatically translate, I can spend that time with those family members instead, or I can spend that time creating music or pursuing hobbies or doing work, whatever it may be. That’s my hope: that people waste no time on things that are unimportant because we have systems watching out for us and making sure we’re focused on the things we most care about.

Daniel B. Kline (TMFDankline) Jan 6, 2017 at 9:14AM For the past few years, home automation -- the so-called smart home -- has been coming, but in 2017 it might be time to say it's here. Products like Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Echo/Alexa and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Home, along with Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone/Siri, have become viable platforms to control smart homes. And while only Amazon and Google have an official presence at the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show (CES), smart-home devices that work with one or more of those platforms (as well as others) were one of the dominant trends at the show. In fact, the Consumer Technology Association (CTA), which puts on the show, released a new report on the eve of CES saying that smart homes would be the "most popular means of Internet of Things engagement." CTA also predicted sales of 29 million units in 2017, a 63% percent increase over 2016. To make that happen, companies need to deliver devices that meet consumer needs. A new survey from Coldwell Banker Real Estate and Vivint Smart Homes found that there is one feature that a majority of Americans want on their smart-home devices: voice control. Smart home devices were everywhere at CES 2017. Image source: author. What does the survey say? The report showed that more than 7 in 10 (72%) Americans who already have smart-home products controlled remotely by a smartphone, tablet, computer, or separate automatic system within the home itself want voice control. But, only 48% of people who have smart-home devices, the report found, already have voice control capability. "We're not surprised that so many Americans want to be able to use their voice to control smart home products because it makes for a much more intuitive user experience," said Coldwell Banker Chief Marketing Officer Sean Blankenship. " ... we're hearing directly from our agents that their clients are demanding voice control to make their smart home experience more seamless." Parents want voice control, according to the research, and nearly 4 in 5 (79%) of Generation X members have smart-home products but want voice control. That's followed by millennials at 74%, and baby boomers at 63%. "Last year we announced our integration with Amazon Echo and we've been blown away with how consumers are unlocking the full potential of a voice-controlled smart home," said Vivint CMO Jeff Lyman. "By simply saying aloud what they want to happen with their locks, lights, thermostats and security system, customers spend more time living and less time managing. The experience is pretty magical." What are Americans using voice control for? When it comes to people who have smart homes with voice control and people who want smart homes with voice control, the top use in both cases is entertainment. That was the top use for the former at 57% and the latter at 43%. In both cases, controlling smart lighting was the second choice. Image source: Coldwell Banker/Vivint. Why is voice control important? Most Americans believe that voice control will give them a more intuitive user experience, according to the Coldwell Banker/Vivint report, which was produced by surveying 4,108 U.S. adults ages 18 and older, among whom 923 have any smart home products. "The most commonly cited benefits for using voice control among respondents were hands-free control at 30%, increased user-friendliness at 17% and flexibility in location at 14%," read the study. Part of the reason Americans want voice control in their smart-home devices is because they are already comfortable with the technology. Of the people surveyed who already have smart-home products, 74% of them said they use voice control on their smartphones. This is what's coming While Siri has stumbled at least partly because Apple launched it without tightly limiting its parameters and Google's Assistant has yet to make much of a mark, Amazon Echo shows that people will use voice control at home. Going from asking a digital assistant to tell you the weather or playing a song to having one actually control your home will take some time. Amazon has taken a smart approach by slowly adding functionality and opening up its Echo/Alexa platform to outside developers. That has given the company a foothold in people's houses that might allow it to expand its presence. Apple, Google, and maybe even a few others have a chance to work their way in as well (and a quick look around at CES shows that dozens, maybe hundreds are trying to get involved in some fashion), but it's very clear that whatever products people select, voice control will have to be a key component.

The new Nvidia Shield TV delivers better streaming quality, support for Google Assistant as well as better overall performance. The new Nvidia Shield TV now comes with 4K HDR video support. That feature will only be taken advantage of by people who have 4K HDR TVs as well as those subscribed to services that offer that type of streaming quality. Amazon Prime Video and Netflix already have some 4K HDR content, but users will also be able to stream regular 4K content from the likes of YouTube, Vudu and Google Play, as pointed out by Android Authority. Nvidia Shield TVMore The new Nvidia Shield TV is bundled with the remote and the redesigned gamepad. Photo: Nvidia Nvidia claims that the new Shield TV offers three times the performance of any other streaming device that’s available in the market. A short hands-on demo of "Titanfall 2" streaming at 4K at 60Hz ran smoothly with no lag, according to PC Gamer.The new streamer also comes with the newly redesigned gamepad and the same remote. Even with added power, Nvidia also managed to make its streaming device’s chassis 40 percent smaller than its predecessor. Nvidia didn’t specify what it actually changed on the new Shield TV, but it appears as though the most of the improvements were made possible through software optimization. The new model is still powered by an octa-core Tegra X1 ARM chip (quad-core Cortex-A57 & quad-core Cortex-A53) paired with 3GB of RAM. Speaking of software, the device still runs Android, but this time around it supports Google Assistant, the same voice-activated digital assistant that’s on the Pixel and Pixel XL. The new Shield TV will be the first to support the software, but other Android-powered streamers and TVs running version 6.0 (Marshmallow) and up will be getting the feature as well. Users will be able to simply say “Ok Google” to bring up the digital assistant and give out a command. Users will be able to ask Google Assistant to play specific content on services like Netflix or even YouTube. Like on the Pixel phones, the Google Assistant on the Nvidia Shield TV will be able to respond to contextual commands, according to TechCrunch. Lastly, there are two versions of the Nvidia Shield TV, the $200 16GB model and the $300 Pro model that comes with 500GB of storage. Both models are available to pre-order now and are slated to start shipping later this month.

Here's everything important that's launched at CES 2017. Amazon at CES 2017 Pocket-lint Believe it or not, although Amazon isn't really at CES in any form, it's managed to walk into just about every product. That's because Amazon's Alexa is behind a lot of the interesting technology that's launching at CES. There's Alexa-power fridges, Alexa-powered cars, Alexa-powered lights. There's Alexa in so many forms, it's a complete smart home white wash from Amazon. The machines are coming: CES 2017 is all about Amazon Alexa Asus at CES 2017 Asus Asus has used CES 2017 to give us another choice when it comes to choosing a Google Tango smartphone. The new ZenFone AR is a smartphone built for 3D scanning, working with Tango, helping you capture the world around you in more dimensions. It also happens to be powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 chipset and support Google's Daydream VR platform too. Google Tango gets another phone in the Asus ZenFone AR Asus has also released one of the most interesting Chromebooks we've seen so far, the Asus Chromebook Flip, or C302, to use its official name. This is a flexible device, with the display folding right back on itself for tablet mode, with a 12.5-inch display. The Flip is also one of the more powerful Chromebooks to be released so far, meaning it should make for a great portable Google machine. Asus Chromebook Flip is now a 12.5-inch awesome machine BlackBerry at CES 2017 Pocket-lint BlackBerry lives on! Well, the hardware moved over to TCL who will me using the BlackBerry name under license. TCL was also on hand to show off this, the widely-rumoured Mercury. This keyboard touting smartphone was shown off in prototype form, offering a touch and type arrangement, giving you the full Android BlackBerry experience that made it's debut on the Priv. Since then we've seen the DTEK range launch, and there's rumours that this device will be called the DTEK70 when it launches. Blackberry Mercury preview: Fingerprint scanner and QWERTY keyboard for BB's next flagship Casio at CES 2017 Pocket-lint Casio has launched an updated version of its rugged outdoor watch, the WSD-F20. This newer version of the Android Wear 2.0 watch offers a dual-layer display, able to slip into a lower power monochrome mode for simple tasks like checking the time. With a tweak to enhance the rugged looks, the new model also supercharges GPS, enabling offline mapping and navigation for when you're truely disconnected. The new Casio WSD-F20 will be available from 21 April 2017, price to be confirmed. Casio WSD-F20 preview: Rugged outdoor smartwatch shows Android Wear can be great Dell at CES 2017 Dell Dell has used CES 2017 to announce an exciting development of the XPS - a 2-in-1 hybrid version. The Dell XPS has long been seen as one of the hottest notebooks around, but now there's an XPS 13 2-in-1 to take on the likes of the Microsoft Surface Book. There's also choices of Full HD or Quad HD displays, plenty of connectivity and fingerprint scanners for security. Dell unveils XPS 13 2-in-1 laptop at CES 2017 Faraday Future at CES 2017 Faraday Future Faraday Future is a relatively new company, only being founded in 2014. It focuses on the development of intelligent electric vehicles and has already delivered a concept car in the form of the FF Zero 1 and is even involved with Formula E. The company used CES 2017 to unveil the FF91, it's car of the future. The FF91 is a luxury electric car, claiming a Tesla-beating 0-60 time of 2.39 seconds, and offering a full run of autonomous features, like self driving and self parking. It houses a 130kWh battery offering 378 miles range, offers window dimming with a tap of the finger for privacy and more technology than you can shake a stick at. Reservations are open for $5000, right now, but there's no word on the final cost. Faraday Future's first production car, FF91 hits the road in 2018 Garmin at CES 2017 Garmin Garmin has announced a new Fenix sports watch, bringing variety to one of the most potent fitness devices available. The Garmin Fenix 5 comes in a chunky 47mm size, but is also available in 42mm if you opt for the Fenix 5S, meaning that this adventurer's watch is suitable for a wider range of wrist sizes. Then there's the 5X which gets larger and throws in mapping too. Fully-featured, the Fenix 5 promises 24 hours of GPS tracking, with full support for runners, riders and adventurous types. Garmin Fenix 5 brings fitness finesse in smaller sizes  Honor at CES 2017 Pocket-lint Honor has announced the Honor 6X, a budget smartphone that offers a surprising number of top-spec features, like a dual camera on the rear. Priced at about £225, the new Honor 6X is a 5.5-inch full HD smartphone, with the pairing of a 12-megapixel and 2-megapixel camera on the rear, the second lens offering things like bokeh effects. The Honor 6X is surprisingly well-built and although offers mid-range power, it looks like one of the hottest mid-range devices around. Honor 6X preview: 'Mate 9 Mini' delivers dual cameras for just £225 HP at CES 2017 HP HP has announced an update to its Spectre x360 notebooks, giving you the latest hardware in a lovely premium and flexible design. Cast in aluminium, the hinge will let you set the display at just about any angle you want, including folding it all the way flat. That display is available in 4K, which is almost edge to edge in its coverage. An impressive looking machine, the Spectre x360 is likely to be one of the hottest Windows devices to come out of CES. Gorgeous 4K HP Spectre x360 range updated with micro-edge screens Huawei at CES 2017 Pocket-lint When Huawei announced the Mate 9, it also unveiled a smaller, prettier Porsche Design model. The latter which costs €1,395. Here's the company's fix: the Mate 9 Pro, which is 99 per cent the Porsche Design version in white or silver skin. It won't cost half as much either. Well, if it ever makes it out of China - which is the only country it's confirmed for release at present.  We think the Pro is a great-looking phone. It's very close in look to the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge. And given how well that phone has gone down this year, Huawei would be mad to not get the Pro ranged the world over. We're rather excited by this 5.5-inch phone. Huawei Mate 9 Pro preview: The Mate we wanted all along Lenovo at CES 2017 Pocket-lint Lenovo has announce a wide range of updates to its notebooks, but the Miix 720 looks to be an exciting prospect and a real alternative to the Surface Pro 4. Weighing just over a 1kg and with a 12-inch display, there's the latest Intel Core processors, up to 16GB RAM and 1TB storage. There's whole range of connectivity, from USB and Thunderbolt 3 through to SD card slot, as well as a battery that claims to last for 8 hours. Lenovo Miix 720 preview: The ultra-powerful portable 2-in-1 Lenovo has also unveiled its own version of Amazon's Echo, in the form of the Smart Assistant. The name might be a little boring, but using Alexa's platform, this smart speaker will perform the sorts of tasks that the Echo will. Best of all, there's a range of different colours, as well as a Harman Kardon version that promises to improve the sound quality. Lenovo Smart Assistant preview: Transformers, Alexa in disguise LG at CES 2017 LG LG announced a range of products before CES started, making way for the big announcements at the show. And big they were. Leading the pack is the LG Signature OLED TV W, a TV that is as minimal as TV gets. Only 2.5mm thick, this is essentially OLED wallpaper that sticks to your wall using magnets. Oh, and it comes with a Dolby Atmos soundbar, for good measure. LG Signature OLED W TV attaches to your wall using magnets and is just 2.5mm thick Aside from the signature television, LG has updated its "regular" OLED TVs, launching the G7, E7, C7 and B7, follow similar demarcations as its 2016 line. Only now these OLED TVs are 25 per cent brighter and they all support the full range of HDR formats - HDR 10, Dolby Vision, HLG and Advanced HDR by Technicolor. LG's 2017 OLED TVs are brighter than ever before and support Dolby Atmos Following the Dolby theme, LG kept going, launching an Ultra HD blu-ray player that supports Dolby Vision, the first to do so. But more interestingly LG also embraced Alexa, announcing the LG Hub Robot, a cuter take on Amazon's Echo, and also stuffed Alexa into a fridge. Yes, that's right, a fridge with webOS. LG has an Alexa-powered fridge, move over Samsung Family Hub Netatmo at CES 2017 Velux Netatmo has used CES 2017 to announce plans to future connect your smart home. The first big announcement was a partnership with Velux, the window manufacturer. Adapting the Velux Integra windows with increased connectivity, you'll be able to control your windows with your smartphones as well as have integration with Netatmo's sensors. Bad air quality in the apartment? Your Velux Active roof windows can automatically open for fresh air. Velux Active windows achieve peak smart home with Netatmo sensor integration, smartphone control In addition to hooking up with Velux, Netatmo has also launched a Smart Smoke Alarm. As the name suggests, this is a connected smoke detector that can send alerts to your phone when smoke is detected. Taking it a step further, with HomeKit and IFTTT compatibility you can ensure that your lights are turned on when the alarm goes off, or you get pictures from your home camera. Netatmo takes on Nest Protect with its own Smart Smoke Alarm New Balance at CES 2017 New Balance That's right, that company you associate with sports shoes and apparel as stepped out and launched a couple of connected running devices. The New Balance RunIQ is an Android Wear smartwatch aimed at runners, offering GPS and heart-rate monitoring, as well as water protection. It's joined by the PaceIQ headphones, built by Jabra, which connect to the watch and feature a button to press to get real-time updates on your run session. New Balance RunIQ Android Wear smartwatch and PaceIQ headphones are all about runners Nvidia at CES 2017 Nvidia Nvidia has announced a new Shield TV set-top box that's fully-loaded with entertainment potential, offering Android gaming, Android TV, as well as positioning itself as a Google Assistant-power smart hub. The main points of interest will likely be the 4K and HDR support, meaning you'll going to get some awesome quality streaming from services like Netflix. New Nvidia Shield TV is the 4K Android entertainment centre and smart home hub of the future Expanding on the Shield TV and really making the new set-top box a smart home hub is the Shield Spot. This innovative little device plugs into the wall and connects to the console via Wi-Fi, meaning you can access Google Assistant all around your house. "Ok Google, turn on the lights", and the Shield Spot will send that to the TV box to make it happen. Nvidia Shield Spot extends the 4K console's reach through your home Panasonic at CES 2017 Panasonic The Panasonic EZ1002 sees the company launching an OLED TV, something that was the preserve of LG over the past few years. Panasonic is claiming that this will be a 4K HDR master, thanks to the boosted brightness that the company has achieved, important for those dramatic contrast effects that HDR is known for. Panasonic EZ1002 4K OLED TV doubles-down on peak brightness for HDR thrills Panasonic is also continuing its push to get Ultra HD Blu-ray in as many homes as possible, lining up three new players, the UB400, UB310 and UB300. These players will differ slightly in spec, meaning that there's a range of options and hopefully prices points - which are yet to be revealed. Panasonic has a trio of 4K UHD Blu-ray players for 2017 Of course Panasonic isn't only about displaying 4K, it's also about capture and with the new Lumix GH5, 4K video capture is taken very seriously. This flagship compact system camera offers some high-end features for videographers, but also promises to be the highest quality Lumix that Panasonic has released so far, with a new 20-megapixel sensor, new in-body stabilisation, and lots of options. Priced at £1699 (body only), the GH5 will be available in March. Panasonic Lumix GH5 preview: A new benchmark for 4K capture If you're looking for something a little more compact, then the Lumix GX800 might be the camera for you. This is the smallest and cheapest of the Lumix G family at £499 with lens, but still packs a punch with 4K capture and plenty of controls. With some nice retro colour options (like Tan and Orange), this is a system camera you can just about squeeze into your pocket. Panasonic Lumix GX800 preview: Small but perfectly formed Qualcomm at CES 2017 Qualcomm Qualcomm has used CES 2017 to double-down on the message that the Snapdragon 835 will be driving the the flagship smartphones of 2017. The new chipset shrinks in size, but increases the power and the connectivity options, supporting the latest protocols like Bluetooth 5 and ad Wi-Fi. We're yet to hear what devices the SD835 will appear in, but all eyes now turn to Mobile World Congress 2017. 2017 flagship smartphones can be thinner but more powerful, says Qualcomm Samsung at CES 2017 Pocket-lint Samsung announced refreshed Galaxy A series smartphones and a new Powerbot VR7000 remote vacuum cleaner, but that was just a warm up. Then the was the Family Hub 2, an updated connected fridge. Thing got really cool, however, with the announcement of the new line-up of QLED TVs. Announcing an updated approach to last year's SUHD TVs, it's now all about QLED for Samsung, promising double the brightness, peaking at 2000 nits and promising rich colours from that Quantum Dot layer. Samsung QLED TV preview: Is this Samsung's best ever television range? Sony at CES 2017 Pocket-lint With little clue as to Sony's plans, the company pulled a blinder, revealing an OLED TV - the Bravia A1 - which combines not only stunning picture quality, but uses the entire screen as a speaker.

There's Dolby Vision support too on this 4K TV that leaves us in no doubt at all that Sony still knows how to innovate. Sony Bravia A1 Series OLED TV preview: Breathtaking pictures and unique audio tech combine Not neglecting LED TVs, Sony has also announced a full line-up of refreshed XE series televisions, from the XE94 at the top in 77-inch size, then dropping down to the XE93 in a wide variety of sizes. These top sets also support Dolby Vision and use Sony's Slim Backlight Drive+ system, aiming to give better dimming to ensure contrast and accuracy without bleed. Down through the XE90, XE85 and XE80, each step losing a feature or two, there's a 4K HDR TV for just about anyone. Sony announces refreshed line-up of 4K HDR TVs, including Dolby Vision support Sony is doubling up on Dolby Vision support, launching a Ultra HD Blu-ray player that also supports the advanced HDR format. With at least six mainstream Ultra HD Blu-ray players launching at CES 2017, it looks like the format is really taking hold.

But they’re still welcome of course. Google Docs, Google Sheets, and Google Slides have all received some new features in their latest versions, including the ability to edit the page setup options, as well as support for ODF and epub file exporting, and other small details, all of which aim to make it easier for you to do things while on the move. It’s sometimes frustrating that the things you can do on the desktop version, sometimes you still can’t do on the mobile app. But Google is slowly but surely changing that. This time around, you can now change some things in the page setup of the Docs app, particularly the page orientation, paper size, and page color. As for the Sheets app, you can now use the IMAGE function so you can view the images that were inserted inside of the cells. If you would like to export your documents into an EPUB (.epub) or OpenDocument Text (.odt) file and also import the OpenDocument Text files form Android. You can also now import and export the OpenDocument Spreadsheets (.ods) and OpenDocument Presentations (.odp). All of these new features are available when your device is online. An error saying “Data connection needed to open this file type” will appear if you don’t have any connection. The updates to the G Suite apps are rolling out already but it might take 1-3 days for full visibility to take effect. You can check if it’s already available by going to their respective Google Play pages.

(Gareth van Zyl) RELATED ARTICLES Asian phone makers flock to Google’s VR ‘Daydream’ Android apps to run on Samsung's new laptops Honda in talks with Google on self-drive tech Johannesburg - Google will now help users keep their New Year’s fitness resolutions through an update on the Calendar app.  The update will help users find time during schedules for exercise activities and to reach their goals. “If you’re setting out to achieve a goal, seeing progress can be a great motivation. Goals in Google Calendar makes finding time for activities like hitting the gym or going on more runs easy,” the company said in a post on their official blog.  Users will be able to connect Google Fit and Apple Health to your fitness goals in the Google Calendar such as “run 3 times a week” with the app helping the user find time and stick to it.  READ: Fitbit brings two new fitness trackers to SA When a user does an activity in a fitness app, the app will record the activity and used it to mark goals in Google Calendar as “done” automatically. A new visual performance tracker is also included in the app.  “With this integration, future goal times will be even more tailored based on when you’re most likely to complete them,” Google said. “Say you set a goal to run at 6:30 every other morning but aren’t actually hitting your stride until 7:15 — Google Calendar has you covered and will adjust accordingly,” they went further to say.  This means that the app will also  help users find the best time to do an activity.

Simon Erickson and Dylan Lewis (TMFInnovator) Jan 6, 2017 at 7:48AM On our last 2016 episode of Industry Focus: Tech, Motley Fool analysts Dylan Lewis and Simon Erickson preview what investors can expect in the tech space in 2017. Find out why they think wearable technology will enjoy some new growth avenues, what will probably happen with smart home devices, why M&A might die down from its peak in 2015. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Dec. 23, 2016. Dylan Lewis: Welcome to Industry Focus, the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. It's Friday, December 23rd, and we're looking forward to what 2017 has in store for tech. I'm your host, Dylan Lewis, and I'm joined in studio by Motley Fool premium analyst Simon Erickson. Simon, how's it going? Simon Erickson: Great, Dylan. Thanks very much for having me. Lewis: What are your holiday plans? Erickson: Heading back down to my home state of Texas, where it will be much warmer than up here in Alexandria. Lewis: I'm doing the opposite. I'm going further north where it will be colder, in New Jersey. Erickson: I wish you the best of luck. Lewis: It's going to be a little rough. This is our last show for 2016. Next week, we're actually going to be reairing some of our favorite episodes from the past year, to fill the gap between Christmas and the New Year's holiday. Simon, I was tempted to do the show where we surprised John Rotonti with your posed listener question, ultimately wound up going with something I shot with David Kretzmann about stock-based compensation. It seemed a little bit more relevant. But that was a good time. We should do that again. Erickson: I'm pretty sure my accent completely gave me away. It was really a terrible accent I tried for John, and I think he was on to me. Lewis: Because he couldn't see you, he could only hear this wild, hackneyed accent asking him a question about why it's wrong, about value investing, I think? Erickson: I think so. Lewis: But, yeah, since this is our last new show of the year, I thought maybe we would look forward to 2017, give listeners an idea of some of the things that we're watching in tech for this upcoming year. I know one thing that you're really hot on is wearable technology, and it possibly morphing beyond the traditional consumer electronics market, right? Erickson: I think that my first prediction is that wearable devices are going to look much more like medical devices in the coming year or two. We've gotten accustomed to Fitbits tracking our steps, maybe telling us a little bit about how we sleep, and a lot of fitness tracking that is kind of interesting and useful. But they're expanding how these can be used beyond just fitness. I think we're going to start seeing that more, because the real money for this is going to be coming from insurers. Insurers are going to want to see more functionality than just how many steps you're taking or what they're doing today.  And we're starting to see some of that already. We've seen now Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) work with Medtronic for type 2 diabetes to monitor blood sugar and things like this. I think that's going to be my first prediction -- you're going to start seeing a lot more of that where it's more specific applications, but it's going to be tied to insurance reimbursements. Lewis: Because really, for the insurers, more data is better. They want as much as they can to help build out some of the actuarial tables and some of the pricing for a lot of the plans they're going to be offering. In terms of better understanding patient outcomes and best treatments, there's a lot of applications there as well. Erickson: We just went to the ConnectedHealth conference here in D.C. just a couple of weeks ago and found out that about 40% of your health is based on behavior, which is very interesting, what are you eating, how active are you, what are you doing out there? And I think that plays into the wearable technology trend. You just have to get to where the money is in this industry. I think that really is from the insurers. Lewis: I think very often, people can be blind to things that are automated and rote for them because they're just humming in the background. It's a decision that they don't even realize they're making. You have some of these wearables that can help identify that in a big data step back type of way, and that can be very compelling for the insurance and healthcare market. Erickson: Absolutely. Lewis: Another area I know you're watching is how some big tech titans will be focusing on the cloud, and it sounds like the smart home market as well. Erickson: We have Alexa in our home right now -- Lewis: And actually, our podcasts have an integration with Alexa. Erickson: You can actually ask them to play our podcasts, right? Lewis: Yeah, if you feel like doing that some time. Erickson: Getting smarter, right? The Amazon Echo, which is what we refer to as Alexa here, is already a hardware device that was launched in 2015, collecting data for Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to facilitate more e-commerce transactions. Now, this last year, we saw Google Home introduce their own hardware competing product, so they can get more information on what you're searching for and what you're wanting to do, which, of course, can drive advertising. We've seen that Jeff Bezos has said he has 1,000 employees working on Amazon Echo right now. Lewis: That's insane. Erickson: It's really crazy to think about. They've sold 5 million of these already earlier this year. So, this is a really big project for a really big company, and an innovative visionary leader that's not afraid to put money behind some of his best ideas. I really think that not only Amazon but also Google, also Microsoft, also Facebook, are wanting to collect more and more data that you're giving it in your living room, so that they can supplement and improve their businesses. Lewis: And it seems like a lot of these hardware solutions are really reducing the friction that users have with getting whatever it is that they're searching for, whether it be a podcast, like one of The Motley Fool podcasts, or maybe it's an answer on what the weather is like, or something like that. But, a lot of time, it's ease of use. You look at something like Google's original search algorithm and how that brought the entire tech landscape and navigating the web into something that is simple and easy to find. A lot of what these smart home and more integrated solutions we're seeing from big tech names are doing is something similar, is a next layer on top of that, as I'm seeing at least. Erickson: Yeah, I completely agree with you. We've seen them launch the product first and then optimize it over time second, basically strategy model of these. Amazon wanted to get the Echo out, get it in your home. And it's not going to be able to do everything up front. In fact, it was very limited when they first launched it, but it's getting smarter. It's able to do more and more things. And I think in the future, we're going to see that more and more being based on transactions, rather than just playing music or asking what the temperature is, "Book me an Uber" or "Reorder me something on Amazon." I think that's the next wave that Amazon is going forward, and Google is going after a lot of data as well. Lewis: One of the things I thought was really interesting. I was talking with Fool.com writer Daniel Kline about this. He's a gadget head, loves everything, owns everything. He'll buy it so he can write an article about it -- he's that kind of guy. He said Amazon was very smart with what they've done with Echo, because they have started out with very limited functionality, and they nailed the execution on that functionality. Rather than maybe what we've seen with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)and Siri and some of those other assistant-style things, where the execution was wonky because it tried to do too much. So, it'll be interesting to see how these different tech companies, from a functionality perspective, and all the features they allow here, continue to develop that, because it seems like Amazon has been smart there in slowly rolling it out and building a ton of confidence in the capabilities of the device and the underlying software and then adding things as they're able to execute for users.  Erickson: Yeah, and it's a race right now. Do you really need to have Alexa and Google Home and everything else in your home? You probably don't. Maybe you could have them talk to each other and have an interesting conversation. But really, this is almost a winner-takes-all for your living room, which I think is very beneficial for whoever sells the most hardware devices. They're really going to win the data prize at the end. Lewis: Switching gears here, I know one thing that we're both very interested in is tech mergers and acquisitions, and what that might look like in 2017. There are a couple different factors that I think might play into this. Some numbers from Dealogic: According to their estimates, global technology targeted M&A in 2014 was around $300 billion. In 2015, it was nearly $700 billion. Year to date in 2016, it's around $530 billion. For context, 2006 to 2013, total M&A wasn't above $300 billion once. My projection here is that we will see tech M&A be more or less flat from 2016, maybe even go down. I don't think we're going to revisit that huge peak we had in 2015. A couple different factors here on my end. Do you have any thoughts on that? Erickson: Money's cheap. Lewis: Money's cheap. Erickson: What's the interest rate looked like the last several years, you know? Lewis: Exactly. Last week, the Fed announced it was raising rates for the second time in 10 years. Now, the federal funds rate, which is the baseline rate for overnight bank borrowing, is at 75 basis points (0.75%), which is up from 50 basis points. Fed officials indicated that they would be possibly interested in making up to three increases next year, which would obviously be more aggressive than they'd originally forecast. The market wasn't quite expecting that. Also, they project three hikes in 2018 and 2019. All of this is to say, it will probably get more expensive to borrow. Capital is not going to be as cheap as it has been in the past. I think that will make some of these acquisitions a little tougher, because very often they're financed by debt by some of these big companies. Erickson: It's an interesting dynamic. I would say, right now if you go back to the early 2000s, it was all about getting a website. First, we had pets.com and every other dot-com that you could possibly get out there because the internet was blossoming. Then, you look maybe seven or eight years after that, and it was all about mobile, and everybody wanted to be an app that was on your smartphone that you could access, and that was just completely the new business model. I think now we're actually kind of slowing down on producing new things, because we have kind of overwhelmed what consumers can reliably handle, as far as websites and apps. I think it's going to be much more about, how are they useful, and who's consolidating that data? I think that's the third phase of the internet we're about to start experiencing. Lewis: I think one of the other things that might play into what we see with M&A moving forward is, a lot of people look at the market right now and they see that it's fairly expensive, in historical terms. You look at the S&P 500's trailing P/E, it's in the mid to upper mid-20s. That's on the higher end when you look back over the past 90 years. Historically, it's high single digits to low 20s, with some outliers here and there. Obviously, these are all broad-stroke macro factors, and none of this scares me away from buying any individual companies. But it's good to be aware of the general atmosphere surrounding the market. I don't think you will continue to see the consolidation that you've seen, particularly in spaces like the semiconductor industry and things like that, simply because it's going to be more expensive to borrow, and valuations have already been pushed up because it's been so inexpensive to borrow for such a long time. There is a wrench, possibly, that could get thrown into this thought process. Erickson: Here we go. Lewis: You want to deliver it? This is your theory. The potential for a tax holiday could be a little bit disruptive with this line of thinking, right? Erickson: That's the wrench that gets thrown into the plan. The gloves are off, what's going to happen, if all of the sudden you can repatriate these billions of dollars that tech companies have had overseas into the U.S. for a reduced rate? That could change the entire dynamic, probably. Lewis: You wouldn't need the debt to be able to finance these types of acquisitions. Not that it would be a problem for a company like Apple or Microsoft to do that. But these are two companies that I believe 90% of their cash hoard is held overseas. For them to bring that back under current tax law, they would be taking a huge haircut to do it. So, they've been harvesting that money overseas, and basically just letting it sit in marketable securities. But, if they are granted a one-time special tax holiday by president elect Trump, obviously that would make it a lot easier for more deals to go through. Erickson: Would that make America great again? Lewis: It might. I don't know. It's hard for me to know. I am no politico. I am just a guy they decided to give a weekly podcast to. Erickson: Well, I'm glad that you started the reckless predictions for this. I do think the interesting part is, obviously, Trump has campaigned a lot about establishing jobs in America. Of course, tech is a huge source of jobs in this country. So, a tax holiday could theoretically provide a lot of that for him. Lewis: Yeah. And, I mean, to show his emphasis on the tech industry, they had that tech summit, was that last week? A lot of execs were there. I know Tim Cook was there. So, he's clearly appealing to that group of executives and that industry. It will be interesting to see what the follow-through is there. Obviously, like we said, it's something that could disrupt that process, and that line of thinking with M&A trajectories. But, something we won't know for sure, and just have to watch. Erickson: Indeed. Lewis: Any other things to watch for 2017? Anything on your dashboard? Erickson: Well, I have two reckless predictions for M&A. Lewis: Love it!  Erickson: This is the crystal that is always cloudy. We never know where it's actually going to hit or not. But just for the show, for you, Dylan, I came up with to reckless predictions of M&A acquisition that I could see happening in the future. Lewis: I appreciate that. And emphasis on reckless. Erickson: Yes. And any hate mail from our listeners, directly to your inbox, right? Lewis: Yes. That's dlewis@fool.com. Or industryfocus@fool.com, if you feel like hitting all of us! Erickson: These are, again, highly speculative. I don't recommend anybody go out and buy these based on this. But two things that I do see that are very interesting out there: My first reckless prediction in the tech M&A space is IBM (NYSE:IBM) acquiring Splunk. The reason being, IBM has been a company that has shown it's willing to change its business model so many times. It's reinvented itself so many times over the decades, successfully. And it recognizes in the healthcare space, in all of the spaces that Watson is playing in right now, it has to look at unstructured data. It has to look at the fuller context of what's going on in the data that we're trying to figure out X outcome to come out of. The leader right now, far and away, in unstructured data, is Splunk. IBM is trying to use Watson to improve the outcomes of the healthcare space. So, I would make that reckless prediction No. 1 in the M&A space. Lewis: All right, what's reckless prediction No. 2? Erickson: No. 2 is Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) buys Veeva Systems. Again, you have a non-compete clause here with Veeva having exclusive rights to the life sciences and healthcare industry, whereas Salesforce is focused on almost everything else for software as a service, improving sales efficiencies, and actually, Veeva's CEO came from Salesforce.com, has a great relationship with those guys, and is actually using Salesforce to power along the back-end architecture for that company. I think they've carved out a very profitable niche, and they've kept that great relationship with Salesforce. I think that's a natural fit, potentially, for the future. Lewis: I love that those were your two, because two that came to mind for me, these are companies we have discussed fairly recently on the Tech podcast, Twitter and Pandora. Very curious to see what happens with them in 2017, because Twitter, of course, went through that flurry of headlines about potentially being suited by, Salesforce was one of them, Marc Benioff, their CEO, seemed enamored with Twitter. But I know Disney was in the conversation at some point, I believe Microsoft was in the conversation at some point. It seemed like anyone with a decent amount of cash on hand was in the conversation. And Pandora recently in chats, potentially, with Sirius. I know there has been some speculation there, too. David Kretzmann and I did a show on them a couple weeks ago. So, I'm glad to see that you're bringing some fresh perspectives, those are truly reckless predictions, and ones that maybe a lot of people aren't thinking about right now. Erickson: Sure. Lewis: Glad to have you on. Anything else before I let you go, Simon? Erickson: I think that's it. We're obviously keeping a very close eye on the tech space in Motley Fool Explorer, and also MDP and Rule Breakers. It's an interesting time to be a tech investor. We've seen the valuations a lot higher than we've been used to. On the other side, these companies are doing some pretty innovative stuff out there. Continues to make our jobs very interesting and a lot of fun. Lewis: It's a lot of fun to talk about. I'm sure I'll have you on the show plenty of times in 2017. Erickson: Thanks for having me today, Dylan.  Lewis: Well, listeners, that does it for this episode of Industry Focus.

Google's Android VR platform explained Rik Henderson and Chris Hall6 January 2017VR Pocket-lint Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment When it comes to virtual reality, Google has been very active in getting cheap devices into people's hands, thanks to Google Cardboard, and even supplying them with plenty of content to view, through YouTube. In 2016 Google introduced Daydream, a new VR platform for Android devices that's built right into Android Nougat and supported by Google's own viewer hardware, the Daydream View. Here's everything you need to know about Daydream, a fresh take on mobile VR. Google What is Daydream? Daydream effectively simplifies access to virtual reality content on a mobile device. It comes in three key aspects. There is an optimal specification list that manufacturers must meet for a smartphone to be labelled Daydream-ready. There is a Google-made Daydream View VR headset, although multiple manufacturers could also build their own designs (as long as they meet Google's standards). And there is an all-in-one hub for VR content. Daydream Home is a one-stop shop where you can start virtual reality apps or view videos while wearing the headset itself. Google Daydream View preview: The Pixel-perfect VR experience? Why do we need Daydream? At present, virtual reality content is fragmented. It is available from different places, but rarely all accessible from the one central location. Anyone who's gone through the charade of watching 360-degree YouTube videos on a Samsung Gear VR will know what we mean. You have to jump through several hoops just to get to the content you want to view. Daydream is designed to solve that, at least for Android device owners. It will house the content from all mobile VR developers, no matter who they are. Sources big and small will be immediately accessible through the hub. In addition, while Google Cardboard has been a fun and easy device to use to get a flavour of what VR is about, it's hardly high-tech or, in many cases, comfortable. The Daydream View headset is a much more comfortable and practical approach, rather than the ad hoc nature of Cardboard viewers. Pocket-lint What devices will work with Daydream? Daydream viewers To use Daydream, you'll need a Daydream viewer of some sort. At the moment, the only Daydream headset available is Google's own Daydream View. As well as the Daydream View headset there is also a specific Daydream remote control, which comes with the Google device. It is designed by Google and enables users to interact with apps without having to tap the side of the headset - as in the case with the current Samsung Gear VR - or fiddling with other on-headset controls. Google Daydream View review: A Pixel-perfect VR experience? At the launch of Daydream, many partners were announced, with the likes of HTC, LG, Huawei and others listed. So far there's been no other viewers launched, although some details have been shared about the Huawei VR headset. There's no launch date on it, but we suspect it will be alongside a future phone, like the Huawei P10. This is Huawei's Daydream VR headset Google Daydream-compatible smartphones The list of manufacturers that have so-far committed to releasing Daydream-ready phones includes Samsung, HTC, LG, Xiaomi, Huawei, ZTE, Asus and Alcatel. To be classed as Daydream-ready, you need to conform to Google's guidelines, although many flagship devices will qualify in 2017. The following phones have been launched as Daydream ready, meaning you'll be able to use Daydream on these devices: Google Pixel (review) Google Pixel XL (review) Huawei Mate 9 Pro Porsche Design Mate 9 (preview) Moto Z (review) Asus ZenFone AR ZTE Axon 7 What apps will be compatible with Daydream? Many third-party app announcements are yet to be made, but Google launched a YouTube VR app and Daydream Keyboard. We also spotted Netflix VR, HBO Go and Hulu on the list, and the company revealed that an app based on JK Rowling's Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them will be coming too. There will be plenty of games too, of course. When is Daydream coming and how much will it cost? Google's Daydream View VR headset and accompanying remote control are available from Google's own online store. You will need a compatible smartphone to use the headset. Shipping started on 10 November in the UK, US and other countries. Priced at £69 in the UK, $79 in the US, Daydream View is available in slate, snow and crimson colours. The Daydream app also launched in the Google Play Store on 10 November. This app serves as the main hub for Daydream View headset. With it, you can find and play with Daydream-compatible apps installed on your phone. You will also have access to Google Play Store to download other apps and experiences. Before downloading the app, you may have to update your phone to the latest version of Android 7.1 Nougat.

Specifically, it turns out that a glitch first spotted in Android 6.0 Marshmallow and making it impossible for some people to connect to L2TP/IPsec VPNs still exists in Nougat, even though Google had more than one year to fix it. But let’s see how it all started in late 2015, why it persists in Android 7 Nougat, and how some people are trying to deal with it since Google doesn’t seem to be very keen on delivering a fix. What exactly is happening First and foremost, let’s go back to December 2015 when the first user reported the bug to Google after updating to Android 6.0 Marshmallow. A post on Google Code said the following: Unable to connect to L2TP/IPsec VPNs after upgrading to 6.0.1 on a Nexus 6 running MMB29K. No issues with L2TP/IPSec with 5.x. No issues with certain other (e.g. Cisco) VPN technologies. Other devices are able to connect to the same VPN servers I am testing. Servers are based on openswan/xl2tpd. This was just the beginning of a bug that’s now listed as “assigned,” considered to be “critical,” but somehow still not fixed in the latest versions of Android. Soon after the first message was posted on December 12, 2015, many other users turned to the same discussion to report the problem. One of the many users added: I have noticed the same issue after upgrading from 5.1.1 to 6.0.1 on both my Nexus 7 (flo) and Moto G2 (titan). (I am still able to access it with devices not updated to Marshmallow or not using Android.) I am trying to connect to a VPN on a TL-ER604W through L2TP/IPsec with PSK. So basically, what is happening after updating to Android 6.0 is that devices can no longer connect to L2TP/IPsec with PSK, even though everything was working perfectly fine in Android 5.0. For some reason, Android prefers users to switch to PPTP, which is a less secure protocol that many customers don’t want to use because of an obvious reason. For what it’s worth, Apple has removed PPTP support from iOS 10, choosing instead to force users to switch to L2TP/IPsec. The difference between iOS 10 and Android is that this protocol actually works on iPhones. In most of the cases, connecting to L2TP/IPsec fails with no detailed error message, and the unsuccessful message is provided after half a minute. Unless customers check server logs, it’s nearly impossible to determine why exactly the connection fails. The bug doesn’t seem to be limited to a specific smartphone brand or model, as users are reporting that Nexus, Samsung, Motorola, LG, and many other devices are affected. Still there in Nougat Of course, since it was first reported in December 2015, it’s only natural to expect the bug to be fixed in the recently-released Android Nougat. But… no, the bug is still there, so there still are plenty of users who cannot connect to their VPN networks because the “assigned” and “critical” glitch still hasn’t been fixed. One of the users who took to the aforementioned discussion says: I am still have the same problem on Pixel C and Nexus 6 running 7.0. It doesn't work on any of these devices running 6.0.1: LG G5, Nexus 6, Nexus 7 (2013), Galaxy S7, Gpad 8.3 (CM build), and Galaxy Note 5. We use these for running a business, and cannot afford to now wait until Android 8.0 is released. I had to buy a Oneplus X that is still on 5.1 just as a stop gap just to use VPN. In most of the cases, customers who also had a backup PPTP connection turned to this protocol as a workaround for the bug, while others installed the OpenVPN Connect app that’s available in the store. VPN connection options in Android Nougat The iPhone workaround Those who are super-frustrated with Google’s lack of response in the case of this bug that dates back to December 2015 decided to go for a more dramatic workaround: give up on Android and switch to iOS. I hit this issue last December. My fix was to buy Iphones for us all (okay, I'm a small business so it was only 4). They just work and we've had zero issues - with hindsight I have secured 6 months of productivity so it was a good decision. The number of users who decided to switch to iPhone just because of this bug is surprising to say the least, but you can’t blame anyone for wanting to connect to their corporate networks and do their jobs. And, as a conclusion, we’ll end with a message posted by a former Android customer who decided to abandon Android completely and purchase no less than 190 iPhones. In addition to the following message, he also posted the photo you can see below (whose legitimacy we can’t verify by the way) and which he says shows his company’s new phone lineup. Switched to Apple with 190 devices... Works like a charm now. 420 will follow. Waiting for a year is not acceptable.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Laptops Samsung’s new Chromebooks are the first to get stylus support Laptops Samsung’s new Chromebooks are the first to get stylus support By Bindu Nair - Jan 6, 2017 Samsung has launched the Chromebook Plus and Chromebook Pro at CES 2017, the latest additions to the series after a string of models were launched by various companies at the event. The South Korean brand’s own take on the laptops differs from the crowd by being the first to support a stylus. The Chromebook Plus and Chromebook Pro are the result of a collaboration between Samsung and Google. The two worked together to make laptops that were built for Google Play and its Android apps from the ground up. The duo additionally offer up a number of upgrades in the form of two USB-C ports for enhanced connectivity and 4K video streaming. Samsung has blessed the notebooks with a lightweight metal design which ensures it tips the scales at 1.08kg only. There’s also a 360-degree hinge to seamlessly switch between laptop and tablet mode. The 12.3-inch touchscreen outputs a quad HD resolution and lets users interact with it via a built-in digitized pen. Also Read: Samsung Galaxy S8 release date revealed The stylus is conveniently located on the side of the Chromebooks. The new pen features a 0.7mm tip and pressure sensitivity for more accurate screen capturing. Users can use pre-installed software like Google Keep and Samsung ArtCanvas for jotting down notes and drawing, respectively. Here’s a quick look at the top specifications of the Samsung Chromebook Plus/Pro: – OS: Google Chrome – Display: 12.3 -inch, 2400 x 1600 pixels – CPU: ARM/Intel Core M3 – Camera: 720p HD – Memory: 4GB RAM, 32GB storage – Battery: 3600mAh – Size: 280.8 x 221.6 x 12.9 – 13.9mm – Weight: 1.08kg – Connectivity: Wi-Fiac, Bluetooth 4.0, 2 x USB-C, microSD card reader The Samsung Chromebook Plus and Chromebook Pro appear to be identical in most respects except for the ARM processor used in the former and Intel Core M3 SoC powering the latter. The first is up for pre-orders here and has a $449.99 starting price tag, while the latter will emerge this Spring and doesn’t have a cost attached to it yet.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Mobile Phones Nexus 6 finally gets Android 7.1.1 Nougat update Mobile Phones Nexus 6 finally gets Android 7.1.1 Nougat update By Bindu Nair - Jan 6, 2017 The Nexus 6 is finally getting a taste of Android 7.1.1 Nougat about a month after the update was released. Google’s also begun rolling out the January Android security patches for Pixel and Nexus devices. The Nexus 6 is notably the oldest member of the series to be eligible for Android 7.1.1 Nougat. Google hasn’t disclosed why exactly the phone failed to receive the upgrade for so long, only saying that it had something to do with a last minute bug. Owners of the Nexus 6 will now receive the promotion to the latest version of the OS over-the-air. They can also opt to download a factory image or OTA file from the Google Developer site if they’re feeling impatient. The brand’s January security patch is presumably included in the update. Also Read: Google Pixel units shutting down at 30% battery The most severe issue which Google’s January upgrade resolves is a critical-level security vulnerability in Mediaserver which could allow an attacker to utilize a specially crafted file which brings about memory corruption during media and data processing. It’s been given a high rating because of the possibility of remote code execution taking place via methods like web browsing, email, and MMS. Google says it hasn’t received any reports of Android users getting hit by the problem. The security patch also fixes a privilege vulnerability in MediaTek components such as the thermal and video driver. The hole could allow hackers to enable a malicious application to execute arbitrary code. A similar susceptibility was found in Qualcomm’s camera as well. You can download factory images for your Nexus or Pixel device here and OTA files here.

Alphabet Inc's Google quickened the pace of its push into virtual and augmented reality this week as its hardware partners announced new devices featuring the company's technology at the CES electronics show in Las Vegas. Google has been trying to position the vast network of smartphones running its Android operating system for virtual and augmented reality, known as VR and AR, fields that many in the technology industry say are poised to go mainstream after years of niche appeal. Chinese manufacturer Huawei Technologies Co announced on Thursday that two of its phones will soon work with Daydream View, a VR headset released last year by Google. Meanwhile, Taiwanese manufacturer AsusTek Computer Inc announced that its ZenFone AR will support both Daydream and Google's Tango software for AR, in which computer-generated content is overlaid on the real world. While the announcements expand the line-up of participating phones, Google still has much to do to take its technology to the masses, said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research, noting that Samsung Electronics Co, the largest Android manufacturer, has yet to sign on. "Google's ecosystem for both AR and VR is in the very early days," he said. As growth in the global smartphone market shows signs of slowing, some manufacturers are voicing optimism that AR and VR will revive consumer enthusiasm. "This is the next wave of technology that is really going to get consumers excited about smartphones," Erik Hermanson, Asus's head of marketing for mobile products, said at the show. But mainstream consumer interest in the technology remains largely unproven. Apps might be expected to stimulate demand, but until Google's technology is available on a wider range of phones, it will be tough to persuade developers to build for the platform, analysts said. "We are waiting for app developers to really use the platform for what it's for," Amit Singh, a vice president for VR at Google, told reporters. In addition to supporting Daydream, Huawei said that it is exploring opportunities for Tango with Google. The Asus phone became the first to support both technologies. Google has stressed that the programs do not overlap for now, but by pursuing both, the company can position itself for success regardless of whether AR or VR becomes a mainstream hit. "By having options for both, they can cover the full potential market," said analyst Bob O'Donnell of TECHnalysis Research.

Here are my predictions and trends for 2017 which will both enhance and hinder the maturity of the conversion optimisation industry, and its application within businesses across the world. For more on this topic, check out these Econsultancy resources: Conversion Rate Optimization Report 2016 Conversion Rate Optimization Training 1. CRO goes mainstream (driven by Google Optimize) It was inevitable that Google would release a newly enhanced, powerful, free A/B testing tool and in 2016 the beta arrived. Much like the launch of Google Analytics provided a quantum leap in the amount of businesses across the world using web analytics data (caveat I am using the words “using web analytics data” loosely here), Google Optimize is also going to start bringing the concept of A/B testing to the masses. On the one hand, this is good news for the awareness and credibility of the conversion optimisation industry. Google’s rubber stamp (and an improved tool from its last effort) will mean that more people will be developing a culture of experimentation. On the other hand, the harsh reality is, when we get something for free, we typically place less value on its importance and the need to invest time and money into it. Google Analytics is one of the most powerful yet poorly configured and utilised tools in the digital industry. Google Optimize has the potential of joining its big brother, if all that it does is encourage more businesses and agencies to jump on the CRO bandwagon (and practice poor A/B testing based on egotism and opinion). Will SMEs understand the different statistical models they need to use to understand whether a variant on their testing tool is truly the winner? Will all businesses be able to configure their testing tool to their analytics and ensure the data they are recording is correct? Just as Google Optimize will help make the CRO industry visible, it will inevitably bring about poor practice and misinformation. Personally, I’m not prepared to let this happen. The CRO industry deserves to be valued by businesses as a core growth lever. Intelligent, customer-driven experimentation should be part of company DNA. I hope Google shares this view. 2. The proliferation of AI and machine learning The machines are coming to take all of our jobs! Machine learning is the future that we need to embrace today. In 2017, machine learning will take greater prominence in the conversion optimisation landscape. Is this a bad thing? It doesn’t have to be. AI can alleviate some of the day-to-day workload that conversion optimisation strategists and practitioners have, such as small design tweaks, traffic allocation and data analysis. It’s these functionalities that make me interested in what AI and machine learning can offer, just as long as businesses don’t neglect HI. Human Intelligence is more important now than ever. To match customer expectations, businesses want to create engaging and exciting online experiences and the only way to do that is through creativity and understanding. At this point, AI can’t replace these two human attributes. To truly draw value from machine learning, you still need to have a human behind the machine, ‘feeding’ it ideas, concepts and designs that have been built from user research and in-depth data analysis. That way, you can get more improvements and solutions in your online experience than you could manually and leave your optimisers and strategists to do what they do best: create. There is no getting away from the fact that AI is going to play an increasing role in our daily lives. The question is, do we just throw in the towel and leave all this to machines?  Personally, I’m going to keep hold of my towel for my next holiday. 3. Full spectrum A/B testing Very often, at the major growth and conversion optimisation conferences, thought-leading speakers mention “button testing” when sharing their experiences of how many businesses are still ‘conducting’ conversion optimisation. In A/B testing there is a full spectrum of test types for businesses to harness: Iterative: Smaller scale and quick to implement tests, that provide immediate commercial impact. Innovative: Comprehensive and bolder tests, which enhance the customer experience and generate significant commercial impact. Strategic: Tests designed to drive transformation of brand perception and proposition, alongside supporting long-term business growth aspirations. In 2017, we may see the complete flip in approach to A/B testing. Already, I’ve seen more businesses ask for bigger and bolder tests, thinking it will bring about a big result. As happy as I am to see businesses wanting to be more ambitious in their tests, sometimes, it can be a case of ‘the bigger they are, the harder they fall’. This is why it’s more important than ever to find the perfect blend of the three A/B test types listed above; sometimes a series of small tests might not shift the needle but instead, lead towards a larger, more innovative test that will and vice versa. The businesses that embrace the full spectrum of A/B testing will be the ones that see the dramatic changes in their business growth performance they’ve read about in all the blogs. 4. The realisation that culture really does eat strategy for breakfast in CRO Culture eats strategy for breakfast and this will be even more applicable in 2017 as many businesses begin to embrace a culture of experimentation through testing, and shift their focus from being product-led, to customer-led. The first of the four pillars of my Conversion Optimisation Maturity Model™ is Strategy & Culture. Within this pillar are assessment points looking at company mindset, strategic appreciation, having an influential champion, and planning long-term. You can have the latest and greatest tools, you can have a multi-disciplinary team made up of researchers, strategists, data analysts, UX designers and developers. You can have a process in place for how you develop intelligent hypotheses for running tests. However, if you don’t work on your company culture, at some stage, you will hit a mighty brick wall. Intelligent experimentation has to become a core part of the company DNA for it to succeed long term. 5. Less of ‘I know best’ or reliance on machine learning Throughout 2016 we have seen more and more content being pushed out there about customer experience, and I’m expecting this can only be a good thing.  If want to become truly customer-centric, you have speak to your customers one-on-one. Period. You have to respect the ideas and opinions of other people. When you do, ask them for their thoughts on the websites of your competitors. You may just find you get some invaluable, powerful insights which will make decision makers sit up and listen. As we expect business culture to evolve and embrace more experimentation in 2017, more decision makers will begin to harness the new HIPPO characteristics: Humility, Integrity, Passion, Positivity and Open-mindedness. The gap between your perception of how good your online experience is and what your customers actually think of your online experience can be huge. Bridge the gap between your products and your potential customers.. Face up to your fears that maybe your product, services or online experience needs some TLC and it will provide you with a more sustainable business. Evolve from being a product-led business, to becoming a customer-led business. Is the future bright for CRO in 2017? Amongst the heady mix of AI, machine learning, data clouds, Google Optimize and fixed mindsets within businesses, these five trends will be harnessed by the few brands who choose to step outside of their comfort zone. The question is, will your business step outside of its comfort zone? It is often where the magic really does happen.

See Offers Business Posted January 5 Updated January 5 increase font size In age of voice-activated products, live mics are also spying on you Devices like the Echo are always listening and storing data, which could come back to haunt its owners. By BREE FOWLER and MAE ANDERSON Associated Press Share Comment Read Article LAS VEGAS — Alexa, are you spying on me? It’s a fair question in light of attempts by authorities investigating the slaying of an Arkansas man to obtain voice recordings collected by an Amazon Echo speaker and its Alexa digital assistant. At a consumer electronics show in Las Vegas, the Olly personal assistant by Emotech is one of many voice-activated products. Associated Press/John Locher The LG Hub Robot & Mini are unveiled during a news conference Wednesday in Las Vegas. Associated Press/John Locher Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store → Yet the popularity and capabilities of voice-enabled products such as the Echo continue to grow. At the CES gadget show in Las Vegas, which opened Thursday, Whirlpool, Samsung and other manufacturers are unveiling new ways to use voice services to control laundry machines, refrigerators and other home systems. Consumers are apparently willing to trade a certain amount of privacy for convenience. So what exactly is being collected, stored or shared ? To work, the Echo is always listening. Once it hears someone utter a keyword, such as “Alexa,” it shares what it hears with Amazon’s servers to process a response. Those conversations are then stored indefinitely. Google’s Home speaker works in a similar fashion. The Echo “has to listen to everything. That’s kind of disturbing,” said Ryan O’Leary, vice president of WhiteHat Security’s threat research center. “It doesn’t capture voice until it hears the keyword, but it could. You’re trusting the devices to not do that, but it’s entirely possible.” In the Arkansas case, authorities investigating the death of a man found floating face-up in a hot tub at a friend’s home requested the contents of the home’s Echo and Amazon’s stored recordings in hopes they might contain evidence. The friend is charged with murder. A judge has signed off on the search, but Amazon has balked. It has declined to comment specifically on the case, but said the company objects to “overbroad or otherwise inappropriate demands as a matter of course.” Some experts worry that allowing such a search would erode people’s privacy. “It’s not necessarily a direct threat for the average person, but the same thing can be said with any kind of privacy concern,” O’Leary said. “People say you shouldn’t be concerned if you’re not doing anything wrong, but that’s a dangerous precedent to set.” Meanwhile, companies keep asking consumers to invite them into their homes. Whirlpool is adding Alexa voice control to its smart-home appliances, including a washing machine, a stove and a refrigerator. Someone can instruct the oven to pre-heat to 400 degrees by speaking a command to an Alexa-enabled device, such as the Echo. Simplehuman has a voice-activated trash can, and GE Lighting has a table lamp using Alexa voice control. For now, voice control is mainly an add-on feature rather than a core component of gadgets. It’s there for those who want to use it, but it’s not essential for the product to function. Many manufacturers are opting to use Amazon’s Alexa service for now, though some are embracing voice systems from Google, Apple or Samsung. Nvidia’s Shield TV-streaming device, for instance, employs Google’s Assistant service so viewers can control video playback or find out the weather with just a voice command. Meanwhile, Samsung’s new Family Hub lets people use their voice to add items to shopping lists and order groceries online. CES chief economist Shawn DuBravac said as many as 700 companies could announce Alexa-integrated products during the gadget show, on top of more than 1,500 existing ones. As the smart home becomes more entrenched, DuBravac said, voice control could change the way we interact with technology in much the way the mouse did in the 1980s. “Connected microphones are starting to appear in everything from cars to children’s toys,” said James Plouffe, lead solutions architect at mobile-security company MobileIron. “Consumers should think carefully about how comfortable they are with the prospect of a live mic in common household items.” Because Amazon says it uses information gathered by the Echo to improve its voice technology, that information has the potential to “live forever” online, Plouffe said. The issue first grabbed headlines a couple of years ago, after Samsung said sensitive conversations could be captured by its voice-controlled smart TVs. Based on the flood of new voice-controlled gadgets headed to market, tech companies are betting that consumers will get over their fears. Derrick Dicol, executive director of Comcast’s Xfinity home, which uses voice controls in its home automation products, noted that people had to get used to sharing their banking information online. “This is less invasive than that,” he said. “It’s just a different thing people have to feel comfortable with.” Share Read or Post Comments Were you interviewed for this story?

About Techzim Contact Us Send a Tip Menu About Techzim Contact Us Send a Tip Search advertisement Homepage » Hardware & Software » Why I uninstalled Microsoft Office from my computer Why I uninstalled Microsoft Office from my computer Posted 6 Jan 2017 by Garikai Dzoma (@gdzoma) Read 18 Comments Truth be told I sort of tolerate the Windows Operating system for various reasons including the fact that it has better multimedia driver support and most accessories have plug and play support, while in my beloved Ubuntu I might have to go into the terminal to figure things out. Most importantly it’s the only way I can use Microsoft Office without having to pay Bill every other month. In the old days, all I had to do was buy a new laptop flip the lid, remove crapware that comes preloaded, install an antivirus and then I was good to go. Now things are decidedly different. I had to struggle to gain limited control on how I received my updates. Removing some of the useless applications like MSN Sports and other useless bandwidth hogging parts was unnecessarily hard. Office, it seems, is no longer preactivated To top all that off it seems the preinstalled version of Office that came with the laptop was not even activated! And that is where the trouble began. A tale of confusing licences Since I have sworn off pirated software I decided to find out how much it would cost me to get a licence. The array of licences available is mind-numbing and confusing. There are SPLA, FFP, OEM (I knew was not looking for this right away), USL and of course Volume Licensing where I have to pay Bill every month/year. advertisement After deciding I didn’t really want to spend an eye-popping $290 – families live off that kind of money- to buy glorified text editor I decided to have a look at volume licensing which looked cheaper. Only to be confronted by another endless iteration of options and tables. Later I discovered I had to pay $99 a year for the trouble of having One Note on my desktop. Then it got me thinking. Do I really need Office anymore? Do you really need Office? Like I said above there was a time when Ms Office was the mainstay of every office big and small. Google Docs was not even considered an alternative, it was clunky, lacked essential features, terrorised Internet Explorer and stretched it to its limits, required a very good internet connection and produced documents that were not exactly compatible. That was then. Now, Google Docs is a rival that Ms Office products have to contend with. While for nostalgic reasons people still tend to stick to Ms Office I don’t think the experience is worth the $99 a year experience. Add the fact that sometimes I just want to work from any device without being shackled by the fact that the demi-gods at Microsoft could not be bothered to port Office to it, Google Docs became a viable alternative. The last straw was when the Office Update Utility started chewing through my limited bandwidth in the middle of the day rendering my connection unusable. So I said no to Microsoft and decided to avail to Google one more facet of my life. Now the damn thing knows where I stay, the weather, what I look like, where I have been and just about everything else. Creepily it tells me when it’s time to go to work and alerts me when my secret football team is taking a thrashing. Getting some new love Prior to this change, I had only used Google Docs occasionally. While it takes time to get used to the interface the experience is not unpleasant. One feature that takes some getting used to is the autosave feature. You type something and it is saved almost instantly without hitting Ctrl + S. If you feign a British or American accent then there is voice typing to give your fingers a rest but it seems for all its omniscience Google still struggles to spell Tapiwa. You also get access to common fonts such as Calibri plus the shipload of Google’s famous web safe fonts. A word of warning using these fonts would require the person to whom you are sending the document to, to download the fonts if they are using an offline document viewer such as Ms Office 2013 to view the document properly. The interface is uncluttered and distraction free allowing your to focus on the task at hand. You can also Google search to include links or find the meanings of various words, use a thesaurus and most importantly share and collaborate with others with ease. I am sure Ms Office’s cloud offerings have features to match these and to be fair but Google Docs comes with free 15 GB storage and if I want a paid version I have to pay $5 a month without going through a licensing ballet. I don’t even have to think about back-ups anymore. You can also extend Google Docs using many of the offered add-ons. For the first time, I can spell the word café the way it’s supposed to be spelt without going through hoops. Don’t believe me? Try spelling MØ in Word. The internet catch One serious drawback of using Google Drive is that you need a constant and decent internet connection otherwise you will go bald as you constantly pull out your hair in frustration. Sure you can edit a document offline for a while but the suit is supposed to be used online. A counter-argument can be made that Ms Office requires regular large updates to be downloaded and applied which means an internet connection would still be required but it will not stop working even if you don’t update it so. Also while their version of Excel (it’s really called a spreadsheet) is decent when it comes to advanced features it’s just crap. It cannot even properly import CVS files generated by Google themselves which is pretty embarrassing. You could also check LibreOffice LibreOffice is touted as a FOSS Ms Office alternative. Personally, I don’t believe that at all. I personally detest it myself but some people swear by it. So if you do not have a constant internet connection you can try that route. Stay away from OpenOffice while you are at it. It receives less frequent updates and I can predict its ultimate demise in the next coming months or years. Last words To be clear I did not uninstall Office because it was terrible, it just that for me, and I would guess for most people, there is really no compelling reason to choose it above its competitors anymore. That, plus Google Docs is pretty awesome you should give it a try. share Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Tags: Google, Microsoft Office, office 365 Previous Post « Some light at the end of the tunnel for local gamers.

Notepad++ and you’re in heaven. This ‘Everybody Hates Microsoft’ mantra is getting old. We all know the alternatives are all trying to replicate Windows and MS Office with laughable results. We use Google for Business in our company for email and storage requirements, and we get all sorts of issues with missing files, failed syncs, you-name-it. We miss the features of Outlook and Google deliberately killed compatibility with Outlook for their enterprise email service. The truth of the matter is the world runs on Windows and Microsoft deserves some credit for that Reply Garikai Dzoma says: January 6, 2017 at 11:23 AM Read again slowly this time. My uninstalling Office has nothing to do with hating Microsoft. I run bash in Windows! I and a lot of ppl cannot afford it Reply Tsenny says: January 6, 2017 at 12:01 PM PS: Volume Licensing From my experience with Volume Licensing, its is just a term most usually for organisations whereby an organisation requires multiple licenses of the Microsoft product eg the MS Office, but they do not require multiple copies of the installation media. It is cheap in the sense that you get only 1 DVD but your license can have the number of activations or seats that you require e.g for 50 users. That is how the cheapness comes about in that they do not need to ship to you 50 DVDs. What you are actually referring to as having to pay a bill every month if I am not mistaken is Office365. Reply Tsenny says: January 6, 2017 at 12:05 PM For MS Office Licenses, the licenses are perpertual and what you expires every 24 months is the Software Assurance which gives you the ability to upgrade to a new version if Microsoft brings in a new version of the software and your Software Assurance is still valid. Yes Microsoft licensing is confusing Reply Lawrence says: January 6, 2017 at 12:38 PM Thanks Tsenny and EMC. Sometimes I feel the articles on TECHZim, while aimed at addressing some tech issue, lack sufficient investigation that would make them more informative. They end up sounding like posts on a personal blog where there is no editorial moderation. And for some of us, being non-core techies, we will be hoping to read insightful articles on tech as it affects us, how we can make it easier to use, general news, etc. Like how Tsenny just described MS Office licensing in 2 short paragraphs, leaving me with sufficient detail that at least the amount I spend will be once off, but the licensing is confusing. And to the writer, from a PR point of view, “never tell a person who has taken the time to read your writing that they should “read again more slowly this time”. It’s rude. I am saying this from the point of view of both a writer, reader and consumer. Reply Garikai Dzoma says: January 6, 2017 at 1:10 PM Sigh, I apologize for being insensitive, too much time at Stack Exchange and hacker forums where you speak your mind next time I will buy a candle and we will hug it out. I am not speaking for the editor but when I write, and for most tech blogs like ZDNet, Techcrunch, Wired and a gazillion others out there, each writer has his/her little nook and cranny. We know for example that Ernesto from torrentfreak hates the DCMA, Joey from OMGUbuntu loves his cat etc it’s just how it is. I cannot, and will never write about something that I don’t know. I will never even pretend to be unbiased, that is a Western media fiction just compare Fox News and ABC for example and you will know there is never such a thing as a balanced opinion. The point of the article was Ms Office licensing is expensive and stupid compared to how they used to do it. The caustic remark was meant to point out the fact that I was talking about Word Processing and the comment is telling me to use Notepad ! and Notepad++. For the record I use Sublime Text and Atom whenever I need a text editor. Now I will admit I have done it myself countless times: I see the title and scroll down to the comment section to leave a comment without even reading the article. Reply surur says: January 6, 2017 at 7:16 PM The licensing is only confusing because Garikai was looking for a work around to paying full price. For consumers there are really only two options – 1) pay full price for the boxed copy or 2) pay for Office 365 Home. All the other licensing models are for schools and businesses or PC builders, and are not intended for regular consumers. This is the same ridiculous complaint we see about there being 11 versions of Windows . Windows Server is not for granny at home. She either gets Windows with her PC, buys a boxed copy in the store (where there will only be Pro and Home) or purchase an upgrade from the online store, where there will only be Pro and Home. Reply TheKing says: January 6, 2017 at 12:50 PM WPS is the best Microsoft Office alternative for Linux. WPS Writer matches or is actually better than Word. Reply Garikai Dzoma says: January 6, 2017 at 1:12 PM No argument here. It’s just I cannot afford it anymore. Reply Lennon says: January 6, 2017 at 1:12 PM I am selling Microsoft Office 2016 Pro Plus activation key only for $35. Reply Macd Chip says: January 6, 2017 at 2:26 PM I have read this and as someone who buys MS Office (Full Pro) almost every month, l can say this is not clearly explained, its a mixed bag of ideas. We need to clearly distinguish which office we are talking about! Is it online office or offline office. Its a rule, if you are using SaaS, the features are limited compared to offline. One such SaaS is MS Office 365. Licensing can be cheap because you can rent it when you need it, and stop when you do not want it. I have both Libre Office and MS Pro on my PC, l still believe Libre is the easier no brainer replacement for MS offline installations. Reply Lawrence says: January 6, 2017 at 3:38 PM Exactly my point.. the original article is going everywhere else except somewhere specific. Have found more insight from the comments section than the original article. That being said, being a technocrat in an area and supping with the Techcrunch, Google or any of those big guys does not make one a good article writer. One should invest time in learning how to write effectively. Reply NdiniNdadaro says: January 6, 2017 at 2:55 PM I use cracked version much like Rhodes took the land without paying. Reply Macd Chip says: January 6, 2017 at 3:30 PM cracked version on works for offline usage, the day it will call home is the day you will kiss it goodbye Reply Tom says: January 7, 2017 at 2:29 AM TechZim, your articles are becoming poorer and poorer by the day. Everytime i read ur articles since u decided to diversify from being a tech only site i am disappointed. Guys u r putting too much off ur emotions and little research in the topic at hand. Your articles are now more of click bait than informative. What have i learned from your article? i hv learned that u dont like that Microsoft dorminates the word editor space. while its ur opinion u didnt fully research on how to get a licence to use Office and which type of user each license suits , u just complained how u dont want to pay money to use Office. this article is good for a teenage blog not a site which aims to inform people. In a nutshell, too much self opinion less facts (this has bn happening for some time ) Reply peterc says: January 7, 2017 at 9:37 AM LibreOffice user here. Not the best thing since sliced bread but it solves most of my problems. Reply Joe says: January 8, 2017 at 10:17 AM I’ve been using Google docs extensively over the last few years. But here is one simple example of many as to why you should not get rid of word and rely solely on Google docs. Write a simple 5 page document in Google docs. Now go to page 3 of the document and start page numbering on that page instead. You won’t be able to. Google states it. There are several simple things like that are missing in docs that is infuriating. I always end up going back to word.

Huawei, the number three manufacturer in volume after Samsung and Apple, needs to innovate more than the top two players to achieve this goal. Published: 16:40 January 6, 2017 Naushad K. Cherrayil, Staff Reporter   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE Las Vegas: Richard Yu, CEO of Huawei’s consumer business group, said that the company hopes to go from its current number three position to number two smartphone manufacturer within a year or two. During his keynote speech at CES 2017, he said that the company never hides its ambitions. “We have the vision to make the world’s best smartphone, and smartphones which incorporate in-depth abilities in artificial intelligence (AI) might be considered intelligent phones.” “Such devices may incorporate computer vision, robotics, air sensors, taste sensors, local decision-making and smart touch to communicate with the world around it. These AI-based devices provide a connection between the digital world and the physical world,” he said. Huawei, the number three manufacturer in volume after Samsung and Apple, needs to innovate more than the top two players to achieve this goal. As smartphone manufacturers continue to develop the internet of things, he said that such intelligent phones may become an even more integral part of how mobile devices are used as a hub for connectivity between several other smart devices. With this in mind, Huawei has teamed up with Google’s Daydream virtual reality project and Amazon’s Alexa voice service. Huawei also announced that its Mate 9 phone will be available in the US for $599 (Dh2,200) and will have Alexa voice service. Existing Mate 9 owners will be able to access the service via an over-the-air update by end of first quarter. During his speech, he took aim at Apple several times and said that Mate 9 is thinner than the iPhone 7, has a longer battery life and faster charging time. Huawei was also the first phone to sport dual cameras like the iPhone 7. Amit Singh, a lead of business and operations at Google’s VR/AR team, officially announced that Huawei Mate 9 Pro and Mate 9 Porsche Design will be the next phones to have a Daydream VR platform. The current Daydream-compatible phones are Google Pixel and Pixel XL, Moto Z and Z Droid, Asus ZenFone AR, and ZTE Axon 7. Singh said that Google is working to bring the platform’s AR capabilities [Tango] to future Huawei devices. “What we found is building smartphones for VR is a lot of work. It requires a close partnership deep at the engineering level to design the right optics, display technologies, sensors,” said Singh. “We’ve actually worked very closely with Huawei to optimise performance on the Kirin chip set. It’s really an industry-leading chip which I think will bring choice to consumers and give us really immersive computing, which is especially more than VR.” He said that Google is working very closely with Huawei, just like in VR, to bring augmented reality to Huawei’s line-up using Tango technology for motion tracking, AI learning and depth perception. Huawei has also created their own Daydream VR headset based on the Daydream View reference design. Executives from both Google and Amazon said that there is even more to come in partnership with Huawei, including a Google augmented reality feature and more Alexa features. Yu said that Huawei is also aiming to be the world’s biggest spender in research and development in the next couple of years as Huawei is pouring resources into its own chips, machine learning and artificial intelligence, to conserve power and keep the Android platform from slowing down over time. Huawei spent $9.2 billion on R&D in 2016 and $38 billion for the last 10 years. “Our company is a different management style than other companies. We call it collective wisdom. We are not only diligent but we are also flexible,” he said.

Google Acquires Limes Audio for Improving Voice Quality in Hangouts GO Limes Audio focuses on improving the quality of voice calls Jan 6, 2017 13:12 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Google recently announced in a blog post that it acquired Swedish company Limes Audio, which focuses on bringing solutions for improving the quality of voice calls. The company was created 10 years ago and it has offices in Umeå, Sweden, as well as Stockholm and Palo Alto. Google is now focusing on providing a great audio experience to its video conferencing solutions, including Google Hangouts. “With G Suite customers now relying on video communications for their day-to-day meetings, it's more important than ever to ensure low-cost, high-quality audio,” the blog post reads. The company said that a poor Internet connection can affect the quality of video calls, which is why Google is now relying on Limes to find solutions for such issues. Limes Audio has been working on creating solutions for removing distortion and echoes that can affect online video and telephony calls. Limes Audio will be providing solutions for improved voice call quality Limes Audio also announced the deal in a post on its website saying that the company plans to “continue to work towards all voice conversations sounding equally loud and clear, regardless of the distance or environment.” The terms of the deal with Google haven’t been disclosed. This isn’t the first time that Google buys a startup company from Sweden. A few years ago, the tech giant acquired Marratech, a Swedish communications company. Google aimed at improving Google Talk and Hangouts with this acquisition. At the time, Hangouts was one of the main video-chatting apps for Android phones, but it has since been replaced by Duo within the suite of core GMS apps. Hangouts has been transformed into a business communications platform, while Duo would assist end users in placing video calls. One of the main advantages of Duo is represented by its features that prevent the app from dropping the call when Wi-Fi or network connectivity is lacking. #Google#Hangouts#Duo#Limes Audio#Video call quality subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google Adds More Phones to Daydream Family Including Asus ZenFone AR, ZTE Axon 7 Samsung Details Its Own January Android Security Update Meet “Vapor,” Misfit's First Touchscreen Smartwatch Google Releases January Security Patch for Nexus and Pixel Devices It's Now Possible to Use openSUSE Inside Windows 10, Here's How to Install It Barnes & Noble Halts Sales of Nook Tablets Due to Faulty Chargers Android Co-Founder Andy Rubin Working on a Premium Bezel-less Smartphone Lenovo Confirms New Moto Smartphones Will Be Unveiled at MWC 2017 Linus Torvalds Announces Fourth Linux 4.10 Kernel Release Candidate, Get It Now Debian Outs First Release Candidate of Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch" Installer Sony G3112 and G3221 Smartphones Coming Soon with MediaTek Helio P20 CPUs Linux Kernel 4.9.4 Released with Various ARM/ARM64 and Networking Improvements    Google Hangouts logo New Android APKs imo APK: Updated January 15th, 18:31 GMT AndroDumpper APK: Updated January 15th, 18:29 GMT MCPE Master APK: Updated January 15th, 18:27 GMT SuperSU APK: Updated January 15th, 18:24 GMT Geekbench 4 APK: Updated January 15th, 18:20 GMT Xbox Beta APK: Updated January 15th, 18:17 GMT Action Launcher 3 APK: Updated January 15th, 18:14 GMT Reader comments Qualcomm Says Nokia Phone Caught on Video at CES Is a Reference Design Device more on: Nokia 8 i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

Image Credit: Google Play Store 4 By Rehan Hooda /  06 Jan 2017 , 18:39 Personal security has always been a major concern for women in India, and various potential solutions have been discussed on how technology can be incorporated to solve the problem. Technology only covers a part of the larger picture and a larger social transformation is required. Regardless the conversation, we will cover how technology can help on that front, the best apps that can help you do it and the potential pitfalls that we have observed in the implementation. A number of smartphone apps have been introduced in this space, as the smartphone adoption grew in India. Most of the apps were launched as part of a social campaign or were part of an advertising campaign. But the main issue with most of the apps is the fact that they are not updated frequently. During my research on the apps that can help women tackle the important issue of personal safety, I found a lot of outdated apps. Apps that were last updated in 2015 or late 2014, apps that no longer function or are unstable, and user feedback has pointed out unpredictable nature of the apps. I have excluded the apps that no longer work and are not maintained by they developers so that users don’t encounter any issues while using the apps. Though, the stability of the apps depends on their compatibility with your smartphone setup. 1. Trusted Contacts Image Credit: Google Play Store Trusted Contacts is the latest app launched by Google. The app is straightforward, as it lets you choose trusted contacts and these contacts are notified about the same. One important thing to note is that the other user needs to install the same app if they want to request your location. The app lets trusted contacts request your location and the location notification comes in the UI design of a phone call. If the user does not respond in 5 minutes, then the app automatically shares the location to that trusted contact and also allows the trusted users to check phone’s activity. Even though the idea, compatibility and design of the app are the best in the list, still the implementation can be improved. The company needs to do away with the request timeout feature because the user is aware of the fact that trusted contacts can request your location. 2. My Safetipin: Personal Safety and SafetiPin Track: GPS Tracker Image Credit: Google Play Store My Safetipin is one of the smartest apps on Google Play Store which serves as a database of information for locations around you. It lets you enter details like Lighting available in the area, your Visibility to other people so that people can check on you, the diversity of crowd in terms of number of women and children around, the density of crowd in the area, distance from nearby public transport, presence of proper place to walk, availability of police or private security nearby and openness of the place. However, the most important thing is the ‘feeling’ field where you can enter how you feel about your safety in the particular location. The app comes with another companion app which gives options like ‘Stay with me’ which allows family and friends to track you, ‘Call back’ option that will make the phone ring in few minutes to help you get out of a situation, ‘Call me’ asks friends and family to call you, ‘Scream’ where the smartphone plays a loud noise to scare off people following you or trying to harass you. Other options include ‘Where are you’ where you can see locations of your friends and family members, ‘SOS’ that triggers a loud alarm on the smartphones belonging to your friends and family. 3. Himmat Image Credit: Google Play Store Himmat is the official app developed by Delhi Police where the user is required to register in the app using an OTP. This registration registers you with the Himmat backend which is monitored by the Police control room. The audio and video from the mobile device are sent to Police control room as soon as a user activates SOS alert from the app which allows police to send assistance request to nearest Police station or PCR van in the area. Keep in mind that there are two identical app listings in the Google Play Store. The first listing is ‘Himmat’ which is outdated and the latest updated listing is ‘Himmat.’ 4. Smart24x7-Personal Safety App Image Credit: Google Play Store The smart24x7 app is currently supported by Gurgaon Police, Jalandhar Police, Chandigarh Police, Jammu Police, Mohali Police, UP Fire Services (Lucknow and Noida). It allows users to send alerts to friends or family using the ‘PANIC’ button in case of any emergency. In case the GPRS or mobile data of the device is not working then the app will switch to SMS to send alerts. The app has 24×7 call centre assistant feature, voice and video recording during an emergency that will be sent to the police, fake call, tracking, sharing travel alerts and maid/servant registration with the police. They recently added a new feature that keeps your friends and family informed when you are on your way to the office or home. 5. Eyewatch Women, Eyewatch Aman, and Eyewatch BlackBox Image Credit: Google Play Store Eyewatch is a suite of apps developed by a developer group ‘Eyewatch’, and different apps have different features. The apps like Eyewatch Women, Eyewatch Aman and Eyewatch BlackBox have important functionalities like tracking, fake calling, emergency contact to your family and friends. The developer or the group developing should club all the apps to make once a consolidated app that can be maintained while offering all the features that are spread over multiple apps. Conclusion One important issue is that most apps are not well developed with system level integration. It requires low-level access app that can map hardware keys for instant actions and the apps can’t be installed directly. Even though, developing such apps will require significant coding skills, such apps should be mandatory for issues of personal safety. Developers should note that these apps don’t generate any revenue but if any developer comes with a consolidated, well maintained and modern app that includes a monthly subscription then people will pay to use that app. People will choose personal safety over not paying for a smartphone app. One thing to note is that the Government of India has ordered smart manufacturers to integrate emergency button or panic button in the smartphone software. Most smartphones have already rolled out updates to add that functionality. This move by the government is a huge step in the right direction.

See Offers Business Posted January 5 Updated January 5 increase font size In age of voice-activated products, live mics are also spying on you Devices like the Echo are always listening and storing data, which could come back to haunt its owners. By BREE FOWLER and MAE ANDERSON Associated Press Share Comment Read Article LAS VEGAS — Alexa, are you spying on me? It’s a fair question in light of attempts by authorities investigating the slaying of an Arkansas man to obtain voice recordings collected by an Amazon Echo speaker and its Alexa digital assistant. At a consumer electronics show in Las Vegas, the Olly personal assistant by Emotech is one of many voice-activated products. Associated Press/John Locher The LG Hub Robot & Mini are unveiled during a news conference Wednesday in Las Vegas. Associated Press/John Locher Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store → Yet the popularity and capabilities of voice-enabled products such as the Echo continue to grow. At the CES gadget show in Las Vegas, which opened Thursday, Whirlpool, Samsung and other manufacturers are unveiling new ways to use voice services to control laundry machines, refrigerators and other home systems. Consumers are apparently willing to trade a certain amount of privacy for convenience. So what exactly is being collected, stored or shared ? To work, the Echo is always listening. Once it hears someone utter a keyword, such as “Alexa,” it shares what it hears with Amazon’s servers to process a response. Those conversations are then stored indefinitely. Google’s Home speaker works in a similar fashion. The Echo “has to listen to everything. That’s kind of disturbing,” said Ryan O’Leary, vice president of WhiteHat Security’s threat research center. “It doesn’t capture voice until it hears the keyword, but it could. You’re trusting the devices to not do that, but it’s entirely possible.” In the Arkansas case, authorities investigating the death of a man found floating face-up in a hot tub at a friend’s home requested the contents of the home’s Echo and Amazon’s stored recordings in hopes they might contain evidence. The friend is charged with murder. A judge has signed off on the search, but Amazon has balked. It has declined to comment specifically on the case, but said the company objects to “overbroad or otherwise inappropriate demands as a matter of course.” Some experts worry that allowing such a search would erode people’s privacy. “It’s not necessarily a direct threat for the average person, but the same thing can be said with any kind of privacy concern,” O’Leary said. “People say you shouldn’t be concerned if you’re not doing anything wrong, but that’s a dangerous precedent to set.” Meanwhile, companies keep asking consumers to invite them into their homes. Whirlpool is adding Alexa voice control to its smart-home appliances, including a washing machine, a stove and a refrigerator. Someone can instruct the oven to pre-heat to 400 degrees by speaking a command to an Alexa-enabled device, such as the Echo. Simplehuman has a voice-activated trash can, and GE Lighting has a table lamp using Alexa voice control. For now, voice control is mainly an add-on feature rather than a core component of gadgets. It’s there for those who want to use it, but it’s not essential for the product to function. Many manufacturers are opting to use Amazon’s Alexa service for now, though some are embracing voice systems from Google, Apple or Samsung. Nvidia’s Shield TV-streaming device, for instance, employs Google’s Assistant service so viewers can control video playback or find out the weather with just a voice command. Meanwhile, Samsung’s new Family Hub lets people use their voice to add items to shopping lists and order groceries online. CES chief economist Shawn DuBravac said as many as 700 companies could announce Alexa-integrated products during the gadget show, on top of more than 1,500 existing ones. As the smart home becomes more entrenched, DuBravac said, voice control could change the way we interact with technology in much the way the mouse did in the 1980s. “Connected microphones are starting to appear in everything from cars to children’s toys,” said James Plouffe, lead solutions architect at mobile-security company MobileIron. “Consumers should think carefully about how comfortable they are with the prospect of a live mic in common household items.” Because Amazon says it uses information gathered by the Echo to improve its voice technology, that information has the potential to “live forever” online, Plouffe said. The issue first grabbed headlines a couple of years ago, after Samsung said sensitive conversations could be captured by its voice-controlled smart TVs. Based on the flood of new voice-controlled gadgets headed to market, tech companies are betting that consumers will get over their fears. Derrick Dicol, executive director of Comcast’s Xfinity home, which uses voice controls in its home automation products, noted that people had to get used to sharing their banking information online. “This is less invasive than that,” he said. “It’s just a different thing people have to feel comfortable with.” Share Read or Post Comments Were you interviewed for this story?

Most importantly it’s the only way I can use Microsoft Office without having to pay Bill every other month. In the old days, all I had to do was buy a new laptop flip the lid, remove crapware that comes preloaded, install an antivirus and then I was good to go. Now things are decidedly different. I had to struggle to gain limited control on how I received my updates. Removing some of the useless applications like MSN Sports and other useless bandwidth hogging parts was unnecessarily hard. Office, it seems, is no longer preactivated To top all that off it seems the preinstalled version of Office that came with the laptop was not even activated! And that is where the trouble began. A tale of confusing licences Since I have sworn off pirated software I decided to find out how much it would cost me to get a licence. The array of licences available is mind-numbing and confusing. There are SPLA, FFP, OEM (I knew was not looking for this right away), USL and of course Volume Licensing where I have to pay Bill every month/year. advertisement After deciding I didn’t really want to spend an eye-popping $290 – families live off that kind of money- to buy glorified text editor I decided to have a look at volume licensing which looked cheaper. Only to be confronted by another endless iteration of options and tables. Later I discovered I had to pay $99 a year for the trouble of having One Note on my desktop. Then it got me thinking. Do I really need Office anymore? Do you really need Office? Like I said above there was a time when Ms Office was the mainstay of every office big and small. Google Docs was not even considered an alternative, it was clunky, lacked essential features, terrorised Internet Explorer and stretched it to its limits, required a very good internet connection and produced documents that were not exactly compatible. That was then. Now, Google Docs is a rival that Ms Office products have to contend with. While for nostalgic reasons people still tend to stick to Ms Office I don’t think the experience is worth the $99 a year experience. Add the fact that sometimes I just want to work from any device without being shackled by the fact that the demi-gods at Microsoft could not be bothered to port Office to it, Google Docs became a viable alternative. The last straw was when the Office Update Utility started chewing through my limited bandwidth in the middle of the day rendering my connection unusable. So I said no to Microsoft and decided to avail to Google one more facet of my life. Now the damn thing knows where I stay, the weather, what I look like, where I have been and just about everything else. Creepily it tells me when it’s time to go to work and alerts me when my secret football team is taking a thrashing. Getting some new love Prior to this change, I had only used Google Docs occasionally. While it takes time to get used to the interface the experience is not unpleasant. One feature that takes some getting used to is the autosave feature. You type something and it is saved almost instantly without hitting Ctrl + S. If you feign a British or American accent then there is voice typing to give your fingers a rest but it seems for all its omniscience Google still struggles to spell Tapiwa. You also get access to common fonts such as Calibri plus the shipload of Google’s famous web safe fonts. A word of warning using these fonts would require the person to whom you are sending the document to, to download the fonts if they are using an offline document viewer such as Ms Office 2013 to view the document properly. The interface is uncluttered and distraction free allowing your to focus on the task at hand. You can also Google search to include links or find the meanings of various words, use a thesaurus and most importantly share and collaborate with others with ease. I am sure Ms Office’s cloud offerings have features to match these and to be fair but Google Docs comes with free 15 GB storage and if I want a paid version I have to pay $5 a month without going through a licensing ballet. I don’t even have to think about back-ups anymore. You can also extend Google Docs using many of the offered add-ons. For the first time, I can spell the word café the way it’s supposed to be spelt without going through hoops. Don’t believe me? Try spelling MØ in Word. The internet catch One serious drawback of using Google Drive is that you need a constant and decent internet connection otherwise you will go bald as you constantly pull out your hair in frustration. Sure you can edit a document offline for a while but the suit is supposed to be used online. A counter-argument can be made that Ms Office requires regular large updates to be downloaded and applied which means an internet connection would still be required but it will not stop working even if you don’t update it so. Also while their version of Excel (it’s really called a spreadsheet) is decent when it comes to advanced features it’s just crap. It cannot even properly import CVS files generated by Google themselves which is pretty embarrassing. You could also check LibreOffice LibreOffice is touted as a FOSS Ms Office alternative. Personally, I don’t believe that at all. I personally detest it myself but some people swear by it. So if you do not have a constant internet connection you can try that route. Stay away from OpenOffice while you are at it. It receives less frequent updates and I can predict its ultimate demise in the next coming months or years. Last words To be clear I did not uninstall Office because it was terrible, it just that for me, and I would guess for most people, there is really no compelling reason to choose it above its competitors anymore. That, plus Google Docs is pretty awesome you should give it a try. share Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Tags: Google, Microsoft Office, office 365 Previous Post « Some light at the end of the tunnel for local gamers.

Notepad++ and you’re in heaven. This ‘Everybody Hates Microsoft’ mantra is getting old. We all know the alternatives are all trying to replicate Windows and MS Office with laughable results. We use Google for Business in our company for email and storage requirements, and we get all sorts of issues with missing files, failed syncs, you-name-it. We miss the features of Outlook and Google deliberately killed compatibility with Outlook for their enterprise email service. The truth of the matter is the world runs on Windows and Microsoft deserves some credit for that Reply Garikai Dzoma says: January 6, 2017 at 11:23 AM Read again slowly this time. My uninstalling Office has nothing to do with hating Microsoft. I run bash in Windows! I and a lot of ppl cannot afford it Reply Tsenny says: January 6, 2017 at 12:01 PM PS: Volume Licensing From my experience with Volume Licensing, its is just a term most usually for organisations whereby an organisation requires multiple licenses of the Microsoft product eg the MS Office, but they do not require multiple copies of the installation media. It is cheap in the sense that you get only 1 DVD but your license can have the number of activations or seats that you require e.g for 50 users. That is how the cheapness comes about in that they do not need to ship to you 50 DVDs. What you are actually referring to as having to pay a bill every month if I am not mistaken is Office365. Reply Tsenny says: January 6, 2017 at 12:05 PM For MS Office Licenses, the licenses are perpertual and what you expires every 24 months is the Software Assurance which gives you the ability to upgrade to a new version if Microsoft brings in a new version of the software and your Software Assurance is still valid. Yes Microsoft licensing is confusing Reply Lawrence says: January 6, 2017 at 12:38 PM Thanks Tsenny and EMC. Sometimes I feel the articles on TECHZim, while aimed at addressing some tech issue, lack sufficient investigation that would make them more informative. They end up sounding like posts on a personal blog where there is no editorial moderation. And for some of us, being non-core techies, we will be hoping to read insightful articles on tech as it affects us, how we can make it easier to use, general news, etc. Like how Tsenny just described MS Office licensing in 2 short paragraphs, leaving me with sufficient detail that at least the amount I spend will be once off, but the licensing is confusing. And to the writer, from a PR point of view, “never tell a person who has taken the time to read your writing that they should “read again more slowly this time”. It’s rude. I am saying this from the point of view of both a writer, reader and consumer. Reply Garikai Dzoma says: January 6, 2017 at 1:10 PM Sigh, I apologize for being insensitive, too much time at Stack Exchange and hacker forums where you speak your mind next time I will buy a candle and we will hug it out. I am not speaking for the editor but when I write, and for most tech blogs like ZDNet, Techcrunch, Wired and a gazillion others out there, each writer has his/her little nook and cranny. We know for example that Ernesto from torrentfreak hates the DCMA, Joey from OMGUbuntu loves his cat etc it’s just how it is. I cannot, and will never write about something that I don’t know. I will never even pretend to be unbiased, that is a Western media fiction just compare Fox News and ABC for example and you will know there is never such a thing as a balanced opinion. The point of the article was Ms Office licensing is expensive and stupid compared to how they used to do it. The caustic remark was meant to point out the fact that I was talking about Word Processing and the comment is telling me to use Notepad ! and Notepad++. For the record I use Sublime Text and Atom whenever I need a text editor. Now I will admit I have done it myself countless times: I see the title and scroll down to the comment section to leave a comment without even reading the article. Reply surur says: January 6, 2017 at 7:16 PM The licensing is only confusing because Garikai was looking for a work around to paying full price. For consumers there are really only two options – 1) pay full price for the boxed copy or 2) pay for Office 365 Home. All the other licensing models are for schools and businesses or PC builders, and are not intended for regular consumers. This is the same ridiculous complaint we see about there being 11 versions of Windows . Windows Server is not for granny at home. She either gets Windows with her PC, buys a boxed copy in the store (where there will only be Pro and Home) or purchase an upgrade from the online store, where there will only be Pro and Home. Reply TheKing says: January 6, 2017 at 12:50 PM WPS is the best Microsoft Office alternative for Linux. WPS Writer matches or is actually better than Word. Reply Garikai Dzoma says: January 6, 2017 at 1:12 PM No argument here. It’s just I cannot afford it anymore. Reply Lennon says: January 6, 2017 at 1:12 PM I am selling Microsoft Office 2016 Pro Plus activation key only for $35. Reply Macd Chip says: January 6, 2017 at 2:26 PM I have read this and as someone who buys MS Office (Full Pro) almost every month, l can say this is not clearly explained, its a mixed bag of ideas. We need to clearly distinguish which office we are talking about! Is it online office or offline office. Its a rule, if you are using SaaS, the features are limited compared to offline. One such SaaS is MS Office 365. Licensing can be cheap because you can rent it when you need it, and stop when you do not want it. I have both Libre Office and MS Pro on my PC, l still believe Libre is the easier no brainer replacement for MS offline installations. Reply Lawrence says: January 6, 2017 at 3:38 PM Exactly my point.. the original article is going everywhere else except somewhere specific. Have found more insight from the comments section than the original article. That being said, being a technocrat in an area and supping with the Techcrunch, Google or any of those big guys does not make one a good article writer. One should invest time in learning how to write effectively. Reply NdiniNdadaro says: January 6, 2017 at 2:55 PM I use cracked version much like Rhodes took the land without paying. Reply Macd Chip says: January 6, 2017 at 3:30 PM cracked version on works for offline usage, the day it will call home is the day you will kiss it goodbye Reply Tom says: January 7, 2017 at 2:29 AM TechZim, your articles are becoming poorer and poorer by the day. Everytime i read ur articles since u decided to diversify from being a tech only site i am disappointed. Guys u r putting too much off ur emotions and little research in the topic at hand. Your articles are now more of click bait than informative. What have i learned from your article? i hv learned that u dont like that Microsoft dorminates the word editor space. while its ur opinion u didnt fully research on how to get a licence to use Office and which type of user each license suits , u just complained how u dont want to pay money to use Office. this article is good for a teenage blog not a site which aims to inform people. In a nutshell, too much self opinion less facts (this has bn happening for some time ) Reply peterc says: January 7, 2017 at 9:37 AM LibreOffice user here. Not the best thing since sliced bread but it solves most of my problems. Reply Joe says: January 8, 2017 at 10:17 AM I’ve been using Google docs extensively over the last few years. But here is one simple example of many as to why you should not get rid of word and rely solely on Google docs. Write a simple 5 page document in Google docs. Now go to page 3 of the document and start page numbering on that page instead. You won’t be able to. Google states it. There are several simple things like that are missing in docs that is infuriating. I always end up going back to word.

STARTUP To Land a Job, Students Need Handshake and a Smile College students looking to start their careers have a powerful new tool thanks to recruitment platform startup Handshake. By Alex Moazed Alex Moazed is the CEO of Applico, which he founded with credit cards in college. He advises companies like Google and those in Highland Capital's portfolio on platform innovation and has developed more than 300 apps. @AlexMoazed Founder and CEO, Applico@AlexMoazed WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Most college graduates remember the struggle of finding a job, much less in a relevant field. Countless people have ended up victims of that eternal scourge, the barista problem, trapped in dead-end jobs and unable to properly land in the right job. Eight years ago, this could easily have been blamed on the economy. However, conditions have turned around, but college students still struggle to find the right start to their career. A central problem, according to Handshake CEO Garrett Lord, is the geography. "Too many students go to great schools, but they simply lack the ease of access to potential employers," said Lord. Based in San Francisco, Handshake is a platform business that focuses on matching over 3 million students with companies looking to hire top talent from across the country and is fresh off a $20 million Series B from November 2016. The challenge Lord is trying to solve is connecting students to careers and companies that aren't contiguous to their universities' locations. While attending Michigan Tech, Lord was surrounded by opportunities from the automotive industry, but he was more interested in the world of Silicon Valley startups. He obtained a position with Palantir and found himself almost exclusively surrounded by students from Ivy and near-Ivy schools like Princeton and Stanford, most of whom had previously worked at companies like Google or Apple. "Stanford puts you close to startups in Silicon Valley, Princeton gets you close to finance, schools like Michigan State and Michigan Tech get you close to the big automakers," said Lord. "We want to connect students with all opportunities and streamline the whole process for everyone." Recruiters are increasingly aiming to diversify their company's staff and higher education is under extreme pressure to deliver greater returns on investment, while students are always looking for chances to begin and advance their career. Finding An Opportunity While at Palantir, Lord noticed that many companies lost sight of how difficult finding a job can be as a college student, especially when geography and economics are in the way. When tasked with recruiting some new blood, he returned to Michigan Tech to pitch his friends. At that moment, he had the idea that spawned Handshake. Lord and his friends sneaked into career fairs at schools all over the Midwest to do some scouting. The burgeoning Handshake team weren't looking for jobs, however; they were conducting market research, asking students and employers about the career search process, identifying what was simple and what was painful. They largely received universal feedback. Employers were completely dependent on info sessions, career fairs, and the centers themselves, while students found the entire process difficult, confusing, and opaque. From there, Lord and his team worked around the clock, on evenings, weekends, and even skipping class at times to build the prototype. To kickstart the business, Lord borrowed some of his dad's retirement money and put 36,000 miles on a Ford Focus while driving to career fairs and centers all across the country. The Handshake team worked to improve and validate their concept, showing mockups to career center staff from all over the country, sleeping the car, and showering in college gymnasiums when necessary. To attract universities to the platform, Handshake offered the first handful to sign up a massive discount, but it started normalizing pricing once the network experienced sufficient growth. Since its inception in 2013, Handshake has grown a network of over 3 million undergraduate students, 165,000 recruiters, and more than 100,000 companies, which includes 95% of the Fortune 500. The path to reaching their present success hinged on a single tactic that significantly differentiated Handshake from its competition and propelled them ahead: it pursued genuine partnerships with the universities and their career service centers. These partnerships have been crucial to Handshake's success in two ways. Modernizing and Streamlining First, they solve a huge functional problem that's been rampant in the collegiate recruitment world. Prior to Handshake, there hasn't been any new approach to software handling career services. Thus far, colleges are all carrying out roughly the same process, but have largely been using a hodgepodge of white-label technology leftover from the '90s. This not only causes frustration when trying to upgrade or adapt the software, but this also creates a tremendous pain point for employers. Before Handshake, recruiters were forced to maintain spreadsheets with countless sets of credentials, one for each college or university's career center web portal. Thanks to Handshake, recruiters have a single sign-on experience and career centers have an easier time managing their digital offerings. For employers, this makes tracking events like career fairs a far simpler endeavor and enables them to recruit at more schools. As well, employers have an easier time engaging with students, which boosts the activity at their booths, solving another age-old problem for recruitment. These improvements for employers have produced a marked increase for engagement, claims Lord. Particularly, HBCUs are seeing significant increases: the Atlanta University Center Consortium, comprised of Spelman College, Morehouse College, and Clark Atlanta University, hosted its largest career fair ever after adopting Handshake. Additionally, the platform lowers the barriers to entry for smaller businesses, which further increases the diversity of career offerings for students. The technical improvements for career centers is tremendous as well. Not only is the core software maintained by Handshake, but it uses a more modern approach. Prior to the development of the original software, these offices would use a system of binders, manila folders, fax machines, and other now-antiquated relics of the past. When career centers started going digital, the software they originally adopted merely mimicked the existing system, rather than replacing it with something better. Lord and his team saw this as a chance to provide a streamlined and universal upgrade to what was a rather arcane methodology. Building the Network Right In targeting the career centers, Handshake found a supremely sticky point in the process. Universities will always be in the market as employers and students change from year to year. Instead of chasing a new pool of supply and demand every few years, Handshake opted to build its market as a three-sided one. The universities can make Handshake accounts mandatory and integral to the students' experience, much as they are forced to set up a college email account. When students turn to their institutions for career services, Handshake is now there to facilitate the interactions. Competitors like WayUp tend to leave out the universities and only target employers and students. However, this method tends to have severely high churn as students and employers come and go organically; their marketplace isn't very sticky. Instead, Handshake's primary customer is consistent and holds significant influence over the other segments of the customer base. For acquiring students, it's a matter of policymaking; for acquiring employers, it's about providing access to a large pool of promising talent. Throughout its entire existence thus far, Handshake has not sent one marketing email to companies nor has it ever needed to market to students. Too often, career centers are under-resourced to serve the needs of their student bodies and keep up with the hundreds or thousands of interested companies. Handshake's value proposition to universities allows them to remain in the middle of the student-employer relationship. Handshake offers universities analytics at scale on these relationships, which was previously impossible on the archaic SaaS systems, and this empowers them to demonstrate their ROI to students. This storytelling quantifies the student-employer interactions, which offers greater transparency and helps with landing well in the rankings. An Upward Trajectory At present, there are over 170 universities in Handshake's network and the company plans to increase that number to over 200 in the next year, capturing more than half of the collegiate market in the US. That's how Lord plans to initially employ the recent raise. He views increasing the partnerships with universities as the key to making Handshake the leader in college recruitment and keeping its unparalleled pace of growth. These days, employers are calling career centers, asking them to switch to Handshake, which speaks volumes of the high-quality network effects the recruitment startup is leveraging. For now, the company will remain focused on serving students and looking to expand within that cohort. Typically, freshmen and sophomores have very low engagement with the platform, which Lord wants to resolve and, subsequently, grow the company's lifetime value. Ultimately, Lord wants Handshake to be college students' first platform for their professional development, even seeking to replace LinkedIn with what he views as a more effective, helpful experience.

Google is rolling out a real world application for its most ambitious virtual reality effort: letting shoppers see what they might buy without leaving home. The Alphabet unit on Wednesday introduced two new retail partnerships, with BMW and Gap, deploying its 3Dscanning project called Tango. The technology uses cameras and sensors in mobile devices to overlay digital images in physical space – akin to the hit mobile game Pokemon Go. The retail deals announced at the consumer technology show CES in Las Vegas hint at Google’s broader ambition to merge its mapping capabilities with its core business of facilitating commerce. With Google, BMW is testing a new app that displays an i3 city vehicle and i8 sports car on smartphone screens. Car shoppers can walk around the superimposed vehicles, placing it to look life-size inside their driveway or garage. Users can choose from six different colors, four types of trims and wheels, all appearing in a high-resolution image. The Munich-based luxury automaker said the mobile app will be available at dealerships in 11 countries. “It’s possible we’ll develop a kind of library of models for this app,” said Stefan Biermann, head of innovations for sales for BMW. At a recent presentation in Munich, the display image of an i3, even on a small phone screen, was convincing enough for users to duck and lift their legs to step inside the vehicle, where they could push a button to turn on the lights and the radio. “We see a lot of use of this technology in retail, for measuring your garage or buying big-ticket items like kitchens for example,” Eric Johnsen, who heads business development for augmented reality at Google, said at the event. Google also plans to use the indoor mapping capability of Tango to generate advertising revenue. Johnsen said Google isn’t getting revenue from sales with its newly announced partnerships, but declined to comment further on business plans. On top of the BMW app, Google announced two more developments for Tango – a new app that allows shoppers to test clothes from the Gap, and that Asus’s Zenfone AR smartphone will be compatible with the technology. However, both announcements reveal the limitations of Google’s efforts. And it's still incomplete for consumers that try the technology. With the mobile app for Gap, for instance, shoppers try on outfits using a 3D digital avatar, rather than superimpose the clothes on their bodies. The latter tactic might arrive eventually, but the tech needed is still in its infancy. Google is aware of the problem. In addition to challenges with realistic rendering, mobile 3D mapping is constrained by difficulties imposed by lighting and geographic space, said Johnny Lee, director of engineering for Tango. The gap between expectations of the technology and its reality can do more harm than good. That’s also the rationale behind Google’s cautious implementation of Tango on devices, Lee explained. While the company ultimately plans for the tech to function inside every mobile device, it now doesn’t reach a vast majority of Android smartphones.

Simon Erickson and Dylan Lewis (TMFInnovator) Jan 6, 2017 at 7:48AM On our last 2016 episode of Industry Focus: Tech, Motley Fool analysts Dylan Lewis and Simon Erickson preview what investors can expect in the tech space in 2017. Find out why they think wearable technology will enjoy some new growth avenues, what will probably happen with smart home devices, why M&A might die down from its peak in 2015. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Dec. 23, 2016. Dylan Lewis: Welcome to Industry Focus, the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. It's Friday, December 23rd, and we're looking forward to what 2017 has in store for tech. I'm your host, Dylan Lewis, and I'm joined in studio by Motley Fool premium analyst Simon Erickson. Simon, how's it going? Simon Erickson: Great, Dylan. Thanks very much for having me. Lewis: What are your holiday plans? Erickson: Heading back down to my home state of Texas, where it will be much warmer than up here in Alexandria. Lewis: I'm doing the opposite. I'm going further north where it will be colder, in New Jersey. Erickson: I wish you the best of luck. Lewis: It's going to be a little rough. This is our last show for 2016. Next week, we're actually going to be reairing some of our favorite episodes from the past year, to fill the gap between Christmas and the New Year's holiday. Simon, I was tempted to do the show where we surprised John Rotonti with your posed listener question, ultimately wound up going with something I shot with David Kretzmann about stock-based compensation. It seemed a little bit more relevant. But that was a good time. We should do that again. Erickson: I'm pretty sure my accent completely gave me away. It was really a terrible accent I tried for John, and I think he was on to me. Lewis: Because he couldn't see you, he could only hear this wild, hackneyed accent asking him a question about why it's wrong, about value investing, I think? Erickson: I think so. Lewis: But, yeah, since this is our last new show of the year, I thought maybe we would look forward to 2017, give listeners an idea of some of the things that we're watching in tech for this upcoming year. I know one thing that you're really hot on is wearable technology, and it possibly morphing beyond the traditional consumer electronics market, right? Erickson: I think that my first prediction is that wearable devices are going to look much more like medical devices in the coming year or two. We've gotten accustomed to Fitbits tracking our steps, maybe telling us a little bit about how we sleep, and a lot of fitness tracking that is kind of interesting and useful. But they're expanding how these can be used beyond just fitness. I think we're going to start seeing that more, because the real money for this is going to be coming from insurers. Insurers are going to want to see more functionality than just how many steps you're taking or what they're doing today.  And we're starting to see some of that already. We've seen now Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) work with Medtronic for type 2 diabetes to monitor blood sugar and things like this. I think that's going to be my first prediction -- you're going to start seeing a lot more of that where it's more specific applications, but it's going to be tied to insurance reimbursements. Lewis: Because really, for the insurers, more data is better. They want as much as they can to help build out some of the actuarial tables and some of the pricing for a lot of the plans they're going to be offering. In terms of better understanding patient outcomes and best treatments, there's a lot of applications there as well. Erickson: We just went to the ConnectedHealth conference here in D.C. just a couple of weeks ago and found out that about 40% of your health is based on behavior, which is very interesting, what are you eating, how active are you, what are you doing out there? And I think that plays into the wearable technology trend. You just have to get to where the money is in this industry. I think that really is from the insurers. Lewis: I think very often, people can be blind to things that are automated and rote for them because they're just humming in the background. It's a decision that they don't even realize they're making. You have some of these wearables that can help identify that in a big data step back type of way, and that can be very compelling for the insurance and healthcare market. Erickson: Absolutely. Lewis: Another area I know you're watching is how some big tech titans will be focusing on the cloud, and it sounds like the smart home market as well. Erickson: We have Alexa in our home right now -- Lewis: And actually, our podcasts have an integration with Alexa. Erickson: You can actually ask them to play our podcasts, right? Lewis: Yeah, if you feel like doing that some time. Erickson: Getting smarter, right? The Amazon Echo, which is what we refer to as Alexa here, is already a hardware device that was launched in 2015, collecting data for Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to facilitate more e-commerce transactions. Now, this last year, we saw Google Home introduce their own hardware competing product, so they can get more information on what you're searching for and what you're wanting to do, which, of course, can drive advertising. We've seen that Jeff Bezos has said he has 1,000 employees working on Amazon Echo right now. Lewis: That's insane. Erickson: It's really crazy to think about. They've sold 5 million of these already earlier this year. So, this is a really big project for a really big company, and an innovative visionary leader that's not afraid to put money behind some of his best ideas. I really think that not only Amazon but also Google, also Microsoft, also Facebook, are wanting to collect more and more data that you're giving it in your living room, so that they can supplement and improve their businesses. Lewis: And it seems like a lot of these hardware solutions are really reducing the friction that users have with getting whatever it is that they're searching for, whether it be a podcast, like one of The Motley Fool podcasts, or maybe it's an answer on what the weather is like, or something like that. But, a lot of time, it's ease of use. You look at something like Google's original search algorithm and how that brought the entire tech landscape and navigating the web into something that is simple and easy to find. A lot of what these smart home and more integrated solutions we're seeing from big tech names are doing is something similar, is a next layer on top of that, as I'm seeing at least. Erickson: Yeah, I completely agree with you. We've seen them launch the product first and then optimize it over time second, basically strategy model of these. Amazon wanted to get the Echo out, get it in your home. And it's not going to be able to do everything up front. In fact, it was very limited when they first launched it, but it's getting smarter. It's able to do more and more things. And I think in the future, we're going to see that more and more being based on transactions, rather than just playing music or asking what the temperature is, "Book me an Uber" or "Reorder me something on Amazon." I think that's the next wave that Amazon is going forward, and Google is going after a lot of data as well. Lewis: One of the things I thought was really interesting. I was talking with Fool.com writer Daniel Kline about this. He's a gadget head, loves everything, owns everything. He'll buy it so he can write an article about it -- he's that kind of guy. He said Amazon was very smart with what they've done with Echo, because they have started out with very limited functionality, and they nailed the execution on that functionality. Rather than maybe what we've seen with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)and Siri and some of those other assistant-style things, where the execution was wonky because it tried to do too much. So, it'll be interesting to see how these different tech companies, from a functionality perspective, and all the features they allow here, continue to develop that, because it seems like Amazon has been smart there in slowly rolling it out and building a ton of confidence in the capabilities of the device and the underlying software and then adding things as they're able to execute for users.  Erickson: Yeah, and it's a race right now. Do you really need to have Alexa and Google Home and everything else in your home? You probably don't. Maybe you could have them talk to each other and have an interesting conversation. But really, this is almost a winner-takes-all for your living room, which I think is very beneficial for whoever sells the most hardware devices. They're really going to win the data prize at the end. Lewis: Switching gears here, I know one thing that we're both very interested in is tech mergers and acquisitions, and what that might look like in 2017. There are a couple different factors that I think might play into this. Some numbers from Dealogic: According to their estimates, global technology targeted M&A in 2014 was around $300 billion. In 2015, it was nearly $700 billion. Year to date in 2016, it's around $530 billion. For context, 2006 to 2013, total M&A wasn't above $300 billion once. My projection here is that we will see tech M&A be more or less flat from 2016, maybe even go down. I don't think we're going to revisit that huge peak we had in 2015. A couple different factors here on my end. Do you have any thoughts on that? Erickson: Money's cheap. Lewis: Money's cheap. Erickson: What's the interest rate looked like the last several years, you know? Lewis: Exactly. Last week, the Fed announced it was raising rates for the second time in 10 years. Now, the federal funds rate, which is the baseline rate for overnight bank borrowing, is at 75 basis points (0.75%), which is up from 50 basis points. Fed officials indicated that they would be possibly interested in making up to three increases next year, which would obviously be more aggressive than they'd originally forecast. The market wasn't quite expecting that. Also, they project three hikes in 2018 and 2019. All of this is to say, it will probably get more expensive to borrow. Capital is not going to be as cheap as it has been in the past. I think that will make some of these acquisitions a little tougher, because very often they're financed by debt by some of these big companies. Erickson: It's an interesting dynamic. I would say, right now if you go back to the early 2000s, it was all about getting a website. First, we had pets.com and every other dot-com that you could possibly get out there because the internet was blossoming. Then, you look maybe seven or eight years after that, and it was all about mobile, and everybody wanted to be an app that was on your smartphone that you could access, and that was just completely the new business model. I think now we're actually kind of slowing down on producing new things, because we have kind of overwhelmed what consumers can reliably handle, as far as websites and apps. I think it's going to be much more about, how are they useful, and who's consolidating that data? I think that's the third phase of the internet we're about to start experiencing. Lewis: I think one of the other things that might play into what we see with M&A moving forward is, a lot of people look at the market right now and they see that it's fairly expensive, in historical terms. You look at the S&P 500's trailing P/E, it's in the mid to upper mid-20s. That's on the higher end when you look back over the past 90 years. Historically, it's high single digits to low 20s, with some outliers here and there. Obviously, these are all broad-stroke macro factors, and none of this scares me away from buying any individual companies. But it's good to be aware of the general atmosphere surrounding the market. I don't think you will continue to see the consolidation that you've seen, particularly in spaces like the semiconductor industry and things like that, simply because it's going to be more expensive to borrow, and valuations have already been pushed up because it's been so inexpensive to borrow for such a long time. There is a wrench, possibly, that could get thrown into this thought process. Erickson: Here we go. Lewis: You want to deliver it? This is your theory. The potential for a tax holiday could be a little bit disruptive with this line of thinking, right? Erickson: That's the wrench that gets thrown into the plan. The gloves are off, what's going to happen, if all of the sudden you can repatriate these billions of dollars that tech companies have had overseas into the U.S. for a reduced rate? That could change the entire dynamic, probably. Lewis: You wouldn't need the debt to be able to finance these types of acquisitions. Not that it would be a problem for a company like Apple or Microsoft to do that. But these are two companies that I believe 90% of their cash hoard is held overseas. For them to bring that back under current tax law, they would be taking a huge haircut to do it. So, they've been harvesting that money overseas, and basically just letting it sit in marketable securities. But, if they are granted a one-time special tax holiday by president elect Trump, obviously that would make it a lot easier for more deals to go through. Erickson: Would that make America great again? Lewis: It might. I don't know. It's hard for me to know. I am no politico. I am just a guy they decided to give a weekly podcast to. Erickson: Well, I'm glad that you started the reckless predictions for this. I do think the interesting part is, obviously, Trump has campaigned a lot about establishing jobs in America. Of course, tech is a huge source of jobs in this country. So, a tax holiday could theoretically provide a lot of that for him. Lewis: Yeah. And, I mean, to show his emphasis on the tech industry, they had that tech summit, was that last week? A lot of execs were there. I know Tim Cook was there. So, he's clearly appealing to that group of executives and that industry. It will be interesting to see what the follow-through is there. Obviously, like we said, it's something that could disrupt that process, and that line of thinking with M&A trajectories. But, something we won't know for sure, and just have to watch. Erickson: Indeed. Lewis: Any other things to watch for 2017? Anything on your dashboard? Erickson: Well, I have two reckless predictions for M&A. Lewis: Love it!  Erickson: This is the crystal that is always cloudy. We never know where it's actually going to hit or not. But just for the show, for you, Dylan, I came up with to reckless predictions of M&A acquisition that I could see happening in the future. Lewis: I appreciate that. And emphasis on reckless. Erickson: Yes. And any hate mail from our listeners, directly to your inbox, right? Lewis: Yes. That's dlewis@fool.com. Or industryfocus@fool.com, if you feel like hitting all of us! Erickson: These are, again, highly speculative. I don't recommend anybody go out and buy these based on this. But two things that I do see that are very interesting out there: My first reckless prediction in the tech M&A space is IBM (NYSE:IBM) acquiring Splunk. The reason being, IBM has been a company that has shown it's willing to change its business model so many times. It's reinvented itself so many times over the decades, successfully. And it recognizes in the healthcare space, in all of the spaces that Watson is playing in right now, it has to look at unstructured data. It has to look at the fuller context of what's going on in the data that we're trying to figure out X outcome to come out of. The leader right now, far and away, in unstructured data, is Splunk. IBM is trying to use Watson to improve the outcomes of the healthcare space. So, I would make that reckless prediction No. 1 in the M&A space. Lewis: All right, what's reckless prediction No. 2? Erickson: No. 2 is Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) buys Veeva Systems. Again, you have a non-compete clause here with Veeva having exclusive rights to the life sciences and healthcare industry, whereas Salesforce is focused on almost everything else for software as a service, improving sales efficiencies, and actually, Veeva's CEO came from Salesforce.com, has a great relationship with those guys, and is actually using Salesforce to power along the back-end architecture for that company. I think they've carved out a very profitable niche, and they've kept that great relationship with Salesforce. I think that's a natural fit, potentially, for the future. Lewis: I love that those were your two, because two that came to mind for me, these are companies we have discussed fairly recently on the Tech podcast, Twitter and Pandora. Very curious to see what happens with them in 2017, because Twitter, of course, went through that flurry of headlines about potentially being suited by, Salesforce was one of them, Marc Benioff, their CEO, seemed enamored with Twitter. But I know Disney was in the conversation at some point, I believe Microsoft was in the conversation at some point. It seemed like anyone with a decent amount of cash on hand was in the conversation. And Pandora recently in chats, potentially, with Sirius. I know there has been some speculation there, too. David Kretzmann and I did a show on them a couple weeks ago. So, I'm glad to see that you're bringing some fresh perspectives, those are truly reckless predictions, and ones that maybe a lot of people aren't thinking about right now. Erickson: Sure. Lewis: Glad to have you on. Anything else before I let you go, Simon? Erickson: I think that's it. We're obviously keeping a very close eye on the tech space in Motley Fool Explorer, and also MDP and Rule Breakers. It's an interesting time to be a tech investor. We've seen the valuations a lot higher than we've been used to. On the other side, these companies are doing some pretty innovative stuff out there. Continues to make our jobs very interesting and a lot of fun. Lewis: It's a lot of fun to talk about. I'm sure I'll have you on the show plenty of times in 2017. Erickson: Thanks for having me today, Dylan.  Lewis: Well, listeners, that does it for this episode of Industry Focus.

The Pixel series replaced the existing Nexus line of devices. But that might not mean that Google would give up on the strategy that it employed with the Nexus devices. From 2010 to 2015, Google launched a Nexus device every year, from the Nexus One to the Nexus 6P. According to T3, Google might follow the same launch strategy. The Pixel 2 and Pixel XL2 are expected to be launched by October 2017 and might be made by HTC, which made the 2016 Pixel devices. Here are five expected features of the Pixel 2 series smartphones: Snapdragon 835 processor The Snapdragon 835 seems to be the smartphone processor of choice for 2017. The processor is expected to be powering flagship devices this year including the Note 8 and S8 devices. The processor is built using 10nm processor technology, which provides better performance and battery life than existing processors. QHD resolution display for the Pixel 2 Google might upgrade the Pixel smartphone display from 1080 x 1920p to 1440 x 2560p, making the display at par with the Pixel XL. Dual cameras One of issues with the 2016 Pixel device was the camera lens flare. The 2017 device might have a dual camera setup, following in the footsteps of Apple and Samsung.

The Daydream View headset is expected to have advanced VR capabilities with a special focus on VR gaming, and it will need a powerful device to support it. 6GB RAM Google is expected to increase the RAM in the Pixel series devices from 4GB to 6GB to support added functionalities, more powerful specs and most importantly the next iteration of the Android OS.

That is a lot. It is not surprising, we only just reported on the number of Android vulnerabilities being large, but it isn't great news. At least Google appears to be on top of the issues. LG, a third party that offers handsets running Android, has reacted to the patches already. It says that they cover a mix of vulnerabilities and that at least one is very critical. Left unchecked it would allow for remote code execution, and no one wants that kind of threat live in their pocket. "The January Security Bulletin contains the patches for the vulnerabilities from Google and LG. The most severe of these vulnerabilities is a Critical security vulnerability that could enable remote code execution on an affected device through multiple methods such as email, web browsing, and MMS when processing media files," said LG in its information. "The security patch level is [2107-01-01] and the patches contains the fix for the CVE items and the 8 LVE items." LG recommends all users update their devices to the latest version of the software. So do we. Google said that the updates have been provided over the air and that this should be applied to handsets. It added that firmware updates have been released to the developer pages, and that Pixel and Nexus users should refer to their update schedule to check when they will get a fix. It said that while the things are bad on paper, there is no evidence of a real world threat. "The most severe of these issues is a Critical security vulnerability that could enable remote code execution on an affected device through multiple methods such as email, web browsing, and MMS when processing media files," explained the firm. "We have had no reports of active customer exploitation or abuse of these newly reported issues. Refer to the Android and Google service mitigations section for details on the Android security platform protections and service protections such as SafetyNet, which improve the security of the Android platform. We encourage all customers to accept these updates to their devices." µ Tweet   Facebook   Google plus       Send to   Topics Security cloud computing Android INQ Latest Robot rights: EU votes to grant "electronic personhood" to Cyberdyne T-800s Robot beatings to be outlawed in EU Hardware 13 January 2017 Nintendo Switch for £280?

In this episode of Marketing Nerds, SEJ Executive Editor Kelsey Jones sat down with Simon Schnieders and Edward Kreiman from Blue Array to talk about what the upcoming Mobile Interstitial Penalty from Google is. In an announcement made last August 2016, Google will start devaluing pages with intrusive pop-ups (also known as interstitials). The change will take effect on January 10, 2017. Kelsey, Simon, and Ed also discuss how to check to see if your site has been affected, how a mobile-first world has affected UX, and what Google is looking for in a positive searcher experience. Can you give an overview of what the upcoming mobile interstitial penalty is? Simon: Sure. What we know about the interstitial penalty so far is that, first and foremost, it’s a mobile interstitial penalty. Then secondarily, it’s an intrusive interstitial penalty. There’s a size of interstitial that we’re aware Google frowns upon. We’re guessing it’s somewhere around 15% of the screen size. Anything beyond that would be into territory that could be penalized. We also know that Google won’t be releasing an interstitial penalty checking tool. The last we’ve heard is that they won’t be releasing anything. What counts as an interstitial and what is Google counting as an intrusive interstitial? Simon: Google’s being quite loose on exactly what they mean by an intrusive interstitial. They do have some examples on a blog post they did back in August 2016. It gives some examples of interstitials they say make content less accessible, i.e. they’re intrusive. They also give some examples of interstitials they wouldn’t have any problem with. If it’s an interstitial that’s there for legal obligation such as age verification, cookie usage, or log in dialogues on sites where the content isn’t publicly indexable, meaning that it’s not as if you’re cloaking that content to Google, then they would be fine with those kinds of interstitials. Then they talk about banners taking up a reasonable amount of screen space. Again, ‘reasonable’ is up for debate. We would guess something around 15%. The tool that Ed’s been building around this is able to determine how many pixels that particular banner or interstitial would be taking up on the screen. We’re flagging around 15, or over 15%, as being a potential problem. Kelsey: That makes sense. I think when it comes down to it, Google is trying to make sure that any pop-ups you have, any ads, they’re not interfering with the user experience. That’s what they’re trying to avoid on a mobile screen. How has the rise of mobile usage affected the way you do SEO or the way you set up user experience on websites? Simon: Moving forward we’re going with mobile first. It’s a difficult habit for old guys like me who’ve been doing this for a long time. You need to think of accessing a website on a mobile device first and foremost. It’s not an easy trick for old dogs. Not just for mobile but also on desktop, we’re sort of thinking more about voice search now. Obviously, Google is gearing towards that with featured snippets, i.e. having very short, what could be audible answers to very common questions. We’re sort of thinking ahead towards voice search now but still obviously dealing with the very real now. The now is that it’s a mobile web. We still have some sites where they’ve got m. sub-domains with skinny content compared to the full-fat content on desktop. We were able to audit all of our client sites by going through with a crawl on 50,000 URLs by our mobile user agent versus 50,000 crawls with a desktop user agent and basically do a diff check. If we were seeing differences between the two, we were highlighting that to clients as something they needed to work on. I guess in terms of actionable steps that we took; that was one of the things we were doing. Kelsey: Yeah, that’s great. I think before, mobile versions of websites were an afterthought. Now, to hear developers and design agencies moving into, “We need to think of mobile first and desktop second,” that’s a huge shift in how we do design and user experience and SEO as a whole. How do you think AMP is factoring into the actions Google is taking with the interstitial penalty? Simon: Accelerated Mobile Pages I think is interesting. It’s something Google is certainly pushing hard on. You know that they’re changing the messaging that appears within AMP snippets from a lightning icon to something fairly obvious. As in this page will load a lot faster for you, something along those lines, to try to get users to understand what it is. If it’s user-led then obviously the publishers will follow. At the moment it’s something that has a fairly high opportunity cost. I find it a difficult thing to justify. One, because it’s a stripped down version of HTML, essentially. You got limited functionality with that. It’s fairly disempowering for publishers to take AMP on board. I guess the upside is you get some free organic visibility or increased organic visibility with AMP. At some stage maybe users will start to catch on that this is something that’s going to be faster for them but I don’t think it’s there yet. Is it worth that opportunity cost is the question right now. I’m not sure it is. Could it be something that Google will decide in a few months from now that they’re not seeing much user interaction with and will start to scale back that increased organic visibility? Possibly. We saw that with app indexing or deep-linking as well. They were giving free organic visibility to sites that had those deep links in place and that’s been stripped back. Could it be the same with that? Possibly. It was born because of ad blockers, right? It was Google’s answer to ad blocking. You’ve got to recognize that users are turned off by site speed and therefore, here’s our answer to site speed. It got rolled out very, very quickly. I just don’t think that it’s right for everyone. Can you talk more about your interstitial penalty checking tool, how it came about, and how it can be useful? Ed: Absolutely. Google published the upcoming penalty and we saw there is a need and opportunity for us to act upon. We developed a tool that’s using image recognition to identify potential interstitials on the page. Since we’re using image recognition, we can measure how much space it takes on the screen and therefore flag whether it’s a risk or not. The future thinking is we potentially might apply some machine learning to run on top of the images we’re capturing from the websites to automate and speed up the process of scanning and crawling. Simon: That’s interstitialpenaltycheck.com. Fairly memorable. Let’s say somebody uses your tool and they get flagged as, “Your interstitials could be taking up more than 15% of your site.” What are some ways they can change it and other ways to still get conversions without using those intrusive pop-ups or other aspects? Simon: I think if site owners have seen significant drop-offs in conversion by removing the interstitial, there is a work-around. If the user navigates to another page on the website, popping up an interstitial at that stage wouldn’t be a problem for Google. It’s the entry page that would be the issue for Google. Presuming the user has then decided that, “Actually, this is a great website and I’m going to explore a little bit more detail,” you can still shoehorn those interstitials in there if you’re absolutely resigned to that being the best way to convert users.

NB: This is a viewpoint by Max Starkov, president & CEO, and Mariana Safer, senior vice president of marketing, at HeBS Digital. In 2017, lowering distribution costs (the only cost driver hotels have control over), will be the only way to improve top line revenue and the bottom line. In most of the major markets, increasing ADRs, improving occupancy and RevPAR will not be easy. But with the right focus and appropriate investments in digital technology and marketing initiatives, hoteliers can generate more direct bookings and decrease their dependency on the OTAs. Here’s the first five digital, technology and marketing resolutions all hotels should consider this year. 1 “Knowing that 2017 will be the year of smart data marketing, I will balance the use of CRM data with intent data (in-market) to engage, retain and acquire both past and future guests.” Situation Every hotelier has access to more data than they realise, and they can use this data to build a digital marketing plan that reaches the right people, at the right time, on the right device, to win the booking. This data is either in the form of CRM data – data about past guests – or intent data – data that tells us what people are planning a trip to a specific destination, and when. On any given night, with an average of 15-25% of guests at a typical independent hotel being repeat guests, using CRM data is only part of the equation. Focusing on reaching guests who have not stayed at your property before but are actively planning a trip to your property’s destination will result­ in a much higher percentage of direct bookings. Balancing the use of both sets of data – CRM data and intent data – in your digital marketing initiatives to engage past and future guests is called ‘smart data marketing.’ Watch this video, which brings smart data marketing to life: Action plan: Start by using CRM data, website analytics and marketing insights to create the targeting and customer segment objectives of your multichannel campaigns and marketing strategy. Through this data you can extrapolate and build customer personas, which will allow you to understand your target segments’ motivations, online behaviours and passion points. Your “best guest” shouldn’t just be defined by past guest demographics, but by travel consumers who are in-market and willing to consider and book your property today. Intent data enables marketing campaigns to target and convert travellers who are in-market and have exhibited purchase intent. Next, utilise in-market targeting throughout your marketing initiatives, including SEM, the Google Display Network, YouTube TrueView campaigns, travel ad networks that have access to first-party travel planning data, and programmatic advertising. When possible integrate dynamic rate marketing to display the best available rates in your marketing messages for the travel consumer’s exact dates of stay, which will increase conversions and bookings. Lastly, learn from your campaign results and continuously optimize your marketing messages, targeting, etc. CRM data and intent data are integral pieces of any hotelier’s marketing strategy. If your strategy isn’t utilising real-time “in-market” targeting that reaches potential guests – travellers who have expressed intent to travel now or in the near future to your destination, you are missing the opportunity to expand and “replenish” your existing customer base on an ongoing basis. Read more in our article, “Smart Data Marketing in Hospitality: The Secret to Maximizing Direct Bookings.” 2. “This year I will put implementing a “Direct is Always Better” strategy and lowering distribution costs at the forefront of my digital technology and marketing plan.” Situation: With supply predicted to exceed demand in many global markets in 2017, ‘book direct’ strategies are more important than ever. With flat or even negative occupancy growth, the only way to increase revenues is to shift from more expensive distribution channels, such as the OTAs, to cheaper distribution channels such as direct bookings. The average direct distribution cost on a hotel website booking is 4%-4.5%, including ongoing website technology upgrades and content optimization, dynamic content personalisation, reservation abandonment programs, hosting, SEO, paid search, online media and retargeting, first-party and real-time data marketing, email marketing, social media engagements, consulting, etc. Compare this to the hefty OTA commissions of 18%-25% for independent hotels, smaller and midsize hotel brands. Except for distribution costs, hoteliers have very little leverage over the main cost drivers in hotel operations: labor costs, debt services, franchise fees, utilities and real estate taxes. Distribution costs, however, have been rising steadily over the last 5 years due to OTAs increasing market share by over 40% vs hotel direct bookings. Action plan: Many hoteliers, due to inertia or lack of understanding how the complex world of online distribution and marketing works, lack the strategy and drive to really focus efforts and resources on generating direct bookings. Most hotel properties do not designate clear responsibilities or an action plan on how they are going to achieve this, and they continue to operate at the status quo. Hoteliers must focus on and invest smartly in their direct booking strategy, and shift share from the OTAs to the direct channel. How should they do this? ● Adopt a top-down ‘direct is always better’ strategy: include direct booking share benchmarks and objectives, employee responsibilities, performance compensation tie-ins and bonuses, guest “book direct” value adds, and more. This strategy may necessitate a big cultural shift on property but is well worth the effort.   ● Cost of direct online channel distribution should be treated in exactly the same manner as OTA commissions i.e. as a cost of goods sold (COGS) and deducted from the gross room revenue before sales, general and administrative expenses are calculated. Recognizing direct online distribution costs as COGS will unleash the property’s ability to adequately fund the direct online channel efforts, boost bookings via the property website and drastically decrease OTA dependency. Lowering overall distribution costs will allow the property to fund renovations and product/services improvements, invest in human resources, and add a hefty chunk to the bottom line. ● Invest in the right tools to increase direct website bookings. These include: Reservation abandonment applications: with the average travel consumer going through 19 different touchpoints before making a booking, it is not surprising that 98% of visitors do not book when first visiting a hotel website. Reservation abandonment emailers and lightboxes that display “come back” or “book direct” messages entice users to complete the booking. Smart personalization: delivering real-time, relevant content leads to higher conversions as consumers have pertinent information placed right in front of them while they browse your website and look to make a purchase. Smart data marketing: (see #1 above) by utilizing both “owned data” (otherwise known as CRM data, which includes past guest data, website analytical data, etc) and layering intent data, hoteliers can effectively reach in-market users during the travel planning process. ‘Instant Rewards’ programs: especially for hotel brands that do not have an established loyalty program, this type of program allows website visitors to unlock real-time exclusive rates and promotions on the hotel website. A/B testing: testing variations of different elements of the website helps improve user experience, page performance, and most importantly, drive more conversions. Hoteliers should also adopt an effective merchandising strategy to sell on value and not just on rate. Another option is to start thinking about hiring a “distribution optimization manager” –  a new on-property role which should be rewarded on the blended cost of distribution (OTA vs. direct) and incentivized to lower distribution costs YoY. Read more in “Hotel Distribution Cost: The Only Cost Driver That Can Save Your Property’s Bottom Line in 2017” 3. “I understand that investing in digital technology & marketing provides me with a concrete roadmap to jumpstart my property’s direct bookings, and I will structure my 2017 digital technology and marketing budget in a way that generates the highest returns possible.” Situation: Hoteliers in general are notorious for under-investing in digital technology and marketing and being over-dependent on the OTAs. Here at HeBS Digital we have had many cases with our hotel clients when a multi-channel campaign or a digital marketing initiative is performing exceptionally well, with ROIs of 1500% – 2500% and up (which equals to a distribution cost of 4%-6.6%), and yet the property cannot allocate more funds to the campaigns and marketing initiatives due to budget limitations (in spite of the fact that they need the business badly). It is extremely ironic that the most cost-effective bookings – from the direct online channel – are severely restricted by the property’s sales and marketing budget, while the most expensive bookings – from the OTAs with cost of distribution of 18% – 25% and higher, are not restricted and can grow exponentially. This resolution makes it into the “Top Ten Resolutions List” every year because the hotelier’s digital technology and marketing budget provides the foundation necessary for a property to succeed in driving increased revenues year-over-year. If generating direct website bookings are not prioritized or budgeted properly for, the performance of the property as a whole is at risk. Action plan: Prioritise generating direct website bookings, budget the right amount (most hoteliers should spend a minimum of 4-6% of their total room revenue on advertising/marketing efforts, of which at least 75% should be spent on digital marketing), and keep the digital marketing budget fluid and dynamic to accommodate changes in business-needs and new opportunities that become available. We recommend organizing your overall budget into these three categories: Year-round direct response marketing: this section of the budget is comprised of evergreen, high revenue-generating initiatives that increase direct room bookings such as SEM, SEO, GDN (Google Display Network), smart data marketing, including programmatic and dynamic rate marketing initiatives, email marketing, online media and retargetting, and website conversion enhancements such as Reservation Abandonment Applications and personalisation on the hotel website. Seasonal and targetted multichannel marketing campaigns: with one cohesive theme, these campaigns are focused on seasonal and occupancy needs, filling rooms around when the property needs it most, as well as special events/holidays, and reaching key customer segments such as leisure travelers, family travelers, business travelers, meeting, wedding and event planners, etc. Technology assets, strategy and operations: this part of the budget is the backbone of any hotelier’s digital technology and digital marketing strategy; without properly investing in these line items, any marketing initiative launched will not succeed. This includes website revenue optimization consulting, a responsive website, content management system technology, analytics, and cloud hosting/CDN. Here is a snapshot of the recommended 2017 digital technology and marketing budget: Read more in “The Smart Hoteliers Guide to 2017 Digital Marketing Budgets“. 4. “Mobile-first will be a common 2017 theme throughout my digital technology and marketing investments as I know travel consumers are turning to their mobile device more and more to plan their hotel stays.” Situation: With over half of travel-related searches on Google now coming from mobile devices (Google), and mobile/tablet bookings increasing 70% YoY (HeBS Digital portfolio), it makes sense to embrace the mobile-first marketing approach in everything you do, from the hotel website to your marketing strategy. According to Google Research, nine out of ten people are “cross-device” internet browsers and researchers, using multiple devices sequentially (moving from one device to another at different times). Smartphones are by far the most common starting point for sequential activity: 65% of users start their research on a smartphone and 60% continue on a desktop device. Consumers on their mobile devices are driven by immediacy, and hoteliers need to be able to address their needs in the moment. Action plan: Properly invest in a “mobile-first” strategy: On the hotel website: A responsive website that offers the optimum user experience on the desktop, mobile and tablet is a must, and fast download speeds are key to not frustrating your website visitors. As a result of last year’s algorithm update from Google, if a hotel website is not easy to use on mobile, Google will penalize the site even further by ranking it lower on its mobile search pages. It is important to carry out a website technology audit to make sure your property website’s content management system (CMS) is engineered to comply with the latest Google updates. Using industry-leading technology as the backbone of your hotel website is the best way to ensure your site stays compliant with Google’s mobile-friendliness requirements. Similarly, an SEO technology audit is vital to ensure your website complies with Google’s mobile search requirements. Hoteliers need to consider link structure, resizing of images, reconfiguring design elements and replacing Flash with crawlable, search-friendly code. And specifically looking at download speeds, especially on mobile devices, is recommended as it is another category which Google’s mobile algorithm takes into account when ranking your page. In digital marketing campaigns: When you think about the process for planning travel, it’s never a one-way street. Travel consumers might start with a Google search, watch a video, go to the hotel website, check reviews, and eventually make a booking. People are going through so many different touch points, and there is no particular order. You have to be ready to stand out when someone makes their way to your website in their journey. The foundation for building effective digital marketing campaigns is finding the best marketing initiatives based on the customer segment you are targeting, and reaching that target segment at every touch point of their online travel planning process, which often starts on the mobile device. For SEO, consider what kind of search terms people are using ‘on the go’; in your SEM ads, create mobile ad copy with ‘last-minute’ messaging and click to call; for email marketing, make sure your email marketing pieces are fully responsive and to the point; and for online media campaigns, make sure your banners are in HTML 5 and render on mobile devices. These are the minimum requirements for making your campaigns mobile-friendly. Remember to also consider what KPIs you are measuring to determine the success of your mobile campaigns. Your property will receive more phone calls from these mobile campaigns, and focusing on your usual direct conversions and website bookings on their own will not give you the big picture. 5. “I understand my travel consumers are going through a planning and purchasing journey spanning multiple devices and touchpoints, and will implement multichannel marketing campaigns to reach them across the various touch points of that journey.” Situation: On average, the travel consumer goes through 19 different touchpoints before making a booking. Each one of these touchpoints is an opportunity for hotels to build a brand connection, influence intent, and be there for every step of the way. The era of launching one-off marketing initiatives is over. Focusing on paid search, but ignoring your search engine optimization strategy, or not advertising cohesive marketing messages on the Google Display Network; or focusing on CRM data but ignoring intent data (see smart data marketing above) will not effectively reach your target audiences or produce a high return on investment. The days of partnering with several agencies or companies to run various campaigns (one vendor for SEO, another for SEM, a third for Online Media) are over. This approach is sure to cause a lack of cohesion among campaigns, sub-par results and flawed reporting. Action plan: Multichannel campaigns are one of the most effective ways to boost direct bookings, build one-to-one relationships with current and future guests, and ultimately, encourage repeat guests throughout the customer lifecycle. To build a successful multichannel campaign you must first determine your property’s business needs and key target markets to ensure your marketing messages will resonate with your audience. You then need to map the path to purchase, choosing initiatives that will reach your target audiences throughout their travel planning journey. This will most likely include SEM, smart data marketing, email marketing and more. A general rule of thumb for a successful multichannel campaign marketing mix is 30-40% investment in core revenue drivers such as SEM, GDN, email, etc, 20-30% in display and social media advertising initiatives, 10% in organic campaign content, and 20-30% in campaign creative. .Click here to read “How to Jumpstart Your Hotel’s Direct Bookings through Multichannel Campaigns.” NB: This is a viewpoint by Max Starkov, president & CEO, and Mariana Safer, senior vice president of marketing, at HeBS Digital.

Amazon’s voice assistant is clearly the darling of CES 2017. This may well be the year you switch from tapping and typing on touchscreens to simply shouting commands. Many platforms, from Apple’s Siri and Micosoft’s Cortana to Google’s Assistant and Samsung’s Viv, want to be your conversational partner, but Alexa easily leads the race. The winner will claim a sweet prize. Just how big is the subject of not a little speculation, but the best estimate pegs the market for digital assistants at $3.6 billion by 2020. These things will be everywhere. You’ll find dozens of Alexa-enabled devices at CES. Ford rolled in with a car that summons your assistant with a button on the steering wheel. Klipsch built a speaker with an Echo Dot-sized hole at the top. Whirlpool appliances respond to commands barked at your Echo. Before long you’ll change channels on your Dish Hopper DVR just by yelling at it. Even your LG fridge will work with Alexa to play music, set timers, and tell you how many tablespoons are in a cup (16). In many ways, Amazon’s success grew from its willingness to share its tech. When I tried the Lenovo Smart Assistant Speaker, a dead ringer for the Echo, I heard someone ask why Amazon would let anyone build a competing product. Mike George, the Amazon vp in charge of Alexa and Echo, finds such questions almost silly. “We’ve always approached things the same way, trying to be as open as possible,” he says. Amazon once packaged and shipped books it bought from vendors. Then it launched Amazon Marketplace, letting anyone use Amazon’s e-commerce and fulfillment tech. It now comprises half of Amazon’s business. It’s the same story with Amazon Web Services, the massive cloud computing infrastructure that generates billions in revenue hosting pretty much anything for anyone. Working with buyers and sellers has always been part of what makes Amazon successful. And so it seems almost logical that it would offer developers the tools needed to build Skills (which are basically apps) for Alexa products, or to integrate Alexa into their products. The process is so easily accomplished that George says the company constantly discovers products with Alexa baked in that no one at Amazon heard about ahead of time. Last year, countless consumers started interacting with those products, and those powered by Siri and the rest. CES offered a glimpse of a world where people interact not with a single voice-powered box in the living room, but with a platform that stretches from the bathroom to the car to the office and beyond. Digital assistants, and Alexa specifically, are everywhere. Making so vast a system work seamlessly is complicated. The key, George says, is your interaction with Alexa must be the same everywhere. But the features may vary. “I can imagine that if I have that new LG fridge, I might do more kitchen-related things there,” he says. On Amazon’s Fire TV products, for instance, Alexa can’t set timers or alarms, because why would you need it to? Some Alexa-enabled products have screens, others don’t. That raises another set of questions. “What happens when there’s no screen involved?” George says. “What about when there is a screen? Is there anything different about the heads-up display on a car?” These aren’t theoretical questions. Amazon put Echos in every room at the Wynn hotel during CES, only to discover some complications. Staying in a hotel brings specific needs—setting an alarm, for example—that the next guest won’t necessarily want. “When I check out, that should go away,” George says. Alexa’s exponential proliferation has Amazon grappling with what its digital assistant can and should do in all these new places. The pitch for a successful digital assistant has always been contingent upon it being with always and everywhere, with the data and context it needs to work. This raises significant privacy concerns, among other things, and the need to create a platform robust, and secure, enough to work everywhere. “How do you deploy computer systems that a ceiling fan company can use,” says Rishi Shandra, the product manager for Google Home. The pressure is even greater for Amazon, because its radically open Alexa policy means developers can build voice control the same way they build smartphone apps. Amazon went from 1,000 to 7,000 Echo skills in the last seven months. That will grow even faster in the next seven. This was the week Alexa conquered CES. And this is the year Alexa conquers the world. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Alexa CES Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News. Share Share Tweet Pin Comment Email Skip Latest News.

Google has been trying to position the vast network of smartphones running its Android operating system for virtual and augmented reality, known as VR and AR, fields that many in the technology industry say are poised to go mainstream after years of niche appeal. Chinese manufacturer Huawei Technologies Co [HWT.UL] announced on Thursday that two of its phones will soon work with Daydream View, a VR headset released last year by Google. Meanwhile, Taiwanese manufacturer AsusTek Computer Inc announced that its ZenFone AR will support both Daydream and Google’s Tango software for AR, in which computer-generated content is overlaid on the real world. While the announcements expand the line-up of participating phones, Google still has much to do to take its technology to the masses, said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research, noting that Samsung Electronics Co, the largest Android manufacturer, has yet to sign on. “Google’s ecosystem for both AR and VR is in the very early days,” he said. As growth in the global smartphone market shows signs of slowing, some manufacturers are voicing optimism that AR and VR will revive consumer enthusiasm. “This is the next wave of technology that is really going to get consumers excited about smartphones,” Erik Hermanson, Asus’s head of marketing for mobile products, said at the show. But mainstream consumer interest in the technology remains largely unproven. Apps might be expected to stimulate demand, but until Google’s technology is available on a wider range of phones, it will be tough to persuade developers to build for the platform, analysts said. “We are waiting for app developers to really use the platform for what it’s for,” Amit Singh, a vice president for VR at Google, told reporters. In addition to supporting Daydream, Huawei said that it is exploring opportunities for Tango with Google. The Asus phone became the first to support both technologies. Google has stressed that the programs do not overlap for now, but by pursuing both, the company can position itself for success regardless of whether AR or VR becomes a mainstream hit. “By having options for both, they can cover the full potential market,” said analyst Bob O’Donnell of TECHnalysis Research. source Tags: Google | Tango | Technology | Yahoo Newsdesk Website Previous ArticlePakistan’s regional languages face looming extinction Next Article Tax evaders’ life to be made difficult: Ishaq Dar Related Stories WhatsApp vulnerable to snooping: report The First Android Powered Nokia Smartphone is Finally Here 10 Secret Things You Didn’t Know You Could Do With Google Leave A Reply Cancel Reply Your Name (required) Your Email (required) Your Website (optional) Connect with Us 2863followers 42343likes 43followers You Might Also Like 10 Secret Things You Didn’t Know You Could Do With Google Google opens the door to wonders but if I say Google homepage is no less ...read more This Pakistani CEO Used Google Maps and a Cycle To Defeat Lahore’s Traffic Jam Hurdles are nothing if you are motivated enough and Monis Rahman, CEO of Rozee.pk, gave ...read more Microsoft Could Become The First Trillion Dollar Company Beating Apple & Google Microsoft currently has a market capitalization of around $492 billion but one analyst in particular ...read more Recent Posts 0 January 14, 2017 PIA launches Sky Show, a new inflight entertainment system 0 January 14, 2017 WhatsApp vulnerable to snooping: report 0 January 14, 2017 Over 100 endangered green turtles appear on Karachi coast Popular Post August 18, 2013 Pakistan Cruise Missiles Vs India Ballistic Missile Defense July 15, 2014 Ajit Doval: The Indian who wants to ‘destroy’ Pakistan?

Source: Mitya Aleshkovsky, Flickr. Every year, the Russian State Duma schedules laws to come into effect on January 1. In 2017, as ever, some of these laws seem poised to make positive contributions to Russian society and some…don't. This year, RuNet Echo marks the highlights and lowlights—from a law that will bring Russian court records online to the introduction of forced labor in some state correctional facilities. Тhe ‘Google Tax’ Beginning on January 1, certain foreign Internet retail companies will have to start paying a value added tax in Russia. Because the law affects companies that sell electronic books, music, movies, and computer programs, the legislation already has a moniker: the Google tax. Accordingly, Google has increased prices for Google Drive services and Google Play purchases by 18 percent. Disability and HIV Registries January 1 also marks the introduction of a federal registry for Russians who have the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The Russian Ministry of Health says it is introducing the registry to better understand the characteristics—and extent—of the country’s HIV problem: more than 1.5 million people, or more than 1 percent of the Russian population, have been diagnosed with HIV or AIDS. Earlier this year, Russian authorities announced that the Ural city of Yekaterinburg, Russia’s fourth-largest city, is facing an HIV epidemic. More than 1.8 percent of the city’s 1.4 million residents are infected with the virus. For now, inclusion on the registry is voluntary, though the list will provide the basis for the state’s provision of antiretroviral medication. Starting on the first of the year, the Russian Pension Fund will also introduce a registry of people with disabilities. Officials hope the registry will help people with disabilities find work and raise awareness about the benefits and programs to which people with disabilities are entitled. Russia has one of the largest gaps between the employment rate among people with disabilities and the employment rate among people without disabilities of any country, according to a recent study conducted by the International Labor Organization (ILO). More than 12 million Russians, or almost 9 percent of the country’s population, live with disabilities, including 620,000 children. New Rules for News Aggregators The New Year also brings a new set of rules for news aggregators in Russia. Aggregators whose daily traffic exceeds 1 million views will be considered media outlets in the eyes of the Russian government, forcing them to verify the truth of the news stories they republish—a nearly impossible task that seems to give the government license to crack down on the most popular aggregators in the country, including Yandex, Mail.ru, Google, and Bing. RuNet Echo extensively covered the introduction of this legislation and the government’s pressure (and backpedaling) on Google. Forced Labor As of the first of the year, Russian courts will be allowed to sentence defendants to forced labor in correctional centers around the country. Four large correctional facilities were scheduled to be opened on January 1—in the Siberian region of Tyumen, the Tambov region (southeast of Moscow), Stavropol Krai (in the North Caucasus), and Primorsky Krai (in the Far East)—in addition to seven smaller facilities across the country. The centers will not have the same degree of security as normal correctional facilities, and inmates will be allowed to leave if they get permission from administrators. They will not, however, be able to choose or change their jobs. After the law was introduced, Valery Maksimenko, the head of the Federal Penitentiary Service, said that forced labor would compare favorably with other kinds of punishment because convicts would not be isolated from society: “Forced labor in correctional centers, despite the name, can be compared to shift work for people who live in dormitories away from home.” Maksimenko’s assurance, however, will do little to assuage those who already see echoes of the Gulag in existing forms of labor in Russian penal colonies. Forced labor was included as a potential sanction in the Russian Criminal Code in 2011, but its introduction has been delayed multiple times since. Bringing Courts Online New Year's legislation will also bring Russian courts online—at least some of them. Moscow City and District courts are now accepting statements, appeals, and all other document submissions in electronic form, and court records are now searchable by the name of the individual involved, statute, and a variety of other ways. Only courts with the technical capacity to implement such a digitization will do so, however, meaning the vast majority of Russian courts won’t have websites like the Moscow court system, whose website is already up and running. In all, the Moscow digitization project took two years to implement and develop, and cost $172.4 million, $50 million of which came from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development Increasing the Retirement Age for State Employees Until the first of the year, the retirement age for Russian civil servants and municipal employees stood at 55 for women and 60 for men. Starting on January 1, the government will incrementally increase the retirement age to 63 for women and 65 for men at a rate of half a year per year (the age will increase until 2032 for women and and until 2026 for men). The government says the initiative is designed to keep qualified government employees in their jobs longer, and to reduce the strain of pensions on the federal budget. Higher Excise Taxes on Alcohol and Cigarettes Finally, beginning on the first of the year, Russian drinkers will have to pay higher excise taxes on beer, wine, champagne, cider, medovukha (a mead-like drink), and hard liquor. The excise tax on foreign champagne will increase by 10 rubles to 36 rubles per liter, and on domestic sparkling wine by 1 ruble to 14 rubles per liter. The tax rate on Russian wine will remain the same, while the tax on foreign wine will increase by 9 rubles to 18 rubles. Excise taxes on cigarettes and e-cigarettes will also increase over the next three years.

Although it what was perceived as a gimmick at first – largely because the novelty of using services such as Siri soon wore off after launch – voice technology has been gaining some momentum in recent years. As the technology has advanced, it has become more clever, and is now much better at understanding different voices and accents thrown at it. However, it has only been within the last year that it has truly taken off with the success of Amazon's Echo speaker, which features the ingenious Alexa smart assistant. The Amazon Echo, a voice-controlled virtual assistant (Photo: Reuters) Alexa has taken the world by storm due to the technology's ability to accurately comprehend human voices and thus translate the needs of the user without needing physical activation. This has spurred a new range of voice-activated devices at the world's biggest tech show, CES 2017, taking place in Las Vegas this week. Read More Total Recall to come true? Intel says virtual reality will replace need to go on holiday On Tuesday at CES, Korean electronics company LG announced a new fridge that's powered by Amazon Alexa, as well as a robot butler that uses Alexa's voice recognition technology to complete household tasks such as turning on the air conditioner or changing a dryer cycle. LG Alexa-powered fridge (Photo: LG) On the same day, Chinese tech firm Lenovo unveiled Smart Assistant, a speaker that houses Amazon’s Alexa brains in audio-expert Harman Kardon’s hardware. Ford has also teamed up with Amazon to enable drivers to listen to audiobooks inside the vehicle, search and transfer local destinations to navigation, request news, play music and add items to their shopping list using vocal commands. Read More Best 'smart home' robots of CES 2017 - including LG's Hub Robot, Kuri, Olly and Aristotle And the voice-activated virtual assistant CES announcements didn't end there. Google's Alexa rival, Assistant, will be making its way onto a slew of Android TVs from the likes of Sharp and Sony later this year. Gaming chip company Nvidia has also unveiled Spot, a hybrid microphone and speaker that uses Google Assistant, liberating from one static place, bringing it to every room of the house. Now you no longer need to shout at your smart speaker in order for it to hear you from another room. With Spot, you can communicate with various smart devices around your home from any place in the house (as long as you have a Spot installed there). Turn off the lights, change the temperature, set alarms, all with speech. Read More Best TVs of CES 2017 - including LG's 'wallpaper' TV, Samsung's QLED and Sony's glass speaker screen However, in order for Spot to work, you will need to have Nvidia's latest SHIELD gizmo. SHIELD is a console and TV entertainment streaming device, and acts as a central hub for all your Spots. Nvidia Spot powered by Google Assistant When it hits the market later this year, the Shield will be the first Android TV product to come with Google Assistant support. Priced at $199.99 (£160), the Shield is now available for pre-order, shipping later this month. Each Spot will set you back another $49.99 (£40), so the more rooms you need to cover, the more you'll need to shell out to cover your entire home. Spit has no release date yet, but Nvidia said it will arrive later this year.

And of course, many are hoping that Google's own smart speaker, Google Home, will launch in the UK in 2017. Google Home is currently only available in the US The Consumer Technology Association, which organises CES, predicts that smart home devices such as the Echo will drive a 1.5% growth in industry revenue in the US alone this year. "More and more consumers are discovering the remarkable benefits connected products deliver, providing any time, anywhere access to information, entertainment and each other," said Gary Shapiro, chief executive of the Consumer Technology Association. "Our forecast reinforces our belief that connectivity is going to be one of the driving trends of our time."

In particular, the world's two best players, Ke Jie of China and Park Jung-hwan of Korea, were on the lips of observers who were skeptical about the AI's ability in the Asian board game. However, Google has silenced doubters once and for all because its AlphaGo program has defeated all human champions, including Ke and Park, in online matches of late. In fact, users registered with two IDs of "Master" and "Magister" dominated two Korean and Chinese go platforms during the past weeks by scoring convincing victories over all outstanding go players. Because its style was similar to AlphaGo, people suspected that they would be new versions of AlphaGo, and DeepMind founder Demis Hassabis admitted earlier this week that they were. "We've been hard at work improving AlphaGo, and over the past few days we've played some unofficial online games at fast time controls with our new prototype version, to check that it's working as well as we hoped," he said. After the AlphaGo's landslide 4-1 victory against Lee last March, DeepMind has improved it at breakneck speed as Prof. Jeong Jae-seung at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) demonstrates. "I took part in a conference at Silicon Valley early December to learn that there are already many algorithms much better than those of AlphaGo," said Prof. Jeong, a renowned AI expert. "Just nine months after AlphaGo stunned the world, it has already become a legacy." Against this backdrop, pessimism says that humans would never beat AI in go and eventually most other areas. Ke, who downplayed AlphaGo's capabilities last year, acknowledged this time that human beings are now no match for AI in the board game that originated in East Asia millennia ago. He lost three times to the AlphaGo in disguise. Of note is that other countries are also channeling their funds and energy into the potential-loaded AI. And when it comes to go, Tokyo University came up with a Japanese version of AlphaGo, dubbed Deep Zen Go, last year to take on a Japanese champion Cho Chi-hun. It beat him once in a best-of-three series midway through last November. voc200@gmail.com   EXO wins fourth grand prize at Golden ... 'Korean animation needs to find own id...

About Techzim Contact Us Send a Tip Menu About Techzim Contact Us Send a Tip Search advertisement Homepage » Hardware & Software » Why I uninstalled Microsoft Office from my computer Why I uninstalled Microsoft Office from my computer Posted 6 Jan 2017 by Garikai Dzoma (@gdzoma) Read 18 Comments Truth be told I sort of tolerate the Windows Operating system for various reasons including the fact that it has better multimedia driver support and most accessories have plug and play support, while in my beloved Ubuntu I might have to go into the terminal to figure things out. Most importantly it’s the only way I can use Microsoft Office without having to pay Bill every other month. In the old days, all I had to do was buy a new laptop flip the lid, remove crapware that comes preloaded, install an antivirus and then I was good to go. Now things are decidedly different. I had to struggle to gain limited control on how I received my updates. Removing some of the useless applications like MSN Sports and other useless bandwidth hogging parts was unnecessarily hard. Office, it seems, is no longer preactivated To top all that off it seems the preinstalled version of Office that came with the laptop was not even activated! And that is where the trouble began. A tale of confusing licences Since I have sworn off pirated software I decided to find out how much it would cost me to get a licence. The array of licences available is mind-numbing and confusing. There are SPLA, FFP, OEM (I knew was not looking for this right away), USL and of course Volume Licensing where I have to pay Bill every month/year. advertisement After deciding I didn’t really want to spend an eye-popping $290 – families live off that kind of money- to buy glorified text editor I decided to have a look at volume licensing which looked cheaper. Only to be confronted by another endless iteration of options and tables. Later I discovered I had to pay $99 a year for the trouble of having One Note on my desktop. Then it got me thinking. Do I really need Office anymore? Do you really need Office? Like I said above there was a time when Ms Office was the mainstay of every office big and small. Google Docs was not even considered an alternative, it was clunky, lacked essential features, terrorised Internet Explorer and stretched it to its limits, required a very good internet connection and produced documents that were not exactly compatible. That was then. Now, Google Docs is a rival that Ms Office products have to contend with. While for nostalgic reasons people still tend to stick to Ms Office I don’t think the experience is worth the $99 a year experience. Add the fact that sometimes I just want to work from any device without being shackled by the fact that the demi-gods at Microsoft could not be bothered to port Office to it, Google Docs became a viable alternative. The last straw was when the Office Update Utility started chewing through my limited bandwidth in the middle of the day rendering my connection unusable. So I said no to Microsoft and decided to avail to Google one more facet of my life. Now the damn thing knows where I stay, the weather, what I look like, where I have been and just about everything else. Creepily it tells me when it’s time to go to work and alerts me when my secret football team is taking a thrashing. Getting some new love Prior to this change, I had only used Google Docs occasionally. While it takes time to get used to the interface the experience is not unpleasant. One feature that takes some getting used to is the autosave feature. You type something and it is saved almost instantly without hitting Ctrl + S. If you feign a British or American accent then there is voice typing to give your fingers a rest but it seems for all its omniscience Google still struggles to spell Tapiwa. You also get access to common fonts such as Calibri plus the shipload of Google’s famous web safe fonts. A word of warning using these fonts would require the person to whom you are sending the document to, to download the fonts if they are using an offline document viewer such as Ms Office 2013 to view the document properly. The interface is uncluttered and distraction free allowing your to focus on the task at hand. You can also Google search to include links or find the meanings of various words, use a thesaurus and most importantly share and collaborate with others with ease. I am sure Ms Office’s cloud offerings have features to match these and to be fair but Google Docs comes with free 15 GB storage and if I want a paid version I have to pay $5 a month without going through a licensing ballet. I don’t even have to think about back-ups anymore. You can also extend Google Docs using many of the offered add-ons. For the first time, I can spell the word café the way it’s supposed to be spelt without going through hoops. Don’t believe me? Try spelling MØ in Word. The internet catch One serious drawback of using Google Drive is that you need a constant and decent internet connection otherwise you will go bald as you constantly pull out your hair in frustration. Sure you can edit a document offline for a while but the suit is supposed to be used online. A counter-argument can be made that Ms Office requires regular large updates to be downloaded and applied which means an internet connection would still be required but it will not stop working even if you don’t update it so. Also while their version of Excel (it’s really called a spreadsheet) is decent when it comes to advanced features it’s just crap. It cannot even properly import CVS files generated by Google themselves which is pretty embarrassing. You could also check LibreOffice LibreOffice is touted as a FOSS Ms Office alternative. Personally, I don’t believe that at all. I personally detest it myself but some people swear by it. So if you do not have a constant internet connection you can try that route. Stay away from OpenOffice while you are at it. It receives less frequent updates and I can predict its ultimate demise in the next coming months or years. Last words To be clear I did not uninstall Office because it was terrible, it just that for me, and I would guess for most people, there is really no compelling reason to choose it above its competitors anymore. That, plus Google Docs is pretty awesome you should give it a try. share Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Tags: Google, Microsoft Office, office 365 Previous Post « Some light at the end of the tunnel for local gamers.

Notepad++ and you’re in heaven. This ‘Everybody Hates Microsoft’ mantra is getting old. We all know the alternatives are all trying to replicate Windows and MS Office with laughable results. We use Google for Business in our company for email and storage requirements, and we get all sorts of issues with missing files, failed syncs, you-name-it. We miss the features of Outlook and Google deliberately killed compatibility with Outlook for their enterprise email service. The truth of the matter is the world runs on Windows and Microsoft deserves some credit for that Reply Garikai Dzoma says: January 6, 2017 at 11:23 AM Read again slowly this time. My uninstalling Office has nothing to do with hating Microsoft. I run bash in Windows! I and a lot of ppl cannot afford it Reply Tsenny says: January 6, 2017 at 12:01 PM PS: Volume Licensing From my experience with Volume Licensing, its is just a term most usually for organisations whereby an organisation requires multiple licenses of the Microsoft product eg the MS Office, but they do not require multiple copies of the installation media. It is cheap in the sense that you get only 1 DVD but your license can have the number of activations or seats that you require e.g for 50 users. That is how the cheapness comes about in that they do not need to ship to you 50 DVDs. What you are actually referring to as having to pay a bill every month if I am not mistaken is Office365. Reply Tsenny says: January 6, 2017 at 12:05 PM For MS Office Licenses, the licenses are perpertual and what you expires every 24 months is the Software Assurance which gives you the ability to upgrade to a new version if Microsoft brings in a new version of the software and your Software Assurance is still valid. Yes Microsoft licensing is confusing Reply Lawrence says: January 6, 2017 at 12:38 PM Thanks Tsenny and EMC. Sometimes I feel the articles on TECHZim, while aimed at addressing some tech issue, lack sufficient investigation that would make them more informative. They end up sounding like posts on a personal blog where there is no editorial moderation. And for some of us, being non-core techies, we will be hoping to read insightful articles on tech as it affects us, how we can make it easier to use, general news, etc. Like how Tsenny just described MS Office licensing in 2 short paragraphs, leaving me with sufficient detail that at least the amount I spend will be once off, but the licensing is confusing. And to the writer, from a PR point of view, “never tell a person who has taken the time to read your writing that they should “read again more slowly this time”. It’s rude. I am saying this from the point of view of both a writer, reader and consumer. Reply Garikai Dzoma says: January 6, 2017 at 1:10 PM Sigh, I apologize for being insensitive, too much time at Stack Exchange and hacker forums where you speak your mind next time I will buy a candle and we will hug it out. I am not speaking for the editor but when I write, and for most tech blogs like ZDNet, Techcrunch, Wired and a gazillion others out there, each writer has his/her little nook and cranny. We know for example that Ernesto from torrentfreak hates the DCMA, Joey from OMGUbuntu loves his cat etc it’s just how it is. I cannot, and will never write about something that I don’t know. I will never even pretend to be unbiased, that is a Western media fiction just compare Fox News and ABC for example and you will know there is never such a thing as a balanced opinion. The point of the article was Ms Office licensing is expensive and stupid compared to how they used to do it. The caustic remark was meant to point out the fact that I was talking about Word Processing and the comment is telling me to use Notepad ! and Notepad++. For the record I use Sublime Text and Atom whenever I need a text editor. Now I will admit I have done it myself countless times: I see the title and scroll down to the comment section to leave a comment without even reading the article. Reply surur says: January 6, 2017 at 7:16 PM The licensing is only confusing because Garikai was looking for a work around to paying full price. For consumers there are really only two options – 1) pay full price for the boxed copy or 2) pay for Office 365 Home. All the other licensing models are for schools and businesses or PC builders, and are not intended for regular consumers. This is the same ridiculous complaint we see about there being 11 versions of Windows . Windows Server is not for granny at home. She either gets Windows with her PC, buys a boxed copy in the store (where there will only be Pro and Home) or purchase an upgrade from the online store, where there will only be Pro and Home. Reply TheKing says: January 6, 2017 at 12:50 PM WPS is the best Microsoft Office alternative for Linux. WPS Writer matches or is actually better than Word. Reply Garikai Dzoma says: January 6, 2017 at 1:12 PM No argument here. It’s just I cannot afford it anymore. Reply Lennon says: January 6, 2017 at 1:12 PM I am selling Microsoft Office 2016 Pro Plus activation key only for $35. Reply Macd Chip says: January 6, 2017 at 2:26 PM I have read this and as someone who buys MS Office (Full Pro) almost every month, l can say this is not clearly explained, its a mixed bag of ideas. We need to clearly distinguish which office we are talking about! Is it online office or offline office. Its a rule, if you are using SaaS, the features are limited compared to offline. One such SaaS is MS Office 365. Licensing can be cheap because you can rent it when you need it, and stop when you do not want it. I have both Libre Office and MS Pro on my PC, l still believe Libre is the easier no brainer replacement for MS offline installations. Reply Lawrence says: January 6, 2017 at 3:38 PM Exactly my point.. the original article is going everywhere else except somewhere specific. Have found more insight from the comments section than the original article. That being said, being a technocrat in an area and supping with the Techcrunch, Google or any of those big guys does not make one a good article writer. One should invest time in learning how to write effectively. Reply NdiniNdadaro says: January 6, 2017 at 2:55 PM I use cracked version much like Rhodes took the land without paying. Reply Macd Chip says: January 6, 2017 at 3:30 PM cracked version on works for offline usage, the day it will call home is the day you will kiss it goodbye Reply Tom says: January 7, 2017 at 2:29 AM TechZim, your articles are becoming poorer and poorer by the day. Everytime i read ur articles since u decided to diversify from being a tech only site i am disappointed. Guys u r putting too much off ur emotions and little research in the topic at hand. Your articles are now more of click bait than informative. What have i learned from your article? i hv learned that u dont like that Microsoft dorminates the word editor space. while its ur opinion u didnt fully research on how to get a licence to use Office and which type of user each license suits , u just complained how u dont want to pay money to use Office. this article is good for a teenage blog not a site which aims to inform people. In a nutshell, too much self opinion less facts (this has bn happening for some time ) Reply peterc says: January 7, 2017 at 9:37 AM LibreOffice user here. Not the best thing since sliced bread but it solves most of my problems. Reply Joe says: January 8, 2017 at 10:17 AM I’ve been using Google docs extensively over the last few years. But here is one simple example of many as to why you should not get rid of word and rely solely on Google docs. Write a simple 5 page document in Google docs. Now go to page 3 of the document and start page numbering on that page instead. You won’t be able to. Google states it. There are several simple things like that are missing in docs that is infuriating. I always end up going back to word.

About Future Staff Contact Privacy Policy Search for: Select Press Releases Home / Press Releases / Google Honors Native American Author and NativeAmericanJewelry.com Reciprocates Google Honors Native American Author and NativeAmericanJewelry.com Reciprocates Posted on January 6, 2017 by Benzinga Full Feed in Press Releases Conceptual image of a businessman holding big hammer Google recently honored one of the greatest Native American writers of the modern era by celebrating, James Welch, his 76th birthday with a Google homepage image. The jewelry company, NativeAmericanJewelry.com pays homage to the author as well with their latest release. (PRWEB) January 06, 2017 NativeAmericanJewelry.com is a company that works with Native artists from the Southwest region to expose their work to the larger public. From the day they were founded, the organization’s goal has been to collect great pieces of art and show people the art, history, and culture of Native Americans. Recently, Google has honored one of the most celebrated writers in Native American culture today, James Welch. Both his poetry and novels have been received by the public in great regard. One of his stories, Winter in the Blood, was adapted into a feature film by fellow Native American writer Sherman Alexie. It’s no surprise that Google would choose to honor such a great figure in Native American culture, especially since the recent uproar with the Standing Rock pipeline protests. NativeAmericanJewelry.com spokesman, Steven Onida, has been working with the company’s artists to create a new collection centered on one of Welch’s most famous poems, “Dreaming Winter,” which intimately describes a moment in Welch’s life, living on 40 acres of land in Montana during his youth. Onida commented, “I have great admiration and respect for Welch’s work. The beauty of nature is something we can all take from and Welch describes the lasting elegance of nature in a refined tone that all readers can relate to.” The latest collection brings together a series of pieces from Native American artists that embody the wonderful beauty and spirit of nature. Among the many pieces featured in this new collection, people will be able to find turquoise necklaces from the Navajo tribe, Hopi sterling silver rings by acclaimed artist George Phillips, and Zuni multi-stone bracelets. The beautiful art inspired by the Native American community is something that NativeAmericanJewelry.com seeks to preserve with their collaboration efforts and hopes people will take advantage of the company’s latest selection. Onida ended his comments with, “We’ve worked hard to bring this collection to the public, but what we really want people to know is the heart and soul the artists put into these pieces to make them truly unique and beautiful. In the words of Welch, ‘Let me join / the other kings, the ones who trade their knives / for a sack of keys. Let me open any door, / stand winter still and drown in a common dream.’” People that are interested in checking out the collection and the other Native American jewelry the company has to offer can browse their site, here.

Google Glass augmented reality spectacles are no longer available to the general public, but continue to be used for industrial and medical purposes. Google wiped out Glass data and started a new project known as Aura. Project Wing was Google’s alternative to Amazon’s delivery drones. There is the modular smartphone initiative known as Project Ara that got shelved. Hardware by google keeps tanking. Google print ads, Google Wave, Google Nexus Q, Google Lively have all failed. Yet Google as a company continues to grow, and is the most profitable wing of its parent company, Alphabet. The technology offerings by Google are ubiquitous. Gmail, Google Drive, Google Maps, and YouTube are all essential parts of the internet. What is it that makes Google repeatedly fail, and yet keep growing as a company? Sundar Pichai’s interaction with students at his alma mater, IIT-KGP, might shed some light on the issue. Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google was asked at the interaction with students from IIT-KGP, the institution he passed out from before heading to US, “What is it that drives innovation at Google?” Pichai replied “I think we have always had an ambitious approach to it. We call it internally as 10x or moonshots. We try to work on things which people will use every day, it will apply to billions of people, and it solves a real problem for them. So that is the bar, anything we try to do, we think of it that way. We aim high, we try to use deep computer science to anything we approach, so that we can have a differentiated approach to solving it. And you want to aim high enough that you fail a few times. That is the natural part of the process.” Google’s parent company, Alphabet has a history of starting expensive projects, known as “moonshots” or the “other bets.” These include the secretive Project X for self driving cars, Google Fiber, and internet service provider, and Google Glass. Successful moonshots include YouTube, Google Play, Google Wallet and Google Earth. The moonshot projects are expensive efforts, and the risk Alphabet takes with them is high. Pichai went on to elaborate “In fact Larry used to say if you work on really difficult things, you are better off because you have no competition. Others are not working on that difficult a problem. And even if you fail, you end up doing something great in the process. I think that is the philosophy which has guided us all through these years.” The company’s philosophy is to aim so high that failure is virtually guaranteed. It is a part of the process of what makes Google works, and the reason why Google has so many successful projects. There are few other tech company owners that keep their companies teetering on the line between wild success and disaster. The only other individual with companies constantly on the brink of disaster due to investments in seemingly impossible undertakings is Elon Musk.

For most of us, that is a long bucket load of things like learning a new language or practising yoga. The Google Calendar automatically monitored your routine and swapped things around to figure out the best time to follow your routine. Now Google has updated Goals with support for Apple Health and Google Fit. What this means, is that any health-related goals you may have, like cycling or Yoga, it will automatically monitor how you are doing a certain activity and will mark it completed when you achieve that goal. It’s also smart enough to reschedule activities that you tend to start late or miss so that you can follow through on the goals that you have set for yourself. The update also adds a new performance tracker and history along with a link that can take you quickly to your fitness app. Per the blog post by Google “With this integration, future goal times will be even more tailored based on when you’re most likely to complete them. Say you set a goal to run at 6:30 every other morning but aren’t actually hitting your stride until 7:15 — Google Calendar has you covered and will adjust accordingly. So not only can Calendar keep track of your activities and performance, it can also help you find the best time to do them.” Hopefully, this will mean more people stick to their New Year’s resolutions this year.

The best quality Google’s smart voice assistant has to offer is its delivery of relevant information from the web. Google AI is not only designed to deliver the accurate information of your queries. It can also entertain you by playing music and videos on demand. At CES in Las Vegas, Google has announced that it is planning to bring its intelligent voice assistant to smartTVs, smartwatches, and cars. So now your future Android TVs, Android Wear, and even the car system will be embedded with Google’s smart AI. Let’s explore the idea behind this. Google’s AI for Android TVs and Wearables Google’s rival companies have already introduced their AIs like Siri and Alexa to Android TV and set-top boxes. And now Google’s planning to embed its interesting and smart voice assistant to its other Android devices like Android televisions and wearables. Those who are using smartTVs like to stream online media apps like Netflix, YouTube, etc. And with the help of voice assistant, you can easily play the media content just by asking Google AI. You can even connect your home devices such as lights, speakers and ask questions about your requirements like “what are VR devices?” Related: Asus ZenFone Powered by Snapdragon 835 To Be Unveiled at CES 2017 No need for Google Home If Google will embed its smart voice assistant to its entire Android devices, then there will be no need for Google Home. Every Android device will act as the Google Home. There will be many opportunities to say “OK Google.” Related: Verizon Google Pixel, Pixel XL Available On January 11 In the coming months, devices, like the Nvidia Shield, and Xiaomi Mi Box, will require a voice remote to control their on-demand activities. But Google’s Android TVs will completely work hands-free, so you can manage the assistant from anywhere in your home without picking any device.

Most importantly it’s the only way I can use Microsoft Office without having to pay Bill every other month. In the old days, all I had to do was buy a new laptop flip the lid, remove crapware that comes preloaded, install an antivirus and then I was good to go. Now things are decidedly different. I had to struggle to gain limited control on how I received my updates. Removing some of the useless applications like MSN Sports and other useless bandwidth hogging parts was unnecessarily hard. Office, it seems, is no longer preactivated To top all that off it seems the preinstalled version of Office that came with the laptop was not even activated! And that is where the trouble began. A tale of confusing licences Since I have sworn off pirated software I decided to find out how much it would cost me to get a licence. The array of licences available is mind-numbing and confusing. There are SPLA, FFP, OEM (I knew was not looking for this right away), USL and of course Volume Licensing where I have to pay Bill every month/year. advertisement After deciding I didn’t really want to spend an eye-popping $290 – families live off that kind of money- to buy glorified text editor I decided to have a look at volume licensing which looked cheaper. Only to be confronted by another endless iteration of options and tables. Later I discovered I had to pay $99 a year for the trouble of having One Note on my desktop. Then it got me thinking. Do I really need Office anymore? Do you really need Office? Like I said above there was a time when Ms Office was the mainstay of every office big and small. Google Docs was not even considered an alternative, it was clunky, lacked essential features, terrorised Internet Explorer and stretched it to its limits, required a very good internet connection and produced documents that were not exactly compatible. That was then. Now, Google Docs is a rival that Ms Office products have to contend with. While for nostalgic reasons people still tend to stick to Ms Office I don’t think the experience is worth the $99 a year experience. Add the fact that sometimes I just want to work from any device without being shackled by the fact that the demi-gods at Microsoft could not be bothered to port Office to it, Google Docs became a viable alternative. The last straw was when the Office Update Utility started chewing through my limited bandwidth in the middle of the day rendering my connection unusable. So I said no to Microsoft and decided to avail to Google one more facet of my life. Now the damn thing knows where I stay, the weather, what I look like, where I have been and just about everything else. Creepily it tells me when it’s time to go to work and alerts me when my secret football team is taking a thrashing. Getting some new love Prior to this change, I had only used Google Docs occasionally. While it takes time to get used to the interface the experience is not unpleasant. One feature that takes some getting used to is the autosave feature. You type something and it is saved almost instantly without hitting Ctrl + S. If you feign a British or American accent then there is voice typing to give your fingers a rest but it seems for all its omniscience Google still struggles to spell Tapiwa. You also get access to common fonts such as Calibri plus the shipload of Google’s famous web safe fonts. A word of warning using these fonts would require the person to whom you are sending the document to, to download the fonts if they are using an offline document viewer such as Ms Office 2013 to view the document properly. The interface is uncluttered and distraction free allowing your to focus on the task at hand. You can also Google search to include links or find the meanings of various words, use a thesaurus and most importantly share and collaborate with others with ease. I am sure Ms Office’s cloud offerings have features to match these and to be fair but Google Docs comes with free 15 GB storage and if I want a paid version I have to pay $5 a month without going through a licensing ballet. I don’t even have to think about back-ups anymore. You can also extend Google Docs using many of the offered add-ons. For the first time, I can spell the word café the way it’s supposed to be spelt without going through hoops. Don’t believe me? Try spelling MØ in Word. The internet catch One serious drawback of using Google Drive is that you need a constant and decent internet connection otherwise you will go bald as you constantly pull out your hair in frustration. Sure you can edit a document offline for a while but the suit is supposed to be used online. A counter-argument can be made that Ms Office requires regular large updates to be downloaded and applied which means an internet connection would still be required but it will not stop working even if you don’t update it so. Also while their version of Excel (it’s really called a spreadsheet) is decent when it comes to advanced features it’s just crap. It cannot even properly import CVS files generated by Google themselves which is pretty embarrassing. You could also check LibreOffice LibreOffice is touted as a FOSS Ms Office alternative. Personally, I don’t believe that at all. I personally detest it myself but some people swear by it. So if you do not have a constant internet connection you can try that route. Stay away from OpenOffice while you are at it. It receives less frequent updates and I can predict its ultimate demise in the next coming months or years. Last words To be clear I did not uninstall Office because it was terrible, it just that for me, and I would guess for most people, there is really no compelling reason to choose it above its competitors anymore. That, plus Google Docs is pretty awesome you should give it a try. share Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Tags: Google, Microsoft Office, office 365 Previous Post « Some light at the end of the tunnel for local gamers.

Notepad++ and you’re in heaven. This ‘Everybody Hates Microsoft’ mantra is getting old. We all know the alternatives are all trying to replicate Windows and MS Office with laughable results. We use Google for Business in our company for email and storage requirements, and we get all sorts of issues with missing files, failed syncs, you-name-it. We miss the features of Outlook and Google deliberately killed compatibility with Outlook for their enterprise email service. The truth of the matter is the world runs on Windows and Microsoft deserves some credit for that Reply Garikai Dzoma says: January 6, 2017 at 11:23 AM Read again slowly this time. My uninstalling Office has nothing to do with hating Microsoft. I run bash in Windows! I and a lot of ppl cannot afford it Reply Tsenny says: January 6, 2017 at 12:01 PM PS: Volume Licensing From my experience with Volume Licensing, its is just a term most usually for organisations whereby an organisation requires multiple licenses of the Microsoft product eg the MS Office, but they do not require multiple copies of the installation media. It is cheap in the sense that you get only 1 DVD but your license can have the number of activations or seats that you require e.g for 50 users. That is how the cheapness comes about in that they do not need to ship to you 50 DVDs. What you are actually referring to as having to pay a bill every month if I am not mistaken is Office365. Reply Tsenny says: January 6, 2017 at 12:05 PM For MS Office Licenses, the licenses are perpertual and what you expires every 24 months is the Software Assurance which gives you the ability to upgrade to a new version if Microsoft brings in a new version of the software and your Software Assurance is still valid. Yes Microsoft licensing is confusing Reply Lawrence says: January 6, 2017 at 12:38 PM Thanks Tsenny and EMC. Sometimes I feel the articles on TECHZim, while aimed at addressing some tech issue, lack sufficient investigation that would make them more informative. They end up sounding like posts on a personal blog where there is no editorial moderation. And for some of us, being non-core techies, we will be hoping to read insightful articles on tech as it affects us, how we can make it easier to use, general news, etc. Like how Tsenny just described MS Office licensing in 2 short paragraphs, leaving me with sufficient detail that at least the amount I spend will be once off, but the licensing is confusing. And to the writer, from a PR point of view, “never tell a person who has taken the time to read your writing that they should “read again more slowly this time”. It’s rude. I am saying this from the point of view of both a writer, reader and consumer. Reply Garikai Dzoma says: January 6, 2017 at 1:10 PM Sigh, I apologize for being insensitive, too much time at Stack Exchange and hacker forums where you speak your mind next time I will buy a candle and we will hug it out. I am not speaking for the editor but when I write, and for most tech blogs like ZDNet, Techcrunch, Wired and a gazillion others out there, each writer has his/her little nook and cranny. We know for example that Ernesto from torrentfreak hates the DCMA, Joey from OMGUbuntu loves his cat etc it’s just how it is. I cannot, and will never write about something that I don’t know. I will never even pretend to be unbiased, that is a Western media fiction just compare Fox News and ABC for example and you will know there is never such a thing as a balanced opinion. The point of the article was Ms Office licensing is expensive and stupid compared to how they used to do it. The caustic remark was meant to point out the fact that I was talking about Word Processing and the comment is telling me to use Notepad ! and Notepad++. For the record I use Sublime Text and Atom whenever I need a text editor. Now I will admit I have done it myself countless times: I see the title and scroll down to the comment section to leave a comment without even reading the article. Reply surur says: January 6, 2017 at 7:16 PM The licensing is only confusing because Garikai was looking for a work around to paying full price. For consumers there are really only two options – 1) pay full price for the boxed copy or 2) pay for Office 365 Home. All the other licensing models are for schools and businesses or PC builders, and are not intended for regular consumers. This is the same ridiculous complaint we see about there being 11 versions of Windows . Windows Server is not for granny at home. She either gets Windows with her PC, buys a boxed copy in the store (where there will only be Pro and Home) or purchase an upgrade from the online store, where there will only be Pro and Home. Reply TheKing says: January 6, 2017 at 12:50 PM WPS is the best Microsoft Office alternative for Linux. WPS Writer matches or is actually better than Word. Reply Garikai Dzoma says: January 6, 2017 at 1:12 PM No argument here. It’s just I cannot afford it anymore. Reply Lennon says: January 6, 2017 at 1:12 PM I am selling Microsoft Office 2016 Pro Plus activation key only for $35. Reply Macd Chip says: January 6, 2017 at 2:26 PM I have read this and as someone who buys MS Office (Full Pro) almost every month, l can say this is not clearly explained, its a mixed bag of ideas. We need to clearly distinguish which office we are talking about! Is it online office or offline office. Its a rule, if you are using SaaS, the features are limited compared to offline. One such SaaS is MS Office 365. Licensing can be cheap because you can rent it when you need it, and stop when you do not want it. I have both Libre Office and MS Pro on my PC, l still believe Libre is the easier no brainer replacement for MS offline installations. Reply Lawrence says: January 6, 2017 at 3:38 PM Exactly my point.. the original article is going everywhere else except somewhere specific. Have found more insight from the comments section than the original article. That being said, being a technocrat in an area and supping with the Techcrunch, Google or any of those big guys does not make one a good article writer. One should invest time in learning how to write effectively. Reply NdiniNdadaro says: January 6, 2017 at 2:55 PM I use cracked version much like Rhodes took the land without paying. Reply Macd Chip says: January 6, 2017 at 3:30 PM cracked version on works for offline usage, the day it will call home is the day you will kiss it goodbye Reply Tom says: January 7, 2017 at 2:29 AM TechZim, your articles are becoming poorer and poorer by the day. Everytime i read ur articles since u decided to diversify from being a tech only site i am disappointed. Guys u r putting too much off ur emotions and little research in the topic at hand. Your articles are now more of click bait than informative. What have i learned from your article? i hv learned that u dont like that Microsoft dorminates the word editor space. while its ur opinion u didnt fully research on how to get a licence to use Office and which type of user each license suits , u just complained how u dont want to pay money to use Office. this article is good for a teenage blog not a site which aims to inform people. In a nutshell, too much self opinion less facts (this has bn happening for some time ) Reply peterc says: January 7, 2017 at 9:37 AM LibreOffice user here. Not the best thing since sliced bread but it solves most of my problems. Reply Joe says: January 8, 2017 at 10:17 AM I’ve been using Google docs extensively over the last few years. But here is one simple example of many as to why you should not get rid of word and rely solely on Google docs. Write a simple 5 page document in Google docs. Now go to page 3 of the document and start page numbering on that page instead. You won’t be able to. Google states it. There are several simple things like that are missing in docs that is infuriating. I always end up going back to word.

Rise in 'always listening' smart assistants raises major privacy fears At CES gadget show in Las Vegas, Whirlpool, Samsung and other manufacturers are unveiling new ways to use voice services Authorities investigating the slaying of an Arkansas man to obtain voice recordings collected by an Amazon Echo speaker and its Alexa digital assistant  By Associated Press Published: 16:32 EST, 5 January 2017 | Updated: 18:28 EST, 5 January 2017 e-mail 94 shares 49 View comments Alexa, are you spying on me? It's a fair question in light of attempts by authorities investigating the slaying of an Arkansas man to obtain voice recordings collected by an Amazon Echo speaker and its Alexa digital assistant. Yet the popularity and capabilities of voice-enabled products such as the Echo continue to grow.  At the CES gadget show in Las Vegas, which opened Thursday, Whirlpool, Samsung and other manufacturers are unveiling new ways to use voice services to control laundry machines, refrigerators and other home systems. John Herrington, senior vice president of Samsung Electronics America, unveils new refrigerators with Family Hub 2.0 during a Samsung news conference before CES International, Wednesday, Jan. 4, 2017, in Las Vegas. Family Hub 2.0 features an interface on the refrigerator with apps that can be controlled by voice recognition. (AP Photo/John Locher) ALEXA'S TAKEAWAY  Prime members can ask Alexa to reorder from Amazon Restaurants by saying a restaurant name or cuisine type, for example, 'Alexa, order sushi from Amazon Restaurants.'  The service pulls a customer's order history from a specified restaurant or cuisine type and lists meal options available for reorder.  The selected meal is then sent for delivery to a customer's default address.  Consumers are apparently willing to trade a certain amount of privacy for convenience. So what exactly is being collected, stored or shared ? To work, the Echo is always listening.  Once it hears someone utter a keyword, such as 'Alexa,' it shares what it hears with Amazon's servers to process a response.  Those conversations are then stored indefinitely.  Google's Home speaker works in a similar fashion. The Echo 'has to listen to everything. That's kind of disturbing,' said Ryan O'Leary, vice president of WhiteHat Security's threat research center.  'It doesn't capture voice until it hears the keyword, but it could.  'You're trusting the devices to not do that, but it's entirely possible.'

Share this article Share 94 shares In the Arkansas case, authorities investigating the death of a man found floating face-up in a hot tub at a friend's home requested the contents of the home's Echo and Amazon's stored recordings in hopes they might contain evidence.  The friend is charged with murder. A judge has signed off on the search, but Amazon has balked.  Amazon has declined to comment specifically on the case but said the company objects to 'overbroad or otherwise inappropriate demands as a matter of course.' Some experts worry that allowing such a search would erode people's privacy. DID ALEXA WITNESS A MURDER?  Amazon said it objects to 'overbroad' requests as a matter of practice Authorities investigating the death of an Arkansas man whose body was found in a hot tub want to expand the probe to include a new kind of evidence: any comments overheard by the suspect's Amazon Echo smart speaker. Amazon said it objects to 'overbroad' requests as a matter of practice, but prosecutors insist their idea is rooted in a legal precedent that's 'as old as Methuselah.' The issue emerged in the slaying of Victor Collins, who was found floating face-up last year in the hot tub at a friend's home in Bentonville, about 150 miles northwest of Little Rock.  The friend, James Andrew Bates, was later charged with murder. Prosecutors have asked the court to force Amazon to provide data from the Echo that could reveal more clues about the night of Nov. 22, 2015, when Collins was apparently strangled and drowned.    'It's not necessarily a direct threat for the average person, but the same thing can be said with any kind of privacy concern,' O'Leary said.  'People say you shouldn't be concerned if you're not doing anything wrong, but that's a dangerous precedent to set.' Meanwhile, companies keep asking consumers to invite them into their homes. Whirlpool is adding Alexa voice control to its smart-home appliances, including a washing machine, a stove and a refrigerator.  Someone can instruct the oven to pre-heat to 400 degrees by speaking a command to an Alexa-enabled device, such as the Echo. The Bonjour voice-controlled alarm and personal assistant is on display at the Holi booth during CES Unveiled before CES International, Tuesday, Jan. 3, 2017, in Las Vegas. (AP Photo/John Locher) Simplehuman has a voice-activated trash can, and GE Lighting has a table lamp using Alexa voice control. For now, voice control is mainly an add-on feature rather than a core component of gadgets. It's there for those who want to use it, but it's not essential for the product to function. Many manufacturers are opting to use Amazon's Alexa service for now, though some are embracing voice systems from Google, Apple or Samsung. Nvidia's Shield TV streaming device, for instance, employs Google's Assistant service so viewers can control video playback or find out the weather with just a voice command. Meanwhile, Samsung's new Family Hub lets people use their voice to add items to shopping lists and order groceries online. CES chief economist Shawn DuBravac said as many as 700 companies could announce Alexa-integrated products during the gadget show, on top of more than 1,500 existing ones. As the smart home becomes more entrenched, DuBravac said, voice control could change the way we interact with technology in much the way the mouse did in the 1980s. 'Connected microphones are starting to appear in everything from cars to children's toys,' said James Plouffe, lead solutions architect at mobile-security company MobileIron. 'Consumers should think carefully about how comfortable they are with the prospect of a live mic in common household items.' Because Amazon says it uses information gathered by the Echo to improve its voice technology, that information has the potential to 'live forever' online, Plouffe said. The issue first grabbed headlines a couple of years ago, after Samsung said sensitive conversations could be captured by its voice-controlled smart TVs. WHAT IS AMAZON ECHO?  Amazon Echo is a voice-controlled smart speaker that works alongside a smartphone app. Using a virtual assistant called Alexa, the speaker can respond to voice commands from the user, such as setting an alarm or ordering a cab. Echo also works with services like Spotify as a 360-degree wireless speaker.  The Amazon Echo and smaller Echo Dot speakers were launched in the UK in September in black and white   Based on the flood of new voice-controlled gadgets headed to market, tech companies are betting that consumers will get over their fears. Derrick Dicol, executive director of Comcast's Xfinity home, which uses voice controls in its home automation products, noted that people had to get used to sharing their banking information online. 'This is less invasive than that,' he said. 'It's just a different thing people have to feel comfortable with.'  A refrigerator with Family Hub 2.0 is on display during a Samsung news conference before CES International, Wednesday, Jan. 4, 2017, in Las Vegas.

Name: Subject: Message: Google acquires Limes Audio to improve Hangouts audio quality Newsby Mitja Rutnik1 week ago 3 206 24 In a recent blog post, Google announced that it has acquired Limes Audio. The company, which is based in Sweden, is in the business of making voice communication systems sound better. It’s flagship product called TrueVoice is described as an advanced speech enhancement software that promises to improve voice call quality through acoustic echo cancellation, noise reduction, and automatic microphone mixing. The technology that the Swedish company developed will now be used in Google’s video conferencing solutions including Hangouts. Google said that it wants to improve the audio quality of its products as an increasing number of their customers — especially business customers — are relying on the company’s video conferencing solutions for online meetings. See also: Google Calendar can now connect to Google Fit and Apple Health 1 week ago Limes Audio’s technology will improve the audio quality of Google’s products by removing distracting noises, distortion as well as echoes that users normally experience during an online meeting. The call quality gets worse if the internet connection is poor, which is another problem that the technology developed by the Swedish company takes on. We’re not quite sure when the new technology will be integrated into Google’s products, as the company has not shared this piece of information with the public yet. The online search giant also didn’t reveal how much it spent to acquire Limes Audio, which was founded 10 years ago by Fredric Lindström and Christian Schüldt.

However, for every useful tool, there is one that is completely useless. So, how do you find out which ones are real and which ones have been rendered incapable? Being able to track flights, learn a language, or even shop for our favorite items, are but a few luxuries we can enjoy at our fingertips, and most of us know how to utilize those tools. Read on to find out a number of other tried and trusted internet hacks, plus some incredibly useful tips you may not know about to make your whole Internet experience much more enjoyable: Calculate with your favorite search engine Google can be used to search for almost any information. If it is on the Internet, it is somewhere on Google. But did you know that Google can also help you with any math equation? Simply type in “Google calculator” and right in front of your eyes you will be presented with a calculator as large as you like – no fiddling with little buttons on a calculator that can lead to big mistakes. Better still, it calculates as quickly as your Internet allows, which is usually much faster than trying to locate your calculator! Conversion made easy Wondering how much butter you should use to bake a cake or what the temperature is in Fahrenheit? The same formula can be used with Google. Just type the value (e.g. 30 meters in feet) and voila! Use Google to find official metric conversion charts like this one. The magic K button Pausing a YouTube video can be done with your mouse or by using the space bar, but this method does, on occasion, cause it to skip the page instead. If you use your K button instead, you will be able to pause and restart a video easily on YouTube. Simple and effective! Entertainment in one click Entertainment isn’t just limited to videos anymore, and can actually refer to online gaming. Online gambling entertainment sites like bet365 can be played for endless hours at your leisure. You will be able to enjoy free bonuses for poker, slots, or other table games. You can test the games and find the ones that you like best. This is a great way to indulge in your favorite guilty pleasure with state-of-the-art software. Research instantly It takes time to find the right website for research work and sometimes we don’t feel like browsing through endless amounts of information to read about one thing that we need to write a paper on. By pressing Ctrl and F at the same time you can easily search for what you need online and find it right away. Definitions galore! It’s good to learn a new word every day and you can easily get definitions for words that you don’t understand. Just type the word “define” along with the word you wish to look up (e.g. define hospitality) in Google, and you will receive an accurate definition, plus synonyms. If the synonyms the search has to offer aren’t good enough for you, try taking a look at an alternative online thesaurus resource. Zooming in and out easily If you don’t have your glasses on hand and you would like to see what you are doing online, you can easily adjust the size of the text simply by pushing Ctrl and using the + or – button. Get rid of annoying cookies Slow performance and endless loading periods are usually a result of cookie clutter in your browser. Simply clear them with your browser settings to get back to browsing more quickly.[1] Flight tracking As mentioned at the start of the article, you can track flights with Google. Simply have the flight number ready and type it in the search engine box. You will instantly have all the information you need in order to keep track of your flight. You can try any or all of the internet hacks provided above. They are all designed to make your life easier and the experience of using the Internet a breeze. Good luck and happy surfing!

Giant chain businesses have huge online audiences and can afford the expense of extensive paid advertising and marketing through multiple online venues. Their strategies are intimidating, and online marketing can seem difficult and expensive. Local businesses, though, should also practice online marketing. Using strategies specifically targeted towards localized marketing online, even small local businesses can usually afford to enhance their reputation and increase their success via the internet. Use these 7 online marketing strategies for local businesses to leverage the internet for your business’ benefit: 1. Establish an Online Presence One of the first questions many business owners ask about getting started with online marketing is where to begin. Generally, Google has listings of addresses and sometimes even names of local businesses. From there, business owners have the option to establish a presence via their own website, in online directories, on social media pages, through retail sites, and even on review sites. The answer to which of these venues local businesses should market through? As many as possible. To rank well in search engines, your business should be listed in multiple places online and multiple times in those places. Basically, the more established the business’ online presence is, the easier it is for consumers to encounter the business and the easier it is for consumers to find or stumble across the business through a search engine. 2. Create a Clear and Modern Website The importance of having a helpful, modern, up-to-date website is too often overlooked. As increasing numbers of consumers turn to information on the internet to make decisions about where to give their business, an old or confusing website becomes a death sentence. Potential consumers are likely to check businesses out online before doing business with them, even if they’ve seen the storefront or have visited the business previously. Consumers often check business hours, contact info, prices, and more via the internet as well. If they have difficulty identifying such basic information or find it on a website that looks outdated and poorly managed, they are likely to get the same impression of the business, believing the local business is as outdated, difficult, or poorly managed as the website. In other words, ditch the poor website designs if you want to see an increase in your success with online marketing. 3. Incorporate SEO Into Everything Ensuring that a local business does not get lost in the plethora of information found online is possible largely through the use of search engine optimization (SEO). A marketing tactic that involves strategically using keywords, geo-tagging, categorizing, and much more, SEO is all about building a reputation online so that search engines will identify your business; it is essential to successful online marketing. If a search engine like Google can find a business’ info, it will be much easier for consumers to find that same info. Some of the best ways to use SEO for a local business include: Focusing on a niche using just a few targeted keywords (e.g. this article’s focus on “online marketing”) Focusing taglines and key phrases on location for localization Publishing unique content on different sites that includes the business’ niche keywords and the business’ name Including keywords in social media content and profiles Connecting with other local businesses that are visible online Local business owners often connect with small marketing firms or freelance marketing experts to ensure their web presence is SEO-friendly. 4. Let Google Help You With Your Online Marketing Strategy Even though most local businesses are already listed somewhere on Google because of Google Maps, it is important to make sure local businesses are verified on Google and have updated, correct information. Google processes about 40,000 search queries each second. By verifying and correcting business information on Google, any of those queries pertaining to your business are more effective. Be sure that Google has: A correct link to your website The correct business hours listed Contact information for consumers to use An accurate address Links to reviews, directories, and other pertinent information about your business found online Establish and verify this information on Google regularly. Additionally, build a Google Plus following to improve rankings and receive easy to find reviews. 5. Try Paid, Targeted Advertising Many of the places where local businesses should have a presence online also offer paid advertising opportunities. For instance, a local business with a page on Facebook can pay a small price to have their own advertisement promoted on Facebook to a targeted local audience. This tactic is useful for reaching local potential customers who may not know about a local business or who may not know a local business is now available to connect with online. Reaching niche audiences through paid social media advertising locally can offer a high return on investment. This is especially the case when advertisements offer sales, coupons, invites to local events, and other actionable opportunities for consumers to engage with a local business in person. 6. Use Free Analytical Tools Many large businesses’ online marketing success has a lot to do with them using analytics information well. Through analytics tools, businesses can identify the best time of day to share information, where their web traffic is generated from, conversion rates, and much more. Fortunately, many local businesses also have access to this sort of information if they know where to look. Social media pages like Twitter or Facebook have analytics tools and data built in. Many websites can have analytics software applied, such as Google Analytics. These tools are either free or offered at low rates. Local businesses ought to access analytics information to optimize their use of the internet for marketing purposes. 7. Demonstrate Your Local Pride Some aspects of online marketing really are this simple. Connectedness in the community helps local businesses gain free advertising and is a great way to market online. When local businesses share local news stories and talk about their participation in local events or issues online, for instance, they can rank better in search engines and are likely to reach a wider local audience. Something as simple as sharing a local news story with a basic comment on the issue described in the story can be engaging and spread far online. Get An Awesome Life I'm in!

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us More devices become Daydream certified, get Google VR on these devices By John Hoff - January 6, 2017 1 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter As chipsets and processors become more powerful and capable, more and more devices are becoming capable of giving a great virtual reality experience. Particularly, Google’s Daydream VR still has a stringent standards list for a device to be marked as Daydream-capable. Fortunately, four devices are now certified for Daydream VR – the ZTE Axon 7, the new Huawei Mate 9 and Mate 9 Pro, and the recently announced ASUS Zenfone AR. Remember, Daydream VR requires high resolution displays, robust graphics support, and precise sensors for head tracking and other actions. It seems that all of these relatively new phones fit the bill. The “oldest” phone among these, and probably the most affordable as well, is the ZTE Axon 7. It was launched around June 2016, and has a quad-HD 5.5-inch AMOLED display powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 chipset. You can get an Axon 7 at around USD$399. The Huawei Mate 9 and Mate 9 Pro are more recent phones. They have WQHD displays and are powered by Huawei’s in-house flagship chipset, the Kirin 960. Also, Google is accepting the upcoming Huawei VR headset as Daydream-ready, so you can use it in tandem with your Huawei Daydream-ready device. Lastly, the newly announced ASUS Zenfone AR has been turning heads all around. This device will have a 5.7-inch WQHD Super AMOLED display powered by a Snapdragon 821 chipset and a whopping 8GB of RAM. Apart from Daydream VR, this device will also play nice with Google’s Tango AR technology, so you’ll be getting a 2-for-1 treat with the Zenfone AR.

The session lasted almost an hour long, and it was the first time that Pichai was revisiting the campus after passing out 23 years ago. The discussion covered the efforts by Google, Pichai’s time at the institution, and how things are changing in India. Here are the ten most important pointers for transforming India into a major player in the digital economy. Indian startups need to aim higher Pichai noted that startups in India need to think of expanding beyond just India and compete with the entire world. In his interaction with enterpreneurs over many visits to India, Pichai said he noticed world class approaches to building businesses. Pichai said that there is nothing really missing about startups in India, and the Indian startups are among the best in the world. Instead of dominating the Indian market, startups should be thinking of going international. Sachin Bansal of Flipkart and Bhavish Aggrawal  of Ola have started a lobby group to give Indian startups an edge within India. Indian startups should target similar markets to scale and grow A problem with startups in India is that in a country of 1.3 billion people, only 300 million people are on smartphones, and that too, not all of the 300 million have great connectivity. It is still a sizable market, but the scope for scaling and growing in India is less. Pichai suggests that Indian startups should explore introducing the same products in other similar markets that are at the same state of development. Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam were some of the suggested startup markets. Google has introduced many products starting in India, and later on rolled them out worldwide. YouTube Go, an app that allows users to play and share videos offline without an internet connection, is one such expected product. YouTube Go was built from the group up specifically for India, but is expected to land in other similar markets as well. YouTube Go introduced in September Education needs to focus on real world experiences Pichai appreciated the strong foundation for education in India. However, Pichai noted that the education should evolve with the times. There is a lot of focus on academics, but not as much focus on itnerships, real world projects, and actual experiences. In US colleges, students pick their majors only in their final years. Instead of deciding a stream, and perhaps even a job and a company at the point of completing education, Pichai stressed on the importance of taking time to do things, and explore various avenues to figure out what it is that a person likes doing, and what that person is good at. Love what you are doing A point made repeatedly, Pichai noted that enjoying his work was a big part of his success. When a student asked how to make the most out of his four years at IIT, Pichai advised him not to overthink it, and to take the time to figure out what kind of activities excited him. It is important to explore different things to find out what a person is passionate about. Pichai advised taking the time and effort in getting deeply involved with projects, and understanding them at a deeper level. Finding the right pace is one of the key ingredients of success. Pichai noted how there was a set path for Indian students, from school to IIT to IIM. Pichai found it outrageous that students start preparing for IIT from the 8th standard itself.

Make technology for rural India in local languages An important part of bridging the digital divide in India is to make more technology available in local and regional languages. Google itself is increasingly adding support for more local languages, and has created the ambitions Noto font that is an effort to create a uniform typeface for all the 800 languages in the Unicode standard. Google search hopes to be available in as many Indian languages as possible, and Android is also increasing the number of languages it supports. Pichai went on to say that Google was even looking at introducing technology for regional dialects. India celebrates linguistic diversity, but there are very few technology offerings in regional languages. Indus OS, an Android based operating system with in built translation and transliteration support is one of the good efforts in this direction. DataMail has launched email addresses in eight Indian languages. Internet Saathis at Gokulpur It is important to bridge the gender divide Only one in 10 internet users in rural India is a woman. It is important to boost adoption and use of the latest technologies by women, especially in rural India. Google, along with Tata Trusts has started the Internet Saathi program, to provide digital literacy to rural Indian women. The program empowers the local community by training women on the use of technologies, who then pass on the learnings to other women in their area. Since its launch in 2015, nine states in India have been covered by the program. The program shows directly to rural Indian women, how they stand to benefit by using the internet and other technologies. Android One Canvas A1 by Micromax India needs cheaper smartphones The entry level smartphones are still too expensive according to Pichai. The need of the hour is to provide more people with smart devices, and Pichai wants to see a basic smartphone in the range of $30 (roughly Rs 2000). In India, most of the smartphones sold are in the low end segment, and priced around Rs 5,000. The Android One program launched by Google aims to make affordable smartphones that still provide a uniform user experience. The program is meant especially for developing economies such as India, and has resulted in a few phones from Micromax, Karbonn and Spice, priced at around Rs 6000. Compete with the world, not just China A student asked Pichai if India would ever catch up to China in terms of technology. Pichai replied that he thought the aim for India should be a little different than just competing with China. Pichai went on to say that he was fully confident that India would be one of the major players in the digital economy worldwide, and be competitive with any country in the world. The foundations necessary for such a transformation are there in the country, and it is just a matter of time according to Pichai. Pichai encouraged startups and entrepreneurs in India to continue to do what they were doing, and that India would be “there” in a few years. The Digital Unlocked event Bring more small and medium businesses online Pichai noted that it was important to bring small and medium sized businesses into the digital world. There are about 51 million SMBs in India out of which 68 percent are still not online. Towards this end, a few days before interacting with the IIT-KGP students, Pichai had unveiled the Digital Unlocked mission. The initiative will allow small businesses to increase their reach, even to a global level beyond India. The program will train SMBs with essential digital skills. The “My Business” platform, which Google recently introduced to Rajasthan, allows SMB owners to directly update information about their businesses, including phone numbers and addresses into Google products such as search and maps. Image from RailTel’s launch of Wi-Fi zone at Mumbai Central station Public-Private partnerships need to be encouraged Pichai noted how the regulations in India allowed for easy public-private partnerships, something that was not possible in a lot of other countries. Such kind of partnerships could go a long way for the Make in India program. Google’s partnership with Railtel has allowed it to deploy free high speed wi-fi connectivity in railway stations across the country. The free wi-fi services are being used by over 2 million people in India. The interaction showed that Pichai had a very encouraging outlook for India, especially going forward. “India is a great place to be looking ahead in the next 20 years,” he said.

They're the latest Chromebooks that also run Android apps Since Google announced plans to make its Chromebooks compatible with Android apps last May, dozens of Chrome-powered laptops from companies like Acer, Asus, and Samsung have started running them. Now that selection is getting a little larger, as Samsung on Wednesday announced two new Chromebooks that will be able to run the same apps as any Android smartphone. Samsung’s Chromebook Plus and Chromebook Pro will also include a touchscreen that can rotate 360 degrees, effectively turning it into a tablet. This flexibility, combined with their ability to run Android apps, allow them to simulate the experience of using an Android tablet. Still, users should bear in mind that the version of the Google Play Store preinstalled on these Chromebooks is still in beta. Both notebooks will also come with a stylus that can be used to highlight content or jot down notes, among other tasks. Samsung is also playing up the stylus’ compatibility with its ArtCanvas program for sketching and Google Keep for note-taking. Samsung has emphasized similar functionality on its line of large-screened Galaxy Note smartphones in the past, which come with Samsung’s S-Pen for accessing shortcuts and scribbling reminders on screen. The new Chromebooks will both feature a 12.3-inch 2,400×1,600 resolution display, which is notably sharper than that of most rivals. The Pro model will run on one of Intel’s Core m3 processors and is launching this spring for a yet-unstated price, while the Chromebook Plus is powered by an ARM processor and is coming in February for $449. The Pro and Plus will each come with two USB-C ports, 4GB of RAM, and 32GB of storage space. The $449 starting price puts Samsung’s Chromebooks at the higher end of the market. Other models that include touchscreens, support Android apps, and feature flexible designs, like the Asus Chromebook Flip, cost as little as $249. Samsung’s announcement comes after the Pro model leaked through online retailer listings in October. Tap to read full story Read Next Your browser is out of date.

According to Google, out of the total Internet population in India, about 70 percent are men while 30 percent are women, which is quite big. When we move to rural India, the situation gets worse as out of 10 people who have access to the Internet, only one is a woman. Some of the reasons include family pressure and lack of interest or knowledge. Under the program, Google trains and educates women on how to use devices like smartphones and tablets thereby making them understand what the Internet is, how to use it and all about its potential. These women then go to their villages and educate other women. They get access to information around healthcare, better farming techniques, cooking, entertainment, and more. As of today about 60,000 villages in India now come under the Internet Saathi program and it aims to reach 3 lakh in couple of more years. Last year in June, the program was launched in villages of West Bengal, with the most recent one being Gokulpur located near Kharagpur. I got a chance to visit the remote village and speak to a few ‘Internet Saathis’. Smriti Lekha, a local resident of the village, became an Internet Saathi last December. She told me how happy she was getting the training and how she uses her smartphone to watch news and videos. While she is still new to the program, she understood most of the terminology and her way around smart devices. When asked about any difficulties faced while getting access to the internet, she mentioned that the network is not very stable and most of the times she only manages to get 2G connectivity. Having the opportunity to use a tablet and a smartphone, Moushmi told me that she has been given training from Google and has been assigned four villages in the area. She regularly visits the women in those villages to teach them the basics of using a smartphone. Working for women welfare and child development, she has been spreading awareness around health and social and economical barriers. Just like Smriti, she told me that apart from connectivity, she hasn’t faced any issues during her 15 days of becoming an Internet Saathi. The inititative is certainly making a presence. However, the rate is slow and will pick up pace in time. Of course, having a stable connection is important, but familiarising and making the rural population comfortable with hardware and the internet is a larger task that needs to be accomplished.

Google has been trying to position the vast network of smartphones running its Android operating system for virtual and augmented reality, known as VR and AR, fields that many in the technology industry say are poised to go mainstream after years of niche appeal. Chinese manufacturer Huawei   announced on Thursday that two of its phones will soon work with Daydream View, a VR headset released last year by Google. Meanwhile, Taiwanese manufacturer AsusTek Computer Inc announced that its ZenFone AR will support both Daydream and Google's Tango software for AR, in which computer-generated content is overlaid on the real world. While the announcements expand the line-up of participating phones, Google still has much to do to take its technology to the masses, said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research, noting that Samsung Electronics Co, the largest Android manufacturer, has yet to sign on. "Google's ecosystem for both AR and VR is in the very early days," he said. As growth in the global smartphone market shows signs of slowing, some manufacturers are voicing optimism that AR and VR will revive consumer enthusiasm. "This is the next wave of technology that is really going to get consumers excited about smartphones," Erik Hermanson, Asus's head of marketing for mobile products, said at the show. But mainstream consumer interest in the technology remains largely unproven. Apps might be expected to stimulate demand, but until Google's technology is available on a wider range of phones, it will be tough to persuade developers to build for the platform, analysts said. "We are waiting for app developers to really use the platform for what it's for," Amit Singh, a vice president for VR at Google, told reporters. In addition to supporting Daydream, Huawei said that it is exploring opportunities for Tango with Google. The Asus phone became the first to support both technologies. Google has stressed that the programs do not overlap for now, but by pursuing both, the company can position itself for success regardless of whether AR or VR becomes a mainstream hit. "By having options for both, they can cover the full potential market," said analyst Bob O'Donnell of TECHnalysis Research. © Thomson Reuters 2016 Tags: Google, Tango, CES, CES 2017, Virtual Reality, VR, Augmented Reality, AR, Daydream View, Daydream VR, Wearables, Gaming, Home Entertainment, Apps, Android CES 2017: Intel Introduces Credit Card-Sized 'Compute Card' for Upgradable Smart Gadgets Shenmue HD Domain Registered By Sega; Shenmue Remasters on the Way?

The successor to the "world's most powerful streamer" adds expanded support for 4K HDR, as well as Google Assistant. Image: Christina Warren/Gizmodo Over the last year, we've seen 4K come to a number of streaming boxes — think the Roku Ultra and the Chromecast Ultra — but those only stream 4K content. The new Nvidia Shield supports 4K for video and games. And its HDR support is notable because it will work with Netflix, Google Play and Amazon Video. But the real distinguishing feature between the new Shield and last year's model is the inclusion of support for Google Assistant. Google Assistant is Google's answer to Siri and Amazon Alexa. So far, we've seen Google Assistant on the Google Pixel smartphone and the Google Home speaker, but we haven't seen third-parties get access to the technology. Part of what has given Amazon such a big lead with Alexa are the number of third-party devices with Alexa baked in, so it's good to see Google proactively licensing its tech to its partners. Nvidia will also sell a little microphone/speaker that sticks to your wall called the Nvidia Spot to expand its Google Assistant support. Think of it as like a miniature Amazon Alexa. You can have multiple Spots in your house and they connect to your Shield to process the assistance commands. The new Nvidia Shield will sell for $US199 ($271) — the same price as the existing Shield — when it becomes available later this month. We're on the ground at CES 2017 in Las Vegas!

Google CEO Sundar Pichai, who was conferred with the Distinguished Alumnus Award by IIT Kharagpur in 2015, was finally able to receive the award in person at his alma mater, nearly two years later, on Thursday. “Sundar Pichai was conferred his Distinguished Alumnus Award in the Board Room of IIT Kharagpur on January 5, 2017. The award was given to him at the 2015 convocation but he was unable to come and receive it in person at that time,” IIT Director PP Chakrabarti said in a Facebook post late Thursday. Pichai was back in the campus after 23 years to interact with students. He visited his old hostel Nehru Hall, went to his old room, common room, mess, library, and refreshed his memories, Chakrabarti said. In a heart-to-heart conversation at his alma mater IIT-Kharagpur on Thursday, Sundar Pichai talked about various things in his college life, ranging from his girlfriend, bunking classes to mess food. He visited the campus after 23 years, when he addressed a town hall packed with students.

She lived in…think you still have S.N. Hall, that was the only girls’ hostel then. I hope there are a few more now. It wasn’t very easy. If you had to get someone at the girls hostel, you had to walk in the front and request someone there to go call them. And so they would go and loudly say, “Anjali, Sundar is here for you”. So it wasn’t exactly a pleasant experience.” When talking about his Hindi Sundar recounted, “I came from the Chennai. I learnt Hindi in school but never spoke it much. Just listening to how people were speaking, I just thought you address people this way. One day there was someone in the mess and I had to call him. I called him “Abey saale!” In my first couple of weeks, I thought you call people that way.” Pichai also announced the Digital Unlocked programme for SMEs in India during his India visit. Google’s new initiative will help businesses in India go online.

With this integration in place, the activities recorded by your Android phone or iPhone will be used to mark users' goals as 'Done' automatically by Google Calendar app. The search giant introduced the Goals feature last year to its Calendar app with the aim of helping people find time for their desired activities. However, before this update, users were required to manually mark their goals as done every time they completed an activity. With the latest update, that has now changed. Further, "With this integration, future goal times will be even more tailored based on when you're most likely to complete them," Google said in its blog post. In case you have set a goal to go for a run every day at 6:30 in the morning but are not able to do it till 7:00, the Calendar app with adjust accordingly and "help you find the best time" for your activities, Google said. Even though the update has already popped up at the App Store, the Android update is expected to roll out soon as well. Google introduced the Goals API to the Google Fit app on Android back in October last year to enable it to read goals set by the user.

Gap Inc. certainly hopes so—but it may take awhile January 6, 2017 | Advertising & Marketing | Retail & Ecommerce | Media & Entertainment Share Email Print Google is partnering with Gap Inc. to let shoppers try on clothes “virtually“ at home via augmented reality. While the concept isn’t new, AR is becoming familiar enough to consumers that it can start to affect sales. Powered by the Google Tango’s AR platform, The DressingRoom app is fairly straightforward. Shoppers first choose a Gap item they want to try on, select their size and then a 3-D virtual mannequin pops up modeling that item. “Consumers, and particularly younger consumers, want an engaging experience when they shop,” said eMarketer analyst Yory Wurmser. “They like personalization, and they like self-service online features that answer some of the questions that in the past could only be answered by a sales associate or by handling the product. Any digital technology that makes the physical product more palpable, is easy to use and serves a common customer need can help drive online sales.” There are kinks to work out. Even though the app is currently in beta (it’s expected to be released later this month) Tango’s AR platform has some limitations. For one, shoppers aren't seeing how the clothes look on themselves, but rather a virtual mannequin, which approximates their size. Instead of putting in their own measurements, shoppers choose from five body types, ranging from extra small to extra-large. The app is also only available on a limited number of phones that support Google’s Tango AR technology. Specifically, Lenovo’s Phab2 Pro and Asus’ ZenFone AR. Google plans to have the technology implemented across all mobile devices, Bloomberg reported. But when that will happen is unknown. Wurmser said there is a hardware challenge, since Tango ”requires some pretty heavy processing and hardware requirements, which few phones currently have. So it may take a while for the hardware to match the software capabilities.” AR is definitely not a fad, but it may not be completely ready for primetime. Generally, the magic mirror technology employed by Ikea—in which a mirror displays a compliment to shoppers as they pass by—is relatively easy, as is tech that places an inanimate object in a real space. ”The stuff that Gap is trying is much harder,” Wurmser said. “If it looks clunky, it won't serve the consumer desire to understand the product better.” Nevertheless, shoppers are eager to experience the technology. And, they are far more aware of AR following the widespread use of Pokémon Go. While this awareness is heavily skewed toward younger consumers, consumers of all ages are becoming accustomed to AR in retail. Sephora has had success with its augmented reality mirror that lets shoppers virtually try on makeup via its app. IKEA and Wayfair have made inroads, too, by implementing the technology to show shoppers how furniture can look in their home. According to data from AYTM Market Research, nearly a third of US internet users surveyed were aware of AR. A separate study by Interactions, a global retail event marketing company, found that six in 10 US internet users would shop for furniture via AR and almost as many would shop for clothing. —Rimma Kats New in eMarketer PRO This Week Forecast: US Wearables Users, 2016-2020, with Breakouts by Age, Gender and Generation Report: US Digital Ad Spending Benchmarks by Industry, H2 Update Statpack: Canada – Consumer Time and Advertiser Dollars Report: UK Digital Trends for 2017 Not a PRO subscriber?

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 6 January 2017 | MYT 1:42 PM CES 2017: Baidu family robot a Chinese spin on Amazon Echo Giving a face to AI assistants: An employee showing off the “Little Fish” home assistant unit at the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Unlike “faceless” Amazon Alexa or Google Home devices that rely solely on speech commands, Little Fish also features a touchscreen on top of its orb-shaped base. — AFP LAS VEGAS: Chinese Internet colossus Baidu is out to make a splash with ‘Little Fish,’ a family robot that is a voice-controlled virtual valet akin to Amazon Echo or Google Home.  Baidu showed off “Little Fish,” a translation of its Chinese name “Xiaoyu Zaijia,” on Jan 5 at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas ahead of its release in China later this year.  ”I think 2017 will be the year of conversational computing,” Baidu chief scientist Andrew Ng said while demonstrating Little Fish for AFP behind closed doors at the show.  ”We see a clear path of conversational computers changing everything.”  Using voice to interact with computers that are able to essentially learn from experience was among the hot trends at CES. Arrays of device makers added digital aide capabilities with the help of Amazon’s Alexa or Google Assistant technology.  Unlike “faceless” Amazon Alexa or Google Home devices that rely on people asking for information or controlling devices by speaking, Little Fish also features a touch-screen on top of its orb-shaped base. Little Fish uses Baidu’s operating system DuerOS, which is already employed by other devices in China, such as set-top TV boxes that can switch channels by voice command or figure out names of actors on screen when asked. — AFP A camera on top tracks faces, and the screen swivels to keep facing a speaker.  ”Speech is the fastest way for you to communicate with a computer, but a screen is a very fast way for a machine to communicate back to you,” Ng said.  For example, it would be quicker to glance at a requested list of top restaurants from Yelp than it would be to listen to the computer read all the names and descriptions, he said.   Transformative  Little Fish uses Baidu’s operating system DuerOS, which is already employed by other devices in China, such as set-top TV boxes that can switch channels by voice command or figure out names of actors on screen when asked.  The bigger vision is to build DuerOS into a broad range of gadgets that tap into Baidu’s Internet capabilities for search, food delivery, online commerce and more.  ”If this takes off, I am not worried about how we will make money,” Ng said when asked about revenue plans.  ”It will transform how you use devices in your home. There are plenty of business models.”  Little Fish, a second-generation device, will be released in China at a price yet to be disclosed, according to Baidu.  Baidu partnered with hardware firm Ainemo to build it.  ”We believe family robots will be the next big category that will be a member of everybody’s home,” Ainemo chief executive and founder Chenfeng Song said in a release.   AI taking hold  Artificial intelligence, or AI, is getting a foothold in homes, with developers feverishly adding “skills” to Amazon Echo speakers infused with Alexa.  Google, meanwhile, is using its AI prowess in Android smartphones, messaging software, and a vase-sized Home digital assistant.  The home hubs, sometimes referred to as smart speakers, fetch content or answers from the internet, and can act as remote controls for other devices in houses.  ”We are moving technologies beyond the smartphone,” said Shawn DuBravac, chief economist at the Consumer Technology Association (CTA) that organizes CES.  ”Ultimately, vocal computing is replacing the (screen).”  Chinese tech giant Huawei said at CES that it is adding Amazon’s Alexa to its flagship smartphone for its US launch.  China-based Lenovo announced it was launching a smart home assistant powered by Alexa, joining the growing roster of contenders in the market for voice-activated devices.  ”In the smart home, voice is clearly important,” DuBravac said.  ”We are seeing that play out at CES.”  He expected voice technology to quickly improve, within years perhaps even being able to recognize speakers so accurately it could be used for biometric security, or simple parental override of internet use by offspring.  ”I know that in my home with my boys, I would like Alexa to recognize my voice as the ruler of the coop,” DuBravac quipped.  While digital assistant technology is being built into televisions, appliances and more, hub devices such as Alexa will be key to voice-controlled computing, according to the economist.  NPD analyst Ben Arnold said at CES that he is “bullish on everything voice and AI,” with the technologies eventually “pollenating” devices so thoroughly they essentially become home operating systems. — AFP You May Be Interested Boosting women's libido Glass discards now included in waste separation law Better rates via online forex services Paying high interest rates for personal loans Purple should be your favourite CNY colour Chinese herb Dang Shen helps to boost strength Others Also Read Lebanese Ghaddar re-signs for third spell with Kelantan Glamorous nights with nature Do we really need to fear China money? advertisement Latest News Sci-fi tech set for 2017 QLED vs OLED PCs on the rise Startup pays real people to answer questions to build better AI Dell Vostro 14: Value for money Most Viewed in Tech PCs on the rise Dell Vostro 14: Value for money Could your gadgets send you to jail?

Google has been trying to position the vast network of smartphones running its Android operating system for virtual and augmented reality, known as VR and AR, fields that many in the technology industry say are poised to go mainstream after years of niche appeal. Chinese manufacturer Huawei Technologies Co announced on Thursday that two of its phones will soon work with Daydream View, a VR headset released last year by Google. Meanwhile, Taiwanese manufacturer AsusTek Computer Inc announced that its ZenFone AR will support both Daydream and Google’s Tango software for AR, in which computer-generated content is overlaid on the real world. While the announcements expand the line-up of participating phones, Google still has much to do to take its technology to the masses, said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research, noting that Samsung Electronics Co, the largest Android manufacturer, has yet to sign on. “Google’s ecosystem for both AR and VR is in the very early days,” he said. As growth in the global smartphone market shows signs of slowing, some manufacturers are voicing optimism that AR and VR will revive consumer enthusiasm. “This is the next wave of technology that is really going to get consumers excited about smartphones,” Erik Hermanson, Asus’s head of marketing for mobile products, said at the show. But mainstream consumer interest in the technology remains largely unproven. Apps might be expected to stimulate demand, but until Google’s technology is available on a wider range of phones, it will be tough to persuade developers to build for the platform, analysts said. “We are waiting for app developers to really use the platform for what it’s for,” Amit Singh, a vice president for VR at Google, told reporters. In addition to supporting Daydream, Huawei said that it is exploring opportunities for Tango with Google. The Asus phone became the first to support both technologies. Google has stressed that the programs do not overlap for now, but by pursuing both, the company can position itself for success regardless of whether AR or VR becomes a mainstream hit. “By having options for both, they can cover the full potential market,” said analyst Bob O’Donnell of TECHnalysis Research.

In fact, it does not have to be the other side, it just has to be the person standing next to you. We all have this unchangeable habit that has grown into common mentality, which taunts us about what your friend or colleague has that’s often better. Whether it’s the smartphone you’re holding, or the degree you’ve earned, the job and designation that’s on your resume, we simply love to compare and then keep pondering over, what ifs? At the Google Back on Campus event held at IIT-Kharagpur, it was Google CEO, Sundar Pichai who stole the show at his alma mater. He reminisced, got nostalgic, and even gave students a good idea about what Google is focussing on next – machine learning. But there was a particular theme, one which Pichai became a part of and at times even opened up about. But Google’s Vice President, South East Asia and India, Rajan Anandan said it like nobody else, “… I hope that none of you have to leave India”. It was an inspiring talk like nothing else, bold statements made that will surely inspire the thousands of IITians at Kharagpur sitting in the hot sun, questioning their existence, fearing whether the person sitting next to them is better than him or her. And this one statement by Rajan Anandan surely had a bigger impact and acted as a good reminder that you don’t need to leave home anymore, because India is moving ahead and everything from Apple to Google and in between, is already vying to be out here! And there’s plenty of evidence that there’s no need to go abroad to study, seek guidance and ponder over the next best idea, the next big thing. Anandan began with simple examples before he made his big statement. He (later Pichai) hinted how the top performing engineers at Google come from IITs. Later on at the event, Google CEO Sundar Pichai became a shining example of just that. In fact, he went on to say that IIT KGPs and PHDs are working on a number of world class research projects, some which also include the next big thing, machine learning. He shouted out stating that “… I hope that none of you have to leave India, that all of you stay in India and all of you innovate for India.” The challenges already exist and it’s time everyone took advantage of them seeking opportunities to innovate. The recent demonetisation move turned out to be good example where multiple startups made leeways around the cash crunch to help India sail its way through the doldrums of what was and still is a cash-friendly economy. Image Credit: Google Soon enough Sundar Pichai took to the stage and answered similar queries coming directly from the students of IIT KGP. He was also surprised to know how students who have just joined IITs are already looking at IIMs without any exploration, without any real world experience. Pichai then hinted at the Indian startups space, another area loaded with opportunity, to look broader and think bigger than just limiting their ideas and innovation to the country. There was also a small hint at the unchanged Indian mentality towards education with involved spending time with books and following set structures without exploration. It points to the cracks in the Indian education system, one that has yet to evolve into a more practical approach that has surprisingly got plenty of people places this far. So what if this changes, what if we have that broader thinking? What if students don’t ever have to leave India? Just may be, that grass on the other side will not matter anymore (forget being better or worse). Heck if the world’s largest internet company believes that there’s a ton of potential in India, who are we to argue?

Here's what Sundar Pichai said By Zee Media Bureau | Last Updated: Friday, January 6, 2017 - 10:30 0 Shares Facebook Twitter Whatsapp  Comment Follow @ZeeNews New Delhi: It was an emotional reunion for Google CEO Sundar Pichai at IIT Kharagpur campus, as he returned to his alma mater after a long gap of 23 years. This was his first visit to the campus after he completed his B.Tech in 1993. However, soon, the conversation with students became more fun-filled.  In a heart-to-heart conversation with IIT-Kharagpur students Pichai talked about various things in his college life, ranging from his girlfriend, bunking classes, India's prospects in the technology world, getting a job in Google to mess food. Pichai recounted that he was interviewed at Google on April 1, 2004. It was the same day that the company launched Gmail. Pichai said that he thought Gmail as an April Fool's prank. But, after a bouts of interview sessions, he realised that Gmail was a real thing. The pun-side of Pichai came out while he said that he was one of the first employees at Google not to be interviewed by (Google co-founder) Larry Page. He said he always tells people that's why he got the job. Another mathematics student, whose core subject was not computer science, asked Sundar Pichai how to get a job in Google. The interview moderator asked stuedents to raise their hands if they wanted to work with Google –most of the hands went up. To this Pichai funnily said, “ May be we should open a campus in Kharagpur.” Pichai told him not to worry, “ It's easier to train a good mathematician the coding parts, than to do it the other way round.” “I actually think that you are on a good path. Keep doing that!,” Pichai quipped.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai, who was conferred with the Distinguished Alumnus Award by IIT Kharagpur in 2015, was finally able to receive the award in person at his alma mater, nearly two years later. "Sundar Pichai was conferred his Distinguished Alumnus Award in the Board Room of IIT Kharagpur on January 5, 2017.

The Latest New Products Must-See Join CNET Member Benefits Sign In to CNET My Profile Forums Sign Out Australia China France Germany Japan Korea United Kingdom US Editions English Español CNET Home Entertainment Media Streamers Nvidia Shield TV (2017) Nvidia Shield powers up with Amazon, Google Home and improved gaming (hands-on) 6 January 2017, 12:20 pm AEDT Close Drag 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 CNET's best-reviewed streaming devices are made by Roku, but the more-expensive Nvidia Shield has always been more than just another box that serves up Netflix. The newest version, available for preorder today and shipping later this month, could broaden its appeal beyond tech nerds and Kodi/Plex fans. Welcome improvements include more apps, new smart home capabilities from Google Assistant and a better game controller. And now there's even a remote in the box. Pricing hasn't changed though: the basic Shield with 16GB of onboard storage is $200 and the Shield Pro with 500GB storage is $300. I got a full hands-on demo of the new device and software today. Here's what I learned. Sarah Tew/CNET App upgrades: Amazon Video and 360 YouTube One of my biggest complaints about Shield has finally been addressed: there's now an app for Amazon video. It's the latest interface, just like the one found on Roku's new 4K boxes and many Smart TVs, and offers full access to Amazon's vast library of content, including Prime video, a la carte movies and TV shows, and 4K and HDR content (when connected to a compatible TV). Now the sole major streaming platform that doesn't have Amazon -- the second-most popular service after Netflix -- is Apple TV. The Shield YouTube app will now work with 360 video. While other devices will also handle YouTube's 360 video, which lets you pan around to get different views of the action, Shield's game controller makes it more natural. I found it much easier to scan around using its thumbsticks than it would be using a standard remote controller. Since it launched Shield has added just about every other major app, it often gets the latest and best interfaces, and of course you can cast compatible apps from your phone. Netflix and Amazon offer 4K and HDR at launch, while Google Play Movies and TV and Vudu will have 4K. Nvidia reps told me that when Vudu launches HDR10 support (expected later this year) the Shield will also support its HDR. Shield doesn't handle Dolby Vision, however. Sarah Tew/CNET Smaller box and controller, better gaming The new Shield box has the exact same powerful processing and graphics as the original but is 40 percent smaller. It has all of the same connections (HDMI, two USB) except there's no longer an SD card slot. If you want extra storage you'll have to use USB or a NAS, or buy the 500GB Pro model. Owners of the base 16GB model can also format a USB 3.0 drive to increase internal storage. On the original Shield the remote control was a $50 option, used a rechargeable battery, and lacked infrared so it couldn't control TV volume directly. The updated one can; it relies on a coin cell battery that lasts a year, and best of all, is now included in the box along with the game controller. 42 Nvidia Shield adds Amazon, Google Assistant, tons of games (hands-on) I complained about the original controller's bulky size, but the new one is much better. It's smaller and lighter and feels much closer to PS4 or Xbox One-grade. The grips are cobwebbed with futuristic angles, it now has haptic feedback, and Nvidia claims a 60-hour battery life between charges. Nvidia has upgraded to Pascal servers for its GeForce Now game streaming service, enabling better graphics and less lag, and enabled syncing and cloud saves. It also revamped the GameStream system that lets Nvidia-equipped PC owners play on the big screen (and even in HDR for select games), added an app that links directly to Steam's Big Picture mode, and consolidated all games (including Google Play) into one interface. Sarah Tew/CNET OK Google, turn down the lights and control my TV Later this year the Shield will get a software upgrade that enables Google Assistant, the always-listening Amazon Alexa competitor that debuted on the Google Home speaker. Unlike Alexa on the Fire TV stick or Siri on the Apple TV, which require you to push a button and talk into the remote's mic to get a response, Google Assistant on Nvidia Shield relies on a far-field mic built into the game controller. It's always on and always listening for the "Hello Google" awake phrase. 50 All the cool new gadgets at CES 2017 Nvidia's demo worked like a charm. After the rep said "Hello Google, start my day" with the controller a few feet away on a nearby table, the system sprang into action, adjusting the Nest thermostat and starting the coffee-maker. Voice commands also caused searches for TV shows and movies, launched apps like Netflix and even played shows like directly -- all without having to speak into the remote. If you don't want the Google listening all the time, you can disable the feature in the main menu. Shield can control all of the Smart Home devices Google Home can, and even works as a full SmartThings hub if you plug in the $30 SmartThings USB dongle (coming later this year). Also available later this year will be the $50 Nvidia Spot, a far-field mic/speaker that plugs into a power outlet on the wall and extends Shield's listening range. Sarah Tew/CNET We'll have a full review of the new Shield at CNET soon, but it's already one of the most powerful all-in-one TV boxes you can buy, and it just keeps getting better. PS: If you happen to own an existing Shield, rejoice. With the exception of the always-on mic and new remote, all of the upgrades described above will come via a software update that'll be available the same day the new Shield ships (around January 16).

Nexus 6 Starts Receiving Android 7.1.1 Nougat Update, Factory Image Up for Grabs GO It should take a couple of days to arrive on all devices Jan 6, 2017 05:59 GMT  ·  By Andrei Vlad  ·  Share:  We've heard rumors about the Android 7.1.1 Nougat update coming to the Nexus 6 in early January, and it looks like Google has delivered on previous reports. The update is now being pushed to all Nexus 6 devices all over the world in a staged manner. If you own the Nexus 6 and have been waiting patiently for Android 7.1.1 Nougat to arrive on your phone, then you should start checking for the update. Keep in mind, though, that it will take a couple of days for the update to propagate to all Nexus 6 units. However, if you don't want to wait any longer, you can download the factory image and flash it on your smartphone. It's also worth mentioning that Google released the OTA files as well, so you have many options at your disposal to upgrade your Nexus 6 to Android 7.1.1 Nougat. Android 7.1.1 Nougat might not be the last update the Nexus 6 receives this year, but we doubt the smartphone will get another major OS update since it's older than two years. Google does not update Nexus and Pixel devices older than 18 months to new versions of Android unless there's a good reason for that. The Nexus 6 might have been an exception, as the phone was launched back in November 2016. Nexus 6 Other Nexus devices still supported by Google have already received Android 7.1.1 Nougat updates, including the Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, and the Pixel C tablet. However, Google has found a last-minute bug and couldn't provide the same update to Nexus 6 phones at the time Android 7.1.1 Nougat was rolled out to other Nexus and Pixel devices. Android 7.1.1 Nougat brings a couple of new features that were exclusive to Pixel smartphones, like fingerprint gestures. The update also adds a couple more emoji and GIF support, which will allow users to send this type of images directly from the keyboard. App shortcuts is another new feature included in Android 7.1.1 Nougat, so you will now be able to launch actions on your most often used apps, including Twitter and Google Maps, by simply long pressing the app icon.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (2 Images) #Nexus 6#Android 7.1.1 Nougat#Android update#Google update#Nexus 6 update subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Photo Gallery (2 Images) 01 02 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google Releases January Security Patch for Nexus and Pixel Devices Google Confirms Android 7.1.1 Nougat Arrives on Nexus 6 in Early January Google Renames Keyboard App for Android to Gboard, Adds New Features Google Details Android 7.1.1 Nougat's New Features and Improvements It's Now Possible to Use openSUSE Inside Windows 10, Here's How to Install It Barnes & Noble Halts Sales of Nook Tablets Due to Faulty Chargers Android Co-Founder Andy Rubin Working on a Premium Bezel-less Smartphone Lenovo Confirms New Moto Smartphones Will Be Unveiled at MWC 2017 Linus Torvalds Announces Fourth Linux 4.10 Kernel Release Candidate, Get It Now Debian Outs First Release Candidate of Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch" Installer Sony G3112 and G3221 Smartphones Coming Soon with MediaTek Helio P20 CPUs Linux Kernel 4.9.4 Released with Various ARM/ARM64 and Networking Improvements 2 photos    Nexus 6 new android apps imo APK: Updated January 15th, 18:31 GMT AndroDumpper APK: Updated January 15th, 18:29 GMT MCPE Master APK: Updated January 15th, 18:27 GMT SuperSU APK: Updated January 15th, 18:24 GMT Geekbench 4 APK: Updated January 15th, 18:20 GMT Xbox Beta APK: Updated January 15th, 18:17 GMT Action Launcher 3 APK: Updated January 15th, 18:14 GMT Reader comments Galaxy S8 Most Likely Not the Phone in Samsung Display Videos more on: Samsung i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

Google initially announced the new Daydream VR platform back at Google I/O 2016 which was released along with the Pixel and Pixel XL. Fast forward to the latter part of 2016 when the Moto Z lineup was updated with Android Nougat. At that time the Moto Z became the first non-Pixel smartphone to include Daydream. Then ZTE made an announcement confirming the Android Nougat update would include Daydream support. Now, Google has published on its blog the fact that there will be a total of 4 different smartphones which will include Daydream support in the near future. The ASUS ZenFone AR was introduced at CES 2017 and was confirmed to include both Tango and Daydream support. The Huawei Mate 9 Pro and Huawei Mate 9 Porsche Design were both introduced back in 2016, but Google has confirmed these devices will be updated with Daydream support. However, Google did not share the details of when the devices would be able to be used with Daydream. We’ll have to wait until the respective OEMs provide us more information regarding the updates, but it’s great to see Daydream make its way to more and more devices.

The project is part of Google's Internet of Things Technology Research Award to bridge the gap between emerging tec-hnology and emergent users —in this case Dharavi business owners. The award gives researchers access to Google's various technologies for the pilot project. In this case, IIT-B students got access to Google's 'physical web' technology that uses a beacon to connect shops to the physical world to help them promote their business. About 100 BLE (bluetooth low energy) beacons provided by Google will be set in shops for the month-long research project. The beacons can run up to four years after installati-on. A pilot project is being implemented in 30 leather shops. "We work with people who have started using Android phones with internet in the last one or two years. Professors Matt Jones from Swansea and Anirudha Joshi from IDC have been working in the domain of emergent users for quite some time," said Chinmay Parab, a student. "Most new technologies, at inception, are exclusive and cater to only those who can afford it. We asked, 'Can we use technologies that cater to the wealthy for those who really need it?' The Internet of Thin-gs technology will provide people in the resource-constrained environment of Dharavi an exposure to vast possibilities." Convincing shop owners to use the technology was also a task. "Some were hesitant to get new designs photographed. I would visit them every week and convince them to be part of the project. If something subst-antial comes out from the project, the technology can be developed for largescale use," said Parab, adding they are publicizing it using social media.

(Photo: Gareth van Zyl) RELATED ARTICLES PICS: Intel teases new VR headset at CES Here come 'smart stores' with robots, interactive shelves Tech show looks beyond 'smart,' to new 'realities' Las Vegas - Internet search giant Google is looking to boost the reach of its mobile virtual reality offering ‘Daydream’ with the help of Asian phone makers. Daydream-ready phones are built for virtual reality as they come with high-resolution displays, smooth graphics, and high-fidelity sensors for precise head tracking. The Google technology was launched in November last year and, up until this week, the tech was only available for the likes of the Pixel and Moto Z smartphones. READ: PICS - Intel teases new VR headset at CES But amid a greater push in the industry towards VR, Google this week alongside the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas announced more Daydream partnerships. And Asian phone makers have jumped at the technology as China’s Huawei and ZTE, as well as Taiwan’s Asus, are set to carry Daydream on select smartphones. At a Huawei keynote on Thursday, Google’s vice president for business and operations, virtual reality and augmented reality, Amit Singh announced that Daydream will be available on the Mate 9 handset. "Daydream is Google's stake and our new platform for immersive, mobile high-performance virtual reality,” said Singh. "What we found is actually building smartphones for VR is a lot of work. It requires a close partnership deep in the engineering level in designing the optics, display technologies, sensors,” Singh added.

"The Huawei VR headset is built to be easy to use. It has an adjustable focus so it can be used without eyeglasses, and provides a 95° field of view. By bringing new headsets onto the Daydream platform, we hope to give consumers even more choice in how they enjoy VR," he added. Tango with augmented reality At the Huawei keynote on Thursday, Singh further spoke of Google’s augmented reality app Tango. Tango gives phones augmented reality (AR) capabilities via technologies such as motion tracking, depth perception and area learning. The likes of clothing maker Gap has been working on a new Tango enabled app dubbed ‘DressingRoom’, which Google says “takes the guess work out of apparel shopping”. Phones such as the Asus ZenFone AR are set to get the app which will be available on Google Play at the end of January. *Fin24 is attending CES courtesy of Hisense.Read Fin24's top stories trending on Twitter: Fin24’s top stories Read more about: zte  |  asus  |  huawei  |  google  |  las vegas  |  ces  |  ces 2017  |  consumer electronics show share: More In This Category HTC's next smartphone leaked a day ahead of launch Three new iPads expected this year - analyst Samsung smartwatches can now be used with iPhones Nokia launches smarter device after 'dumb phone' release Most Popular Read WhatsApp vulnerable to 'backdoor' spying - report MTN 'gives away' 50GB and 10 000 minutes every month Hail Uber, book restaurants through Google Maps Will Apple's next iPhone be borderless?

IE Home Nation World Opinion Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Technology Viral Photos Videos E-Paper Apps RSS Gadgets Review Photos Videos Mobile & Tabs Science Indian Express Home Home Technology Tech News At CES, Google pushes virtual reality harder with new phones from partners At CES, Google pushes virtual reality harder with new phones from partners Huawei Technologies Co announced on Thursday that two of its phones will soon work with Google's Daydream View By: Reuters | Published:January 6, 2017 10:01 am Amit Singh, vice president of Google business operations virtual reality and augmented reality talks about his company’s VR headset during the Huawei keynote address at CES in Las Vegas (Source: Reuters) Alphabet Inc’s Google quickened the pace of its push into virtual and augmented reality this week as its hardware partners announced new devices featuring the company’s technology at the CES electronics show in Las Vegas. Google has been trying to position the vast network of smartphones running its Android operating system for virtual and augmented reality, known as VR and AR, fields that many in the technology industry say are poised to go mainstream after years of niche appeal. Chinese manufacturer Huawei Technologies Co announced on Thursday that two of its phones will soon work with Daydream View, a VR headset released last year by Google. Meanwhile, Taiwanese manufacturer AsusTek Computer Inc announced that its ZenFone AR will support both Daydream and Google’s Tango software for AR, in which computer-generated content is overlaid on the real world. While the announcements expand the line-up of participating phones, Google still has much to do to take its technology to the masses, said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research, noting that Samsung Electronics Co, the largest Android manufacturer, has yet to sign on. “Google’s ecosystem for both AR and VR is in the very early days,” he said. Also read: Asus Zenfone AR at CES 2017: How this Project Tango smartphone works As growth in the global smartphone market shows signs of slowing, some manufacturers are voicing optimism that AR and VR will revive consumer enthusiasm. “This is the next wave of technology that is really going to get consumers excited about smartphones,” Erik Hermanson, Asus’s head of marketing for mobile products, said at the show. But mainstream consumer interest in the technology remains largely unproven. Apps might be expected to stimulate demand, but until Google’s technology is available on a wider range of phones, it will be tough to persuade developers to build for the platform, analysts said. “We are waiting for app developers to really use the platform for what it’s for,” Amit Singh, a vice president for VR at Google, told reporters. In addition to supporting Daydream, Huawei said that it is exploring opportunities for Tango with Google. The Asus phone became the first to support both technologies. Google has stressed that the programs do not overlap for now, but by pursuing both, the company can position itself for success regardless of whether AR or VR becomes a mainstream hit. “By having options for both, they can cover the full potential market,” said analyst Bob O’Donnell of TECHnalysis Research.

(Google) Share Written by Devjyot Ghoshal January 05, 2017 Quartz india Kharagpur, India On the morning of Jan. 05, some three dozens students stood outside the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Kharagpur’s Nehru Hall of Residence waiting for the homecoming of one of the institute’s most famous sons. After much shuffling and rearrangement of the welcome party, a cavalcade pulled up a little past 11.25am. Only a small, maroon bus came through the gate. A small group slowly disembarked, till a tall bespectacled man, modestly dressed in a blue shirt and black jeans, got off. Applause and hoots followed instantaneously. Finally, Sundar Pichai, the chief executive officer of Google, was back where it all began—for the first time since graduation in 1993. Hostel and security staff crowded around. “Woh daadhi wala hai (It’s the bearded one),” someone whispered, confirming Pichai’s identity. Wide-eyed current residents stood huddled by the corridors as 44-year-old Pichai walked up to B-308, an underwhelmingly ordinary room. It has two chairs, two tables, a bed without a pillow, and a guitar tucked away under the window. Behind the green door, there’s a curious collection of cosmetics, edibles, and electronics piled up on concrete shelves. It could’ve been any hostel room in any Indian college. For Pichai, presumably, it remains something special. So, too, for the young men who now live in Nehru Hall. “It’s a badge of honour for every Nehru-ite,” said Shashank K, 23, a final-year computer science student, “that this was once Sundar’s hostel.” In the ultra-competitive world of inter-hall rivalries at IIT-Kharagpur, the first of India’s elite engineering schools, founded in 1950, bragging rights are serious currency. And few of these halls have alumni that include the likes of Pichai, arguably one of the most powerful technology executives in the world today. “He’s an inspiration,” added Shashank, explaining how Pichai’s journey from the metallurgy department at Kharagpur to Stanford, Wharton, McKinsey, and eventually to the top of Google in 2015, remains exceptional, even by the high standards set by IIT alumni. Kumar Abhishek, another fifth-year student, and current Nehru-ite, had seen Pichai before. Last summer, he interned at Google’s Mountain View headquarters. But this was different. “He’s someone who started his journey here,” said Abhishek, “It’s humbling, it’s a matter of pride.” The same sense of pride percolated through the crowd of some 3,500 students and staff that gathered at the Tagore open-air theatre later in the day. Queues had been winding around the venue from as early as 10am, and comedians Biswa Kalyan Rath and Kanan Gill had to stretch their performance with Pichai running late. But there was no lack of enthusiasm when he finally arrived past noon. There were hoots, applause and whoops as the alumnus strode across the faux grass on the stage and took a seat for a chat with Hitesh Oberoi. The latter is the CEO of Info Edge which owns the likes of naukri.com and 99acres.com, and attended IIT-Delhi around the same time that Pichai was at Kharagpur. Much of the conversation centred around Pichai’s time at Kharagpur. The Google CEO did bunk classes because, as he explained, “it is the rite of passage of going through college.” The Chennai boy once called out to a member of the mess staff using “abey saale (roughly, ‘Hey stupid’),” thinking it was a polite Hindi greeting. He was ragged and was even hit by “CG Change,” where his room was turned upside down despite being locked from outside. CG stands for centre of gravity. He also had to contend with the frequent public announcement of “Anjali, Sundar is here for you,” at Sarojini Naidu Hall, the hostel that housed the classmate who would go on to become his wife. Expectedly, the session also included a smattering of the work underway at Google under Pichai’s watch, particularly artificial intelligence and machine learning, which he reckons will drive the next wave of computing. He also discussed India’s evolving technology ecosystem. “I’m pretty convinced that in the next 5-10 year timeframe,” Pichai predicted, “there would be big global software companies coming out of India.” More than once, the talk turned to education and the ideal career trajectory, to which Pichai had broadly two responses: Follow your passions, and setbacks don’t matter because it’s a long journey. His audience, mostly comprising India’s academic royalty, hung on to every word. Yet, for all his rockstar status, Pichai seemed somewhat reticent—even shy. He was careful in what he revealed—no GPA numbers, nothing on his college shenanigans, or even what posters hung in his room back in the day. His body language, too, showed little outward exhilaration, though he smiled steadily through the day. His former professor, Sanat Kumar Roy, was hardly surprised. “Today I could also very well notice that even though he has been living in the (United) States for two-and-a-half decades, that Indian shyness, that inherent character, is still persisting,” said 72-year-old Roy, now retired. “It’s still there.” Although Pichai was whip-smart as a student, Roy didn’t quite expect him to find his way into the corner office. For one, he wasn’t quite “charismatic” as an undergraduate, unlike, say, the likes of former Vodafone Group chairman Arun Sarin, who was also taught by Roy. Secondly, Pichai was an academic ace. “Normally, toppers are expected to join academics because IIT toppers are academic-minded,” Roy, himself an IIT-Kharagpur graduate, explained. “But Sundar chose a different path and he excelled to the pinnacle of success.” It’s a path that has perhaps made him the first among equals on the hallowed list of IIT-Kharagpur and Nehru Hall alumni, which feature the likes of Arvind Kejriwal, the chief minister of New Delhi. “I don’t know if Arvind comes here, he’ll get the same welcome,” said Shashank, as Pichai’s bus drove out of the gates of Nehru Hall.

TECHNOLOGY Jesse Jackson: Uber Must Release its Diversity Numbers The civil rights leader has given Uber until Feb. 15 to draft a public plan for more diversity in the $60 billion tech company's hiring. By Salvador Rodriguez Salvador Rodriguez is a staff reporter for the San Francisco bureau of Inc.

One of his special skills is the ability to name all the Super Bowl winners chronologically from memory. @sal19 Staff reporter, Inc.@sal19 WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Civil rights activist Rev. Jesse Jackson has found a new focus for his criticism: Uber. On Thursday, Jackson called on the $60 billion private tech company to become more proactive about hiring more women and minorities, starting by releasing a workforce diversity report. Although the tech industry has been slow to ramp up its hiring of people from underrepresented groups, dozens of tech companies have made public commitments to increasing diversity. This includes the likes of Google, Apple, Facebook and others, all of which have released annual workforce reports since 2014. Uber, along with Snap Inc. and Square, is among the biggest remaining tech companies yet to commit to such transparency. So far, it has not put out any diversity numbers. "We urge Uber to 'lean in' and join the ranks of technology companies that are reporting your diversity and inclusion data," Jackson said in a note addressed to Travis Kalanick, Uber's CEO. Specifically, Jackson is calling on Uber to release its hiring numbers since 2014, its official EEO-1 government documents and the diversity of its board of directors, and to publicly detail its plans and policies for diverse hiring. Back in 2015, Jackson had already called on "tech unicorns," an informal term for private tech companies worth more than $1 billion, to release their diversity numbers, but now he is shining the spotlight directly on Uber. "I look forward to receiving Uber's data, and more importantly, meeting with your top leadership at the earliest convenience on the issues outlined in this communication," Jackson said. Jackson, who has fought for civil rights for more than half a century, has been among the key leaders in the diversity efforts within the tech industry, purchasing stock at key companies in order to push them to become more transparent and active with their diversity efforts. More broadly, Jackson is calling on Uber to formulate a comprehensive plan to hire diversely and commit to working with local businesses, talent and officials in Oakland. The tech company plans an expansion into that San Francisco Bay Area city for either later this year or in early 2018. "We appreciate the attention and focus Rev. Jackson brings to these issues and look forward to continuing our discussions with the RainbowPUSH Coalition," an Uber spokeswoman said in a statement. Jackson is asking Uber to create a program and commitment to reflect the diversity of Oakland across its workforce, leadership and its outside vendors. Jackson has given Uber a deadline of Feb. 15 to meet these requests, although he didn't say what will happen if it fails to respond in time. "Change must be real," Jackson said. "I assert that Silicon Valley and the tech industry, at your best, can be a tremendously positive change agent for the world; at your worst, you can institutionalize old patterns of exclusion and de facto segregation." This is not the first time Uber has been called on to be more responsive on diversity. In September, a coalition of local Oakland groups and civil rights activists called on Uber to do much of the same before meeting with company officials to discuss possible plans of action. At the meeting, Uber said it planned on bringing 2,300 employees to its upcoming Oakland campus, and it assured the coalition that intends to work with local Oakland vendors. "The question is: Is Uber willing to drive people, and black people in particular, out of Oakland, or are they going to sit down at the table with the community and try to be part of the solution?" said Richard Marcantonio, managing attorney at Public Advocates, a nonprofit law firm and California advocacy organization, just prior to the September meeting. Orson Aguilar, president of coalition member The Greenlining Institute, said, "We support the Reverend Jesse Jackson in his call to Uber. Uber has been suspiciously quiet on their diversity data and we believe that the company is to ashamed to release their poor data." Although Uber works with various hiring groups that focus specifically on helping companies increase their diversity, the company has not been public about its diversity efforts. In September, the company had been on the lookout for a head of diversity after losing its previous executive, Damien Hooper-Campbell, to eBay. That listing for that position is no longer up, but it is unclear if the role was filled. Updated on 1/6 with a response from Uber. Published on: Jan 5, 2017 Advertisement

A Startup Is Raising $1 Billion To Try Medicine 15 0 0 January 5, 2017 Can A Blood Test Detect Cancer Early? A Startup Is Raising $1 Billion To Try John Hopkins Cancer continues to be a word that causes pain and fear. There is a great chance that you, or someone close to you, have been affected by some form of cancer. Statistics posted by the American Cancer Society estimate that there were nearly 1.7 million new cases of cancer in 2015, along with an estimated 600,000 deaths. Experts agree that the best chance someone affected by this malady has is early detection. A relatively new startup, named GRAIL, has set its sights on helping that cause by developing a blood test to detect cancer early, and is raising $1 billion for the effort. Jeff Huber, a former Google employee, serves as the chief executive for GRAIL, Forbes reports. He helped lead the development of some of Google’s most iconic products, including Google Maps and their Ads product. GRAIL was started in late 2015 by their parent company, Illumina. Illumina is a company whose goal is to “apply innovative technologies to the analysis of genetic variation and function, making studies possible that were not even imaginable just a few years ago.” They have been studying the human genome to try and help all forms of medicine. Now, GRAIL will be spinning out to stand on its own, though Illumina will be keeping a 20 percent stake in the company. The announcement was posted on Business Wire and shared by Huber on Facebook. More than just a desire to help his fellow man, Huber also has a personal reason for wanting to aid in the early cancer detection endeavor. His wife died of colon cancer on November 10, 2015, at the age of 46. “It’s very mission-driven for me,” he told Forbes in an interview. Early detection of cancer gives the patient the best chance. [Image by Christopher Furlong/Getty Images] While GRAIL is hopeful and driven to find a way to use blood testing and genome mapping to detect cancer early, Huber knows that the venture is not going to be an easy one. He states that developing a blood test that can detect cancer in the earliest stages would take “ultra-intense genome sequencing and two or three orders of magnitude deeper than anyone else is doing.” He also acknowledges that cancer comes in many forms and they vary greatly. “It is really driven by mutations. Every case of cancer is unique. It is a snowflake. Being able to [find it] with medical and statistical rigor drives clinical studies of unprecedented scale.” In their press release, GRAIL said that it has received interest from investors for the $1 billion amount. This means that the money has not been received and the amount could change. They released the information to inform investors of their intentions and how they plan to use the money. This will give other investors the opportunity and information they may need to decide to invest also. The main investor has been pushed by Robert Nelsen, an ARCH venture capitalist. He has been involved with investments in other biotech companies such as Juno Therapeutics for cancer research and Denali Therapeutics for Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates invested $100 million in GRAIL [Image by Dan Kitwood/Getty Images] Diagnostics test for cancer and other diseases are not without their controversy as well. Some doctors feel that some of these procedures can sometimes cause unnecessary harm to patients. They use mammography for breast cancer and PSA for prostate cancer as examples. They also fear that these kinds of tests, like GRAIL’s blood test, may lead to patients being warned that they have cancer when they may not, or before anything can be done about it. Even so, GRAIL is committed to finding such a test. They have already announced a 10,000-person clinical trial, and they expect that trials including hundreds of thousands will be necessary. They also know that better machine-learning technologies will need to come about for the blood test to be successful. It seems that a lot more is to come from this endeavor and what it may mean for cancer diagnosis in the future.

The Oculus Rift virtual reality technology works by creating two images - one for each eye - which mimics the way that vision naturally works. Picture: EWN Google Virtual reality headset Virtual reality Email Print Tweet Share Reuters | 10 days ago LAS VEGAS - Alphabet Inc.’s Google quickened the pace of its push into virtual and augmented reality this week as its hardware partners announced new devices featuring the company’s technology at the CES electronics show in Las Vegas. Google has been trying to position the vast network of smartphones running its Android operating system for virtual and augmented reality, known as VR and AR, fields that many in the technology industry say are poised to go mainstream after years of niche appeal. Chinese manufacturer Huawei Technologies Co announced on Thursday that two of its phones will soon work with Daydream View, a VR headset released last year by Google. Meanwhile, Taiwanese manufacturer AsusTek Computer Inc. announced that its ZenFone AR will support both Daydream and Google’s Tango software for AR, in which computer-generated content is overlaid on the real world. While the announcements expand the line-up of participating phones, Google still has much to do to take its technology to the masses, said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research, noting that Samsung Electronics Co, the largest Android manufacturer, has yet to sign on. “Google’s ecosystem for both AR and VR is in the very early days,” he said. As growth in the global smartphone market shows signs of slowing, some manufacturers are voicing optimism that AR and VR will revive consumer enthusiasm. “This is the next wave of technology that is really going to get consumers excited about smartphones,” Erik Hermanson, Asus’s head of marketing for mobile products, said at the show. But mainstream consumer interest in the technology remains largely unproven. Apps might be expected to stimulate demand, but until Google’s technology is available on a wider range of phones, it will be tough to persuade developers to build for the platform, analysts said. “We are waiting for app developers to really use the platform for what it’s for,” Amit Singh, a vice president for VR at Google, told reporters. In addition to supporting Daydream, Huawei said that it is exploring opportunities for Tango with Google. The Asus phone became the first to support both technologies. Google has stressed that the programs do not overlap for now, but by pursuing both, the company can position itself for success regardless of whether AR or VR becomes a mainstream hit.

MY PHNOM PENH: Chamnan Muon, Consultant and Tech Blogger Fri, 6 January 2017 Vandy Muong Consultant and Tech Blogger Chamnan Muon got his start in the digital and technology sector after he volunteered with the Google community in 2013 as a map maker. Originally from Battambang, the computer science graduate is now an information-technology consultant at the Cambodia-Japan Cooperation Center. This week, Vandy Muong met him at the CJCC to talk about his digital life in the capital. Cambodia-Japan Cooperation Center (CJCC) CJCC is an education centre and working space related to education. I started working there in 2011 in information technology and as part of their PR staff. So I’m involved in all the IT, website, social media, press and poster design work. I often meet there with colleagues on weekends because it’s a good place to work and learn; it’s a place where I feel I know who I am. I created a digital marketing service team because I like learning about technology. We offer consulting services to friends who have problems with ideas and technical issues with digital projects, so we tell them about techniques to reach their goal. Beyond the Post Office In Cambodia, the Post Office is the only place that people can send and get things from overseas. But, in other countries, when people buy online, they send things with a postal code to a specific place. It is the right time to have this in Cambodia, which is why I’m in the process of creating it for Phnom Penh. For me, I like ordering stuff online (eBay or Aliexpress), which is what pushed me to share this idea. This article [about creating a postal code system for Cambodia] is the most viewed and popular on my blog. I want to list all provinces (not only in Phnom Penh) in one customised map. Right now, the big challenge of receiving mail from overseas is for local authorities to know where to deliver packages. Google Business Group Phnom Penh Google Business Group Phnom Penh is a community of business professionals, entrepreneurs or basically anyone who is interested in Google products. When I was in university, I was passionate about science and technology. At the time [2013], I learned to analyse statistics on Google news [and] volunteered to get involved with the Google community here. I received training and had the chance to map the location of tourist sites and local businesses on Google Maps. In 2015, Google Maps created a new community called the Google guide community and I became a map maker and organiser for them. I participated in Google digital business marketing in Vietnam in 2015 and had a chance to join Google guide local summit in the US last year. The football pitch During my free time, I exercise and read books. People say music or games can reduce stress to help relax, but I don’t like music and I never have music in my phone or laptop, except I do have video games for my children. When I am stressed, I play football or search for new videos or news related to digital and technology developments. Photography is also one of my hobbies. It helps entertain me a lot. Football is a good sport for team-building among co-workers and friends, but unfortunately I don’t get to play that often due to time constraints. Himawari hotel The Himawari Hotel is one of the more high-end hotels in Phnom Penh. After I graduated from university majoring in computer science in 2008, my first full-time job was there … [working in] internet support and service. With my background in information technology, I worked as an IT officer at the Himawari for almost two years. Each workplace I’ve been at has had a different culture or way of working and the people [at the Himawari] were friendly. It’s different from working in an educational institution.
