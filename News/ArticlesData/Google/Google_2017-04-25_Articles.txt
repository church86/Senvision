When he's not bothering his chihuahuas, Mikah spends entirely too much time and money on HomeKit products. You can follow him on Twitter at @mikahsargent if you're so inclined. Putting together a smart home takes time, money, patience, and a little elbow grease. I've been building out my smart home (I'm still not entirely sold on that term) for quite awhile. I've got smart lights, smart plugs, smart motion sensors, smart fans, a smart garage door … I'll save you the time and sum things up: I've got a boat-load of smart gadgetry in my home. And as I've built things out, set up automations, cut back, expanded, swapped out products, upgraded devices, and more, I've come to realize there are a few apps, tools, and products that have made my smart home experience a delight. Whether this will be your first foray into smart home territory or you're a seasoned home automator who's just itching to expand, I've put together a list of five things every smart home owner should have to make their experience all the more delightful and all the more useful! 1. An app to control your smart home No one smart-home-product manufacturer has been successful in providing everything you need for your smart home setup. As you start to build out your automated home, you're going to be buying products from different companies and you're going to need a way to tie them all together (as best you can). If you're rocking an iPhone or other iOS device, I recommend limiting your smart-home purchases to HomeKit-enabled accessories, because you'll be able to control all your devices simply and securely with your voice (via Siri) and your iOS device (via HomeKit). If you're not rocking an iPhone (or just want to buy non-HomeKit-enabled accessories), worry not! There are some apps and services that can help you tie things together. Home The Home app for iOS is a fantastic (and simple) way to control all your HomeKit-enabled accessories. You can use the app to install new HomeKit-enabled accessories, monitor your home's status, turn on and off lights, activate scenes, adjust devices in individual rooms, set up automations, view HomeKit-enabled cameras, invite guests to control your HomeKit-enabled accessories, and more. I won't go into too much detail here on what the Home app can do and how it works because I've already done that! You can learn everything you need to know about HomeKit and the iOS Home app by clicking below: Learn more Elgato Eve Not only does Elgato make a fan-friggin'-tastic set of HomeKit-enabled smart home products, the company makes one of the best third-party apps for controlling your HomeKit home. Where iOS's Home app is a simple way to get going with your smart home, the Eve app lets you monitor and control your home in great detail and with incredible nuance. When I needed to figure out a way to have my lights turn on as soon as a motion sensor was triggered and turn off again after a certain period of time, Elgato's Eve app allowed me to do just that. The app also provides detailed information about power usage, charts contact sensor interactions, motion, and more. It's a full-featured app for a person who wants more out of their HomeKit-enabled smart home. Free - Download now Wink As promised, the Wink app is one of the apps I mentioned that can help tie various smart home products together regardless of their HomeKit compatibility. Before I had a Wink Hub 2 in my home, I was able to use the Wink app to control my August Smart Lock, Ecobee thermostat, iHome SmartPlug, Nest Cam, and Philips Hue Lights. The app provides simple, individual control of supported smart home devices as well as smart home scenes (Wink calls them Shortcuts) and automations (Wink calls them Robots). You can set up a Good Night Shortcut, for example that turns off all the lights in your home and turns up the heat on the thermostat. A Robot, on the other hand, would let you set up an automation that, say, turned on the lights in your garage as you arrived home. You won't get the same level of integration as you can with HomeKit and the iOS Home app, but the Wink app does a pretty good job of bringing together various devices all in one place. Free - Download now Home Assistant Home Assistant isn't for everyone, but it's one of the most all-encompassing home automation tools I've come across. Running on Python 3, this home automation platform auto-discovers loads of supported devices and gives you access and control as soon as you launch the system. Home Assistant is an open-source platform that's maintained by what's clearly a very committed, active community; the platform supports more than 600 components (various home automation products and services). Notably, after installing and launching Home Assistant I was able to control my Apple TV from the platform's web interface all from my phone! Some other popular components include Amazon Echo, IFTTT, Ecobee, IKEA's new home automation line, Nest, Sonos, and Plex. If you're comfortable fiddling with Raspberry Pis or digging around in Terminal, you might give Home Assistant a go — this service aims to bring together any and all of the home automation products you add to your home and it does a doggone good job at it. Learn more 2. An in-home voice assistant Siri is a fine means of controlling your smart home but nothing beats the always-on, hyper-focused devotion of an in-home voice assistant. There's something comforting about knowing you've got a means of control that doesn't need to recharge at the end of the day (or in the middle of the day if you forgot to plug in your phone the night before). These devices are tailor-made to be your virtual, voice-activated assistant and they do a damn fine job of it. I'm sure some will disagree but I hold you're not rocking a true smart home until you can reliably control it with your voice. Amazon Echo While I'm tapping away at the iOS Home app, I listen to my partner (my own personal litmus test for how normal, everyday people use technology) gleefully use Alexa to play music, control our lights and thermostat, and get the daily forecast. Amazon has stepped up in a big way when it comes to the smart home. Where Apple has chosen a rigorous, security-focused approach with HomeKit compatibility, Amazon has made Alexa integration swift and flexible. As a result, Alexa supports a whole host of smart home devices. See at Amazon If you want to learn more about the Amazon Echo or Amazon's Alexa smart assistant, you can check out all our coverage: Amazon Echo Oh! If you're not keen on giving up Siri control of your smart home devices, there's plenty of overlap between Alexa and Siri; this list has everything you need: These smart home accessories work with Amazon's Alexa and Apple's HomeKit Google Home Google Home is Google's take on the always-on, in-home smart assistant. It's tied to Google's services, of course, so if you're firmly in the Google Products camp (Gmail, Google Calendar, Android, etc.) Google Home was made for you! The beautifully designed device features some pretty powerful, nice-sounding speakers that make it a better music-listening device than the Amazon Echo, but it's still got some catching up to do in terms of smart home support. Google semi-regularly adds new smart home integrations, but its list of supported devices pales in comparison to both Apple and Amazon. That said, the device has some pretty powerful tie-ins with automation-service IFTTT; with a little fiddling you can control smart home products that you'd otherwise be unable to control. Google is skilled at taking user data and doing truly useful things with it; I expect the company will apply some of that same magic in future updates of the Google Home. See at Best Buy 3. Smart lighting I've said it before and here it is again: There's no clearer, cooler way to show off the power of smart home products than smart lighting. Every smart home owner needs to have at least a couple smart bulbs in their home, because there's no better way to sell your smart home obsession to doubters than to magically (not using a light switch) control your lights. Let the haters bask in the glory of your sunset-timed yard lights and pink-hued multicolor bulbs. Smart lights are also one of the most diverse product categories so there's plenty of room for experimentation: You can have LED strips below your cabinets, color-changing bulbs in your media room, automatic lights in your yard, dimmable recessed lighting in your ceiling — and control all of that with your voice, a mobile device, a smart switch, an automation, etc. Another reason smart bulbs make the list: Smart bulbs are among the least expensive smart home products you can buy. If you're just getting started, you can quickly build out your smart home without breaking the bank. Best Low-Cost Lights for Your Smart Home It's also worth noting smart bulbs — particularly Philips Hue bulbs — are some of the most universally compatible smart home products. When you're trying a new voice assistant, app, or service, you need something with which to test it; chances are your bulbs are going to offer more integrations than your smart lock (and that's a good thing). See at Amazon 4. A hub or HomeKit Much like the apps I mentioned before, hubs (and HomeKit) can help you tie together products from different smart-home-product manufacturers. It's a pretty crummy experience having to jump from app to app to control your smart home devices; you need an easy way to be the maestro of your smart home no matter whose brand adorns the lights, plugs, fans, and sensors in your home. HomeKit HomeKit is a framework created by Apple that lets smart-home-product manufacturers offer centralized, secure control of their devices with Siri and the home app for iOS. Apps — like the Eve app I mentioned before — can also use HomeKit to offer smart home control. While I'm a big fan of HomeKit and Apple's take on smart home control, there are still many products that aren't compatible. That's when you need a hub! Smart home hubs and HomeKit alternatives I've put together a list of the best HomeKit alternatives with compatibility information. You can learn a little bit about different smart home hubs and devices and what products they support. Best Alternatives to HomeKit Depending on the size of your smart home and the smart products you've already invested in, you might find yourself needing more than one of the alternatives I've listed — that's OK. There's no right answer (in my opinion, at least) for smart home configuration. Use the products and services that work for you in the way you want them to work. Heck, that's the whole point of having a smart home in the first place! 5. A toolbox (or a hired hand) There are plenty of smart home products that don't require complicated installation if you'd rather avoid it, but if you really want to supercharge your smart home you're going to need a little DIY magic (or a hired hand). One of my all-time favorite HomeKit-enabled smart home products is an in-wall dimming kit from Lutron. When I moved into my current home, I ran into an issue where many of the lighting fixtures featured ceiling fans with tiny candelabra bulbs, so I couldn't Philips Hue my way out of the situation. I came across the in-wall Lutron Caséta dimmers and I never looked back. I have them installed all over my house now and actually prefer them to smart bulbs. See at Amazon Installing them wasn't as easy as screwing in a bulb and flipping on a switch, though. I had to cut power at the breaker, rewire outlets, cut new holes for device boxes, troubleshoot wiring issues, etc. It was a load of fun for me, but it certainly required some research and a trip to the ol' toolbox. If you foresee yourself installing a smart thermostat, smart fans, in-wall smart lighting, a smart sprinkler system, or any other advanced-installation smart products, you're going to want to make sure you have the necessary tools on hand or call in a professional!

Tech Industry by Claire Reilly April 25, 2017 10:48 PM PDT @reillystyley Oh the humanity! Getty Images It's finally happened. I find myself writing the words "Google dirigible" and it seems like a perfectly normal thing to say. Silicon Valley has finally come full circle. The giddy era of retro-futuristic air travel could well be upon us, with Google co-founder Sergey Brin reportedly building his very own airship, according to Bloomberg reports, citing four people familiar with the project. The top-secret build is reportedly being carried out in a hangar at the NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California -- just 10 minutes down the road from Google's global headquarters. Brin is no stranger to futuristic travel. He's predicted the rise of robot cars, and his right-hand man, fellow Google founder Larry Page, has backed his own flying car startup, Kitty Hawk. So there you have it. Whether it's by flying car or futuristic airship, Google will get you there in style. Google declined a request for comment.

By: Shilpa Published: Wednesday, April 26, 2017, 11:00 [IST] Recently Google has released a feature for Google Maps which helps us in parking our vehicle without any difficulty. Initially, this parking difficulty icon was launched as an Android beta and now its available as a stable build. Now another helpful feature just became official which reminds you of parked location as well. So that Google Maps on both Android and iOS devices will now be able to remember the location where you parked your vehicle once you have arrived. This feature works almost similar in both the mobile operating system but with few design tweaks. Let us see how it works. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates! On Android If you own an Android device, then download the updated Google Maps app from Play store. Once the app gets loaded on your phone, open it to explore the new features. Also Read: Google Maps update for iOS adds location sharing, new directions widget Once you park the vehicle at the proper location, you just have to tap the blue dot and save your parking which then drops a pin with the label "You parked here." Tapping on the same pin opens another card which allows you to set the reminder to pay the parking meter, click a picture of your parking location, and then share it or write some parking notes. On iOS Even iOS app comes with the same feature but with few changes. If you have connected your phone to the car through Bluetooth or USB, then Google Maps automatically tags your car's location when you disconnect the phone from the car. So, one don't have to actually remember to drop a pin once parked. Like Android app, they can also tap the "Parking location" label present on the app to view or share the parking info. Also Read: Here's how to create, share and edit your Google Maps List Parking difficulty icon The previously launched feature "Parking difficulty icon" helps you in parking your vehicle by providing you with some options. This icon is present in the directions card at the bottom of the display. It provides you with various parking difficulties range based on historical parking data such as limited, medium and easy.

PHOTO: REUTERS SAN FRANCISCO: Waymo, the  self-driving car unit of Google parent Alphabet,  is offering free rides to residents in Arizona as it accelerates efforts to bring autonomous vehicles to the public. The rebranded Google car division announced in a blog post late Monday it was taking applications to be part of its “early rider” program in Phoenix, the capital of the US state, and its suburbs. “We’ll be accepting hundreds of people with diverse backgrounds and transportation needs who want to ride in and give feedback about Waymo’s self-driving cars,” said Waymo chief executive John Krafcik. “The goal of this program is to give participants access to our fleet every day, at any time, to go anywhere within an area that’s about twice the size of San Francisco.” Krafcik said as part of the trial Waymo was adding 500 hybrid minivans to its Arizona fleet — which began with 100 vehicles — as the group edges toward a ridesharing system similar to those offered by Uber, Lyft and others. Google accuses Uber of stealing self-driving car technology “We want as many people as possible to experience our technology, and we want to bring self-driving cars to more communities sooner,” he said. “Our early riders will play an important role in shaping the way we bring self-driving technology into the world  —  through personal cars, public transportation, ride-hailing, logistics and more.” The tech giant has done extensive testing of the Google car, but in recent months has been working to adapt its software to operate on other vehicles — using Chrysler Pacifica cars in Arizona. Sergio Marchionne, CEO of Chrysler’s parent company FCA, said the collaboration “has been advantageous for both companies as we continue to work together to fully understand the steps needed to bring self-driving vehicles to market.” Waymo said it has been quietly conducting a small-scale trial over the past month in the Phoenix area, taking participants to work, school, soccer practices and other activities. Alphabet adds patent claim to Uber intellectual property theft lawsuit Most major automakers and several other technology firms have been stepping up efforts on autonomous driving in recent years, contending these systems will eliminate the vast majority of road accidents. Apple is the latest to have obtain a testing permit in California. German luxury carmaker Daimler and auto parts supplier Bosch announced plans this month to work together to create completely driverless cars in the next few years. US-based Tesla is also stepping up efforts, as are several Chinese technology firms and the major US, Asian and European manufacturers. The Google car already has undergone millions of miles of testing. But the latest drive appears to be part of an effort to challenge Uber head-on. The two firms are in the middle of a heated legal battle, with Alphabet filing a lawsuit earlier this year accusing Uber of stealing its technology. Waymo announced at the Detroit auto show this year that it would develop its self-driving technology with multiple partners, positioning itself as an automotive supplier.

However a couple of weeks ago it was spotted within the Google app that there are references made to a device codenamed “Bisto”. However according to the latest teardown of the Google app which has since been updated to version 7.1.21.21, it has been discovered that all and any references made to “Bisto” have since been removed. We’re not sure if the removal could be because Google doesn’t want the public to speculate about what it could be, or if the removal could be because it is in reference to an old project that might no longer in the works. At the moment it is unclear as to what Bisto is, but it is definitely not a smartphone or tablet. There were references made about how notifications could be read aloud inside of headphones, which some have speculated could be some kind of audio-based wearable. However given that it has since been removed, it’s hard to say what it could be. It may or may not surface again in the future, but for now whatever Bisto is or was is something we guess we’ll never know unless Google decides to share their plans. Filed in General >Rumors.

Of the 2016 Penn graduates who took full-time jobs after graduation, more than half of them are working in these three industries, with 25 percent in finance, 17 percent in consulting and 15 percent in technology. In many ways, their appeal seems deserved: jobs in these industries typically pay well and often act as a launchpad for a stable career path. This is not to mention the social prestige associated with a job offer from Goldman Sachs or the Boston Consulting Group.  For some undergraduates, the allure of a prestigious position can outweigh the demands of the job. Some find themselves applying for or even accepting jobs even when they’re not fully sure of what the job entails.  2016 Wharton graduate Anastasia Lee works as an investment banker in the technology division at Morgan Stanley. After beginning work, she found — to her surprise — that much of her time isn’t spent working on finance at all. “Sometimes you have to [work on] the administrative side of things,” Lee said. “There are things that aren’t necessarily related to finance that you end up helping out with.” Lee had previously worked at Morgan Stanley as an intern, where she said the company made an effort to provide her with an intensive and exciting experience, placing her on big deals that were in execution. Now, as a full-time analyst, her job is less deals-focused and focuses more on the setup or planning for such acquisitions. She said she also spends a lot of time providing data or analysis for clients and her superiors. As students grow more familiar with the pressures of jobs in finance through internships and work experiences, some decide to switch career paths.  Full time industries Create your own infographics “I initially thought I wanted to do finance – because that’s what everyone does,” 2016 Wharton graduate Connie Chen said. After finance internships in Singapore and New York her sophomore and junior summers, Chen landed a job her senior year at a very different company: Google. “I was really interested in renewables and I knew I wanted to pursue that, but I wasn’t sure what aspect of renewables,” Chen said. “I chose Google because I know that eventually I want to work in some kind of renewable tech, and understanding how a technology company works and runs – one of the largest and [most] ubiquitous companies – I thought would be a great start to that.” Chen isn’t a programmer at Google; she works in operations. Coming from a business background, she said she had to learn a lot about the technology sector for her new job. This was a learning curve she didn’t face in finance, where she found that her classes had prepared her more thoroughly. Despite everything she had to learn, Chen said she’s glad to be at Google instead of working in finance. “I don’t want to make tech seem like the holy grail or the promised land, but I think the differences [between finance and technology] are like night and day,” she said. “In finance, depending on where you work, it can be more hierarchical... and it’s less about you initiating projects than you getting work.” Innovation is more welcome in the technology sector, she said, adding that individual interests are also more valued. “I think in tech, it’s very encouraged for you to point our errors or [create] philosophical questions about why something exists to begin with,” she said. “Outside of work hours – or even during work – they encourage you to take your own projects or take courses that you’re interested in.” The day-to-day life of working in these industries is also far different from life at Penn — Lee said that her job at Morgan Stanley is highly unpredictable and prone to change depending on client’s specific needs.  In other ways, though, her life is much more structured now than when she was a student. “If you don’t really care about how you do in a certain class, you can just not study for it, and it’s of no real consequence,” Lee said. “But here, because you have real responsibility, and because you’re getting paid for your services, I think it’s really crucial that you manage your outcomes. [There’s] less flexibility and more responsibility.” Tricia Peralta, another 2016 graduate from the College and Wharton, agreed that a working schedule can be less flexible than student life.  Peralta, who works in McKinsey & Company’s Philadelphia office said that while she has less control over her working hours, it is now more important for her to maintain a work-life balance — especially given the frequent traveling she does as part of her job. Because she typically spends Monday through Thursday out of town at the client’s office, she can sometimes feel isolated on weeknights. Reaching the weekend and “getting her life back” helps her to keep her work and her personal life separate, she said. “In college, it’s always about going the extra mile and working so much harder,” she added. “But in the workplace, the incremental benefits are not as big anymore” – so there’s less stress to spend her official leisure time working. Lee said graduating and entering the workforce has influenced her view of college life, as well as a successful life in general. “The definition of success isn’t [doing] banking after Wharton and private equity after banking,” she said. “A lot of the analysts here think that’s a rat race, and you want to break out of it if you can. Definitely don’t go into banking just to go with the flow or because your peers think highly of your offer.” She stressed that it is important to get to know the culture and environment of a company before accepting a job offer, and recommended reaching out to other Penn alumni who work there.  Lee added that while investment banking can be a valuable starting ground for people who are genuinely interested in finance, she feels that many Penn students go into finance without thinking about what they want longer term. Seeking or accepting a prestigious job offer may seem appealing in the short term, but eventually the novelty wears off, she said. “When you actually start working, you don’t wake up in the morning and say ‘oh my gosh, I’m so glad I’m working at Morgan Stanley’ – the reality of the job hits you really hard,” Lee said. “I think it’s important for anyone at Penn to think about what they’re really passionate about.” All comments eligible for publication in Daily Pennsylvanian, Inc. publications.

Onanuga said this at the opening of a two-day training workshop for staff of the agency on Tuesday in Abuja. The training is being held in collaboration with Google. Onanuga said Google has various tools such as Google search, Google news, Google trend, Google alerts among others that are important for getting facts that can assist journalists in writing their reports. He said: “Google is just not a website. “It gives you an insight of everything that you want to know and ensure that you are on top of your game in terms of what is happening in the country and around the world. “Google has made journalism easy because you can sit down in the comfort of your house and get facts easily from many sources, the social media platforms, on the internet to fill an entire magazine. “Google also most times streams live events all around the world and this is very remarkable. “It is even more remarkable that we are talking of an experience that is just 26 years old, with the founding of the world wide web. “Google itself is 19 years old. “I am very happy that it is happening in my lifetime. “I want to urge everyone to seize this enormous opportunity that Google has provided. “Let every one of us be attentive.” Onanuga said that NAN has over 500 reporters in the six geopolitical zones of the country and there was the need for all them to be trained on using Google. Onanuga also noted that not all staff of the agency are computer compliant and many of them are still learning. While commending Google for the partnership, he called on the organisation to extend the training to other staff in the different zones of the federation. Taiwo Kola-Ogunlade, the Communication and Public Affairs Manager, Anglophone West Africa of Google, said Google was imperative for media professionals as it gives on point news of what is happening all around the world. Kola-Ogunlade said Google would go a long way in enhancing media excellence and creating access to massive information. He urged media practitioners to use Google in order to objective and factual in their reportage. He said: “For instance, we have where images have been used as breaking news stories in unreflective context and in most cases such media houses have been taken to court. “But with Google, you find out if the information is the truth or if such images have been reported before, so you can just ask Google for answers.” Kate Okewu, a participant, said she was privileged to be part of the training as her knowledge on the use of Google tools has increased. Okewu said: “Before I only use Google to check my mail and also to know the meaning of words, but now I am surprised that Google has a lot of tools that will enhance my profession.” Another participant, Ikenna Osuoha, said the training has offered him the opportunity to know the difference between website and internet and also various ways of accessing information on the internet. Osuoha commended the NAN management for facilitating the training.

Fiat Chrysler and Google said today for the first time they will offer rides to the public in the self-driving automobiles they are building under an expanding partnership. DETROIT >> Fiat Chrysler and Google for the first time will offer rides to the public in the self-driving vehicles they are building under an expanding partnership. Waymo, Google’s self-driving car project, said today it’s adding 500 Chrysler Pacifica hybrid minivans to its self-driving vehicle fleet. It will allow hundreds of people in the Phoenix area to take rides in the vehicles so it can get feedback on the experience. Phoenix-area residents could apply on Waymo’s website starting today. The vehicles will also pick up riders in Chandler, Tempe, Mesa and Gilbert, Waymo said. All of the vehicles will have Waymo backup drivers who can take over in an emergency. Fiat Chrysler and Waymo have been partners since last spring, when they announced they would build 100 self-driving Pacifica hybrids minivans. Those vehicles were delivered to Waymo in December. The companies have been testing the vehicles in Arizona, California and Michigan. Waymo began offering a small number of public rides in Arizona two months ago before deciding to expand the program, a spokesman said. Waymo — created by Google in 2009 — has given rides to the public before in its hometown of Mountain View, California. In 2015, it let a blind man ride around Austin, Texas, in one of its completely self-driving pods. The Phoenix program will be much larger in scale, and it will be the first to use the Pacifica minivans. Waymo isn’t the first to put regular passengers in self-driving cars in the race to develop the technology. Ride-hailing company Uber has had self-driving Volvos on the road in Pittsburgh since last fall. Boston startup nuTonomy is giving taxi rides to passengers in Singapore and Boston. In all cases, there is a backup driver behind the wheel. Waymo said it wants to learn where people want to go in a self-driving vehicle, how they communicate with it and what kinds of information and controls they want. Fiat Chrysler builds the Pacifica minivan in Windsor, Canada, just across the border from Detroit. It adds Waymo’s self-driving software and hardware, including sensors and cameras, at a facility in Michigan. Fiat Chrysler’s U.S. headquarters is in Auburn Hills, Michigan. “This collaboration is helping both companies learn how to bring self-driving cars to market, and realize the safety and mobility benefits of this technology,” said Waymo chief John Krafcik in a company release. Michelle Krebs, an executive analyst for the car shopping site Autotrader, says studies have shown that a majority of Americans are still reluctant to ride in a fully self-driving car. Opening Waymo’s vehicles to the public will help build riders’ confidence, she said. “The key to acceptance is exposure and education,” she said. Ultimately, Waymo says, self-driving cars could prevent many of the 1.2 million deaths that occur on worldwide roads each year. Waymo has made clear that it intends to form partnerships with automakers and not build its own self-driving cars. It’s also in talks with Honda Motor Co. about a potential collaboration.

The search giant said Tuesday that it will make it much easier for anyone to give it feedback on its search results, which is the way that most people use Google. For everyday users, that means that if you see a result featured on Google's pages that you think is wrong or offensive, then you can actually do something about it. Google framed the problem as a quality issue. "Today, in a world where tens of thousands of pages are coming online every minute of every day, there are new ways that people try to game the system," said vice president of engineering Ben Gomes in an official blog post. According to Google, approximately .25 percent of its results "have been returning offensive or clearly misleading content." The company didn't specify how many queries that really is - but the search-engine-focused news site Search Engine Land reported that Google estimated in 2015 that it handles 3 billion searches per day. Some back-of-the-envelope math suggests that users could be seeing as many as 7.5 million misleading results every day. Users will see options to report bad information that shows up in "Featured Snippets" - a.k.a., the little summary boxes that appear at the top or sides of Google searches. They will also be able to report offensive autocomplete suggestions - the suggested phrases that show up when you begin typing a query in the search engine. Users can report suggestions for being hateful, explicit or violent. For the snippets, users can also report when the summaries are inaccurate. Google has also tweaked its search algorithms to ensure that "low-quality" content shows up lower in search results, which should minimize their reach. This should address issues such as one Google dealt with last year, when a prominent Holocaust denial site showed up at the top of search results for "did the holocaust happen." Since the US election, several companies including Google and Facebook have taken steps to deal with false information that looks legitimate being passed through their products. In the past, both companies have been hesitant to step in and provide quality controls for information that appears on their products, preferring instead to let their algorithms weed out bad results. And like Facebook, Google has recently undertaken broader efforts to fight misleading information and hate speech online. The company has started pairing some claims online with fact-check articles, which say whether a claim is true or false. It has also released a tool for developers to let them automatically moderate online messages better. Google users will start seeing the reporting options Tuesday. This particular effort has been underway since mid-December, said Google spokeswoman Susan Cadrecha in an email. © 2017 The Washington Post For the latest tech news and reviews, follow Gadgets 360 on Twitter, Facebook, and subscribe to our YouTube channel.

Galaxy S8 and S8+ review: Another pair of excellent mainstream smartphones from Samsung David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/04/18 7:59am PDTApr 18, 2017 21 Plus 1 on G+ 106 Share on Facebook 76 Share on Twitter Total Shares203 Galaxy S8 Galaxy S8+ News Phone Reviews Article Contents 1 The Good 2 The Not So Good 3 Design and materials 4 Display 5 Battery life and charging 6 Storage, wireless, and call quality 7 Audio and speakers 8 Camera 9 Performance 10 Testing notes 11 Software 11.1 What's new 11.1.1 Navigation keys 11.1.2 Bixby 11.1.3 Snap window 11.1.4 Dual audio 11.1.5 Separate app sound 11.1.6 Other changes 11.2 General UI (launcher, notifications, lockscreen, navigation keys) 11.3 Software: Opinion 12 Value 13 Conclusion When you talk about Samsung's Galaxy smartphones, it's hard not to talk about 'the average consumer.' Because the Galaxy S series is the second-most popular line of smartphones on earth, its audience is unashamedly mainstream, and the vast majority of sales of these devices will be to consumers who aren't what you'd call tech-savvy. The issue for Samsung, increasingly, is learning how to split the difference between a smartphone that provides a good experience for everybody and maintaining that all important credibility with its fans and enthusiasts. The Galaxy S8 and S8+, for example, have Quad HD displays - the best ones I've ever seen. But they're set to 1080p by default for improved performance. And as enthusiasts clamor for ever-larger batteries, Samsung has put very average, if not exactly small, ones in these new phones (though they should degrade less noticeably). The S8 is still a slippery metal and glass sandwich that essentially requires additional protection unless you like to live life on the edge, which is great news for case manufacturers, but less so for you and me. And then there's the new fingerprint scanner, which is just a bit tragic (especially on the S8+). Of course, there are big upsides: the latest chipset from Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 835, ensures that the Galaxy S8 will probably have the best LTE performance of any phone on the market here in the US. That chip also brings features like Bluetooth 5.0, improved Wi-Fi performance, and better image signal processors for the cameras. Samsung's Infinity Display is genuinely breathtaking: this is the best screen I've seen on a smartphone, period. The rear-facing camera is still great, the quality of the phone itself seems almost unimpeachable, and Samsung continues to make legitimate value-adds to the smartphone experience with features like Samsung Pay, wireless charging, and advanced network feature support across all four major US carriers. The fact that you can just walk in to a store and buy one generally speaking (ahem, Google) is something worth pointing out, too. Samsung's ubiquity is absolutely a product feature. Like the S7 and S7 edge last year, the S8 and S8+ feel iterative - in a good way. But I also believe they're evidence that what makes a smartphone "great" is becoming more and more subjective. These are great smartphones, but how great really depends a lot on your priorities. The Good Display The best displays I've ever seen on a smartphone. They're bright, they're beautiful, they have excellent viewing angles, and tiny little bezels. You get a ton of screen in a remarkably compact package. Battery I only tested the S8+ in depth, but the battery life on this phone was great. If you disable the always-on display, it gets even better. Camera While I still prefer the Pixel's camera, the S8's has its own strengths, including excellent low-light performance, fast captures, and bright, vivid colors. GraceUX isn't bad TouchWiz has come a long way. Setting aside the conversation about updates, I find GraceUX perfectly good, and Samsung has genuine value-adds in the software these days. Virtual keys FINALLY. Samsung has entered the modern Android era and given us virtual navigation keys. It has noticeably improved my feelings about using a Samsung phone. The Not So Good Fingerprint scanner I actively hate the fingerprint scanner on the S8+. It may be better on the standard S8. But yeah, it's bad. Updates The S8 and S8+ ship with Android 7.0, and I've seen exactly nothing from Samsung indicating they plan to change their attitude about timely Android platform updates. Bixby Is utterly worthless. A waste of a perfectly good hardware key. So much glass I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases. Pricey At $750 and $850 for the S8 and S8+, respectively, there's no denying Samsung is asking a lot for the privilege of joining the Galaxy S club this year. Design and materials Not all glass and metal sandwiches are created equal. With the S8 and S8+, Samsung has proven once again that, yes, there is still room for refinement when it comes to packaging and polishing a smartphone. To call these phones "pretty" would be to do them a disservice (I also don't necessarily think it's true). They have an almost precious quality to them, something that tends to be strongly evoked when you hold them in the slightly awkward "claw" grip a curved-edge smartphone sort of requires. But the phones look and feel so solid - their seams so uniform and tight - that you get the sense they can't even be taken apart, because they must have been forged whole in some kind of dark ritual (especially in this black finish). I don't mean to fawn, but when you compare Samsung's industrial design here on the S8+ to something like the Google Pixel XL, the Pixel looks and feels like yesterday's smartphone. And I don't just mean the bezels. Compare it to the Galaxy S7 edge, and the new S8+ is clearly a more moderate step forward, though. The biggest change is of course the display, which we will get to soon, but let's talk about those bezels. Samsung hasn't made what you'd call a "bezelless" phone (no one has), but their bezel reduction approach is more similar to LG's than, say, Xiaomi's. Instead of making the ludicrous compromise of moving the front-facing camera and various sensors down to the chin of the phone and messing with the earpiece speaker just to achieve that not-bezelless look, Samsung's chopped off some bezel on both the top and bottom. The result is much more screen in a package that doesn't need to grow dramatically to accommodate it. This is the smart approach to maximizing screen-to-body ratio (conversely, I would argue the Xiaomi approach is not smart). The one compromise Samsung had to make was the home button - it was time for it to go. We'll talk more about the software keys later, but for those of you who liked to tap the home key to quickly check your notifications, be at ease: it has a replacement. The pressure-sensitive, always-on virtual home key can be configured to wake the screen on a double tap or long press for quick glances. As you know, this also means the fingerprint scanner had to be put... somewhere else. Samsung hasn't chosen well. The fingerprint scanner on the Galaxy S8+, in particular, is nothing short of a bad experience. My success rate on reads hovers around 50% at the time of this writing, and it's become a frustration so constant that I've started to feel a bit annoyed by the whole thing. Why couldn't it have gone in a more natural, isolated location below the camera sensor? It's not just the reach - the scanner itself is incredibly finicky about making sure the whole sensor area is covered, and sometimes just doesn't recognize my finger is on it at all. This is not to mention that said scanner is right next to the camera, which has the same sort of raised edge design as the scanner and feels exactly the same to your finger. Unlocking the S8+ with your right hand requires immense discipline and active attention to how you grasp the phone. It isn't even worth the trouble (my fingers are pretty long, by the way). With your left, it's doable as you build up the muscle memory instead of having to actively feel out the scanner. But I use a lot of phones, and this is hands down the worst fingerprint scanner I have used since Samsung's old swipe-to-read ones. It boggles my mind how far backward Samsung has gone with this experience. Even the registration process is annoying: it refused to read any of my attempts to register the sides and edges of my finger because the scanner wasn't completely covered. Anyway, that's my fingerprint scanner rant. Samsung, you messed this up. On the bottom of the phone you'll find the 3.5mm headphone jack, a USB 3.0 Type C port, the microphone, and the outlet for the speaker. The design of the power key is unchanged, but Samsung has switched back to a rocker for the volume key to avoid confusion with the new Bixby button. The buttons all provide good feedback and have a nice, clicky feel. I will say the volume rocker is a bit high up on the S8+, presumably in order to make room for said Bixby key. Out back, the camera hump is gone, meaning you can tap away at the S8 sitting on a flat surface and it won't rock or wobble (at least, not significantly). To the right of the sensor is the fingerprint scanner, and to the left is the flash and Samsung's weirdly persistent heart-rate monitor. On the front, things have become substantially more subdued with this generation of phone. The earpiece speaker is much smaller, the Samsung logo is nowhere to be found (a victory, I would say), and there's no chroming or accents around any of the sensors or front-facing camera. All colors of the Galaxy S8 have black bezels around the screen, so no matter which shade you choose, you'll get a pretty stealthy fascia. Undoubtedly, some of you are coming into this review with a question: S8 or S8+? If you're currently using a Galaxy Note5, S6 edge+, or S7 edge, I would actually advise you to consider the S8 over the larger model I'm testing here. The S8+ is a big phone - as tall as a Nexus 6, if not nearly as wide. This will make pocketability a genuine question for some, especially if you're going to be throwing a case on this big, expensive slab of metal and glass. If you typically find yourself liking a 5.5-5.7" smartphone, I'd say go for the regular S8. But if you do want something bigger, the S8+ offers a ton of screen in a package that is a lot easier to handle than phablets (sorry, sorry) of the past. Because all of the extra display area is packaged vertically, the phone is still very narrow and easy to manage with one hand - for most tasks. Reaching the top of the screen can be a real bear, and that can mean risky maneuvers (i.e., potentially dropping it) to access certain parts of the UI one-handed. I still think it's way easier to manipulate than my old Nexus 6, though. The comparative narrowness makes my grip on it a lot more confidence-inspiring, even if those stretches for the notification bar can feel a bit dicey. And because I wasn't sure where else to put it: Yes, the multi-color notification LED is still there. Even with the reduced bezel, Samsung managed to hold on to it. Display If you're sick and tired of hearing every year that "Samsung has done it again - the best smartphone display ever!" then I am sorry, you will continue to be sick and tired. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ have the best smartphone screens. Ever. They get extremely bright, the colors are exceptionally vivid (or accurate, if you switch to the Basic display mode), viewing angles are excellent, blacks are very deep, and the AMOLED panel can get ultra-dim for those late-night reading sessions. Samsung continues to demonstrate that its Super AMOLED technology is the gold standard for displays with the Galaxy S8, and that the bar can still be raised higher yet. I'm always impressed with Samsung's ability to iterate this technology with such consistent success. While this is a Quad HD panel with a native resolution of 2960x1440 (that's a lot of pixels), Samsung configures the S8 and S8+ out of the box to run at 1080p (2220x1080). Why? Because it improves performance. And that feels like something of a copout, doesn't it? Google can run the Pixel XL with its older, less efficient Snapdragon 821 chip at full QHD resolution and achieve performance and battery life that go toe-to-toe with a fresh-out-of-the-box Galaxy S8+. So, why make the phones QHD at all? VR! At least, that's a convenient scapegoat. Notably, you can change the resolution manually to the full QHD. I'll have a few more words about this in the performance section of the review, so stay tuned. Getting back to the screen, I found it worked well even in direct sunlight, with Samsung's ultra-high contrast overboost mode kicking in to maximize readability even in the most challenging conditions. Sure, that'll drain your battery real fast, but it's better than not being able to see your phone. The Galaxy S8s also have support for HDR video, but I believe it's only the HDR10 standard (not Dolby Vision). As far as I know, this will work with select apps that are specifically optimized for Samsung devices, so I would expect adoption of this in a wide way will be fairly slow for the time being outside the core video services like Netflix and Amazon. Still, it's good to have, because the screens on these phones really do deserve HDR video to fully take advantage of their impressive capabilities - especially those positively inky black levels. I applaud Samsung for continuing to include its helpful screen mode setting, which allows you to choose one of four color profile presets depending on how you want the screen to look. The "basic" mode offers the most unforgivingly accurate reproduction of colors, something I find helpful when reviewing photos. Finally, let's talk about the edge. Last year, I was pretty clear on my feelings about the Galaxy S7 edge having issues properly rejecting fingers or palms at the edge of the display. Because of the way curved-edge displays are shaped and the fact that Samsung curves both the front and the back of the device, it's essentially impossible to hold a curved-edge phone without your fingers or palms touching the edge of the screen. On the S7 edge, this was absolutely maddening at times. It made the phone nearly impossible for me to use if I was lying on my back, for example, doing some email in bed, and it was one of the reasons I stopped using it so quickly after my review period. I am happy to report that it looks like Samsung has given some serious attention to the issue of edge rejection. I tapped out a full email on the S8+ lying back on the couch and didn't get a single misread character or failure to respond to input. I browsed the web, scrolled through Twitter, did some texting, and it all went off without a hitch. That's cause for a sigh of relief - I was really worried Samsung would just continue to act like this issue didn't exist. Battery life and charging I've only been using the Galaxy S8+, so that's the phone I can give you battery life impressions on. My take so far is that battery life is at least as good as the Snapdragon Galaxy S7 edge from last year, a phone that offered above-average performance in this area. In single-day heavy use, the phone could reliably get 5 hours of screen time, sometimes creeping closer to 6 hours. That's very good - exceeding the Pixel XL in performance, even. Will the Exynos variant once again clean Qualcomm's clock on efficiency? I guess we'll have to see how they compare in reviews around the web. Still, the S8+ does really well here, and if you want the version of the phone that's going to be able to power you through the most usage possible, that extra 500mAh of capacity (3500mAh total for the S8+) over the standard S8 isn't anything to sneeze at - and I doubt the larger display cannibalizes all of it. Samsung has also claimed that these batteries should hold up better over the long haul than those in last year's phones, saying that the S8 and S8+ will retain 95% of their effective capacity after a full year of typical usage (the S7 retained just 80%). That's welcome news, because as we all know, battery life doesn't tend to get better as a phone ages. The idle drain on the S8+ wasn't particularly great in my experience, but that's because I had the always-on display enabled. Samsung estimated on the S7 that you'd drain under 1% of your battery per hour with the feature turned on, so I think those of you really looking to get every bit of battery bang for your buck possible will want to turn this off. It does have an effect. I also turned off Samsung's very annoying app "sleep" feature, which looks at apps that are using power in the background but that you don't use regularly and then forces them into an "sleep" state to prevent them from waking the phone. It's well-intentioned, I know, but if I want something like that, I tend to trust Greenify, and honestly, I'm generally OK with letting Android's Doze do its work. Finally, just as a note: all of my testing was done in the standard 1080p mode the phone ships in - I've not turned up the resolution to full QHD. Obviously, if you do this, your battery life will suffer as a result of the increased number of pixels which need to be rendered (apparently not - it's just performance). However, I really can't be sure just how big an effect this will have, and it's not a particularly easy thing to test outside of a highly controlled environment. Charging the S8 and S8+ is just the same as it's been for years with the Galaxy line of phones, using Samsung's Adaptive Fast Charge technology based on Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0. The one change comes in the port, which is now a USB-C connector. Oh, and Samsung has made the charging bricks and cables black now, instead of white. It charges at the same speed all Samsung phones with Adaptive Fast Charge have over the years, and the charger still has a Type A USB port. Samsung says the retention of the older charging tech and Type A port is to make transitioning from legacy products easier for their customers, and it looks like the S8 will even include a microUSB to type C adapter tip in the box. When you sell as many smartphones to "normals" as Samsung, these are very valid considerations, and so while enthusiasts might be a bit miffed than Qualcomm Quick Charge 4.0 and USB Power Delivery aren't in tow here, it's not like the phones charge slowly. Samsung also still includes wireless charging, and it is releasing a new wireless fast charging pad which provides the same speed as the fast charging pad for the S7 did last year. This year, the pad has a rubbery, leather-texture surface and pops up to act as a phone stand, which is kind of cool. Wireless charging is available on all Galaxy S8 models, too - no worrying about regional variants here. Storage, wireless, and call quality The Galaxy S8 and S8+ come with as much storage as you'd like - as long as it's 64GB. There's only one storage tier being offered in the US (I wouldn't be surprised if China gets a 128GB model), but you can expand that with a microSD card. I really will hand it to Samsung for upping their base offering to 64GB - 32GB just doesn't cut it these days, and 128GB can seem a bit overkill. This T-Mobile variant I tested came with 53GB of that available to the user out of the box, which should be more than enough for most of us. Wireless performance on the phone has been excellent for me. Data speeds on T-Mobile have been great, and the Galaxy S8 and S8+ support a large number of advanced network technologies here in the US to ensure you're getting the most possible out of your carrier's network. Be it advanced LTE carrier aggregation, wireless MIMO, VoLTE, HD Voice, Wi-Fi calling, LTE-U - it's all here. You can thank Qualcomm's X16 LTE modem for most of this. A lot of things can be said of Samsung, but they rarely ever miss out on a chance to be a showcase for the carriers' newest features. T-Mobile, for example, says the S8 and S8+ will be the fastest-ever smartphones on its network thanks to 4x4 MIMO, carrier aggregation, and 256 QAM support. Wi-Fi performance on the S8+ has been great for me, and Bluetooth in my car has been flawless, providing strong reception and zero pairing issues (something that can't be said of certain phones starting with "P"). I've come to expect Samsung to get Bluetooth right over the years, and they still are. Bluetooth 5.0 support is on board courtesy of the Snapdragon 835 chipset, but no real consumer devices out there using the standard exist yet. But you can take advantage of some of the standard's increased power right now - for example, Samsung has introduced a new feature called dual audio that lets you stream to two pairs of Bluetooth headphones at once. That's pretty awesome. Audio and speakers The Snapdragon 835 features a newer revision of Qualcomm's Aqstic audio "codec" (basically, the DAC and headphone amplifier), and I do think some noticeable gains have been made here. For one, I feel output on the headphone jack is better - driving big, high-impedance headphones left me with more room on the volume slider than attempting to play the same tracks with my Pixel XL. I also might be hearing some improved bass response, but that could just be the extra "oomf" the new amplifier is providing. Quality itself is still excellent, and I really noticed no difference on that front between the 821 and 835. Annoyingly, Samsung's volume warning still won't let you exceed a certain threshold until you accept a warning dialogue saying you might blow out your ears. It is very annoying. I realize there are laws on the books about this in Europe, but why does this have to be in the firmware for every variant of the phone, and why does it have to tell you every time you plug in a set of headphones? That's certainly not the case with Apple or Google's phones here, but Samsung seems dogged in its resistance to this regional accommodation. Samsung doesn't seem to have really done much with its external speaker. It sounds decent, but the direction it fires and the peak output leave a fair bit to be desired. In the age of waterproofed smartphones with itty-bitty bezels, it's hard to see speakers being a major priority anymore. It's sad, but it's true. Camera I was a fan of the camera on the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, though I do still have my critiques as they've aged: colors are exaggerated and processing can be overbearing. Samsung claims that while the camera in the S8 and S8+ is the same one found in last year's phones, they've done work on the processing side to increase image quality. What does that mean, exactly? For my eyeballs, it means less aggressive sharpening. As with last year's phones, the S8 is an incredibly capable camera in low light conditions. The f/1.7 lens hoovers up a surprising amount of light even in challenging conditions, and with a steady hand you can get some pretty crisp shots where other phones would just render an unpleasing mess of noise and blur. Even Google's Pixel is no match for the S7 in low light - the dual-pixel autofocus and aforementioned lens make a formidable duo in the dark. Photos shoot off fast and the camera launches quickly, though I had honestly hoped for some improvement in speed given the new Spectra ISP the Snapdragon 835 features. In fact, the Galaxy S8's camera still doesn't launch as consistently quickly as my Pixel XL's, especially when using the quick launch feature, where the Pixel XL is very noticeably faster on the draw. That's... not great. It's still quick to start up, but you'd think Samsung would be focusing on this kind of stuff in terms of trying to be the best. Previous Next When we get to the actual business of the photos, I think nearly everyone who buys this phone will be incredibly happy with how their snapshots turn out. They're vivid, crisp, and as I said, the results in challenging light are still as impressive today as they were last year. I definitely approve of Samsung's reduction in the amount of sharpening applied to photos - things just look more natural now. The colors are still a bit unrealistic at times, and Samsung's automatic HDR is nowhere near as impressive as Google's HDR+, meaning you'll still get blowouts in particularly high-contrast scenarios. But the camera is good. In terms of the app experience, Samsung has added Snapchat-like overlays and stickers (for joy), but aside from a new option to place a floating shutter button on the UI, the camera app is essentially unchanged from how it appears on the Galaxy S7's current Nougat build with Grace UX. That means you get a Pro mode with a few more shooting options (including RAW output), filters, slow motion, panorama, hyperlapse, and more. All in all, the camera experience on the S8 hasn't really changed much this year, and while I wouldn't call that a letdown, per se, I don't think Samsung had the best smartphone camera last year overall, and leaving it essentially unchanged for 2017 means it probably won't this year, either. Performance The version of the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing uses Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 chipset, not the Samsung Exynos chip that many other markets around the world will get. If you want to know about the 835's capabilities on paper, we have an extensive post benchmarking its performance. In the real world, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ are the very first smartphones to utilize Qualcomm's new chip. How's that gone? Well, I am happy to report that the Galaxy S8+ I'm testing is very noticeably faster than an S7 edge with a fairly fresh Nougat install. It's a pretty stark difference. Has Samsung conquered the infamous lag its devices develop over longer periods of time? I can't answer that today, obviously, and Samsung really isn't interested in discussing it, either. As more reviewers and eventually consumers spend more time with the phone, we'll be able to better assess that issue. That said, out of the box, the Galaxy S8+ feels almost as quick as my Google Pixel XL. A little faster in some scenarios, too, but I would say the two phones offer reasonably comparable performance based on the week I had to really compare the two. The Pixel XL isn't what I'd call the fastest Android phone for raw speed (I'd say the OnePlus 3T wins there), but it's the consistency of its performance that has really impressed me in the last six months. If Samsung can keep even close to this level of performance on the Galaxy S8 six months from now, that'd be a huge boost for the user experience on its phones. That is, unless you really heat up the S8+. Between benchmark testing runs, I noticed the phone developed the very typical kind of lag I'd found on devices like the Galaxy S7 edge last year. The Pixel doesn't do this. The OnePlus 3T doesn't do this. Why are Samsung phones so aggressively throttling under thermal load? Still, the number of times I worked the phone hard enough in regular use for this to be an issue were negligible - as in, it really didn't happen at all outside the back-to-back benchmarking scenario. One performance asterisk I'd like to point out is that the Galaxy S8 and S8+ do give themselves something of an edge on phones like the G6 and Pixel XL inherently, because they run at 1080p resolution out of the box instead of the 1440p every other QHD phone does, but you really can't tell the difference 95% of the time. On the whole, I'm satisfied with how this phone performs. During the hands-on event, I was much more tepid, as I just didn't have the time to really get a feel, especially comparatively, for the overall smoothness and consistency of the experience. There are, however, some areas where I think Samsung could improve. The way the notification shade draws down feels a bit clunky (not slow, just weird), and sometimes the virtual navigation keys have a split-second delay on interaction. It's also definitely a bit easier to choke up the S8+ with manic opening and closing of apps than the Pixel XL - it does start to get a little overwhelmed when you really, really push it. I also think Google is doing a better job on touch latency, as sometimes the S8+ feels just a bit behind my fingers. As for benchmarks, you probably won't be surprised to learn Samsung's implementation of the Snapdragon 835 isn't as fast as Qualcomm's reference device. I've pasted a results table for popular tests below.

Instead I'm going to devote this section to brief thoughts I've had when using the phone - specific, relatively concise observations about what the Galaxy S8+ is like to use. The fingerprint scanner is too hard to reach on the S8+, misreads are common. You may smudge the camera lens when reaching for the scanner, meaning blurry photos if you're not an obsessive lens wiper like me. I tried to use the iris scanner, but it was even worse than the fingerprint sensor with my glasses, my hit rate was well under 20%. Unlike with the Pixel, Bluetooth performance in my car ('16 Mazda) was great - I didn't even need to take the phone out of my pocket. The S8+ is fairly easy to keep a grip on width-wise, but it is very tall, and pulling down on the notification bar one-handed just feels risky. The top area of my homescreen is basically a no man's land for the same reason. I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, you can't really tell. I didn't end up using the always-on home button feature at all, even though it is kind of neat. If I bought this phone, I'd turn off always-on display to keep the idle battery drain lower. While not the newest or fastest standard, Samsung's 15 watt fast charging still tops up the phone pretty quickly in my experience. On the launcher, the Samsung Pay quick-access peeking thing reduces the size of the touch targets for the nav keys. I switched the navigation key order to the traditional Android layout (back, home, recent apps) and haven't looked back. Samsung's new launcher looks alright but I went straight to Nova, in part to get my round icons back (yes, I have been Pixel indoctrinated). I don't know how anyone lives with the stock Samsung keyboard. Yikes. Even with all this extra vertical space, I still can't find a single compelling reason to split-screen apps on Android. Samsung still isn't allowing "OK Google" hotword recognition when the display is off (probably because Bixby). Software For the purpose of this review, much of my definition of "new" is going to rely on what is new versus a Galaxy S7 running Samsung's GraceUX update on Android 7.0. So with that in mind, let's get to it. What's new Navigation keys The biggest change, of course, is down at the bottom of the screen: virtual navigation keys! I'm not going to get caught up on how they look - I just care that they're there and they work. And you can change them to the proper back-home-recents order, which I did immediately upon setting up the phone. Choice feels good. You can also change the background color for the navbar if you're so inclined. The home button has a few extra tricks up its sleeve, too. It's always on - even if the always-on display mode is off and your screen isn't illuminated, there's a pressure sensitive area where the home button displays. Just press with some force (the amount of force can be adjusted in settings), and your phone will wake up just like you'd pressed a physical home button. You can see why rumors are swirling that Samsung wanted to integrate a fingerprint scanner with this feature - it would make complete sense. The home key will also respond to hard presses even when an app is overlaying the navbar. Honestly, I didn't end up using the hard press feature pretty much ever. You can also set it up to just display the lockscreen on a double-tap of the button. (Which is fine, but seems an inferior solution to tapping anywhere on the display to do a wake as LG, HTC, and other phones do.) Bixby *cracks knuckles.* OK, let's talk about Samsung's intelligent assistant... thing. Bixby exists in three incarnations on the Galaxy S8 at this time. First, there is Bixby Home (Google Now). Then, there is Bixby Reminders (which is, well, reminders). And then we have Bixby Vision (Google Goggles). We'll talk about each of them, I guess. Bixby's banner feature, voice controls, is not available at the time of this review, and will supposedly launch here in the US later this spring. For now, then, all the Bixby button does is launch Bixby Home.    Bixby Home is the most involved of the three, so let's begin there. Bixby Home is a bit like someone took your Google Now feed and made it less useful. It displays recent photos you've taken, advertises themes on Samsung's Galaxy Apps store, suggests wallpapers, gives you unnecessarily large calendar event cards, displays random GIFs from giphy (why), gives you a list of your most frequently visited websites (if you use Samsung's browser), as well as your most frequently used apps. There's also weather, your step count (helpful), and news served from Flipboard (which you can remove entirely). Currently, Bixby home integrates with a few third-party apps, too. Spotify, Twitter, Uber, Giphy, Facebook, CNN, and Foursquare all can pipe in data to the Bixby Home app if they're installed on your device. Of note: Bixby Home by default can run from your lockscreen, though Samsung does disable cards that might contain personally identifying information like your contacts or calendar. Bixby Home does look kind of nice, so there's that, but I just don't see anybody using this. Google Now is helpful for the deep insights it has about your habits and interests based on the fact that Google knows an insanely creepy amount about what you do on the internet. Samsung will probably never be able to get that deep. Then, we've got Bixby Reminders. Bixby Reminders is exactly what it sounds like: you can set a reminder to do something, including based on a time or location. There are roughly, I don't know, a billion apps and services out there that do this much more robustly and with far more powerful features. I don't see any reason to care about Bixby Reminders unless you're a big fan of Bixby Home, which is where you will be able to find said Bixby Reminders. Finally, there's Bixby Vision. You use it by opening the camera app and pressing the Bixby Vision button. Right now, Bixby Vision can identify wine. I tried a bottle, it didn't work. Bixby Vision can also identify text for translation. That's kind of nice. Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. And it can read QR codes, because it's 2017 and we're still using those. So, yes, it really is just Google Goggles but kind of different (and worse?). You can probably safely ignore Bixby for now, but maybe voice commands will make it actually somewhat useful when they do arrive. Try not to hit the button accidentally, though - I'm doing it all the time and it's getting kind of annoying. Snap window Snap windows is an interesting attempt by Samsung to make Android's splitscreen functionality suck less when you're using it to watch video. Let's say you're watching something in YouTube but you also want to keep texting someone without interrupting your video. You could use Android's built-in splitscreening to do this, but every time you pop out the keyboard in the chat app, your video is going to get pushed around and interrupted and reload constantly. It's a bad experience, and kind of shows just what a sorry state multitasking really still is in on the platform.    Snap window is a band-aid, of sorts, on that problem. With your video player open and the video in view (in portrait mode), open the multitasking UI and the card for the video app should have a third icon to the left of the splitscreen button. Hit that, and you're given a crop interface. Move the rectangle over the area where the video is playing, adjust the size if necessary, and hit "done." At this point, the video will "pin" to the top of the screen, and the lower part of the interface becomes the app switcher. Pick an app, and you're off and running - the video won't move at all even if you pop out the keyboard, and plays back smoothly. I have no idea how this really works, but Samsung clearly understood that video was a pain point in the Android splitscreen experience, and this makes it much better. I can't say I'll use it, but given all that vertical screen space on the S8+, I'm sure someone wants to know about this. Snap window works with any app, of course, but video is the most obvious application. Dual audio Thanks to Bluetooth 5.0, the Galaxy S8 can transmit the same audio to two pairs of Bluetooth audio devices at once. This could be great for watching movies or listening to music on a plane together, for example. I tested it, and it works. Samsung does note that because you only get one volume slider to adjust on the phone, the output level to each connected Bluetooth device will probably vary, and you'll need to adjust the device volume for individual control. Still, it's pretty cool. Separate app sound This is another one I found digging around in Samsung's labyrinthine settings menu: a new feature called separate app sound. I know, this sounds boring, but hold on - it may actually solve a problem that's been bugging you for years. Streaming music over Bluetooth is convenient, but it does tend to come with a catch: your device can't play any other media audio when you're streaming music, because that'll pause the player app. So if you want to play a game or watch a video silently on your phone while you're streaming tunes to a Bluetooth speaker or headphones, you can't - there's only one media channel. This fixes that. Once separate app sound is enabled, you can select one app and make it the exclusive media audio provider to a connected Bluetooth device. So, if you want to make sure Play Music is coming through your Bluetooth speaker, pick the Play Music app and select the Bluetooth device, and only that app will be allowed to send media audio to that speaker while this setting is enabled. (Notification audio, unfortunately, is not blocked - that will still come through.) But, now you can open up YouTube, a game, or browse the web on your phone while Play Music is going without worrying about pausing your Bluetooth stream, as all other media audio will play directly through the device speaker instead. This is a pretty decent idea. Other changes I've got some smaller features and changes I discovered, and I'll list them out here. Fingerprint scanner can be set to pull down the notification shade and, from the home screen, to launch Samsung Pay by swiping up. Face unlock mode. Always-on display mode has some very slight aesthetic tweaks. That's really it. The software changes versus the current GraceUX OS on the GS7 and S7 edge are pretty minor. General UI (launcher, notifications, lockscreen, navigation keys) The notification tray is essentially unchanged from the current version of Samsung's skin running on a Galaxy S7, though the launcher is an all-new version of TouchWiz Home that uses a swipe-up (or down, actually) app drawer a la Pixel. Samsung has also implemented some kind of ape on launcher shortcuts, but they're not really launcher shortcuts - they're just a bunch of actions you can take on the icon. For example, you can multi-select icons in the launcher, remove a shortcut, sleep an app, uninstall it, or go to the info screen. It's kind of handy, really, but I'm not sure it could easily coexist with Android's app shortcuts - the list of items would get really long. In lieu of Google Now, the TouchWiz launcher has a pane for Bixby home to the left of the first homescreen. Yay.    Like me, you're probably going to toss off that stock launcher almost immediately, so I won't dive in too deep. It seems like a fine launcher as OEM launchers go, but if you want any kind of customization, you've still got to go third party. The recent apps menu is the same as you'll find on any up to date S7, and the lockscreen has seen a slight visual refresh, though still offers the same shortcuts for the dialer, Samsung Pay, and the camera app. Of note: Samsung takes a more conservative approach with whether or not it will stretch apps into "full-screen" mode on this new, longer display. There's an area in the settings menu where you can force toggle apps to display in the full UI space, as I've noticed many, even some Google apps, are not set to by default. I forced this on for all my apps and haven't had any issues, but your mileage may vary. Software: Opinion I really don't mind GraceUX. Samsung doesn't mess with stock Android too much these days from a strictly functional perspective. I don't like that I have to disable some things like Samsung's app sleeping, touch sounds, or navigation button order - but here's the thing: I can. There are very few things which I cannot change about the software experience on the Galaxy S8 that are genuine annoyances. Don't like the launcher? Throw on a new one. Don't care for Bixby? Ignore it. Almost every potential software negative on this phone is either easily replaced or simply kept out of sight and out of mind.    Throw on your own launcher, set up Samsung Pay, and try to ignore that you'll probably be seeing "7.0" on this screen for a while - that's my advice. Meanwhile, Samsung adds genuinely useful features like Samsung Pay, screen modes, its dual audio Bluetooth feature, game modes, fingerprint scanner gestures, face recognition, a system-level audio EQ, tons of various configuration options, and more all packaged in what is probably the most technologically advanced smartphone on sale right now. That's not small potatoes. The one sticking point for me, though, is the Android version. The Galaxy S8 ships with Android 7.0, already a version and change behind. Samsung seems to have no interest in changing its approach to platform updates, and that's disappointing. I guess we'll see how they handle things with the S8 and S8+, but I don't have my hopes up. Additionally, while performance is decent out of the gate, I really think we should be demanding more. "Almost as good as the Pixel" is not huge praise considering this phone runs a next-generation chipset and renders the OS at a fraction the resolution a Pixel does. These aren't small concerns for the enthusiast set, but I don't think they're at all fatal to the phones. They're just worth considering. Value In essence, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ retail for $750 and $850, respectively, here in the US. That's a chunk of change more than an LG G6, though that phone does only come with 32GB of storage and features an older chipset. I think that considering the advanced display, processor, and level of quality Samsung is delivering, the prices are totally justifiable. Now, that doesn't mean they're not expensive phones - they are. Really, really expensive phones. But the standard S8 to me is more the competitor to the G6 and Pixel XL, while the S8+ sort of stands on its own as a direct challenge to the iPhone 7 Plus. Many people may not find the size of the S8+ very practical - it really is quite tall. Samsung phones also mean a glut of accessory choices for things like cases, full compatibility with any US carrier (including advanced network features), and more attention from 3rd-party developers in terms of ensuring apps run as they should. These aren't trivial things, even if they may not often go into the traditional smartphone value assessment. Is there nearly $300 more hardware in a Galaxy S8 than a OnePlus 3T? Of course not. But that's not really the question anyone is seriously asking. I think Samsung is charging a pretty penny for the S8 and S8+, but I also think they're doing more to convince the average consumer than, say, Google, that the price of admission is actually worth it. Conclusion The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are great smartphones, I have no doubt of this. Are they great smartphones for everyone? That's a question that, as an Android enthusiast myself, I have a harder time sounding decisive answering. I really like the Infinity Display. I like the very good battery life. I don't mind GraceUX - it's fine! I like the cameras, I like the quality of the phone itself, and I like the new software navigation keys. I have a harder time accepting the update situation and the already-slightly-shaky performance. These things give me genuine pause. But if they don't concern you - and they may well not - it's hard to find truly major faults with these phones. Samsung has done an excellent job building upon and refining the formula that it... built upon and refined with the S7 and S7 edge. The S8+ is probably a little big for most people, but I like that Samsung is offering a "real" big phone in its mainstream lineup. And if you don't want a "big" phone, the standard S8 really is very manageable. Samsung has built two excellent smartphones with the S8 and S8+. We're awarding both the S8 and S8+ our editor's choice "Most Wanted" accolade as well. Whether or not that gets you excited really comes down to what you value in a phone. For me? I'm still pretty happy with my Pixel XL. But if I was shopping today, I'd give the S8, or the S8+, a long, hard look. Tags galaxy 8 review galaxy s8 review subscribe ...

David Ruddock Can you tell I was in a bit of time crunch? haha. Thanks again. Pete Smith Its the first GS8 review I came across so got my eyeballs, your effort was worth it! Marty Just for interest since you used Geekbench, my Honor 8 got this score. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4b179b912ffc406ee06b6dff18a2017929f27362c4f2d6b7945c1341904cf980.png Mark Whelan my Mate 9 scored 1859 single core 6474 multi-core I still think the battery life is going to be just average on these new Samsung phones on the Snapdragon chipset...I get a solid 36 hours out of my phone with 8 hrs screen time. S8+ will get 5 hours most likely on a 15 hr day...and badly needing the charger.... What's the point of a QHD screen if you ship it running 1080p? Marty My opinion is that Huawei's going to displace Samsung as the top Android OEM since they are making such good phones. iKon Agreed, Huawei are slowly climbing up, they already in top 3 and it won't take long to get past apple. Anon probably in just a year or 2 to overtake Apple. It will still take quite a while to displace Samsung. 4 years? Marty If Sammy keeps languishing with their mobile division, it won't take 4 years. Samsung's software, while brimming with features, just isn't good. The only software Sammy has put out that's above and beyond anything else in its class is an app: Samsung Internet Beta. Dubs816 lmaoooooo dickchao Yeah these guys are delusional lol Marty By the way, the resolution is selectable. I'm pretty sure the S8 wouldn't be locked to FHD. Steve McQueen Love my Mate 9. Getting 8-9 hours of SOT is pretty nice. And I love not having to worry about battery life even during a 20 hour day. Stu Would you recommend this phone? I'm thinking of grabbing it the next time it's on sale. Marty Absolutely. It's one of the best phones I've ever owned. It's gorgeous, superbly made, feels good in the hand and is probably the fastest phone I've used. The fingerprint scanner is amazingly quick. The phone works so well too. If you don't mind an Android phone more similar to an iPhone, this is it. The system pretty much looks more like an iPhone than any Android. But it doesn't lack features like an iPhone would. My opinion why the Honor 8 hasn't received the fanfare it deserves has to do with religious hatred of Apple and the iPhone by Android enthusiasts. They can be quite irrational. Anything that even hints of iOS is likely to be shunned no matter how good the device is. I got the 64GB blue one and have been smiling since. And get a Spigen case for it if you get one. The Spigen really enhances the beauty of the Honor 8 while protecting it. m477 I like iOS. I really don't like cheap copies of it, and some of the common chinese-OEM software solutions, like a pre-installed, intrusive cleaner. I hate bullshit like that. Marty I wouldn't call EMUI on the Honor 8 a cheap copy of iOS. But it sounds like you have a gripe against the Honor 8. m477 I'm just calling EMUI what it is. It's clearly meant to mimic iOS, and it has some very questionable design choices. I have nothing against Huawei's hardware, I own a P9 lite. Marty Yeah, well I don't see a problem with it. It isn't iOS. It definitely runs quick. Smoothest, fastest Android yet. m477 My problem it's that I find it ugly to look at, compared to other interface, and I really don't like that it tries so hard to mimic iOS. To each their own. Marty Like how Samsung tries so hard to copy the iPhone. But, that's how it goes... Marty You know something? I used to listen to people like you about the Honor 8 before I finally decided to do an impulse buy and get one. Things that people like you say kept me from taking a chance on it. I'm glad I did an impulse buy because it turns out to be one of the best phones I've ever owned. It isn't nearly like what people like you say about it. I've already said that Android enthusiasts raise objection to the Honor 8 for whatever reasons, but the general public will love this device because it is that good. All people have to do is disregard the "Android enthusiast" rhetoric about it and give it a go. D13H4RD2L1V3 EMUI 5 is pretty good. Tried it on a Mate 9 along with its Pro variant and it does zip past screens without effort. Sure, its aesthetics are questionable but it is much improved. m477 Good for you. I'm not an Android enthusiast as much as a tech enthusiast. My daily driver is an iPhone, and I've tried most of the various Android UIs (even ColorOS and MIUI). In my opinion EMUI design wise is one of the most derivative. I don't like the fact that is a copy mostly because it seems to be screaming "I want to be an iPhone but I'm not". It got much better with the fifth version, and it will not get in your way (most of the time, at least). It's obviously still Android under the hood. Most Huawei phones are overall good, but you can't deny that software design is not their forte. A normal user will be fine with that. I personally just don't like copycats. Marty Comparing EMUI to Touchwiz, I'd say Huawei is an expert on software. Meaning EMUI is way better than Samsung's junky software. My Honor 8...the software experience...feels refined and high quality compared to many other Android systems. If anyone wants the truth about it, just give an Honor 8 a try. Update it to EMUI 5/Android 7 and use it daily. It's impressive. This is coming from someone who has a great many phones and has experienced many more. I can list all the phones I've owned and have used and this Honor 8 is the finest of them. m477 The hate on Touchwiz/GraceUX is a little more than a meme right now. Design wise it's not that bad, actually. Every modern, highly specced phone is a good phone (with a few exceptions), and will be "impressive" in daily usage. It's mostly a matter of preference. Marty Heh...so if someone who has a significant number of modern devices sees one of them stand out as impressive, it means nothing? Like you say, "to each, their own". Michaels_28 EMUI = Spyware. I tossed out my Honor 8. It was a good phone for the price I paid ($350 with a promo) but if I had to do it again I would avoid it. Having said that, the reason why Huawei is not selling their affordable phones like hotcakes in the U.S. is not because of irrational hatred. It's because of 1) national security interest, and 2) patents. If you remember the length Apple went after Samsung because of "rectangles with rounded corners," then you should be able to picture the legal barrier Huawei (or anyone really) is facing. Marty If the government was concerned about national security, Obama would never have been president. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I like MIUI. It's very iPhoneish. m477 If you can stand EMUI, which is a cheap copy of the iPhone's interface, and some of the crappy software solutions, it's a good phone. Cakefish Galaxy S7 w/Exynos 8890 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d012918ef89a330af9de9ee732fbd0c60a69cebc2441f666b62a620328a3c72c.png MJ "...already-slightly-shaky performance." LOL Someday Samsung, someday. I really like look of the phone but the fingerprint scanner location (and shape) is really tragic and a no go. Toss3 Pretty sure that's just the 835 slowing things down, as the exynos version I tried was buttery smooth (smoother than my tweaked exynos S7). There are always going to be some slowdowns, but in the case of the S-series most of it can be linked back to the Snapdragon SoCs. David Ruddock Plenty of OEMs make Snapdragon chips run perfectly smooth. It says far more about Samsung than it does Qualcomm. Toss3 Didn't mean to make it sound like there is anything wrong with Snapdragon SoCs; they just aren't a priority over at Samsung and if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version. Samsung is definitely to blame, but they do offer an alternative and it's always better to let people know that the Exynos version is the one to get. MJ The international version is not really an option in the US for most people. Warranty, Samsung Pay (that fixed yet?), and some type of payment plan are all big things. ericshmerick No wifi calling, no gogo pass functionality (on T-Mo). likurges who cares about the US? america is falling apart MJ Yeah, it's just horrible here so don't believe anything you hear and certainly don't waste your time immigrating here. likurges believe me, the us is towards the bottom of my list of countries that I'd want to migrate to. and now that you hurt my feeling I'm going to get them checked for free because you know .. single payer healthcare is a thing in the modern world MJ Dude, why do you keep advertising on the Internet how bad it in the US? I wouldn't want my fellow citizens to figure it out also thus ruining your future increases in elbow room in your own country. Worse, you could end up a out terrorist watchlist and then Donald drone strikes your ass. I wouldn't take the chance man! Single payer? Sweet! That's almost worth exchanging for having any real professional sports. I am BLOCKING you now. All bets in on if the troll responds again! likurges dude freedom of speech, have you ever heard of it? blocking people you don't like makes you similar to The Donald whispy_snippet "if you want a smooth experience, you need to get the international version" ...you need to get a different phone all together. MJ What? No... tu3218 Just use google smart Lock. I rarely need to use my fingerprint scanner on my S7 edge because of this. MJ I rarely use my phone at home and don't have a smartwatch so Smart Lock is of limited use to me. The fingerprint scanner is the best option for me and I am not buying the S8 so it doesn't really matter. tu3218 On body detection...this doesn't just apply to the s8. It's any phone. Just in case you were unaware of that feature. I know I always forget about that one. S8 does the best of everything besides the fingerprint scanner. Very easy to look over. m477 Is not easy to look over. Even budget phones have nailed the fingerprint reader. It's unacceptable that it sucks on a flagship. tu3218 I agree. Last minute terrible decision. It helps knowing that. Doesn't make it right though. TBD how bad it is when I get my s8. Smart Lock helps though. Rick Atherton it might just be me but every phone I've used the on body detection the phone always does stuff in my pocket so i always turn it off Drakenoid I use Gravity Screen instead of that, works far better. Scott It sucks they couldn't figure out how to put in under the display as they clearly wished they could. I just hope Apple has the same issue, or Samsung will have some serious egg on their face come iPhone time. MJ While the under the display fingerprint scanner would be cool tech I am not sure about having a permanent fingerprint smudge on my screen. LOL whispy_snippet A fingerprint sensor under the display makes perfect sense. I can't wait until every phone can do it well. MJ A fingerprint sensor under the display would be cool but NOT any more practical (I would argue LESS practical) than a sensor on the back (and less costly to implement). whispy_snippet Having owned a Pixel since launch I'd have to say I disagree. I love my phone. I think the Pixel is such a well rounded experience. But the one area I really think could be better is the fingerprint sensor placement. Sure, it's great when it's in my hand. But it's almost always on a desk in front of me - just like right now. If I want to quickly check something, I need to pick it up to use the fingerprint sensor or leave it on the table and swipe in my pattern. Sucky. If the fingerprint sensor was on the front this issue would be eliminated immediately. I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake - and I guess I can sorta understand this given Apple kicks up such a huge song and dance the moment anyone tries to do anything coming close to their approach. But fuck it. Just put it on the front and fight them I say. MJ A Pixel XL owner since launch myself. The fingerprint sensor is quick and accurate and my finger slides into place naturally. What is there not to like? I never could understand "the phone on the desk argument". Incoming text and call information shows right up on the lock screen. I can just double tab and put in my pin if really need to do interact but I would pick it up and use the fingerprint scanner just like any other time I use my phone. I mostly use my phone when on the go anyway which means it is in my pocket and a rear sensor works much better (and natural) than the front sensor on my former HTC 10 ever did. "I feel like putting fingerprint sensors on the back is just a way of being different to Apple for different's sake...". Huh? No... Again, I would argue a sensor on back just makes more sense and in the case of Google they have always used on-screen buttons so a single fingerprint reader on the front would just look stupid (aka see Moto) and also the Nexus 6P/5X had front facing speakers so the sensor had to go on the back. whispy_snippet The thing is, double tap to wake doesn't work reliably. It works maybe 75% of the time. Not bad, but when it lets you down it grates. In fact the same goes for Google's screen off voice unlock - it works maybe 60% of the time and this REALLY annoys me... but I digress. The fingerprint scanner on the back is great when it's in your hand but annoying when it's on a desk. A fingerprint scanner on the front is good in your hand and good on a desk. Ultimately, I think I'd prefer a consistently good user experience. I think a fingerprint sensor behind the display will be the end goal for every phone maker. In a couple of years I reckon everyone will be doing it. Bryan Breguet Fingerprint sensor on the back makes no sense to me and is an automatic dealbreaker. I truly hate it. Also, really, you don't understand the argument of when the phone is on your desk? Surely you are trolling. MJ I think people who think they can't use their phone because it's sitting on a desk and it has rear fingerprint scanner are trolling. Alejandro You can double tap the screen to read the notifications...No need to unlock the phone with the fingerprint sensor. Bryan Breguet You can double tap to read the notification, not the full email or even picture or whatever. Are you guys really that thick that you are trying to use this argument? You'll ultimately need to unlock the phone and therefore it means you won't use the fingerprint almost half the time. Scott You mean on your touchscreen? MJ Yes. whispy_snippet On the one hand, yes. I expect Apple will get the fingerprint scanner under the display right for their upcoming flagship. On the other hand if Apple comes out with a minimal bezel, curved edge display it's going to be a special moment for Samsung. Finally, Samsung will be able to say outright "You copied US, Apple" and they'll be right. m477 You hope that a competing product has some issue and the advanced technology that everyone want's will not be ready, so Samsung's sells won't be hindered? Do you own Samsung stocks or something? Scott Hell yeah I want the iPhone to faceplant. Liam Bulkley I know the "2.5D" (are they still calling it that?) is, thus far, largely a gimmick, and effectively reduces the reading width due to distortions, but the front of the s8/+ looks gorgeous. All that glass..... Nope. Bad! Metal would be better, but a nice high quality plastic would be best. Is Samsung in the pocket of Big Glass? enoch861 I've switched my S7 Edge between UHD and HD and I've never really noticed a battery life difference between the two. My battery has been overall atrocious for some reason, but I can't find the perpetrator. Overall I'm not sure if I'll be upgrading even though the S8+ looks quite attractive. illregal Samsung cheap garbage mainstream phones for the followers TechGuy22 LOL illregal funny because it's true. 2kool4skool ...that will sell millions. illregal yeah, there are walmarts all over the place as well. Quantity sold is not a factor of quality. 2kool4skool Then what is the factor of quality in this case? Amount of raging fanboys in tech forums? Flagships cost a lot these days. The fact that tens of millions of people trust their hard earned money with Samsung devices might say something about its quality. illregal It actually says something about their inability to think for themselves. Their inability to know what the difference between devices is in the first place. Most people call android devices droids. or think samsung is the only company that even makes android devices. You're giving people to much credit. They are much more dumb than you assume. Plus they saw 4 commercials for samsung crap during their episode of dancing with the stars, so it has to be good right!?? 2kool4skool And how do you think Samsung able to get all over the place in the first place? Samsung mobile division also start with with a humble beginning like every other android oem company. Htc arguably was a bigger player in early android days. But Samsung has consistently able to give what people want until today, that's why it keeps growing and expanding and now you can see 4 commercial about it during episodes of dancing with the stars. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It's called capitalism. And it works most of the time. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yes quantity is an indicator of quality. McDonald's doesn't make the best quality food, but they sell the most because it's the best and most consistent quality fast food. I say that as someone who would never eat there, too. You don't compare McDonald's to Ruth's Chris, because they're not in the same category. The S8 and S8+ will sell gazillions because they're the best quality flagship phones. illregal You just contradicted yourself. They will sell gazillions because they are all over the place, and people are bombarded with ads, and don't know any better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Debating with you is a waste of time, but McDonald's is all over the place because people like the food. If nobody liked it, they couldn't open so many locations. Consumers love Samsung phones. Deal. illregal I know what people love.. Problem is I have to support their poor choices. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Well, I don't have to support your idiotic comments. You're blocked now. Suicide_Note Cheap? Nope. Garbage? Nope. Mainstream? Yes, but that's what happens when you sell tens of millions of devices. XDAMM Excuse me while I enjoy my gorgeously designed phone with the best display and top tier cameras, performance and battery life. Samsung's S series are indeed mainstream but they're not cheap and they are definitely not garbage. Their software could always improve and they could release major Android versions faster but their hardware game is just too strong and at least their software is usually stable and reliable (unlike previous Nexus phones and the Pixel which continue to be plagued by Bluetooth issues even months after release). I'd love having a consistent 60fps UI like the Pixel does but I won't sacrifice other software additions and considerably better hardware just for smoothness. illregal sweet pink display yo. sweet top tier, meaning not as good as some cameras yo. Performance, yo.. Enjoy your stutters. and average battery life. Cat Astrophy Enjoy your pocket explosive XDAMM Really? That was funny and relevant when the Note 7 was confirmed of having that issue but not anymore. If you think about it every battery powered device is a potential hazard but we don't usually worry about our Bluetooth headphones or laptops exploding even though that happens often. A few S8 will likely combust because statistically speaking it's nearly impossible to make a perfect phone, but its quite unlikely for that to become a widespread issue again. Jumanji! Be honest - do you work for Saygus? Middlefinger Compared to who? Google? Its phones are total junk, riddled with hardware and software faults, and over priced. TechGuy22 i'm buying S8+ used probably the exynos version so i can put AOSP on it Bewear That would have been considered a crazy idea some years ago. Time sure changes everything! 2kool4skool Always go with exynos version. Smother and more battery life. The only drawback is a bit weaker gpu than SD version, but meh, we're not going to play crysis on it anyway. TechGuy22 yeah i can't be with a locked down phone. Tech Writer The GPU is more powerful on exynos this time around. Toss3 "I would seriously worry about breaking this phone if I bought it. There is so much glass - Samsung phones essentially require cases." - Not sure I agree as the glass is pretty tough if the S7/S7 Edge are anything to go by. Only thing I didn't like about the S8 is the curvature on the front glass, as it is just too much and makes the display look distorted. Middlefinger I agree, plus the glass can be changed, whereas a metal unibody cant (as easily) and dents/ scratches much more easily. Ammar I just cannot decide between this and the Pixel XL. S8 is just a sultry, almost exotic looking device. But despite what the reviews will say, I doubt the performance and battery will be as consistent. jonathan If you want consistent performance and timely updates go for the pixel or wait for the next pixel, if you want a sexy device go with the S8. Me myself I always prefer the device with consitant performance and timely updates XDAMM I care more about a fast and responsive UI, fast app opening and switching and good gaming performance than 60FPS UI. Because of this, the better display, cameras, ingress protection rating, iris scanner, wireless charging and 64GB of (faster) storage by default there is just no comparison and I'll get the S8. The Pixel is an interesting proposition but it's not sold officially in my country and they have so many Bluetooth and battery related issues they're just not worth the asking price and trouble IMO. Rod http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif P. Sherman Bluetooth on Pixels are damn near UNUSABLE since launch. The fingerprint reader was rendered UNUSABLE in 7.1.2. Lags here and there are infinitely more acceptable than hardware failures, which apparently the Pixel is very good at. Rod I don't think inconsistent performance is acceptable on a > 720 bucks device. P. Sherman But it's still better than NON-PERFORMANCE. 2kool4skool The only thing I don't like from this otherwise great devices is the extra "Bixby" button. It kinda mess up the seamlessness of the device a little bit. But I don't think it's would be a significant upgrade from s7 edge, but I really like where Samsung is heading with these new devices, though. I'll wait for the next iteration, if the rumors are true, next galaxy s would probably feature an under-screen fingerprint scanner. It would make the device evn more seamless, they could get rid the home button entirely. One could only hope. Ome Dries Are the screenshots on the S8 square? That means it renders pixels the display can't even show, imagine how much performance & battery life they could've gained 2kool4skool Considering it renders 4262400 pixels by default, I don't think few pixels on the corners would make that much of a difference. create812 Stock Android or bust. Also, what's the deal with Project Fi? Can any phone with the proper radios take advantage of a Project Fi SIM, or does Goog only allow "approved" phones? Marty Only Nexii and the Pixels. create812 I think I saw a video early in the Project Fi days of a Samsung phone having a Fi SIM in it, and it partially worked (only worked with one of the carriers). I'm wondering what the current status of this is. Can someone pop a Fi SIM into their S8 and figure out what happens? Max Apparently we can also include now Nokia phones. raazman Can't wait to see what they're gonna do. OligarchyAmbulance Nokias are supposed to work on Fi? Max Not at the moment, but the rumor mill is that they want to be "the next Nexus" so depending on their relationship with Google that could be the case in the future. Just a guess based on rumors so take it with a grain of salt. FeelThePoveR Or OnePlus. (Or custom roms in my case) Roy No. OnePlus tow don't got any nougat Defenestratus What is stock android these days? I don't even know. EvilHowl AOSP Eric Abreu You can use a Project Fi sim card with other phones, but you'll only have access to the T-Mobile network. I think that you'll also need to activate the sim card on a Nexus or Pixel device before moving it to a non-Google device 2kool4skool "Stock Android or bust." You're missing out so many great phones out there. raazman What's so great about them? Mike Limited bezels is a good start. Realistically, to keep this short it would be more what's so great about stock phones: 1. Fast Updates 2. Quicker UI 3. ........ That's about it. raazman Quicker UI? I beg to differ. Fast updates? Um what? Not even remotely close. Mike You need to read the entire comment to get what I'm saying. Unless you are, in fact, saying that Samsung's phones will get quicker updates than Pixel phones. raazman Oh, oops. I replied to 2kool4skool. I already know Google's Nexus Pixels are better in both regards. Mike And that's also where it ends in terms of what does stock offer over other Android phones. raazman Opinions I guess, because I differ on that stance. Mike Other than the two things I named, name something stock Android does better than a phone Samsung/LG released. FeelThePoveR Customizability which is the main point of android I guess. Middlefinger Whos updates? Googles or Samsungs? Recent events should tell you that rushing to install whatever Google pushes out isnt always a good thing. 2kool4skool They don't have endless problems like pixel and pixel xl for a start. raazman Ummm...you sure buddy? LG? Samsung TouchWiz? Which phones are we talking about here? And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced. Mike Ah, the good old "My ____ is working fine so obviously there's no issues at all". Hearing this always makes me appreciate what we've become. raazman I just commented saying I've seen this trend since the S3 among friends and family, calm down. Mike "And my Pixel XL has not had a problem yet. So I'm not convinced." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Nobody who owns a Pixel XL has a problem with it. Except those who do. 2kool4skool I don't know man, I tend to believe tech sites like this more than the trend among your friends and family. And this site talks a lot about pixel problems. The last one was 2 days ago about some pixels losing fingerprint scanner functionality after latest update, look it up. raazman How about note 7 explosions? TouchWiz lag? And now it seems like the S8 screen has color issues. 2kool4skool Here we go again with "my phone might have a lot of problems, but at least it doesn't explode" argument. Note 7 is dead, and people get their money back, so it literally cost people 0$. How much pixel cost? 800$? Stop comparing 0$ phone to 800$ one. raazman Haha you're delusional if you think the galaxies don't have issues. 2kool4skool I never think or said that. All phones have issues including galaxies. But it's the first time I see devices (pixel and pixel xl) with so much problems that continously popped up and being featured on Android sites for almost every two weeks. Roy Because everybody want to hear about Pixel so even it's a little bunch of users let's make a headlight. Rod Actually, many people lost $ due to cases and other accessories not being refunded. Middlefinger Never seem this mythical lag, the Note was bad, but a one off, this screen colour seems like a first batch issue like all devices have. The Pixel is just riddled with faults even the newest batch. Remember the N5 was redesigned because the first run was so poor, the N7 had terrible screen quality problems and slow NAND, HTCs have had multiple camera issues, the iPhone also had screen issues, Sony had battery issues. Its common. Rod How about this one? http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Middlefinger Right, first release software (or even pre-release). Ive seen just as bad on a Nexus at release, if not worse. My Samsungs have never exhibited anything like that. Rod I've had 3 Nexus, and never saw anything like that either. Middlefinger Ive had 5, all had some lag, I returned 2 because they were poor quality. Roy Not really he was talking also about 6p and shocking it's smooth as ever. Most of the users don't have this problems. Middlefinger Samsung sell hundreds of millions of phones, Google has sold about 12 Pixels.. OK an exaggeration, but the point remains. If you sell more, a LOT LOT more, then problems seem more common, but as a percentage they arent. 2kool4skool And out of 12 pixels sold, 9 have problems. 9/12, needs more bugs. - IGN Rashad Actually, 9/12=.75 7.5 = Good -IGN Roy Not really. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Correction: HTC has shipped about 2 million Pixels and Pixel XLs since launch 6 months ago. Samsung has 20 million S8/S8+ phones ready for launch. Middlefinger and will sell more than 2 million in the first day. Nexus/pixel sales have always been poor, just like the product. Roy My 6p also no problem. illregal Samsungs have more hardware and software issues than everyone else combined. raazman Since the S3, yes this is what I've personally seen among friends and family. 2kool4skool Lol, who are we kidding here? You can find bunch of articles about pixel problems on this site. Last article I read was 2 days ago about some pixels lost ability to set up fingerprint scanner after latest update. Roy Haha but it isn't true my 6p rocking with a great fingerprint scanner. Middlefinger I think the Pixel has that crown now. I have had zero problems with any of my Samsungs, ive returned all my Nexus devices due to faults and poor quality. create812 I know, but stock Android, fast updates, and compatibility with Fi are my top priorities. Roy Not really. Not looking for junk. Defenestratus Picking up my S8+ on Friday - despite Bixby stupidity. I'm praying that the community figures out how to disable it. I currently have a Nexus 6P that constantly infuriates me. The pixel was not a value proposition that I was convinced was worth it - and I doubt the Pixel 2 will be either if they stick with the old, tired form factors and tiny screen sizes. So S8+ is what I'm left with. We'll see if it leads to user angst or not. I'm trying my best to be optimistic. Jay If it can be disabled by a package disabler, I'll be happy. I think. catalysto Early rumors say Pixel 2 will have a much smaller bezel like the other phones coming out this generation. I wouldn't make any assumptions yet. 2kool4skool If Google wanted smaller bezel for their pixel 2, they gonna need to pick some company other than Htc to do their devices. Htc simply can't manufacture a phone with small bezel or water resistant because their manufacturing process is outdated. catalysto Who says Google won't do that? 2kool4skool I never said, that. In fact, I think It would be cool if they go with Motorola this year. illregal their manufacturing process isn't outdated. They just care. They mill out unibody designs from a solid block. Which takes time and effort. Unlike samsung, who just stamps out garbage, quantity quantity quantity. 2kool4skool Have you seen their latest device, htc u? It's enormous in size, but only has 3000mah battery. It's thick af, yet it still has a very protuding camera. It doesn't even have audio jack, water resistance, and wireless charging yet yet it still cost an arm and leg. If that's what you mean by care, I can't imagine how much shittier their device would be if they made if without care. Jay There might be a few more compromises here than I originally thought but it's too late to cancel my pre-order. Now I don't know whether I should even bother. 😕 Thanks for this uncertainty now, David. (Partially kidding..) 4Ui812 I see the red tint in most pics. AC has a story about that problem with some phones in Korea . Is the bootloader locked down like with the S7E ? http://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-s8-displays-red-discoloration-764692/ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2550b567c5a3bd243534cc66e251d0edbb770bd373e83a7961b5012e2e49c482.jpg Marty Holy shit! The HTC S8. 2kool4skool Probably just some devices with miscalibrated screen, for now can be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. But they'll probably fix it via OTA later. Samsung introduced new screen calibration setting on nougat, you can set the intensity of each of RGB pixels to meet your desired color balance. Here's setting screenshot on my s7 edge. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png illregal You can't fix poor screen quality with an OTA. If you lower a setting to calibrate a device via an update. The ones without the issue will then be more off. It's not a matter of adjustments, its a matter of poor qc and not yielding consistent products. 2kool4skool How it's "poor screen quality"? It's not hardware problem. Just some minor adjustments via OTA, and it will be fixed. If you're asking how they're gonna fix it without ruining other devices, the answer is the same way Google fixes pixels with Bluetooth problem without ruining the ones that's function just fine. It's software problem, they're gonna figure something out. FeelThePoveR It may as well be a hardware problem, because why couldn't it be? 2kool4skool I highly doubt that, because as I said before the problem can simply be solved by lowering red pixel intensity in setting. Galaxy s screens has always feature calibration setting as a feature, probably it's just some sloppy written code messing up with the setting. And if that's the case, it would be fixable via OTA. Take my answer with a grain of salt, though. Because we still need confirmation from Samsung if that's indeed the case. This is merely the logical answer I can think of for this problem. catalysto Is calibration the problem? Because software cannot calibrate a screen without being able to see it. So no, an OTA would not be able to fix that. The screen must be calibrated at the factory. 2kool4skool Software doesn't necessarily needs to see the screen in this case. Samsung can get their hands on the affected device, tweak it and figure which screen batch affected, and send tweaked software to all devices via OTA. Your comment does make sense, though. Unless Samsung can figure out which devices affected and need for fix, users probably will have to resort to the last option, go to setting and tweak it themselves manually. illregal what I'm saying is.. You can't push out an ota to adjust the screen calibration. Because how is that OTA gonna pick n choose which ones need the adjustment and which ones don't. It's a hardware issue. Samsung makes garbage. 2kool4skool They don't necessarily have to send out an OTA that needs to pick which ones need adjustment and which ones don't. They can just send an OTA that works for both as intended. But whatever, you can believe what you want to. I merely stated what I think a logical answer for this problem. Middlefinger You can if its due to a setting. HTC managed to get rid of a huge red blob in the middle of the HD2 camera with an update. Plenty, like you, assumed it was a hardware fault. Rod It's not. https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg Rod The problem is, if those devices already have those values maxed out. 2kool4skool Actually, rather than fixed values, these RGB settings act more like percentage values. Meaning you can set them lower and it wouldn't make a difference unless one value is bigger than another. It's hard to describe but I'll include another screenshot. The result would be the same even if you lower those values as long as it's on the same level. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2788b47dbae19707db41c131c25f545abf51fe7ac923621517261397b1c4390b.png same as https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/78c23a79995e1f76d6daf742ac05cc0f8893b2871459eeb4cdfec41c6eef2872.png Rod Yeah, I know. That value was arbitrary. Though now I'd like to know from Ruddock himself what were the default values in his review unit. 2kool4skool Yeah, and apparently some screens might interpret those values differently / inaccurately, hence the problem. And if that's correct, an OTA fix should be logically possible. That's all what I was saying. Rod I hope so. But all OLED panels I've seen to this date, has screen tint of some color. Either red or green. 2kool4skool Can't deny that. Some OLED panels, especially the lower end ones are struggling to produce a balanced color, it's usually most noticeable while viewing white color. That's why IPS screens usually produce better whites than oleds. But oleds produce deeper black than IPS. In the end, each have strength and weaknesses. Get what you prefer. Rod Yeah. I, for one, prefer pure white. Can't stand the reddish whites on the S8 reviewed here. C Lo Who doesn't enjoy buying a $900 device and then having to fix it yourself. Sounds like a swell situation to me. /s 2kool4skool Nobody said that. It sucks that this problem happens. We're just discussing possible fix for it, not trying to disregard the problem itself. Rod Oh boy..... https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg 2kool4skool You really don't get it, do you? That's why I said it's miscalibrated. Although both of those devices have the same RGB values, the affected device read and interpret those values incorrectly. On affected device, you need to lower the Red value to something like this in order to make the red tint disappear. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5ae0be301ee03f23d53f275a783d6c59be4e7147070152bed2c42ae2ce2551fe.png These articles might explain it better that I do. If you're interested. http://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-clears-air-red-tinted-galaxy-s8-displays https://www.androidheadlines.com/2017/04/galaxy-s8s-display-reddish-tint-korean-consumers-say.html Rod Then why does the one with RED component at zero, still has red tint all over? Rod Explain this, then. https://i.imgur.com/a1e3dTw.jpg Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Pinkgate. Rod https://www.cnet.com/news/some-samsung-galaxy-s8-phones-ship-with-red-tinted-screens/ https://cnet4.cbsistatic.com/img/wdpXe9TcHb700WdDoryWeeQRgBc=/2017/04/18/20260318-f9bb-43e3-8a46-f198a6b88ccf/capture.png Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ My son just got his S8+ and the white is white as snow. The LG G6 has a very distinct blue tint. Funny how there are no articles about that. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b8c2b9fbef728965ff12187f4f2d10a00f0a4b70842c6075f1655f26f156ae75.png 4Ui812 Maybe that's part of the manufacturing process , I don't know. But I know not all S8's have the Red tint issue , therefore it's called a defect. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Maybe it is a defect, I don't know. If I got a pink one, I'd return it. I wouldn't accept a software update. I'm also wondering if at least some of the people who think they have pink displays simply have the blue filter turned on. 4Ui812 The blue filter shouldn't be causing that sort of issue. Hell the blue filter on my s7e doesn't make that much of a difference. Badelhas A phone made entirely out of glass? lol. No, thanks. 4Ui812 There are metal parts inside 😁 Badelhas That's why it's not transparent, then! 😊 m477 I can't say I actually care the phone renders in 1080p by default, I'll take the extra battery life. Tests have demonstrated that using lower then native resolutions has no appreciable benefit to the battery. What you gain is a more stable FPS count. dabug91 Exactly, there may be a slight difference if you're constantly playing games, but regardless of whether you're in 1080p or 1440p mode, every single one of those pixels on the screen is still turned on and using the same amount of power other than pure black. makapav You will only recover energy saved on CPU and GPU cycles that would otherwise have been used for rendering those extra pixels. Morten Ulv Wont those just be used at giving you higher FPS? Either way, I guess the point was that the difference is negligible. Abhishek Saral So like if I run a 4K XPS 15 on 1080P resolution. Will I see a battery improvement? Tech Writer Not much at all. On the other hand, if you get the 1080p XPS 15, it will last much longer. Most of the higher power consumption of higher res screens comes from the panel itself. Changing render resolution doesn't change this, unless you do native res 3D rendering or play games. David Ruddock Alright, that may well be. I'll adjust to "performance." D13H4RD2L1V3 Probably the only savings you'd get is from the processor not needing to drive a lot more pixels. It's usually quite minimal at best, imperceptibly so at worst. Rod 1080p vs 1440p when drawing 2D is a non-issue, actually. Liam Bulkley "...one would expect, but that turns out not to be the case on this device" :-D godutch It's less calculations though, gpu is less used and can clock lower m477 The impact of the GPU on the battery is very, very small, unless graphically intensive games are in use. End even then, the difference between 1440p and 1080p is not that big. DanSan I pre-ordered the GS8+. Coming from the Nexus 6, this seemed to be my best option even after playing with both phones extensively the day after they were announced. I'm going to miss my Nexus experience but honestly I'm tired of being a beta tester for Googles software. Past couple of months my N6 has been almost useless at times, freezing doing basic tasks. I don't care about locked bootloaders or rooting anymore, I just want to be able to tweak a few things to my liking and have a phone that just.... works. Max If you're picky then there's a very high chance that you will regret moving to a Samsung phone if you are looking for "a phone that just... works". Samsung software has many annoyances for people accustomed to the Google Android experience. demarcmj This. Every time I try to help a family member with their galaxy device I get really frustrated trying to figure out how the damn thing works. DanSan I assume thats because you're going from stock android to Samsung experience, I can understand the confusion Zsolt V And hundreds of millions of people have no such problems. Interesting. DanSan Totally agree with you but doing simple things now are a pain for me. I just want to unlock it and take a picture or text somebody. easy and simple. catalysto Not sure what the problem is on yours. Mine can open the camera instantly with a power button double-press. DanSan That may be true, time will tell. I have an iPhone 6S as a work device, I end up using that because my Nexus 6 has become so bad. Even after a factory wipe. I will take any kind of change Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ We have two iPhone 6S phones in our family. They both "just work" unless there's an iOS update waiting. After updating, they both "just work" again. I have to wonder if some of the apps update before the OS does, and that's why the problems occur when the update hasn't yet been applied. Just a guess. Suhas I switched to S6 Edge+ eighteen months ago from a N5 after being a loyal Nexus user since the Galaxy Nexus. Surprisingly, it was the best decision ever. Back in the day I used to root, flash custom ROMs and tinker with the phone a lot which I ain't bothered to do so anymore. Also the Nexus kept failing on me in certain areas (Bluetooth, memory leaks, sub-par speakers, camera, battery etc.) and I got fed up. The S6 Edge+ was worth the price and it has been an amazing phone. Can't wait to get my hands on the S8! Switch and you will not regret. DanSan I'm pumped but definitely going to be a learning curve when it comes to samsung settings and what not. But i think we were in the same boat, just tired of tweaking and tinkering to get it to do what i want. Even now I have to make excuses for how bad my phone is, granted its a few years old but I'm over it. Gjorgi Lazarovski well you made the wrong choice going with a Samsung device, since "nothing" works on them. You always get the weirdest bug reports from Samsung users. They have issues with a bunch of apps. 2kool4skool Lol if you're talking about bugs, look no further than pixel and pixel xl. You can find bunch of articles about problems with these devices on this site. You have problems ranging from Bluetooth issue, camera halo / lens flare, dodgy connection, fingerprint issue, etc etc, I lost track. Do your research. Gjorgi Lazarovski I was talking about apps compatibility, but yeah Rod Correct. https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/3xgxg2/why_is_there_so_much_hate_against_samsung/ Rod Welcome aboard. http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif Roy My 6p doing the best job until today and still rocking, very smooth and very consist software. Just love it. Heiro78 i never planned on using the fingerprint sensor so thats not an issue.

EvilHowl Yes, it works Heiro78 Cool thanks, i assume you're talking about the double press on the home for the camera shortcut. EvilHowl Yep Chippah Peckas Fresh360 So. Many. WORDS! I LOVE IT! zooster Gemme an on screen fingerprint scanner, a 18:9 screen (not 18,5:9, too long), shave off upper and bottom bezel by some millimeter more, add stereo speakers, dual camera, quick charge 4 and a battery somewhat larger... Then I'll but it ☺️ plexabyte What is this, the Turing Cadenza? Jaime does anybody know if the galaxy s8 has the At&t logo on the back? can't find any image of it (which is great!), but I don't want to be disappointed when my phone arrives with an ugly logo on it's back. wests It does not. The Rebrand Nation From laggy touchwiz 5 of the galaxy s5 to near perfect smasung experience 8.1 Not bad for 4 years FeelThePoveR Considering that OnePlus rose from nothing to the company they are today in 4 years and the fact that Samsung is supposed to be the top player with highest development budget of all, it's pretty bad. Bob Marley They didn't rise from nothing. They have the funding and resources of Oppo, a major smartphone player, behind their back. FeelThePoveR They had to build their "brand" from nothing and their success is impressive, becouse at least where I live people prefer to buy things from known brands even if it's not the best bang for buck, as they don't trust the newcomers. Middlefinger But Oneplus phones still have boatloads of issues and very dubious quality, both hardware and software. FeelThePoveR Boatloads of issues? I wouldn't say so, every device has it's quirks but OnePlus is really good at listening to the community and fixing them. Dubious quality? 1+3 and 1+3T are the fastest Snapdragon 820 and 821 devices ever for half of the price of other comperable devices so what about that is so dubious? Maybe camera is not a top notch one but it's good anyway, certainly good enough for the price. Middlefinger Build quality, and reliability is the problem. I'm a regional manager for a electronics service/retail company, we get a lot back, they just aren't made very well. FeelThePoveR Well I've seen a couple from the inside and they seemed really neatly designed/put together and besides even phones from the "old players" could cause more trouble then 1+ ones i.e. LG with its loose components on the motherboard causing bootlops, Samsung Note 7 burning battery or my oldy HTC M7 purple camera tint issue. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ From feature-free stock Android to Nougat with split screen. Not bad for 4 years. Middlefinger Really it was done in 1 year. The S5 wasnt good, but the S6 was in a different league. The S7 and S8 have just been refinements really. Rod Near perfect? http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Nishant i guess this would be a great upgrade from my Galaxy S3!!! :) Cat Astrophy So what you're saying...is that this phone is THE BOMB? Typical Samsung. I like my phones non-explodey. My name is…. biased, as always. You call this phone pricey? Then what is Pixel? DanSan There is a difference between being pricey for the sake of being pricey (read: Pixel) and being pricey because you have the best spec available. lomsha Yep at least this looks and feels like an $850 phone. Gjorgi Lazarovski Why biased tho? They called out the Pixel for it's price too, wtf. Like, everyone did. David Ruddock I don't know, maybe read our review? "Price: There's no way around it, the price points are high. iPhone high. And you're going to be hard-pressed to convince the value-obsessed that there's nearly $800 of smartphone in a Pixel XL." http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/10/18/google-pixel-review-a-very-good-phone-by-google/ My name is…. Pixel is a dud, worst value for money ever. You should have been far more negative for Pixel than you were. Sweet talking it doesn't change things. Just because you mention that the price was high, doent meant that you shouldnt have angrily bashed it (if you were a subjective reviewer) And no, S8 doesn't ask a lot. Its a true flagship with the appropriate price. 1+3 owner here. 2kool4skool Shhh... Pixels have G logo on their back. That alone worth the $200. Seriously though, pixels are often get too many undeserved praises (just my opinion) in tech sites, probably because it's the "nerds and purists" devices, which make up most of tech sites target audience. It even got best phone of the year award if I'm not mistaken despite the fact it doesn't have a lot of features a $800 phones should have anf it's infested with bugs and problems even until this day. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All Google phones get undeserved praise, especially on Android sites. The reason for that should be self-evident. It's self-preservation. Defenestratus It's just a dang shame that you aren't on the editorial payroll at AP. Just a dang shame I tell ya. Max Big comment fail... Both are pricey and both were called for it. Middlefinger Still hung up on updates i see. Is Googles 7.1.whatever really any better than 7.0 with Samsungs mods? Whats the difference? Whats the advantage? In reality, there isnt any. Samsung doesnt run stock android, and isnt bound by Googles mods, or Googles fixes. It can do its own, and that may mean having a slightly lower number in the settings, but it has no negative effect on the security or experience. Other OEMs are the same LG never used 4.4.3 or 4.4.4 on the G2 or 3, but had al the fixes and updates they needed, because the Google updates were device specific and not necessary. Benjamin Walburn It might not make a difference for bugs and security flaws, but certain APIs need the OS update. The image keyboard and app icon shortcuts are two examples. More importantly, there's just no reason to not use 7.1. It's been 4 months since official launch, and major OEMs get early access. Middlefinger Maybe Samsung arent happy with the quality? 7.1 and its variant have been rather.. buggy, of late. Lollipop was like that, its was the worst, and i know Samsung had a lot of custom code in their version. There is no reason though why Samsung cant implement its own version of APIs, or simply wait to avoid issues. Rod Just stop. Middlefinger Stop what? Do you even read this site, the evidence is right here. Rod Samsung doesn't keep their phones updated because they're too busy making unwanted, duplicate apps. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, Google never makes unwanted duplicate apps. Rod Such as? tim242 You need to get a life, if all you have to do is bitch about duplicate apps. EVERY DAY. Rod My life is fine, thanks. Middlefinger No they make time to release to make sure the software works properly. They have to do that because Googles release often doesn't, just like all the problems seen on 7.1.2 lately. Unwanted apps you say?? Like most of the Google apps.. Rod You make it look better than it is. Samsung phones are the most buggy, according to the developers. Middlefinger Are they now, where is this 'developer' news i seem to have missed? Rod https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/3xgxg2/why_is_there_so_much_hate_against_samsung/ Middlefinger One temporary example that is not longer true. What about all of googles messy code and bugs, that kill phones? Benjamin Walburn Oh, they definitely could, but a duplicate API isn't the same as the original, especially in Android. App developers would have to add additional code for the Samsung API. Even mirroring the API entirely wouldn't work, as apps look at the system API level to decide how to run. Even if Samsung copied it perfectly, apps would still detect it as an older Android version and not use the features. I can't comment on the bugginess of the later release. I haven't had any problems with updates, but that would be a valid concern. Godspoken That hero image is freaking amazing. Is the picture on the screen photoshopped? I almost read AP reviews for the great photographs of phones as much as I do for the actual facts and opinions at this point. David Ruddock It's a real image. The screen is color corrected a bit (thanks to Jeff for that) to match the tone of the pavement. But I took the photo on the S8, zoomed in and lined it up, then took the picture with my RX10, yeah. Rod Of course it was edited, to remove the red tint. Lol Crafted Crows It is an impressive piece of hardware but after 1 day of use my fingers hurt :). I have the S7 and I find that size to be perfect. While the screen gorgeous, it's too tall for 1 hand use and the infamous hamburger menu is killing my fingers. Not comfortable at all. Margaritas Ante Porcos Great review. As always. Beautiful phone but we won't see the beauty because we'll have to hide this fragile cutie inside a case. Also Bixby is total crap. So sad to say this but as many other disappointed Galaxy fans I will skip on S8. Absolutely not worth buying. At least not for that money. Fr0gg0 Better luck next time, Samsung. Dallas King Fingerprint scanner on the power button, on the side would have been better. Eumelanin Knight Samsung sees to have an innovative then perfect cycle with their phone. I look forward to seeing what's up with the S9. Yup, I went there. That full screen fingerprint sensor, maybe? Rod There's a really noticeable red tint on that display tim242 Where is that in the review? Oh, it is not there. Rod There's an obvious red tint on the reviewed unit, unless you're daltonic. https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07210-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07227-1.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07218.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07222.jpg https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nexus2cee_DSC07220.jpg Plus, there's this: https://www.cnet.com/news/some-samsung-galaxy-s8-phones-ship-with-red-tinted-screens/ tim242 He did not mention it, so it could be lighting. The story you linked says only SOME UNITS AND CAN BE MANUALLY FIXED. Rod Well, let's ask @rdr0b11:disqus then BTW: never saw anyone take pictures in broad daylight whilst illuminating the subject with a red light. Maybe the sun shines differently where he lives. Roy You are right, the red tint is clearly noticeable from the pictures and it's bothering me a lot that no one (not even the reviewer) is talking about it. Rod As a LCD-phone owner, I'm deeply disturbed by screen tint. I like my whites milk-like. mlj11 I know Bixby's gonna be unpopular (around the enthusiast crowd at least) but I wish I had something like Bixby Vision. After Goggles' apparent abandonment by Google, I still haven't found a simple and good enough replacement for it. Using Assistant on my Pixel XL just plain doesn't work for stuff like item recognition or QR code reading. Rod Cannot unsee the lag. http://i.imgur.com/kHx9ayV.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Flipboard has always been very laggy. It doesn't surprise me that its replacement is also laggy. Personally, it doesn't matter to me. I never use Flipboard anymore, I don't use Google Now, and I would be very unlikely to use Bixby. ericshmerick The defense has begun lol Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ No defense. Bixby's info thing is laggy. If that matters to you, don't buy the phone. Rod You can deal with low framerate... But I doubt you can deal with the phone freezing up! http://i.imgur.com/qa22ZNQ.gif Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Fake. He's not even touching the phone, except when he touches a grayed out option that doesn't do anything. That makes me think your Bixby lag gif is fake, too. Rod If you watched the video, you'll see that he mentions the software has problems, exactly when that part is displayed. whispy_snippet "Fake". Classic. m477 Yeah, Michael Fisher is payed by Samsung competitors to make the S8 look laggy, obviously. Iamsecond Your comment was brilliantly sarcastic, but 'payed?' Seriously? I'm sorry for picking on you, but this is the third time I've seen this misspelling this week and I'm starting to wonder if I'm going slightly mad! Surely 'paid' is a common enough word that everyone should know how to spell it? m477 Welp, I must have been drunk or something. I usually write in mostly correct English, I swear. Miles Reiter To add on to what others have already said, that's not a grayed out option, there's no scenario in Instagram where the search button will be grayed out and non-functional. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ So he just didn't touch it. It's very obvious he's not touching anything on the phone in that GIF. You could also take a screen shot of that Instagram page, and fake it that way. I'll believe these problems when I see them widely reported, not because some bozo posts a gif. JC Just go watch the video. Railwayman Rule no 1 for the Humanity: Galaxy S model X is the BEST DEVICE IN THE WORLD (must be stated in caps so no one miss this basic FACT!) Every kind of criticism of a Galaxy S device are FAKE. Galaxy S is simply the BEST and everyone who are disagreeing are just ignorant and try to escape the reality. Galaxy S is also the FASTEST device in the world, no one comes even close - every video showing any kind of slow down below 120 fps and instant response are FAKE. It is the FASTEST device and this fact take precedence over everything else. Don't question the ALMIGHTY GALAXY! It can lead to the Samsung Underground, which is a world where everyone has a Galaxy with Knox 0x1 Warranty Void and are expected to use Health and Gear VR daily, otherwise they will be punished! Winston Thats a strange issue. I loaded the S8 home screen + Hello Bixby onto my S7. No lag. Rod It's called inconsistent performance. Which means it won't happen all the time. PoisonApple31 Which is why it is not a big deal Rod For someone shelling out 800 bucks for a phone, I think it's not ok. iPhones will be butter-smooth for the same price. Liam Bulkley Mostly. iPhones stutter as well. They do still have the best touch latency, though. Peter World Citizen Looks fake ... Rod What does? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It is fake. Brad Andrews Having used the S8+ for the last 24hrs and being the furthest thing from a Samsung fanboy as possible I.e the last galaxy I owned was the S3 and I truly thought my next phone would be the pixel 2 - All I can say is, Google have gotta step up massively with the pixel 2 if they want to compete. This phone is super smooth (even the stupid bixby app) and an absolute pleasure to use, I really never thought I'd say that about a Samsung phone. Say what you will about Samsung phones of the past, but have a week with 1 of these and I'd say all but the most hardcore pixel purests would be converted, or at least concede it's a great phone. Rod Everyone said the same about the Note 7, until... https://www.xda-developers.com/with-the-note-7-samsung-still-delivers-embarrassing-real-world-performance/ Brad Andrews Hey, I'm just calling it as I see it. If this thing slows down and starts lagging I'm more than happy to sell it and grab the pixel 2 when it comes out. As it stands right now, my opinion is that it's a great phone with no lag. I'm sure if we wanted to, we could find an instance of a pixel lagging in what is basically a 3rd party app (bixby) as well. So this one gif all you Samsung haters are frothing over isn't what I'd call conclusive evidence, it's certainly not what I've experienced. Kevin Davis Great review, thanks. Beautiful phones, but they're going to be a pass for me. Vivek Rameses You can install the new launcher by updating the TouchWiz apk on apkmirror. Had it for a few weeks and it runs fine. Rocket Bixby Vision can identify objects. I showed it a Galaxy S7. It gave me results for iPads. Sounds like Apple will be picking up this idea for Siri pretty soon Marty LMAO...Even machines know Sammy copies Cakefish Interestingly, from the reviews that I have been reading, the Exynos 8890 beats the Snapdragon 835 in single-core Geekbench performance and loses narrowly in multi-core performance. So, overall, very similar levels of performance. Shows that Samsung was ahead of the curve last year, meaning that the Galaxy S7 should age well CPU-wise. Marty I think I can easily pass on the S8. I prefer a device not have a pink tinted display. The last time this happened was with the HTC 10. Too much competition, Samsung, for you to put out lackluster products. jasonlowr Well, Firstly, you dont have the money. Secondly, everyone knows you're a samsung hater. Come on, whenever you comment on any samsung articles,its all about hates from you. Last but not least, youre not a very good actor/lier. Lol. Peace! Marty Lol...Keep your day job. You're funny, but the other kind of funny. 😁 4Ui812 David Ruddock 2 questions. Do you know if the bootloader is locked like on the S7E from T-MOBILE ? Why is this 8 hour old article pushed to the top of the list ? I think I know the answer to the second question. But do you have any info on the first ? Rod Because it's relevant? 4Ui812 Paid. Rod Yes, they get paid better when more people click on pages with ads. roverstim ewww, pink tint. D13H4RD2L1V3 I can definitely see the fingerprint sensor placement being an afterthought. Had Synaptics and Samsung got that display sensor working in time, the feature where you can wake the device from sleep by "pressing" the portion of the display that houses the home button would have a lot more worth. Oh well, hope it's ready in time for the Note 8, but with rumors that even Apple is having issues with it, we may have to wait for 2018. I don't find Bixby all that useful, and certainly not to the point where it needs its own button. It has its merits, but overall, I feel that it's one of those features where people use once or twice after unboxing and then forget that it existed, like Siri, or those who are deeply-vested in the Google ecosystem would probably just use Google Now. I find that rather sad, because some of its other add-ons, such as the ability to play other forms of audio through the device itself while it's casting another audio source via Bluetooth is one of those things that are immensely useful. I just wish that they're actually more prominently shown so that people know it exists. It's a nice phone overall, though. Makes me optimistic for the next Galaxy Note. tim242 THE CAMERA IS NOT THE SAME AS THE S7. 260 VS 333 Rod Who do those numbers represent? tim242 The S7 has the Sony 260. The S8 has the Sony 333. Michaels_28 I've heard that it is the same hardware, different firmware. (and different software) tim242 It is a new sensor.. This has been confirmed. The S7 has the IMX260, the S8 has the IMX333 dblock I am a huge fan of rooting and ROMing my phones, but the truth is, being a crack flasher and flashing new ROMs all the time is really time consuming. So while it will take a while to get used to not being able to do this, and losing Viper4Android (hoping I can make Samsung's EQ work somewhat close to V4A) and some other customizations/tweaks, overall I think I will be more satisfied not worrying about trying to flash the "best" ROM all the damn time. I do hold out hope that basic root is achieved on the phone so I can get V4A going on this thing, but I won't hold out too long. 2kool4skool If you're so worried about sound, galaxies have Adapt Sound feature that you might want to try out. I'm also a former user of viper4android, but decided to ditch it last year because adapt sound is easier to set up. It also sounds fantastic on my hd 449. dblock I can't remember if Adapt Sound works with Bluetooth headphones or not, do you know if it does? That's why I loved V4A, could really fine tune all different output types; phone speakers, headset, Bluetooth and dock. 2kool4skool Well, that's a bummer. No, as far as I know it doesn't work with Bluetooth headphones. ROB You need to add something... DO NOT BUY the unlocked version Chips N Care to explain? ROB Google the S7 unlocked fiasco...they are still on 6.0.1...all other S7 have been updated to 7.0 and they have abandoned the ones bought directly from Samsung... Cakefish Galaxy S7 Geekbench scores. The Exynos 8890 processor was ahead of its time, it'll remain very competitive throughout 2017. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ccc4e4d7770fbc4f43c68d526b56060883fe49a88537a5e39d175e8207d6c05e.png Rod If even the Snapdragon 800 holds well to this day.. blairh Fingerprint placement is complete garbage. Still no stereo speakers. S8 is too tall. More impressed with the S8 Plus. TeeJay1100 Size is personal preference. I'll say this, after playing with them in Best buy, the S8 feels just right. The S8+ is a tad taller. blairh The S8 is too tall IMO. tim242 The S8+ is even taller... blairh I just think the S8 is way too tall when compared to the iPhone 7. Apple will be releasing a 5.8" screen phone this fall with roughly the same footprint of the iPhone 7. That to me makes a lot more sense then going so tall as the S8 for the same size screen. tim242 You have no idea what dimensions the next iphones will be. blairh You're right. But I also believe the strong rumors of a 5.8" screen with a footprint the size of the current iPhone 7. tim242 There were those same strong rumors about the S8. The current iphone 7 would not fit a 16:9 5.8" display... blairh I believe this is what we will see this fall. http://www.iclarified.com/60037/diagram-allegedly-reveals-design-of-58inch-iphone-with-4mm-bezels-images tim242 Yeah, no. Apple has had gigantic bezels for 10 years. They aren't going to be suddenly nothing. blairh You're dead wrong. Gruber was saying in spring of 2016 that his sources have told him how they want an iPhone that is all screen. I expect minimal to no bezel on the next iPhone. Ming Chi Kuo is also backing up this story with his reports. tim242 There will most likely be smaller bezel, but most likely not what you are describing...especially if they are unable to get the fingerprint scanner under the display. Rod Isn't the S8 even taller? Lol blairh I'm assuming you mean the S8 Plus. Yes, it is, but it also has a larger screen. I just think the S8 is way too tall when compared to the iPhone 7. Apple will be releasing a 5.8" screen phone this fall with roughly the same footprint of the iPhone 7. That to me makes a lot more sense then going so tall as the S8 for the same size screen. Rod But the S8+ is proportionally taller than the S8 lol. blairh I understand that. But I can swallow that size phone when the screen is that large. I think the next iPhone will give you the same size screen in a smaller package. Michaels_28 iPhone 7's body cannot house a 5.8" screen even with zero bezel. blairh It absolutely can. Corner to corner diagonally it's 6". Semianonymous Kinda reminds me of the s6 in a lot of ways. Sacrifices made to acheive a new design. At least they didn't kill the waterproofing and SD slot this time around. lomsha I'm quite tempted. Paul Quinn We knew about the poor fingerprint sensor placement for quite some time. I thought that's probably something that could prove to be less of an issue over time (muscle memory). But now it's sounding like it doesn't even work well. That is enough to kill it for me. I am spoiled by instantaneous unlock on the Mate 9. I don't understand how a brand new phone from THE premier Android manufacturer isn't at least getting close to that. Rod Rushed changed. It was supposed to be underneath the screen. Zahir_SMASH I just want to know what round icon pack that is. Cakefish Pretty sure it's the same one as I use: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.themezilla.pixelui Rod Looks neat for a free app. Zahir_SMASH Thanks! Roy Am I the only one noticing the red-tinted screen issue with the photos of the reviewed device? tim242 Some units have that, mostly the units sent out early. It can be adjusted in settings. Roy Not necessarily. Xda reported that in some units the red-tinted display is not being fixed even after adjusting the rgb and samung is replaging those units. Also, why this reviewed unit was not adjusted before taking the pictures? Just look at them and tell me, the issue is pretty noticeable. Rod Don't worry, there are lots of people in denial here. Rod Oh boy... https://i.imgur.com/oYe2HPZ.jpg Rod Nope. ×XWreckTeamX× Which pics are you talking about I cant notice it that much. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It seems pretty obvious to me in all the photos of the phone where there's white on the display. The white looks pinkish. The screen shots look pure white, though. morrisp Are you in Studio City, David? Ahmad Alnusif Is this review applicable also to the Exynos version of S8+? I see mention of SnapDragon 835 specific features so will they be there in the international version? Fred Question is, where did you get that burger ? Anton Kuznetsov ADOPTABLE STORAGE Does it have it? Rod Seeing as they blocked it in the S7, I wouldn't hold my breath. Nathan J This is the first Android phone since last April when I chose the iPhone 6s over the LG G5 (which, given the bootloop reports, was probably a good choice) that has made me seriously consider switching back. One thought keeps repeating itself to me: the 2015 iPhone 6s will most likely get updates for one year after the 2017 Galaxy S8 stops getting them, given the companies' five and two year update ranges. I can see entry level phones only getting a year or two of updates, but a $750 or $850 phone? This is a hard truth that Android fanboys are going to have to accept, and really start demanding changes to. It's one thing that Apple absolutely does better, and I think it's something that would not be very hard to change. Let's demand five years of updates. Apple can do it and they're more profitable than anyone. Stop. Don't make excuses about why Apple's phones aren't that good or their updates aren't as significant. Don't excuse bad behavior. Have the courage to demand better. If all the phone manufacturers adopted all the best practices of their competitors, and shed their biggest problems, imagine how much more awesome phones would be. That said, we really don't know how long Samsung will update the S8. Maybe they give it three years. Who knows. They've done almost everything right here, and I commend them for that. I wouldn't have minded if they kept the physical home/fingerprint button, if they did it like on the iPhone 7. Not a real button but a part of the screen that vibrates in such a way that feels like a button. Go to a Best Buy and check it out. It's very cool. The fingerprint scanner as-is on the S8... I have seen no one praise this. I'm sure Samsung knows, and it was just too late for them to change it. If everything is the same next year (but updated of course), but the fingerprint reader is mid-center of the back, the S9 will be damn near perfect. As for Bixby — in my opinion, the less said about it, Siri, and Google Assistant, the better. I'll just Google it. Or Bing it if I know I'll be running into ad-infested sites (like Wikia) as the Google app tunnels around my ad blocker (iOS). Either way, I'll take a search app over an assistant app any day of the week. I've tried Siri, Google, and Cortana and have found all of them lacking. So no thanks to Bixby. Disappointing about buttongate, but not a dealbreaker, either. Rod In most cases, the updates are ceased due to the SoC vendor (read: Qualcomm) not providing new blobs after 24 months. That's why there's a rumor Google is designing its own chip, like Apple and Samsung do, so they don't get blocked by Qualcomm. Nathan J I had a Motorola Photon. We heard all the excuses. At the end of the day, it's still a flagship that got zero updates, so it doesn't really matter whose fault it is or why. I mean, it's interesting on a trivial level to find out why, but you're no less screwed at the end of the day. That said, if Google could get control over the hardware in their phones, they'd be better off. Maybe. Can they make more money selling phones that are supported for five years? That's a cycle and a half they're pissing away. Apple can take that. Rod I really hope Google pulls an Apple someday. 5 years of support sounds great to me. Talos the Robot You are reviewing a defected phone with a red tint display and you are awarding it with editor's choice "Most Wanted" accolade, hahaha LOL.... francoism Still sure it'll suffer from the much staggered OTA updates. roverstim Seriously, no mention of the pink screen in the review ? Other OEM's would be picked up on this Rod This bothered me too, seeing as how evident it is. tim242 http://m.androidcentral.com/samsung-clears-air-red-tinted-galaxy-s8-displays Rod I'd like to see a pic of this review unit after calibrating.

Ash First official android with kernel version 4.4? dirtyjudo Cash me when it's time for security update. How bout dat? Daniel Tiberius System level EQ sounds neato. I'll have to play with that. Also I read that the Bluetooth to two separate devices feature comes with Bluetooth 5, or the processor and not from Samsung. Anyone know? Peter World Citizen It's best to read some reviews from Apple's love child: The Verge ... When the oppositions praise their main competitor's device then it must be really good. 1. http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15328968/samsung-galaxy-s8-review-s8-plus 2. http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/19/15354444/samsung-galaxy-s8-big-screen-ergonomics 3. http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15338052/samsung-galaxy-s8-touchwiz-android-software Anunnaki "At $750 and $850 for the S8 and S8+, respectively, there's no denying Samsung is asking a lot for the privilege of joining the Galaxy S club this year." It's at-least priced better than the Pixel. Jay I was interested in finishing the review until I saw that you tested it in 1080p mode only. I understand that the phone came with the setup initially, but that setting is what many people will want to use. Rod What's the difference, tbh? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I bet if I walked up to 100 S8 users and asked them if they changed the screen resolution to WQHD, 99 of them would look at me like I had broccoli growing out of my ears. Roberto Should have mentioned a killer feature that for once has been flawlessly implemented by big S development team, Dex. Rod Like all other reviewers, they'll probably do a DeX review when they get one. Lord Ravenor Good review. I'm not certain I agree with David on the size and placement of the fingerprint scanner, though: 1. I went to the shop yesterday and they had a display unit of the S8+ -- it is actually about as tall as an iPhone 7 Plus but a bit narrower (I held them side-by-side). The S8 seems to be about the same size as an iPhone 7, which I find too dainty. Now, I don't have big hands but I'm so used to my iPhone 7 Plus (I've had the bigger iPhone since the 6 Plus) that it's jarring for me to use something that's smaller like the S8 is. As an aside -- based on all the leaks, it looks like the S8 gives us a preview of what the iPhone 8 will be like in-hand. 2. The placement of the home button seems to be just fine. You can definitely train your hand, without too much effort, to place it where it needs to go so you unlock it as you pull it out of your pocket -- I don't expect it to be too much of an adjustment. I'd say that it's about the same as what I experienced with my Nexus 6P in the beginning, even though the 6P's button is recessed. That said, I can't speak for accuracy since it was a display unit and I obviously couldn't save try the scanner with it. The S8+ didn't have any perceptible lag but again, the unit I played with was a display unit that had what was probably a demo ROM SKU (I don't know why I forgot to check that). The unit felt good in hand, overall -- but weirdly, I liked the footprint of the Note 7 more because the S8+ feels like it's too narrow for its height. Then again, I'm used to the dimensions of the iPhone 7 Plus. If there isn't one already, I'm sure there'll be a 'stock' Nougat them in the Galaxy store. There were ones for the Note 5 so I don't see why there wouldn't be for the S8+ Stefan van Manen Its a great phone. Got it for almost a week now and I really like it so far. My major issue with this phone is the lack of stereo front facing speakers. Im coming from a Nexus 6p and I really miss that front facing speaker sound when playing games or watching youtube videos. Other minor things like the fingerprint location, useless bixby button and purple glare at the edge part of the screen don't bother me that much. Oh and first things I did was to replace the sammy launcher (the swipe up animation is soo laggy it hurts my eyes), switch up the navigation keys and install a pixel icon theme which made the switch from my Nexus 6p a lot easier. Railwayman I think it is fascinating with this Samsung fixation around the world. EVERY device from them with the magic Galaxy S name is... A WINNER! Same story every year.;) Every time this brand "wins" my dislike of them just grows bigger due to such things as carrier distribution/lock-in/branding, Knox 0x1 Warranty Void, Grace UX/TW, heavy modifications, developer unfriendliness, duplicated services (every Google service MUST have a duplicated Samsung ditto), mainstream design and so on. Even more annoying is the theory about the need for other devices to 'replicate Samsung' - i.e. that just because that brand do something with their design, EVERYONE is 'supposed' to follow to such an extent that it is perfectly 'logical' to bash products using arguments such as 'bigger bezels than the Galaxy S x' etc. Another issue I have with Samsung is their region SIM lock. i.e. that a 'local' SIM card must be used before the product is 'unlocked'. Samsung make technically good hardware but it is seriously crippled by their policies and vendor lock-in. I think it is fascinating that every test give them a passing grade despite those actions - even worse is when 'counter-articles' are written just because a Sammie is questioned like last year with the XDA Note 7 performance tests. "Samsung Central' felt it an obligation to immediately post an article about how useless benchmarks are.... What a 'coincidence'. I am very much unable to see how the Galaxy S8 can be the 'best device' in the market from a holistic perspective. There are way too many problematic policies, carrier BS and nonsense such as 'Knox is tripped, forget your Health and Gear VR' and so on involved and yes, those things just can't be compensated by the hardware. A very fast brick is... still a brick. A seriously locked in device with carrier BS (not to mention the value proposition it means) just can't be the 'best device in the world'. Galaxy S8 is first rate internals and display with third rate policies where the major ideology is 'My Way or the Highway! (The Samsung Way or Knox 0x1 Warranty Void and your fancy Gear VR in the trash!' Sorry to be critical but I am a bit tired of how a device can be praised year after year after year without any kind of holistic viewpoint where policies are important considerations. Teppka Have my Galaxy S8 plus on pre-order and ordered Thin Fit from Spigen a week ago as they ship internationally. Idea was to receive Spigen case by the time S8 plus arrives. They had two shipping options, DHL with 2 days delivery indication and USPS with no delivery estimation. So I paid $13 for shipping by USPS. After one week tracking stuck and keeps showing the package is in LA, Canada (Canada?!) . So I contacted Spigen for update and reply was that shipping will take 4-7 weeks. You've got it right, 4-7 WEEKS, which is about 2 MONTHS?! And they never even cared to specify this delivery estimation in the website. So the solution they offered me is to wait for a MONTH and if by the end of May its not delivered I should contact them and they will see what they can do. $13 for international shipping with 4-7 weeks delivery? Aliexpress sales cases for $3 including delivery and those delivered within a month internationally and you are informed about estimated delivery time BEFORE you choose shipping method. Spigen charges $13 for delivery and after you pay and item is sent you become to know that delivery is 4-7 WEEKS. I asked Spigen what am I supposed to wrap my Galaxy S8 plus into untill the case may or may arrive in 2 months but they do not really care and keep saying wait till the end of May. I was buying Spigen cases for over 5 years for my phones and am now amazed by their perfect customer service. Any suggestions what I should do? blairh Reviewers are not being harsh enough about the absolute garbage fingerprint location. That is a deal breaker for many. Then the S9 will fix this and reviewers will rejoice. tim242 You are dumb as dirt. Every single review trashes the fingerprint scanner placement. Rod He either edited the comment, or you're the dumb one here. tim242 Nope, it still says that reviewers haven't been harsh enough. That is a lie. Rod Maybe in his eyes they weren't as harsh as he expected? blairh Being critical has levels. Reviewers are not being harsh enough regarding this you prick. tim242 Yes they are. Now, you are a blocked prick. Michaels_28 I enjoyed Mr. Ruddocks' excellent review as always. He is one of the few whose opinion I can trust on the Internet. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I am genuinely surprised that the S8 battery has lasted this long. Coming up on 8 hours SoT with screen brightness between ¼ & ½.

Technology for robotic cars already here, but next steps could be harder than we think about 3 hours ago Neil Briscoe Video Images Motoring editor Michael McAleer explains the benefits and risks associated with the driverless car and how they work. Look! No hands: Self-driving vehicles are on the way, sooner rather than later With no need to keep eyes on the road and hands on the wheel, commuting time can be used for other activities Previous Image Next Image         It is rather like that moment in Generic Science Fiction Movie 2: The Return. The rag-tag group of surviving humans are cloistered in the corner of some vast building, taking stock of who is left, what supplies they have and what to do next. Then they hear a metallic tinkling and everyone tenses: the robots are coming. Thus it is with the car world right now. We know that fully automated vehicles are a technical possibility and that prototypes have been proven to work. We know, or at least suspect, that they are appealing, not least to people who don’t drive, who don’t care about cars or, for a variety of reasons, are physically unable to drive. We also know that there is a safety imperative. Humans can be terrific at detecting danger and making decisions quickly, but machines can be faster still. Once those machines can be taught the nuances of decision making and traffic management they will be always on, always in peak condition, without the fallibility of a distracted, imperfect human brain. So where do we stand? There are five levels of autonomous driving. Level 0 is what we’ve been used to for the past century or so: a human in total control of the car. Level 1 has arguably been in place since the 1950s and the development of the first cruise-control systems. Level 2 is, in the broadest sense, about where we are now. Functions such as radar-guided cruise control and steering that nudges and vibrates the wheel, to keep you in your lane on the motorway, are the kicking-off point, but level 2 also includes more complicated systems, such as Volvo’s Pilot Assist and Mercedes-Benz’s Drive Pilot, which can take, for short bursts, total control of the car at speeds of up to 130km/h. Change lanes At the Shanghai motor show this year Mercedes showed a development of the system, fitted to the new S-Class, that can change lanes for you, and take total control for up to 30 seconds. The Volkswagen group has introduced a safety system, available on models as affordable as a Golf or even a Skoda Octavia, that can safely bring the car to a halt if it detects that the driver isn’t tweaking the steering, or touching the pedals, and is therefore likely to have fallen asleep or in some other way become incapacitated. Other remote systems, such as those that can twist your car into a parking space, or call the emergency services if they detect that the car has crashed, are now common. Ditto autonomous emergency-braking systems, which are fast becoming the 2010s answer to anti-lock brakes and electronic stability control. These, along with radar-guided cruise control, are the initial building blocks of robotic driving, but they are still some distance from the next step – Level 3. In Level 3, the driver can switch off entirely and let the car take control of multiple functions, but will still have to be on board and be ready to take back control in an emergency. Many have said that Level 3 should really be skipped entirely and that it is unfair to ask drivers to take on the responsibility of monitoring complex systems such as these. Level 4, they argue, is the true next step. Level 4 is almost fully automated – you get in, push a button and the car takes you to where you’re going, within a broadly, but still strictly, defined set of parameters. Cripplingly expensive We could, in theory, create a Level 4 car today. The tech exists, and it is a matter of just fitting it to a car, surely? Well, not quite. The tech does indeed exist, but the laser-radar scanners (LIDAR) which are needed for a car to be able to find its way through the world are cripplingly expensive – at least €10,000 each wholesale, and a car needs at least three of them. Beyond that, the processing power needed for the car’s computers to be able to make sense of all the inputs from lasers, radar, cameras and more is huge, and it has to be physically there in the car. “Most of the intelligence for how the car reacts, how it functions, how it avoids obstacles, that has to be in the car, physically. You’re not going want to go up to a cloud to ask ‘should I avoid this truck?’ ” Wendy Belluomini, director of IBM’s Dublin Research Laboratory told The Irish Times. “Other things, like routes and where should I go and so on, that can be part of the connected car. But the safety-critical autonomous drive capability, that has to be built into the car, because if wifi or cellular towers go down, you’re suddenly going to have all these cars that can’t function.” Tesla’s yet-to-be-seen electric car already has buyers lining up Paris Motor Show: Electricity in the air, but brands are thinner on the ground Continental prepares for demise of combustion engine It’s the expense that adds uncertainty as to when truly self-driving robotic cars will arrive. While the likes of Google and Apple have billions to burn when it comes to developing the complex systems needed for autonomous driving, the car makers do not. Every dollar and euro has to be accounted for and has to lead, eventually, to a profit. Future-gazer and technology expert Don Norman told The Irish Times that “for autonomous cars, it’s going to be a long time”. ‘Faster than is safe’ “The car makers are pushing it faster than is safe. They’re all capable of doing the same thing and the difference is the corporate structure that decides whether it’s safe to release it or not. Mercedes is the leader in what it has allowed its cars to do, such as some automated highway driving. “But look at Tesla, which announced that it could do so much, that the car could automatically pass other cars and so on. Well, I’ve been working with companies, and they’re all working on the same technology, their cars can all do the same things, but they’re not ready to release it yet. “Tesla released it and said it was great, and now they’re apologising and drawing it back, and we all predicted that – the cars are just not ready yet. Teslas are remarkably good cars, but on top of that the easiest driving is highway driving, but city driving is much harder, and no-one is ready for that yet. “And the Google car is not a good comparison, because they use extremely accurate mapping and much more expensive equipment than would ever be possible on a commercial car, and even Google says that they’re going to kill somebody some day, and that’s just because it’s just inevitable. So I’m still talking decades before autonomous cars are a major issue.” It could well be decades before customers are ready for both the philosophical switch and the expense, especially in Ireland. The comparison with anti-lock brakes and electronic stability control is apt, as when those life-saving devices were still on the options list, Irish buyers voted with their wallets and bought shinier alloy wheels and sunroofs instead. ‘Lagging behind’ Paolo Alves, managing director of BMW Ireland, told The Irish Times that “there is no reason for us to be lagging behind in terms of technological developments in passenger cars, and I think it’s interesting that Ireland embraces technology – you just have to look at the number of high-tech companies investing here and putting up headquarters here – but still has a very conservative side. “The problem is that a lot of people don’t know the tech is coming yet. We in the industry talk about it all the time, but for many customers, they are still amazed by things such as active cruise control. Perhaps we will be slightly behind continental Europe in adopting autonomous technology, but we already have farmers using totally autonomous agricultural equipment, and the first big step will probably be the automation of freight services.” As for the suggestion that it might be odd for a car maker that has built its reputation on driver enjoyment to be talking so positively about self-driving cars, Alves insists that the two can go hand-in-hand. “It’s not a must that the two should be mutually exclusive. We all love driving, but none of us loves traffic. “We are seen as an innovative brand and we must be at the leading edge. I think a BMW will always have the possibility for the driver to take over, but look at our Rolls-Royce concept – which was built to celebrate 100 years of the group – that had no driver controls at all, so we will build, under some brands, entirely driver-free cars.” When asked if Irish buyers would be willing to pay a, doubtless hefty, premium for the first wave of self-driving tech, Ciaran McMahon, managing director and chairman of Ford Ireland said, “I think we have some way to go before we get to the situation of customers paying for an autonomous car. In the initial instance, Ford sees autonomous driving technology coming into play in mainly ride-sharing or package delivery contexts. And then it is anticipated that the next wave of development will see the wider availability of AVs for purchase by consumers. By all means, we would see the mass of buyers take a wait and see approach, so the onus will be on us, the manufacturers, to convince them.” Official regulations One of the biggest issues for vehicle automation is not the ability to carve through traffic, nor negotiate tricky junctions, but to be able to weave through the red tape of official regulations. Wendy Belluomini said that she expects it will be at least 2021, or even 2025, before a self-driving system is sufficiently reliable to convince European regulators to approve it for sale. A bigger problem could be a lack of knowledge and engagement at an official level. When asked, none of the car companies we spoke to for this feature had had any contact with the Irish Government, at any level, on the subject of automation and regulation. The robots are ready. The robots are coming. It’s we humans, huddling in the corner, who may not be quite ready yet. WHO’S MAKING THE ROBOT CARS? BMW Group: The latest 5 Series has increasing levels of autonomy, as does the 7 Series, but full autonomy will probably come to Rolls-Royce first. BMW was among the first to develop self driving cars which could lap test tracks better than a human driver. Daimler-Benz: One of the leaders in current levels of vehicle autonomy. The Mercedes-Benz E-Class can already drive itself for short bursts on the motorway, and the S-Class has just been updated with a sophisticated Drive Pilot which can even change lanes for you. The company was forced into an embarrassing climb down when its adverts professed more robotic driving tech than existed. Fiat-Chrysler Automobiles: Fiat, Alfa Romeo and Jeep have been behind the curve in bringing self-driving tech to the roads, but behind the scenes FCA might actually have a lead on some of its rivals. Google’s Waymo self-driving subsidiary has announced an exclusive tie-up with Chrysler to develop robotic versions of the new Pacifica MPV. Ford: Ford has built an entire fake town in the US to help develop self-driving tech, and is pushing ahead in developing its own LIDAR sensors. The company is keen to skip driver-monitored Level 3 autonomy and go straight to hands-off, eyes-off Level 4. Honda: Honda has been focusing more on development of hydrogen fuel cells than on self-driving tech, but given its expertise in robotics (its anthropomorphic ASIMO robot in particular), expect Honda to catch up pretty soon. Jaguar Land Rover: Jaguar was one of the pioneers of self-driving, being part of the original European Project Prometheus, which developed some of the earliest robotic car systems in the late eighties. Since then, it has dropped back a little, concentrating on developing new models rather than robotic systems. It does have the clever All Terrain Progress Control system though, which can get cars moving from standstill on slippery surfaces. PSA Peugeot Citroen: Both Peugeot and Citroen have committed to using ‘non-expert’ drivers to test their autonomous tech, and Peugeot has shown off its Instinct autonomous concept car at Geneva this year, complete with reclining, airline-style seats. Renault-Nissan: While Renault has been more focused on creating electric cars, Nissan has been making great strides with automation, at least in prototype form. Nissan uses self-driving Leaf electric cars as in-factory shuttles in Japan, and the company has announced a collaboration with NASA to develop automated vehicle systems. Tesla: Tesla holds the dubious honour of being the first car maker to record the death of a customer who was using its self-driving systems, but the California start-up is one of the leaders in robot car tech. Current models are already hard-wired for Level 5 autonomy, and are simply waiting for software and legislation to catch up. Toyota-Lexus: Toyota, as is its tradition, hasn’t put much in the way of automated systems on sale yet, preferring to work away in the background perfecting their reliability. Lexus has prototype cars which can deal with motorways and main roads without any driver input, while the Prius and RX450h have long been the favoured development cars of Google as it works on its self-driving tech. Volkswagen Group: VW Group is arguably one of the most advanced car makers when it comes to autonomy, having been part of the original Stanford university team that won the DARPA robot car challenge. Audi’s ‘Jack’, a self driving A7, can already lap racetracks at ferocious speed, and Audi has set up a robot car subsidiary called Autonomous Intelligent Driving. VW’s MEB electric car architecture is fully robot-capable and all its MEB concepts thus far have featured fold-away steering wheels, while the recent SEDRIC concept was a self-driving capsule with a sofa and a 40-inch touchscreen on the inside. The upcoming new Audi A8 is expected to push the autonomous driving envelope, while simpler systems are already available on affordable models from VW, Skoda and Seat. Volvo: Volvo’s commitment to having no deaths involving one of its vehicles by 2020 has been a significant driver of its autonomous driving tech. It was one of the first to develop autonomous emergency braking, and the S90, V90 and XC90 models can already drive themselves for brief bursts on the motorway. This year’s new XC60 will have robotic steering which can swerve around any obstacles it encounters in an emergency situation.       Topics: Motors Ciaran Mcmahon Don Norman Paolo Alves Prometheus Project Wendy Belluomini Irish Government Nasa Alfa Romeo Apple Audi BMW Chrysler Citroen Daimler Darpa Dublin Research Laboratory Fiat Fiat Chrysler Automobiles Google Honda IBM Jaguar Jeep Land Rover Mercedes-Benz Nissan PSA-Peugeot-Citroen Peugeot Pilot Assist Renault Renault-Nissan Rolls-Royce Group SKODA Seat Toyota VW Volkswagen AG Volvo Group Vw Waymo Europe Genève Ireland Japan Mercedes(UY) Pacifica Shanghai United States Read More Tesla test drive: acceleration feels like being shoved down a lift shaft Opel’s new Grandland X will take on the Qashqai Volkswagen’s ID Crozz is its future electric crossover Toyota’s FT-4X concept harks back to the classic Land Cruiser Electric vehicles bring buzz to China’s biggest motor show Skoda’s Kodiaq sets the bar for affordable SUVs  Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Motors 2:06 Tesla test drive: acceleration feels like being shoved down a lift shaft Motors Continental prepares for demise of combustion engine Motors Skoda’s Kodiaq sets the bar for affordable SUVs Motors Seat starts its latest offensive with a sporty new Ibiza Sponsored ‘I’m still taking it 20 years on and loving it’ The Story of Home: 'People need a sense of belonging' Charting a family adventure on the Shannon-Erne Waterways ‘I just love it, it’s a lovely place to work,’ says ‘Burlo’ concierge Commenting on The Irish Times has changed.

We believe when everyone has access to personal flight, a new, limitless world of opportunity will open up to them,” said a statement on the website of the Kitty Hawk company, based in Google’s home town of Mountain View, California. “Today we’re announcing our first prototype of The Flyer, a personal flying machine that will become available for sale by the end of 2017.” The video showed the single-seat aircraft — with two pontoons and a spider web-like platform — taking off from a lake at an undisclosed location and hovering above the water, where it is meant to be used. The craft, propelled by eight rotors, takes off and lands vertically, like a helicopter. It is said to weigh about 220 pounds (100 kilograms) and fly at speeds up to 25 miles per hour (40 kph). and can hover at 15 feet (4.5 meters) high. The company describes the Flyer as “a new, all-electric aircraft,” which is “safe, tested and legal to operate in the United States in uncongested areas” under US federal regulations for ultralight aircraft. No pilot’s license is required, and two hours’ training is said to be all that is needed. The website offered few details about the company, but several reports in recent months have said Page has poured millions of dollars into Kitty Hawk and another electric car startup. Kitty Hawk president Sebastian Thrun, a Stanford University computer science professor who has been called the father of Google’s self-driving car, tweeted: “Changing the future of personal transportation. Join us @kittyhawkcorp to get information about #theFlyer prototype.” The company announced it was offering three-year “memberships” for $100 to be placed on a waiting list and to get a discount on the price of the new transporter. The price is to be announced later this year. Limited details The startup offered only limited details about the company. An email response to an AFP query said the lead engineers were Cameron Robertson and Todd Reichert, who created a startup called Aerovelo which aims to produce the fastest human-powered vehicle. Kitty Hawk said the flyer going on sale later this year will have a different design than the prototype. A blog post by writer Cimeron Morrissey, who took the flyer for a test run, offered some clues on how it feels. “The prototype looks and feels a lot like a flying motorcycle. You mount the seat and lean forward, just like you would on a bike,” she wrote. “I feel light and ecstatic and utterly free. This is just like my flying dreams!” Several other companies, including European conglomerate Airbus, have been working on similar flying machines.

The changes have been in the works for four months, but Google hadn’t publicly discussed most of them until now. The announcement in a blog post Tuesday reflects Google’s confidence in a new screening system designed to reduce the chances that its influential search engine will highlight untrue stories about people and events, a phenomenon commonly referred to as “fake news.” “It’s not a problem that is going to go all the way to zero, but we now think we can stay a step ahead of things,” said Ben Gomes, Google’s vice president of engineering for search. Besides taking steps to block fake news from appearing in its search results, Google also has reprogrammed a popular feature that automatically tries to predict what a person is looking for as a search request is being typed. The tool, called “autocomplete,” has been overhauled to omit derogatory suggestions, such as “are women evil,” or recommendations that promote violence. Google also is adding a feedback option that will enable users to complain about objectionable autocomplete suggestions so a human can review the wording. Facebook, where fake news stories and other hoaxes have widely circulated on its social network, also has been trying to stem the tide of misleading information by working with the Associated Press and other news organizations to review suspect stories and set the record straight when warranted. Facebook also has provided its nearly 2 billion users ways to identify posts believed to contain false information, something that Google is now allowing users of its search engine to do for some of the news snippets featured in its results. Google began attacking fake news in late December after several embarrassing examples of misleading information appeared near the top of its search engine. Among other things, Google’s search engine pointed to a website that incorrectly reported then President-elect Donald Trump had won the popular vote in the U.S. election, that President Barack Obama was planning a coup, and that the Holocaust never occurred during World War II. Only about 0.25 percent of Google’s search results were being polluted with falsehoods, Mr. Gomes said. But that was enough to threaten the integrity of a search engine that processes billions of search requests per day largely because it is widely regarded as the Internet’s most authoritative source of information.

As NASA's Cassini Spacecraft enters its final dive, called 'The Grand Finale', into orbiting Saturn's moon, Titan, Google commemorates the occasion by making a special Doodle. It shows an animated Cassini eagerly snapping pictures of Saturn as it passes through the gigantic planet's rings. Google Doodle celebrates the journey of the nearly 20-year-old spacecraft that has stayed in the space for 13 long years and is now beginning the last leg of its exploration journey. It reached Saturn's orbit in July 2004 and has been studying the planet and its moons ever since. Diving between Saturn's rings will start on April 26 and the little spaceship will be taking pictures of whatever it can as it passes through the giant sheets of icy debris, reports The Mirror. The April 26 dive is the first of 22 planned manoeuvres before it begins the very last part of its mission. "No spacecraft has ever gone through the unique region that we'll attempt to boldly cross 22 times,' said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington. "What we learn from Cassini's daring final orbits will further our understanding of how giant planets, and planetary systems everywhere, form and evolve. "This is a true discovery in action to the very end." Cassini's mission will officially terminate on September 15, after a planned plummet through Saturn's atmosphere.

I cover seven themes that, while not comprehensive, span critical elements of the great global drama. Here is a short summary of each this month. Climate action: Trump endeavours to dig a little coal  President Trump moved to dismantle President Obama’s climate legacy with an executive order that seeks to dismantle the Clean Power Plan. Within a week, 17 US states filed a legal challenge. China immediately pledged to uphold its Paris climate commitments, including considerable efforts not to use coal, accusing the US of “selfish” behaviour. The EU joined the pushback. Miguel Árias Cañete, the EU’s climate action commissioner, said: “The continued leadership of the EU, China and many other major economies is now more important than ever. When it comes to climate and the global clean energy transition, there cannot be vacuums, there can only be drivers, and we are committed to driving this agenda forward.” Fine sentiments. But whereas China can point to policies consistent with its rhetoric, unfortunately the same cannot be said of much EU national policymaking, as things stand. Among EU states, only Sweden, Germany and France are pursuing goals consistent with the Paris target of 40% cuts in carbon emissions by 2030, according to a study by Carbon Market Watch. As ever, much will depend on industry, and one encouraging development this month was a pledge by Eurelectric, a trade body which represents 3,500 utilities with a combined value of over €200 billion, vowing no new investments in coal plants after 2020. Among the 28 EU countries, only Polish and Greek companies did not join the initiative. Energy transition: Fast, but not fast enough Record new renewable power capacity was added in 2016, UNEP figures showed: 138 gigawatts of it, up 9% despite investment falling by a worrying 23%. Renewables now provide 11.3% of global electricity. New global solar capacity outpaced wind, IRENA reported, by 71 to 51 gigawatts. Solar in California exceeded 50% of supply, for the first time ever, causing a net market oversupply resulting in a short interval of negative wholesale prices. Costs of renewables keep falling. GTM Research predicts that solar will drop below two cents per kilowatt hour in 2017. Offshore wind is the latest renewable to defy predictions. EnBW and Dong won offshore wind tenders in the North Sea with the first subsidy-free bids. Moody’s reported that wind is now cheaper to install new than coal is to operate in 58 power plants across 15 Midwestern states, at $20 a megawatt versus $30. Trump told a rally in Kentucky that “the miners are coming back”. But they aren’t. Not even top US coal boss Robert Murray expects that, in the face of real contemporary economics. As for US renewables companies, they were professing this month that their industries will thrive even without the Clean Power Plan. Their confidence is rooted in record solar installation and above average wind installation in 2016, plus federally agreed tax credits that would be difficult for the Trump administration to dismantle. The news was also broadly good for EVs this month, with Tesla meeting production targets and its shares soaring to an all time high, for a while making it the most valuable car company in America. Meanwhile Big Oil, facing predictions of significant demand destruction by EVs within just years, is struggling to break even. Most of the oil majors didn’t even cover their costs in 2016, a Wall Street Journal analysis showed, despite a rising oil price. Some oil companies say American shale will help save them. But of the three main oil-producing shale belts, production has already peaked in two. The oil industry loves to taunt its critics with the mantra that “peak oil is dead”. For some players, it is clearly not the case. Mexico’s proved oil reserves have declined by more than a third since 2013. This month its National Hydrocarbons Commission country warned that the country will run out of oil in less than nine years if there are no new discoveries. What an incentive fast oil depletion like that must be to build a clean-energy economy fast, never mind climate change. (More on this in my keynote to the MIREC renewables congress in Mexico City on 10th May). And there are many other stand-out non-climate incentives around our troubled world, from air pollution to risk of stranded assets. But new figures showed that clean energy investment dropped 17% in the first quarter of 2017. Tech for Good: Evidence of effort Advances in artificial intelligence and robotics outpace even those in clean energy, and continue to be used in many ways for the betterment of society. But evidence that they have profound downsides was everywhere this month. YouTube and Google’s use of algorithms to automatically match ads with content is the basis for widespread criticism that they fed the spread of fake news in the crucial months running up to both the Brexit vote and Trump’s election, much of it orchestrated by a well organised nationalist-right dark-propaganda network. The two companies ran into further, related, trouble, with big name advertisers boycotting them for posting ads next to racist and other offensive content. The boycotters included such diverse actors as AT&T, the BBC, the British government, PepsiCo, Starbucks, Verizon, and WalMart. Google responded quickly, saying it was in a race to ramp up its AI capability to deal with the problem. But that is no easy task. Nobody has pulled off such a feat of megadata sifting before. As part of their effort, they have begun to use outside firms to verify ad standards. They might want to hurry. The inventor of the web, Tim Berners-Lee, argues that concentration of power over information, such as Goggle and Facebook now possess, is dangerous for society. He is plotting, with others in the Decentralized Information Group at MIT’s Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence (CSAIL), means to decentralise control of data in his creation. The threat AI and robotics pose to jobs becomes ever clearer. More than 10 million UK workers are at risk of being replaced within 15 years, PwC calculated, some 30% of the workforce. The IPPR estimates a similar figure: robots replacing 1 in 3 UK jobs over the next 20 years. A report by the US National Bureau of Economic Research goes further, suggesting that large numbers of jobs have already been lost to robotics in America, and are unlikely to come back. Wages have been depressed in the process, they contend. The question arises, then, as to how much this has been fuelling populist rage, on both sides of the Atlantic, making it easier for nationalist demagogues to push their argument that “the other” – immigrants and anyone else who is not in what psychologists call their in-group – is entirely to blame. Whatever the answer to that question about the past, the additional stress just around the corner will clearly pose a dire threat to social cohesion if nothing is done. The imperative for government and business to act is obvious. Truth: Liars under growing scrutiny As investigations into the conduct of the Trump election and the Brexit vote continue, it becomes ever clearer that the nationalist right is capable of extraordinary feats of voter manipulation. A group of UK academics warned this month that dark money is a threat to the integrity of British elections. The Electoral Commission is investigating whether work by Cambridge Analytica, one data firm at the heart of the controversy, constitutes an undeclared donation from an impermissible foreign donor. Cambridge Analytica is majority owned by the hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, a major bankroller of Donald Trump. Steve Bannon, Trump’s head of strategy, has been a major player in the development of the company and its capabilities. Filings of White House staffers’ interests this month show he has made millions shaping right-wing thought, via Cambridge Analytica and other organs. The pushback unfolding against this fast-emerging Orwellian narrative is often extraordinary to behold. The Los Angeles Times published a series of  essays by its editorial board this month. “Our Dishonest President”, the first was entitled. “Why Trump lies”, the second. They read like a science fiction novel of a dystopian future society. But they are about real-life America, today. New arenas of corporate responsibility are being stimulated, unsurprisingly. Google announced it will begin to display fact-checking labels to show if news it purveys is true or false. Facebook gave a green light to its employees to protest against Trump on May 1st. Dramas build slowly in the courts as truth and lies compete. A judge rejected Trump’s defense against a claim he incited violence at one of his rallies. Equality: Talk of cutting aid as famine rages Meanwhile, though you would hardly know it from mainstream media coverage, we are in the midst of the gravest humanitarian crisis since 1945 – since the creation of the United Nations. 20 million people face starvation and famine in Yemen, Somalia, South Sudan and Nigeria, the UN warns. Drought has descended on Kenya, triggering violence as displaced peoples migrate. Amid all this, populist nationalists continue to contend that aid budgets should be cut. The UK government, to its credit, is resisting this so far. As for the considerable potential role of clean energy in building equality and alleviating poverty, an international gathering of the Sustainable Energy for All organisation in New York this month called for more urgent action on progress towards global energy goals. In SolarAid, my colleagues and I could not agree more. Our work is based on the fact that if you burn oil in a kerosene lamp in Africa and it will cost you almost $80 a year, yet a solar lamp retailing at around $5 will give clean light for free, for 4 years. So if you were one of the poorest people in Africa, which would you rather do? Save $70 a year to spend on food and other essentials, in a time of famine, or burn a fistful of ten dollar bills each year, and risk your health breathing the fumes? This should be an obvious starting point for a massive programme to free up local money for the necessities of poverty alleviation, SolarAid contends. But sales of the most affordable of these lights are actually falling in Africa, and in fact the rest of the world too. In Malawi, for example, we are one of only a few organisations working to help. More on that subject, a microcosm of global challenges and opportunities in energy, in an e-mail in a week or so. Reform of capitalism: Graphic evidence of the need The Bank of England has admitted to fearing, in the current febrile financial climate, that it may not be able to spot the next global crisis coming. Few who studied the forensics of the last one, and the response – or mostly lack thereof – can be surprised. There are obvious candidates for a trigger in the inflated stock market, and mountainous debt in car loans, credit cards, and mortgages. The Brexit gamble is also potentially on the list. The IMF professes that its unpredictable outcome poses a risk to global stability. Given the fact that regulators regard another crisis as inevitable, and see an unreadable multiplicity of potential paths to it, who can realistically contend that the unbridled 21st century version of capitalism is anything close to a satisfactory way to run a global economy today? Root-to-branch reform might take some mapping, but starting points are not too difficult to find. One involves the jailing of executives guilty of gross corruption. Until this starts happening, how there can be hope for wider reform, or the necessary adjustments of cultures? Shell offered up a perfect example this month. The company is under investigation for one of the most corrupt deals in the history of the oil industry.  E-mails show that top executives handed a billion dollars to the Nigerian government, knowing it would be passed to a convicted money-launderer,  in return for a giant oilfield. The CEO of the day, Peter Voser, knew of the deal. The current CEO, ben van Buerden, described the evidence in e-mails as “really unhelpful”, but “just pub talk.” One might hope that if the forces of the law cannot sort out behaviour of this kind., then investors might be queuing to punish a company as wide of the ethical mark as this using their money and governance power. Not on recent evidence from Wall Street. The social media company Snap, owner of a popular photo exchange website, went public in February with investors queuing to pour cash into it. This despite the twenty-something co-founders specifying that investors would have zero voting rights. Far from failing, in the exodus of financial custodians that this dangerous first-of-a-kind should have been faced with, Snap raised $3.4 billion and achieved a valuation of $19.7 billion. As of early March it was worth $28 billion, which would put it in the 100 biggest economies, were it a nation. What a gloomy precedent this now sets for the future. It raises the prospect, in principle, of a small cadre of almost unregulated and unconstrained tech billionaires calling the shots on how the AI and robotics innovations of the next few years are deployed. We had better all hope, if this is the way investors and regulators allow events to unfold, that said billionaires, and investors in them, are not friends of the the populist nationalist right. Yet the way financiers were lining up to engage with Marine Le Pen as the French Presidential election neared suggests we can far from rely on this. Common security: If you elect nationalist demagogues, you will be more likely to experience World War 3 Let me be brief on this final point. In the Trump administration’s handling of Syria and North Korea, where is there any evidence at all of basic statesmanship? Of rudimentary strategy even? Of any thought that there might be lessons to be learned in decades of diplomacy? Ahead of the election, Trump seemed to grasp the inadvisability of poking a hornets nest with a stick, let alone many millions of dollars worth of cruise missiles. “Again, to our very foolish leader”, he tweeted at Obama (all in capital letters), “do not attack Syria – if you do many very bad things will happen.” Suffice it to say that one particularly bad knee-jerk reaction from Trump and/or those he turns into his adversaries, and all bets are off on the balance of play I endeavour to summarise above. A message for my senior grandson, if he made it this far in this blog. Sorry fella, I have been trying for a quarter century. But I and all the people like me have pretty much failed, to date. Hopefully there is some comfort in the thought that we are still trying. 3 Tags: clean energy transition, climate change responses Jeremy Leggett Jeremy Leggett is a social entrepreneur and author.

The annual event brings together entrepreneurs from around the world for 3 days of networking, workshops and conferences. Photographer: David Paul Morris/BloombergMore Larry Page has his flying cars. Sergey Brin shall have an airship. Brin, the Google co-founder, has secretly been building a massive airship inside of Hangar 2 at the NASA Ames Research Center, according to four people with knowledge of the project. It's unclear whether the craft, which looks like a zeppelin, is a hobby or something Brin hopes to turn into a business. "Sorry, I don't have anything to say about this topic right now," Brin wrote in an email. The people familiar with the project said Brin has long been fascinated by airships. His interest in the crafts started when Brin would visit Ames, which is located next to Google parent Alphabet Inc.'s headquarters in Mountain View, California. In the 1930s, Ames was home to the USS Macon, a huge airship built by the U.S. Navy. About three years ago, Brin decided to build one of his own after ogling old photos of the Macon. More from Bloomberg.com: Trump’s Sanctuary Cities Order Blocked by Federal Judge In 2015, Google unit Planetary Ventures took over the large hangars at Ames from NASA and turned them into laboratories for the company. Brin's airship, which isn’t an Alphabet project, is already taking shape inside one. Engineers have constructed a metal skeleton of the craft, and it fills up much of the enormous hangar. Alan Weston, the former director of programs at NASA Ames, is leading Brin's airship project, according to the people, who asked not to be named discussing the secretive plans. Weston didn’t respond to requests for comment. More from Bloomberg.com: Former Fox Host Claims Network Hacked Into Her Computer Weston has a background befitting such an unusual enterprise. Born to Australian parents, Weston spent some of his youth in Turkey and then ended up at the University of Oxford. There he became a key member of the Dangerous Sports Club - a group of very intelligent risk-takers that formed in the early 1970s and did things such as catapult people across fields into nets. Members of the club are credited with inventing the modern form of bungee jumping. Weston, for example, performed one of the first bungee jumps by hurling himself off California’s Golden Gate Bridge and then eluded the authorities waiting to capture him on shore. He also hiked Mt. Kilimanjaro in Africa and then attempted to hang-glide down, only to crash and hurt his ankle in the process. More from Bloomberg.com: Trump Signals Shift on Wall Funding to Avert Government Shutdown Years later, Weston joined the Air Force and did engineering work as part of the U.S. government’s Strategic Defense Initiative - known more broadly as the Star Wars missile defense system. In 1989, Weston oversaw one of the first tests of Star Wars, which aimed to destroy incoming Russian missiles midair with weapons fired from space. Following his stint at the Air Force, Weston joined NASA and worked on a wide number of projects, including the development of a low-cost lunar lander. In a radio interview in 2013, Weston described plans for an airship that could be used to haul cargo. The idea is that airships could be more fuel-efficient than planes and could carry loads directly to where they're needed, rather than to transport centers like airports or shipping stations. "New airship technologies have the promise to reduce the cost of moving things per ton-mile by up to an order of magnitude," Weston said in the interview. "It depends on the size of the airship. A larger airship can reduce costs a lot more than a smaller ship, but there’s design of a class of vehicles that can lift up to 500 tons that could be actually more fuel-efficient than even a truck." He went on to describe a prototype he was considering of a helium-based craft that appeared to breathe. "And so the way that works is that the helium in the main envelope is taken and stored in bags inside the airship at a slightly higher pressure," he said. "As you do that, air is taken in from the outside into essentially like lungs that are attached in the side of the vehicle. So the analogy of breathing is a good one. And the overall lift of the vehicle is equal to the weight of the air that is being displaced by the helium. And as you change that, you can control the amount of buoyancy that the vehicle has." This technique, according to Weston, would allow the airship to carry 500 tons without the need for a ballast. After being contacted about the airship, Weston changed his profile on LinkedIn to list his current job as chief executive officer of ``Ltare.'' He then removed the post.  Read More There have been many attempts to build airships of this type in recent years. It's fitting for such a project to take place in Silicon Valley, which seems to have entered a steampunk phase, as people race to build things ranging from flying cars to tiny reusable rockets. Brin’s airship is separate from a freight project called Calcifer that was shelved by Google X, the company’s experimental research lab, in 2014. Alphabet CEO Page, Brin’s Google co-founder, has funded at least two secretive flying-car projects – startups Kitty Hawk and Zee.Aero, also separate from Alphabet. Page has begun to take the wraps off one of these efforts – on Monday, Kitty Hawk released a video showing one of its all-electric vehicles taking off and soaring over a lake with the driver perched on top. --With assistance from Mark Bergen.

Google posts truly incredible night images captured by the Pixel and Nexus 6P Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/25 11:28am PDTApr 25, 2017 52 Plus 1 on G+ 362 Share on Facebook 96 Share on Twitter Total Shares510 Google News Nexus 6P Pixel Pixel XL Smartphone cameras have come a long way, but can you ever take images that rival a "real" camera? According to Google software engineer Florian Kainz, the answer is yes. Using a custom camera app and some post-capture editing , Kainz shows what the camera sensors in the Pixel and Nexus 6P can do in low light situations. Kainz says his little project was inspired by a chat with Google's Gcam team, which focuses on computational photography. The most visible Gcam contribution to Google's products is HDR+, which allows phones like the Pixel to take photos in dim lighting by combining as many as 10 burst shots. HDR+ isn't perfect, though. Sometimes there just isn't enough light to produce a good image. 64 4-second exposures, shot with Nexus 6P With long exposures and lots of individual images, Kainz reasoned it should be possible to get much better photos out of a smartphone's tiny camera sensor. To test this, he built a simple camera app with manual control over exposure time, ISO, and focus distance. The image at the top of the Point Reyes Lighthouse at night was Kainz's first test. This is a composite of 32 frames at 4-second exposure and ISO 1600, taken with the Nexus 6P. He also covered the lens and captured 32 completely black frames. The RAW image files were exported to Photoshop, where the mean of all 32 photos was computed, then the mean of the 32 black frames was subtracted. Below you can see what one of the individual HDR+ photos looked like. Impressive, no? A single 6P HDR+ frame Kainz did more tests with a variety of editing tricks, which you can read about in the full post. Below are some of the photos taken with the Pixel, but that phone only supports maximum 2-second exposures. Kainz speculates that a longer exposures could allow even better low-light photos on smartphones, assuming the subject is not moving and you have a tripod. Amusingly, the Pixel photos were taken in June and July last year, long before the phone was announced. 64 2-second exposures, shot with Google Pixel Many of the editing tweaks used to produce these images could be automated, too. You could imagine an app for Android or a mode in the camera that does most of this for you. Of course, the processing time for a few dozen RAW files would be rather lengthy on a phone. Maybe it could be built into Google Photos? If you want to see more photos from Kainz's experiments, there's a Google Photos album. 64 2-second exposures, shot with Pixel Source: Google Research Tags camera Google google research hdr nexus 6p photography pixel research subscribe ...

Random! Also, fucking skills of whoever is doing all the post processing in these pics. This ain't special about the Pixel and 6P after all, this post processing algorithm could be applied to any phone's pics. madcanada Any pics. Including a DSLR and night sky shots. Gonna try this weekend. shutUface 6p hdr post processing is really good. Throw the photos in snapseed for a little effect. Ocepi https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/63d92d20e4febf4677fb9a1dbbdd2230d3563bf5f95c0c065225af6ddf0baf25.jpg Milton P. This, I need this in my life!!! I'm dying for long exposure option in my phone. ChronoReverse The Htc 10 hardware can do stuff like this already. Here's a 900 second exposure: https://www.flickr.com/photos/maik_reifschneider/29419144492/ HebeGuess same sensors IMX377 as 5X/6P, different optics (with OIS). Pink tint at lower right corner was IR bleed from Laser Autofocus. James Doyle 64 pictures was all they could take before the 6P immediately shut down, probably while the battery read 35%. Snark aside, at this point I think maybe it's too soon to automate something like this on the phone itself, but this would be an amazing thing that Google Photos's AI could automate for us. David Ruddock Exactly. If you could use a stabilizer/tripod and upload the photos to the cloud. That would be nuts. James Doyle I'm almost there for just HDR+. A half dozen HDR+ images all trying to process brings my phone to a crawl, meaning I can't take any more pictures. Let's calm down the processing until I've stopped taking pics, or offload the work to the cloud. jonzey231 Yep. Totally agree with this statement. Once you've got a pretty dark photo trying to process or two decent images trying to process at once, the phone is basically a brick for the next 30 seconds. TSS TS 'The Cloud' doesn't work that way - Cloud based technologies fall under xaaS (IaaS/SaaS/DaaS) - The most common application is DaaS - Which is the only cloud space Google offers to residential consumers. Even if Google created an IaaS product scope, the limitations of current cell protocols would never allow 'processing' to be handed off to anything. Process threads are computed locally. There is nobody on this planet that has figured out how to parse thread computation over ANY WAN/LAN/Network to a central CPU farm to work out xyz process. The concept would be incredibly inefficient anyways. As the CPU processing the threads would have to process the inbound transaction, process the job, then redistribute back to the client. It would being doing 3-10x the work to say nothing have the transaction congestion, and security issues. Reference : Me, i'm a Sys Engineer/Admin. Toodles. Stuart Anderson His point is they could delay and/or limit the HDR+ work until after he's done taking pictures. And post processing like this doesn't need to be real time anyway. Jake Ashton lol. TSS TS got owned! leave it to the "experts" to think inside the box and just tell people what they can't do. toodles EH101 I think you're misunderstanding. What he means is take the 64 pictures (or 3 for regular HDR), let them all get uploaded as you normally would when you hit wifi, then let Google Photos online do the work to make the final picture. Not let the 'cloud' process something that stays on the device in real time. Google already does this to an extent, letting Google Photos 'read' the images and group them by face etc. Sean Buckman I'm using google pixel and I just keep shooting with no lag. It takes a bit(around 5-10 seconds) after taking the pictures to process the HDR+ but it doesn't slow the phone down. Matt I wonder how long it would take to upload 64 RAW files to the cloud... whispy_snippet With Australia's internet speeds I estimate 231 years and six days. Winston What are you talking about? I was there last year and loved the speeds I could get on LTE. But then again I was on Telstra... whispy_snippet I'm on Telstra too but I wasn't referring to cellular data speeds.

I wouldn't mind the wait if the phone could just do it fo me though. 7-down And yet, Google Camera app will be dry as bones with basic features. JohnyNoLegs It's like Google don't care about features. Like they think people will be happy with the most basic of applications. 2kool4skool ✓ⱽᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵇʸ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Google dumbed-down their apps to be as simple and as barebone as possible because apparently there are people that are scared with having options. These are the same people that call any phone or app that offers more than basic features as "gimmicks". JohnyNoLegs Completely agree. For some reason, there has always been a market for this. Feels to me it's for people who either don't do that much on their phone, or like buying third party apps for some reason. Tom Harman While I like my pixel, I'll stick to my D800e for 99% of my photos. madcanada Lol, I have a Canon 6D and I stick to Nexus 6P for 99% of my photos :D Patrick Comparing a 6D and a D800e is like comparing a Polaroid to a Leica. They're different tools for much different uses. That being said, I'm surprised that the Pixel wouldn't take over for the d800e... The simplicity, man! I don't shoot my d800 for anything but photo shoots now because the Pixel is too easy to get great shots and I don't have to spend hours in post. catalysto In the context of comparing to a smartphone, they are practically the same. Trent It's impressive, of course. But to suggest that even the best software will help a Pixel rival a DSLR is comedic. Good enough for most, they are, but put them up on a big screen next to similar shots from even a Nikon D3300 and the lack of pixels (amongst other things) will show which is better. There's also the small matter of all that editing hassle. Naturally, I shoot RAW with my DSLR, but a little time in Lightroom is generally all that's needed to make a shot pop. I appreciate that I'm being a little over-the-top in my condemnation, image quality/rivaling "real" cameras is about more than just how good something looks on a smartphone display. It's about being able to zoom in without a major loss of quality and casting the image to a TV and it not looking bad at that size. I do like my Pixel very much and it's great for casual shots. A DSLR replacement it is not, however. David Ruddock I think this is mostly about the power of light-gathering and composite HDR even when in use even with a tiny sensor. It bodes well for the future of algorithmic photography if nothing else - as sensors get better and algorithms do, too, we can keep pushing the limits of these already impressive methods. This example just takes it to an extreme as a showcase. madcanada This article is about the algorithm. You can apply the same process to a DSLR image making night sky shots even better. OhYeah! This is basicly only due to the Photo stacking technique. You can tell from the single image that each photo is pretty terrible but once you median stack the photos it can average out all the noise. You could create a photo that looked pretty great from a Galaxy S 3 if you really wanted to. madcanada Yes, that's what I said. OhYeah! Yep you kind of did in a different way. Good job, you can recognize similarities! TechGuy22 yet no one can buy the pixel thank god i was able to sell my 6p for 500 bucks and bought the xl rjyanj "no one can buy the pixel" "i bought the xl" hmm. TechGuy22 https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel_phone?hl=en-US can you buy it there ? that's what i meant dumb ass. i have an XL too. didn't buy it from google. nxtiak XL: Black 32gb and 128gb ships May 4th. Silver 32gb, available now, 128gb 3-4weeks. So Yes? Non XL are all out of stock. Shawn Spring I did the same, dumped the 6P after I had preordered the Pixel XL on launch day. Boy am I glad I did. Stevie_Wonder Shooting RAW (DNG) and manual exposure. Google just told us what we are missing from the Google Camera app. Thank you Google, but we knew that already. Mihai Ionescu What Manual camera app do you reccomend? WittyPixel a post that I made a while back in the 6p XDA forums, enjoy! https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-6p/themes-apps/nexus-6p-manual-camera-recommendations-t3340090 Lizzie McVeigh Adobe's Light Room Camera. You get full control of settings... up to 0.7" of exposure. Random! We desperately need that app you've mentioned, with manual controls for exposure time, aperture and ISO. Scott Olsen There's plenty of them already. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.flavionet.android.camera.pro Mike Or just get any phone that isn't developed by Google. My name is…. the smart choice martesque Like say, the LG V20 camera app. Defenestratus Took this picture on my old Nexus 6P of my neighbor's house the other day while walking the pooch. Moon was right behind the light house. the picture is pretty grainy but still pretty impressive given how dark it was outside (even though it doesn't look like it in the picture, I think Google Photos messed with the settings a bit) https://goo.gl/photos/1VBuUKxRGC7Dutyh7 Rod URL not found Ahamid17 Its a shame I had to give up my 5X for an iPhone because of that boot loop issue other than that I really loved my 5X camera Ahamid17 I would love to see the process in which he combined that 64 and 32 frames to get that result and imagine in the future if your camera app could do that in app instead of doing it on photoshop Tauran This needs to be an automated processing trick on Google photos. HDR is great but people like me don't have time to process photos manually to look this great. WittyPixel Salty post... "This is a composite of 32 frames at 4-second exposure and ISO 1600, taken with the Nexus 6P" realizing google didn't unlock all the capabilities he builds an apps to do so. If google allowed apps to use the sensor to it's full capability then we could do the same and the camera would be truly amazing. Gjorgi Lazarovski I don't get what you're saying but the Camera2 API that's in Android since Lollipop allows this and is fully enabled on both phones. You just need the right app, like Manual Camera from the Play store for example. With a tripod and set of skills in Photoshop you're most likely to get the same results by yourself. Kyle Gospodnetich The Pixel and 6P camera drivers are limited to 2 second exposures max. There are many other phones from other manufacturers that can have much, much longer exposure times set via the Camera2 API. funky There is also a hack on xda to support longer exposures, I guess 4 sec WittyPixel future reference... link or it doesn't exist. and there is not one for the nexus 6p, fyi. WittyPixel camera 2 API does not allow that feature. bobinchicago Hey, my Nexus 6P would take great shots too if the battery life wasn't down to an hour and plunging down to 0 the moment I open the camera app. VAVAMk_2 Get a replacement battery dblock I honestly think even the 6P has a better camera than the S8+. I have only had the phone less than a week, but thus far it seems like the camera just isn't as good, back or front camera for that matter. And it may not be the sensors themselves, but perhaps the software. The Google Camera on the Nexus/Pixel devices is just too damn good. JohnyNoLegs Blind tests put the S8 on almost equal footing of the Pixel. It's all in the software. Hence why it takes so long to process images after you take them. Klugschwaetzer Mhh. I'm wondering why I see no star trails after 2 minutes. Stars should not be round, but elongated. Since they are quite round, it seems that this Mr. Kainz has adjusted for earth's motion somehow. But then the branches of the trees should be blurry. Very strange indeed. ChicagoPete I hope you've taken the last 12 minutes to read the source post for this article. Klugschwaetzer I have. Have you? 64 images with two second exposure each means that not counting an intervall between shots you look at the sky for over 128 seconds. The stars will have moved by that time making a virtual overexposure very difficult. Unless he somehow compensated for that. But I don't see how he could have done that - as I said before. Klugschwaetzer Just read the source article. Thanks for pointing that out. jwildman16 Two seconds, not minutes. NinoBr0wn I've given up hope for Google to update their camera app to something above a passing grade. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good strategy by Google to do night pictures. That minimizes the chance of getting halos in the Pixel pictures. whispy_snippet Haven't you already been completely burnt in a camera debate that forced you to leave the discussion without a reply? Why would you want to do it again? Mix I was like how in the heck can I do this with my Pixel!? ".....he built a simple camera app with manual control over exposure time" Dammit.

The new initiative includes tweaks to the algorithm used by Google to deliver search results, while offering users more options to flag inappropriate content, including for “autocomplete,” or the suggestions Google makes while someone is typing a search query. “Our algorithms help identify reliable sources from the hundreds of billions of pages in our index,” Google vice-president of engineering Ben Gomes said in a blog post. “However, it’s become very apparent that a small set of queries in our daily traffic (around 0.25 per cent), have been returning offensive or clearly misleading content, which is not what people are looking for.” Gomes said that Google is seeking to crack down on “new ways that people try to game the system.” “The most high profile of these issues is the phenomenon of ‘fake news,’ where content on the web has contributed to the spread of blatantly misleading, low quality, offensive or downright false information,” he wrote. Wikipedia founder to fight fake news with Wikitribune “While this problem is different from issues in the past, our goal remains the same - to provide people with access to relevant information from the most reliable sources available.” Both Google and Facebook have taken steps in recent months to curb the spread of hoaxes and misinformation amid concerns these may have influenced voters in the 2016 US election. Both firms have sought to cut off ad revenues to websites that promote false news, but have acknowledged they need to do more. Gomes said the latest effort is part of an ongoing process and includes “real people who assess the quality of Google’s search results” and provide feedback. The tweak in search ranking aims “to help surface more authoritative pages and demote low-quality content,” he added. Gomes said the effort aims to avert incidents that gained notoriety last year such as the high ranking of a website which claimed the Holocaust did not happen. Additionally, Google will make it easier for users to flag inappropriate “autocomplete” suggestions and “snippets” of website after some past embarrassments. “The content that appears in these features is generated algorithmically and is a reflection of what people are searching for and what’s available on the web,” Gomes said. “This can sometimes lead to results that are unexpected, inaccurate or offensive” Gomes said the new system enables users to “inform us directly if you find sensitive or unhelpful content.” “We plan to use this feedback to help improve our algorithms,” he added.   Most Popular Viewed 1 Oops!

The changes have been in the works for 4 months, but Google hadn’t publicly discussed most of them until now. The announcement in a blog post Tuesday reflects Google’s confidence in a new screening system designed to reduce the chances that its influential search engine will highlight untrue stories about people and events, a phenomenon commonly referred to as “fake news.” “It’s not a problem that is going to go all the way to zero, but we now think we can stay a step ahead of things,” said Ben Gomes, Google’s vice president of engineering for search. Autocomplete overhauled Besides taking steps to block fake news from appearing in its search results, Google also has reprogrammed a popular feature that automatically tries to predict what a person is looking for as a search request as being typed. The tool, called “autocomplete,” has been overhauled to omit derogatory suggestions, such as “are women evil,” or recommendations that promote violence. Google also is adding a feedback option that will enable users to complain about objectionable autocomplete suggestions so a person can review the wording. Facebook, where fake news stories and other hoaxes have widely circulated on its social network, also has been trying to stem the tide of misleading information by working with The Associated Press and other news organizations to review suspect stories and set the record straight when warranted. Facebook also has provided its nearly 2 billion users ways to identify posts believed to contain false information, something that Google is now allowing users of its search engine to do for some of the news snippets featured in its results. Reputation Google began attacking fake news in late December after several embarrassing examples of misleading information appeared near the top of its search engine. Among other things, Google’s search engine pointed to a website that incorrectly reported then President-elect Donald Trump had won the popular vote in the U.S. election, that President Barack Obama was planning a coup and that the Holocaust never occurred during World War II. Only about 0.25 percent of Google’s search results were being polluted with falsehoods, Gomes said. But that was still enough to threaten the integrity of a search engine that processes billions of search requests per day largely because it is widely regarded as the internet’s most authoritative source of information. “They have a lot riding on this, reputation wise,” said Lucy Dalglish, who has been tracking the flow of false information as dean of the University of Maryland’s journalism department. “If your whole business model is based on turning up the best search results, but those results turn up stuff that is total crap, where does that get you?” To address the problem, Google began revising the closely guarded algorithms that generate its search with the help of 10,000 people who rate the quality and reliability of the recommendations during tests. Google also rewrote its 140-page book of rating guidelines that help the quality-control evaluators make their assessments. Censorship Fighting fake news can be tricky because in some cases what is viewed as being blatantly misleading by one person might be interpreted as being mostly true by another. If Google, Facebook or other companies trying to block false information err in their judgment calls, they risk being accused of censorship or playing favorites. But doing nothing to combat fake news would probably have caused even bigger headaches. If too much misleading information appears in Google’s search results, the damage could go beyond harm to its reputation for reliability. It could also spook risk-averse advertisers, who don’t want their brands tied to content that can’t be trusted, said Larry Chiagouris, a marketing professor at Pace University in New York. “Fake news is careening out of control in some people’s eyes, so advertisers are getting very skittish about it,” Chiagouris said. “Anything Google can do to show it is trying to put a lid on it and prevent it from getting out of hand, it will be seen as a good thing.” Although it also sells ads on its other services and independently owned websites, Google still makes most of its money from the marketing links posted alongside its search results. Google says its new approach isn’t meant to placate advertisers.

The project is the most comprehensive of its kind in Ohio and Five Rivers is the first park system in the state to participate in Google’s Street view trekker program. In May 2016, volunteers with Dayton Hikers, Outdoor Adventures and Five Rivers donned the Google trekker — equipped with a 15-lens camera that captures 360-degree images—and started walking. They hiked and paddled their way through 600 miles of trails and the Great Miami River to bring the world panoramic street views of the region’s 19 metro parks. “We’re really excited that it’s finally live and the community gets to explore the trail system, water trails, hiking trails, equestrian trails, all through Five Rivers Metroparks, the nation’s largest paved trail of networks, from Piqua to Franklin across towards Columbus and down to Cincinnati all of that is live on Google now,” Five Rivers Metroparks’ Outdoor Recreational Program Director Brent Anslinger said. Anslinger said the newly added feature will further attract people to the region for various outdoor activities now that they can preview it online first. “You’re going to spend hours exploring the trails virtually, but we hope you get out and take that information and experience it in nature as well.  It’s really a tool that will really play off each other and it will help you plan trips,” Anslinger said. The launch come just days before the grand opening celebration of the $4 Million RiverScape River Run Project on May 5 and the International Trails Symposium May 7-10.

Name: Subject: Message: Google posts info on which Chromebooks can or will run Android apps Newsby John Callaham3 hours ago 2 As you may know, Google announced in May 2016 that many Chromebooks and other devices that use the company’s Chrome OS operating system would soon be able to run Android apps from the Google Play Store. Since that announcement at Google I/O nearly a year ago, the company has been slow to add that promised support to those older Chromebooks. Now, the company has updated its Chromium support page with a long list of which Chrome OS devices can, or will, gain Android app support. See also: Samsung Chromebook Pro review February 10, 2017 Here are the Chromebooks and other devices that can already run Android apps with the Chrome OS in its Stable Channel version: Acer Chromebook R11 (CB5-132T, C738T) AOpen Chromebox Mini AOpen Chromebase Mini Asus Chromebook Flip C100PA Google Chromebook Pixel (2015) Samsung Chromebook Plus In addition, the Acer Chromebook R13 (CB5-312T) and the Asus Chromebook Flip C302 are also listed as being able to run Android apps right now, but with Chrome OS in its Beta Channel version. Google adds that if a device is listed in the Beta Channel, it does not mean Android app support will be included for that device in the Stable channel on the next release of Chrome OS. The list also shows over 80 Chrome OS devices that are labeled as “Planned” for adding Android app support. However, there’s no schedule posted for when that will happen for each device. Google does say that it is “continuing to evaluate” more Chrome OS devices that could run Android apps, so if your particular model is not listed, there’s an outside chance it may be included in future updates to the list. Google has already confirmed that all Chromebooks released in 2017 will be able to run Android apps, although that support may not be available out of the box. Is your Chromebooks, Chromebox, or Chromebase on the list to get Android app support? Let us know in the comments!

By Michael Liedtke ASSOCIATED pRESS  April 26, 2017 SAN FRANCISCO — Google has sprinkled some new ingredients into its search engine in an effort to prevent bogus information and offensive suggestions from souring its results. The changes have been in the works for four months, but Google hadn’t publicly discussed most of them until now. The announcement in a blog post Tuesday reflects Google’s confidence in a new screening system designed to reduce the chances that its influential search engine will highlight untrue stories about people and events, a phenomenon commonly referred to as ‘‘fake news.’’ Advertisement ‘‘It’s not a problem that is going to go all the way to zero, but we now think we can stay a step ahead of things,’’ said Ben Gomes, Google’s vice president of engineering for search. Besides taking steps to block fake news from appearing in its search results, Google also has reprogrammed a popular feature that automatically tries to predict what a person is looking for as a search request as being typed. The tool, called ‘‘autocomplete,’’ has been overhauled to omit derogatory suggestions, such as ‘‘are women evil,’’ or recommendations that promote violence.

(Source: AP ) Google has sprinkled some new ingredients into its search engine in an effort to prevent bogus information and offensive suggestions from souring its results. The changes have been in the works for four months, but Google hadn’t publicly discussed most of them until now. The announcement in a blog post Tuesday reflects Google’s confidence in a new screening system designed to reduce the chances that its influential search engine will highlight untrue stories about people and events, a phenomenon commonly referred to as “fake news.” “It’s not a problem that is going to go all the way to zero, but we now think we can stay a step ahead of things,” said Ben Gomes, Google’s vice president of engineering for search. CORRECTING AUTOCOMPLETE Besides taking steps to block fake news from appearing in its search results, Google also has reprogrammed a popular feature that automatically tries to predict what a person is looking for as a search request as being typed. The tool, called “autocomplete,” has been overhauled to omit derogatory suggestions, such as “are women evil,” or recommendations that promote violence. Google also adding a feedback option that will enable users to complain about objectionable autocomplete suggestions so a human can review the wording. Facebook, where fake news stories and other hoaxes have widely circulated on its social network, also has been trying to stem the tide of misleading information by working with The Associated Press and other news organizations to review suspect stories and set the record straight when warranted. Facebook also has provided its nearly 2 billion users ways to identify posts believed to contain false information, something that Google is now allowing users of its search engine to do for some of the news snippets featured in its results. WHY GOOGLE CARES Google began attacking fake news in late December after several embarrassing examples of misleading information appeared near the top of its search engine. Among other things, Google’s search engine pointed to a website that incorrectly reported then President-elect Donald Trump had won the popular vote in the US election , that President Barack Obama was planning a coup and that the Holocaust never occurred during World War II. Only about 0.25 percent of Google’s search results were being polluted with falsehoods, Gomes said. But that was still enough to threaten the integrity of a search engine that processes billions of search requests per day largely because it is widely regarded as the internet’s most authoritative source of information. “They have a lot riding on this, reputation wise,” said Lucy Dalglish, who has been tracking the flow of false information as dean of the University of Maryland’s journalism department. “If your whole business model is based turning up the best search results, but those results turn up stuff that is total crap, where does that get you?” To address the problem, Google began revising the closely guarded algorithms that generate its search with the help of 10,000 people who rate the quality and reliability of the recommendations during tests. Google also rewrote its 140-page book of rating guidelines that help the quality-control evaluators make their assessments. GOOGLE AS REFEREE Fighting fake news can be tricky because in some cases what is viewed as being blatantly misleading by one person might be interpreted as being mostly true by another. If Google, Facebook or other companies trying to block false information err in their judgment calls, they risk being accused of censorship or playing favorites. But doing nothing to combat fake news would probably have caused even bigger headaches. If too much misleading information appears in Google’s search results, the damage could go beyond harm to its reputation for reliability. It could also spook risk-averse advertisers, who don’t want their brands tied to content that can’t be trusted, said Larry Chiagouris, a marketing professor at Pace University in New York. “Fake news is careening out of control in some people’s eyes, so advertisers are getting very skittish about it,” Chiagouris said. “Anything Google can do to show it is trying to put a lid on it and prevent it from getting out of hand, it will be seen as a good thing.” Although it also sells ads on its other services and independently owned websites, Google still makes most of its money from the marketing links posted alongside its search results. Google says its new approach isn’t meant to placate advertisers. For all the latest Tech News, download Indian Express App now Tags: Google No Comments.

ADD TO PORTFOLIO ADD TO WATCHLIST SHARE YOUR OULOOK ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz PEER COMPANIES List your Business on Economictimes.com for Free & Grow your Business List Your Business Find Service Near You Larry Page has his flying cars. Sergey Brin shall have an airship. Brin, the Google co-founder, has secretly been building a massive airship inside of Hangar 2 at the NASA Ames Research Center, according to four people with knowledge of the project. It's unclear whether the craft, which looks like a zeppelin, is a hobby or something Brin hopes to turn into a business. "Sorry, I don't have anything to say about this topic right now," Brin wrote in an email. The people familiar with the project said Brin has long been fascinated by airships. His interest in the crafts started when Brin would visit Ames, which is located next to Google parent Alphabet Inc.'s headquarters in Mountain View, California. In the 1930s, Ames was home to the USS Macon, a huge airship built by the U.S. Navy. About three years ago, Brin decided to build one of his own after ogling old photos of the Macon. In 2015, Google unit Planetary Ventures took over the large hangars at Ames from NASA and turned them into laboratories for the company. Brin's airship, which isn’t an Alphabet project, is already taking shape inside one. Engineers have constructed a metal skeleton of the craft, and it fills up much of the enormous hangar. Alan Weston, the former director of programs at NASA Ames, is leading Brin's airship project, according to the people, who asked not to be named discussing the secretive plans. Weston didn’t respond to requests for comment. Weston has a background befitting such an unusual enterprise. Born to Australian parents, Weston spent some of his youth in Turkey and then ended up at the University of Oxford. There he became a key member of the Dangerous Sports Club - a group of very intelligent risk-takers that formed in the early 1970s and did things such as catapult people across fields into nets. Members of the club are credited with inventing the modern form of bungee jumping. Weston, for example, performed one of the first bungee jumps by hurling himself off California’s Golden Gate Bridge and then eluded the authorities waiting to capture him on shore. He also hiked Mt. Kilimanjaro in Africa and then attempted to hang-glide down, only to crash and hurt his ankle in the process. Years later, Weston joined the Air Force and did engineering work as part of the U.S. government’s Strategic Defense Initiative - known more broadly as the Star Wars missile defense system. In 1989, Weston oversaw one of the first tests of Star Wars, which aimed to destroy incoming Russian missiles midair with weapons fired from space. Following his stint at the Air Force, Weston joined NASA and worked on a wide number of projects, including the development of a low-cost lunar lander. In a radio interview in 2013, Weston described plans for an airship that could be used to haul cargo. The idea is that airships could be more fuel-efficient than planes and could carry loads directly to where they're needed, rather than to transport centers like airports or shipping stations. "New airship technologies have the promise to reduce the cost of moving things per ton-mile by up to an order of magnitude," Weston said in the interview. "It depends on the size of the airship. A larger airship can reduce costs a lot more than a smaller ship, but there’s design of a class of vehicles that can lift up to 500 tons that could be actually more fuel-efficient than even a truck." He went on to describe a prototype he was considering of a helium-based craft that appeared to breathe. "And so the way that works is that the helium in the main envelope is taken and stored in bags inside the airship at a slightly higher pressure," he said. "As you do that, air is taken in from the outside into essentially like lungs that are attached in the side of the vehicle. So the analogy of breathing is a good one. And the overall lift of the vehicle is equal to the weight of the air that is being displaced by the helium. And as you change that, you can control the amount of buoyancy that the vehicle has." This technique, according to Weston, would allow the airship to carry 500 tons without the need for a ballast. After being contacted about the airship, Weston changed his profile on LinkedIn to list his current job as chief executive officer of ``Ltare.'' He then removed the post. There have been many attempts to build airships of this type in recent years. It's fitting for such a project to take place in Silicon Valley, which seems to have entered a steampunk phase, as people race to build things ranging from flying cars to tiny reusable rockets. Brin’s airship is separate from a freight project called Calcifer that was shelved by Google X, the company’s experimental research lab, in 2014. Alphabet CEO Page, Brin’s Google co-founder, has funded at least two secretive flying-car projects – startups Kitty Hawk and Zee.Aero, also separate from Alphabet. Page has begun to take the wraps off one of these efforts – on Monday, Kitty Hawk released a video showing one of its all-electric vehicles taking off and soaring over a lake with the driver perched on top.--With assistance from Mark Bergen.

Google adds Indonesian and eight new Indian languages to its neural machine translation Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/25 6:09pm PDTApr 25, 2017 4 Plus 1 on G+ 20 Share on Facebook 42 Share on Twitter Total Shares66 Google News Last year Google started using their new neural machine translation as a means of improving translations through context. A bit over a month ago Google updated it to work with a few new languages. Today Google has added nine more English pairs of languages to the app: Indonesian, Bengali, Gujarati, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Punjabi, Tamil and Telugu. Google's translation functions, from the one built into Chrome to their Android app, have been tremendously useful tools. I use it on a fairly regular basis here with our work at Android Police, translating foreign press statements or checking sites to confirm details. Even outside of work I've used it when traveling or reading. Google Translate has opened a huge door for communication for all of us, allowing millions or billions of people an easy means to access the information they need, regardless of the language barriers in the way, making the the internet a bilingual place. I don't think we could easily go back to the way things were before its convenience. Now we have 9 new language sets that feature improved translation to and from English. Speakers of these languages can look forward to improved results through Google's enhanced neural machine translation, which makes use of the context of a word within the sentence when translating to produce more grammatical, natural, and fluid text. Furthermore, Google believes the system will improve and learn as it translates, so feel free to exercise it if yours is among the newest additions. Just don't feed it Finnegan's Wake or you'll ruin it for everyone. Source: Google Tags google translate indian indonesian neural machine translation update subscribe ...

By Bloomberg News | Mercury News PUBLISHED: April 25, 2017 at 7:34 pm | UPDATED: April 25, 2017 at 8:03 pm By Ashlee Vance|Bloomberg News Larry Page has his flying cars. Sergey Brin shall have an airship. Brin, the Google co-founder, has secretly been building a massive airship inside of Hangar 2 at the NASA Ames Research Center, according to four people with knowledge of the project. It’s unclear whether the craft, which looks like a zeppelin, is a hobby or something Brin hopes to turn into a business. “Sorry, I don’t have anything to say about this topic right now,” Brin wrote in an email.

His interest in the crafts started when Brin would visit Ames, which is located next to Google parent Alphabet’s headquarters in Mountain View. In the 1930s, Ames was home to the USS Macon, a huge airship built by the U.S. Navy. About three years ago, Brin decided to build one of his own after ogling old photos of the Macon. In 2015, Google unit Planetary Ventures took over the large hangars at Ames from NASA and turned them into laboratories for the company. Brin’s airship, which isn’t an Alphabet project, is already taking shape inside one. Engineers have constructed a metal skeleton of the craft, and it fills up much of the enormous hangar. Google co-founder Sergey Brin. (Kimberly White/Getty Images for Breakthrough Prize)  Alan Weston, the former director of programs at NASA Ames, is leading Brin’s airship project, according to the people, who asked not to be named discussing the secretive plans. Weston didn’t respond to requests for comment. Weston has a background befitting such an unusual enterprise. Born to Australian parents, Weston spent some of his youth in Turkey and then ended up at the University of Oxford. There he became a key member of the Dangerous Sports Club – a group of very intelligent risk-takers that formed in the early 1970s and did things such as catapult people across fields into nets. Members of the club are credited with inventing the modern form of bungee jumping. Weston, for example, performed one of the first bungee jumps by hurling himself off California’s Golden Gate Bridge and then eluded the authorities waiting to capture him on shore. He also hiked Mt. Kilimanjaro in Africa and then attempted to hang-glide down, only to crash and hurt his ankle in the process. Years later, Weston joined the Air Force and did engineering work as part of the U.S. government’s Strategic Defense Initiative – known more broadly as the Star Wars missile defense system. In 1989, Weston oversaw one of the first tests of Star Wars, which aimed to destroy incoming Russian missiles midair with weapons fired from space. Following his stint at the Air Force, Weston joined NASA and worked on a wide number of projects, including the development of a low-cost lunar lander. In a radio interview in 2013, Weston described plans for an airship that could be used to haul cargo. The idea is that airships could be more fuel-efficient than planes and could carry loads directly to where they’re needed, rather than to transport centers like airports or shipping stations. “New airship technologies have the promise to reduce the cost of moving things per ton-mile by up to an order of magnitude,” Weston said in the interview. “It depends on the size of the airship. A larger airship can reduce costs a lot more than a smaller ship, but there’s design of a class of vehicles that can lift up to 500 tons that could be actually more fuel-efficient than even a truck.” He went on to describe a prototype he was considering of a helium-based craft that appeared to breathe. “And so the way that works is that the helium in the main envelope is taken and stored in bags inside the airship at a slightly higher pressure,” he said. “As you do that, air is taken in from the outside into essentially like lungs that are attached in the side of the vehicle. So the analogy of breathing is a good one. And the overall lift of the vehicle is equal to the weight of the air that is being displaced by the helium. And as you change that, you can control the amount of buoyancy that the vehicle has.” This technique, according to Weston, would allow the airship to carry 500 tons without the need for a ballast. After being contacted about the airship, Weston changed his profile on LinkedIn to list his current job as chief executive officer of “Ltare.” He then removed the post. There have been many attempts to build airships of this type in recent years. It’s fitting for such a project to take place in Silicon Valley, which seems to have entered a steampunk phase, as people race to build things ranging from flying cars to tiny reusable rockets. Brin’s airship is separate from a freight project called Calcifer that was shelved by Google X, the company’s experimental research lab, in 2014. Alphabet CEO Page, Brin’s Google co-founder, has funded at least two secretive flying-car projects – startups Kitty Hawk and Zee.Aero, also separate from Alphabet. Page has begun to take the wraps off one of these efforts – on Monday, Kitty Hawk released a video showing one of its all-electric vehicles taking off and soaring over a lake with the driver perched on top.

There are only 200 million Indians who are proficient in English and they are already on the internet," Rajan Anandan, VP for Google's India and South-East Asian operations, told TOI while speaking about the next phase of internet usage growth in India. | Apr 26, 2017, 08.10 AM IST Desi languages have trumped English in internet usage. Hindi and vernacular languages will dominate as more and more Indians go online, spurred by regional content, falling data prices and cheaper smartphones. "English is over. There are only 200 million Indians who are proficient in English and they are already on the internet," Rajan Anandan, VP for Google's India and South-East Asian operations, told TOI while speaking about the next phase of internet usage growth in India. "Almost every new user that is coming online-roughly nine out of ten — are not proficient in English. So, it is fair to say that almost all the growth of usage is coming from non-English users." Google estimates that by 2021, content consumption in Hindi will be bigger than consumption in English. "This is just four years away," Anandan said as he highlighted the pace at which local languages, led by Hindi, are helping people get introduced to the world of online. A study conducted by Google, in partnership with KPMG, highlights the emergence of this trend. "India today has 234 million Indian language users online, compared to 175 million English users," Anandan said, adding that the user base of local languages will continue to grow at 18% annually to reach 534 million in next four years. The study has found that adoption of internet through local languages has been led by services such as messaging (169 million), digital entertainment (167 million), social media (115 million) and online news (106 million). Affordable data has been a major reason behind the growth in internet adoption by people across the languages. The near-disruptive introduction of high-speed 4G mobile services by Reliance Jio — which gave free services for almost seven months — has been a key factor behind rapid adoption of free-flowing internet. Jio's entry has led to fall in data tariffs plans across telecom companies. Fall in handset prices and entry of low-priced sophisticated devices have also boosted user experience, prompting a larger population to increasingly access the internet. "Our study reveals that 99% of local-language users access internet through mobile devices. Share of Indians accessing internet through mobile (including English) is 78%," Anandan said, adding that there is a need to have a further reduction in prices of smartphones. "For this growth to continue, you need good-quality smartphones at Rs 3,000, and even lower at Rs 2,000." Adoption of internet is highest among local languages such as Tamil, Hindi, Kannada, Bengali, Marathi, Telugu, Gujarati and Malayalam. The Google-KPMG study estimates that Marathi, Bengali, Tamil and Telugu will form 30% of the total local-language user base in the country. "The consumption in local languages is going to be explosive. However, there is not enough content which is being created right now."

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Google Maps For iOS Gets Parking Reminders By Tyler Lee on 04/25/2017 20:05 PDT Earlier this year Google Maps introduced a new feature to its app that allowed users to remember where they parked. This is versus more traditional methods where users would take photos to remember their parking spots. However the feature was only launched for Android at that time. For iOS users who have been missing out, not to fear as Google has announced that the parking reminder feature is now available on the iOS version of the app. According to Google, the experience offered is pretty much the same as the version on Android. “Tap on the blue dot and then tap on “Set as parking location” to add your parking spot to the map itself. Tap on the parking label on the map to open up your parking card and do things like share it with friends and view pictures of your parking area.” Google also reminds users that this is in addition to the automatic parking detection built into the app. There is also the added convenience if your phone were to be connected to your car via USB audio or Bluetooth. “If you connect to your car using USB audio or bluetooth, your parking spot will be automatically added to the map when you disconnect and exit the vehicle.” The feature should already be live so you’ll want to update your app if you haven’t done so already. Note that Apple Maps already offers up a similar feature but if you’re more of a Google Maps kind of person then this update will be a much-welcome one. Filed in Apple >Cellphones.

Applications Of Machine Learning For Designers By Lassi Liikkanen April 24th, 2017 Experience DesignProcessProduct Strategy 0 Comments As a designer, you will be facing more demands and opportunities to work with digital systems that embody machine learning. To have your say about how best to use it, you need a good understanding about its applications and related design patterns. This article illustrates the power of machine learning through the applications of detection, prediction and generation. It gives six reasons why machine learning makes products and services better and introduces four design patterns relevant to such applications. To help you get started, I have included two non-technical questions that will help with assessing whether your task is ready to be learned by a machine.

Where Are We Heading?4 Big Data, Small Intelligence Link Big data and big promises. We are expecting a great many things to happen once the big data deluge has been funnelled into a nurturing stream of bits. Data can be used in many ways. One is to build smart products, and another is to make better design and business decisions. The latter also, ultimately, trickle into products. Machine learning is a very promising approach radically shaping future product and service development. Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence. It employs many methods: Deep learning and neural networks are two well-known instances. Machine learning means that, instead of programmers providing computers with very detailed instructions on how to perform a task, computers learn the task by themselves. A recent, remarkable milestone was when Google’s AlphaGo software learned to master the game of Go at the level of a world champion! Pretty much anything that a normal person can do in <1 sec, we can now automate with AI. – Andrew Ng (@AndrewYNg), 19 October 20165 This story will lead you into problem discovery through examples of what sorts of problems machines today readily chew on. A basic understanding of machine learning, commonly known as ML, will help. If you are unfamiliar with ML, I suggest you read my friendly introduction6 to the topic or Nvidia’s clear explanation7 of the differences between ML, AI and deep learning. Why Do I Need To Understand The Applications Of Machine Learning? Link As a designer, you will be facing more demands and opportunities to work with digital systems that embody machine learning. As the hype around machine intelligence intensifies, this will lead to technology-driven pressure to extensively utilize machine learning. This may happen with little understanding of its actual benefits and its impact on product desirability and customer experience. Stay on Top of the Machine-Intelligence Game! Link As a designer, to have your say about any plans for machine intelligence and how it is best implemented on the human interface layer, you need to know what it can do and how digital services can utilize it. This post provides an overview of applications, with concrete examples, as well new design guidelines that you can put to work. This will help with making actual design decisions and identifying the right design patterns, including situations when no directly applicable solution exists and you must transfer ideas across domains. Get To The Core Of The Problem Link To exploit the capability of machine learning, you must grasp the nature of a task as a computer might see it. The concept I’ll use to describe it is the core problem of learning. This refers to defining what exactly we would like the computer to learn in order for it to complete the task we have assigned to it. These goals are not always evident at the practical, holistic level of a finished product (say, Tesla’s autopilot function). This story will help you to see what goes on under the surface. Say you want the computer to drive your car. This is a very high abstraction level learning goal. We need to go further down and break it into smaller chunks. We need to ask questions such as, can the computer accelerate and decelerate, and can the machine recognize red and green lights? To identify the core problem is already a move towards understanding whether the overarching task is a good fit for a machine to learn. Once the core problem of learning is defined well, then it is possible to say whether the ML computers of today can solve it with adequate accuracy and in a decent amount of time. This is what matters most for actually making the application work. 8 Small autonomous buses (in the background) started operating on Aalto University Espoo campus in autumn 2016. The street sign warns about their presence, reminiscent of the first automobiles in the 19th century. (Picture of Project Sohjoa9 demonstration in Espoo. Copyright Metropolia UAS, used with permission.) (View large version10) What Good Will Machines Do For You? Link Suppose you manage to teach some skill to a machine. How would your product or service benefit from it? Here are six possible benefits: augment, automate, enable, reduce costs, improve safety, create. In rare cases, machine learning might enable a computer to perform tasks that humans simply can’t perform because of speed requirements or the scale of data. But most of the time, ML helps to automate repetitive, time-consuming tasks that defy the limits of human labor cost or attentional span. For instance, sorting through recycling waste 24/7 is more reliably and affordably done by a computer. In some areas, machine learning may offer a new type of expert system that augments and assists humans. This could be the case in design, where a computer might make a proposal for a new layout or color palette aligned with the designer’s efforts. Google Slides already offers this type of functionality through the suggested layouts feature11. Augmenting human drivers would improve traffic safety if a vehicle could, for example, start braking before the human operator could possibly react, saving the car from a rear-end collision. 12 (Large preview13) Google Slides provides design assistance via the Explore function. Right pane demonstrates the variations it has generated from elements initially composed by the user. What Have Machines Learned So Far? Link In 2016, the most celebrated milestone of machine learning was AlphaGo’s victory14 over the world champion of Go, Lee Sedol15. Considering that Go is an extremely complicated game to master, this was a remarkable achievement. Beyond exotic games such as Go, Google Image Search is maybe the best-known application of machine learning. Search feels so natural and mundane when it effectively hides away all of the complexity is embeds. With over 30 billion search queries every day, Google Image Search constantly gets more opportunities to learn. There are already more individual machine learning applications than are reasonable to list here. But a major simplification16 is not sufficient either, I feel. One way to appreciate the variety is to look at successful ML applications from Eric Siegel’s book Predictive Analytics from 2013. The listed applications fall under the following domains: marketing, advertising and the web; financial risk and insurance; healthcare; crime fighting and fraud detection; fault detection for safety and efficiency; government, politics, nonprofit and education; human-language understanding, thought and psychology; staff and employees, human resources. His cross-industry collection of examples is a powerful illustration of the omnipresence of predictive applications, even though not all of his 147 examples utilize machine learning as we know it. However, for a designer, knowing whether your problem domain is among the nine listed will give an idea of whether machine learning has already proven to be useful or whether you are facing a great unknown. Machines Learn Detection, Prediction And Creativity Link As I see it, the power of learning algorithms comes down to two major applications: detection and prediction. Detection is about interpreting the present, and prediction is about the way of the future. Interestingly, machines can also do generative or “creative” tasks. However these are still a marginal application. 17 Three main categories of ML applications and their common use cases (View large version18) When you combine detection and prediction, you can achieve impressive overall results. For instance, combine the detection of traffic signs, vehicles and pedestrians with the prediction of vehicular and pedestrian movements and of the times to vehicle line crossings, and you have the makings of an autonomous vehicle! This is my preferred way of thinking about machine learning applications. In practice, detection and prediction are sometimes much alike because they don’t yet cut into the heart and bones of machine learning (recall the basics of machine learning19), but I believe they offer an appropriate level of abstraction to talk about machine learning applications. Let’s clarify these functions through examples. The Varieties of Detection Link There are at least four major types of applications of detection. Each deals with a different core learning problem. They are: text and speech interpretation, image and sound interpretation, human behavior and identity detection, abuse and fraud detection. Text and Speech Interpretation Link Text and speech are the most natural interaction and communication methods. Thus, it has not been feasible in the realm of computers. Previous generations of voice dialling and interactive voice response systems were not very impressive. Only in this decade have we seen a new generation of applications that take spoken commands and even have a dialogue with us! This can go so smoothly that we can’t tell computers and humans apart in text-based chats, indicating that computers have passed the Turing test20. Dealing with speech, new systems such as personal assistant Siri or Amazon’s Echo device are capable of interpreting a wide range of communications and responding intelligently. The technical term for this capability is natural language processing (NLP). This indicates that, based on successful text and speech detection (i.e. recognition), computers can also interpret the meaning of words, spoken and written, and take action. Text interpretation enables equally powerful applications. The detection of emotion, or sentiment, from text means that large masses of text can be automatically analyzed to reveal what people in social media think about brands, products or presidential candidates. For instance, Google Translate just recently witnessed significant quality improvements21 by switching to an ML approach to translations. 22 Amazon Echo Dot is surfacing as one of the best-selling speech-recognition-driven appliances of early 2017. (View large version23) Jeff Bezos says the Echo “isn’t about” getting people to shop on Amazon, and he may be right https://t.co/UuDdAms0Yt24 pic.twitter.com/erodS8hoJg25 – BI Tech (@SAI) 13 February 201726 Image and Sound Interpretation Link Computer vision gives metaphorical eyes to a machine. The most radical example of this is a computer reconstruction of human perception from brain scans! However, that is hardly as useful an application as one that automates the tagging of photos or videos to help you explore Google Photos or Facebook. The latter service recognizes faces to an even scary level of accuracy. Image interpretation finds many powerful business applications in industrial quality control, recording vehicle registration plates, analyzing roadside photos for correct traffic signs, and monitoring empty parking spaces. The recent applications of computer vision to skin cancer diagnosis27 have actually proven more proficient than human doctors, leading to the discovery of new diagnostic criteria! 28 A search for “dog” in my personal Google Photos collection brings up several correct instances of dogs I’ve chanced upon, but also a few false positives. However, I’ve never tagged a single dog, so the noise is acceptable given the added value of finding any dogs. (Screenshot from February 2017, edited to remove personal information (albums).) (View large version29) Speech was already mentioned, but other audio signals are also well detected by computers. Shazam and SoundHound have for years provided reliable detection of songs either from a recording fragment or a sung melody. The Fraunhofer Institute developed the Silometer30, an app to detect varieties of coughs as a precursor to medical diagnosis. I would be very surprised if we don’t see many new applications for human and non-human sounds in the near future. Human Behavior and Identity Detection Link Given that computers are seeing and hearing what we do, it is not surprising that they have became capable of analyzing and detecting human behavior and identity as well — for instance, with Microsoft Kinect recognizing our body motion. Machines can identify movements in a football game to automatically generate game statistics. Apple’s iPad Pro recognizes31 whether the user is using their finger or the pencil for control, to prevent unwanted gestures. A huge number of services detect what kind of items typically go together in a shopping cart; this enables Amazon to suggest that you might also be interested in similar products. In the world of transportation, it would be a major safety improvement if we could detect when a driver is about to fall asleep behind the steering wheel, to prevent traffic accidents. Identity detection is another valuable function enabled by several signals. A Japanese research institute has developed a car seat32 that recognizes who’s sitting in it. Google’s reCAPTCHA33 is a unique system that tells apart humans from spam bots. Perhaps the most notorious example of guessing people’s health was Target’s successful detection of expectant mothers34. This was followed by a marketing campaign that awkwardly disclosed the pregnancy of Target customers, resulting in much bad publicity. 35 Google’s reCAPTCHA has simplified spam-fighting in web forms with the help of micro-intelligence from machine learning. Anti-Virus, Anti-Spam, Anti-Malware Link Machine learning is also used to detect and prevent fraudulent, abusive or dangerous content and schemes. It is not always major attacks; sometimes it is just about blocking bad checks or preventing petty criminals from entering the NFL’s Superbowl arena36. The best successes are found in anti-spam; for instance, Google has been doing an excellent job for years of filtering spam from your Gmail inbox. I will conclude with a good-willed detection example from the normal human sphere. Whales can be reliably recognized37 from underwater recordings of their sounds — once more, thanks to machine learning. This can help human-made fishing machinery to avoid contact with whales38 for their protection. 39 This humpback whale would be all the merrier if all fishing boats were equipped with machine-learning technology to detect their signals. (View large version40) Design Pattern: Suggested Features Text and speech prediction have opened up new opportunities for interaction with smart devices. Conversational interfaces are the most prominent example of this development, but definitely not the only one. As we try to hide the interface and underlying complexity from users, we are balancing between what we hide and what we reveal. Suggested features help users to discover what the invisible UI is capable of. Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) have made computing accessible for the better part of the human race that enjoys normal vision. GUIs provided a huge usability improvement in terms of feature discovery. Icon and menus were the first useful metaphors for direct manipulation of digital objects using a mouse and keyboard. With multitouch screens, we have gained the new power of pinching, dragging and swiping to interact. Visual clues aren’t going anywhere, but they are not going to be enough when interaction modalities expand. How Does a User Find Out What Your Service Can Do? Link Haptic interaction in the first consumer generation of wearables and in the foremost conversational interfaces presents a new challenge for feature discovery. Non-visual cues must be used that facilitate the interaction, particularly at the very onset of the interactive relationship. Feature suggestions — the machine exposing its features and informing the user what it is capable of — are one solution to this riddle. In the case of a chatbot employed for car rentals, this could be, “Please ask me about available vehicles, upgrades and your past reservations.” Specific application areas come with specific, detailed patterns. For instance, Patrick Hebron’s recent ebook41 from O’Reilly contains a great discussion of the solutions for conversational interfaces. Species Of Prediction Link Several generations of TV watchers have been raised to watch weather forecasts for fun, ever since regular broadcasts began after the Second World War42. The realm of prediction today is wide and varied. Some applications may involve non-machine learning parts that help in performing predictions. Here I will focus on the prediction of human activities, but note that the prediction of different non-human activities is currently gaining huge interest. Predictive maintenance of machines and devices is one such application, and more are actively envisioned as the Internet of Things generates more data to learn from. Predicting different forms of human behavior falls roughly into the following core learning challenges and applications: recommendations, individual behavior and condition, collective behavior prediction. Different types of recommendations are about predicting user preferences. When Netflix recommends a movie or Spotify generates a playlist of your future favorite music, they are trying to predict whether you will like it, watch it or listen through to the end of the piece. Netflix is on the lookout for your rating of the movie afterwards, whereas Spotify or Pandora might measure whether you are returning to enjoy the same song over and over again without skipping. This way, our behaviors and preferences become connected even without our needing to express them explicitly. This is something machines can learn about and exploit. In design, predicting which content or which interaction models appeal to users could give rise to the personalization of interfaces. This is mostly based on predicting which content a user would be most interested in. For a few years now, Amazon has been heavily personalizing the front page, predicting what stuff and links should be present in anticipation of your shopping desires and habits. Recommendations are a special case of predicting individual behavior. The scope of predictions does not end with trivial matters, such as whether you like Game of Thrones or Lady Gaga. Financial institutions attempt to predict who will default on their loan or try to refinance it. Big human-resource departments might predict employee performance and attrition. Hospitals might predict the discharge of a patient or the prognosis of a cancer. Rather more serious humans conditions, such as divorce, premature birth and even death within a certain timeframe, have been all been predicted with some success. Of course, predicting fun things can get serious when money is involved, as when big entertainment companies try to guess which songs43 and movies will top the charts to direct their marketing and production efforts. 44 Microsoft’s ML platform demonstrator How Old Do I Look?45 guesses age (a human condition) based on any uploaded photo or search. The important part about predictions is that they lead to individual assessment that are actionable. The more reliable the prediction and the weightier the consequences, the more profitable and useful the predictions become. Predicting collective behavior becomes a generalization of individuals but with different implications and scope. In these cases, intervention is only successful if it affects most of the crowd. The looming result of a presidential election, cellular network use or seasonal shopping expenditure can all be subject to prediction. When predicting financial risk or a company’s key performance indicators, the gains of saving or making money are noticeable. J.P. Morgan Chase was one of the first banks to increase efficiency by predicting mortgage defaulters (those who never pay back) and refinancers (those who pay back too early). On the other hand, the recent US presidential election is a good reminder that none of this is yet perfect. In a close resemblance to tools for antivirus and other present dangers, future trouble is also predictable. Predictive policing is about forecasting where street conflicts might happen or where squatters are taking over premises, which would help administrators to distribute resources to the right places. A similar process is going on in energy companies, as they try to estimate the capacity needed to last the night. Design Pattern: Personalization Once a computer gets to know you and to predict your desires and preferences, it can start to serve you in new, more effective ways. This is personalization, the automated optimization of a service. Responsive website layouts are a crude way of doing this. The utilization of machine learning features with interfaces could lead to highly personalized user experiences. Akin to giving everyone a unique desktop and homescreen, services and apps will start to adapt to people’s preferences as well. This new degree of personalization presents opportunities as well as forces designers to flex their thoughts on how to create truly adaptive interfaces that are largely controlled by the logic of machine learning. If you succeed in this, you will reward users with a superior experience and will impart a feeling of being understood46. 47 Amazon.com’s front page has been personalized for a long time. The selection offered to me looks somewhat relevant, if not attractive. (View large version48) Currently, personalization is foremost applied in order to curate content. For instance, Amazon carefully considers which products would appeal to potential buyers on its front page. But it will not end with that. Personalization will likely lead to much bigger changes across UIs — for instance, even in the presentation of the types of interactive elements a user likes to use. Questions To Ask In Considering The Fit Of Machine Learning Link Say you are now convinced that your users and customers would benefit from a ML-boosted service. Next, you must consider the business and technology perspectives. The first question to ask is, If ML works at least as well as you want, what value would it add to your product? Be honest: Traditional business logic applies here, too. If machine learning doesn’t create value, then it is probably a waste of resources. Marketing people might fancy your new implementation, but the business folks will not necessarily fund your next machine learning experiment unless you have a business case for why machine learning would improve the customer experience or revenue directly. OK, suppose you’ve cleared the viability check box. I expect you also have at least a hypothesis of the core learning challenge. This might be, for example, Can a computer learn to predict when the user would need to take an umbrella or a waterproof jacket when they leave the house in the morning. Next, you’ll need to figure out whether you can expect the machine to learn the job you wish to get done. We’ve come to matters of data. Data broadly refers to any information you can feed the computer: weather data, shopping data for umbrellas and waterproof gear, social media updates and so forth. Here are two simple diagnostic questions to assess the data situation: Do we have enough examples for the machine to learn from? Are there patterns in the teaching material that can be recognized by a human expert? The first question looks easy but is difficult to answer in advance. You need both good quality and a sufficient quantity of data. Some signals are noisy (that is, have poor quality). You might need more examples in these cases than in others. Some features are very prominent and easy to learn, such as in the case of detecting nighttime or daytime in photos. This can be solved with as few as 30 training images49! Typical applications require thousands of instances of input data and possibly the desired answers. The more complicated the task, the more material will be needed. AlphaGo learned to master the game after analyzing a staggering 30 million games50 and then playing some against itself! This is likely excessive in most situations, but it gives you an idea of the scale of what computers can and may need to swallow — from 30 to 30 million. This is one of the reasons why increasing computing capacity and certain hardware really makes computers smarter by speeding up the learning of truly big data. 51 The complexity of Go pushed machine learning capacity to its extremes. Playing the game at random, or by brute force, would be futile. (Image: YouTube52) (View large version53) The second question is, Are there patterns in the teaching material that can be recognized by a human expert? If a human can do the task, then there’s a fair chance that there are regularities in the data that might be picked up by the computer as well. If you have a positive answer to least one of the questions, you can go forward with some confidence that machine learning might indeed be of use to you. What you’d do after this discovery is mostly beyond the scope of this article. In order to build a machine learning solution, it is best to boldly go and prototype your desired functionality. If you have enough samples, your data scientist teammate will quickly discover whether the machine shows proficiency in the learning task (particularly if you use scalable could computing). If not, you’ll need to get more data. What follows is a series of iterations on the learning mechanisms and a process of integrating it with the product or service. The appearance of intelligent applications can be achieved by carefully putting together several pieces of machine learning and even conventional programming. This is called an ensemble approach. What at best appears as a seamless interactive experience for the user may in fact be the product of a very complex rubric of different machine learning components working together. Human intelligence is heavily needed to tweak the learning algorithms. Such was the architecture underlying Watson54, the Jeopardy-winning artificial intelligence system created by IBM and the algorithm that claimed the Netflix Prize55. In the latter competition, several teams combined their individual tweaks during the final months of the competition to eventually exceed the criteria for success. This is also what the Google Translate team did to ascend to the next level. And that work is something I consider to fall under the domain of traditional software development. New Design Patterns For Creating Interfaces Of Machine Learning Applications! Link 56 Illustration: Joonas Haverinen, SC5 (Large preview57) Thus far, I’ve talked about the possibilities of machine learning and given some practical advice on how to figure out its feasibility. I’ve also introduced two general design patterns that are tightly connected to machine learning. However, they are not enough. A designer engaged in service and interface design will have several questions concerning interaction in their mind by now. How can we and will we communicate machine intelligence to users, and what kinds of new interfaces will machine learning call for? This entails both opportunities to do things in a new way, as well as requirements for new designs. To me, this means we will need a rise in importance of several design patterns or, rather, abstract design features, which will become important as services get smarter. They include: suggested features, personalization, shortcuts versus granular controls, graceful failure. I have already covered suggested features58 and personalization59 as a part of detection and prediction, but what are granularity and graceful failure? Design Pattern: Shortcuts Versus Granularity Link Photoshop is an excellent example of a tool with a steep learning curve and a great deal of granularity in controlling what can be done. Most of the time, you work on small operations, each of which has a very specific influence. The creative combination of many small things allows for interesting patterns to emerge on a larger scale. Holistic, black-box operations such as transformative filters and automatic corrections are not really the reason why professionals use Photoshop. What will happen when machines learn to predict what we are doing repeatedly? For instance, I frequently perform certain actions in Photoshop before uploading my photos to a blog. While I could manually automate this, creating yet another user-defined feature among thousands already in the product, Photoshop might learn to predict my intentions and offer a more prominent shortcut, or a highway, to fast-forward me to my intended destination. As Adobe currently puts effort into bringing AI into Creative Cloud, we’ll likely see something even more clever than this very soon. It is up to you to let the machine figure out the appropriate shortcuts in your application. 60 A mockup of a possible implementation of “predictive history” in Photoshop CC. The application suggests a possible future state for the user based on the user’s history and preceding actions and on the current image. (View large version61) A funny illustration of a similar train of thought comes from Cristopher Hesse’s machine-learning-based image-to-image translation62, which provides interesting content-specific filling of doodles. Similar to Photoshop’s content-aware fill, it creates most hilarious visualizations of building facades, cats, shoes and bags based on minimal user input. 63 The edges2cats algorithm employs machine learning to finish your cat doodle as a photorealistic cat monster. (View large version64) Design Pattern: Graceful Failure Link I call the final pattern graceful failure. It means saying “sorry, I can’t do what you want because…” in an understandable way. This is by no means unique to machine learning applications. It is innately human, but something that computers have been notoriously bad at since the time that syntax errors were repeatedly echoed by Commodore computers in the 1980s. But with machine learning, it’s slightly different. Because machine learning takes a fuzzy-logic approach to computing, there are new ways that the computer could produce unexpected results — that is, things could go very bad, and that has to be designed for. Nobody seriously blames the car in question for the death that occurred in the Tesla autopilot accident in 2016. The other part is that building applications that rely on modern machine learning is still in its infancy. Classic software development has been around for so long that we’ve learned to deal with its insufficiencies better. As Peter Norvig, famous AI researcher and Google’s research director, puts it like this65: The problem here is the methodology for scaling this up to a whole industry is still in progress.… We don’t have the decades of experience that we have in developing and verifying regular software. The nature of learning is such that computers learn from what is given to them. If the algorithm has to deal with something else, then the results will not be to your liking. For example, if you’ve trained a system to detect animal species from pet photos and then start using it to classify plants, there will be trouble. This is more or less why Microsoft’s Twitterbot Tay had to be silenced66 after it picked up the wrong examples from malicious users when exposed to real-world conditions. The uncertainty in detection and prediction should be taken into consideration. How this is done depends on the application. Consider Google Search. No one is offended or truly hurt, but merely amused or frustrated, by bad search results. Of course, bad results will eventually be bad for business. However, if your bank started using a chatbot that suddenly could not figure out your checking account’s balance, you would be rightfully worried and should be offered a quick way to resolve your trouble. To deal with failure, interfaces would do well to help both parties adjust. Users can tolerate one or two “I didn’t get that, please say that again” prompts (but no more) if that’s what it takes to advance the dialogue. For services that include machine learning, extensive testing is best. Next comes informing users about the probability and consequences of failure, and instructions on what the user might do to avoid it. The good practices are still emerging. Summary Link With machine learning, our vision of tomorrow is quickly becoming today’s reality. Overall, there hardly seems to be an application that machine learning could not be used to detect or predict. I’ve introduced plenty of examples of deploying machine learning to varying success. In all of the examples, I’ve tried to illustrate some core learning challenge to help you understand what sorts of tasks machines respond to. Now it is time to face the question of what machine learning can do for you! I don’t expect that this guide alone will suffice for radical innovation in the sphere of intelligent products and services. I do hope that it will open the eyes of several designers to the opportunities that machine learning solutions afford us today. It is important to understand approximately what you can realistically ask from a machine. In the near future, good questions will become ever more important, so that the answer will be, “Yes, Dave. I can do that.” Thanks to Max Pagels, Janne Aukia, Antti Rauhala, Teemu Kinnunen and Patrick Hebron for discussing the topic.

Google posts truly incredible night images captured by the Pixel and Nexus 6P Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/25 11:28am PDTApr 25, 2017 52 Plus 1 on G+ 362 Share on Facebook 96 Share on Twitter Total Shares510 Google News Nexus 6P Pixel Pixel XL Smartphone cameras have come a long way, but can you ever take images that rival a "real" camera? According to Google software engineer Florian Kainz, the answer is yes. Using a custom camera app and some post-capture editing , Kainz shows what the camera sensors in the Pixel and Nexus 6P can do in low light situations. Kainz says his little project was inspired by a chat with Google's Gcam team, which focuses on computational photography. The most visible Gcam contribution to Google's products is HDR+, which allows phones like the Pixel to take photos in dim lighting by combining as many as 10 burst shots. HDR+ isn't perfect, though. Sometimes there just isn't enough light to produce a good image. 64 4-second exposures, shot with Nexus 6P With long exposures and lots of individual images, Kainz reasoned it should be possible to get much better photos out of a smartphone's tiny camera sensor. To test this, he built a simple camera app with manual control over exposure time, ISO, and focus distance. The image at the top of the Point Reyes Lighthouse at night was Kainz's first test. This is a composite of 32 frames at 4-second exposure and ISO 1600, taken with the Nexus 6P. He also covered the lens and captured 32 completely black frames. The RAW image files were exported to Photoshop, where the mean of all 32 photos was computed, then the mean of the 32 black frames was subtracted. Below you can see what one of the individual HDR+ photos looked like. Impressive, no? A single 6P HDR+ frame Kainz did more tests with a variety of editing tricks, which you can read about in the full post. Below are some of the photos taken with the Pixel, but that phone only supports maximum 2-second exposures. Kainz speculates that a longer exposures could allow even better low-light photos on smartphones, assuming the subject is not moving and you have a tripod. Amusingly, the Pixel photos were taken in June and July last year, long before the phone was announced. 64 2-second exposures, shot with Google Pixel Many of the editing tweaks used to produce these images could be automated, too. You could imagine an app for Android or a mode in the camera that does most of this for you. Of course, the processing time for a few dozen RAW files would be rather lengthy on a phone. Maybe it could be built into Google Photos? If you want to see more photos from Kainz's experiments, there's a Google Photos album. 64 2-second exposures, shot with Pixel Source: Google Research Tags camera Google google research hdr nexus 6p photography pixel research subscribe ...

Random! Also, fucking skills of whoever is doing all the post processing in these pics. This ain't special about the Pixel and 6P after all, this post processing algorithm could be applied to any phone's pics. madcanada Any pics. Including a DSLR and night sky shots. Gonna try this weekend. shutUface 6p hdr post processing is really good. Throw the photos in snapseed for a little effect. Ocepi https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/63d92d20e4febf4677fb9a1dbbdd2230d3563bf5f95c0c065225af6ddf0baf25.jpg Milton P. This, I need this in my life!!! I'm dying for long exposure option in my phone. ChronoReverse The Htc 10 hardware can do stuff like this already. Here's a 900 second exposure: https://www.flickr.com/photos/maik_reifschneider/29419144492/ HebeGuess same sensors IMX377 as 5X/6P, different optics (with OIS). Pink tint at lower right corner was IR bleed from Laser Autofocus. James Doyle 64 pictures was all they could take before the 6P immediately shut down, probably while the battery read 35%. Snark aside, at this point I think maybe it's too soon to automate something like this on the phone itself, but this would be an amazing thing that Google Photos's AI could automate for us. David Ruddock Exactly. If you could use a stabilizer/tripod and upload the photos to the cloud. That would be nuts. James Doyle I'm almost there for just HDR+. A half dozen HDR+ images all trying to process brings my phone to a crawl, meaning I can't take any more pictures. Let's calm down the processing until I've stopped taking pics, or offload the work to the cloud. jonzey231 Yep. Totally agree with this statement. Once you've got a pretty dark photo trying to process or two decent images trying to process at once, the phone is basically a brick for the next 30 seconds. TSS TS 'The Cloud' doesn't work that way - Cloud based technologies fall under xaaS (IaaS/SaaS/DaaS) - The most common application is DaaS - Which is the only cloud space Google offers to residential consumers. Even if Google created an IaaS product scope, the limitations of current cell protocols would never allow 'processing' to be handed off to anything. Process threads are computed locally. There is nobody on this planet that has figured out how to parse thread computation over ANY WAN/LAN/Network to a central CPU farm to work out xyz process. The concept would be incredibly inefficient anyways. As the CPU processing the threads would have to process the inbound transaction, process the job, then redistribute back to the client. It would being doing 3-10x the work to say nothing have the transaction congestion, and security issues. Reference : Me, i'm a Sys Engineer/Admin. Toodles. Stuart Anderson His point is they could delay and/or limit the HDR+ work until after he's done taking pictures. And post processing like this doesn't need to be real time anyway. Jake Ashton lol. TSS TS got owned! leave it to the "experts" to think inside the box and just tell people what they can't do. toodles EH101 I think you're misunderstanding. What he means is take the 64 pictures (or 3 for regular HDR), let them all get uploaded as you normally would when you hit wifi, then let Google Photos online do the work to make the final picture. Not let the 'cloud' process something that stays on the device in real time. Google already does this to an extent, letting Google Photos 'read' the images and group them by face etc. Sean Buckman I'm using google pixel and I just keep shooting with no lag. It takes a bit(around 5-10 seconds) after taking the pictures to process the HDR+ but it doesn't slow the phone down. Matt I wonder how long it would take to upload 64 RAW files to the cloud... whispy_snippet With Australia's internet speeds I estimate 231 years and six days. Winston What are you talking about? I was there last year and loved the speeds I could get on LTE. But then again I was on Telstra... whispy_snippet I'm on Telstra too but I wasn't referring to cellular data speeds.

I wouldn't mind the wait if the phone could just do it fo me though. 7-down And yet, Google Camera app will be dry as bones with basic features. JohnyNoLegs It's like Google don't care about features. Like they think people will be happy with the most basic of applications. 2kool4skool ✓ⱽᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵇʸ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Google dumbed-down their apps to be as simple and as barebone as possible because apparently there are people that are scared with having options. These are the same people that call any phone or app that offers more than basic features as "gimmicks". JohnyNoLegs Completely agree. For some reason, there has always been a market for this. Feels to me it's for people who either don't do that much on their phone, or like buying third party apps for some reason. Tom Harman While I like my pixel, I'll stick to my D800e for 99% of my photos. madcanada Lol, I have a Canon 6D and I stick to Nexus 6P for 99% of my photos :D Patrick Comparing a 6D and a D800e is like comparing a Polaroid to a Leica. They're different tools for much different uses. That being said, I'm surprised that the Pixel wouldn't take over for the d800e... The simplicity, man! I don't shoot my d800 for anything but photo shoots now because the Pixel is too easy to get great shots and I don't have to spend hours in post. catalysto In the context of comparing to a smartphone, they are practically the same. Trent It's impressive, of course. But to suggest that even the best software will help a Pixel rival a DSLR is comedic. Good enough for most, they are, but put them up on a big screen next to similar shots from even a Nikon D3300 and the lack of pixels (amongst other things) will show which is better. There's also the small matter of all that editing hassle. Naturally, I shoot RAW with my DSLR, but a little time in Lightroom is generally all that's needed to make a shot pop. I appreciate that I'm being a little over-the-top in my condemnation, image quality/rivaling "real" cameras is about more than just how good something looks on a smartphone display. It's about being able to zoom in without a major loss of quality and casting the image to a TV and it not looking bad at that size. I do like my Pixel very much and it's great for casual shots. A DSLR replacement it is not, however. David Ruddock I think this is mostly about the power of light-gathering and composite HDR even when in use even with a tiny sensor. It bodes well for the future of algorithmic photography if nothing else - as sensors get better and algorithms do, too, we can keep pushing the limits of these already impressive methods. This example just takes it to an extreme as a showcase. madcanada This article is about the algorithm. You can apply the same process to a DSLR image making night sky shots even better. OhYeah! This is basicly only due to the Photo stacking technique. You can tell from the single image that each photo is pretty terrible but once you median stack the photos it can average out all the noise. You could create a photo that looked pretty great from a Galaxy S 3 if you really wanted to. madcanada Yes, that's what I said. OhYeah! Yep you kind of did in a different way. Good job, you can recognize similarities! TechGuy22 yet no one can buy the pixel thank god i was able to sell my 6p for 500 bucks and bought the xl rjyanj "no one can buy the pixel" "i bought the xl" hmm. TechGuy22 https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel_phone?hl=en-US can you buy it there ? that's what i meant dumb ass. i have an XL too. didn't buy it from google. nxtiak XL: Black 32gb and 128gb ships May 4th. Silver 32gb, available now, 128gb 3-4weeks. So Yes? Non XL are all out of stock. Shawn Spring I did the same, dumped the 6P after I had preordered the Pixel XL on launch day. Boy am I glad I did. Stevie_Wonder Shooting RAW (DNG) and manual exposure. Google just told us what we are missing from the Google Camera app. Thank you Google, but we knew that already. Mihai Ionescu What Manual camera app do you reccomend? WittyPixel a post that I made a while back in the 6p XDA forums, enjoy! https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-6p/themes-apps/nexus-6p-manual-camera-recommendations-t3340090 Lizzie McVeigh Adobe's Light Room Camera. You get full control of settings... up to 0.7" of exposure. Random! We desperately need that app you've mentioned, with manual controls for exposure time, aperture and ISO. Scott Olsen There's plenty of them already. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.flavionet.android.camera.pro Mike Or just get any phone that isn't developed by Google. My name is…. the smart choice martesque Like say, the LG V20 camera app. Defenestratus Took this picture on my old Nexus 6P of my neighbor's house the other day while walking the pooch. Moon was right behind the light house. the picture is pretty grainy but still pretty impressive given how dark it was outside (even though it doesn't look like it in the picture, I think Google Photos messed with the settings a bit) https://goo.gl/photos/1VBuUKxRGC7Dutyh7 Rod URL not found Ahamid17 Its a shame I had to give up my 5X for an iPhone because of that boot loop issue other than that I really loved my 5X camera Ahamid17 I would love to see the process in which he combined that 64 and 32 frames to get that result and imagine in the future if your camera app could do that in app instead of doing it on photoshop Tauran This needs to be an automated processing trick on Google photos. HDR is great but people like me don't have time to process photos manually to look this great. WittyPixel Salty post... "This is a composite of 32 frames at 4-second exposure and ISO 1600, taken with the Nexus 6P" realizing google didn't unlock all the capabilities he builds an apps to do so. If google allowed apps to use the sensor to it's full capability then we could do the same and the camera would be truly amazing. Gjorgi Lazarovski I don't get what you're saying but the Camera2 API that's in Android since Lollipop allows this and is fully enabled on both phones. You just need the right app, like Manual Camera from the Play store for example. With a tripod and set of skills in Photoshop you're most likely to get the same results by yourself. Kyle Gospodnetich The Pixel and 6P camera drivers are limited to 2 second exposures max. There are many other phones from other manufacturers that can have much, much longer exposure times set via the Camera2 API. funky There is also a hack on xda to support longer exposures, I guess 4 sec WittyPixel future reference... link or it doesn't exist. and there is not one for the nexus 6p, fyi. WittyPixel camera 2 API does not allow that feature. bobinchicago Hey, my Nexus 6P would take great shots too if the battery life wasn't down to an hour and plunging down to 0 the moment I open the camera app. VAVAMk_2 Get a replacement battery dblock I honestly think even the 6P has a better camera than the S8+. I have only had the phone less than a week, but thus far it seems like the camera just isn't as good, back or front camera for that matter. And it may not be the sensors themselves, but perhaps the software. The Google Camera on the Nexus/Pixel devices is just too damn good. JohnyNoLegs Blind tests put the S8 on almost equal footing of the Pixel. It's all in the software. Hence why it takes so long to process images after you take them. Klugschwaetzer Mhh. I'm wondering why I see no star trails after 2 minutes. Stars should not be round, but elongated. Since they are quite round, it seems that this Mr. Kainz has adjusted for earth's motion somehow. But then the branches of the trees should be blurry. Very strange indeed. ChicagoPete I hope you've taken the last 12 minutes to read the source post for this article. Klugschwaetzer I have. Have you? 64 images with two second exposure each means that not counting an intervall between shots you look at the sky for over 128 seconds. The stars will have moved by that time making a virtual overexposure very difficult. Unless he somehow compensated for that. But I don't see how he could have done that - as I said before. Klugschwaetzer Just read the source article. Thanks for pointing that out. jwildman16 Two seconds, not minutes. NinoBr0wn I've given up hope for Google to update their camera app to something above a passing grade. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good strategy by Google to do night pictures. That minimizes the chance of getting halos in the Pixel pictures. whispy_snippet Haven't you already been completely burnt in a camera debate that forced you to leave the discussion without a reply? Why would you want to do it again? Mix I was like how in the heck can I do this with my Pixel!? ".....he built a simple camera app with manual control over exposure time" Dammit.

(Image: Reuters) Google has sprinkled some new ingredients into its search engine in an effort to prevent bogus information and offensive suggestions from souring its results. Read more: Flipkart Apple Days: iPhone 6 for Rs 25,999, iPhone 7 for Rs 47,999 and More The changes have been in the works for four months, but Google hadn't publicly discussed most of them until now. The announcement in a blog post Tuesday reflects Google's confidence in a new screening system designed to reduce the chances that its influential search engine will highlight untrue stories about people and events, a phenomenon commonly referred to as "fake news." sponsored Moto G5 (3 GB, Lunar... ₹ 11,999.00 Moto G5 (3 GB, Fine... ₹ 11,999.00 Moto G Play, 4th Gen... ₹ 8,999.00 "It's not a problem that is going to go all the way to zero, but we now think we can stay a step ahead of things," said Ben Gomes, Google's vice president of engineering for search. Read more: BSNL Unveils Cheap Data Plan, Offers 270GB Data for Rs 333 CORRECTING AUTOCOMPLETE Besides taking steps to block fake news from appearing in its search results, Google also has reprogrammed a popular feature that automatically tries to predict what a person is looking for as a search request as being typed. The tool, called "autocomplete," has been overhauled to omit derogatory suggestions, such as "are women evil," or recommendations that promote violence. Google also adding a feedback option that will enable users to complain about objectionable autocomplete suggestions so a human can review the wording. Facebook, where fake news stories and other hoaxes have widely circulated on its social network, also has been trying to stem the tide of misleading information by working with The Associated Press and other news organisations to review suspect stories and set the record straight when warranted. Facebook also has provided its nearly 2 billion users ways to identify posts believed to contain false information, something that Google is now allowing users of its search engine to do for some of the news snippets featured in its results. WHY GOOGLE CARES Google began attacking fake news in late December after several embarrassing examples of misleading information appeared near the top of its search engine. Among other things, Google's search engine pointed to a website that incorrectly reported then President-elect Donald Trump had won the popular vote in the US election , that President Barack Obama was planning a coup and that the Holocaust never occurred during World War II. Watch video Only about 0.25 percent of Google's search results were being polluted with falsehoods, Gomes said. But that was still enough to threaten the integrity of a search engine that processes billions of search requests per day largely because it is widely regarded as the internet's most authoritative source of information. "They have a lot riding on this, reputation wise," said Lucy Dalglish, who has been tracking the flow of false information as dean of the University of Maryland's journalism department. "If your whole business model is based turning up the best search results, but those results turn up stuff that is total crap, where does that get you?" To address the problem, Google began revising the closely guarded algorithms that generate its search with the help of 10,000 people who rate the quality and reliability of the recommendations during tests. Google also rewrote its 140-page book of rating guidelines that help the quality-control evaluators make their assessments. GOOGLE AS REFEREE Fighting fake news can be tricky because in some cases what is viewed as being blatantly misleading by one person might be interpreted as being mostly true by another. If Google, Facebook or other companies trying to block false information err in their judgment calls, they risk being accused of censorship or playing favourites. But doing nothing to combat fake news would probably have caused even bigger headaches. If too much misleading information appears in Google's search results, the damage could go beyond harm to its reputation for reliability. It could also spook risk-averse advertisers, who don't want their brands tied to content that can't be trusted, said Larry Chiagouris, a marketing professor at Pace University in New York. "Fake news is careening out of control in some people's eyes, so advertisers are getting very skittish about it," Chiagouris said. "Anything Google can do to show it is trying to put a lid on it and prevent it from getting out of hand, it will be seen as a good thing." Although it also sells ads on its other services and independently owned websites, Google still makes most of its money from the marketing links posted alongside its search results. Google says its new approach isn't meant to placate advertisers.

By Rachel Middleton Updated April 26, 2017 04:00 BST Google marks the grand finale journey of the Cassini.Google doodle The latest Google Doodle features the Cassini spacecraft in marking the start of a series of swoops the vessel will make between the planet Saturn and its rings prior to its destruction. The spacecraft will be making these cosmic acrobatics as part of its last journey that will offer an unprecedented look at the second largest planet in the solar system. This will include 22 deep dives between Saturn's cloud tops and innermost ring before it plunges into the planet's atmosphere. Google says the last leg of its journey will help scientists learn more about the origins, mass, and age of Saturn's rings, as well as the mysteries of the gas giant's interior. "And of course there will be breathtaking additions to Cassini's already stunning photo gallery," the tech giant added. "Who knows what marvels this hardy explorer will uncover in the final chapter of its mission?" Cassini started its 2.2 billion-mile track in space 20 years ago and has been "hanging out" with Saturn since 2004. The spacecraft is a joint-endeavour of NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Italian Space Agency (ASI). It was the first spacecraft to orbit Saturn, offering the first in-depth, up-close study of the planet and its system of rings and moons in 2004. Linda Spilker, Cassini's project scientist, said: "We're looking at a string of remarkable discoveries ... about Saturn's magnificent rings, its amazing moons, its dynamic magnetosphere and Titan's surface and atmosphere. California Institute of Technology quotes Spilker as saying: "Some of the mission highlights so far include discovering that Titan has Earth-like processes and that the small moon Enceladus has a hot-spot at its southern pole, plus jets on the surface that spew out ice crystals, and liquid water beneath its surface." The Cassini spacecraft will end its mission this year.NASA Titan is Saturn's largest moon. Cassini's observations of Titan has given scientists on Earth, a look at what Earth might have been like before life evolved, the Institute said, adding that it is now believed that Titan has several parallels to Earth, including lakes, rivers, channels, dunes, rain clouds, mountains and even possibly volcanoes. This will be Cassini's final journey, before, perhaps fittingly, decommissioning itself by crashing through Saturn's atmosphere. The spacecraft was initially targeted for only a four-year tour of the Saturn system which was completed in 2008. It has gone through two mission extensions. The two-year Cassini Equinox Mission saw the spacecraft make 60 additional orbits of the planet, 26 flybys of Titan, seven of Enceladus and one each of Dione, Rhea and Helene. In 2010, it carried out its second, seven-year-long escapade: The Cassini Solstice Mission. NASA offers its grand finale toolkit that will allow viewers to take the journey with Cassini.

Kiwi for Gmail will appeal to those Google aficionados who are currently accessing Google services – primarily Gmail (including mail, calendar and contacts), but also Google’s G-Suite office apps – through their web browser. Kiwi for Gmail provides users with a desktop client for accessing a single Gmail account at no cost. The program also includes a Premium subscription (currently $9.99 a year) that lets users connect up to six accounts within the same program (all colour-coded and via separate tabs), along with separate windows for G-Suite apps (Docs, Sheets and Slides) and Google Drive. The app doesn’t attempt to reinvent the wheel – users will instantly recognise a similar user interface to that found in their web browser. That said, the app does have some handy tricks up its sleeve, most notably the ability to compose new messages in a separate window. Users also gain the ability to access calendar and contacts in separate windows too, using the shortcut icons down the left-hand side of the app. Kiwi for Gmail installs as a 30-day trial of the Premium version, at the end of which the app reverts to Kiwi for Gmail Lite, which works solely with Gmail (mail, contacts and calendar), and is limited to a single Google account. The Premium version, which costs $9.99 a year for Windows users, allows users to connect up to six Google accounts within the app, and also integrates Google Drive and the G-Suite family of apps: Docs, Sheets and Slides. Again, apps run in their own windows, providing users with something closer to Microsoft Office in look and feel. Desktop shortcuts for all three apps are also created during installation, allowing users to pin these elsewhere for convenient access. Other key features found in the Premium version include global keyboard shortcuts for composing mail without leaving the current app. Two features exclusive (for now) to this new Windows release are the ability to configure “important-only” notifications, plus a “Zen Switch”. This is the equivalent of your mobile’s Do Not Disturb feature that disables all notifications – just click the crescent moon icon in the left-hand bar to switch it on and off. Kiwi for Gmail 2.0 is available now as a free 30-day trial for PCs running Windows 7 or later. After the 30-day trial expires, the program reverts to Kiwi for Gmail Lite. A Premium subscription costs $9.99 per year. Mac versions of both – including Kiwi for Gmail Lite – are available through the Mac App Store. Note Mac users can purchase the Premium version for a one-off cost of $9.99.

AUSTIN (KXAN) — Google announced last week that its virtual assistant can now recognize voices. That means your family — up to 6 people — can use Google Home and the device will be able to tell who’s talking. But a semi-silly ad released by Burger King a week before the Google announcement has raised questions about exactly how long they’ve been able to tell your voice from someone else’s. Burger King’s ad deliberately triggered Google Home devices to tell people about the Whopper — and it worked — until it didn’t. Hours after the commercial rolled out, the Google assistant stopped responding to the actor’s voice, but it would still respond if someone else asked the exact same question. The change suggests Google may have been able to recognize the actor’s voice and block the device from responding. It wasn’t until a week later that Google announced the voice recognition function. I asked a Google spokesperson how long they’ve been able to differentiate voices. The email response was emphatic. “We just announced the Assistant can recognize up to six voices on Google Home yesterday [last Thursday], [the function] rolled out at the same time.” Tech analyst Patrick Moorhead from Austin-based Moor Insights theorizes Google may have been able to recognize voices from the beginning but wanted to make sure it worked before going public with it. “Because they came in after Amazon and they wanted to get the good reviews and Amazon wasn’t doing multi-user… they wanted to make sure it worked before they announced it,” says Moorhead. Devices like Google Home and Amazon Echo have raised concerns about privacy. We’ve been giving companies our personal information for decades, but something about a device that can listen to you in your home seems to have struck a nerve with some people. A KXAN investigation in March tested the devices and found they appear to work how Amazon and Google say they do. And because those companies make money by knowing as much about you as they can, Dr. Philp Doty, associate dean of the School of Information at the University of Texas, questioned whether they might quietly become more aggressive in the future. “Even if they were the best of good actors, it would be difficult to resist the temptation to gather more and more information about us,” Doty said.

The Hawaii Independent Contact About Masthead Blog Login Create Account Post Collection /div> Discussion Google Announced The Integration of Android Pay with Mobile Banking Apps Calix Steve April 25, 2017 05:52 AM Google announces that now onwards, for mobile payments, its users do not need to use its official app, Android Pay. This technology giant has made possible to integrate this feature with mobile banking apps helpful for users to make payment just by a tap of a button. At present, Google has partnered with a few banks only including Bank of America, Discover, Bank of New Zealand, USAA, and mBank. It is striving to facilitate more number of users’ benefits this technology by integrating more numbers of banks in the near future. It has added Android pay feature in their app. It allows users to add their debit and credit cards to Android Pay and can use the option whenever they require. With this latest built-in capability, it enables to persuade people to maximize use of Android Pay and make it reachable to everybody. As the banking app is different for each bank, the integration also varies somewhat, but the key focus is simplifying to add cards to Android pay using the banking app itself. It attracts more users to utilize Android Pay once they found it in their bank apps. In order to battle its major rival Apple, this becomes a key focus for Google to stay ahead in competition.

After all, they are the vehicle on which these misleading content ride on to get to our web browsers. Google has definitely felt the pressure in these past months from fake news as well as inappropriate search results. Although it did take some time, Google is now making public the big changes it is making to its Search system to ensure that questionable content don’t get through. At least not much. If you think about it, Google can actually be blamed for much of this mess. Although it has existed long before Google burst onto the scene, the SEO (Search Engine Optimization) industry boomed in no small part thanks to Google’s PageRank system. That, however, also led to people and methods that tried to game that system, the same methods used by sites to bypass Google’s automated screening to spread deceptive, offensive, or inaccurate content. Amusingly, Google is combating fake news and inappropriate content by employing the assistance of humans. Much of Google’s search features rely on algorithms and machine learning but, as history has proven, those aren’t exactly infallible. Google has a team of human evaluators that rate the quality and accuracy of search results in general. These evaluators don’t affect page ranks of individual pages but simply flag search results as they see fit. In addition, Google is now also seeking your help as well. That is, it has added ways for users to give feedback and report inappropriate search results. This does require that users care enough about improving Google Search for everyone or have been offended strongly enough to take action. Of course, these feedback mechanisms are two-edged swords. Less scrupulous humans could use such to skew results away from appropriate or accurate results. In the end, the user is the final filter that determines whether a piece of content is trustworthy or appropriate. Unfortunately, as we’ve all too painfully seen, that isn’t the case.

Linaro Ltd, the open source collaborative engineering organization developing software for the ARM® ecosystem, today announced the availability of the HiKey 960 96Boards development platform from Linaro Core member Huawei. Designed to provide access to the latest ARM mobile technology for AOSP developers, this new board is now listed on the 96Boards website and will become available through global distribution channels. While all AOSP developers will find the board useful, it is developers who want to work closer to the hardware who will gain maximum advantage from it. This will include mobile developers looking to enable support and innovative functionality with new and existing sensors, security and other peripheral hardware and software, and developers working on derivative products for markets like digital signage, point of sale (POS), robotics and others outside the traditional mobile AOSP space. We are very pleased to be working with Linaro members ARM, Huawei, Google, Archermind and LeMaker on this product, said George Grey, Linaro CEO. The HiKey 960 delivers on the goal of 96Boards to provide access to the latest ARM technology to the developer community, with support for the latest Huawei mobile SoC featuring high performance ARM Cortex®-A73 cores coupled with the latest generation of ARM Mali GPU technology. The new board is based around the Huawei Kirin 960 octa-core ARM big.LITTLE processor with four ARM Cortex-A73 and four Cortex-A53 cores with 3GB of LPDDR4 SDRAM memory, 32GB of UFS 2.1 flash storage, and the latest generation Mali-G71 MP8 graphics processor. Available now through Archermind (Alpha-Star) and LeMaker (Lenovator), the HiKey 960 96Boards development platform is on sale at US$239 and is expected to be available through local distribution in the US, EU and Japan in early May. We are very pleased to bring our highest performance mobile SoC to the 96Boards program and to be working with Google and Linaro in the AOSP project, said Benjamin Wang, Deputy General Manager of Huawei Wireless Terminal Chipset Business Unit, We expect that developers will be excited to get access to the latest ARM CPU and GPU technology, as well as new features such as a PCIe M.2 card interface for additional high performance storage or wireless cards, all running using the latest AOSP builds. Google develops Android to run on multiple architectures and the Linaro engagement is in particular aimed at collaboration with ARM-based system-on-chip (SoC) partners. Android Open Source Project (AOSP) has been a key part of Linaros work since its founding in 2010, and Linaros AOSP contributions have now spanned 24 kernel versions from Linux kernel 2.6.36 in Android Honeycomb (3.0) to Linux 4.10 today. The HiKey 960 will be the second HiKey officially supported as an Android reference board and it will bring new levels of performance to Android developers. ARM is committed to providing platform developers with access to new technologies in an effort to support ongoing innovation on ARM-based mobile platforms, said Laurence Bryant, vice president of personal mobile compute, Business Segments Group, ARM. The HiKey 960 platform integrates the latest big.LITTLE technology that combines the Cortex-A73, the most powerful yet power efficient mobile CPU, the Cortex-A53 for further efficiency and the latest Mali GPU, Mali-G71. Running on the latest AOSP builds, were enabling a range of advanced solutions to be brought to market more quickly. Initial software support for the board is provided in the AOSP source tree based on the Android Common Kernel using the Linux 4.4 kernel release. Linaro and Huawei are also working on the Linux 4.9 based Android Common kernel and maintaining support for the Kirin 960 SoC in the mainline kernel.org tree, allowing for the availability of multiple Linux distributions for this board in the future. Information about the HiKey 960 board and running Android on it will be available here: http://source.android.com/source/devices.html. Linaro is providing instructions for developers here: http://linaro.co/hikey960-start.   HiKey 960 board specifications SoC: Kirin 960 octa-core CPU with 4x Cortex-A73 cores to 2.4 GHz, 4x Cortex-A53 cores to 1.8 GHz and Mali-G71 MP8 GPU Software: AOSP with 4.4 AOSP common kernel Storage: 32GB UFS 2.1 flash storage and microSD card slot  Video Output / Display Interface: HDMI 1.2a up to 1080p plus 4-lane MIPI DSI  Connectivity: Dual-band 802.11 b/g/n/ac WiFi and Bluetooth 4.1 with on board antennas  USB: 2 x USB 3.0 type A host ports, 1 x USB 2.0 type C OTG port  Camera: 1x 4-lane MIPI CSI, 1x 2-lane MIPI CSI  Expansion: PCIe Gen2 on M.2 Key connector; 40-pin low speed expansion connector +1.8V, +5V, DC power, GND, 2x UART, 2x I2C, SPI, I2S, 12x GPIO; 60-pin high speed expansion connector 4L MIPI DSI, 2L+4L MIPI CSI, 2x I2C, SPI (48M), USB 2.0  Misc: LEDs for WiFi & Bluetooth, 4x user LEDs, power button  Power Supply: 8V-18V/2A via 4.75/1.7mm power barrel (EIAJ-3 Compliant),12V/2A power supply recommended Dimensions: 85mm x 55mm  About Linaro Linaro is leading collaboration on open source development in the ARM ecosystem.

Mark Hachman (PC World (US online)) 26 April, 2017 04:34 - - - - print email Comments Google might not be as responsible for the spread of fake news as social media, but the search giant is still doing something about it: burying known sources of fake news, and letting users weigh in, too. Google frequently tweaks the algorithms that return relevant search results, sometimes privately, and other times publicly. In this case, Google announced Tuesday that about 0.25 percent of all daily search results have been returning “offensive or clearly misleading content,” and those results will be pushed lower in search results in favor of more authoritative results. Google is also implementing Feedback links for users to report on the accuracy of autocomplete search queries and Featured Snippet text. Deliberately misleading information, as well as outright fabrications, plagued the 2016 U.S. presidential primary season and election. Numerous sources found that sites purporting to be legitimate news services were simply making up “news” stories for profit, or as propaganda, and sharing them on social media sites like Facebook. Politicians on both sides used “fake news” as a rallying cry, and studies, such as this one from Stanford University, found that students were increasingly unable to tell the difference between a legitimate news story and a fabricated one. The problem, according to Google, is that 15 percent of all daily searches are brand new. Google can easily know the answer to a query like “Is the earth flat?” But if it’s a query the search engine hasn’t seen before, it has fewer sources of context to rely on. Google What Google’s feedback will look like for autosuggested searches. Why this matters: Google’s efforts should be applauded, but it’s unclear what difference this will make in the long run. The problem isn’t so much that users are searching for fake news; it’s that they’re being force-fed a steady diet of propaganda from friends, contacts, and fake-news sites they’ve already bought into. Facebook tried to solve the problem last fall by implementing a verification mechanisms to combat fake news, but it’s not clear that it’s working. Letting users help decide what’s fake, offensive Last fall, Google announced plans to attach a “Fact Check” label to search results, which it began rolling out in April. Fact Check attempts to adjudicate whether the information in question is truly accurate, using sources like Snopes.com. Still, Fact Check was a response to users who were already searching for a given news report or “fact." Google’s latest tweak makes erroneous results harder to find. “We’ve adjusted our signals to help surface more authoritative pages and demote low-quality content, so that issues similar to the Holocaust denial results that we saw back in December are less likely to appear,” Ben Gomes, Google’s vice president of engineering for search, wrote. Google Feedback for Featured Snippets lets users identify possible fake news. That effort will be assisted by what Google calls Search Quality Raters, real people who assess the quality of Google’s search results. While those people don’t affect search results in real time, they do provide feedback on whether the changes to the algorithms are working, Gomes wrote. More direct input from users themselves will come via new Feedback links attached to autocompleted searches and Featured Snippets. These links are tiny, a gray bit of text at the bottom of the autocomplete bar or the snippet itself. Clicking them, however, allows users to provide direct feedback. In the example Google provided, users can mark checkboxes to state whether a suggested search was hateful or sexually explicit. (Google doesn’t allow autocompleted queries to be marked as inaccurate, since they’re presumably questions.) Google’s Featured Snippets evolved as quick synopses of the answers users were searching for, such as when the Leaning Tower of Piza was built. Now users can assess the snippet with anything from “I don’t like this” to “This is harmful, dangerous, or violent” to “This is misleading or inaccurate.” It’s not clear what happens when an autocompleted search or snippet is marked as inaccurate or inoffensive, however. (We’ve reached out to Google, but representatives didn’t immediately respond.) Will Google’s algorithms take over, or will an actual human make the call? Reporting real information as fake could have negative effects, too. As we’ve learned over the past months, “fake news” is often in the eye of the beholder. ​CIO Executive Council member profile: Emmanuel Steve Dulvin More from CIO Executive Council Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

Michael Kan (IDG News Service) 26 April, 2017 10:54 - - - - print email Comments The Russian hacking group blamed for targeting U.S. and European elections has been breaking into email accounts, not only by tricking victims into giving up passwords, but by stealing access tokens too.  It's sneaky hack that's particularly worrisome, because it can circumvent Google's 2-step verification, according to security firm Trend Micro.  The group, known as Fancy Bear or Pawn Storm, has been carrying out the attack with its favored tactic of sending out phishing emails, Trend Micro said in a report Tuesday.  The attack works by sending out a fake email, pretending to be from Google, with the title “Your account is in danger.” Trend Micro An example of a phishing email that Fancy Bear has used.  The email claims that Google detected several unexpected sign-in attempts into their account. It then suggests users install a security application called “Google Defender.” However, the application is actually a ruse. In reality, the hacking group is trying to dupe users into giving up a special access token for their Google account, Trend Micro said. Victims that fall for the scheme will be redirected to an actual Google page, which can authorize the hacking group's app to view and manage their email. Users that click “allow” will be handing over what’s known as an OAuth token. Although the OAuth protocol doesn't transfer over any password information, it's designed to grant third-party applications access to internet accounts through the use of special tokens.  The OAuth protocol may have been designed for convenience, but security experts have warned it can be used for malicious effect. In the case of Fancy Bear, the hacking group has leveraged the protocol to build fake applications that can fool victims into handing over account access, Trend Micro said.   “After abusing the screening process for OAuth approvals, (the group’s) rogue application operates like every other app accepted by the service provider,” the security firm said. Even Google's 2-step verification, which is designed to prevent unwarranted account access, can't stop the hack, according to Trend Micro. Google's 2-step verification works by requiring not only a password, but also a special code sent to a user's smartphone when logging in. Security experts say it's an effective way to protect your account. However, the phishing scheme from Fancy Bear manages to sidestep this security measure, by tricking users into granting access through the fake Google security app. "The target might be familiar with generic phishing emails, but not so much with OAuth abuse tricks," Trend Micro said in its report. "Chances are significant that even well-educated targets get fooled." Google, however, said it takes many steps to protect users from such phishing attacks. "In addition, Google detects and reviews potential OAuth abuse and takes down thousands of apps for violating our User Data Policy, such as impersonating a Google app," the company said in a statement. "Note that a real Google app should be directly accessed from a Google site or installed from the Google Play or Apple App stores," it added. According to Trend Micro, victims were targeted with this phishing attack in 2015, and 2016. In addition to Google Defender, Fancy Bear has used other apps under names such as Google Email Protection and Google Scanner. They’ve also gone after Yahoo users with apps called Delivery Service and McAfee Email protection. Trend Micro The attack attempts to trick users into handing over access to their email through fake Google third-party applications.  “Internet users are urged to never accept OAuth token requests from an unknown party or a service they did not ask for,” Trend Micro said. Although a password reset can sometimes revoke an OAuth token, it's best to check what third-party applications are connected to your email account. This can be done by looking at an email account's security settings, and revoking access where necessary.  Fancy Bear is most notorious for its suspected role in hacking the Democratic National Committee last year. However, the group has also been found targeting everything from government ministries, media organizations, along with universities and think tanks, according to Trend Micro.

These are our favorite iPhone apps to be productive on the iPhone, have fun, lose weight, relax and entertain ourselves. You can use these on the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus as well as older iPhones. Our favorite iPhone apps are a mix of free and paid apps, and anything on this list is an app that we would buy a second time if we had to. Whether you are new to the iPhone, upgrading from an ancient iPhone or just looking for the best new iPhone apps to install — this list has something for you. Best iPhone Apps Here are the best iPhone apps to download in 2017. These best iPhone apps work on any device that runs iOS 10, and many will also work on iOS 9. If you have the iPhone 4 or the iPhone 7, there are great iPhone apps on this list for you to use. Most of these apps are optimized for the bigger screens of the iPhone 6, iPhone 6s, Phone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s, iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus — but they will work fine on smaller screens like the iPhone SE or iPhone 4s too. Best iPhone Photography Apps Best iPhone Games Best iPhone Entertainment Apps Best Business iPhone Apps Best iPhone Shopping Apps Best iPhone Health Apps Best iPhone Social Media Apps Best iPhone Travel Apps Best iPhone Budget Apps Best iPhone Apps to Save Money Best iPhone Fitness Apps Best iPhone Weight Loss Apps Best iPhone Apps to Make Money Best iPhone Alarm Clock Apps Best iPhone Racing Games for iPhone Best iPhone Diabetes Apps Best Math Apps Some of these include 3D Touch support for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus that allows users to use added functions with a harder press on the screen. These apps can connect you to other people, control your home, entertain you with games, music, and audiobooks and help you be more productive with the time you have. The Best iPhone Apps Here are the iPhone apps that I use the most. These are the iPhone apps that I keep on my home screen and the dock. Although this list doesn’t break down into nice categories, here is a look at the most useful iPhone apps I own. I’ll leave the default Apple apps off this list, but there are many on my home screen that I cannot live without. Google Maps – Hands down a better way to get from one place to the next or to search for places than Apple Maps. It has yet to tell me to drive off a non-existent bridge. I cannot say the same about Apple Maps. Huntington – Even with text notifications it is important for me to have access to my banking app on the home screen, and the ability to remotely deposit checks with the iPhone. SoundCloud – A great way to check out sets from music festivals and hard to find tracks from DJs and artists before they are on other services. Spotify – The best way to listen to music on the iPhone. Spotify is more evolved than Apple Music and it is a bargain at $9.99 a month. Audible – I listen to an incredible number of Audiobooks and Audible is the best place to buy them. With a subscription I save on audiobooks each month. Dark Sky – Great, hyper local forecasts and push notifications that tell me when it is going to rain or snow. Alien Blue – This is still the best iPhone Reddit app I’ve found, but I am looking for a replacement. Slack – If you work on a team or in a small office forget the hassles of email for internal communication and switch to Slack. You’ll love it. Asana – This is a to do list app and service that works great for teams, but you can also use it for your own tasks and projects. MyFitnessPal – MyFitnessPal is one of the best weight loss iPhone apps and it was the key to helping me lose 25 pounds this year. After a break I am back in the app to keep the weight off. Nest – The Nest app connects to my Nest thermostat to let me control the temperature of my house from bed or from a hundred miles away. This saves me energy and it’s an awesome convenience app. Harmony – I use the Harmony app along with the Logitech Harmony Ultimate Home remote and hub to control my home entertainment and lights. I can tap on Play Xbox One and the Tv, Xbox, soundbar and lights all turn to the right settings. I can also control my TV volume and channels with the iPhone. Hue – I control and customize five Hue lights with this app. I will be upgrading soon to use Siri to control the lights. Lutron Caséta – The Lutron Caséta app lets me use Siri and the app to turn lamps on and off at home using the Caséta Wireless switches and to control my Kitchen Lights after I replaced the switches. No need to upgrade bulbs for a smart home experience. MyQ – This app lets me open and close my Chamberlain WiFi garage door with my iPhone. I get push notifications, although on iOS 9 they sometimes double up, to let me know someone opened the door. HDE OTP – I use this app instead of Google Authenticator to track the many One Time Passwords I need to use as Two-Factor Authentication for several websites. Hangouts – Google Hangouts is an essential tool for communicating with friends, co-workers and family. LastPass – I only need to remember one password and I can use my long list of complicated passwords. Touch ID allows me to reach them with the touch of a finger instead of typing my password out. Read my LastPass review. Tweetbot 4 – The newest version of Tweetbot is an amazing way to connect to Twitter. It handles all my needs for sending messages and the new Activity tab removes the need for me to use the default Twitter app to track follows and retweets. Gmail – The Gmail app is a great way for most users to check email on the iPhone and an essential app for many people on our team. Notion – Notion.ai is the best iPhone email app you can find. It delivers smart notifications, easy inbox management and even knows when someone asks you a question. You need to try this app out today. These three apps earn an honorable mention on my home screen list since I keep them with easy access on my second home screen so that I can always access them. Evernote – The new Notes app is my go to app, but Evernote still offers a great place to save and track notes. I used this to track all communication about lost luggage and to share the notebook with interested parties easily. Workflow – Workflow lets you automate activities and tasks on the iPhone 6s, and it supports 3D Touch quick actions to your favorites. I am just scratching the surface of what it can do and I am amazed. Kindle – The Kindle app is my go to app for reading. I love it because I can use it to start a book, read more later on my Kindle and also always have the freedom to jump to another platform. 1Password – If you aren’t a fan of LastPass, 1Password is an excellent option that helps you keep all of your passwords safe behind, you guessed it one password. Calm – When you need a break from your hectic life, the Calm app will help you relax and refresh using your iPhone, headphones and a chair. Ring – You’ll need the Ring doorbell to make use of this app, but once you install it you can see and talk to people who ring your doorbell, even if you are miles away. Best iPhone Photography Apps I use these iPhone photography apps to make my photos look better, connect to my camera and share photos and videos. I use iCloud Photo Library to back up my photos, but if you don’t you should check out Flickr or Google Photos. YouTube Capture – – Record videos quickly and upload to YouTube in a snap. Perfect for content creators. Camera+ – A handy app that can perform magical automatic fixes for photos that need better lighting with one touch. Instagram – Fun place to explore photos and share photos. 3D Touch makes browsing in the Explore mode easier than ever. PlayMemories Mobile – I use this app to connect to my Sony RX 100 III and transfer photos to the iPhone for editing and sharing. Pixelmator – My favorite desktop photo editor is now on iPhone allowing me to quickly fix up and edit photos. iMovie – I often shoot review videos on the iPhone 6s and I can use iMovie to edit the 4K video I shoot and then choose to upload in 4K or in 1080P. TouchReTouch – This app performs miracles when you need to restore an old photo that has cracks, creases and damage. Simply amazing. Darkroom – This is another photo editing app that I enjoy using on the iPhone 6s. One thing I like is that there are sliders on one screen to adjust multiple options so I can easily adjust one and then the next. Afterlight – Powerful photo editing tool with filters, lots of control and the option to tap to see the original and let go to see your current edits for easy before and after editing. Layout – A simple tool from Instagram to combine photos into a collage on the iPhone to share on Instagram or another service. Best iPhone Games Here are the best iPhone games that I enjoy playing. There are a lot of great iPhone games out there and we expect to see more games add 3D Touch for the iPhone 6s in the coming weeks and months. Monument Valley – A fun and challenging puzzle style game that tasks gamers with moving the environment around until you can get your character to the right door. Threes! – Slide tiles around to match up numbers. Starts off simple, but gets challenging quickly as your numbers climb higher. Alto’s Adventure – Jump and ski your way to the bottom of a never-ending mountain as you collect llamas, run from village elders and collect power ups. Agar.io – Control growing circle that expands as it absorbs smaller circles until you are the biggest blob on the board. Simple, but addicting. Siegefall – A strategy game similar to Clash of Clans, but with a less cartoonish look. This is my favorite of the tow games and worth trying out. Clash of Clans – We can’t list off the best apps without touching on Clash of Clans which many iPhone users are addicted to playing. If you like it, you probably love it. Shadowmatic – My latest addiction is a puzzle type game where you move objects around to create a shadow on the wall. It is a simple premise, but the difficulty increases as you progress. Does Not Commute – Guide cars around the city to get them to the destination without crossing and crashing with the traffic you already put into place with earlier cars. Madden Mobile – A small fix of Madden on the iPhone. It isn’t as good as Madden 16 on the Xbox One, but it is a fun way to pass some time. Smashy Road: Wanted – A fun time waster for driving around and escaping the police with simple graphics. Fallout Shelter – Manage resources and grow your shelter in this Fallout game that is a perfect fit for the iPhone screen size. Fun and frustrating at the same time as you balance inhabitants and resources. Super Sharp – This fun puzzle game is challenging, incredibly fun and frustrating. You cut parts of the level to hit targets and often need to set up several cuts to proceed. Best iPhone Entertainment Apps Here are the go to apps I use to watch video on the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. I don’t keep as many on here as I do on the iPad Air 2, but there are must have apps in this list. DirecTV – I can watch live TV on my iPhone using my DirecTV subscription. I don’t get all of my channels, but there are enough great options. WatchESPN – Finally I can use DirecTV to login to WatchESPN to see sports events and Sports Center on the go. NFL Mobile – With my Verizon iPhone 6s I can watch the Sunday Night, Monday Night and Thursday Night Football games live on the iPhone. Remote – The fastest way to control the Apple TV from the iPhone. Makes selection, searching and entering passwords very easy. Netflix – How else can I keep up on Narcos and binge watch too many TV shows on my iPhone for $8 a month? ESPN – I use this app to track teams, which lately simply lets me see how the Miami Dolphins are losing before my coworkers mention it. NFL Sunday Ticket – I am constantly busy on Sunday, no matter how I plan it, so I rely on NFL Sunday Ticket to watch the Miami Dolphins on my iPhone 6s. Xbox One SmartGlass – With this app I can connect to my Xbox to change the game I am playing, enter in text and see and respond to messages without leaving a game. Yahoo Fantasy  – You can use this app to track almost any thing you need to stay on top of your fantasy sports team. Hulu – If you don’t want to pay for cable, this is one of the easiest ways to keep up on the latest shows without buying a bunch of season passes in iTunes. HBO Go – Watch HBO on your iPhone using your cable login, or use HBO Now to watch with a subscription direct to HBO. Access new shows and the full library of HBO Shows, plus current movies. YouTube – The YouTube app is the fastest way to watch YouTube videos on your iPhone and a great way to subscribe to channels you like. Amazon Instant Video – Amazon Prime members can use this to watch free streaming video on the iPhone including movies and TV shows without an additional subscription. Best Business iPhone Apps I use these apps to keep on top of business needs from my iPhone, from tracking packages, checking invoices paid and other utilities. These iPhone apps help me get things done. UPS – With UPS My Choice and this app I can see when packages will come and even change delivery options if I need to. Fedex – With this app and registration with FedEx I can see all FedEx packages coming to my house from Ground and Express in one place. Even when I don’t have a tracking number. Speedtest – I often find myself testing the network connection and mobile connection before working or uploading a big file. With this app I can see if my current location supports what I need to do. Scanner Pro – Scanner Pro lets me quickly scan in a document without a scanner. The results are amazing and you would swear that it came from a full size scanner in an office. PayPal – Quickly send money, transfer money and make payments without the need to have cash on hand. Chrome – I don’t use Chrome as my main iPhone browser, but it is handy to have installed for use with the various Google apps I rely on and for checking the open tabs from Chrome on my Mac. Facebook Pages – I use this app to manage several Facebook pages. There is no real alternative, but it is still one of my must have apps. WordPress – If you work in WordPress this app can be a lifesaver when mobile. It does eat through battery life fast and it can crash, but it allows me to get work done with just an iPhone. Google – This is essentially the Google Now experience on the iPhone. It allows me to see important information and I use it for push notifications when orders I place ship and I get an email about it. Quicklytics – The best Google Analytics app for the iPhone. Real time view, overall stats, and access to filters that let me run more detailed reports from the iPhone. Expensify – An easy to use expensing app that captures receipts and cash transactions easily. I can then share an expense report in a few minutes from the web after the trip. Quickbooks – Although QuickBooks can be a pain to use in some instances, the app is a fast way to look at the most important information relating to my account. Parkmobile – No change, no problem. I use the Parkmobile app to pay for parking in many locations. I can even re-up parking without going back to my car if I am held over in a meeting. Sheets – My most used web app is Google Sheets. I use this app to reach important spreadsheets on the go. I don’t do a ton of work on them while mobile, but this makes it easier to reference. Pages – There are still times where I need to open a Pages document on my iPhone and I also use this to check the word count of items written in apps that don’t offer a word count tool. Dropbox – Still the most accessible and easy to use cloud storage client I’ve found. This is an easy way to get to my files and to upload files for access from anywhere. Paper by fifty three – This is a go to app for sketching and marking up images. It is easier to use on a bigger screen, but it is still handy to have on the iPhone 6s. Best iPhone Shopping Apps I use these iPhone shopping apps to save money on groceries and to simplify shopping from my iPhone for almost anything I need. I leave alerts on for GasBuddy since it will tell me if gas prices are going up in my area, but most of the other apps don’t get permission to push notifications. Amazon – The fastest way to order from Amazon. If you have Amazon Prime this is a must have app. Meijer – I use this app to clip coupons digitally that I use in the store to save significantly. If you use another grocer, like Kroger, check out this guide to digital grocery coupons. Square Register – When my wife works a craft show we use this app to accept credit cards from our phone. It works like a charm. Apple Store – The fastest place to order a new iPhone is also a handy place to look for iPhone 6s accessories and other Apple items. Best Buy – As a My Best Buy member I use this app to make purchases and to check my points balance as well as see if the local store has something I want in stock. Gas Buddy – Find the cheapest gas near you and get an alert when gas prices are set to go up so that you can fill up before the price changes. Starbucks – With the new mobile ordering option the Starbucks app isn’t just a great way to pay from Wallet. You can use this to place an order and skip the line at a busy Starbucks. Chipotle – An easy way to order from Chipotle so you can skip the line and get that Burrito goodness. OpenTable – This is the fastest way to get a reservation at a restaurant. Forget calling and checking multiple times over the phone and checking with your group. See what is open and then book it without making a call. Credit Karma – Use Credit Karma to get a free look at your credit score and you can get alerts when actions that impact your credit happen. Hobby Lobby – If you shop at Hobby Lobby you need to have this app installed so you can save 40% on one item each week. Best Health Apps RunKeeper – I’ve shifted a lot of my workouts to the Apple Watch’s built-in tracker, but when I want more detail, the Runkeeper app is a solid tool that can help you track your fitness goals. Fitnet – I just started testing Fitnet. The free iPhone app offers up short focused workouts based on your goals and includes an Apple Watch app and an Apple Watch complication that shows your progress. Activity – This app installs automatically once you connect an Apple Watch. It is an easy way to see how often I hit movement and workout goals. It can motivate or shame me into doing a better job. Sleep Cycle – This app uses your iPhone to monitor your sleep and then it will wake you up at the best time based on your sleep patterns. Best iPhone Apps for Social Media Facebook – I honestly go back and forth between uninstalling and installing the Facebook app because there are times I don’t want the distraction of Facebook in my hand. I always leave notifications off. Facebook Messenger – This app is the way that I keep in touch with many friends, and it is a must have on the iPhone 6s. Snapchat – I don’t snap a lot, but I enjoy using the fun new Snapchat Lenses to change the look with fun augmented reality filters. Untappd – This is a social network for beer lovers that can help you find new beers to try and enjoy. Best iPhone Travel Apps StubHub – When you need to find tickets for a concert or sporting event that is sold out, StubHub offers a trusted environment to find the tickets you want. TripIt – The best all in one travel organizer that tracks your hotel, flight, car rental and other activities simply by connecting your email to the app or forwarding a reservation. Flightaware – Always know where a flight is. This is the best way to track the flights that your loved ones or business associates are on. Hotel Tonight – Score last-minute reservations at amazing hotels at a bargain. You can book for tonight or up to seven days out. Grub Hub – An essential tool for ordering delivery from restaurants without making a phone call. Available in 800 cities and includes 30,000 restaurants. TripAdvisor – This is the fastest and easiest way to find things to do and check reviews of hotels and attractions on your iPhone. Waze – While I normally rely on Google Maps, Waze is a tool i use when traffic is an issue. It helped us avoid a huge traffic jam and get to an event with minutes to spare instead of waiting in traffic and missing out on an amazing experience. Yelp – Yelp is my go to tool for finding a new place to eat in a new city. We also use it to discover new stores when in a bigger city and on the hunt for something local. Glympse – This tool can help you tell people when you will get to a location. Just share a Glympse with them and they can see your current location and estimated time of arrival. 13 Responses 02/24/2016 Brittanylcarlson Reply 0=1my best friend’s half-sister makes $87 /hr on the laptop .

I came to iOS from Android recently, and I used BaconReader for Android, but I have to point out I was disappointed at their iOS version. I went to Reddit threads asking which iOS client was top-notch, or at least acceptable, and that’s how I found about narwhal. Not sure what you’re looking for in a client, but narwhal is a gesture driven app, and a decent fit to me. You should give it a try. 11/20/2016 Macondo Labs Reply New BvR game released by Macondo Software Labs is very simple, but challenging fight between Blue and Red teams.

		     Privacy Policy Thank you Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. By Michael Kan U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | Apr 25, 2017 5:54 PM PT Credit: Trend Micro More like this Trump administration is giving us a good lesson on Twitter security Sophisticated phishing attacks launched against Outlook Web App users 4 security suites that protect all your devices Video Why You Lost Your Windows 10 Product Key The Russian hacking group blamed for targeting U.S. and European elections has been breaking into email accounts, not only by tricking victims into giving up passwords, but by stealing access tokens too.  It's sneaky hack that's particularly worrisome, because it can circumvent Google's 2-step verification, according to security firm Trend Micro.  The group, known as Fancy Bear or Pawn Storm, has been carrying out the attack with its favored tactic of sending out phishing emails, Trend Micro said in a report Tuesday.  [ Further reading: How the new age of antivirus software will protect your PC ] The attack works by sending out a fake email, pretending to be from Google, with the title “Your account is in danger.” Trend Micro An example of a phishing email that Fancy Bear has used.  The email claims that Google detected several unexpected sign-in attempts into their account. It then suggests users install a security application called “Google Defender.” However, the application is actually a ruse. In reality, the hacking group is trying to dupe users into giving up a special access token for their Google account, Trend Micro said. Victims that fall for the scheme will be redirected to an actual Google page, which can authorize the hacking group's app to view and manage their email. Users that click “allow” will be handing over what’s known as an OAuth token. Although the OAuth protocol doesn't transfer over any password information, it's designed to grant third-party applications access to internet accounts through the use of special tokens.  The OAuth protocol may have been designed for convenience, but security experts have warned it can be used for malicious effect. In the case of Fancy Bear, the hacking group has leveraged the protocol to build fake applications that can fool victims into handing over account access, Trend Micro said.   “After abusing the screening process for OAuth approvals, (the group’s) rogue application operates like every other app accepted by the service provider,” the security firm said. Even Google's 2-step verification, which is designed to prevent unwarranted account access, can't stop the hack, according to Trend Micro. Google's 2-step verification works by requiring not only a password, but also a special code sent to a user's smartphone when logging in. Security experts say it's an effective way to protect your account. However, the phishing scheme from Fancy Bear manages to sidestep this security measure, by tricking users into granting access through the fake Google security app. "The target might be familiar with generic phishing emails, but not so much with OAuth abuse tricks," Trend Micro said in its report. "Chances are significant that even well-educated targets get fooled." Google, however, said it takes many steps to protect users from such phishing attacks. "In addition, Google detects and reviews potential OAuth abuse and takes down thousands of apps for violating our User Data Policy, such as impersonating a Google app," the company said in a statement. "Note that a real Google app should be directly accessed from a Google site or installed from the Google Play or Apple App stores," it added. According to Trend Micro, victims were targeted with this phishing attack in 2015, and 2016. In addition to Google Defender, Fancy Bear has used other apps under names such as Google Email Protection and Google Scanner. They’ve also gone after Yahoo users with apps called Delivery Service and McAfee Email protection. Trend Micro The attack attempts to trick users into handing over access to their email through fake Google third-party applications.  “Internet users are urged to never accept OAuth token requests from an unknown party or a service they did not ask for,” Trend Micro said. Although a password reset can sometimes revoke an OAuth token, it's best to check what third-party applications are connected to your email account. This can be done by looking at an email account's security settings, and revoking access where necessary.  Fancy Bear is most notorious for its suspected role in hacking the Democratic National Committee last year. However, the group has also been found targeting everything from government ministries, media organizations, along with universities and think tanks, according to Trend Micro.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Next-gen Pixel phones to run Snapdragon 835 processor By Rei Padla - April 25, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter The Google Pixel 2 is coming although we don’t know when exactly. Several hints and leaks already point to two new Pixel devices and maybe even a third phone. We know the pair is called ‘walleye’ and ‘muskie’ and that Google may also be ditching the headphone jack. The premium flagship devices will definitely have improved features but a cheaper variant may also be in the works. When it comes to specs, we heard that the tech giant would be investing heavily in LG Display for a curved Pixel 2. Now we’ve got information that the new Pixel line will be powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor. This is naturally expected because it is the most powerful from the brand today that is being used in several premium flagship models already like the Samsung Galaxy S8, Galaxy S8+, Sony XZ Premium, and the newly announced Xiaomi Mi 6. The Pixel ‘Walleye’ and ‘Muskie’ once again came up in the Google AOSP code together with ‘Taimen’. What is notable is that the three appeared with an MSM8998 CPU reference. The latter as we all know is the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC. Google has no reason to forego this chipset because it is the latest and it has already been tried and tested. It doesn’t need to follow LG who used the S821 instead of the S835 on the G6. Among the three, we know the Muskie will be the smaller. It could be the Pixel 2 while the Walleye could be the next-gen Pixel XL. The Taimen could just be a mini variant but might be loaded still with a fast processor. We’ll see. VIA: WinFuture Story Timeline Pixel 2 will have improved specs and features, might have a cheaper variant Google Pixel 2 definitely coming this year, still as a premium flagship device Google may be ditching headphone jack with Pixel 2 Google to invest heavily in LG Display for curved Pixel 2 Google unintentionally releases May 2017 security build for Pixel XL TAGS Android Google Pixel Smartphone Rei Padla Must Read Samsung Galaxy S8 Review Huawei Watch 2 hands-on Huawei Honor 8 Pro Review: things you need to know Stay Connected 883,798FansLike 135,847FollowersFollow 102,861FollowersFollow 475,768FollowersFollow 60,800SubscribersSubscribe About Contact Terms of Use Privacy Policy Advertise © 2008 - 2017 Android Community - Part of R3 Media LLC

Google isn't planning to rid fake news from its search results -- but it's trying to purge it from the top. The Alphabet Inc. company is making a rare, sweeping change to the algorithm behind its powerful search engine to demote misleading, false and offensive articles online. Google is also setting new rules encouraging its "raters" -- the 10,000-plus staff that assess search results -- to flag web pages that host hoaxes, conspiracy theories and what the company calls "low-quality" content. The moves follow months after criticism of Google and Facebook Inc. for hosting misleading information, particular tied to the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Google executives claimed the type of web pages categorized in this bucket are relatively small, which is a reason why the search giant hadn't addressed the issue before. "It was not a large fraction of queries -- only about a quarter percent of our traffic -- but they were important queries," said Ben Gomes, vice president of engineering for Google. Also Read: View - Time to break up Google? While Facebook has faced a backlash for the spread of fake news across its social network, Google has been criticized for results that leap to the top for specific queries. For example, last month for the search query, "is Obama planning a coup," the top result produced a blatantly wrong article, and did so in a feature snippet -- a text box that Google uses to give quick, authoritative answers. Gomes used this as an example of the type of search result the changes are meant to bury. "We were highlighting low-quality content in search results," he said. Additionally, Google is applying the same new parameters for its "auto-complete" function, which finishes search questions based on popularity. Some of the auto-completes that are deemed offensive (such as "are women evil") will be eliminated. Google is adding a feature to allow searchers online to flag these instances with a feedback form. Earlier this month, the company introduced a tool allowing publishers to fact-check articles in its search rankings. The newer changes apply to the secretive, core algorithm behind all Google search rankings. The alterations were devised in an internal group called "Project Owl" started in December, Gomes said. For years, the company gave more care to making sure there wasn't misleading information in response to two types of queries: those for personal health and finance. Now it's adding news as a third category. "Until recently, we thought we didn't need to do that for news because news typically comes from high authority pages," Gomes said.

Twitter Facebook Russian hackers use OAuth, fake Google apps to phish users The phishing schemes can work, in spite of Google's 2-step verification, Trend Micro said. Michael Kan (IDG News Service) 26 April, 2017 10:54 - - - - print email Comments The Russian hacking group blamed for targeting U.S. and European elections has been breaking into email accounts, not only by tricking victims into giving up passwords, but by stealing access tokens too.  It's sneaky hack that's particularly worrisome, because it can circumvent Google's 2-step verification, according to security firm Trend Micro.  The group, known as Fancy Bear or Pawn Storm, has been carrying out the attack with its favored tactic of sending out phishing emails, Trend Micro said in a report Tuesday.  The attack works by sending out a fake email, pretending to be from Google, with the title “Your account is in danger.” Trend Micro An example of a phishing email that Fancy Bear has used.  The email claims that Google detected several unexpected sign-in attempts into their account. It then suggests users install a security application called “Google Defender.” However, the application is actually a ruse. In reality, the hacking group is trying to dupe users into giving up a special access token for their Google account, Trend Micro said. Victims that fall for the scheme will be redirected to an actual Google page, which can authorize the hacking group's app to view and manage their email. Users that click “allow” will be handing over what’s known as an OAuth token. Although the OAuth protocol doesn't transfer over any password information, it's designed to grant third-party applications access to internet accounts through the use of special tokens.  The OAuth protocol may have been designed for convenience, but security experts have warned it can be used for malicious effect. In the case of Fancy Bear, the hacking group has leveraged the protocol to build fake applications that can fool victims into handing over account access, Trend Micro said.   “After abusing the screening process for OAuth approvals, (the group’s) rogue application operates like every other app accepted by the service provider,” the security firm said. Even Google's 2-step verification, which is designed to prevent unwarranted account access, can't stop the hack, according to Trend Micro. Google's 2-step verification works by requiring not only a password, but also a special code sent to a user's smartphone when logging in. Security experts say it's an effective way to protect your account. However, the phishing scheme from Fancy Bear manages to sidestep this security measure, by tricking users into granting access through the fake Google security app. "The target might be familiar with generic phishing emails, but not so much with OAuth abuse tricks," Trend Micro said in its report. "Chances are significant that even well-educated targets get fooled." Google, however, said it takes many steps to protect users from such phishing attacks. "In addition, Google detects and reviews potential OAuth abuse and takes down thousands of apps for violating our User Data Policy, such as impersonating a Google app," the company said in a statement. "Note that a real Google app should be directly accessed from a Google site or installed from the Google Play or Apple App stores," it added. According to Trend Micro, victims were targeted with this phishing attack in 2015, and 2016. In addition to Google Defender, Fancy Bear has used other apps under names such as Google Email Protection and Google Scanner. They’ve also gone after Yahoo users with apps called Delivery Service and McAfee Email protection. Trend Micro The attack attempts to trick users into handing over access to their email through fake Google third-party applications.  “Internet users are urged to never accept OAuth token requests from an unknown party or a service they did not ask for,” Trend Micro said. Although a password reset can sometimes revoke an OAuth token, it's best to check what third-party applications are connected to your email account. This can be done by looking at an email account's security settings, and revoking access where necessary.  Fancy Bear is most notorious for its suspected role in hacking the Democratic National Committee last year. However, the group has also been found targeting everything from government ministries, media organizations, along with universities and think tanks, according to Trend Micro. 7 Habits of the Effective Network Manager More from NetScout Join the Computerworld newsletter!

It seems like an unthinkable proposition, however according to one company this could be the future of smartphone audio. UK-based tech firm Redux has developed a new type of surface audio technology which it claims removes the need for the frequently underwhelming micro speakers found in smartphones by instead channelling sound through the display. Trending: Google Home review: Can Google's smart speaker topple Amazon Echo and Alexa? Labelled ''bending wave'' technology, the solution uses tiny actuators to vibrate the screen of a smartphone and turn it into one big loudspeaker. Redux is using the same technology to bring advanced haptic feedback to mobile devices, which it believes is sophisticated enough to remove all need of physical buttons and allow for truly ''all-screen'' gadgets. Don't miss: Steve Wozniak: Apple, Google and Facebook will still be around and 'bigger' in 2075 The system, which Redux has already applied to PCs and in-car infotainment systems, uses signal processing algorithms to direct tactile sensations at specific touch points throughout a device's display. Actuators then deliver different effects to different fingers simultaneously, with the result being a "feeling of pressing a mechanical button or moving a slider control underneath your fingertips on the screen with button click effects coming directly from the display." Most popular: Unmanned Chinese cargo ship Tianzhou-1 docks with Tiangong-2 space lab The solution offers practical benefits, too. For one it makes mobile devices easier to waterproof – less holes means less change of moisture ingress, after all – meanwhile the lack of speaker apparatus means there is more space inside the device for other components. View photos Redux bending wave tabletMore "Our technology enables smartphone manufacturers to reclaim valuable space within phones, which could be filled by a bigger battery," said Redux CEO Nedko Ivanov. "Moreover, our surface audio technology is more power efficient than traditional micro speakers, which means people can play music and watch videos on their phones for longer between charges." Redux believes its solution could find its way into mobile devices in as little as two years and could eventually kill off smartphone speakers entirely. The company has launched a programme to let developers get to grips with its technology, which it claims is based on over 20 years of research and some 150 patents.

Engineering mobile moments As part of a recent report about the customer journey in Asia-Pacific, Econsultancy asked nearly 1,000 marketers about their ability to insert their brands into 'mobile moments'. The results indicate that around half of respondents felt that they did, in fact, engineer these 'mobile moments' which showed their brand in a positive light. But what exactly does that mean? According to Forrester, a 'mobile moment' is a point in time and space when someone pulls out a mobile device to get what he or she wants immediately, in context. And, it follows, that if brands want to engage the increasingly mobile consumer then marketers are going to have to position themselves into that moment and provide the value that consumers are looking for. Below are a list of five mobile moments and what brands can do to be a part of them, and win their customer's love and attention. Before we start Econsultancy Asia-Pacific has two events currently which may interest you: Webinar - Mobile: Trends, Data and Best Practice - on Thursday April 27th in the Asia-Pacific timezone.  Sign up here. Survey - We are looking for marketers in Australia and New Zealand to take part in a survey about marketing automation.  Click here to participate - and get a free copy of the report when it is published. 1) I want to know The first mobile moment is when a consumer suddenly needs some information, either out of interest or perhaps as a first step on the customer journey. According to research conducted by Google, two out of three (66%) consumers use their mobile to look something up that they have seen in a TV advert. Additionally, according to Nielsen, more than half (56%) of consumers in Asia-Pacific use their mobile to look up product information when shopping and a similar amount use their smartphone in many other similar ways as well. How can brands win this moment? As nearly all searches for information on mobile start with Google, brands should ensure that their sites are high in search results for the things consumers are likely to search for on mobile. While this can be accomplished through good SEO, marketers should also review their AdWords keyword strategies to ensure that they are not losing the top of the page to competitors. 2) I want to go Another mobile moment occurs when consumers are thinking of going somewhere, or even on the way, and they need to know more about their destination. Google's Consumer Barometer data indicates that 82% of consumers, globally, look for local information on mobile. While numbers are quite as high as that in Asia Pacific, in most Asia Pacific countries at least half of all consumers use their mobile devices to find local information.   For brands to be a part of this mobile moment, they should ensure that:  They are on Google Maps (if they have a physical presence) Their website is mobile-optimized Their site has easily-accessible locations and opening hours  3) I want to buy Perhaps the most obvious, and most-coveted by brands, mobile moment is when consumers are ready to buy something. Google reports that 82% use their smartphone in-store when deciding what to buy and Nielsen indicates that 60% use their mobiles to compare prices when shopping. According to the Consumer Barometer, many consumers also use smartphones to actually make a purchase in Asia-Pacific. The percentage varies considerably by country, but all brands in Indonesia should know that more than two in three consumers buy using their mobile device. There are countless suggestions for how marketers can improve mobile ecommerce, but perhaps the most important suggestion is that brands should avoid forcing their mobile customers to create accounts or do any typing of any significance. Point and click is the way to go on mobile. 4) I want to do Smartphones are not, however, only used out-of-home. Many consumers also use their mobiles as the most convenient way to get information while they are working on projects in their homes. These moments are classified as 'I want to do' and brands which offer products or services which help people with cooking, DIY, homework, or other in-house tasks need to be present at these times. Google's data indicates that more than 9 in 10 (91%) of consumers use their smartphone to find ideas when 'doing a task' and so marketers can consider this mobile moment as pertaining to just about everyone. To be a part of the 'doing' moment, brands should consider search terms which consumers use when trying to accomplish something - "How can I...", "fix ...", "best way to make ..." - and produce appropriate content to satisfy the consumer's requirements. 5) I want to show And finally, another emerging mobile behaviour which brands should be a part of is the moment where consumers want to share something with their friends or followers. According to research by travel site Kayak, more than half (54%) of travelers from Singapore use their smartphones on holiday (70% for those aged between 18 and 24), and the most popular reason is to share photos showing what they are doing while vacationing. For brands to be part of these mobile moments, marketers should consider doing experiential marketing in areas where people are on holiday or in crowded city centres. One excellent example of this is a recent experiential campaign dreamed up by Catalyst for The Economist. To encourage subscriptions, the agency set up stands in urban areas which offered insect-flavoured ice cream. Intended to be a thought-provoking exercise about using bugs as a source for protein for a growing global population, the event also provided many memorable images which were surely shared extensively on social media. So... In order to stay relevant on mobile, marketers need to break out of the habit of looking at the customer journey as steps along the buying funnel and instead consider the consumers' new, mobile behaviours. These mobile moments offer brands an opportunity to move beyond interruption-based advertising and become relevant to the tasks which matter most in the lives of their customers.

Google posts truly incredible night images captured by the Pixel and Nexus 6P Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/25 11:28am PDTApr 25, 2017 52 Plus 1 on G+ 362 Share on Facebook 96 Share on Twitter Total Shares510 Google News Nexus 6P Pixel Pixel XL Smartphone cameras have come a long way, but can you ever take images that rival a "real" camera? According to Google software engineer Florian Kainz, the answer is yes. Using a custom camera app and some post-capture editing , Kainz shows what the camera sensors in the Pixel and Nexus 6P can do in low light situations. Kainz says his little project was inspired by a chat with Google's Gcam team, which focuses on computational photography. The most visible Gcam contribution to Google's products is HDR+, which allows phones like the Pixel to take photos in dim lighting by combining as many as 10 burst shots. HDR+ isn't perfect, though. Sometimes there just isn't enough light to produce a good image. 64 4-second exposures, shot with Nexus 6P With long exposures and lots of individual images, Kainz reasoned it should be possible to get much better photos out of a smartphone's tiny camera sensor. To test this, he built a simple camera app with manual control over exposure time, ISO, and focus distance. The image at the top of the Point Reyes Lighthouse at night was Kainz's first test. This is a composite of 32 frames at 4-second exposure and ISO 1600, taken with the Nexus 6P. He also covered the lens and captured 32 completely black frames. The RAW image files were exported to Photoshop, where the mean of all 32 photos was computed, then the mean of the 32 black frames was subtracted. Below you can see what one of the individual HDR+ photos looked like. Impressive, no? A single 6P HDR+ frame Kainz did more tests with a variety of editing tricks, which you can read about in the full post. Below are some of the photos taken with the Pixel, but that phone only supports maximum 2-second exposures. Kainz speculates that a longer exposures could allow even better low-light photos on smartphones, assuming the subject is not moving and you have a tripod. Amusingly, the Pixel photos were taken in June and July last year, long before the phone was announced. 64 2-second exposures, shot with Google Pixel Many of the editing tweaks used to produce these images could be automated, too. You could imagine an app for Android or a mode in the camera that does most of this for you. Of course, the processing time for a few dozen RAW files would be rather lengthy on a phone. Maybe it could be built into Google Photos? If you want to see more photos from Kainz's experiments, there's a Google Photos album. 64 2-second exposures, shot with Pixel Source: Google Research Tags camera Google google research hdr nexus 6p photography pixel research subscribe ...

Random! Also, fucking skills of whoever is doing all the post processing in these pics. This ain't special about the Pixel and 6P after all, this post processing algorithm could be applied to any phone's pics. madcanada Any pics. Including a DSLR and night sky shots. Gonna try this weekend. shutUface 6p hdr post processing is really good. Throw the photos in snapseed for a little effect.

I'm dying for long exposure option in my phone. ChronoReverse The Htc 10 hardware can do stuff like this already. Here's a 900 second exposure: https://www.flickr.com/photos/maik_reifschneider/29419144492/ HebeGuess same sensors IMX377 as 5X/6P, different optics (with OIS). Pink tint at lower right corner was IR bleed from Laser Autofocus. James Doyle 64 pictures was all they could take before the 6P immediately shut down, probably while the battery read 35%. Snark aside, at this point I think maybe it's too soon to automate something like this on the phone itself, but this would be an amazing thing that Google Photos's AI could automate for us. David Ruddock Exactly. If you could use a stabilizer/tripod and upload the photos to the cloud. That would be nuts. James Doyle I'm almost there for just HDR+. A half dozen HDR+ images all trying to process brings my phone to a crawl, meaning I can't take any more pictures. Let's calm down the processing until I've stopped taking pics, or offload the work to the cloud. jonzey231 Yep. Totally agree with this statement. Once you've got a pretty dark photo trying to process or two decent images trying to process at once, the phone is basically a brick for the next 30 seconds. TSS TS 'The Cloud' doesn't work that way - Cloud based technologies fall under xaaS (IaaS/SaaS/DaaS) - The most common application is DaaS - Which is the only cloud space Google offers to residential consumers. Even if Google created an IaaS product scope, the limitations of current cell protocols would never allow 'processing' to be handed off to anything. Process threads are computed locally. There is nobody on this planet that has figured out how to parse thread computation over ANY WAN/LAN/Network to a central CPU farm to work out xyz process. The concept would be incredibly inefficient anyways. As the CPU processing the threads would have to process the inbound transaction, process the job, then redistribute back to the client. It would being doing 3-10x the work to say nothing have the transaction congestion, and security issues. Reference : Me, i'm a Sys Engineer/Admin. Toodles. Stuart Anderson His point is they could delay and/or limit the HDR+ work until after he's done taking pictures. And post processing like this doesn't need to be real time anyway. Jake Ashton lol. TSS TS got owned! leave it to the "experts" to think inside the box and just tell people what they can't do. toodles EH101 I think you're misunderstanding. What he means is take the 64 pictures (or 3 for regular HDR), let them all get uploaded as you normally would when you hit wifi, then let Google Photos online do the work to make the final picture. Not let the 'cloud' process something that stays on the device in real time. Google already does this to an extent, letting Google Photos 'read' the images and group them by face etc. Sean Buckman I'm using google pixel and I just keep shooting with no lag. It takes a bit(around 5-10 seconds) after taking the pictures to process the HDR+ but it doesn't slow the phone down. Matt I wonder how long it would take to upload 64 RAW files to the cloud... whispy_snippet With Australia's internet speeds I estimate 231 years and six days. Winston What are you talking about? I was there last year and loved the speeds I could get on LTE. But then again I was on Telstra... whispy_snippet I'm on Telstra too but I wasn't referring to cellular data speeds. I was talking about our total hash of an NBN. Sootie Yep nothing wrong with mobile data speeds but your not going to upload much on your 2gb data cap Vernonksims My last paycheck was $22500 for working 12 hours a week online.Start earning $97/hour by working online from your home for few hours each day with GOOGLE...

I wouldn't mind the wait if the phone could just do it fo me though. 7-down And yet, Google Camera app will be dry as bones with basic features. JohnyNoLegs It's like Google don't care about features. Like they think people will be happy with the most basic of applications. 2kool4skool ✓ⱽᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵇʸ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Google dumbed-down their apps to be as simple and as barebone as possible because apparently there are people that are scared with having options. These are the same people that call any phone or app that offers more than basic features as "gimmicks". JohnyNoLegs Completely agree. For some reason, there has always been a market for this. Feels to me it's for people who either don't do that much on their phone, or like buying third party apps for some reason. Tom Harman While I like my pixel, I'll stick to my D800e for 99% of my photos. madcanada Lol, I have a Canon 6D and I stick to Nexus 6P for 99% of my photos :D Patrick Comparing a 6D and a D800e is like comparing a Polaroid to a Leica. They're different tools for much different uses. That being said, I'm surprised that the Pixel wouldn't take over for the d800e... The simplicity, man! I don't shoot my d800 for anything but photo shoots now because the Pixel is too easy to get great shots and I don't have to spend hours in post. catalysto In the context of comparing to a smartphone, they are practically the same. Trent It's impressive, of course. But to suggest that even the best software will help a Pixel rival a DSLR is comedic. Good enough for most, they are, but put them up on a big screen next to similar shots from even a Nikon D3300 and the lack of pixels (amongst other things) will show which is better. There's also the small matter of all that editing hassle. Naturally, I shoot RAW with my DSLR, but a little time in Lightroom is generally all that's needed to make a shot pop. I appreciate that I'm being a little over-the-top in my condemnation, image quality/rivaling "real" cameras is about more than just how good something looks on a smartphone display. It's about being able to zoom in without a major loss of quality and casting the image to a TV and it not looking bad at that size. I do like my Pixel very much and it's great for casual shots. A DSLR replacement it is not, however. David Ruddock I think this is mostly about the power of light-gathering and composite HDR even when in use even with a tiny sensor. It bodes well for the future of algorithmic photography if nothing else - as sensors get better and algorithms do, too, we can keep pushing the limits of these already impressive methods. This example just takes it to an extreme as a showcase. madcanada This article is about the algorithm. You can apply the same process to a DSLR image making night sky shots even better. OhYeah! This is basicly only due to the Photo stacking technique. You can tell from the single image that each photo is pretty terrible but once you median stack the photos it can average out all the noise. You could create a photo that looked pretty great from a Galaxy S 3 if you really wanted to. madcanada Yes, that's what I said. OhYeah! Yep you kind of did in a different way. Good job, you can recognize similarities! TechGuy22 yet no one can buy the pixel thank god i was able to sell my 6p for 500 bucks and bought the xl rjyanj "no one can buy the pixel" "i bought the xl" hmm. TechGuy22 https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel_phone?hl=en-US can you buy it there ? that's what i meant dumb ass. i have an XL too. didn't buy it from google. nxtiak XL: Black 32gb and 128gb ships May 4th. Silver 32gb, available now, 128gb 3-4weeks. So Yes? Non XL are all out of stock. Shawn Spring I did the same, dumped the 6P after I had preordered the Pixel XL on launch day. Boy am I glad I did. Stevie_Wonder Shooting RAW (DNG) and manual exposure. Google just told us what we are missing from the Google Camera app. Thank you Google, but we knew that already. Mihai Ionescu What Manual camera app do you reccomend? WittyPixel a post that I made a while back in the 6p XDA forums, enjoy! https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-6p/themes-apps/nexus-6p-manual-camera-recommendations-t3340090 Lizzie McVeigh Adobe's Light Room Camera. You get full control of settings... up to 0.7" of exposure. Random! We desperately need that app you've mentioned, with manual controls for exposure time, aperture and ISO. Scott Olsen There's plenty of them already. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.flavionet.android.camera.pro Mike Or just get any phone that isn't developed by Google. My name is…. the smart choice martesque Like say, the LG V20 camera app. Defenestratus Took this picture on my old Nexus 6P of my neighbor's house the other day while walking the pooch. Moon was right behind the light house. the picture is pretty grainy but still pretty impressive given how dark it was outside (even though it doesn't look like it in the picture, I think Google Photos messed with the settings a bit) https://goo.gl/photos/1VBuUKxRGC7Dutyh7 Rod URL not found Ahamid17 Its a shame I had to give up my 5X for an iPhone because of that boot loop issue other than that I really loved my 5X camera Ahamid17 I would love to see the process in which he combined that 64 and 32 frames to get that result and imagine in the future if your camera app could do that in app instead of doing it on photoshop Tauran This needs to be an automated processing trick on Google photos. HDR is great but people like me don't have time to process photos manually to look this great. WittyPixel Salty post... "This is a composite of 32 frames at 4-second exposure and ISO 1600, taken with the Nexus 6P" realizing google didn't unlock all the capabilities he builds an apps to do so. If google allowed apps to use the sensor to it's full capability then we could do the same and the camera would be truly amazing. Gjorgi Lazarovski I don't get what you're saying but the Camera2 API that's in Android since Lollipop allows this and is fully enabled on both phones. You just need the right app, like Manual Camera from the Play store for example. With a tripod and set of skills in Photoshop you're most likely to get the same results by yourself. Kyle Gospodnetich The Pixel and 6P camera drivers are limited to 2 second exposures max. There are many other phones from other manufacturers that can have much, much longer exposure times set via the Camera2 API. funky There is also a hack on xda to support longer exposures, I guess 4 sec WittyPixel future reference... link or it doesn't exist. and there is not one for the nexus 6p, fyi. WittyPixel camera 2 API does not allow that feature. bobinchicago Hey, my Nexus 6P would take great shots too if the battery life wasn't down to an hour and plunging down to 0 the moment I open the camera app. VAVAMk_2 Get a replacement battery dblock I honestly think even the 6P has a better camera than the S8+. I have only had the phone less than a week, but thus far it seems like the camera just isn't as good, back or front camera for that matter. And it may not be the sensors themselves, but perhaps the software. The Google Camera on the Nexus/Pixel devices is just too damn good. JohnyNoLegs Blind tests put the S8 on almost equal footing of the Pixel. It's all in the software. Hence why it takes so long to process images after you take them. Klugschwaetzer Mhh. I'm wondering why I see no star trails after 2 minutes. Stars should not be round, but elongated. Since they are quite round, it seems that this Mr. Kainz has adjusted for earth's motion somehow. But then the branches of the trees should be blurry. Very strange indeed. ChicagoPete I hope you've taken the last 12 minutes to read the source post for this article. Klugschwaetzer I have. Have you? 64 images with two second exposure each means that not counting an intervall between shots you look at the sky for over 128 seconds. The stars will have moved by that time making a virtual overexposure very difficult. Unless he somehow compensated for that. But I don't see how he could have done that - as I said before. Klugschwaetzer Just read the source article. Thanks for pointing that out. jwildman16 Two seconds, not minutes. NinoBr0wn I've given up hope for Google to update their camera app to something above a passing grade. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good strategy by Google to do night pictures. That minimizes the chance of getting halos in the Pixel pictures. whispy_snippet Haven't you already been completely burnt in a camera debate that forced you to leave the discussion without a reply? Why would you want to do it again? Mix I was like how in the heck can I do this with my Pixel!? ".....he built a simple camera app with manual control over exposure time" Dammit. New_Guy ....aaaa https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/24e29b3703f641799852ae78976add647c419d1f551c6dbd44d370d7d1efcc18.png nd it's now my wallpaper =) inthemidleofnowere What they need is to integrate exposure times, iso, and other of those 2 year old photography tools that have been present in Samsung and LG. Casper Pascal What?!?! How did he make the Nexus 6P do a 4-second long exposure shot? Nexus firmware just allows me to reach 1/5-second exposure time :( Follow Android Police 1.5M 466k 142k 109k Latest Deals 37 [Update: Now it's cheaper] Deal Alert: Get a 75" Sony LED UHD Android TV from Best Buy for $2150 today ($650 off) 2017/04/24 7:35pm PDTApr 24, 2017 56 dbrand debuts grippy new Black Dragon skin, offers 20% off storewide until midnight ET 2017/04/24 5:26pm PDTApr 24, 2017 14 [Deal Alert] Here are 35 temporarily free and 26 on-sale apps to get your week going 2017/04/24 2:54pm PDTApr 24, 2017 5 [Deal Alert] Ring Video Doorbell Pro down 20% to $199.99 on Amazon 2017/04/24 5:27am PDTApr 24, 2017 38 [Deal Alert] Get a Nextbit Robin for $136.99 ($163 off) from eBay 2017/04/23 12:36pm PDTApr 23, 2017 Latest Poll Inbox or Gmail?

And today, that's exactly what it did. Although it has unveiled several models of soundbars, going as low as $79 for a 28'' stereo variant, Vizio is focusing mostly on the 36'' 5.1 surround sound version of its SmartCast lineup - as seen in the picture. At $249.99, the wireless model also offers Bluetooth connectivity, and because it has Google's Chromecast built-in and is able to interact with devices hosting Google Assistant, you can control what it plays via Chromecast-enabled apps or simply by voice commands, respectively. Another product announced by Vizio is part of the Crave lineup of wireless speakers. The latest product, dubbed the Crave Go, is a portable speaker which can be either used as a home-wide audio network, or can simply be picked up and used as an on-the-go solution. With it also being Chromecast-enabled, you will be able to stream music to it from services like Pandora, Spotify, or Google's very own Play Music. It is available to order, but be warned as the Wi-Fi enabled speaker will set you back $199 at the firm's website. Vizio also put together a presentation of its 2017 soundbar offering, a video in which it described itself as "American's number one soundbar company". Here's what it looks like: It'll certainly be interesting to see how this all eventually works out for Vizio, as the reshuffling of the deck towards more entertainment-focused solutions does make a fair bit of sense.

The rebranded Google car division announced in a blog post late Monday it was taking applications to be part of its “early rider” programme in Phoenix, the capital of the US state, and its suburbs. “We’ll be accepting hundreds of people with diverse backgrounds and transportation needs who want to ride in and give feedback about Waymo’s self-driving cars,” said Waymo chief executive John Krafcik. “The goal of this program is to give participants access to our fleet every day, at any time, to go anywhere within an area that’s about twice the size of San Francisco.” Krafcik said as part of the trial Waymo was adding 500 hybrid minivans to its Arizona fleet — which began with 100 vehicles — as the group edges toward a ridesharing system similar to those offered by Uber, Lyft and others. “We want as many people as possible to experience our technology, and we want to bring self-driving cars to more communities sooner,” he said. “Our early riders will play an important role in shaping the way we bring self-driving technology into the world — through personal cars, public transportation, ride-hailing, logistics and more.” The tech giant has done extensive testing of the Google car, but in recent months has been working to adapt its software to operate on other vehicles — using Chrysler Pacifica cars in Arizona. Sergio Marchionne, CEO of Chrysler’s parent company FCA, said the collaboration “has been advantageous for both companies as we continue to work together to fully understand the steps needed to bring self-driving vehicles to market.” Waymo said it has been quietly conducting a small-scale trial over the past month in the Phoenix area, taking participants to work, school, soccer practices and other activities. Crowded pack Most major automakers and several other technology firms have been stepping up efforts on autonomous driving in recent years, contending these systems will eliminate the vast majority of road accidents. Apple is the latest to have obtain a testing permit in California. German luxury carmaker Daimler and auto parts supplier Bosch announced plans this month to work together to create completely driverless cars in the next few years. US-based Tesla is also stepping up efforts, as are several Chinese technology firms and the major US, Asian and European manufacturers. The Google car already has undergone millions of miles of testing. But the latest drive appears to be part of an effort to challenge Uber head-on. The two firms are in the middle of a heated legal battle, with Alphabet filing a lawsuit earlier this year accusing Uber of stealing its technology. Waymo announced at the Detroit auto show this year that it would develop its self-driving technology with multiple partners, positioning itself as an automotive supplier. — AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Drive Channel Most Viewed Now Week Uber wants to launch ‘flying cars’ by 2020 Why Mercedes might want to rent your car Alphabet’s Waymo offers free rides on its autonomous cars Mercedes-Benz Malaysia all gung-ho about 2017 with double digit growth in Q1 Malaysia Autoshow planned for November 9-12 Mercedes E-Class debuts in Malaysia BMW launches 7 Series plug-in hybrid Volvo Trucks Malaysia launches flagship FH Series (VIDEO) Lotus launches another lightweight road rocket Shanghai Auto Show: From copycat to electric mobility pioneer Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Reuters Video: Thai man murders baby, commits suicide on Facebook Live Reuters Video: Cuba’s Bay of Pigs invaded…by crabs!

Communications Minister Denis Naughten will meet with two other cabinet colleagues to decide who will create the role of the digital safety commissioner. One of the functions of the new watchdog would be to fast-track disputes over privacy, online harassment, and defamation. The Irish Examiner understands Mr Naughten will hold formal meetings with the heads of major social media operators here, as well as with search engine Google, which runs Youtube. Proposals are for the new watchdog to get statutory powers that would compel social media players, such as Facebook and Twitter, to remove abusive material. Minister Naughten wants to talk with the CEOs of the tech giants and seek their input into the setting-up of the new commissioner, especially given that the companies have their European hubs here. Minister Naughten will outline his concerns and plans this week, when he attends a child-safety conference being hosted by Google in Dublin. However, he has to also meet Justice Minister, Frances Fitzgerald, as well as Children’s Minister Katherine Zappone, so it can be decided which department will have responsibility for the new watchdog. This meeting is expected to take place after the Dáil reconvenes, in early May. One of the key questions for the new digital-safety commissioner position is what powers it will have to compel powerful companies, like Facebook or Twitter, to remove online material. Minister Naughten has highlighted cases of parents seeking to have harmful posts, and social media chatter, about their children taken down. A number of suicides of young people have also been linked to online bullying on different websites. The new commissioner will promote digital safety and will work with schools and young people. This would be similar to the system in Australia. A guideline or code on agreed take-down procedures by online publishers would also set the agenda, when decided by the minister overseeing the new digital safety office. Under initial proposals, if a social media operator refused to take down offensive or harmful material, the company could be forced to do so, if the new commissioner makes an application to the courts. This process would be fast-tracked, because concerned families often complain about the length of time it can take to remove harmful social media posts.

Login here or sign up here Tech Google rewrites its powerful search rankings to bury fake news Plan is to remove misleading, offensive pages from top results. Mark Bergen, Bloomberg  /  25 April 2017&nbsp23:56 Google isn’t planning to rid fake news from its search results — but it’s trying to purge it from the top. The Alphabet Inc. company is making a rare, sweeping change to the algorithm behind its powerful search engine to demote misleading, false and offensive articles online. Google is also setting new rules encouraging its “raters” — the 10,000-plus staff that assess search results — to flag web pages that host hoaxes, conspiracy theories and what the company calls “low-quality” content. The moves follow months after criticism of Google and Facebook Inc. for hosting misleading information, particular tied to the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Google executives claimed the type of web pages categorized in this bucket are relatively small, which is a reason why the search giant hadn’t addressed the issue before. “It was not a large fraction of queries — only about a quarter percent of our traffic — but they were important queries,” said Ben Gomes, vice president of engineering for Google. While Facebook has faced a backlash for the spread of fake news across its social network, Google has been criticized for results that leap to the top for specific queries. For example, last month for the search query, “is Obama planning a coup,” the top result produced a blatantly wrong article, and did so in a feature snippet — a text box that Google uses to give quick, authoritative answers. Gomes used this as an example of the type of search result the changes are meant to bury. “We were highlighting low-quality content in search results,” he said. Additionally, Google is applying the same new parameters for its “auto-complete” function, which finishes search questions based on popularity. Some of the auto-completes that are deemed offensive (such as “are women evil”) will be eliminated. Google is adding a feature to allow searchers online to flag these instances with a feedback form.  Earlier this month, the company introduced a tool allowing publishers to fact-check articles in its search rankings. The newer changes apply to the secretive, core algorithm behind all Google search rankings. The alterations were devised in an internal group called “Project Owl” started in December, Gomes said.  For years, the company gave more care to making sure there wasn’t misleading information in response to two types of queries: those for personal health and finance. Now it’s adding news as a third category. “Until recently, we thought we didn’t need to do that for news because news typically comes from high authority pages,” Gomes said. © 2017 Bloomberg Can we provide you with information on a FICA management tool?

Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg Larry Page has his flying cars. Sergey Brin shall have an airship. Brin, the Google co-founder, has secretly been building a massive airship inside of Hangar 2 at the NASA Ames Research Center, according to four people with knowledge of the project. It's unclear whether the craft, which looks like a zeppelin, is a hobby or something Brin hopes to turn into a business. "Sorry, I don't have anything to say about this topic right now," Brin wrote in an email. The people familiar with the project said Brin has long been fascinated by airships. His interest in the crafts started when Brin would visit Ames, which is located next to Google parent Alphabet Inc.'s headquarters in Mountain View, California. In the 1930s, Ames was home to the USS Macon, a huge airship built by the U.S. Navy. About three years ago, Brin decided to build one of his own after ogling old photos of the Macon. The USS Macon entering Hangar One at the NASA Ames Research center in 1934. Photographer: Smith Collection/Gado via Getty Images In 2015, Google unit Planetary Ventures took over the large hangars at Ames from NASA and turned them into laboratories for the company. Brin's airship, which isn’t an Alphabet project, is already taking shape inside one. Engineers have constructed a metal skeleton of the craft, and it fills up much of the enormous hangar. Alan Weston, the former director of programs at NASA Ames, is leading Brin's airship project, according to the people, who asked not to be named discussing the secretive plans. Weston didn’t respond to requests for comment. Weston has a background befitting such an unusual enterprise. Born to Australian parents, Weston spent some of his youth in Turkey and then ended up at the University of Oxford. There he became a key member of the Dangerous Sports Club - a group of very intelligent risk-takers that formed in the early 1970s and did things such as catapult people across fields into nets. Members of the club are credited with inventing the modern form of bungee jumping. Weston, for example, performed one of the first bungee jumps by hurling himself off California’s Golden Gate Bridge and then eluded the authorities waiting to capture him on shore. He also hiked Mt. Kilimanjaro in Africa and then attempted to hang-glide down, only to crash and hurt his ankle in the process. Years later, Weston joined the Air Force and did engineering work as part of the U.S. government’s Strategic Defense Initiative - known more broadly as the Star Wars missile defense system. In 1989, Weston oversaw one of the first tests of Star Wars, which aimed to destroy incoming Russian missiles midair with weapons fired from space. Following his stint at the Air Force, Weston joined NASA and worked on a wide number of projects, including the development of a low-cost lunar lander. In a radio interview in 2013, Weston described plans for an airship that could be used to haul cargo. The idea is that airships could be more fuel-efficient than planes and could carry loads directly to where they're needed, rather than to transport centers like airports or shipping stations. "New airship technologies have the promise to reduce the cost of moving things per ton-mile by up to an order of magnitude," Weston said in the interview. "It depends on the size of the airship. A larger airship can reduce costs a lot more than a smaller ship, but there’s design of a class of vehicles that can lift up to 500 tons that could be actually more fuel-efficient than even a truck." Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up He went on to describe a prototype he was considering of a helium-based craft that appeared to breathe. "And so the way that works is that the helium in the main envelope is taken and stored in bags inside the airship at a slightly higher pressure," he said. "As you do that, air is taken in from the outside into essentially like lungs that are attached in the side of the vehicle. So the analogy of breathing is a good one. And the overall lift of the vehicle is equal to the weight of the air that is being displaced by the helium. And as you change that, you can control the amount of buoyancy that the vehicle has." This technique, according to Weston, would allow the airship to carry 500 tons without the need for a ballast. After being contacted about the airship, Weston changed his profile on LinkedIn to list his current job as chief executive officer of ``Ltare.'' He then removed the post.  There have been many attempts to build airships of this type in recent years. It's fitting for such a project to take place in Silicon Valley, which seems to have entered a steampunk phase, as people race to build things ranging from flying cars to tiny reusable rockets. Brin’s airship is separate from a freight project called Calcifer that was shelved by Google X, the company’s experimental research lab, in 2014. Alphabet CEO Page, Brin’s Google co-founder, has funded at least two secretive flying-car projects – startups Kitty Hawk and Zee.Aero, also separate from Alphabet. Page has begun to take the wraps off one of these efforts – on Monday, Kitty Hawk released a video showing one of its all-electric vehicles taking off and soaring over a lake with the driver perched on top. --With assistance from Mark Bergen.

Google and Viacom18's over-the-top (OTT) platform Voot have joined hands to launch a video-on-demand (VOD) progressive web app. PWA is a webpage that acts like an app. Google has developed PWAs for e-commerce portals such as Flipkart, but this is the first time it has launched a media app, specifically a video-streaming one, anywhere in the world. For OTT platforms, especially since all of them are focusing on consumption via mobile, a challenge has been to reduce the number of uninstallations by users. Often, users consume content then uninstall the app, mainly because of limited space on their phones. "Mobile websites in India are not very evolved and considering the data speeds in the country, they do not provide a very good experience. So, while people may want to watch some content, either because of limited memory on their phone or the not-so-pleasing experience of the mobile website, they may not come to a platform. We wanted to make sure that doesn't happen, and by introducing the PWA, we are casting a wider net because this means not only app-savvy users but those comfortable using mobile websites can also now watch Voot content with greater ease," says Gaurav Gandhi, chief operating officer, Viacom18 Digital Ventures, the arm of Viacom18 that runs and operates Voot. 5SHARES © 2017 Business Standard     Stay Updated with Us Top 10 Stories Last Week Last Month Last Year The IPL Fantasy League is back Digital L'Oréal India's Shalini Raghavan on marketing makeup...

The changes have been in the works for four months, but Google hadn’t publicly discussed most of them until now. The announcement in a blog post yesterday reflects Google’s confidence in a new screening system designed to reduce the chances that its influential search engine will highlight untrue stories about people and events, a phenomenon commonly referred to as “fake news.” “It’s not a problem that is going to go all the way to zero, but we now think we can stay a step ahead of things,” said Ben Gomes, Google’s vice president of engineering for search. Besides taking steps to block fake news from appearing in its search results, Google also has reprogrammed a popular feature that automatically tries to predict what a person is looking for as a search request as being typed. The tool, called “autocomplete,” has been overhauled to omit derogatory suggestions, such as “are women evil,” or recommendations that promote violence. Google also adding a feedback option that will enable users to complain about objectionable autocomplete suggestions so a human can review the wording. Facebook, where fake news stories and other hoaxes have widely circulated on its social network, also has been trying to stem the tide of misleading information by working with The Associated Press and other news organizations to review suspect stories and set the record straight when warranted. Facebook also has provided its nearly 2 billion users ways to identify posts believed to contain false information, something that Google is now allowing users of its search engine to do for some of the news snippets featured in its results. Google began attacking fake news in late December after several embarrassing examples of misleading information appeared near the top of its search engine. Among other things, Google’s search engine pointed to a website that incorrectly reported then President- elect Donald Trump had won the popular vote in the U.S. election , that President Barack Obama was planning a coup and that the Holocaust never occurred during World War II. Only about 0.25 percent of Google’s search results were being polluted with falsehoods, Gomes said. But that was still enough to threaten the integrity of a search engine that processes billions of search requests per day largely because it is widely regarded as the internet’s most authoritative source of information. “They have a lot riding on this, reputation wise,” said Lucy Dalglish, who has been tracking the flow of false information as dean of the University of Maryland’s journalism department. “If your whole business model is based turning up the best search results, but those results turn up stuff that is total crap, where does that get you?” To address the problem, Google began revising the closely guarded algorithms that generate its search with the help of 10,000 people who rate the quality and reliability of the recommendations during tests. Google also rewrote its 140-page book of rating guidelines that help the quality-control evaluators make their assessments.

The new initiative includes tweaks to the algorithm used by Google to deliver search results, while offering users more options to flag inappropriate content, including for “autocomplete,” or the suggestions Google makes while someone is typing a search query. “Our algorithms help identify reliable sources from the hundreds of billions of pages in our index,” Google vice president of engineering Ben Gomes said in a blog post. “However, it’s become very apparent that a small set of queries in our daily traffic (around 0.25 per cent), have been returning offensive or clearly misleading content, which is not what people are looking for.” Gomes said that Google is seeking to crack down on “new ways that people try to game the system.” “The most high profile of these issues is the phenomenon of ‘fake news’, where content on the web has contributed to the spread of blatantly misleading, low quality, offensive or downright false information,” he wrote. “While this problem is different from issues in the past, our goal remains the same — to provide people with access to relevant information from the most reliable sources available.” Both Google and Facebook have taken steps in recent months to curb the spread of hoaxes and misinformation amid concerns these may have influenced voters in the 2016 US election. Both firms have sought to cut off ad revenues to websites that promote false news, but have acknowledged they need to do more. Gomes said the latest effort is part of an ongoing process and includes “real people who assess the quality of Google’s search results” and provide feedback. The tweak in search ranking aims “to help surface more authoritative pages and demote low-quality content,” he added. Gomes said the effort aims to avert incidents that gained notoriety last year such as the high ranking of a website which claimed the Holocaust did not happen. Additionally, Google will make it easier for users to flag inappropriate “autocomplete” suggestions and “snippets” of website after some past embarrassments. “The content that appears in these features is generated algorithmically and is a reflection of what people are searching for and what’s available on the web,” Gomes said. “This can sometimes lead to results that are unexpected, inaccurate or offensive” Gomes said the new system enables users to “inform us directly if you find sensitive or unhelpful content.” “We plan to use this feedback to help improve our algorithms,” he added. — AFP-Relaxnews                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Hands on with the Samsung S8+ Forget flying cars; Google’s Brin secretly builds an airship Gadgets with Gurman: Should you buy Apple's latest iPad?

Today, however, with version 7.1.21.21, we can confirm that Google has indeed removed all reference to ‘Bisto’… Everyone can use an Echo Dot: Just $50! Removal of “Bisto” For those unaware, “Bisto” was a device type listed deep in the app’s strings.xml file alongside other major platforms like Android TV, Google Home, Pixel, Phone, and Android Wear. Other strings that we found referenced Google Assistant and the option for “Spoken Notifications” that can be “read aloud inside your headphones.” That would suggest that “Bisto” would have some kind of notifications that aren’t spoken, but that’s really all we could glean from these strings. It’s otherwise a complete mystery. Now, all these references have simply been deleted without a trace. The removal of strings referencing Bisto is perhaps one of the more notable changes in this update (if you care about Google minutiae and crazy rumors, that is). But there are other changes we’ve found in this 7.1 version of the Google app as well. Typing in Assistant It has long been known that Google is working on a way for users to enter queries for Google Assistant with the keyboard (like they can with Allo), and a new string seems to reference this capability: <string name=”opa_keyboard_indicator_content_description”>Type mode button</string> Assistant Shortcuts One feature that definitely isn’t enabled yet is something called “Shortcuts,” and it seems to be related to Assistant somehow. All we have to go off is the below string, but it appears you’ll be able to “create faster, easier ways” to do things. Hopefully we’ll know more soon. <string name=”assistant_settings_uda_shortcuts_description_empty_state”>Shortcuts let you create faster, easier ways to do your favorite things. Check out some popular ones below and get inspired to create your own!</string> Google has also modified the description of this feature in another string: <string name=”assistant_settings_uda_shortcuts_description”>Shortcuts let you create faster, easier ways to do your favorite things.</string> Delete Assistant history It appears Google is working on adding the ability to easily delete Google Assistant history directly from the Google app as well. Two new strings that describe this functionality: <string name=”opa_delete_confirmation_message”>”Your activity can make Google services more useful to you, like better commute options in Maps and quicker results in Search. Deleting from your Assistant history will not affect transactions or undo actions.”</string> <string name=”opa_delete_confirmation_title”>Before you delete</string> New icons Also found in this update are some new icons, one of which (left) is called “ic_pollen_count”. This would suggest that perhaps Google is preparing the Google app to provide smart pollen count information. There are also two new silhouette logos for what appears to be a headset and an Android Wear smartwatch.   Stephen Hall @hallstephenj Stephen is Managing Editor at 9to5Google. Twitter DMs are open.

Google posts truly incredible night images captured by the Pixel and Nexus 6P Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/25 11:28am PDTApr 25, 2017 52 Plus 1 on G+ 362 Share on Facebook 96 Share on Twitter Total Shares510 Google News Nexus 6P Pixel Pixel XL Smartphone cameras have come a long way, but can you ever take images that rival a "real" camera? According to Google software engineer Florian Kainz, the answer is yes. Using a custom camera app and some post-capture editing , Kainz shows what the camera sensors in the Pixel and Nexus 6P can do in low light situations. Kainz says his little project was inspired by a chat with Google's Gcam team, which focuses on computational photography. The most visible Gcam contribution to Google's products is HDR+, which allows phones like the Pixel to take photos in dim lighting by combining as many as 10 burst shots. HDR+ isn't perfect, though. Sometimes there just isn't enough light to produce a good image. 64 4-second exposures, shot with Nexus 6P With long exposures and lots of individual images, Kainz reasoned it should be possible to get much better photos out of a smartphone's tiny camera sensor. To test this, he built a simple camera app with manual control over exposure time, ISO, and focus distance. The image at the top of the Point Reyes Lighthouse at night was Kainz's first test. This is a composite of 32 frames at 4-second exposure and ISO 1600, taken with the Nexus 6P. He also covered the lens and captured 32 completely black frames. The RAW image files were exported to Photoshop, where the mean of all 32 photos was computed, then the mean of the 32 black frames was subtracted. Below you can see what one of the individual HDR+ photos looked like. Impressive, no? A single 6P HDR+ frame Kainz did more tests with a variety of editing tricks, which you can read about in the full post. Below are some of the photos taken with the Pixel, but that phone only supports maximum 2-second exposures. Kainz speculates that a longer exposures could allow even better low-light photos on smartphones, assuming the subject is not moving and you have a tripod. Amusingly, the Pixel photos were taken in June and July last year, long before the phone was announced. 64 2-second exposures, shot with Google Pixel Many of the editing tweaks used to produce these images could be automated, too. You could imagine an app for Android or a mode in the camera that does most of this for you. Of course, the processing time for a few dozen RAW files would be rather lengthy on a phone. Maybe it could be built into Google Photos? If you want to see more photos from Kainz's experiments, there's a Google Photos album. 64 2-second exposures, shot with Pixel Source: Google Research Tags camera Google google research hdr nexus 6p photography pixel research subscribe ...

Random! Also, fucking skills of whoever is doing all the post processing in these pics. This ain't special about the Pixel and 6P after all, this post processing algorithm could be applied to any phone's pics. madcanada Any pics. Including a DSLR and night sky shots. Gonna try this weekend. shutUface 6p hdr post processing is really good. Throw the photos in snapseed for a little effect. Ocepi https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/63d92d20e4febf4677fb9a1dbbdd2230d3563bf5f95c0c065225af6ddf0baf25.jpg Milton P. This, I need this in my life!!! I'm dying for long exposure option in my phone. ChronoReverse The Htc 10 hardware can do stuff like this already. Here's a 900 second exposure: https://www.flickr.com/photos/maik_reifschneider/29419144492/ HebeGuess same sensors IMX377 as 5X/6P, different optics (with OIS). Pink tint at lower right corner was IR bleed from Laser Autofocus. James Doyle 64 pictures was all they could take before the 6P immediately shut down, probably while the battery read 35%. Snark aside, at this point I think maybe it's too soon to automate something like this on the phone itself, but this would be an amazing thing that Google Photos's AI could automate for us. David Ruddock Exactly. If you could use a stabilizer/tripod and upload the photos to the cloud. That would be nuts. James Doyle I'm almost there for just HDR+. A half dozen HDR+ images all trying to process brings my phone to a crawl, meaning I can't take any more pictures. Let's calm down the processing until I've stopped taking pics, or offload the work to the cloud. jonzey231 Yep. Totally agree with this statement. Once you've got a pretty dark photo trying to process or two decent images trying to process at once, the phone is basically a brick for the next 30 seconds. TSS TS 'The Cloud' doesn't work that way - Cloud based technologies fall under xaaS (IaaS/SaaS/DaaS) - The most common application is DaaS - Which is the only cloud space Google offers to residential consumers. Even if Google created an IaaS product scope, the limitations of current cell protocols would never allow 'processing' to be handed off to anything. Process threads are computed locally. There is nobody on this planet that has figured out how to parse thread computation over ANY WAN/LAN/Network to a central CPU farm to work out xyz process. The concept would be incredibly inefficient anyways. As the CPU processing the threads would have to process the inbound transaction, process the job, then redistribute back to the client. It would being doing 3-10x the work to say nothing have the transaction congestion, and security issues. Reference : Me, i'm a Sys Engineer/Admin. Toodles. Stuart Anderson His point is they could delay and/or limit the HDR+ work until after he's done taking pictures. And post processing like this doesn't need to be real time anyway. Jake Ashton lol. TSS TS got owned! leave it to the "experts" to think inside the box and just tell people what they can't do. toodles EH101 I think you're misunderstanding. What he means is take the 64 pictures (or 3 for regular HDR), let them all get uploaded as you normally would when you hit wifi, then let Google Photos online do the work to make the final picture. Not let the 'cloud' process something that stays on the device in real time. Google already does this to an extent, letting Google Photos 'read' the images and group them by face etc. Sean Buckman I'm using google pixel and I just keep shooting with no lag. It takes a bit(around 5-10 seconds) after taking the pictures to process the HDR+ but it doesn't slow the phone down. Matt I wonder how long it would take to upload 64 RAW files to the cloud... whispy_snippet With Australia's internet speeds I estimate 231 years and six days. Winston What are you talking about? I was there last year and loved the speeds I could get on LTE. But then again I was on Telstra... whispy_snippet I'm on Telstra too but I wasn't referring to cellular data speeds.

I wouldn't mind the wait if the phone could just do it fo me though. 7-down And yet, Google Camera app will be dry as bones with basic features. JohnyNoLegs It's like Google don't care about features. Like they think people will be happy with the most basic of applications. 2kool4skool ✓ⱽᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵇʸ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Google dumbed-down their apps to be as simple and as barebone as possible because apparently there are people that are scared with having options. These are the same people that call any phone or app that offers more than basic features as "gimmicks". JohnyNoLegs Completely agree. For some reason, there has always been a market for this. Feels to me it's for people who either don't do that much on their phone, or like buying third party apps for some reason. Tom Harman While I like my pixel, I'll stick to my D800e for 99% of my photos. madcanada Lol, I have a Canon 6D and I stick to Nexus 6P for 99% of my photos :D Patrick Comparing a 6D and a D800e is like comparing a Polaroid to a Leica. They're different tools for much different uses. That being said, I'm surprised that the Pixel wouldn't take over for the d800e... The simplicity, man! I don't shoot my d800 for anything but photo shoots now because the Pixel is too easy to get great shots and I don't have to spend hours in post. catalysto In the context of comparing to a smartphone, they are practically the same. Trent It's impressive, of course. But to suggest that even the best software will help a Pixel rival a DSLR is comedic. Good enough for most, they are, but put them up on a big screen next to similar shots from even a Nikon D3300 and the lack of pixels (amongst other things) will show which is better. There's also the small matter of all that editing hassle. Naturally, I shoot RAW with my DSLR, but a little time in Lightroom is generally all that's needed to make a shot pop. I appreciate that I'm being a little over-the-top in my condemnation, image quality/rivaling "real" cameras is about more than just how good something looks on a smartphone display. It's about being able to zoom in without a major loss of quality and casting the image to a TV and it not looking bad at that size. I do like my Pixel very much and it's great for casual shots. A DSLR replacement it is not, however. David Ruddock I think this is mostly about the power of light-gathering and composite HDR even when in use even with a tiny sensor. It bodes well for the future of algorithmic photography if nothing else - as sensors get better and algorithms do, too, we can keep pushing the limits of these already impressive methods. This example just takes it to an extreme as a showcase. madcanada This article is about the algorithm. You can apply the same process to a DSLR image making night sky shots even better. OhYeah! This is basicly only due to the Photo stacking technique. You can tell from the single image that each photo is pretty terrible but once you median stack the photos it can average out all the noise. You could create a photo that looked pretty great from a Galaxy S 3 if you really wanted to. madcanada Yes, that's what I said. OhYeah! Yep you kind of did in a different way. Good job, you can recognize similarities! TechGuy22 yet no one can buy the pixel thank god i was able to sell my 6p for 500 bucks and bought the xl rjyanj "no one can buy the pixel" "i bought the xl" hmm. TechGuy22 https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel_phone?hl=en-US can you buy it there ? that's what i meant dumb ass. i have an XL too. didn't buy it from google. nxtiak XL: Black 32gb and 128gb ships May 4th. Silver 32gb, available now, 128gb 3-4weeks. So Yes? Non XL are all out of stock. Shawn Spring I did the same, dumped the 6P after I had preordered the Pixel XL on launch day. Boy am I glad I did. Stevie_Wonder Shooting RAW (DNG) and manual exposure. Google just told us what we are missing from the Google Camera app. Thank you Google, but we knew that already. Mihai Ionescu What Manual camera app do you reccomend? WittyPixel a post that I made a while back in the 6p XDA forums, enjoy! https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-6p/themes-apps/nexus-6p-manual-camera-recommendations-t3340090 Lizzie McVeigh Adobe's Light Room Camera. You get full control of settings... up to 0.7" of exposure. Random! We desperately need that app you've mentioned, with manual controls for exposure time, aperture and ISO. Scott Olsen There's plenty of them already. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.flavionet.android.camera.pro Mike Or just get any phone that isn't developed by Google. My name is…. the smart choice martesque Like say, the LG V20 camera app. Defenestratus Took this picture on my old Nexus 6P of my neighbor's house the other day while walking the pooch. Moon was right behind the light house. the picture is pretty grainy but still pretty impressive given how dark it was outside (even though it doesn't look like it in the picture, I think Google Photos messed with the settings a bit) https://goo.gl/photos/1VBuUKxRGC7Dutyh7 Rod URL not found Ahamid17 Its a shame I had to give up my 5X for an iPhone because of that boot loop issue other than that I really loved my 5X camera Ahamid17 I would love to see the process in which he combined that 64 and 32 frames to get that result and imagine in the future if your camera app could do that in app instead of doing it on photoshop Tauran This needs to be an automated processing trick on Google photos. HDR is great but people like me don't have time to process photos manually to look this great. WittyPixel Salty post... "This is a composite of 32 frames at 4-second exposure and ISO 1600, taken with the Nexus 6P" realizing google didn't unlock all the capabilities he builds an apps to do so. If google allowed apps to use the sensor to it's full capability then we could do the same and the camera would be truly amazing. Gjorgi Lazarovski I don't get what you're saying but the Camera2 API that's in Android since Lollipop allows this and is fully enabled on both phones. You just need the right app, like Manual Camera from the Play store for example. With a tripod and set of skills in Photoshop you're most likely to get the same results by yourself. Kyle Gospodnetich The Pixel and 6P camera drivers are limited to 2 second exposures max. There are many other phones from other manufacturers that can have much, much longer exposure times set via the Camera2 API. funky There is also a hack on xda to support longer exposures, I guess 4 sec WittyPixel future reference... link or it doesn't exist. and there is not one for the nexus 6p, fyi. WittyPixel camera 2 API does not allow that feature. bobinchicago Hey, my Nexus 6P would take great shots too if the battery life wasn't down to an hour and plunging down to 0 the moment I open the camera app. VAVAMk_2 Get a replacement battery dblock I honestly think even the 6P has a better camera than the S8+. I have only had the phone less than a week, but thus far it seems like the camera just isn't as good, back or front camera for that matter. And it may not be the sensors themselves, but perhaps the software. The Google Camera on the Nexus/Pixel devices is just too damn good. JohnyNoLegs Blind tests put the S8 on almost equal footing of the Pixel. It's all in the software. Hence why it takes so long to process images after you take them. Klugschwaetzer Mhh. I'm wondering why I see no star trails after 2 minutes. Stars should not be round, but elongated. Since they are quite round, it seems that this Mr. Kainz has adjusted for earth's motion somehow. But then the branches of the trees should be blurry. Very strange indeed. ChicagoPete I hope you've taken the last 12 minutes to read the source post for this article. Klugschwaetzer I have. Have you? 64 images with two second exposure each means that not counting an intervall between shots you look at the sky for over 128 seconds. The stars will have moved by that time making a virtual overexposure very difficult. Unless he somehow compensated for that. But I don't see how he could have done that - as I said before.

Symantec certificate authority issues, answered by Peter Loshin Site Editor Google and Mozilla weigh the proper response to Symantec certificate authority issues as the CA giant prepares an alternative proposal for reinstating trust.

Fortinet study shows HTTPS traffic has yet to surpass HTTP traffic Potential SSL API flaw could reveal private keys Google considers options on Symantec certificate authority 'failures' + Show More In this Article Share this item with your network: Related Content Symantec certificate authority issues listed by ... – SearchSecurity Risk & Repeat: Google slams Symantec certificates – SearchSecurity Symantec CA woes debated by browser community – SearchCloudSecurity Symantec responded to certificate issues raised by Mozilla just before the browser company's deadline last week, but the responses haven't eliminated concerns at Mozilla about Symantec certificate authority operations. Mozilla developer Gervase Markham earlier this month outlined 14 Symantec certificate authority issues and requested answers from the antivirus software giant. Symantec responded to the issues on Mozilla's developer forum, but Markham said there were still "open questions" about the issues and gave a deadline of last Thursday for the company to provide more information before Mozilla began considering potential actions. Symantec responded just before the deadline with a document that offered additional details on many of the certificate issues outlined by Markham. Symantec also requested the opportunity to submit its own remediation proposal for consideration instead of the more severe consequences that Google proposed last month after it announced it had discovered a "series of failures" with Symantec's certificate authority operations over several years. "We permitted WoSign to propose a remediation plan," Markham, wrote, referring to the Chinese certificate authority dropped from Mozilla's trusted certificate issuer list last year. "I think it is reasonable to do the same for Symantec. So we will wait to hear what they have to say, and then discuss appropriate action in the light of it." Google's proposal will reduce the validity period of new Symantec-issued certificates to nine months or less, will incrementally distrust existing Symantec-issued certificates in order to revalidate and replace them, and will remove Extended Validation (EV) status from Symantec-issued certifications until the browser community is assured that Symantec CA practices and policies are sufficient, but for at least one year, as indicated by Ryan Sleevi, software engineer and tech lead for Chrome's networking security team at Google, in Google's proposed framework. Issues with Symantec certificate authority activities, enumerated on a Mozilla developers forum, were addressed in Symantec's response and Markham reclassified three of the issues as "struck," one as "informational," and four as "minor" -- but six were classified as "major" and two as "intermediate." While Symantec responded to these issues, Markham expressed concerns with several of the responses and Symantec certification authority practices in general. For example, "Issue W" on Mozilla's forum highlighted issues with audits for Symantec's registration authority (RA) program [Symantec discontinued its RA program last month after Google's announcement]. "Symantec have asserted that their oversight of these RA partners was primarily based on reviewing audits," Markham wrote about Symantec's response. "However, the audits had a number of irregularities of various kinds, including being of the wrong type and so not covering the BRs [baseline requirements] at all, or not covering all issuance, which were not noted until recently. This claim of oversight therefore rings fairly hollow." Google's proposed deprecation of trust in Symantec certificates is in response to problems first uncovered in 2015 when test certificates for Google domains were improperly issued by the Symantec certificate authority. Since then, further issues related to Symantec CA improperly issuing test certificates have been revealed dating back to 2009; other issues raised relate to Symantec certificate authority audits, issuance of SHA-1 certificates after that cryptographic protocol was deprecated, and other issues related to satisfying the CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements for certificate authorities. Improperly issued test certificates were first detected in 2015 through Certificate Transparency (CT), after which all Symantec certificates were required to be posted to CT logs. Subsequently, a new set of improperly issued certificates were detected early in 2017, after which Google announced its intent to deprecate and remove trust in existing Symantec certificates because of the ongoing issues with misissuance of certificates and failures to properly validate certificates. Symantec certificate authority customers were notified that progress was being made with Google on the proposed plan to deprecate trust in certificates issued by Symantec certificate authorities. Roxane Divol, Symantec's senior vice president and general manager for website security, wrote in a blog post to customers that Symantec's "goal is to find a combined path forward that will ensure business continuity for our customers and peace of mind for all browsers and other industry stakeholders." Noting that the Google proposal would be disruptive to Symantec certificate authority customers, Divol wrote "the transition to fully adopt Google's proposal within its suggested timeframe would cause significant business disruption and additional expense - especially within complex IT infrastructures. Mitigating these concerns is a top priority for us as we develop our counter proposal and provide responses to the salient questions the community has posted online." Divol also assured Symantec certificate authority customers that if the Google proposal goes into effect, Symantec would reissue certificates at no additional charge. While Divol pointed to the "burden" created by Google's proposal, no mention was made in the post of questionable Symantec certificate authority practices. "While we believe Google understands the burden their proposal creates, if they decide to move ahead with their original plan, I want to reassure you that Symantec will keep your websites, web servers or web applications operational across all browsers. Specifically, this may require Symantec to reissue your certificates, which we would do as needed, at no charge to you, to meet the fully expected validity period."

Google has said the policy of non-retaliation applies whether or not workers ask for time off in advance of the day. For months now, workers across the country have been planning a May 1 General Strike across industries, with a focus on immigrant, low-wage, and subcontracted workers, in protest of Trump's administration's policies and in support of labor rights. SEIU-USWW, a powerful California-based local of the Service Employees International Union, has led the call, along with the Brandworkers food chain workers alliance. In the past few weeks, Facebook and other tech firms have committed to not retaliating against their employees who choose to demonstrate on that date, traditionally observed as International Workers Day. Labor advocates have pushed them to extend their policies towards their sub-contracted workforces as well, who are not directly employed by the tech giants. Facebook has said it would "re-evaluate its ties to any vendor if it breaks the law that protects workers’ rights to organize and protect themselves," Bloomberg reported. And Google said if it becomes aware of any illegal actions by vendors, it will investigate and take any necessary follow up. However, neither company provided more specifics on how they would protect contracted workers if the vendors who do employ them choose to retaliate. "We respect everyone’s choice to act on their beliefs," a Google spokesperson wrote in a statement provided to BuzzFeed News. "We care deeply about creating an environment at Google where everyone — employees and contractors, engineers, cafeteria workers and janitorial staff — feels comfortable doing so. We’re asking managers to be flexible in accommodating time-off requests and have let our vendor partners know that we support them doing the same." In an email to Google suppliers reviewed by BuzzFeed News, with the subject line, “As May 1 approaches,” the company states, “As you’ve likely seen in the press, there has been some discussion around May 1 events in the U.S. I wanted to get in touch to let you know how we’re approaching this.” The email includes the above statement as well as the line, "It's our hope that you'll take a similar approach," and concludes by asking vendors to “reach out to your Google contact” if they “would like to discuss."

While Google, Facebook, and other tech companies permitted engineers and other highly-paid employees to take time off to protest when President Trump first instituted an immigration ban on Muslim-majority countries, the employers are being more explicit about mentioning their sub-contracted workers this time around. That's partly thanks to pressure and organizing by California-based labor groups like Silicon Valley Rising and unions like UNITE HERE, which have sent in-person delegations and letters to major corporations, asking that they specify their policies towards the labor forces down the employment chain. Meghan Cohorst, a spokesperson for UNITE HERE, said in email to BuzzFeed News that the union is "very happy that Google has joined with other companies in the tech industry and made a public commitment to ensure that all workers employed in its offices are able to freely and safely participate in May Day actions."

Accordingly, this represents 1.2 trillion spam messages each year. This is even as Truecaller and Google have come together to improve video calling for millions. The strategic agreement is expected to integrate Google Duo, a high quality video calling service, within the Truecaller app. This will add a crucial communications layer that strengthens the value of Truecaller’s wildly popular dialler, caller ID, and spam blocking app already used by more than 250 million users globally. In the same vein, Truecaller has announced a completely new redesign of the Android app which now has a broader array of features like; instantly seeing who is sent you a text message to filter spam messages and flash messaging which allows you to send quick pre-defined messages to any Truecaller user notifying them of distress, that you are on your way, your location, or that you have reached home. Speaking on the new features, Nami Zarringhalam, Co-founder and CSO of Truecaller, said; “From the beginning we have worked relentlessly to build a product that helps simplify communication for consumers across the globe, and help them address important needs such knowing the identity of those calling, and blocking unwanted numbers. With valuable partners like Google, we are excited to take the next step in our journey, bringing all your mobile communications under one roof and giving you the safest, most efficient, and most convenient experience possible without having to switch back and forth. “The new look and feel of Truecaller is consistent with its ongoing commitment to provide a safe and efficient experience for millions of mobile users who have become increasingly frustrated by the growing problem of spam calls and texts from unknown users. Now, as one of the fastest growing mobile apps in the world, Truecaller sits at the centre of your mobile phone experience helping you connect with the people who matter, in the way you want to communicate, while avoiding calls and texts from those you don’t. “People use Truecaller to stay ahead. It helps them know who’s getting in touch, filter out unwanted and focus on what really matters. The company provides a suite of unique services such as a dialer that offers caller ID, spam detection, messaging and more. Truecaller’s mission is to build trust everywhere by making communication safe and efficient.” Zarringhalam revealed.

 Apple might compete with SpaceX in an unexpected business Evan Niu, The Motley Fool Apr. 25, 2017, 6:44 PM 2,389 facebook linkedin twitter email print A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket lifting off. Joe Skipper/Reuters Investors already know that Apple is actively searching for its next big hit, be it autonomous electric cars, augmented reality, or a toaster-refrigerator. There's now a clue of another possible idea floating around Cupertino: space internet. Bloomberg reported on Friday that Apple has poached two high-level Alphabet executives that worked on satellite and spacecraft projects for Google, John Fenwick and Michael Trela. Trela served as Google's head of satellite engineering from August 2014 to March 2017, according to his LinkedIn profile. Fenwick was Google's head of spacecraft operations over the same time frame, according to his LinkedIn profile. Neither executive's profile has been updated to mention Apple. Apple may have "potential interest in space" The report notes that aerospace giant Boeing has expressed interest in pursuing space internet with a network of 1,000 satellites, saying that Boeing has held talks with Apple as a potential investor and partner. Apple may in fact be helping fund the project, according to Bloomberg, citing a blog post from satellite and telecom consultant Tim Farrar, but Apple's involvement beyond that is unclear. Farrar wrote last month, "Boeing has also indicated to these people that it does not need export credit funding for the project, which supports the idea that this project is backed by a deep pocketed US entity." After ruling out other tech giants that have expressed extraterrestrial interest, Farrar concludes, "That only leaves Apple as never having discussed publicly its potential interest in space." Apple does have the deepest pockets of any company on Earth, after all. Tim Cook vs. Elon Musk This all comes a few months after The Wall Street Journal got ahold of leaked financials for Elon Musk's SpaceX, which is privately held. Of course, SpaceX's primary mission is to achieve full and rapid reusability of rockets in order to realize massive reductions in the cost of space travel, which the company hopes will pave the way for subsequent colonization of Mars. The business is currently built on launch contracts, but the internal information that was obtained shows that SpaceX has lofty ambitions for creating a satellite internet business within a matter of years, potentially starting as early as 2019. SpaceX's projections estimate that the service could garner 40 million subscribers and generate over $30 billion in revenue by 2025, according to the report. In contrast, the launch business is only expected to bring in $5 billion in sales that year, meaning that SpaceX believes that there's much more financial opportunity in beaming space internet down to Earth than launching reusable rockets. Operating income is forecast between $20 billion and $25 billion in 2025, which would largely be driven by the new business. The company had previously disclosed plans to launch over 4,400 satellites into low-Earth orbit to deliver low-latency internet from space, but had not mentioned financial expectations. Apple has been wanting to grow services revenue People have been dreaming of space internet for over a decade, and there have been many casualties over the years. But as things tend to go in technology, things change rapidly over time, and that rate of change only accelerates. Falling costs have opened up the potential for a new wave of space entrepreneurs; start-up OneWeb raised $1.2 billion last year to build and launch a space internet network. It's entirely possible that Apple has something else in mind, but given the company's heavy emphasis on services in recent quarters, it seems conceivable that Apple sees potential in building a strong base of recurring revenue from a literal moonshot like space internet. However, even if you accept SpaceX's forecast, $30 billion still isn't a game changer on Apple's income statement, although it would be a welcome addition to the services segment (currently a $25 billion business). There would immense costs associated with building such a constellation, but the Mac maker is currently sitting on the most cash that it's ever had ($246 billion at last count, before factoring in debt). Space internet revenue also wouldn't have as high of margins compared to Apple's terrestrial services, given these costs. Still, I'm hoping that Apple one day announces "the most extraterrestrial service we've ever made." 10 stocks we like better than Apple When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.* David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now… and Apple wasn't one of them!

Google's new search tools and changes could help combat fake news Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/25 10:37am PDTApr 25, 2017 15 Plus 1 on G+ 23 Share on Facebook 55 Share on Twitter Total Shares93 Google News Since time immemorial (1998) Google's bread, butter, and raison d'être has been search. Now Google's changing the way search works a bit, empowering users by adding new feedback tools and changing results from their search ranking to bring you more relevant and accurate information. With these changes users should see less in the way of so-called "fake news" and other non-factual content (excluding searches for that material), and more accurate and relevant information pertaining to their search. The biggest user-facing change you are likely to see is probably the new feedback link. It allows users to tag snippets —the short bits of text you might see that directly answer questions posed in a search —or autocomplete results as being accurate, inaccurate, offensive, or just disliked. There's no telling yet exactly how Google may or may not use the data collected via reports, but at a minimum it may go some way to prevent a few of the problems they've seen. I know in the past I've seen snippets come up that are either entirely incorrect or totally unrelated to a search. Hopefully this doesn't just present a new vector for further rank manipulation in autocomplete, though. The changes to search sorting are pretty straightforward. Google's had some problems in the past with sites manipulating how they appear on results. After all, anything that's governed by a set of rules can be gamed using those rules. Even without that Google's had some problems with factually inaccurate results appearing on top of results. They'll be making new changes to ranking to avoid that sort of thing in the future, and they're redoubling their efforts with Google's human oversight in determining quality of results. Their content policy has been updated with the details, and their educational portal on how their Search works has also been changed. Until we see how searches are changed there's no way to know if the new tools might open another means for manipulation of results. While it's possible some might use it as a means of censorship or calumny, hopefully the system is robust enough to resist that type of manipulation. Either way, we shall see.

Branko It's called free speech idiot. Now go and read 1984 before worshipping a private corporation with political interests who has the majority of search traffic. Ozl LOL M. Luciano Damn, MJ was spot on. He said you're coming and here you are! F4LL0U7 Well yesterday's March For Science post is a pretty good indication of how this comment section is about to play out... M. Luciano I must have missed it - wtf is controversial about supporting science? F4LL0U7 A lot, apparently! Check it out. http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/04/24/went-protest-app/#comment-3271548575 Sir_Brizz I think it's wrong to simplify both the "March for Science" and whatever happened in that comments section to "supporting science". Most people would agree with "supporting science" but it is rarely that simple. If you don't understand what problem a reasonably intelligent person would have had with the march or that post, then that probably warrants further investigation on your part to form your own opinions. M. Luciano I was surprised to hear that there was any controversy over the march for science. Science seems like one of the most uncontroversial things one could "march" for. The article didn't mention any controversy, unless people creating an app to collect data at protests is controversial, but then almost every app on every platform would be controversial. Nicholas Conrad It wasn't a march for science, it was just called a march for science. It was a march in support of a particular set of policy prescriptions. Anyone who really supports science would know that science can't be in favor of one policy or another, it can only inform the discussion of costs and benefits of varying policies which then have to be weighed. M. Luciano Furthermore, a Google search for "March for Science Controversy" turns up no controversy. Just a bunch of articles explaining who and what is going on. Is there an actual controversy? People supporting the scientific method and it's application to the challenges of our current world and society... that's not controversial. Nicholas Conrad Clearly a media conspiracy; is mj lamestream? MJ The first of the manipulated BLOCKED! This is NOT a free speech issue so I would suggest a First Amendment 101 class. cooldude5500 Man I loved to search something weird for the predictions so that I could see the most outrageous thing that people were searching for. It was fun, however racist or sexist the predictions would be. Loved to see how weird some people were.

Sir_Brizz You need to search for it on Google first. Javier180 See I will no longer see CNN in my search results? :D Sir_Brizz Please? Christopher Glass These kinds of people are why the fight is useless. Because anything that doesn't conform with what they want to believe is 'fake'. They don't understand what words mean. Sir_Brizz I presume by "these kinds of people" you mean CNN, right? Christopher Glass I mean YOU. Nicholas Conrad I mean, but clearly you also from that response, so.... madcanada You're precisely the reason why the fight is useless. You will simply believe whatever mainstream media tells you is true. Why bother if you standard of quality is mainstream media? Vivek Rameses So they're censoring what the govt doesn't agree with? Is this new China? FernandoRocker No. Just made in China. M. Luciano What? No. The government isn't mentioned, at all and that's not how it works. They're 1) Not censoring anything and 2) Trying to promote accuracy in search results Vivek Rameses If I were to use Google at least I won't see any CNN, Fox news and the likes. That would be a plus. rebretz000 I think the fact that a tool like this is needed is biggest problem. I can't believe that there are persons out there so gullible that they will believe almost anything posted online. Averix A lot of people don't cross check articles and only read headlines. Sites that base their existence off of ad revenue by getting people into a "click hole" of fake news stories have the psychology of morons figured out. David Warthen We must get rid of the fake news so you can be inundated with all the real news that's completely made up. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ As long as I can filter out /r/the_donald I think that will take care of the majority of it. F4LL0U7 Heads up, a handful of users you've never seen on AP before are about to rain their barely literate rantings upon you. As an example, check out the March For Science post from yesterday. A Person People who attend science marches only push their belief in science when it suits their interests, not when it comes to male is male and female is female. M. Luciano Did that make sense when you wrote it? A Person Yes, it makes sense. M. Luciano What exactly is the scientific understanding of the relationships between sex and gender? We could try sociological, biological and psychological. Let us know when you're ready to read up on the hundreds of peer reviewed studies and provide an analysis. F4LL0U7 People who say things like that have likely never had a child, relative, or friend who turned out to be trans. And even if you haven't, why not try having a little empathy? Life might be more enjoyable, and you might be less angry at things that have absolutely no impact on you whatsoever. A Person That is very selfish of you to enforce others believe or acknowledge something simply because you yourself have experienced. If you have a friend, child, or relative that thinks they should have been the opposite sex, and you didn't attempt to get them psychiatric help, then you dropped the ball. F4LL0U7 I'm sure I should just block you and end this waste of time, but I'll ask anyway: do you think homosexuals need psychiatric help as well, or do you think that's a valid way for a person to live their life? A Person I'm sorry, do all homosexuals think you can switch back and forth between male or female, or whatever other gender you want to make up? If that is the case, then we can talk. I see "other person typing"... but sorry, I'm out... you people are batsh!t crazy. fijisiv Dude keep it up. I have never seen somebody so proud of their ignorance! Is it painful to watch? Is it sad? Is it humorous? Yes. F4LL0U7 Really? Never? (Had to bring it all back around to Devin's OP) https://az616578.vo.msecnd.net/files/responsive/embedded/any/desktop/2016/07/30/636055042891058227364682665_2.jpg Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Kudos to you and @disqus_DIvkrvAJjQ:disqus for attempting to educate @disqus_abcdefg:disqus, but sadly it seems they would rather hide in their little hole and pretend the world is black and white. F4LL0U7 You'd have to take a survey. But I would bet that most of them would be open to modern science, empathy, and leaving people the hell alone. That question was just a litmus test for your level of tolerance to other humans that may or may not fall into your perfect worldview. Sir_Brizz I'll vote for leaving people alone, although that is something that is rarely afforded to others. Nathan Walters You're the one refusing to acknowledge empirical evidence and human experience. Pot, meet kettle. MJ Holy Crap! I could have sworn that I BLOCKED (fixed) you long ago. Dude, stop with your endless ignorant comments. You have never said anything resembling intelligence on any subject here. Are people really this dumb or are most of them actually just trolls? Impossible to tell or know I guess... F4LL0U7 If you're out, does that mean you're not coming back, and I don't have to bother blocking you? Nathan Walters Wait, do you even know what science has to say about issues of biological sex? I'm guessing not. A Person Science says there are two genders, not Facebook's 58... or whatever count they're up to now. F4LL0U7 Sure, if the most recent science book you've read is the bible. A Person LOL... I haven't said anything about the bible. You're a guy or a girl and whatever logic you want to make up in order to twist two genders into 50+... well, let me get my popcorn. M. Luciano This is just as false as it was 4 minutes ago. Most people are a guy or a girl or both, but some are neither. F4LL0U7 I'll refer you to @disqus_DIvkrvAJjQ:disqus's post above, since they've already done the research, and I have to get back to work. M. Luciano You're wrong. "Science" holds 8 known sexes and three known genders. The sexes are X0, XX, XY, ZZ, ZW, WW, Hermaphrodite and asexual. The genders are male, female and neuter. This does not include chromosomal anomalies, such as XXY, XXYY, X and XXX. A Person lol... This is like if I were to argue that "tires can only be round", so your argument becomes "round isn't the only shape". M. Luciano No, it's as if you said, "people are male or female" and then I stated that the scientific understanding is that people are one of eight sexes and one of three genders. Because that's what actually happened. So you were incorrect because you were ignorant of the actual information available to you, now that you have it, you can learn. A Person Dude, I brought up gender and you brought up sex. Why do SJWs like yourself feel it necessary to complicate things as much as possible? M. Luciano You used them interchangeably with Nathan Walters, so figured you wanted to know that they're different. But even if you want to stick to gender only, there are 3, not 2. A Person I didn't use them interchangeably. I brought up gender. He then brought up sex. I didn't bring up sex. This is ridiculous. M. Luciano He brought up sex, you then referred to it as gender ... either way, 3 > 2. And either way, it has absolutely nothing to do with the overall topic of search results. F4LL0U7 The world is complicated, dude. And if something as simple as rethinking your pronouns can make life a little less complicated for people who are having a hard enough time as it is, then why not do it? In your mind, is being a Social Justice Warrior a bad thing? Seems like fighting for social justice is something to be proud of. F4LL0U7 More accurately, it's as if you said "tires are the only things that allow vehicles to move" and then @disqus_DIvkrvAJjQ:disqus cited tank treads, skis, wings, and propellors as other examples. A Person You're right, he/she/ze/it/them/they sounds even crazier when you put it that way. F4LL0U7 Maybe this concept wouldn't be so difficult for you if you spoke another language. Most other languages besides English have gender-neutral pronouns. If English did, then maybe you wouldn't be so offended by having to consider someone's gender identity before referring to them. Nathan Walters There aren't even only 2 sexes, why should the existence of more genders come as any surprise? Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a1ca661e6cd51072403c87d1161ea33d1aa68181de414832321558ead5d02819.jpg Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8f111e2cbfab6a1ab9e37e4dcb1b4e74b67793df6767debf1233b63590f83b15.jpg F4LL0U7 It's funny because 1) you think I'm a Democrat, and 2) you are hours late to this discussion and are making the same exact mistake as @disqus_abcdefg:disqus. kr3000 Excellent, a right wing news blocker. Because diversity of thought is like fascist and stuff. C Lo What could possibly go wrong... Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Bahahahahaha! As if I trust Google. I tried this myself with Google vs. Duckduckgo, searching for "Hillary Clinton is a". The results for Google have changed slightly, but they're still flattering. Duckduckgo still suggests criminal, liar, crook, murderer, etc. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/50818a751a00330950eceeca37a2b4d6b8f74ee8691ca9854e4ade9962a6264e.jpg F4LL0U7 Try that with any person in Google and you'll see the same discrepancy. Google already explained this (several months ago, welcome to the party!). They don't associate people's names with negative words in autocomplete. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ That's funny, because I get "Donald Trump is a" cheeto, dinosaur, democrat (now THAT is an insult) on Google. In fact, I get a lot of insulting suggestions for other people. "Bill O'Reilly is a" wife beater? So your explanation does not pass the smell test. F4LL0U7 You won't get suggestions about Trump being a liar (despite video evidence) or a crook (despite him settling out of court for defrauding attendees of his "university"). Google simply does not suggest terms like that. Here's an idea -- Google it. It was in the news almost a year ago. Doby Gillis Seems you need to look up safe space since you're acting like a special, little, snowflake. Bruce Wayne Google is notoriously liberal so it's no surprise that they suppress negative comments about a liberal former presidential candidate and boost negative comments about a Republican president. I just looked up "Hillary Clinton is a..." and I got democrat, war hawk, hologram and hero. I did the same for Trump and got dinosaur, cheeto, gemini etc. And Google expects us to trust them with filtering for "fake news". HA! Scott Will the Google App get search tools?? D.Smithee How about they combat the absolute deluge of fake reviews in the Play Store. Geezus.

The main aim is to bury the bad results from bogus sources, promoting accurate results from authoritative sources. Google is also promising to be more transparent about its products, and by announcing this it’s clearly off to a good start. The internet has changed everything. It means that everyone now has access to more information than they could ever want, and it’s all just a click away. Unfortunately, we rely on gatekeepers such as Google More Than Search: 5 Things Google Has Done For The World More Than Search: 5 Things Google Has Done For The World Google has come a long way since starting up as a rinky-dink search engine that played second fiddle to what Yahoo! had to offer.

In order to achieve this it has updated its algorithms, developed new guidelines, and built new feedback tools. The first thing Google is doing is making changes to how it chooses what content to surface. This involves a) adjusting its signals to rank more authoritative sources higher up its results while deranking low-quality content, and b) giving new guidelines to the human evaluators identifying areas in need of improvement. Next, Google is making it easier for people to flag bad content. Google states that anything which appears in Autocomplete 12 Interesting Google Suggest Results & What They Reveal 12 Interesting Google Suggest Results & What They Reveal Google Search is the modern world's confessional.

Lastly, and on a wider note, Google is promising to be more transparent about its products. To this end, the company has updated its How Search Works microsite. Perfection Is Impossible These changes all seem decidedly sensible. However, Google Search still won’t be perfect. Google sifts through so many articles from so many sources that the odd mistake is bound to happen.

Google posts truly incredible night images captured by the Pixel and Nexus 6P Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/25 11:28am PDTApr 25, 2017 52 Plus 1 on G+ 362 Share on Facebook 96 Share on Twitter Total Shares510 Google News Nexus 6P Pixel Pixel XL Smartphone cameras have come a long way, but can you ever take images that rival a "real" camera? According to Google software engineer Florian Kainz, the answer is yes. Using a custom camera app and some post-capture editing , Kainz shows what the camera sensors in the Pixel and Nexus 6P can do in low light situations. Kainz says his little project was inspired by a chat with Google's Gcam team, which focuses on computational photography. The most visible Gcam contribution to Google's products is HDR+, which allows phones like the Pixel to take photos in dim lighting by combining as many as 10 burst shots. HDR+ isn't perfect, though. Sometimes there just isn't enough light to produce a good image. 64 4-second exposures, shot with Nexus 6P With long exposures and lots of individual images, Kainz reasoned it should be possible to get much better photos out of a smartphone's tiny camera sensor. To test this, he built a simple camera app with manual control over exposure time, ISO, and focus distance. The image at the top of the Point Reyes Lighthouse at night was Kainz's first test. This is a composite of 32 frames at 4-second exposure and ISO 1600, taken with the Nexus 6P. He also covered the lens and captured 32 completely black frames. The RAW image files were exported to Photoshop, where the mean of all 32 photos was computed, then the mean of the 32 black frames was subtracted. Below you can see what one of the individual HDR+ photos looked like. Impressive, no? A single 6P HDR+ frame Kainz did more tests with a variety of editing tricks, which you can read about in the full post. Below are some of the photos taken with the Pixel, but that phone only supports maximum 2-second exposures. Kainz speculates that a longer exposures could allow even better low-light photos on smartphones, assuming the subject is not moving and you have a tripod. Amusingly, the Pixel photos were taken in June and July last year, long before the phone was announced. 64 2-second exposures, shot with Google Pixel Many of the editing tweaks used to produce these images could be automated, too. You could imagine an app for Android or a mode in the camera that does most of this for you. Of course, the processing time for a few dozen RAW files would be rather lengthy on a phone. Maybe it could be built into Google Photos? If you want to see more photos from Kainz's experiments, there's a Google Photos album. 64 2-second exposures, shot with Pixel Source: Google Research Tags camera Google google research hdr nexus 6p photography pixel research subscribe ...

Random! Also, fucking skills of whoever is doing all the post processing in these pics. This ain't special about the Pixel and 6P after all, this post processing algorithm could be applied to any phone's pics. madcanada Any pics. Including a DSLR and night sky shots. Gonna try this weekend. shutUface 6p hdr post processing is really good. Throw the photos in snapseed for a little effect. Ocepi https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/63d92d20e4febf4677fb9a1dbbdd2230d3563bf5f95c0c065225af6ddf0baf25.jpg Milton P. This, I need this in my life!!! I'm dying for long exposure option in my phone. ChronoReverse The Htc 10 hardware can do stuff like this already. Here's a 900 second exposure: https://www.flickr.com/photos/maik_reifschneider/29419144492/ HebeGuess same sensors IMX377 as 5X/6P, different optics (with OIS). Pink tint at lower right corner was IR bleed from Laser Autofocus. James Doyle 64 pictures was all they could take before the 6P immediately shut down, probably while the battery read 35%. Snark aside, at this point I think maybe it's too soon to automate something like this on the phone itself, but this would be an amazing thing that Google Photos's AI could automate for us. David Ruddock Exactly. If you could use a stabilizer/tripod and upload the photos to the cloud. That would be nuts. James Doyle I'm almost there for just HDR+. A half dozen HDR+ images all trying to process brings my phone to a crawl, meaning I can't take any more pictures. Let's calm down the processing until I've stopped taking pics, or offload the work to the cloud. jonzey231 Yep. Totally agree with this statement. Once you've got a pretty dark photo trying to process or two decent images trying to process at once, the phone is basically a brick for the next 30 seconds. TSS TS 'The Cloud' doesn't work that way - Cloud based technologies fall under xaaS (IaaS/SaaS/DaaS) - The most common application is DaaS - Which is the only cloud space Google offers to residential consumers. Even if Google created an IaaS product scope, the limitations of current cell protocols would never allow 'processing' to be handed off to anything. Process threads are computed locally. There is nobody on this planet that has figured out how to parse thread computation over ANY WAN/LAN/Network to a central CPU farm to work out xyz process. The concept would be incredibly inefficient anyways. As the CPU processing the threads would have to process the inbound transaction, process the job, then redistribute back to the client. It would being doing 3-10x the work to say nothing have the transaction congestion, and security issues. Reference : Me, i'm a Sys Engineer/Admin. Toodles. Stuart Anderson His point is they could delay and/or limit the HDR+ work until after he's done taking pictures. And post processing like this doesn't need to be real time anyway. Jake Ashton lol. TSS TS got owned! leave it to the "experts" to think inside the box and just tell people what they can't do. toodles EH101 I think you're misunderstanding. What he means is take the 64 pictures (or 3 for regular HDR), let them all get uploaded as you normally would when you hit wifi, then let Google Photos online do the work to make the final picture. Not let the 'cloud' process something that stays on the device in real time. Google already does this to an extent, letting Google Photos 'read' the images and group them by face etc. Sean Buckman I'm using google pixel and I just keep shooting with no lag. It takes a bit(around 5-10 seconds) after taking the pictures to process the HDR+ but it doesn't slow the phone down. Matt I wonder how long it would take to upload 64 RAW files to the cloud... whispy_snippet With Australia's internet speeds I estimate 231 years and six days. Winston What are you talking about? I was there last year and loved the speeds I could get on LTE. But then again I was on Telstra... whispy_snippet I'm on Telstra too but I wasn't referring to cellular data speeds.

I wouldn't mind the wait if the phone could just do it fo me though. 7-down And yet, Google Camera app will be dry as bones with basic features. JohnyNoLegs It's like Google don't care about features. Like they think people will be happy with the most basic of applications. 2kool4skool ✓ⱽᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵇʸ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Google dumbed-down their apps to be as simple and as barebone as possible because apparently there are people that are scared with having options. These are the same people that call any phone or app that offers more than basic features as "gimmicks". JohnyNoLegs Completely agree. For some reason, there has always been a market for this. Feels to me it's for people who either don't do that much on their phone, or like buying third party apps for some reason. Tom Harman While I like my pixel, I'll stick to my D800e for 99% of my photos. madcanada Lol, I have a Canon 6D and I stick to Nexus 6P for 99% of my photos :D Patrick Comparing a 6D and a D800e is like comparing a Polaroid to a Leica. They're different tools for much different uses. That being said, I'm surprised that the Pixel wouldn't take over for the d800e... The simplicity, man! I don't shoot my d800 for anything but photo shoots now because the Pixel is too easy to get great shots and I don't have to spend hours in post. catalysto In the context of comparing to a smartphone, they are practically the same. Trent It's impressive, of course. But to suggest that even the best software will help a Pixel rival a DSLR is comedic. Good enough for most, they are, but put them up on a big screen next to similar shots from even a Nikon D3300 and the lack of pixels (amongst other things) will show which is better. There's also the small matter of all that editing hassle. Naturally, I shoot RAW with my DSLR, but a little time in Lightroom is generally all that's needed to make a shot pop. I appreciate that I'm being a little over-the-top in my condemnation, image quality/rivaling "real" cameras is about more than just how good something looks on a smartphone display. It's about being able to zoom in without a major loss of quality and casting the image to a TV and it not looking bad at that size. I do like my Pixel very much and it's great for casual shots. A DSLR replacement it is not, however. David Ruddock I think this is mostly about the power of light-gathering and composite HDR even when in use even with a tiny sensor. It bodes well for the future of algorithmic photography if nothing else - as sensors get better and algorithms do, too, we can keep pushing the limits of these already impressive methods. This example just takes it to an extreme as a showcase. madcanada This article is about the algorithm. You can apply the same process to a DSLR image making night sky shots even better. OhYeah! This is basicly only due to the Photo stacking technique. You can tell from the single image that each photo is pretty terrible but once you median stack the photos it can average out all the noise. You could create a photo that looked pretty great from a Galaxy S 3 if you really wanted to. madcanada Yes, that's what I said. OhYeah! Yep you kind of did in a different way. Good job, you can recognize similarities! TechGuy22 yet no one can buy the pixel thank god i was able to sell my 6p for 500 bucks and bought the xl rjyanj "no one can buy the pixel" "i bought the xl" hmm. TechGuy22 https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel_phone?hl=en-US can you buy it there ? that's what i meant dumb ass. i have an XL too. didn't buy it from google. nxtiak XL: Black 32gb and 128gb ships May 4th. Silver 32gb, available now, 128gb 3-4weeks. So Yes? Non XL are all out of stock. Shawn Spring I did the same, dumped the 6P after I had preordered the Pixel XL on launch day. Boy am I glad I did. Stevie_Wonder Shooting RAW (DNG) and manual exposure. Google just told us what we are missing from the Google Camera app. Thank you Google, but we knew that already. Mihai Ionescu What Manual camera app do you reccomend? WittyPixel a post that I made a while back in the 6p XDA forums, enjoy! https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-6p/themes-apps/nexus-6p-manual-camera-recommendations-t3340090 Lizzie McVeigh Adobe's Light Room Camera. You get full control of settings... up to 0.7" of exposure. Random! We desperately need that app you've mentioned, with manual controls for exposure time, aperture and ISO. Scott Olsen There's plenty of them already. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.flavionet.android.camera.pro Mike Or just get any phone that isn't developed by Google. My name is…. the smart choice martesque Like say, the LG V20 camera app. Defenestratus Took this picture on my old Nexus 6P of my neighbor's house the other day while walking the pooch. Moon was right behind the light house. the picture is pretty grainy but still pretty impressive given how dark it was outside (even though it doesn't look like it in the picture, I think Google Photos messed with the settings a bit) https://goo.gl/photos/1VBuUKxRGC7Dutyh7 Rod URL not found Ahamid17 Its a shame I had to give up my 5X for an iPhone because of that boot loop issue other than that I really loved my 5X camera Ahamid17 I would love to see the process in which he combined that 64 and 32 frames to get that result and imagine in the future if your camera app could do that in app instead of doing it on photoshop Tauran This needs to be an automated processing trick on Google photos. HDR is great but people like me don't have time to process photos manually to look this great. WittyPixel Salty post... "This is a composite of 32 frames at 4-second exposure and ISO 1600, taken with the Nexus 6P" realizing google didn't unlock all the capabilities he builds an apps to do so. If google allowed apps to use the sensor to it's full capability then we could do the same and the camera would be truly amazing. Gjorgi Lazarovski I don't get what you're saying but the Camera2 API that's in Android since Lollipop allows this and is fully enabled on both phones. You just need the right app, like Manual Camera from the Play store for example. With a tripod and set of skills in Photoshop you're most likely to get the same results by yourself. Kyle Gospodnetich The Pixel and 6P camera drivers are limited to 2 second exposures max. There are many other phones from other manufacturers that can have much, much longer exposure times set via the Camera2 API. funky There is also a hack on xda to support longer exposures, I guess 4 sec WittyPixel future reference... link or it doesn't exist. and there is not one for the nexus 6p, fyi. WittyPixel camera 2 API does not allow that feature. bobinchicago Hey, my Nexus 6P would take great shots too if the battery life wasn't down to an hour and plunging down to 0 the moment I open the camera app. VAVAMk_2 Get a replacement battery dblock I honestly think even the 6P has a better camera than the S8+. I have only had the phone less than a week, but thus far it seems like the camera just isn't as good, back or front camera for that matter. And it may not be the sensors themselves, but perhaps the software. The Google Camera on the Nexus/Pixel devices is just too damn good. JohnyNoLegs Blind tests put the S8 on almost equal footing of the Pixel. It's all in the software. Hence why it takes so long to process images after you take them. Klugschwaetzer Mhh. I'm wondering why I see no star trails after 2 minutes. Stars should not be round, but elongated. Since they are quite round, it seems that this Mr. Kainz has adjusted for earth's motion somehow. But then the branches of the trees should be blurry. Very strange indeed. ChicagoPete I hope you've taken the last 12 minutes to read the source post for this article. Klugschwaetzer I have. Have you? 64 images with two second exposure each means that not counting an intervall between shots you look at the sky for over 128 seconds. The stars will have moved by that time making a virtual overexposure very difficult. Unless he somehow compensated for that. But I don't see how he could have done that - as I said before. Klugschwaetzer Just read the source article. Thanks for pointing that out. jwildman16 Two seconds, not minutes. NinoBr0wn I've given up hope for Google to update their camera app to something above a passing grade. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good strategy by Google to do night pictures. That minimizes the chance of getting halos in the Pixel pictures. whispy_snippet Haven't you already been completely burnt in a camera debate that forced you to leave the discussion without a reply? Why would you want to do it again? Mix I was like how in the heck can I do this with my Pixel!? ".....he built a simple camera app with manual control over exposure time" Dammit.

Google has sprinkled some new ingredients into its search engine in an effort to prevent bogus information and offensive suggestions from souring its results. Most of the changes announced Tuesday, April 25, 2017, are designed to reduce the chances that its influential search engine will highlight untrue stories about people and events, a phenomenon commonly referred to as “fake news.” Besides trying to block fake news, Google has reprogrammed a popular feature to omit derogatory search suggestions.

The announcement Tuesday reflects Google's confidence in a new screening system designed to reduce the chances that its influential search engine will highlight untrue stories about people and events, a phenomenon commonly referred to as "fake news." "We now think we can stay a step ahead of things," said Ben Gomes, Google's vice president of engineering for search. Autocomplete Besides taking steps to block fake news from appearing in its search results, Google also reprogrammed a popular feature that automatically tries to predict what a person is looking for as a search request as being typed. The tool, called "autocomplete," has been overhauled to omit derogatory suggestions, such as "are women evil," or recommendations that promote violence. Google also added a feedback option for users to report objectionable suggestions to a human. Why Google cares Google began attacking fake news in late December after several embarrassing examples of misleading information appeared near the top of its search engine. Among other things, Google's search engine pointed to a website that incorrectly reported then President-elect Donald Trump had won the popular vote, that President Obama was planning a coup and that the Holocaust never occurred during World War II. Only about 0.25 percent of Google's search results were being polluted with falsehoods, Gomes said. But that was still enough to threaten the integrity of the search engine. How they did it Google began revising the closely guarded algorithms that generate its search with the help of 10,000 people who rate the quality and reliability of the recommendations during tests. Google also rewrote its 140-page book of rating guidelines that help the quality-control evaluators make their assessments. Google as referee Fighting fake news can be tricky because in some cases what is viewed as being blatantly misleading by one person might be interpreted as being mostly true by another. If Google, Facebook or other companies trying to block false information err in their judgment calls, they risk being accused of censorship or playing favorites. But doing nothing to combat fake news would probably have caused even bigger headaches. But if too much misleading information appears, the damage could go beyond harm to its reputation for reliability. It could also spook risk-averse advertisers, who don't want their brands tied to content that can't be trusted, said Larry Chiagouris, a marketing professor at Pace University in New York.

Samantha Bryan gave a rare interview on Channel 5 documentary Soham Revisited: 15 Years On, which examined Huntley's murders of ten year old schoolgirls Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman. She was just 14 years old when she learned notorious murderer Huntley is her father, after a chance discovery while researching a school project on Google. But she doesn't blame her mum for the shocking discovery – instead thanking her for protecting her. Sam revealed her link to Huntley after her 18th birthday (Photo: ITN Productions) The picture of her mum and Huntley that Samantha discovered (Photo: Channel 5) "I think you did do the right thing by not telling me everything straight away because it would have been a lot harder for me to process and it probably – at 11, it would have confused me," said Samantha. "It made me realise, just how brave and strong you are, and how much I admire you as a person. It makes me proud to be your daughter." She also vowed Huntley will “never deserve” to be called her dad after she discovered her connection to the killer while researching a school project on Google. “If he was expecting to get some sort of message from me he’d be lucky to get one,” said Samantha on tonight's show. “He doesn’t even deserve to be known or called my biological father and he will never deserve to be called dad.” Huntley murdered two schoolgirls in 2002 (Photo: PA) Read More "If you spoil this for me I’ll kill you": Evil Soham murderer Ian Huntley threatened his ex when she told him she was pregnant Samantha explained how she discovered her father's identity while researching a school project. "I found out through school. We was doing the crime rates in Grimsby and Cleethorpes and – so that’s all I put into Google and the picture of my mum came up so I clicked on it which took me straight to the story," she recalled. "I was extremely upset, I didn’t really know what to think." "I wasn’t, angry at my mum for not telling me what he’d done because at that age I – I wouldn’t want my children to know that," said Sam.

Katie claimed in the Channel 5 documentary she suffered abuse at the hands of Huntley during their time together "There was one time where I’d burnt his dinner– and he said I was useless I couldn’t get anything right," she said. "He said to me that I’m making him eat that rubbish and tried to feed me cat food. He forced my head into it, he tried to get it in my mouth." Katie was 15 when she met Huntley (Photo: ITN Productions) Katie said she finally left Huntley after he punched her in the stomach at three months pregnant and she realised she had to get out in order to protect her child. She never intended to tell Samantha the identity of her father - until the Soham murders happened and Huntley's face and name were inescapable. Huntley was found guilty in December 2003 of murdering Holly and Jessica in the village of Soham, Cambridgeshire and given two life sentences. The girls had gone missing on the evening of August 4, 2002 after leaving a family barbecue to buy sweets. Their bodies were found two weeks later.

When Samantha was 11, Katie told her that her biological dad was a "nasty man" and she would never see him. Then when Samantha was 18, Katie gave her a box of clippings detailing Huntley's murderous past.

Nandita Mathur Google’s new translation capability will also be available to users on Google search and Maps. Photo: Bloomberg New Delhi: Google India announced a new set of products and features for Indian languages on Tuesday. Google Translate will use the company’s new Neural Machine Translation technology to translate between English and nine widely used Indian languages — Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Tamil, Telugu, Gujarati, Punjabi, Malayalam and Kannada. Neural translation offers a huge improvement over the old phrase-based system, translating full sentences at a time, instead of pieces of a sentence. Google also announced the extension of Neural Machine Translation to Chrome browser’s built-in Auto-Translate functionality , making full-page translations more accurate and easier to read. This will enable Indian language speakers to consume all of the web’s content in nine Indian languages with higher quality translations of everything from song lyrics to news articles to cricket discussions. The new translation capability will also be available to users on Google search and Maps. With this update, millions of reviews—from restaurants to cafes or hotels—will appear in the language selected by the users on their device in addition to the original language of the review. According to Rajan Anandan, vice-president, India & South East Asia, Google: “The most important aspect of making the web more useful and meaningful for all of India is to make India’s Internet more representative of the India we live in. India today has 234 million Indian language users who’re online, compared to 175 million English web users, we expect another 300 million Indian language users to come online in the next four years. With today’s launches, we’re taking a huge step forward to bring down the barriers that stop Indian language users to get more out of the Internet and also help the industry to solve for the needs of billion Indians.” The company also expanded the reach of the Gboard (new keyboard for Android launched in December 2016), offering transliteration support for Hindi, Bengali, Telugu, Marathi, Tamil, Urdu and Gujarati. Google is bringing dictionary functionality on Google Search for users, and will offer Hindi dictionary results from the popular Rajpal & Sons’ dictionary in collaboration with the Oxford University Press. This new experience will also support transliteration, allowing users to find meanings in Hindi using their existing keyboards. The company’s emphasis on Indian Language support is based on the findings of a joint report by Google and KPMG India, titled Indian Languages—Defining India’s Internet, which was released at an event in New Delhi. The report claims that Hindi will be the most used language on the Internet in India.

On Tuesday, the embattled ride-hailing company announced plans for an on-demand network of electric aircraft that can take off and land vertically, like a helicopter. It wants to test a network for such vehicles by 2020. The company said its partners in this Elevate initiative include real estate companies, aircraft manufacturers, electric vehicle charger makers and cities such as Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas. Jeff Holden, Uber’s chief product officer, said urban aviation “is a natural next step for Uber.” TRANSPORTATION Google autonomous cars to get real riders After almost a decade of research, Google’s autonomous car project is close to becoming a real service. Now known as Waymo, the Alphabet Inc. self-driving car unit is letting residents of Phoenix sign up to use its vehicles, a major step toward commercializing a technology that could one day upend transportation. For the service, Waymo is adding 500 customized Chrysler Pacifica minivans to its fleet. Waymo has already tested these vehicles, plus other makes and models, on public roads, but only with its employees and contractors inside. By opening the doors to the general public with a larger fleet, the company will get data on how people experience and use self-driving cars — and clues on ways to generate revenue from the technology. FOOD AND DRINK Chipotle discloses pay system problem Chipotle saw a key sales figure rise more than expected as it works to regain customers’ trust after a series of food scares, but likely lost at least a little ground again in disclosing a possible data security issue. The company said it believes it has stopped the unauthorized activity on the network that supports its payment system in restaurants. It said the investigation is focused on restaurant transactions between March 24 and April 18. A Chipotle representative said the company has notified card networks, which notifies issuing banks, which in turn notifies customers. Chipotle shares, which had been up more than 5 percent in aftermarket trading, gave back some of that gain. The chain said earlier that sales rose 17.8 percent at established locations for the three months ended March 31, following a 29.7 percent decline in the year-ago quarter. Sales at stores open at least 13 months had turned positive in December after dropping steeply in late 2015. The 13-month metric is a considered a key indicator because it strips out the volatility of newly opened and closed locations.

Samantha Bryan gave a rare interview on Channel 5 documentary Soham Revisited: 15 Years On, which examined Huntley's murders of ten year old schoolgirls Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman. She was just 14 years old when she learned notorious murderer Huntley is her father, after a chance discovery while researching a school project on Google. But she doesn't blame her mum for the shocking discovery – instead thanking her for protecting her. Sam revealed her link to Huntley after her 18th birthday (Photo: ITN Productions) The picture of her mum and Huntley that Samantha discovered (Photo: Channel 5) "I think you did do the right thing by not telling me everything straight away because it would have been a lot harder for me to process and it probably – at 11, it would have confused me," said Samantha. "It made me realise, just how brave and strong you are, and how much I admire you as a person. It makes me proud to be your daughter." She also vowed Huntley will “never deserve” to be called her dad after she discovered her connection to the killer while researching a school project on Google. “If he was expecting to get some sort of message from me he’d be lucky to get one,” said Samantha on tonight's show. “He doesn’t even deserve to be known or called my biological father and he will never deserve to be called dad.” Huntley murdered two schoolgirls in 2002 (Photo: PA) Read More "If you spoil this for me I’ll kill you": Evil Soham murderer Ian Huntley threatened his ex when she told him she was pregnant Samantha explained how she discovered her father's identity while researching a school project. "I found out through school. We was doing the crime rates in Grimsby and Cleethorpes and – so that’s all I put into Google and the picture of my mum came up so I clicked on it which took me straight to the story," she recalled. "I was extremely upset, I didn’t really know what to think." "I wasn’t, angry at my mum for not telling me what he’d done because at that age I – I wouldn’t want my children to know that," said Sam.

Katie claimed in the Channel 5 documentary she suffered abuse at the hands of Huntley during their time together "There was one time where I’d burnt his dinner– and he said I was useless I couldn’t get anything right," she said. "He said to me that I’m making him eat that rubbish and tried to feed me cat food. He forced my head into it, he tried to get it in my mouth." Katie was 15 when she met Huntley (Photo: ITN Productions) Katie said she finally left Huntley after he punched her in the stomach at three months pregnant and she realised she had to get out in order to protect her child. She never intended to tell Samantha the identity of her father - until the Soham murders happened and Huntley's face and name were inescapable. Huntley was found guilty in December 2003 of murdering Holly and Jessica in the village of Soham, Cambridgeshire and given two life sentences. The girls had gone missing on the evening of August 4, 2002 after leaving a family barbecue to buy sweets. Their bodies were found two weeks later.

When Samantha was 11, Katie told her that her biological dad was a "nasty man" and she would never see him. Then when Samantha was 18, Katie gave her a box of clippings detailing Huntley's murderous past.

Photo: AP tech Fiat Chrysler, Google begin offering rides in self-driving cars Today 06:15 am JST 0 Comments DETROIT Fiat Chrysler and Google for the first time will offer rides to the public in the self-driving automobiles they are building under an expanding partnership. The companies announced in the spring of last year that they would build 100 self-driving Chrysler Pacifica hybrids minivans. Those vehicles have been tested in Arizona, California and Michigan. Waymo, Google's self-driving care project, said Tuesday that it will allow hundreds of people in Phoenix to take rides in the vehicles so that it can get feedback on the experience. People can apply on Waymo's website. The company also said that it's expanding its fleet to 500 Pacifica hybrids. Waymo — created by Google in 2009 — has given rides to the public before in its hometown of Mountain View, California. In 2015, it let a blind man ride around Austin, Texas, in one of its completely self-driving pods. The Phoenix program will be much larger in scale, and it will be the first to use the Pacifica minivans. Others in the race to develop self-driving vehicles have been putting people in their cars since last fall. Uber has had self-driving Volvos on the road in Pittsburgh for some time. Boston startup nuTonomy is giving taxi rides to passengers in Singapore and Boston. In all cases, there is a backup driver behind the wheel. Waymo said it wants to learn where people want to go in a self-driving vehicle, how they communicate with it and what kinds of information and controls they want. Fiat Chrysler builds the Pacifica minivan in Windsor, Canada, just across the border from Detroit. It adds Waymo's self-driving software and hardware, including sensors and cameras, at a facility in Michigan. Fiat Chrysler's U.S. headquarters is in Auburn Hills, Michigan. "This collaboration is helping both companies learn how to bring self-driving cars to market, and realize the safety and mobility benefits of this technology," said Waymo chief John Krafcik in a company release. Our early riders will play an important role in shaping the way we bring self-driving technology into the world?_?through personal cars, public transportation, ride-hailing, logistics and more. Self-driving cars have the potential to reshape each and every one of these areas, transforming our lives and our cities by making them safer, more convenient and more accessible. Waymo has made clear that it intends to form partnerships with automakers and not build its own self-driving cars. It's also in talks with Honda Motor Co. about a potential collaboration. © Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

TECHNOLOGY How Does Pay-Per-Click Work (A Beginners Guide For Newbies) If you think that you know all there is to know about pay-per-click (PPC) based solely on its name, think again. There's much more involved in a successful PPC campaign than you might realize. By John Lincoln John Lincoln is co-founder and CEO of Ignite Visibility, a digital-marketing teacher at the University of California San Diego and an online-marketing consultant. @johnelincoln Co-founder and CEO, Ignite Visibility@johnelincoln WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement In this article, we'll go over the basics of PPC and give you some insight as to how the whole process works. What Is PPC? PPC lives up to its name. It's an online advertising strategy in which you only pay when people click on your ad. It's often considered the "go to" method for online advertisers because they don't want to pay just to display their ad. They want to pay only when people take action based on their ad. That seems like a much better way to invest in marketing, doesn't it? The Most Popular Types of PPC There are several ad networks that allow you to run PPC ads. Some of them are more popular than others. There's no doubt that Google AdWords is the most popular of the lot. That network allows you to run ads on the search results and on private websites. But Google isn't the only search engine in town. Bing has its own version of PPC that allows you to run ads on a variety of Microsoft search properties and partners. Facebook also offers a PPC advertising model. Many marketers love advertising on Facebook because it's relatively inexpensive. You can also run PPC display ads that are a great alternative the more boring, text-based ads that run on a lot of websites. Finally, you can also run a retargeting campaign with PPC. That's a great way to reel in customers who've already visited your website. How Much Does PPC Cost? How much does it cost to run a PPC campaign? It depends. For starters, PPC campaigns are based on keywords. Some keywords cost more than others. Why? Because they're in higher demand. If you want to run an ad with "car insurance" as the keyword, you can be sure that it's going to cost a lot more per click an ad with "St. Ignatius" as the keyword. That's because more advertisers are bidding for "car insurance" than "St. Ignatius." The cost of a PPC campaign is also determined by you. Most ad networks give you the option to set a budget so that your costs don't get out of control. For example, you might run a campaign with a budget of $100 per day. Once you've spent that much, the ad network will turn off your ads for the rest of the day so you don't spend any more. The Elements of PPC As we've seen, PPC is more involved than many marketers realize. In fact there are several components to a PPC campaign: The Campaign Itself - At the top of the hierarchy is the campaign itself. You might, for example, have an advertising campaign that's based on a holiday theme. The Ad Group - An ad group is a group of ads related to a campaign. For example, you might have one ad group related to gag gifts for a holiday party. You might have another group related to Christmas cards. Keywords - Your keywords should be relevant to your ad group. Google will use keyword relevance in determining ad placement (more on this in a bit). Ad Text - You'll want to run some catchy text in your ad that tempts people to click on it. It's usually best to enlist the aid of a professional copywriter when creating ad text. Landing Page - The landing page is where people "land" when they click on your ad. It should also be relevant to your keywords. How Does the Auction Work? Ad networks typically allow people to bid on a keywords in an open auction. But don't think that you know everything there is to know about bidding on keywords just because you've visited eBay a few times. Bidding for keywords is a bit more complicated. That's because your ad placement is determined, in part, by your bid. The other factor that goes into ad placement is the quality of the ad itself. Google determines the quality of your by evaluating its relevance to your keywords, your landing page relevance, and the ad's click-through rate. To determine your overall ad rank, you just multiply your bid by your quality score. For example, if you quality score is 10 and your bid is $1.00 than your rank is 10 (10 x 1). If that number is higher than the ad rank of other advertisers bidding on the same keyword, then your ad will appear on top. Keep in mind, though, the amount you pay is different than your bid. It's going to be lower. That's because Google calculates your payment as follows: it divides your quality score by the ad rank of the next highest bidder and then adds a penny. So if your quality score is 10 and the ad rank of the next highest bidder is 9, then you pay 91 cents (9/10 + .01). See? It's complicated. Hire a Pro If you take anything away from this article, take this: you shouldn't go it alone when it comes to PPC. There are just too many ways to lose money when you venture into online advertising without professional guidance. Locate a company (or hire a rock star employee) that can help you find the best ad network for your brand and work with you on ad copy, bidding strategies, and testing. Also, make sure to do plenty of competitive analysis before you start. You've invested a lot to build your business. Keep it profitable by working with a reputable PPC company when you want to advertise online. The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.

Google posts truly incredible night images captured by the Pixel and Nexus 6P Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/25 11:28am PDTApr 25, 2017 52 Plus 1 on G+ 362 Share on Facebook 96 Share on Twitter Total Shares510 Google News Nexus 6P Pixel Pixel XL Smartphone cameras have come a long way, but can you ever take images that rival a "real" camera? According to Google software engineer Florian Kainz, the answer is yes. Using a custom camera app and some post-capture editing , Kainz shows what the camera sensors in the Pixel and Nexus 6P can do in low light situations. Kainz says his little project was inspired by a chat with Google's Gcam team, which focuses on computational photography. The most visible Gcam contribution to Google's products is HDR+, which allows phones like the Pixel to take photos in dim lighting by combining as many as 10 burst shots. HDR+ isn't perfect, though. Sometimes there just isn't enough light to produce a good image. 64 4-second exposures, shot with Nexus 6P With long exposures and lots of individual images, Kainz reasoned it should be possible to get much better photos out of a smartphone's tiny camera sensor. To test this, he built a simple camera app with manual control over exposure time, ISO, and focus distance. The image at the top of the Point Reyes Lighthouse at night was Kainz's first test. This is a composite of 32 frames at 4-second exposure and ISO 1600, taken with the Nexus 6P. He also covered the lens and captured 32 completely black frames. The RAW image files were exported to Photoshop, where the mean of all 32 photos was computed, then the mean of the 32 black frames was subtracted. Below you can see what one of the individual HDR+ photos looked like. Impressive, no? A single 6P HDR+ frame Kainz did more tests with a variety of editing tricks, which you can read about in the full post. Below are some of the photos taken with the Pixel, but that phone only supports maximum 2-second exposures. Kainz speculates that a longer exposures could allow even better low-light photos on smartphones, assuming the subject is not moving and you have a tripod. Amusingly, the Pixel photos were taken in June and July last year, long before the phone was announced. 64 2-second exposures, shot with Google Pixel Many of the editing tweaks used to produce these images could be automated, too. You could imagine an app for Android or a mode in the camera that does most of this for you. Of course, the processing time for a few dozen RAW files would be rather lengthy on a phone. Maybe it could be built into Google Photos? If you want to see more photos from Kainz's experiments, there's a Google Photos album. 64 2-second exposures, shot with Pixel Source: Google Research Tags camera Google google research hdr nexus 6p photography pixel research subscribe ...

Random! Also, fucking skills of whoever is doing all the post processing in these pics. This ain't special about the Pixel and 6P after all, this post processing algorithm could be applied to any phone's pics. madcanada Any pics. Including a DSLR and night sky shots. Gonna try this weekend. shutUface 6p hdr post processing is really good. Throw the photos in snapseed for a little effect. Ocepi https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/63d92d20e4febf4677fb9a1dbbdd2230d3563bf5f95c0c065225af6ddf0baf25.jpg Milton P. This, I need this in my life!!! I'm dying for long exposure option in my phone. ChronoReverse The Htc 10 hardware can do stuff like this already. Here's a 900 second exposure: https://www.flickr.com/photos/maik_reifschneider/29419144492/ HebeGuess same sensors IMX377 as 5X/6P, different optics (with OIS). Pink tint at lower right corner was IR bleed from Laser Autofocus. James Doyle 64 pictures was all they could take before the 6P immediately shut down, probably while the battery read 35%. Snark aside, at this point I think maybe it's too soon to automate something like this on the phone itself, but this would be an amazing thing that Google Photos's AI could automate for us. David Ruddock Exactly. If you could use a stabilizer/tripod and upload the photos to the cloud. That would be nuts. James Doyle I'm almost there for just HDR+. A half dozen HDR+ images all trying to process brings my phone to a crawl, meaning I can't take any more pictures. Let's calm down the processing until I've stopped taking pics, or offload the work to the cloud. jonzey231 Yep. Totally agree with this statement. Once you've got a pretty dark photo trying to process or two decent images trying to process at once, the phone is basically a brick for the next 30 seconds. TSS TS 'The Cloud' doesn't work that way - Cloud based technologies fall under xaaS (IaaS/SaaS/DaaS) - The most common application is DaaS - Which is the only cloud space Google offers to residential consumers. Even if Google created an IaaS product scope, the limitations of current cell protocols would never allow 'processing' to be handed off to anything. Process threads are computed locally. There is nobody on this planet that has figured out how to parse thread computation over ANY WAN/LAN/Network to a central CPU farm to work out xyz process. The concept would be incredibly inefficient anyways. As the CPU processing the threads would have to process the inbound transaction, process the job, then redistribute back to the client. It would being doing 3-10x the work to say nothing have the transaction congestion, and security issues. Reference : Me, i'm a Sys Engineer/Admin. Toodles. Stuart Anderson His point is they could delay and/or limit the HDR+ work until after he's done taking pictures. And post processing like this doesn't need to be real time anyway. Jake Ashton lol. TSS TS got owned! leave it to the "experts" to think inside the box and just tell people what they can't do. toodles EH101 I think you're misunderstanding. What he means is take the 64 pictures (or 3 for regular HDR), let them all get uploaded as you normally would when you hit wifi, then let Google Photos online do the work to make the final picture. Not let the 'cloud' process something that stays on the device in real time. Google already does this to an extent, letting Google Photos 'read' the images and group them by face etc. Sean Buckman I'm using google pixel and I just keep shooting with no lag. It takes a bit(around 5-10 seconds) after taking the pictures to process the HDR+ but it doesn't slow the phone down. Matt I wonder how long it would take to upload 64 RAW files to the cloud... whispy_snippet With Australia's internet speeds I estimate 231 years and six days. Winston What are you talking about? I was there last year and loved the speeds I could get on LTE. But then again I was on Telstra... whispy_snippet I'm on Telstra too but I wasn't referring to cellular data speeds.

I wouldn't mind the wait if the phone could just do it fo me though. 7-down And yet, Google Camera app will be dry as bones with basic features. JohnyNoLegs It's like Google don't care about features. Like they think people will be happy with the most basic of applications. 2kool4skool ✓ⱽᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵇʸ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Google dumbed-down their apps to be as simple and as barebone as possible because apparently there are people that are scared with having options. These are the same people that call any phone or app that offers more than basic features as "gimmicks". JohnyNoLegs Completely agree. For some reason, there has always been a market for this. Feels to me it's for people who either don't do that much on their phone, or like buying third party apps for some reason. Tom Harman While I like my pixel, I'll stick to my D800e for 99% of my photos. madcanada Lol, I have a Canon 6D and I stick to Nexus 6P for 99% of my photos :D Patrick Comparing a 6D and a D800e is like comparing a Polaroid to a Leica. They're different tools for much different uses. That being said, I'm surprised that the Pixel wouldn't take over for the d800e... The simplicity, man! I don't shoot my d800 for anything but photo shoots now because the Pixel is too easy to get great shots and I don't have to spend hours in post. catalysto In the context of comparing to a smartphone, they are practically the same. Trent It's impressive, of course. But to suggest that even the best software will help a Pixel rival a DSLR is comedic. Good enough for most, they are, but put them up on a big screen next to similar shots from even a Nikon D3300 and the lack of pixels (amongst other things) will show which is better. There's also the small matter of all that editing hassle. Naturally, I shoot RAW with my DSLR, but a little time in Lightroom is generally all that's needed to make a shot pop. I appreciate that I'm being a little over-the-top in my condemnation, image quality/rivaling "real" cameras is about more than just how good something looks on a smartphone display. It's about being able to zoom in without a major loss of quality and casting the image to a TV and it not looking bad at that size. I do like my Pixel very much and it's great for casual shots. A DSLR replacement it is not, however. David Ruddock I think this is mostly about the power of light-gathering and composite HDR even when in use even with a tiny sensor. It bodes well for the future of algorithmic photography if nothing else - as sensors get better and algorithms do, too, we can keep pushing the limits of these already impressive methods. This example just takes it to an extreme as a showcase. madcanada This article is about the algorithm. You can apply the same process to a DSLR image making night sky shots even better. OhYeah! This is basicly only due to the Photo stacking technique. You can tell from the single image that each photo is pretty terrible but once you median stack the photos it can average out all the noise. You could create a photo that looked pretty great from a Galaxy S 3 if you really wanted to. madcanada Yes, that's what I said. OhYeah! Yep you kind of did in a different way. Good job, you can recognize similarities! TechGuy22 yet no one can buy the pixel thank god i was able to sell my 6p for 500 bucks and bought the xl rjyanj "no one can buy the pixel" "i bought the xl" hmm.

Stevie_Wonder Shooting RAW (DNG) and manual exposure. Google just told us what we are missing from the Google Camera app. Thank you Google, but we knew that already. Mihai Ionescu What Manual camera app do you reccomend?

Moon was right behind the light house. the picture is pretty grainy but still pretty impressive given how dark it was outside (even though it doesn't look like it in the picture, I think Google Photos messed with the settings a bit) https://goo.gl/photos/1VBuUKxRGC7Dutyh7 Rod URL not found Ahamid17 Its a shame I had to give up my 5X for an iPhone because of that boot loop issue other than that I really loved my 5X camera Ahamid17 I would love to see the process in which he combined that 64 and 32 frames to get that result and imagine in the future if your camera app could do that in app instead of doing it on photoshop Tauran This needs to be an automated processing trick on Google photos. HDR is great but people like me don't have time to process photos manually to look this great. WittyPixel Salty post... "This is a composite of 32 frames at 4-second exposure and ISO 1600, taken with the Nexus 6P" realizing google didn't unlock all the capabilities he builds an apps to do so. If google allowed apps to use the sensor to it's full capability then we could do the same and the camera would be truly amazing. Gjorgi Lazarovski I don't get what you're saying but the Camera2 API that's in Android since Lollipop allows this and is fully enabled on both phones. You just need the right app, like Manual Camera from the Play store for example. With a tripod and set of skills in Photoshop you're most likely to get the same results by yourself. Kyle Gospodnetich The Pixel and 6P camera drivers are limited to 2 second exposures max. There are many other phones from other manufacturers that can have much, much longer exposure times set via the Camera2 API. funky There is also a hack on xda to support longer exposures, I guess 4 sec WittyPixel future reference... link or it doesn't exist. and there is not one for the nexus 6p, fyi. WittyPixel camera 2 API does not allow that feature. bobinchicago Hey, my Nexus 6P would take great shots too if the battery life wasn't down to an hour and plunging down to 0 the moment I open the camera app. VAVAMk_2 Get a replacement battery dblock I honestly think even the 6P has a better camera than the S8+. I have only had the phone less than a week, but thus far it seems like the camera just isn't as good, back or front camera for that matter. And it may not be the sensors themselves, but perhaps the software. The Google Camera on the Nexus/Pixel devices is just too damn good. JohnyNoLegs Blind tests put the S8 on almost equal footing of the Pixel. It's all in the software. Hence why it takes so long to process images after you take them. Klugschwaetzer Mhh. I'm wondering why I see no star trails after 2 minutes. Stars should not be round, but elongated. Since they are quite round, it seems that this Mr. Kainz has adjusted for earth's motion somehow. But then the branches of the trees should be blurry. Very strange indeed. ChicagoPete I hope you've taken the last 12 minutes to read the source post for this article. Klugschwaetzer I have. Have you? 64 images with two second exposure each means that not counting an intervall between shots you look at the sky for over 128 seconds. The stars will have moved by that time making a virtual overexposure very difficult. Unless he somehow compensated for that. But I don't see how he could have done that - as I said before. Klugschwaetzer Just read the source article. Thanks for pointing that out. jwildman16 Two seconds, not minutes. NinoBr0wn I've given up hope for Google to update their camera app to something above a passing grade. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good strategy by Google to do night pictures. That minimizes the chance of getting halos in the Pixel pictures. whispy_snippet Haven't you already been completely burnt in a camera debate that forced you to leave the discussion without a reply?

The Uber flying taxi would be a small, electric aircraft, that would have vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) technology. There are hubs for takeoffs and landing strips being developed in Texas and Dubai, where the company plans to first deploy the taxis. Uber plans to give passengers flights as part of The World Expo 2020 in Dubai. Chief Product Officer Jeff Holden Media: Wibbitz Jeff Holden, Uber’s chief product officer, hates the phrase “flying cars.” But he took to a Dallas stage on Tuesday to announce that Uber will offer a flying-car taxi service in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and Dubai by 2020 — something he said “fits cleanly into our mission” and Uber’s focus on “big bold bets.” “It’s natural for Uber to turn its eyes to the air: push a button, get a flight,” he said to an audience of several hundred people gathered for a three-day summit called Uber Elevate. “Urban aviation can replace long-distance commutes.” Uber is among a bevy of well-funded companies pursuing the sci-fi vision of flying cars. Google co-founder Larry Page has a Mountain View startup called Kitty Hawk led by Sebastian Thrun, who launched Google’s self-driving efforts. French aerospace giant Airbus is working on the idea, as are several smaller players.

Rather than creating its own flying machines, it wants to partner with other companies, both for the aircraft and the infrastructure. What Uber brings to the party is its 60 million riders, who one day could see an option to hit “Uber Elevate” in their ride-hailing app to call a drone. Somewhat ironically, Holden said Uber also would bring its expertise on working with government and communities, because it already has relationships with regulatory authorities. That seemed to ignore the company’s history of clashing with regulators worldwide. For that matter, plenty of observers noted that Uber may be relieved to have a chance to focus on futuristic visions instead of the present controversies engulfing it, such as a lawsuit over its self-driving car project and accusations of toxic workplace culture and sexism. A judge ruled Tuesday that Anthony Levandowski, head of Uber’s self-driving effort, must testify in the lawsuit filed by Waymo. Uber has inked deals with five companies working on aircraft development: Aurora Flight Sciences, Pipistrel, Bell Helicopter, Embraer and Mooney. It also has agreements with real estate companies — Texas’ Hillwood Properties and Dubai Holdings — to start scouting places for “vertiports;” Holden said it’s identified four sites in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. And Chargepoint, the largest operator of electric-vehicle charging stations, will figure out how to top off the batteries. TOP BUSINESS VIDEOS: Story continues below | Business news first: Sign in for newsletters The proposed vehicles look more like drones than cars. Technically they are electric VTOLs (vertical takeoff and landing, pronounced vee-toll). They fly themselves straight up into the air like a helicopter — meaning they can more easily take to the skies from dense urban environments — but then fly forward like a small aircraft. Uber looked into actual helicopters for local transit but rejected them as too expensive, noisy, fuel-consuming and otherwise impractical, Holden said. In October, Holden published a 99-page white paper outlining Uber’s vision of air transit, including vehicles that would travel 100 to 150 mph, eventually making it cheap enough for the masses to use as daily transport. “Just like artificial intelligence, flying cars have been promised for decades but are arriving now,” he said on Tuesday. Plenty of big obstacles remain, such as creating a new air traffic control system and persuading regulators, experts said. The idea that the VTOLs may be autonomous is actually a plus, said Karl Bauer, executive publisher of Kelley Blue Book and Auto Trader. “Normally it requires years of training to learn to fly. But if you’ve got computer-controlled flying devices that are all talking to each other, the average Joe can just tell it where to go and it flies itself.” How realistic is Uber’s projection of sky taxis by 2020? It wouldn’t be the first tech company to plant a stake in the ground, er, air, with an overambitious timetable, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing, some experts said. “I love that Uber’s a big cheerleader in this space,” said Missy Cummings, director of Duke University’s Humans and Autonomy Laboratory and a NASA researcher. “It’s great that they’re trying to generate excitement. But the big hurdles are safety and certification. We’re not ready for you to jump in your own drone and hop over to Oakland.” Carolyn Said is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars TRANSPORTATION Guest Why highways should isolate self-driving cars in special smart lanes Umberto Malesci, Fluidmesh@umbertomalesci April 25, 2017 2:10 PM Image Credit: Subaru The race is on. Tech giants like Google, Tesla and most car makers — from Toyota to Ford and Volvo — are betting billions to get intelligent self-driving cars on the road as soon as possible. Earlier this month, Apple became the 30th company to be granted permission to test autonomous vehicles on California by the state’s DMV. Even Amazon is reported to have created a team to understand how to best leverage the upcoming revolution. And Waymo (sister company of Google) has started testing its fleet in Phoenix. But the road to autonomy is long, winding, and dangerous. Hours after being deployed in San Francisco in December, Uber’s autonomous cars were caught running a red light. Last year in Florida, a Tesla driver died in a crash when the car, on autopilot, confused a truck making a turn for an overhead road sign. “I don’t see the ideal of complete automation coming anytime soon,” Christopher Hart, former president of the National Transportation Safety Board, said recently. “There’s no software designer in the world that’s ever going to be smart enough to anticipate all the potential circumstances… the dog that runs out into the street, the person who runs up the street, the bicyclist, the policeman or the construction worker,” he said. So are we stuck with only humans as drivers for years to come? I don’t think so. But if we want to take our hands off the wheel anytime soon, we should stop focusing exclusively on the car. Instead, we should build smart lanes in highways dedicated exclusively to self-driving cars, far from any erratic human behavior. Here’s how it would work. First off, we should zero in on a stretch of highway already equipped with intelligent sensors and road signs. We should then cordon off one lane with guard rail and make it accessible only to vehicles with the required technology (360° sensors, radar, vehicle-to-vehicle radio, automated steering, adaptive cruise control), through something like an E-ZPass toll booth. As vehicles enter and exit the lane at designated checkpoints, the system would assign each car a slot in the “platoon.” The convoy would cruise safely at high speed, each vehicle “tailgating” the next. Through on-board radios, each car and highway sensor would be a part of the same moving network, routing around obstacles and becoming aware of disruptions far ahead of time. Cars would save fuel (only the platoon leader would face headwinds), and drivers — or rather, passengers — could sit back and relax. The technology is already there. Protocols allowing cars to wirelessly communicate with each other (V2V) and with infrastructure (V2I) will soon be mandatory for all new vehicles, and WaVe, a technology similar to Wi-Fi, will soon be embedded in traffic lights, stop signs, and work zones, allowing two-way communication between cars and infrastructure. The idea of laying out vehicles in platoons is also not new: Swedish truckmaker Scania announced recently it will deploy autonomous truck platoons along a route in Singapore, while three Mercedes trucks platooned for 375 miles from Stuttgart to Rotterdam. Tech companies often have little patience for working with regulators: They like to build, ship, test, and iterate, pushing legal boundaries where needed, like Uber is currently doing. But tech slogans like “move fast and break things” work a lot better with social networking apps than with the physical world, where the breakable things are humans. Intelligence is proportional to the scope of the application, and city roads contain infinite variables. They are best navigated by highly adaptive (if easily distracted) brains, not machines that can only handle predicted scenarios. Today’s intelligent cars will not be able to handle urban roads and unpredictable humans for years to come. But they could safely self-drive for hundreds of miles on smart highway lanes starting today, creating a crucial stepping stone for broader adoption in less controlled scenarios. So how much would this cost? A useful comparison might be with toll lanes: Depending on complexity and length, new toll lanes can cost from a few hundred million to several billion dollars, often financed through joint public-private partnerships. That might seem like a lot — until we look at the economic impact automated vehicles will have on the U.S. economy, which University of Texas engineers have estimated at $1.2 trillion. When a company like Intel spends $15.3 billion in one acquisition to achieve leadership in the connected car industry, it’s hard to see why U.S. federal and local governments could not spend a fraction of that to help build the future of transportation. Should President Trump fulfill his promise to allocate $1 trillion to improving U.S. infrastructure, there might even be a budget for it.

With these changes users should see less in the way of so-called "fake news" and other non-factual content (excluding searches for that material), and more accurate and relevant information pertaining to their search. The biggest user-facing change you are likely to see is probably the new feedback link. It allows users to tag snippets —the short bits of text you might see that directly answer questions posed in a search —or autocomplete results as being accurate, inaccurate, offensive, or just disliked. There's no telling yet exactly how Google may or may not use the data collected via reports, but at a minimum it may go some way to prevent a few of the problems they've seen. I know in the past I've seen snippets come up that are either entirely incorrect or totally unrelated to a search. Hopefully this doesn't just present a new vector for further rank manipulation in autocomplete, though. The changes to search sorting are pretty straightforward. Google's had some problems in the past with sites manipulating how they appear on results. After all, anything that's governed by a set of rules can be gamed using those rules. Even without that Google's had some problems with factually inaccurate results appearing on top of results. They'll be making new changes to ranking to avoid that sort of thing in the future, and they're redoubling their efforts with Google's human oversight in determining quality of results. Their content policy has been updated with the details, and their educational portal on how their Search works has also been changed. Until we see how searches are changed there's no way to know if the new tools might open another means for manipulation of results. While it's possible some might use it as a means of censorship or calumny, hopefully the system is robust enough to resist that type of manipulation. Either way, we shall see.

Luciano Damn, MJ was spot on. He said you're coming and here you are! F4LL0U7 Well yesterday's March For Science post is a pretty good indication of how this comment section is about to play out... M. Luciano I must have missed it - wtf is controversial about supporting science? F4LL0U7 A lot, apparently! Check it out. http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/04/24/went-protest-app/#comment-3271548575 Sir_Brizz I think it's wrong to simplify both the "March for Science" and whatever happened in that comments section to "supporting science". Most people would agree with "supporting science" but it is rarely that simple. If you don't understand what problem a reasonably intelligent person would have had with the march or that post, then that probably warrants further investigation on your part to form your own opinions. M. Luciano I was surprised to hear that there was any controversy over the march for science. Science seems like one of the most uncontroversial things one could "march" for. The article didn't mention any controversy, unless people creating an app to collect data at protests is controversial, but then almost every app on every platform would be controversial. Nicholas Conrad It wasn't a march for science, it was just called a march for science. It was a march in support of a particular set of policy prescriptions. Anyone who really supports science would know that science can't be in favor of one policy or another, it can only inform the discussion of costs and benefits of varying policies which then have to be weighed. M. Luciano Furthermore, a Google search for "March for Science Controversy" turns up no controversy. Just a bunch of articles explaining who and what is going on. Is there an actual controversy? People supporting the scientific method and it's application to the challenges of our current world and society... that's not controversial. Nicholas Conrad Clearly a media conspiracy; is mj lamestream? MJ The first of the manipulated BLOCKED! This is NOT a free speech issue so I would suggest a First Amendment 101 class. cooldude5500 Man I loved to search something weird for the predictions so that I could see the most outrageous thing that people were searching for.

They're 1) Not censoring anything and 2) Trying to promote accuracy in search results Vivek Rameses If I were to use Google at least I won't see any CNN, Fox news and the likes. That would be a plus. rebretz000 I think the fact that a tool like this is needed is biggest problem. I can't believe that there are persons out there so gullible that they will believe almost anything posted online. Averix A lot of people don't cross check articles and only read headlines. Sites that base their existence off of ad revenue by getting people into a "click hole" of fake news stories have the psychology of morons figured out. David Warthen We must get rid of the fake news so you can be inundated with all the real news that's completely made up. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ As long as I can filter out /r/the_donald I think that will take care of the majority of it. F4LL0U7 Heads up, a handful of users you've never seen on AP before are about to rain their barely literate rantings upon you. As an example, check out the March For Science post from yesterday. A Person People who attend science marches only push their belief in science when it suits their interests, not when it comes to male is male and female is female. M. Luciano Did that make sense when you wrote it? A Person Yes, it makes sense. M. Luciano What exactly is the scientific understanding of the relationships between sex and gender? We could try sociological, biological and psychological. Let us know when you're ready to read up on the hundreds of peer reviewed studies and provide an analysis. F4LL0U7 People who say things like that have likely never had a child, relative, or friend who turned out to be trans. And even if you haven't, why not try having a little empathy? Life might be more enjoyable, and you might be less angry at things that have absolutely no impact on you whatsoever. A Person That is very selfish of you to enforce others believe or acknowledge something simply because you yourself have experienced. If you have a friend, child, or relative that thinks they should have been the opposite sex, and you didn't attempt to get them psychiatric help, then you dropped the ball. F4LL0U7 I'm sure I should just block you and end this waste of time, but I'll ask anyway: do you think homosexuals need psychiatric help as well, or do you think that's a valid way for a person to live their life? A Person I'm sorry, do all homosexuals think you can switch back and forth between male or female, or whatever other gender you want to make up? If that is the case, then we can talk. I see "other person typing"... but sorry, I'm out... you people are batsh!t crazy. fijisiv Dude keep it up. I have never seen somebody so proud of their ignorance! Is it painful to watch? Is it sad? Is it humorous? Yes. F4LL0U7 Really? Never? (Had to bring it all back around to Devin's OP) https://az616578.vo.msecnd.net/files/responsive/embedded/any/desktop/2016/07/30/636055042891058227364682665_2.jpg Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Kudos to you and @disqus_DIvkrvAJjQ:disqus for attempting to educate @disqus_abcdefg:disqus, but sadly it seems they would rather hide in their little hole and pretend the world is black and white. F4LL0U7 You'd have to take a survey. But I would bet that most of them would be open to modern science, empathy, and leaving people the hell alone. That question was just a litmus test for your level of tolerance to other humans that may or may not fall into your perfect worldview. Sir_Brizz I'll vote for leaving people alone, although that is something that is rarely afforded to others. Nathan Walters You're the one refusing to acknowledge empirical evidence and human experience. Pot, meet kettle. MJ Holy Crap! I could have sworn that I BLOCKED (fixed) you long ago. Dude, stop with your endless ignorant comments. You have never said anything resembling intelligence on any subject here. Are people really this dumb or are most of them actually just trolls? Impossible to tell or know I guess... F4LL0U7 If you're out, does that mean you're not coming back, and I don't have to bother blocking you? Nathan Walters Wait, do you even know what science has to say about issues of biological sex? I'm guessing not. A Person Science says there are two genders, not Facebook's 58... or whatever count they're up to now. F4LL0U7 Sure, if the most recent science book you've read is the bible. A Person LOL... I haven't said anything about the bible. You're a guy or a girl and whatever logic you want to make up in order to twist two genders into 50+... well, let me get my popcorn. M. Luciano This is just as false as it was 4 minutes ago. Most people are a guy or a girl or both, but some are neither. F4LL0U7 I'll refer you to @disqus_DIvkrvAJjQ:disqus's post above, since they've already done the research, and I have to get back to work. M. Luciano You're wrong. "Science" holds 8 known sexes and three known genders. The sexes are X0, XX, XY, ZZ, ZW, WW, Hermaphrodite and asexual. The genders are male, female and neuter. This does not include chromosomal anomalies, such as XXY, XXYY, X and XXX. A Person lol... This is like if I were to argue that "tires can only be round", so your argument becomes "round isn't the only shape". M. Luciano No, it's as if you said, "people are male or female" and then I stated that the scientific understanding is that people are one of eight sexes and one of three genders. Because that's what actually happened. So you were incorrect because you were ignorant of the actual information available to you, now that you have it, you can learn. A Person Dude, I brought up gender and you brought up sex. Why do SJWs like yourself feel it necessary to complicate things as much as possible? M. Luciano You used them interchangeably with Nathan Walters, so figured you wanted to know that they're different. But even if you want to stick to gender only, there are 3, not 2. A Person I didn't use them interchangeably. I brought up gender. He then brought up sex. I didn't bring up sex. This is ridiculous. M. Luciano He brought up sex, you then referred to it as gender ... either way, 3 > 2. And either way, it has absolutely nothing to do with the overall topic of search results. F4LL0U7 The world is complicated, dude. And if something as simple as rethinking your pronouns can make life a little less complicated for people who are having a hard enough time as it is, then why not do it? In your mind, is being a Social Justice Warrior a bad thing? Seems like fighting for social justice is something to be proud of. F4LL0U7 More accurately, it's as if you said "tires are the only things that allow vehicles to move" and then @disqus_DIvkrvAJjQ:disqus cited tank treads, skis, wings, and propellors as other examples. A Person You're right, he/she/ze/it/them/they sounds even crazier when you put it that way. F4LL0U7 Maybe this concept wouldn't be so difficult for you if you spoke another language. Most other languages besides English have gender-neutral pronouns. If English did, then maybe you wouldn't be so offended by having to consider someone's gender identity before referring to them. Nathan Walters There aren't even only 2 sexes, why should the existence of more genders come as any surprise? Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a1ca661e6cd51072403c87d1161ea33d1aa68181de414832321558ead5d02819.jpg Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8f111e2cbfab6a1ab9e37e4dcb1b4e74b67793df6767debf1233b63590f83b15.jpg F4LL0U7 It's funny because 1) you think I'm a Democrat, and 2) you are hours late to this discussion and are making the same exact mistake as @disqus_abcdefg:disqus. kr3000 Excellent, a right wing news blocker. Because diversity of thought is like fascist and stuff. C Lo What could possibly go wrong... Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Bahahahahaha! As if I trust Google. I tried this myself with Google vs. Duckduckgo, searching for "Hillary Clinton is a". The results for Google have changed slightly, but they're still flattering. Duckduckgo still suggests criminal, liar, crook, murderer, etc. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/50818a751a00330950eceeca37a2b4d6b8f74ee8691ca9854e4ade9962a6264e.jpg F4LL0U7 Try that with any person in Google and you'll see the same discrepancy. Google already explained this (several months ago, welcome to the party!). They don't associate people's names with negative words in autocomplete. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ That's funny, because I get "Donald Trump is a" cheeto, dinosaur, democrat (now THAT is an insult) on Google. In fact, I get a lot of insulting suggestions for other people. "Bill O'Reilly is a" wife beater? So your explanation does not pass the smell test. F4LL0U7 You won't get suggestions about Trump being a liar (despite video evidence) or a crook (despite him settling out of court for defrauding attendees of his "university"). Google simply does not suggest terms like that. Here's an idea -- Google it. It was in the news almost a year ago. Doby Gillis Seems you need to look up safe space since you're acting like a special, little, snowflake. Bruce Wayne Google is notoriously liberal so it's no surprise that they suppress negative comments about a liberal former presidential candidate and boost negative comments about a Republican president. I just looked up "Hillary Clinton is a..." and I got democrat, war hawk, hologram and hero. I did the same for Trump and got dinosaur, cheeto, gemini etc. And Google expects us to trust them with filtering for "fake news". HA! Scott Will the Google App get search tools?? D.Smithee How about they combat the absolute deluge of fake reviews in the Play Store. Geezus.

Waymo, Google's self-driving car project, said today it's adding 500 Chrysler Pacifica hybrid minivans to its self- driving vehicle fleet. It will allow hundreds of people in the Phoenix area to take rides in the vehicles so it can get feedback on the experience. Phoenix-area residents could apply on Waymo's website starting today. The vehicles will also pick up riders in Chandler, Tempe, Mesa and Gilbert, Waymo said. All of the vehicles will have Waymo backup drivers who can take over in an emergency. Fiat Chrysler and Waymo have been partners since last spring, when they announced they would build 100 self-driving Pacifica hybrids minivans. Those vehicles were delivered to Waymo in December. The companies have been testing the vehicles in Arizona, California and Michigan. Waymo began offering a small number of public rides in Arizona two months ago before deciding to expand the program, a spokesman said. Waymo - created by Google in 2009 - has given rides to the public before in its hometown of Mountain View, California. In 2015, it let a blind man ride around Austin, Texas, in one of its completely self-driving pods. The Phoenix program will be much larger in scale, and it will be the first to use the Pacifica minivans. Waymo isn't the first to put regular passengers in self- driving cars in the race to develop the technology. Ride- hailing company Uber has had self-driving Volvos on the road in Pittsburgh since last fall. Boston startup nuTonomy is giving taxi rides to passengers in Singapore and Boston. In all cases, there is a backup driver behind the wheel. Waymo said it wants to learn where people want to go in a self-driving vehicle, how they communicate with it and what kinds of information and controls they want. Fiat Chrysler builds the Pacifica minivan in Windsor, Canada, just across the border from Detroit. It adds Waymo's self-driving software and hardware, including sensors and cameras, at a facility in Michigan. Fiat Chrysler's US headquarters is in Auburn Hills, Michigan.

(Image courtesy of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles) VIEW PHOTO GALLERY5 photos AA DETROIT (AP) —  Fiat Chrysler and Google for the first time will offer rides to the public in the self-driving vehicles they are building under an expanding partnership. Waymo, Google's self-driving car project, said Tuesday it's adding 500 Chrysler Pacifica hybrid minivans to its self-driving vehicle fleet. It will allow hundreds of people in the Phoenix area to take rides in the vehicles so it can get feedback on the experience. Phoenix-area residents could apply on Waymo's website starting Tuesday. The vehicles will also pick up riders in Chandler, Tempe, Mesa and Gilbert, Waymo said. All of the vehicles will have Waymo backup drivers who can take over in an emergency. Fiat Chrysler and Waymo have been partners since last spring, when they announced they would build 100 self-driving Pacifica hybrids minivans. Those vehicles were delivered to Waymo in December. The companies have been testing the vehicles in Arizona, California and Michigan. Waymo began offering a small number of public rides in Arizona two months ago before deciding to expand the program, a spokesman said.

"This collaboration is helping both companies learn how to bring self-driving cars to market, and realize the safety and mobility benefits of this technology," said Waymo chief John Krafcik in a company release. Michelle Krebs, an executive analyst for the car shopping site Autotrader, says studies have shown that a majority of Americans are still reluctant to ride in a fully self-driving car. Opening Waymo's vehicles to the public will help build riders' confidence, she said. "The key to acceptance is exposure and education," she said. Ultimately, Waymo says, self-driving cars could prevent many of the 1.2 million deaths that occur on worldwide roads each year. Waymo has made clear that it intends to form partnerships with automakers and not build its own self-driving cars. It's also in talks with Honda Motor Co. about a potential collaboration. close Trending 1   Police warn of Lowe's coupon scam on Facebook 2   Deadly crash investigation underway in Bethlehem 3   Police investigating connection between 2 robberies overnight 4   Victim of deadly Schenectady fire identified 5   Mike Rowe blasts Nordstrom for selling $425 'fake mud' jeans DON'T MISS OUT Stay Connected with WRGB Like Follow © 2016 Sinclair Broadcast Group TermsPrivacyFCC InfoEEO News In Pictures Perp Patrol: Wanted gallery Police pick up adorable intruders: A pair of pygmy goats Woman charged in Troy stabbing Mike Rowe blasts Nordstrom for selling $425 'fake mud' jeans ShareTweet × Trending 1 Police warn of Lowe's coupon scam on Facebook 2 Deadly crash investigation underway in Bethlehem 3 Police investigating connection between 2 robberies overnight 4 Victim of deadly Schenectady fire identified 5 Mike Rowe blasts Nordstrom for selling $425 'fake mud' jeans 6 Day 6: Mother of 8-year-old killed in boat crash takes stand 7 Paul McCartney adds tour dates for New Jersey, New York 8 Mom, baby safe after weekend Thruway birth 9 Mental health experts urge Senate to ban conversion therapy 10 Day 7: Testimony continues in deadly Lake George boat crash trial
News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Google to Curb ‘Fake News’ with Improved Search Ranking, Human Evaluators & User Feedback By Zara Ali 12 hours ago 13Shares Share Tweet Submit Google had been struggling for a past few months to curb fake news. In the past, we reported about various tools in works that would be applied by Google to tackle such news sources. Today, the search engine giant has introduced “structural changes.” to shun the “spread of blatantly misleading, low quality, offensive or downright false information.” The company has identified the billions of indexed pages in its search results. Around 0.25 percent of daily search queries show up with “offensive or clearly misleading content.” Google has marked the issue as a different problem from existing fake news issues, but its motto stays the same – i.e.- to decrease the volume of such sources. Related Google Might Bring Its Default Ad-Blocking Feature for Chrome Browser In a blog post, Google writes: While this problem is different from issues in the past, our goal remains the same—to provide people with access to relevant information from the most reliable sources available. And while we may not always get it right, we’re making good progress in tackling the problem. In addition to applying algorithms, the tech giant is also using human moderators to evaluate the quality of search results to remove problematic queries. Google would record the evaluation of manual evaluators and utilize it as a feedback mechanism to identify problem areas to improve them. But, it won’t be using these assessments to determine single page rankings. By employing New Search Quality Rater Guidelines for low-quality pages that possess false information, unexpected offensive results, hoaxes and unsupported conspiracy theories. With these guidelines, algorithms will start placing low-quality on lower search result rankings. Advertisement Related Google Earth Gets Massive Update With Guided Tours, 3D View, and Voyager Features Google’s second tool “Ranking Changes” is for ranking pages on content. It has readjusted the signals that were used to determine search results. The new change would help in promoting “authoritative pages and demote low-quality content, so that issues similar to the Holocaust denial results that we saw back in December are less likely to appear.” It will also be taking help of users, by allowing them to flag faulty Featured Snippets and Autocomplete predictions. Users will be able to report such content by clicking on “Report inapproriate predictions” and “Feedback.” After clicking these options, users will see a box with labeled categories. Users will also be able to drop personalise comments to report the content, this feedback from users will be used by Google to improve search algorithms. These changes will also address issues with Google Home and earlier queries about why the search bar shows “shocking or offensive predictions in autocomplete.” Google has also listed these changes under its “Help Center” along with information for website owners under the “How Search Works” section.

In the Newington school system, Southington resident John “Jay” Salerno is the “go-to” for all things related to computers. Over the past 2.5 years as director of educational technology, Salerno has helped everyone in the Newington district—from administrators and teachers to students—transform learning in the classroom through the use of technology. That’s a big reason why Salerno was selected as one of 36 educators across the globe to be named as a “2017 Google Innovator.” The Google certified innovator program is a 12-month professional development experience, including mentorship, online learning activities, and an Innovation Academy. Salerno was named to the list in March, and he packed his bags this April to visit London for the Innovation Academy. There, Salerno will collaborate with educators from 11 countries to discuss ways to solve some of the most pressing issues facing technology integration in education. “Jay has worked diligently with our 1:1 Technology Program for our students and has worked to increase the technology based professional learning opportunities for our staff” Newington superintendent of schools Dr. William C. Collins said in a press release. “He has provided our students, teachers, and the district with a vision that has changed the way that we use technology in the classroom.” Salerno, a Southington High School graduate, has worked in Newington for over 19 years. He taught computer and business classes at Newington High School for 17 years, and he has served as the district’s director of educational technology since 2015. In his current position, Salerno helps to provide staff members with technology-based professional learning opportunities, and he oversees the deployment and management of over 4,000 student devices (iPads, laptops, and Chromebooks). On a daily basis, he works to assist K-12 teachers with technology integration in the classroom, while also supporting the district’s educational technology teachers with the student Techspert Program. This program allows students to be exposed to enrichment opportunities in the area of technology, while also being a resource for teachers, students, and the community that may need technology assistance. “After one of our educational technology teachers, Kate Wakefield developed the program for the elementary level, we definitely saw the opportunity to expand it to the middle schools and high school,” Salerno said in the press relase. “At Newington High School (NHS), the program is completely student run, where they are exposed to real-life experiences including assisting the IT Department with everyday tasks.” After being nominated as a Google Innovator, Salerno survived a vigorous application process, which included a proposal of an innovative idea in technology that he will work on with a mentor from Google to help it come to fruition over the course of the next year. In his proposal, entitled “Promoting Digital Equity and Social Justice through the ‘Techsperts’: Every Student, Everywhere,” Salerno envisions using the district’s Techspert and NHS Tech Support programs to assist in developing and facilitating empowering opportunities for all students to create, produce, use, and disseminate digital tools and resources in their lives. “It is not going to stop at providing opportunities just for students, not only is the community just as important, but the initiative can also be brought to other areas where the opportunities for exposure to technology are not present,” Salerno said in the release. In part, due to Salerno’s efforts in the district, Newington Public Schools was recently recognized as one of two Connecticut school districts named by Google as a “Reference District.” The distinction is bestowed upon districts that demonstrate excellence and thought leadership through the innovative use of technology—including G Suite for Education and Chromebooks—to drive impact and positive learning outcomes.

 YOUR E-MAIL VERIFICATION CODE This March 23, 2010, file photo, shows the Google logo at the Google headquarters in Brussels. (AP Photo) Google on Tuesday announced changes to how it delivers and ranks internet searches, the latest effort by the tech giant to weed out "fake news" and offensive content. The new initiative includes tweaks to the algorithm used by Google to deliver search results, while offering users more options to flag inappropriate content, including for "autocomplete," or the suggestions Google makes while someone is typing a search query. "Our algorithms help identify reliable sources from the hundreds of billions of pages in our index," Google vice president of engineering Ben Gomes said in a blog post. "However, it's become very apparent that a small set of queries in our daily traffic (around 0.25 percent), have been returning offensive or clearly misleading content, which is not what people are looking for." Gomes said that Google is seeking to crack down on "new ways that people try to game the system." "The most high profile of these issues is the phenomenon of 'fake news,' where content on the web has contributed to the spread of blatantly misleading, low quality, offensive or downright false information," he wrote. "While this problem is different from issues in the past, our goal remains the same -- to provide people with access to relevant information from the most reliable sources available." Both Google and Facebook have taken steps in recent months to curb the spread of hoaxes and misinformation amid concerns these may have influenced voters in the 2016 US election. Both firms have sought to cut off ad revenues to websites that promote false news, but have acknowledged they need to do more. Gomes said the latest effort is part of an ongoing process and includes "real people who assess the quality of Google's search results" and provide feedback. The tweak in search ranking aims "to help surface more authoritative pages and demote low-quality content," he added. Gomes said the effort aims to avert incidents that gained notoriety last year such as the high ranking of a website which claimed the Holocaust did not happen. Additionally, Google will make it easier for users to flag inappropriate "autocomplete" suggestions and "snippets" of website after some past embarrassments. "The content that appears in these features is generated algorithmically and is a reflection of what people are searching for and what's available on the web," Gomes said. "This can sometimes lead to results that are unexpected, inaccurate or offensive" Gomes said the new system enables users to "inform us directly if you find sensitive or unhelpful content." "We plan to use this feedback to help improve our algorithms," he added. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Previous in Tech The founder of online encyclopaedia Wikipedia has announced plans...

Google Search and Maps services have just been updated to help you find best places to go and things to do on your next trip. The new update will help you translate reviews from local language to your preferred one. It’s no doubt a small update, but big enough to help you find the best restaurant and where to shop without being faced with language issue. When next you are out of town and want to read a review, all Google does is to translate it from local to the language you have set on your device. The new update makes it so easy to find the best restaurants and places by just opening the Google Maps or Search apps on your device and search for what you want. There is no need to copy and paste because everything is done automatically on your device. Here is DK Kang, Associate Product Manager Google Maps in a blog post: “The best part is that you don’t have to do a thing. Just open Google Maps or Search, search for what you’re interested in and the reviews are automatically translated. Most people will see the translated review in the language they prefer and then see the review in the native language below—eliminating the hassle of copying and pasting into a translation app or trying to decipher reviews using your pocket-sized translation book.” With that [language] taken care of, shopping in your preferred location, and lodging in your desired hotel should no longer be an issue. A couple of days ago, Google added a new feature to the Maps app. The tech giant now wants to help you remember your whereabouts by adding a new Timeline feature to its Maps app. Google Maps, one of Google’s most used apps, will henceforth help you see a daily snapshot of your life on the iOS version of the app. The new update also helps you to control the information that appears in your Timeline and edit any location. The essence of this edit feature within your Timeline is to help you have accurate information always. In addition, you will be able to delete a day, a range, or your full history at any time you choose to. A variety of activity types were also added to the Maps app to enable you customize your modes of transportation and activities.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on: Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink: Purchase: Order Reprint SAN FRANCISCO – Before Sergey Brin and Larry Page founded Google, they wrote a research paper as doctoral students at Stanford University in which they questioned the appropriateness of ads on search engines. “It could be argued from the consumer point of view that the better the search engine is, the fewer advertisements will be needed for the consumer to find what they want,” they wrote in the 1998 paper. How times change. Two decades later, it’s not unusual for a smartphone user to see only ads on a Google search page before scrolling down to the regular results. When Google’s parent company, Alphabet, reports earnings on Thursday, the internet giant’s big profits are expected to demonstrate yet again that the billboard space accompanying Google queries is the web’s most valuable real estate for advertisements. In the 17 years since Google introduced text-based advertising above search results, the company has allocated more space to ads and created new forms of them. The ad creep on Google has pushed “organic” (unpaid) search results farther down the screen, an effect even more pronounced on the smaller displays of smartphones. The changes are profound for retailers and brands that rely on leads from Google searches to drive online sales. With limited space available near the top of search results, not advertising on search terms associated with your brand or displaying images of your products is tantamount to telling potential customers to spend their money elsewhere. Associated Press photos How it Changed: Google co-founders Sergey Brin, left, and Larry Page once questioned search engine ads. But the space with Google queries has become the web’s most valuable real estate for advertisements. The biggest development with search ads is the proliferation of product listing ads, or PLAs. In a departure from its text-based ads, Google started allowing retailers to post pictures, descriptions and prices of products at the top of search results in 2009. In recent years, Google has served more product ads and expanded their availability to more general search terms — for example, showing photo ads on a search for “running shoes,” not just “Nike Air Max.” It has also tinkered with the size, location and number of ads on results pages for both computers and smartphones. Retailers are snapping up product ads. They accounted for 52 percent of all Google search ad spending by retailers in the first quarter of 2017, vs. 8 percent in 2011, according to the digital marketing agency Merkle. “PLAs takes the search engine results page to a different level,” said Andy Taylor, Merkle’s associate director of research. A Google spokeswoman said the company’s goal had always been to quickly give people the best search results. “Our goal has always been to deliver results that people find immediately useful, which is even more important on mobile devices with smaller screens,” said spokeswoman Chi Hea Cho. “For most queries, we show no ads, and we recently removed right-hand text ads for all queries. For highly commercial queries, our extensive testing shows that people find relevant ads and offers extremely useful.” The importance of being at the top of search results is fueling fierce competition for ads. Reef, a beachwear manufacturer best known for its sandals, said it increased spending with Google 76 percent last year — mainly because it nearly quadrupled the money it put into product ads. On a search result, Reef is competing with other manufacturers of flip-flops, as well as retail partners selling Reef sandals. On a desktop computer, a Google search for “Reef flip-flops” brought back three text ads above the search results — one from Reef, one from Zappos and one from Amazon — selling Reef sandals. There were also nine image-based product listing ads displaying different Reef sandals for sale; only three were offered by reef.com while the rest were ads from other retailers. On a mobile phone, Reef is competing with even more retailers. The same search brought back only Reef’s text ad, but below a scrolling carousel featuring more than 20 image ads for different types of Reef flip-flops. Only the first two images linked to reef.com. “We’re competing against each other,” Jessica Levens, director of e-commerce at Reef, said about the company’s retail partners. “We need to spend the dollars to defend that real estate.” Levens said the advertising strategy was effective, although she had to convince her chief financial officer about the wisdom of spending more. Those product campaigns helped triple sales that started from online queries, including instances where customers searched without including the Reef brand name. Google’s prospecting for ad sales has not been limited to PLAs. The company has introduced new forms of search advertising for automobiles, hotels and even home services such as plumbing. “It’s impossible to rely simply on organic” search, said Caitlin Aylward, a senior associate at L2, a research and advisory firm for consumer brands. “The winner in all this is Google.” Product ads that appeal to shoppers are also strategically important because consumers are starting their online shopping at Amazon.com. Last year, a survey of 2,000 U.S. shoppers found that 55 percent turn to Amazon first when searching for a product, while only 28 percent start with a web search. While retailers and brands may feel like they have no choice but to spend on search advertising, many do so willingly because it works. Kristi Argyilan, a senior vice president of marketing at Target, said search advertising was accounting for a larger portion of her digital spending because the ads were “becoming so useful” and more relevant. Traffic from product listing ads accounted for more than 10 percent of sales on Target’s website, while information in the ads, such as whether a nearby store has inventory of a popular product, has provided important information to consumers. “The ads are becoming more purposeful,” Argyilan said. Marcio Jose Sanchez &#x2022; Associated Press In the 17 years since Google introduced text-based ads above search results, the company has allocated more space to ads and created new forms of them.   View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive, mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

(GuruFocus) When he was in college, Nicholas Britz planned to build robots. But once the dot-com bubble burst in 1999, he wanted to figure out how companies worked. “I had a moment right there where I wanted to help shape a company, and that kicked me on a different career path,” said Britz, who studied engineering and physics at Stanford University and Johns Hopkins University. Today, Britz manages the financial side of Google Fiber, the online giant’s subsidiary that falls under the Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL). It represents Google’s long-range attempt to expand into the highly territorial area of high-speed internet connectivity. “I left fintech external and now I’m working with fintech internally,” he said. Though “the heat and the excitement has slowed down a bit” in fintech, Britz said he’s still excited to be one of the judges at the Benzinga Global Fintech Awards, which will be held May 11 in New York City. “The idea of making these (financial analytical tools) more accessible to the common man and woman is especially exciting,” he said. Lessons Learned From Zecco In 2006, Britz helped launch Zecco Corp., a commission-free online brokerage on the cutting edge of financial technology, and took over its foreign exchange services in January 2009. The timing could have been better. “We started at just about the wrong time,” said Britz, who was running Zecco Forex for roughly half of his six years with the company. “But once we got into the storm, things started to heat up” in fintech. After a rough start, Zecco limited the number of free trades its customers could make and managed to ride the fintech wave until it was acquired by TradeKing in 2012. Britz landed at Google and is happy to be developing fintech on the inside. “I truly thought I was going to be building robotics,” said the father of three, who often bicycles to work at Google’s Mountain View, California, headquarters. He learned some valuable lessons at Zecco: “Product; Needs to solve a real problem for a lot of people. We had a great product at Zecco for active equity and options traders that were priced at a tremendous value. (But, it was hard to get there, and our product wasn't so great in the early days.)” “Team: If you're going to spend many hours and late nights working together, you need to love your team. It helps if they're smart and hard-working too. We were very fortunate at Zecco to have built a terrific team.” “Know your end game. Focus on the user, but make sure you know where you're going. Know what winning looks like and know what your exit(s) (going public, sale, merger, etc.) look like. This will help prioritize and focus your limited resources.” “Investors: You are going to need funding. It is essential that your investors are supportive and aligned to get through the hard spots.” “Follow-on big idea. At a minimum, it's necessary to have a good business plan; however, it's incredibly helpful to have a follow-on big idea that could be a 10x improvement to your plan if the core plan works.” Related Links: You Might Not Want To Get Too Attached To The Term 'Fintech' How Do Fintech Startups Actually Win Industry Awards?

The company already uses about 4 million gallons of surface water per day, writes the Post & Courier (via Mashable). Google has studied various options for cooling its servers and has found that pumping groundwater was the best solution. The request comes at a time when a commercial boom in the area has led to companies (and residents) using water at a faster rate than the aquifers can replenish. Scientists are currently studying the area’s water situation, attempting to determine how much water from the aquifers can be used before depleting supplies of groundwater. Tech companies that operate large data centers are putting a great deal of focus on water and energy use. Data centers used about 165 billion gallons of water to cool their servers and for the energy to power their facilities. That number is expected to rise to about 174 billion gallons in 2020, according to figures from the Energy Department’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.   Companies that don’t plan for the long-term when it comes to water risks are playing defense rather than offense, Josh Henretig*, senior director of environmental sustainability at Microsoft, told Environmental Leader last week. “They’re not able to make smart investments in new technologies and in mitigation efforts that would move production from one facility to another. They’re putting their brands and their reputations at risk.” Microsoft has recently increased its focus on water use for its data centers. The company examines where water scarcity issues exist, where the company operates, the costs associated with water withdrawal, the risk-adjusted prices for water based on the availability and the quality of water at those specific sites, Henretig said. For example, a Microsoft data center in San Antonio, Texas, still relied on cooling towers which largely depend on water. By evaluating water use in that location, the company realized it had critical operations in a water-stressed region. And looking at the cost of water for that facility, the company made the decision to invest more deeply in new technology to save water. That led to a direct investment in the data center, from water meters to other technologies, in order to make better use of recycled water. It resulted in a $140,000-a-year cost savings, and a 58-million-gallon avoidance of fresh water use at that data center per year. * Note: Henretig will be speaking on this topic at the Environmental Leader 2017 Conference in June.   Categories EL Conference, Facilities, Feature, Water The EHS Guidebook: Selecting, Implementing, and Using EHS Software Solutions Sponsored By: EtQ    Leveraging EHS Software in Support of Culture Changes Sponsored By: VelocityEHS    The New Energy Future - Challenges and Opportunities in Corporate Energy Management Sponsored By: Edison Energy    Approaches to Managing EHS&S Data Sponsored By: Enablon    Leave a Comment Cancel reply NEWSLETTER NEWSLETTER SIGNUP Join 100,000+ subscribers who gain a competitive advantage with our news and analysis.

Spotify Evan Selleck Contributing Editor | April 25, 2017 11 shares 8 1 0 2 0 0 0 0 0               Thanks to the popularity of the Amazon Echo and Google Home, we're going to see a lot more smart speakers coming down the pipe. Companies that may not have originally considered a hardware component to their traditional software platform may see an opening, and, more than anything, another means to net some money. Which is why it may not be all that surprising to hear that Spotify may be wading into the hardware market at some point in the future. A few reports surfaced recently pointing to job openings within Spotify that have, very clearly, a focus on hardware. And as anyone who uses Spotify knows, the company is a music streaming platform that doesn't have any devices to fill those job openings right now. But that could be changing. Of course, reading the tea leaves regarding the future of a company based on job openings isn't a guarantee by any means (sort of like trying to guess what Apple does next with its litany of patent applications), but the idea that Spotify could be looking to branch out is certainly an interesting one. Plus, as a Spotify user I have to ask myself if I'd even consider buying something like a smart speaker to listen to music. Personally, that's all the Google Home was doing before I ultimately handed it over to a family member. I didn't need the speaker to tell me the news, because that's simply part of my routine when I turn my computer on every morning. I didn't need weather updates, or have any desire to do searches with my voice. When it wasn't playing music it was playing trivia games. Google Home and the Amazon Echo serve specific purposes for both companies that create the smart speakers, and Spotify's attempt --if it exists-- would be no different. The company would position it as another connected device that responds to the owner's voice, and it would probably have some pretty great speakers (one would hope) to fill your place with music. I can't help but wonder if the device would have something like Amazon's Alexa on board, too, just for good measure. And then one has to ask if you, as a potential buyer, would prefer a Spotify speaker with Alexa or Google Assistant built in. Having options is pretty great, especially for a completely theoretical device. I'm not entirely sure that I'd pick one up, but pricing would be the biggest factor either way. Spotify would have to be aggressive with pricing, going up against Amazon and Google, and may even have to undercut the competition to make their own smart speaker seem like an option. Then again, if Spotify was simply throwing in smart controls to a speaker that it sees as a competitive product to, say, Sonos, well ... that wiggle room for price certainly skyrockets. What do you think? Should Spotify venture out and create a smart speaker of its own? Or should the company keep its focus on its streaming music service? Let me know!

Share Tweet Share Email Comments Print DETROIT — Fiat Chrysler and Google for the first time will offer rides to the public in the self-driving vehicles they are building under an expanding partnership. The companies announced in the spring of last year that they would build 100 self-driving Chrysler Pacifica hybrids minivans. Those vehicles have been tested in Arizona, California and Michigan. Waymo, Google’s self-driving car project, said today that it will allow hundreds of people in Phoenix to take rides in the vehicles so that it can get feedback on the experience. Phoenix-area residents can apply on Waymo’s website. The company also said that it’s expanding its fleet to 500 Pacifica hybrids. Waymo — created by Google in 2009 — has given rides to the public before in its hometown of Mountain View, California. In 2015, it let a blind man ride around Austin, Texas, in one of its completely self-driving pods. The Phoenix program will be much larger in scale, and it will be the first to use the Pacifica minivans. Waymo isn’t the first to put regular passengers in self-driving cars in the race to develop the technology. Ride-hailing company Uber has had self-driving Volvos on the road in Pittsburgh since last fall. Boston startup nuTonomy is giving taxi rides to passengers in Singapore and Boston. In all cases, there is a backup driver behind the wheel. Waymo said it wants to learn where people want to go in a self-driving vehicle, how they communicate with it and what kinds of information and controls they want. Fiat Chrysler builds the Pacifica minivan in Windsor, Canada, just across the border from Detroit. It adds Waymo’s self-driving software and hardware, including sensors and cameras, at a facility in Michigan. Fiat Chrysler’s U.S. headquarters is in Auburn Hills, Michigan. “This collaboration is helping both companies learn how to bring self-driving cars to market, and realize the safety and mobility benefits of this technology,” said Waymo chief John Krafcik in a company release. Michelle Krebs, an executive analyst for the car shopping site Autotrader, says studies have shown that a majority of Americans are still reluctant to ride in a fully self-driving car. Opening Waymo’s vehicles to the public will help build riders’ confidence, she said. “The key to acceptance is exposure and education,” she said. Ultimately, Waymo says, self-driving cars could prevent many of the 1.2 million deaths that occur on worldwide roads each year. Waymo has made clear that it intends to form partnerships with automakers and not build its own self-driving cars. It’s also in talks with Honda Motor Co. about a potential collaboration.

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   Google tweaks search to fight fake news, hatred By Levi Sumagaysay / April 25, 2017 at 10:45 AM As the fallout from fake news continues, Google is trying to improve search. Acknowledging that the blatant spreading of misleading or false information is “different from issues in the past,” Ben Gomes, vice president of engineering, said in a blog post Tuesday that Google is tweaking search rankings, making it easier for people to provide feedback and will be more transparent about how its search engine works. “We’ve adjusted our signals to help surface more authoritative pages and demote low-quality content, so that issues similar to the Holocaust denial results that we saw back in December are less likely to appear,” Gomes wrote. Google and Facebook have been in the spotlight over fake news since the 2016 U.S. presidential election and Donald Trump’s victory. Both companies have since rolled out different tools to try to combat fake news, including fact-check labels and other initiatives, and pledged to starve purveyors of ad revenue. Gomes said Google will now make it easier for people to flag questionable content in autocomplete and the featured snippets that appear with search results. Users will be able to let Google know if an autocomplete option or featured snippet is “hateful,” “racist,” “sexually explicit,” “violent” and more. (One recent report showed that Google autocomplete was being gamed by the right wing.) This feedback is expected to help Google’s algorithms return higher-quality results. In other related news, Jimmy Wales of Wikipedia fame is launching Wikitribune, a crowdsourced news platform that aims to fight the proliferation of fake news with professional journalists and volunteer fact-checkers.   Top: Screen shot of Google search.

In a post Tuesday, Google announced several major changes to how it categorizes search results to stop inadvertently promoting sites with intentionally misleading or false articles. Google said the search company plans to implement algorithmic changes to the way it sorts individual pages to elevate high-authority pages and demote low-quality or factually incorrect content. Read: Google Changes Search To Detect, Flag Incorrect Content, Fake News This major internal change follows Google’s earlier adjustments to its human quality rater evaluation process. Google has previously used live staffers who manually evaluated the quality of search results — while these results didn’t directly change individual search results, Google used the data to calibrate its page ratings. Now, quality raters can use more detailed tags intended to target pages that intentionally produce misleading information. Users can also provide direct feedback and flag problematic results from Google’s AutoComplete and Featured Snippets field, which displays answers to search questions in a dedicated field above search results. Read: Google Fact Check Helps Identify Fake News, Now Available In Search While Google’s internal search adjustments are more substantial for the search company, the re-evaluation of its Featured Snippets and AutoComplete fields will be the more front-facing update for most Google users. Notably, the Featured Snippets feature produced several public embarrassments for Google. Search results for questions like “are women evil” or “did the Holocaust happen” prominently displayed information from unverified sources in the Featured Snippets field.

Hyper-target and remarket to past users. The internet is a rabbit hole of information. With over one billion websites in the ether, and over half of those active, the process of getting found online is much more complex than launching a website and hoping people will come across it. A solid search engine optimization (SEO) strategy is one way to rank well on the search engine results pages (SERPs), but this is a time consuming and ongoing process, and in competitive markets, it does not always yield first-page results. For those looking to land on the first page of Google, appear where prospective leads are hanging out online, and increase brand awareness, pay-per-click advertising with Google Adwords is the best way to do it. Here are three ways to use Google AdWords to generate leads for your business. Search advertising Search advertising is what most people think of when they hear the term pay-per-click. Advertisers are able to bid on certain keywords (such as “real estate Boston” or “Los Angeles real estate agent”) and appear at the top of the SERPs when these queries are performed. The best thing about this form of advertising is you only pay when someone actually clicks on your ad and lands on your website. The amount you pay per click depends on how many other advertisers are bidding on the same word or search term, and your bid can be adjusted so you’re certain to appear on that coveted first page. Academic research shows that 91 percent of searchers do not go past the first page of Google, so if you can’t do it organically, pay-per-click is the next best option. Display advertising Display ads are image ads placed on websites throughout the internet. Using Display advertising on Google AdWords is essential for brand awareness and is one of the most cost-effective ways to get your name and brand out to a targeted audience. With display advertising, you can choose the websites your ads appear on and target your ads by interest, location, demographics, in-market and affinity audiences, and you can choose whether you pay per click, impression or acquisition (conversion). Although display advertising has a lower conversion rate than search advertising, when the two campaign types are leveraged together, they produce maximum results. Remarketing You are most likely familiar with remarketing ads by now. Although they seem creepy to begin with, these laser targeted ads, which “follow” you after visiting certain websites, are highly effective as they serve as reminders of products or services that you have already shown interest in. Remarketing ads are essential for staying front of mind with potential leads. After a visitor has landed on your website (either through a Google AdWords campaign, social media, organically or from a referral site), a cookie is stored on their computer. This allows you to create a specific display ad with a strong call to action targeting this audience as they browse online. Click-thru-rates and conversions with remarketing campaigns are often higher, and return on ad spend (ROAS) is greater with this hyper-targeted form of online advertising. For those who haven’t tried Google AdWords yet, now is a great time to start. Activate a simple AdWords Express Account, spend some time getting to know the AdWords interface or hire someone to do it for you. Google AdWords is one of the most effective ways to send highly targeted leads to your website, and the best part is, you only pay per click.

Google's new search tools and changes could help combat fake news Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/25 10:37am PDTApr 25, 2017 15 Plus 1 on G+ 23 Share on Facebook 55 Share on Twitter Total Shares93 Google News Since time immemorial (1998) Google's bread, butter, and raison d'être has been search. Now Google's changing the way search works a bit, empowering users by adding new feedback tools and changing results from their search ranking to bring you more relevant and accurate information. With these changes users should see less in the way of so-called "fake news" and other non-factual content (excluding searches for that material), and more accurate and relevant information pertaining to their search. The biggest user-facing change you are likely to see is probably the new feedback link. It allows users to tag snippets —the short bits of text you might see that directly answer questions posed in a search —or autocomplete results as being accurate, inaccurate, offensive, or just disliked. There's no telling yet exactly how Google may or may not use the data collected via reports, but at a minimum it may go some way to prevent a few of the problems they've seen. I know in the past I've seen snippets come up that are either entirely incorrect or totally unrelated to a search. Hopefully this doesn't just present a new vector for further rank manipulation in autocomplete, though. The changes to search sorting are pretty straightforward. Google's had some problems in the past with sites manipulating how they appear on results. After all, anything that's governed by a set of rules can be gamed using those rules. Even without that Google's had some problems with factually inaccurate results appearing on top of results. They'll be making new changes to ranking to avoid that sort of thing in the future, and they're redoubling their efforts with Google's human oversight in determining quality of results. Their content policy has been updated with the details, and their educational portal on how their Search works has also been changed. Until we see how searches are changed there's no way to know if the new tools might open another means for manipulation of results. While it's possible some might use it as a means of censorship or calumny, hopefully the system is robust enough to resist that type of manipulation. Either way, we shall see.

Luciano Damn, MJ was spot on. He said you're coming and here you are! F4LL0U7 Well yesterday's March For Science post is a pretty good indication of how this comment section is about to play out... M. Luciano I must have missed it - wtf is controversial about supporting science? F4LL0U7 A lot, apparently! Check it out. http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/04/24/went-protest-app/#comment-3271548575 Sir_Brizz I think it's wrong to simplify both the "March for Science" and whatever happened in that comments section to "supporting science". Most people would agree with "supporting science" but it is rarely that simple. If you don't understand what problem a reasonably intelligent person would have had with the march or that post, then that probably warrants further investigation on your part to form your own opinions. M. Luciano I was surprised to hear that there was any controversy over the march for science. Science seems like one of the most uncontroversial things one could "march" for. The article didn't mention any controversy, unless people creating an app to collect data at protests is controversial, but then almost every app on every platform would be controversial. Nicholas Conrad It wasn't a march for science, it was just called a march for science. It was a march in support of a particular set of policy prescriptions. Anyone who really supports science would know that science can't be in favor of one policy or another, it can only inform the discussion of costs and benefits of varying policies which then have to be weighed. M. Luciano Furthermore, a Google search for "March for Science Controversy" turns up no controversy. Just a bunch of articles explaining who and what is going on. Is there an actual controversy? People supporting the scientific method and it's application to the challenges of our current world and society... that's not controversial. Nicholas Conrad Clearly a media conspiracy; is mj lamestream? MJ The first of the manipulated BLOCKED! This is NOT a free speech issue so I would suggest a First Amendment 101 class. cooldude5500 Man I loved to search something weird for the predictions so that I could see the most outrageous thing that people were searching for.

That would be a plus. rebretz000 I think the fact that a tool like this is needed is biggest problem. I can't believe that there are persons out there so gullible that they will believe almost anything posted online. Averix A lot of people don't cross check articles and only read headlines.

Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ As long as I can filter out /r/the_donald I think that will take care of the majority of it. F4LL0U7 Heads up, a handful of users you've never seen on AP before are about to rain their barely literate rantings upon you. As an example, check out the March For Science post from yesterday. A Person People who attend science marches only push their belief in science when it suits their interests, not when it comes to male is male and female is female. M. Luciano Did that make sense when you wrote it? A Person Yes, it makes sense. M. Luciano What exactly is the scientific understanding of the relationships between sex and gender? We could try sociological, biological and psychological. Let us know when you're ready to read up on the hundreds of peer reviewed studies and provide an analysis. F4LL0U7 People who say things like that have likely never had a child, relative, or friend who turned out to be trans. And even if you haven't, why not try having a little empathy? Life might be more enjoyable, and you might be less angry at things that have absolutely no impact on you whatsoever. A Person That is very selfish of you to enforce others believe or acknowledge something simply because you yourself have experienced. If you have a friend, child, or relative that thinks they should have been the opposite sex, and you didn't attempt to get them psychiatric help, then you dropped the ball. F4LL0U7 I'm sure I should just block you and end this waste of time, but I'll ask anyway: do you think homosexuals need psychiatric help as well, or do you think that's a valid way for a person to live their life? A Person I'm sorry, do all homosexuals think you can switch back and forth between male or female, or whatever other gender you want to make up? If that is the case, then we can talk. I see "other person typing"... but sorry, I'm out... you people are batsh!t crazy. fijisiv Dude keep it up. I have never seen somebody so proud of their ignorance! Is it painful to watch? Is it sad? Is it humorous? Yes. F4LL0U7 Really? Never? (Had to bring it all back around to Devin's OP) https://az616578.vo.msecnd.net/files/responsive/embedded/any/desktop/2016/07/30/636055042891058227364682665_2.jpg Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Kudos to you and @disqus_DIvkrvAJjQ:disqus for attempting to educate @disqus_abcdefg:disqus, but sadly it seems they would rather hide in their little hole and pretend the world is black and white. F4LL0U7 You'd have to take a survey. But I would bet that most of them would be open to modern science, empathy, and leaving people the hell alone. That question was just a litmus test for your level of tolerance to other humans that may or may not fall into your perfect worldview. Sir_Brizz I'll vote for leaving people alone, although that is something that is rarely afforded to others. Nathan Walters You're the one refusing to acknowledge empirical evidence and human experience. Pot, meet kettle. MJ Holy Crap! I could have sworn that I BLOCKED (fixed) you long ago. Dude, stop with your endless ignorant comments. You have never said anything resembling intelligence on any subject here. Are people really this dumb or are most of them actually just trolls? Impossible to tell or know I guess... F4LL0U7 If you're out, does that mean you're not coming back, and I don't have to bother blocking you? Nathan Walters Wait, do you even know what science has to say about issues of biological sex? I'm guessing not. A Person Science says there are two genders, not Facebook's 58... or whatever count they're up to now. F4LL0U7 Sure, if the most recent science book you've read is the bible. A Person LOL... I haven't said anything about the bible. You're a guy or a girl and whatever logic you want to make up in order to twist two genders into 50+... well, let me get my popcorn. M. Luciano This is just as false as it was 4 minutes ago. Most people are a guy or a girl or both, but some are neither. F4LL0U7 I'll refer you to @disqus_DIvkrvAJjQ:disqus's post above, since they've already done the research, and I have to get back to work. M. Luciano You're wrong. "Science" holds 8 known sexes and three known genders. The sexes are X0, XX, XY, ZZ, ZW, WW, Hermaphrodite and asexual. The genders are male, female and neuter. This does not include chromosomal anomalies, such as XXY, XXYY, X and XXX. A Person lol... This is like if I were to argue that "tires can only be round", so your argument becomes "round isn't the only shape". M. Luciano No, it's as if you said, "people are male or female" and then I stated that the scientific understanding is that people are one of eight sexes and one of three genders. Because that's what actually happened. So you were incorrect because you were ignorant of the actual information available to you, now that you have it, you can learn. A Person Dude, I brought up gender and you brought up sex. Why do SJWs like yourself feel it necessary to complicate things as much as possible? M. Luciano You used them interchangeably with Nathan Walters, so figured you wanted to know that they're different. But even if you want to stick to gender only, there are 3, not 2. A Person I didn't use them interchangeably. I brought up gender. He then brought up sex. I didn't bring up sex. This is ridiculous. M. Luciano He brought up sex, you then referred to it as gender ... either way, 3 > 2. And either way, it has absolutely nothing to do with the overall topic of search results. F4LL0U7 The world is complicated, dude. And if something as simple as rethinking your pronouns can make life a little less complicated for people who are having a hard enough time as it is, then why not do it? In your mind, is being a Social Justice Warrior a bad thing? Seems like fighting for social justice is something to be proud of. F4LL0U7 More accurately, it's as if you said "tires are the only things that allow vehicles to move" and then @disqus_DIvkrvAJjQ:disqus cited tank treads, skis, wings, and propellors as other examples. A Person You're right, he/she/ze/it/them/they sounds even crazier when you put it that way. F4LL0U7 Maybe this concept wouldn't be so difficult for you if you spoke another language. Most other languages besides English have gender-neutral pronouns. If English did, then maybe you wouldn't be so offended by having to consider someone's gender identity before referring to them. Nathan Walters There aren't even only 2 sexes, why should the existence of more genders come as any surprise? Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a1ca661e6cd51072403c87d1161ea33d1aa68181de414832321558ead5d02819.jpg Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8f111e2cbfab6a1ab9e37e4dcb1b4e74b67793df6767debf1233b63590f83b15.jpg F4LL0U7 It's funny because 1) you think I'm a Democrat, and 2) you are hours late to this discussion and are making the same exact mistake as @disqus_abcdefg:disqus. kr3000 Excellent, a right wing news blocker. Because diversity of thought is like fascist and stuff. C Lo What could possibly go wrong... Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Bahahahahaha! As if I trust Google. I tried this myself with Google vs. Duckduckgo, searching for "Hillary Clinton is a". The results for Google have changed slightly, but they're still flattering. Duckduckgo still suggests criminal, liar, crook, murderer, etc. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/50818a751a00330950eceeca37a2b4d6b8f74ee8691ca9854e4ade9962a6264e.jpg F4LL0U7 Try that with any person in Google and you'll see the same discrepancy. Google already explained this (several months ago, welcome to the party!). They don't associate people's names with negative words in autocomplete. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ That's funny, because I get "Donald Trump is a" cheeto, dinosaur, democrat (now THAT is an insult) on Google. In fact, I get a lot of insulting suggestions for other people. "Bill O'Reilly is a" wife beater? So your explanation does not pass the smell test. F4LL0U7 You won't get suggestions about Trump being a liar (despite video evidence) or a crook (despite him settling out of court for defrauding attendees of his "university"). Google simply does not suggest terms like that. Here's an idea -- Google it. It was in the news almost a year ago. Doby Gillis Seems you need to look up safe space since you're acting like a special, little, snowflake. Bruce Wayne Google is notoriously liberal so it's no surprise that they suppress negative comments about a liberal former presidential candidate and boost negative comments about a Republican president. I just looked up "Hillary Clinton is a..." and I got democrat, war hawk, hologram and hero. I did the same for Trump and got dinosaur, cheeto, gemini etc. And Google expects us to trust them with filtering for "fake news". HA! Scott Will the Google App get search tools?? D.Smithee How about they combat the absolute deluge of fake reviews in the Play Store. Geezus.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars CLOUD Google cuts Zync cloud media rendering prices by up to 31% Jordan Novet@jordannovet April 25, 2017 12:17 PM Above: Google headquarters in Mountain View, California. Image Credit: Drew Tarvin/Flickr In conjunction with the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) Show in Las Vegas, today Google announced cuts to the prices of its Zync media rendering services that run on servers that Google offers through its Google Cloud Platform (GCP) public cloud. Google acquired Zync in 2014 and launched a beta version of the service running atop Google infrastructure in 2015. Animators and visual effects artists could use render farms in on-premises data centers instead of relying on Zync, but public cloud infrastructure can scale out across lots of machines, and companies end up only paying for what they use. Now sending jobs out to Google servers for rendering from the Autodesk Maya, Maxon Cinema 4D, and SideFX Houdini desktop applications will cost up to 31 percent less than before, Todd Prives, Zync’s former chief product and marketing officer and now a Google product manager, wrote in a blog post. Using Pixar’s RenderMan rendering technology with Maya will cost 56 cents per hour with Google’s preemptible virtual machines (VMs) and 84 cents an hour with regular on-demand VMs. The news comes weeks after public cloud market leader Amazon Web Services (AWS) acquired Thinkbox Software, which manages media rendering jobs. Google regularly announces price cuts to the core computing and storage services that it provides. AWS and Microsoft Azure do that, too. Today’s cuts reflect the decreasing costs of the underlying raw cloud infrastructure and suggest that Zync is still a meaningful product for Google — it’s not being discontinued, unlike some other Google applications and services. Also today, Google said Zync will support Arnold Render from the Cinema 4D program. “Arnold is a renderer used in countless feature film, advertising, VR and television projects and support in Cinema 4D allows Zync users to scale to tens of thousands of cores on demand when rendering a scene with Arnold,” Prives wrote.

Fiat Chrysler and Google said Tuesday, April 25, 2017, for the first time will offer rides to the public in the self-driving automobiles they are building under an expanding partnership. Carlos Osorio, File AP Photo Business April 25, 2017 3:14 PM FCA, Google begin offering rides in self-driving cars By DEE-ANN DURBIN AP Auto Writer LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story DETROIT Fiat Chrysler and Google for the first time will offer rides to the public in the self-driving vehicles they are building under an expanding partnership. Waymo, Google's self-driving car project, said Tuesday it's adding 500 Chrysler Pacifica hybrid minivans to its self-driving vehicle fleet. It will allow hundreds of people in the Phoenix area to take rides in the vehicles so it can get feedback on the experience. Phoenix-area residents could apply on Waymo's website starting Tuesday. The vehicles will also pick up riders in Chandler, Tempe, Mesa and Gilbert, Waymo said. All of the vehicles will have Waymo backup drivers who can take over in an emergency. Fiat Chrysler and Waymo have been partners since last spring, when they announced they would build 100 self-driving Pacifica hybrids minivans. Those vehicles were delivered to Waymo in December. The companies have been testing the vehicles in Arizona, California and Michigan. Waymo began offering a small number of public rides in Arizona two months ago before deciding to expand the program, a spokesman said. Waymo — created by Google in 2009 — has given rides to the public before in its hometown of Mountain View, California. In 2015, it let a blind man ride around Austin, Texas, in one of its completely self-driving pods. The Phoenix program will be much larger in scale, and it will be the first to use the Pacifica minivans. Waymo isn't the first to put regular passengers in self-driving cars in the race to develop the technology. Ride-hailing company Uber has had self-driving Volvos on the road in Pittsburgh since last fall. Boston startup nuTonomy is giving taxi rides to passengers in Singapore and Boston. In all cases, there is a backup driver behind the wheel. Waymo said it wants to learn where people want to go in a self-driving vehicle, how they communicate with it and what kinds of information and controls they want. Fiat Chrysler builds the Pacifica minivan in Windsor, Canada, just across the border from Detroit. It adds Waymo's self-driving software and hardware, including sensors and cameras, at a facility in Michigan. Fiat Chrysler's U.S. headquarters is in Auburn Hills, Michigan. "This collaboration is helping both companies learn how to bring self-driving cars to market, and realize the safety and mobility benefits of this technology," said Waymo chief John Krafcik in a company release. Michelle Krebs, an executive analyst for the car shopping site Autotrader, says studies have shown that a majority of Americans are still reluctant to ride in a fully self-driving car. Opening Waymo's vehicles to the public will help build riders' confidence, she said. "The key to acceptance is exposure and education," she said. Ultimately, Waymo says, self-driving cars could prevent many of the 1.2 million deaths that occur on worldwide roads each year. Waymo has made clear that it intends to form partnerships with automakers and not build its own self-driving cars. It's also in talks with Honda Motor Co. about a potential collaboration.

This means higher quality translations on pages containing everything from song lyrics to news articles to cricket discussions.” The below image showcases Google’s use of neural machine translation. On the left, a webpage in Indonesian, which is unreadable for anyone who doesn’t speak the language. In the middle, that same page translated into English without neural machine translation, followed on the right by the same page translated into English with neural machine translation.

While smartphone photography has excelled in recent years thanks to these techniques, there are still physical limitations. Pushing the boundaries of what’s possible, one Googler experimented with capturing low-light shots with the Nexus 6P and Pixel. The resulting nighttime photography, though requiring heavy post-processing, is comparable to a DSLR. Nintendo Switch Florian Kainz, who previously worked on the Gcam team at Google Research, wrote a simple camera app with manual control over exposure time, ISO, and focus distance. Similar to the principles behind HDR, up to 64 frames are captured. The app saves the raw frames from the sensor as DNG files for later editing on a PC. For the moment, editing is the most important step in achieving the excellent photos in the gallery below: The individual frames were very grainy, as one would expect given the tiny sensor in a cellphone camera, but computing the mean of all 32 frames cleaned up most of the grain, and subtracting the mean of the 32 black frames removed faint grid-like patterns caused by local variations in the sensor’s black level. The resulting image, shown below, looks surprisingly good. Kainz also successfully took shots of a nighttime landscape featuring stars, as well as shots with minimal to no lighting from the moon. This experiment shows that phone cameras are “suitable” for outdoor nighttime photography.

To start, the company has updated its Search Quality Rater Guidelines to provide clearer examples of low-quality results. This document provides guidance that real people use to test and rank the company’s search results. Google then uses the data it collects from those testers to refine how its search algorithm works. As such, Google promises it will get better at filtering out fake news in weeks and months to come. Moving forward, the company has also made it easier for Search users to flag inappropriate autocomplete results and featured snippets, with a link that allows them to report suggestions directly from the results page. Finally, in an effort to be more transparent, Google has updated its help center page to detail its new content removal policies. The company has also launched a new “how search works” website that details the inner workings of its search engine. Google’s aim here is to avoid situations like the one the happened in December when the top result for the query “did the Holocaust happen?” came from a white supremacist website Stormfront. Ben Gomes, vice-president of engineering at Google, promises that such results “are less likely to appear” in the future. Today’s announcement is just the latest move Google has made towards combating fake news appearing on its search engine. Earlier this month, the company added new fact-checking cards to both Search and News results. Sourced from PolitiFact and Snopes, the cards detail a claim, where it came from and, most importantly, its veracity. The feature is available to Canadian Search and News users.

Why are vinyl records still a thing 4 Reasons Why Vinyl Is Better Than Digital 4 Reasons Why Vinyl Is Better Than Digital Greetings, peasants! What, still listening to MP3s? Look, as someone who knows more about music than you, I think it's my duty to tell you there's a better way. It's called vinyl. Read More ? The answer to both of these questions is audio quality. Even though we now stream most of our music, we instinctively know it doesn’t sound as good as what we heard on our old CDs. Thankfully there are ways to make your streaming music app of choice sound better. From Apple Music to Tidal, all the major music streaming services are capable of playing better audio quality. The secret is hidden in the settings, with most apps set to “basic” quality by default to ensure that streaming is smooth. What Makes Audio Quality Better? When any app streams music, it usually encodes it as an MP3 How Audio Compression Works, and Can You Really Tell the Difference? How Audio Compression Works, and Can You Really Tell the Difference? In this article, we'll take a look at how music compression works, and whether it has any real effect on how your music actually sounds. Read More . MP3 being a compressed digital audio format. The compression process means you lose some audio quality. To retain quality, you need to use a lossless digital audio format, like FLAC or Apple Lossless Audio Codec (ALAC). For a rough estimate, an MP3 file usually transmits 128–192 Kbps. On the other hand, a FLAC file usually transmits 1411 kilobits of data per second. The difference is massive, and hence, a FLAC file is much larger than an MP3 file. You can compare different audio formats here 10 Common Audio Formats Compared: Which One Should You Use? 10 Common Audio Formats Compared: Which One Should You Use? We may all be familiar with MP3, what about AAC, FLAC, OGG, or WMA? Why do so many standards exist? Which ones should you care about and which ones can you ignore? Read More . Every streaming service’s success lies on how quickly and smoothly it can play the song you want to listen to. Streaming apps therefore prefer compressed audio formats like MP3. If you change the format to a lossless format, your audio quality will improve. The good news is all of these streaming music apps apps give you the option to switch up the quality. Spotify If you don’t change the audio quality, you’re missing a trick to getting the most out of Spotify Streaming Music Secrets: How To Get More Out Of Spotify Streaming Music Secrets: How To Get More Out Of Spotify As brilliant as the standard Spotify experience is, it can be improved via the use of websites and apps, transforming an already excellent service into an unmissable one. Read More . The process is different on the desktop app, the iOS app, and the Android app. Either way you’ll need a Spotify Premium account for this. On Desktop — Go to Menu > Settings > High Quality Streaming On iOS — Go to Your Library > Settings > Stream Quality > High (or Extreme) On Android — Go to Your Library > Settings > Music Quality and choose the quality for Streaming or for Download. In the iOS and Android app, you can also choose the quality of downloaded music from Spotify. It’s labelled as “Sync Quality”, which again has Normal, High, or Extreme quality as options. Spotify classifies Normal Quality as 96 Kbps, High Quality as 160 Kbps, and Extreme as 320 Kbps. It’s not lossless audio, but even with compression, 320 Kbps is excellent. Apple Music Even though Apple has a lossless codec (ALAC), it doesn’t use it for Apple Music. All Apple Music songs use AAC 10 Essential Apple Music Tips You Really Need to Know 10 Essential Apple Music Tips You Really Need to Know Since its launch in 2015, Apple Music has come a long way, baby. Unfortunately, it's still not the easiest or most intuitive service to get to grips with. Which is where we come in... Read More , a similar process to MP3 that delivers compressed lossy files. By default, Apple Music uses its high quality AAC files, which play at 256 Kbps. When you are using cellular data, it switches to the lower quality files. You can choose to also listen to high quality audio while on cellular data. On iOS — Go to the Settings app on your iPhone, and tap Music > Mobile Data to choose. On Android — In the Apple Music app, go to Menu > Settings > Playback > High Quality on Cellular and toggle it on. Apple Music does not allow users to change the quality of downloaded music. By default, it downloads music files at High Quality. You can’t change the quality setting when listening to Apple Music through iTunes on Windows or Mac. You’re stuck on High Quality, since Apple assumes you are using Wi-Fi or some sort of broadband connectivity. In your face, 4G hotspot users! Google Play Music Google has three quality settings: low, normal, and high. But it refuses to divulge what this means in bitrate. The educated guess across different forums puts it to mean low at 128 Kbps, normal at 192 Kbps, and high at 320 kbps. Plus, you can set it differently for cellular and Wi-Fi data. On Android — Go to Menu > Settings > Playback > Quality on mobile network to change the setting. Below it, you’ll find Quality on wifi network to change that. In Menu > Settings > Playback > Downloading, you can adjust the quality of downloaded files as well. Google Play Music’s Chrome desktop app The 7 Best Google Play Music Features The 7 Best Google Play Music Features Is Google Play Music worth trying? Here are seven of the most compelling features you'll find within Google's streaming music service. Read More doesn’t let you change the setting. We assume it’s set to “Always High”, since that’s the default Wi-Fi setting on the mobile app. Tidal Tidal rose to prominence as a streaming music app that finally offers true lossless audio Tidal Ups the Ante to Appeal to Audiophiles Tidal Ups the Ante to Appeal to Audiophiles Not content with merely offering high-fidelity audio, Tidal is now adding what it calls "master-quality recordings". But will this be enough to tempt people to subscribe to Tidal? Read More . It’s the only app to stream FLAC files at 1411 Kbps. If you’re an audiophile with the best headphones on your ears, this is the streaming service you need. On desktop — In the left-hand menu, go to Settings > Streaming > Quality to adjust. On Android and iOS — In the Tidal app, go to Menu > Settings > Quality to find different options. Here, you can separately adjust WiFi Streaming Quality, Cellular Streaming Quality, Audio Download Quality, and Video Download Quality. HiFi/Master is FLAC, while Normal and High are compressed music files. You cannot adjust the quality of downloaded files from the desktop app. Deezer Deezer is the oft-overlooked music streaming app, but it has plenty going for it Everything You Need to Know About Deezer Music Everything You Need to Know About Deezer Music Deezer has finally launched in the U.S., and unlike other music streaming services with potential, Deezer is actually good enough to compete with the big boys. Here's everything you need to know... Read More . Like the bigwigs, it also offers granular control over audio quality. And you can stream in lossless FLAC if you have a Sonos. On Windows or Mac — In the Deezer app, go to Settings > Audio Settings > Audio Quality On Android and iOS — In the Deezer app, go to My Music > Audio Settings > Audio Quality > Custom You can adjust music quality for streaming with cellular data, streaming over Wi-Fi, downloading with cellular, and downloading over Wi-Fi. Deezer also offers a “Deezer Elite” standard, which uses lossless FLAC files. However, this is only available to owners of Sonos wireless systems (read our review of Sonos Sonos PLAY:1 Review and Giveaway Sonos PLAY:1 Review and Giveaway Read More ). Recommended Audio Settings Yes, high-quality audio is excellent, but cellular data technology hasn’t caught up to it yet. If you’re sitting in one spot with excellent 4G network connectivity, you can stream a FLAC file from Tidal without issues. But if you are moving around, prepare for a stuttering stream and waiting for audio files to buffer. It’s not only FLAC, even the high quality settings on Apple Music and Google Play Music struggle with this. So for all of the services we recommend: Quality over cellular data — Not over 192 Kbps. Quality over Wi-Fi (for broadband connections under 2 Mbps): Not over 320 Kbps. Quality over Wi-Fi (for broadband connections of 2 Mbps or more): FLAC lossless audio. Does Audio Quality Matter to You? Tidal and Deezer offer music quality that Spotify, Apple Music, and Google Play Music don’t offer. But does that really matter? Do you care about the option to listen to FLAC lossless audio when you choose a music streaming app? Or are Spotify and Apple Music simply good enough for you?

Google's new search tools and changes could help combat fake news Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/25 10:37am PDTApr 25, 2017 15 Plus 1 on G+ 23 Share on Facebook 55 Share on Twitter Total Shares93 Google News Since time immemorial (1998) Google's bread, butter, and raison d'être has been search. Now Google's changing the way search works a bit, empowering users by adding new feedback tools and changing results from their search ranking to bring you more relevant and accurate information. With these changes users should see less in the way of so-called "fake news" and other non-factual content (excluding searches for that material), and more accurate and relevant information pertaining to their search. The biggest user-facing change you are likely to see is probably the new feedback link. It allows users to tag snippets —the short bits of text you might see that directly answer questions posed in a search —or autocomplete results as being accurate, inaccurate, offensive, or just disliked. There's no telling yet exactly how Google may or may not use the data collected via reports, but at a minimum it may go some way to prevent a few of the problems they've seen. I know in the past I've seen snippets come up that are either entirely incorrect or totally unrelated to a search. Hopefully this doesn't just present a new vector for further rank manipulation in autocomplete, though. The changes to search sorting are pretty straightforward. Google's had some problems in the past with sites manipulating how they appear on results. After all, anything that's governed by a set of rules can be gamed using those rules. Even without that Google's had some problems with factually inaccurate results appearing on top of results. They'll be making new changes to ranking to avoid that sort of thing in the future, and they're redoubling their efforts with Google's human oversight in determining quality of results. Their content policy has been updated with the details, and their educational portal on how their Search works has also been changed. Until we see how searches are changed there's no way to know if the new tools might open another means for manipulation of results. While it's possible some might use it as a means of censorship or calumny, hopefully the system is robust enough to resist that type of manipulation. Either way, we shall see.

Luciano Damn, MJ was spot on. He said you're coming and here you are! F4LL0U7 Well yesterday's March For Science post is a pretty good indication of how this comment section is about to play out... M. Luciano I must have missed it - wtf is controversial about supporting science? F4LL0U7 A lot, apparently! Check it out. http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/04/24/went-protest-app/#comment-3271548575 Sir_Brizz I think it's wrong to simplify both the "March for Science" and whatever happened in that comments section to "supporting science". Most people would agree with "supporting science" but it is rarely that simple. If you don't understand what problem a reasonably intelligent person would have had with the march or that post, then that probably warrants further investigation on your part to form your own opinions. M. Luciano I was surprised to hear that there was any controversy over the march for science. Science seems like one of the most uncontroversial things one could "march" for. The article didn't mention any controversy, unless people creating an app to collect data at protests is controversial, but then almost every app on every platform would be controversial. Nicholas Conrad It wasn't a march for science, it was just called a march for science. It was a march in support of a particular set of policy prescriptions. Anyone who really supports science would know that science can't be in favor of one policy or another, it can only inform the discussion of costs and benefits of varying policies which then have to be weighed. M. Luciano Furthermore, a Google search for "March for Science Controversy" turns up no controversy. Just a bunch of articles explaining who and what is going on. Is there an actual controversy? People supporting the scientific method and it's application to the challenges of our current world and society... that's not controversial. Nicholas Conrad Clearly a media conspiracy; is mj lamestream? MJ The first of the manipulated BLOCKED!

Sir_Brizz I presume by "these kinds of people" you mean CNN, right? Christopher Glass I mean YOU. Nicholas Conrad I mean, but clearly you also from that response, so.... madcanada You're precisely the reason why the fight is useless. You will simply believe whatever mainstream media tells you is true. Why bother if you standard of quality is mainstream media? Vivek Rameses So they're censoring what the govt doesn't agree with? Is this new China? FernandoRocker No. Just made in China. M. Luciano What? No. The government isn't mentioned, at all and that's not how it works. They're 1) Not censoring anything and 2) Trying to promote accuracy in search results Vivek Rameses If I were to use Google at least I won't see any CNN, Fox news and the likes. That would be a plus. rebretz000 I think the fact that a tool like this is needed is biggest problem. I can't believe that there are persons out there so gullible that they will believe almost anything posted online. Averix A lot of people don't cross check articles and only read headlines. Sites that base their existence off of ad revenue by getting people into a "click hole" of fake news stories have the psychology of morons figured out. David Warthen We must get rid of the fake news so you can be inundated with all the real news that's completely made up. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ As long as I can filter out /r/the_donald I think that will take care of the majority of it. F4LL0U7 Heads up, a handful of users you've never seen on AP before are about to rain their barely literate rantings upon you. As an example, check out the March For Science post from yesterday. A Person People who attend science marches only push their belief in science when it suits their interests, not when it comes to male is male and female is female. M. Luciano Did that make sense when you wrote it? A Person Yes, it makes sense. M. Luciano What exactly is the scientific understanding of the relationships between sex and gender? We could try sociological, biological and psychological. Let us know when you're ready to read up on the hundreds of peer reviewed studies and provide an analysis. F4LL0U7 People who say things like that have likely never had a child, relative, or friend who turned out to be trans. And even if you haven't, why not try having a little empathy? Life might be more enjoyable, and you might be less angry at things that have absolutely no impact on you whatsoever. A Person That is very selfish of you to enforce others believe or acknowledge something simply because you yourself have experienced. If you have a friend, child, or relative that thinks they should have been the opposite sex, and you didn't attempt to get them psychiatric help, then you dropped the ball. F4LL0U7 I'm sure I should just block you and end this waste of time, but I'll ask anyway: do you think homosexuals need psychiatric help as well, or do you think that's a valid way for a person to live their life? A Person I'm sorry, do all homosexuals think you can switch back and forth between male or female, or whatever other gender you want to make up? If that is the case, then we can talk. I see "other person typing"... but sorry, I'm out... you people are batsh!t crazy. fijisiv Dude keep it up. I have never seen somebody so proud of their ignorance! Is it painful to watch? Is it sad? Is it humorous? Yes. F4LL0U7 Really? Never? (Had to bring it all back around to Devin's OP) https://az616578.vo.msecnd.net/files/responsive/embedded/any/desktop/2016/07/30/636055042891058227364682665_2.jpg Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Kudos to you and @disqus_DIvkrvAJjQ:disqus for attempting to educate @disqus_abcdefg:disqus, but sadly it seems they would rather hide in their little hole and pretend the world is black and white. F4LL0U7 You'd have to take a survey. But I would bet that most of them would be open to modern science, empathy, and leaving people the hell alone. That question was just a litmus test for your level of tolerance to other humans that may or may not fall into your perfect worldview. Sir_Brizz I'll vote for leaving people alone, although that is something that is rarely afforded to others. Nathan Walters You're the one refusing to acknowledge empirical evidence and human experience. Pot, meet kettle. MJ Holy Crap! I could have sworn that I BLOCKED (fixed) you long ago. Dude, stop with your endless ignorant comments. You have never said anything resembling intelligence on any subject here. Are people really this dumb or are most of them actually just trolls? Impossible to tell or know I guess... F4LL0U7 If you're out, does that mean you're not coming back, and I don't have to bother blocking you? Nathan Walters Wait, do you even know what science has to say about issues of biological sex? I'm guessing not. A Person Science says there are two genders, not Facebook's 58... or whatever count they're up to now. F4LL0U7 Sure, if the most recent science book you've read is the bible. A Person LOL... I haven't said anything about the bible. You're a guy or a girl and whatever logic you want to make up in order to twist two genders into 50+... well, let me get my popcorn. M. Luciano This is just as false as it was 4 minutes ago. Most people are a guy or a girl or both, but some are neither. F4LL0U7 I'll refer you to @disqus_DIvkrvAJjQ:disqus's post above, since they've already done the research, and I have to get back to work. M. Luciano You're wrong. "Science" holds 8 known sexes and three known genders. The sexes are X0, XX, XY, ZZ, ZW, WW, Hermaphrodite and asexual. The genders are male, female and neuter. This does not include chromosomal anomalies, such as XXY, XXYY, X and XXX. A Person lol... This is like if I were to argue that "tires can only be round", so your argument becomes "round isn't the only shape". M. Luciano No, it's as if you said, "people are male or female" and then I stated that the scientific understanding is that people are one of eight sexes and one of three genders. Because that's what actually happened. So you were incorrect because you were ignorant of the actual information available to you, now that you have it, you can learn. A Person Dude, I brought up gender and you brought up sex. Why do SJWs like yourself feel it necessary to complicate things as much as possible? M. Luciano You used them interchangeably with Nathan Walters, so figured you wanted to know that they're different. But even if you want to stick to gender only, there are 3, not 2. A Person I didn't use them interchangeably. I brought up gender. He then brought up sex. I didn't bring up sex. This is ridiculous. M. Luciano He brought up sex, you then referred to it as gender ... either way, 3 > 2. And either way, it has absolutely nothing to do with the overall topic of search results. F4LL0U7 The world is complicated, dude. And if something as simple as rethinking your pronouns can make life a little less complicated for people who are having a hard enough time as it is, then why not do it? In your mind, is being a Social Justice Warrior a bad thing? Seems like fighting for social justice is something to be proud of. F4LL0U7 More accurately, it's as if you said "tires are the only things that allow vehicles to move" and then @disqus_DIvkrvAJjQ:disqus cited tank treads, skis, wings, and propellors as other examples. A Person You're right, he/she/ze/it/them/they sounds even crazier when you put it that way. F4LL0U7 Maybe this concept wouldn't be so difficult for you if you spoke another language. Most other languages besides English have gender-neutral pronouns. If English did, then maybe you wouldn't be so offended by having to consider someone's gender identity before referring to them. Nathan Walters There aren't even only 2 sexes, why should the existence of more genders come as any surprise?

Because diversity of thought is like fascist and stuff. C Lo What could possibly go wrong... Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Bahahahahaha! As if I trust Google. I tried this myself with Google vs. Duckduckgo, searching for "Hillary Clinton is a". The results for Google have changed slightly, but they're still flattering. Duckduckgo still suggests criminal, liar, crook, murderer, etc. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/50818a751a00330950eceeca37a2b4d6b8f74ee8691ca9854e4ade9962a6264e.jpg F4LL0U7 Try that with any person in Google and you'll see the same discrepancy. Google already explained this (several months ago, welcome to the party!). They don't associate people's names with negative words in autocomplete. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ That's funny, because I get "Donald Trump is a" cheeto, dinosaur, democrat (now THAT is an insult) on Google. In fact, I get a lot of insulting suggestions for other people. "Bill O'Reilly is a" wife beater? So your explanation does not pass the smell test. F4LL0U7 You won't get suggestions about Trump being a liar (despite video evidence) or a crook (despite him settling out of court for defrauding attendees of his "university"). Google simply does not suggest terms like that. Here's an idea -- Google it. It was in the news almost a year ago. Doby Gillis Seems you need to look up safe space since you're acting like a special, little, snowflake. Bruce Wayne Google is notoriously liberal so it's no surprise that they suppress negative comments about a liberal former presidential candidate and boost negative comments about a Republican president. I just looked up "Hillary Clinton is a..." and I got democrat, war hawk, hologram and hero. I did the same for Trump and got dinosaur, cheeto, gemini etc. And Google expects us to trust them with filtering for "fake news". HA! Scott Will the Google App get search tools?? D.Smithee How about they combat the absolute deluge of fake reviews in the Play Store. Geezus.

Google posts truly incredible night images captured by the Pixel and Nexus 6P Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/25 11:28am PDTApr 25, 2017 52 Plus 1 on G+ 362 Share on Facebook 96 Share on Twitter Total Shares510 Google News Nexus 6P Pixel Pixel XL Smartphone cameras have come a long way, but can you ever take images that rival a "real" camera? According to Google software engineer Florian Kainz, the answer is yes. Using a custom camera app and some post-capture editing , Kainz shows what the camera sensors in the Pixel and Nexus 6P can do in low light situations. Kainz says his little project was inspired by a chat with Google's Gcam team, which focuses on computational photography. The most visible Gcam contribution to Google's products is HDR+, which allows phones like the Pixel to take photos in dim lighting by combining as many as 10 burst shots. HDR+ isn't perfect, though. Sometimes there just isn't enough light to produce a good image. 64 4-second exposures, shot with Nexus 6P With long exposures and lots of individual images, Kainz reasoned it should be possible to get much better photos out of a smartphone's tiny camera sensor. To test this, he built a simple camera app with manual control over exposure time, ISO, and focus distance. The image at the top of the Point Reyes Lighthouse at night was Kainz's first test. This is a composite of 32 frames at 4-second exposure and ISO 1600, taken with the Nexus 6P. He also covered the lens and captured 32 completely black frames. The RAW image files were exported to Photoshop, where the mean of all 32 photos was computed, then the mean of the 32 black frames was subtracted. Below you can see what one of the individual HDR+ photos looked like. Impressive, no? A single 6P HDR+ frame Kainz did more tests with a variety of editing tricks, which you can read about in the full post. Below are some of the photos taken with the Pixel, but that phone only supports maximum 2-second exposures. Kainz speculates that a longer exposures could allow even better low-light photos on smartphones, assuming the subject is not moving and you have a tripod. Amusingly, the Pixel photos were taken in June and July last year, long before the phone was announced. 64 2-second exposures, shot with Google Pixel Many of the editing tweaks used to produce these images could be automated, too. You could imagine an app for Android or a mode in the camera that does most of this for you. Of course, the processing time for a few dozen RAW files would be rather lengthy on a phone. Maybe it could be built into Google Photos? If you want to see more photos from Kainz's experiments, there's a Google Photos album. 64 2-second exposures, shot with Pixel Source: Google Research Tags camera Google google research hdr nexus 6p photography pixel research subscribe ...

Random! Also, fucking skills of whoever is doing all the post processing in these pics. This ain't special about the Pixel and 6P after all, this post processing algorithm could be applied to any phone's pics. madcanada Any pics. Including a DSLR and night sky shots. Gonna try this weekend. shutUface 6p hdr post processing is really good. Throw the photos in snapseed for a little effect. Ocepi https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/63d92d20e4febf4677fb9a1dbbdd2230d3563bf5f95c0c065225af6ddf0baf25.jpg Milton P. This, I need this in my life!!! I'm dying for long exposure option in my phone. ChronoReverse The Htc 10 hardware can do stuff like this already. Here's a 900 second exposure: https://www.flickr.com/photos/maik_reifschneider/29419144492/ HebeGuess same sensors IMX377 as 5X/6P, different optics (with OIS). Pink tint at lower right corner was IR bleed from Laser Autofocus. James Doyle 64 pictures was all they could take before the 6P immediately shut down, probably while the battery read 35%. Snark aside, at this point I think maybe it's too soon to automate something like this on the phone itself, but this would be an amazing thing that Google Photos's AI could automate for us. David Ruddock Exactly. If you could use a stabilizer/tripod and upload the photos to the cloud. That would be nuts. James Doyle I'm almost there for just HDR+. A half dozen HDR+ images all trying to process brings my phone to a crawl, meaning I can't take any more pictures. Let's calm down the processing until I've stopped taking pics, or offload the work to the cloud. jonzey231 Yep. Totally agree with this statement. Once you've got a pretty dark photo trying to process or two decent images trying to process at once, the phone is basically a brick for the next 30 seconds. TSS TS 'The Cloud' doesn't work that way - Cloud based technologies fall under xaaS (IaaS/SaaS/DaaS) - The most common application is DaaS - Which is the only cloud space Google offers to residential consumers. Even if Google created an IaaS product scope, the limitations of current cell protocols would never allow 'processing' to be handed off to anything. Process threads are computed locally. There is nobody on this planet that has figured out how to parse thread computation over ANY WAN/LAN/Network to a central CPU farm to work out xyz process. The concept would be incredibly inefficient anyways. As the CPU processing the threads would have to process the inbound transaction, process the job, then redistribute back to the client. It would being doing 3-10x the work to say nothing have the transaction congestion, and security issues. Reference : Me, i'm a Sys Engineer/Admin. Toodles. Stuart Anderson His point is they could delay and/or limit the HDR+ work until after he's done taking pictures. And post processing like this doesn't need to be real time anyway. Jake Ashton lol. TSS TS got owned! leave it to the "experts" to think inside the box and just tell people what they can't do. toodles EH101 I think you're misunderstanding. What he means is take the 64 pictures (or 3 for regular HDR), let them all get uploaded as you normally would when you hit wifi, then let Google Photos online do the work to make the final picture. Not let the 'cloud' process something that stays on the device in real time. Google already does this to an extent, letting Google Photos 'read' the images and group them by face etc. Sean Buckman I'm using google pixel and I just keep shooting with no lag. It takes a bit(around 5-10 seconds) after taking the pictures to process the HDR+ but it doesn't slow the phone down. Matt I wonder how long it would take to upload 64 RAW files to the cloud... whispy_snippet With Australia's internet speeds I estimate 231 years and six days. Winston What are you talking about? I was there last year and loved the speeds I could get on LTE. But then again I was on Telstra... whispy_snippet I'm on Telstra too but I wasn't referring to cellular data speeds.

JohnyNoLegs It's like Google don't care about features. Like they think people will be happy with the most basic of applications. 2kool4skool ✓ⱽᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵇʸ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Google dumbed-down their apps to be as simple and as barebone as possible because apparently there are people that are scared with having options. These are the same people that call any phone or app that offers more than basic features as "gimmicks". JohnyNoLegs Completely agree. For some reason, there has always been a market for this. Feels to me it's for people who either don't do that much on their phone, or like buying third party apps for some reason. Tom Harman While I like my pixel, I'll stick to my D800e for 99% of my photos. madcanada Lol, I have a Canon 6D and I stick to Nexus 6P for 99% of my photos :D Patrick Comparing a 6D and a D800e is like comparing a Polaroid to a Leica. They're different tools for much different uses. That being said, I'm surprised that the Pixel wouldn't take over for the d800e... The simplicity, man! I don't shoot my d800 for anything but photo shoots now because the Pixel is too easy to get great shots and I don't have to spend hours in post. catalysto In the context of comparing to a smartphone, they are practically the same. Trent It's impressive, of course. But to suggest that even the best software will help a Pixel rival a DSLR is comedic. Good enough for most, they are, but put them up on a big screen next to similar shots from even a Nikon D3300 and the lack of pixels (amongst other things) will show which is better. There's also the small matter of all that editing hassle. Naturally, I shoot RAW with my DSLR, but a little time in Lightroom is generally all that's needed to make a shot pop. I appreciate that I'm being a little over-the-top in my condemnation, image quality/rivaling "real" cameras is about more than just how good something looks on a smartphone display. It's about being able to zoom in without a major loss of quality and casting the image to a TV and it not looking bad at that size. I do like my Pixel very much and it's great for casual shots. A DSLR replacement it is not, however. David Ruddock I think this is mostly about the power of light-gathering and composite HDR even when in use even with a tiny sensor. It bodes well for the future of algorithmic photography if nothing else - as sensors get better and algorithms do, too, we can keep pushing the limits of these already impressive methods. This example just takes it to an extreme as a showcase. madcanada This article is about the algorithm. You can apply the same process to a DSLR image making night sky shots even better. OhYeah! This is basicly only due to the Photo stacking technique. You can tell from the single image that each photo is pretty terrible but once you median stack the photos it can average out all the noise. You could create a photo that looked pretty great from a Galaxy S 3 if you really wanted to. madcanada Yes, that's what I said. OhYeah! Yep you kind of did in a different way. Good job, you can recognize similarities! TechGuy22 yet no one can buy the pixel thank god i was able to sell my 6p for 500 bucks and bought the xl rjyanj "no one can buy the pixel" "i bought the xl" hmm. TechGuy22 https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel_phone?hl=en-US can you buy it there ? that's what i meant dumb ass. i have an XL too. didn't buy it from google. nxtiak XL: Black 32gb and 128gb ships May 4th. Silver 32gb, available now, 128gb 3-4weeks. So Yes? Non XL are all out of stock. Shawn Spring I did the same, dumped the 6P after I had preordered the Pixel XL on launch day. Boy am I glad I did. Stevie_Wonder Shooting RAW (DNG) and manual exposure. Google just told us what we are missing from the Google Camera app. Thank you Google, but we knew that already. Mihai Ionescu What Manual camera app do you reccomend? WittyPixel a post that I made a while back in the 6p XDA forums, enjoy! https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-6p/themes-apps/nexus-6p-manual-camera-recommendations-t3340090 Lizzie McVeigh Adobe's Light Room Camera. You get full control of settings... up to 0.7" of exposure. Random! We desperately need that app you've mentioned, with manual controls for exposure time, aperture and ISO. Scott Olsen There's plenty of them already. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.flavionet.android.camera.pro Mike Or just get any phone that isn't developed by Google. My name is…. the smart choice martesque Like say, the LG V20 camera app. Defenestratus Took this picture on my old Nexus 6P of my neighbor's house the other day while walking the pooch. Moon was right behind the light house. the picture is pretty grainy but still pretty impressive given how dark it was outside (even though it doesn't look like it in the picture, I think Google Photos messed with the settings a bit) https://goo.gl/photos/1VBuUKxRGC7Dutyh7 Rod URL not found Ahamid17 Its a shame I had to give up my 5X for an iPhone because of that boot loop issue other than that I really loved my 5X camera Ahamid17 I would love to see the process in which he combined that 64 and 32 frames to get that result and imagine in the future if your camera app could do that in app instead of doing it on photoshop Tauran This needs to be an automated processing trick on Google photos. HDR is great but people like me don't have time to process photos manually to look this great. WittyPixel Salty post... "This is a composite of 32 frames at 4-second exposure and ISO 1600, taken with the Nexus 6P" realizing google didn't unlock all the capabilities he builds an apps to do so. If google allowed apps to use the sensor to it's full capability then we could do the same and the camera would be truly amazing. Gjorgi Lazarovski I don't get what you're saying but the Camera2 API that's in Android since Lollipop allows this and is fully enabled on both phones. You just need the right app, like Manual Camera from the Play store for example. With a tripod and set of skills in Photoshop you're most likely to get the same results by yourself. Kyle Gospodnetich The Pixel and 6P camera drivers are limited to 2 second exposures max. There are many other phones from other manufacturers that can have much, much longer exposure times set via the Camera2 API. funky There is also a hack on xda to support longer exposures, I guess 4 sec WittyPixel future reference... link or it doesn't exist. and there is not one for the nexus 6p, fyi. WittyPixel camera 2 API does not allow that feature. bobinchicago Hey, my Nexus 6P would take great shots too if the battery life wasn't down to an hour and plunging down to 0 the moment I open the camera app. VAVAMk_2 Get a replacement battery dblock I honestly think even the 6P has a better camera than the S8+. I have only had the phone less than a week, but thus far it seems like the camera just isn't as good, back or front camera for that matter. And it may not be the sensors themselves, but perhaps the software. The Google Camera on the Nexus/Pixel devices is just too damn good. JohnyNoLegs Blind tests put the S8 on almost equal footing of the Pixel. It's all in the software. Hence why it takes so long to process images after you take them. Klugschwaetzer Mhh. I'm wondering why I see no star trails after 2 minutes. Stars should not be round, but elongated. Since they are quite round, it seems that this Mr. Kainz has adjusted for earth's motion somehow. But then the branches of the trees should be blurry. Very strange indeed. ChicagoPete I hope you've taken the last 12 minutes to read the source post for this article. Klugschwaetzer I have. Have you? 64 images with two second exposure each means that not counting an intervall between shots you look at the sky for over 128 seconds. The stars will have moved by that time making a virtual overexposure very difficult. Unless he somehow compensated for that. But I don't see how he could have done that - as I said before. Klugschwaetzer Just read the source article. Thanks for pointing that out. jwildman16 Two seconds, not minutes. NinoBr0wn I've given up hope for Google to update their camera app to something above a passing grade. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good strategy by Google to do night pictures. That minimizes the chance of getting halos in the Pixel pictures. whispy_snippet Haven't you already been completely burnt in a camera debate that forced you to leave the discussion without a reply?

A report published Monday by the cybersecurity firm revealed the attack, dubbed FalseGuide, which has managed to upload malicious code into a number of apps that were available through the Google Play Store, Google’s official marketplace for apps. Read: Gooligan, Google Malware: One Million Android Devices And Counting Infected Check Point said the oldest instance of FalseGuide was found uploaded to the Google Play Store on Feb. 17. In a matter of just over two months, the malware has found its way onto more than 600,000 devices. The malware was spread through a number of apps that presented themselves as guides for popular mobile games, including Pokémon Go, FIFA, World of Tanks and a number of LEGO titles. Some of the individual guides reached as many as 50,000 installs. Check Point alerted Google about the issue and said the company promptly removed the infected apps from the Google Play Store. Another round of apps containing the FalseGuide attack appeared in April and were quickly squashed. Read: 36 Android Devices Come With Malware Preinstalled The FalseGuide malware attempted to turn infected phones into a makeshift botnet that allowed the attackers to control the devices without the knowledge of the device owners. FalseGuide would request administrative permissions to the device, then would register itself with Firebase Cloud Messaging, a messaging service that allows developers to send notifications and messages. From there, the attacker could send malware that would be installed on the infected device. That malware would be used to display illegitimate advertisements that would generate revenue for the attackers. The attackers could also inject highly malicious code into an infected phone to root the device, conduct a DDoS attack or penetrate private networks. Check Point has provided a full list of malicious apps, which Android users may want to reference. Despite the apps being pulled from the Google Play Store, they are likely still active on devices, leaving users still prone to attack.

Anytime. Anywhere. Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com FCA, Google Begin Offering Rides in Self-Driving Cars By Dee-Ann Durbin PUBLISHED: APRIL 25 2017 Fiat Chrysler and Google for the first time will offer rides to the public in the self-driving vehicles they are building under an expanding partnership. The companies announced in the spring of last year that they would build 100 self-driving Chrysler Pacifica hybrids minivans. Those vehicles have been tested in Arizona, California and Michigan. Waymo, Google's self-driving car project, said Tuesday that it will allow hundreds of people in Phoenix to take rides in the vehicles so that it can get feedback on the experience. Phoenix-area residents can apply on Waymo's website. The company also said that it's expanding its fleet to 500 Pacifica hybrids. Waymo -- created by Google in 2009 -- has given rides to the public before in its hometown of Mountain View, California. In 2015, it let a blind man ride around Austin, Texas, in one of its completely self-driving pods. The Phoenix program will be much larger in scale, and it will be the first to use the Pacifica minivans [pictured above]. Waymo isn't the first to put regular passengers in self-driving cars in the race to develop the technology. Ride-hailing company Uber has had self-driving Volvos on the road in Pittsburgh since last fall. Boston startup nuTonomy is giving taxi rides to passengers in Singapore and Boston. In all cases, there is a backup driver behind the wheel. Waymo said it wants to learn where people want to go in a self-driving vehicle, how they communicate with it and what kinds of information and controls they want. Fiat Chrysler builds the Pacifica minivan in Windsor, Canada, just across the border from Detroit. It adds Waymo's self-driving software and hardware, including sensors and cameras, at a facility in Michigan. Fiat Chrysler's U.S. headquarters is in Auburn Hills, Michigan. "This collaboration is helping both companies learn how to bring self-driving cars to market, and realize the safety and mobility benefits of this technology," said Waymo chief John Krafcik in a company release. Michelle Krebs, an executive analyst for the car shopping site Autotrader, says studies have shown that a majority of Americans are still reluctant to ride in a fully self-driving car. Opening Waymo's vehicles to the public will help build riders' confidence, she said. "The key to acceptance is exposure and education," she said. Ultimately, Waymo says, self-driving cars could prevent many of the 1.2 million deaths that occur on worldwide roads each year. Waymo has made clear that it intends to form partnerships with automakers and not build its own self-driving cars. It's also in talks with Honda Motor Co. about a potential collaboration. © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media. All rights reserved. Image credit: Google/Waymo.

T-Mobile Wins Big in Airwaves Auction Next Article > As More Buy Clothes Online, Walmart Eyes a Piece of the Action By Edward Helmore PUBLISHED: APRIL 25 2017 "Founded on Fit, Focused on Style, Built on Service" -- that's the retail promise offered by Bonobos, the men's e-tailing business that's being courted by Walmart and idolized by the garment industry as a model for reviving US retail woes. The $300m acquisition of the chain, which has more than two dozen stores or "guideshops" in key cities like Chicago, New York and Atlanta, is likely to be announced imminently, according to industry sources. If the deal is confirmed it will not only place Bonobos 38-year-old co-founder and CEO Andy Dunn at the forefront of Walmart's online clothing battle with Amazon, but will endorse a hybrid online/bricks-and-mortar vision some hope can be retail's future. US high streets are witnessing a Darwinian winnowing. In recent months hundreds of closures have been announced as retailers including Macy's, Sears, American Apparel and Abercrombie & Fitch have scaled back their bricks and mortar operations in the face of a shift to online shopping. Bonobos offers an alternative. It operates a small number of stores that act as fitting rooms but do not to fulfill orders on site, only from distribution centers. Their locations carry no inventory -- customers try on its slim-fitting, fashion conscious clothes -- ranging from T-shirts and jeans to business suits and black-tie -- for fit and style, and then have their acquisitions shipped to their home from a central warehouse. The stores are as much advertisement as sales floor. Most of Bonobos's sales are done online by people who may never have visited one of their stores. It's an e-tailing hybrid that's become popular with men, who, broadly observed, do not enjoy shopping or require the same level of consideration as their counterparts. "I always hated shopping. It wasn't fun, even for me. But here I just want to buy out the store," said 28-year-old medical student Philip Maynard, outside a Bonobos guide-shop on 5th Avenue in Lower Manhattan. Maynard said it didn't matter to him that he couldn't walk out with his purchases. "They have a good business online, and the stuff comes when they say its going to come, and I've never had a problem returning anything." Bonobos, which was founded in 2007, established its reputation as retailer with jeans and chinos. After several rounds of investment, sales are reported to be around $100m, up from $40m in 2012. The model addresses the online retailers problem of consumers not being able to try on clothes before they buy them, and the traditional retailers issue of delivering good service. As Dunn told Business of Fashion in 2013, he'd worked at Abercrombie & Fitch folding sweaters. "You're basically the inventory manager of the store, being marginally helpful to the customers. It's more of a job about keeping clothes folded than it is about delivering service." Bonobos true innovation may be challenging the belief that the instant gratification of walking out with a purchase is key to the retail experience. "It's not," Dunn said. "It's has been astonishing how little our customer cares." The concept started as a Stanford MBA project involving Dunn and co-founder Brian Spaly with the goal to provide men with better-fitting clothes, and specifically to design and produce chinos that eliminate "Khaki Diaper Butt." Dunn recognized it could be the internet company he was looking for. As he told Coverteur : "Sometimes the future is rooted in the past, which is sort of counter-intuitive. If you think about old school menswear, it was about the tailor around the corner and that one-to-one relationship you had with that person. We are bringing that back." They started with a show room in New York, followed by a 500 sq ft store in Boston. Dunn realized they'd hit on something. "All of a sudden, it was like, this is it, it's going to be these small, service-driven experiential stores where you have one-on-one service and where you keep out the complexity of a lot of inventory, but you can access this incredibly wide assortment." In lower Manhattan, a store associate explained that by not worrying about back of house stuff like inventory they can focus on customer service. "If you're fitted for one suit, then your measurements are good for all out different suits. That makes it easier -- they get sized once and don't have to come back in unless they want to. Customers may stop by every few weeks and get a couple of things, or the men who come in once a season and we just wardrobe them." But, she cautioned, the system might not necessarily work for women, whose requirements around style and color and sizing are more intricate and nuanced. Nor will the Bonobos model solve the retail sector's larger problems, which accounts for around one in 10 American jobs, or the blight affecting the US main street or its declining system of shopping malls. Since October, more than 89,000 retail positions have been lost. According to some estimates, the sector is on track to lose more stores this year than during the great recession of 2008, its problems accelerating even as a consumer confidence is high and unemployment low, suggesting the changes are systemic and not cyclical. But the Bonobos deal illustrates the accelerating arms race between Amazon, valued at $423bn, and Walmart, valued at $222bn. Wall Street might love Amazon more but the Arkansas-based retailer far exceeds Amazon in earnings -- $13.6bn last year to Amazon's $2.4bn -- and it is aggressively expanding its online businesses. Last September, Walmart completed a $3.3bn acquisition of the discount and deals-driven shopping site Jet.com. It has gone on to pay $70m for footwear online retailer ShoeBuy and $51m for outdoor e-tailer Moosejaw, and agreed the acquisition of Modcloth, a vintage-inspired womenswear producer. Jet.com founder Marc Lore, now president and chief executive officer of Walmart's e-commerce arm, rationalized that smaller brands would gain visibility on the larger platforms. "So suddenly what was a certain size business now, overnight, becomes that much bigger," he told WWD. Amazon, meanwhile, has been pumping up its high-end online offerings, making deals with brands including Levi Strauss & Co. Meanwhile, "real" shops are suffering. Outside Bonobos of 5th Avenue, Philip Maynard explained that he used to shop at J Crew and Brooks Brothers but had since switched.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google Maps now shows local reviews in your default language By Ida Torres - April 25, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter When you’re visiting a new place and you don’t know where to eat or where to go, you probably take a look at the reviews of restaurants or other places, and one of the apps where you can do that is Google Maps. But oftentimes, the reviews people put in the local places are probably in their own language. The days of copy pasting to translate it are over as the app now shows the local reviews in your default language. Previously, if you were curious about the reviews you could not understand, you would select the text, copy it and paste onto Google Translate or whatever translation app you used. Google is removing a few steps in the process by automatically translating the reviews into the language that you’ve set on your device. You will also be able to see the review in the native language under it, just in case the powers or Translate have failed (as is sometimes the case) and you can ask a native speaker to translate it more accurately. This is a pretty useful feature for those who like exploring new places or traveling and then figuring out where to go in a specific area or neighborhood. While of course you have things like Trip Advisor and blogs to check out reviews, if you’re a fan of the whole Google eco-system, then this will be an easier way to check out if the place or restaurant is worth going to. The update is rolling out to Google Maps users so check it out if it’s already available for you by going to the Google Play page.

Fiat Chrysler and Google said Tuesday, April 25, 2017, for the first time will offer rides to the public in the self-driving automobiles they are building under an expanding partnership. (AP Photo/Carlos Osorio, File) Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) Detroit • Fiat Chrysler and Google for the first time will offer rides to the public in the self-driving vehicles they are building under an expanding partnership. Waymo, Google's self-driving car project, said Tuesday it's adding 500 Chrysler Pacifica hybrid minivans to its self-driving vehicle fleet. It will allow hundreds of people in the Phoenix area to take rides in the vehicles so it can get feedback on the experience. Phoenix-area residents could apply on Waymo's website starting Tuesday. The vehicles will also pick up riders in Chandler, Tempe, Mesa and Gilbert, Waymo said. All of the vehicles will have Waymo backup drivers who can take over in an emergency. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Fiat Chrysler and Waymo have been partners since last spring, when they announced they would build 100 self-driving Pacifica hybrids minivans. Those vehicles were delivered to Waymo in December. The companies have been testing the vehicles in Arizona, California and Michigan. Waymo began offering a small number of public rides in Arizona two months ago before deciding to expand the program, a spokesman said. Waymo — created by Google in 2009 — has given rides to the public before in its hometown of Mountain View, California. In 2015, it let a blind man ride around Austin, Texas, in one of its completely self-driving pods. The Phoenix program will be much larger in scale, and it will be the first to use the Pacifica minivans. Waymo isn't the first to put regular passengers in self-driving cars in the race to develop the technology. Ride-hailing company Uber has had self-driving Volvos on the road in Pittsburgh since last fall. Boston startup nuTonomy is giving taxi rides to passengers in Singapore and Boston. In all cases, there is a backup driver behind the wheel. Waymo said it wants to learn where people want to go in a self-driving vehicle, how they communicate with it and what kinds of information and controls they want. Fiat Chrysler builds the Pacifica minivan in Windsor, Canada, just across the border from Detroit. It adds Waymo's self-driving software and hardware, including sensors and cameras, at a facility in Michigan. Fiat Chrysler's U.S. headquarters is in Auburn Hills, Michigan. "This collaboration is helping both companies learn how to bring self-driving cars to market, and realize the safety and mobility benefits of this technology," said Waymo chief John Krafcik in a company release. Michelle Krebs, an executive analyst for the car shopping site Autotrader, says studies have shown that a majority of Americans are still reluctant to ride in a fully self-driving car. Opening Waymo's vehicles to the public will help build riders' confidence, she said. "The key to acceptance is exposure and education," she said. Ultimately, Waymo says, self-driving cars could prevent many of the 1.2 million deaths that occur on worldwide roads each year. Waymo has made clear that it intends to form partnerships with automakers and not build its own self-driving cars. It's also in talks with Honda Motor Co. about a potential collaboration.   Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY VIEW PHOTO GALLERY JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES Utah Jazz seize control, beat Clippers 96-92 to take 3-2 series lead Monson: Jazz now are thiiiiiiiiiiiis close to something extraordinary In major reversal, U. reinstates fired Huntsman Cancer Institute CEO Alleged polygamist Winston Blackmore told police he didn't know wife was 15 years old Man admits to murdering 16-year-old Utah girl in 1977 Contests and Promotions COMMENTS POST A COMMENT      () News All Local News Search Last 36 hours Nation + World RSS Twitter Environment Politics Justice Polygamy Education Weather Traffic Utah's Right Elevate Empower Utah Cool Stuff The Legacy of Joe Hill I Love videos Whatever Happened To...

You can do this using a free Firefox add-on, named as “FoxyImage“. This add-on lets you rotate any image of a webpage to left or right. Apart from that, you can also flip image vertically and horizontally. Firefox and other browsers don’t support this feature natively, but using this add-on, rotating the images on a webpage in Firefox is very easy. You can rotate or flip one image at a time. The best part of this add-on is that it also works on Google Image search results. You can rotate thumbnail of any image as well as click on image thumbnail and then rotate the image within Google Image search. Sponsored Links The recording above shows how easy it is to rotate image on a webpage in Firefox. Do note that images are not rotated permanently. As soon as you refresh the webpage or close and re-open the same webpage, the images are visible in the original orientation. In the screenshot below, you can see thumbnail of an image rotated in Google Image Search results using this add-on. How to Rotate Image on a Webpage in Firefox? This add-on is simple and doesn’t need any configuration after installation. You can use this link to go to its homepage and then install it. Unlike most of the other Firefox add-ons, it doesn’t add any icon on the address bar. Now go to a webpage or article. After that, right-click on an image. You will see that FoxyImage option is visible in right-click context menu. This option will be visible only when you are right-clicking on an image, and not the webpage. Click on that option and you will see: Rotate left. Rotate right. Flip Vertical. Flip Horizontal. Reset (to reset the angle of rotated or flipped image). Open image in new tab. All the options are self-explanatory. Select rotate left or right option and image will be rotated. In a similar way, using flip vertical or horizontal option will flip the image. Whenever you want to view images with default view mode, you can either use Reset option or refresh the tab. You may also check Add Download Button to Instagram Video to Download to PC In Firefox and Extend Firefox Settings To Apply Extra Tweaks. The Verdict: I really like this image rotating add-on. This is quite helpful when rotation angle of an image available on a webpage is not correct. Simply right-clicking the image and the rotate option of this add-on will help you rotate that image for you. No need to first download the image, then open it in some image editor and set its angle. Try this add-on. Get this add-on.

Google will try to combat fake news using search and user feedback Search giant joins fight against "offensive or clearly misleading content." Mark Hachman (PC World (US online)) on 26 April, 2017 04:34 0 - - - - print email Google might not be as responsible for the spread of fake news as social media, but the search giant is still doing something about it: burying known sources of fake news, and letting users weigh in, too. Google frequently tweaks the algorithms that return relevant search results, sometimes privately, and other times publicly. In this case, Google announced Tuesday that about 0.25 percent of all daily search results have been returning “offensive or clearly misleading content,” and those results will be pushed lower in search results in favor of more authoritative results. Google is also implementing Feedback links for users to report on the accuracy of autocomplete search queries and Featured Snippet text. Deliberately misleading information, as well as outright fabrications, plagued the 2016 U.S. presidential primary season and election. Numerous sources found that sites purporting to be legitimate news services were simply making up “news” stories for profit, or as propaganda, and sharing them on social media sites like Facebook. Politicians on both sides used “fake news” as a rallying cry, and studies, such as this one from Stanford University, found that students were increasingly unable to tell the difference between a legitimate news story and a fabricated one. The problem, according to Google, is that 15 percent of all daily searches are brand new. Google can easily know the answer to a query like “Is the earth flat?” But if it’s a query the search engine hasn’t seen before, it has fewer sources of context to rely on. Google What Google’s feedback will look like for autosuggested searches. Why this matters: Google’s efforts should be applauded, but it’s unclear what difference this will make in the long run. The problem isn’t so much that users are searching for fake news; it’s that they’re being force-fed a steady diet of propaganda from friends, contacts, and fake-news sites they’ve already bought into. Facebook tried to solve the problem last fall by implementing a verification mechanisms to combat fake news, but it’s not clear that it’s working. Letting users help decide what’s fake, offensive Last fall, Google announced plans to attach a “Fact Check” label to search results, which it began rolling out in April. Fact Check attempts to adjudicate whether the information in question is truly accurate, using sources like Snopes.com. Still, Fact Check was a response to users who were already searching for a given news report or “fact." Google’s latest tweak makes erroneous results harder to find. “We’ve adjusted our signals to help surface more authoritative pages and demote low-quality content, so that issues similar to the Holocaust denial results that we saw back in December are less likely to appear,” Ben Gomes, Google’s vice president of engineering for search, wrote. Google Feedback for Featured Snippets lets users identify possible fake news. That effort will be assisted by what Google calls Search Quality Raters, real people who assess the quality of Google’s search results. While those people don’t affect search results in real time, they do provide feedback on whether the changes to the algorithms are working, Gomes wrote. More direct input from users themselves will come via new Feedback links attached to autocompleted searches and Featured Snippets. These links are tiny, a gray bit of text at the bottom of the autocomplete bar or the snippet itself. Clicking them, however, allows users to provide direct feedback. In the example Google provided, users can mark checkboxes to state whether a suggested search was hateful or sexually explicit. (Google doesn’t allow autocompleted queries to be marked as inaccurate, since they’re presumably questions.) Google’s Featured Snippets evolved as quick synopses of the answers users were searching for, such as when the Leaning Tower of Piza was built. Now users can assess the snippet with anything from “I don’t like this” to “This is harmful, dangerous, or violent” to “This is misleading or inaccurate.” It’s not clear what happens when an autocompleted search or snippet is marked as inaccurate or inoffensive, however. (We’ve reached out to Google, but representatives didn’t immediately respond.) Will Google’s algorithms take over, or will an actual human make the call? Reporting real information as fake could have negative effects, too. As we’ve learned over the past months, “fake news” is often in the eye of the beholder.

Andrew Grant HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 I've had a multifunction printer in the office going on 10 years now. It was a neat bit of kit back in the day -- print, copy, scan, fax -- when printing over WiFi felt a bit like magic. It’s seen better days though and an upgrade’s well overdue. This HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 looks like it ticks all the same boxes: print, copy, scan, and fax. (Really? Does anyone fax anything any more? I guess it's good to know the facility’s there, just in case.) Printing over WiFi is more-or- less standard these days.

Google's new search tools and changes could help combat fake news Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/25 10:37am PDTApr 25, 2017 15 Plus 1 on G+ 23 Share on Facebook 55 Share on Twitter Total Shares93 Google News Since time immemorial (1998) Google's bread, butter, and raison d'être has been search. Now Google's changing the way search works a bit, empowering users by adding new feedback tools and changing results from their search ranking to bring you more relevant and accurate information. With these changes users should see less in the way of so-called "fake news" and other non-factual content (excluding searches for that material), and more accurate and relevant information pertaining to their search. The biggest user-facing change you are likely to see is probably the new feedback link. It allows users to tag snippets —the short bits of text you might see that directly answer questions posed in a search —or autocomplete results as being accurate, inaccurate, offensive, or just disliked. There's no telling yet exactly how Google may or may not use the data collected via reports, but at a minimum it may go some way to prevent a few of the problems they've seen. I know in the past I've seen snippets come up that are either entirely incorrect or totally unrelated to a search. Hopefully this doesn't just present a new vector for further rank manipulation in autocomplete, though. The changes to search sorting are pretty straightforward. Google's had some problems in the past with sites manipulating how they appear on results. After all, anything that's governed by a set of rules can be gamed using those rules. Even without that Google's had some problems with factually inaccurate results appearing on top of results. They'll be making new changes to ranking to avoid that sort of thing in the future, and they're redoubling their efforts with Google's human oversight in determining quality of results. Their content policy has been updated with the details, and their educational portal on how their Search works has also been changed. Until we see how searches are changed there's no way to know if the new tools might open another means for manipulation of results. While it's possible some might use it as a means of censorship or calumny, hopefully the system is robust enough to resist that type of manipulation. Either way, we shall see.

Luciano Damn, MJ was spot on. He said you're coming and here you are! F4LL0U7 Well yesterday's March For Science post is a pretty good indication of how this comment section is about to play out... M. Luciano I must have missed it - wtf is controversial about supporting science? F4LL0U7 A lot, apparently! Check it out. http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/04/24/went-protest-app/#comment-3271548575 Sir_Brizz I think it's wrong to simplify both the "March for Science" and whatever happened in that comments section to "supporting science". Most people would agree with "supporting science" but it is rarely that simple. If you don't understand what problem a reasonably intelligent person would have had with the march or that post, then that probably warrants further investigation on your part to form your own opinions. M. Luciano I was surprised to hear that there was any controversy over the march for science. Science seems like one of the most uncontroversial things one could "march" for. The article didn't mention any controversy, unless people creating an app to collect data at protests is controversial, but then almost every app on every platform would be controversial. Nicholas Conrad It wasn't a march for science, it was just called a march for science. It was a march in support of a particular set of policy prescriptions. Anyone who really supports science would know that science can't be in favor of one policy or another, it can only inform the discussion of costs and benefits of varying policies which then have to be weighed. M. Luciano Furthermore, a Google search for "March for Science Controversy" turns up no controversy. Just a bunch of articles explaining who and what is going on. Is there an actual controversy? People supporting the scientific method and it's application to the challenges of our current world and society... that's not controversial.

Nicholas Conrad I mean, but clearly you also from that response, so.... madcanada You're precisely the reason why the fight is useless.

Is this new China? FernandoRocker No. Just made in China. M. Luciano What? No. The government isn't mentioned, at all and that's not how it works. They're 1) Not censoring anything and 2) Trying to promote accuracy in search results Vivek Rameses If I were to use Google at least I won't see any CNN, Fox news and the likes. That would be a plus. rebretz000 I think the fact that a tool like this is needed is biggest problem. I can't believe that there are persons out there so gullible that they will believe almost anything posted online. Averix A lot of people don't cross check articles and only read headlines. Sites that base their existence off of ad revenue by getting people into a "click hole" of fake news stories have the psychology of morons figured out. David Warthen We must get rid of the fake news so you can be inundated with all the real news that's completely made up. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ As long as I can filter out /r/the_donald I think that will take care of the majority of it. F4LL0U7 Heads up, a handful of users you've never seen on AP before are about to rain their barely literate rantings upon you. As an example, check out the March For Science post from yesterday. A Person People who attend science marches only push their belief in science when it suits their interests, not when it comes to male is male and female is female. M. Luciano Did that make sense when you wrote it? A Person Yes, it makes sense. M. Luciano What exactly is the scientific understanding of the relationships between sex and gender? We could try sociological, biological and psychological. Let us know when you're ready to read up on the hundreds of peer reviewed studies and provide an analysis. F4LL0U7 People who say things like that have likely never had a child, relative, or friend who turned out to be trans. And even if you haven't, why not try having a little empathy? Life might be more enjoyable, and you might be less angry at things that have absolutely no impact on you whatsoever. A Person That is very selfish of you to enforce others believe or acknowledge something simply because you yourself have experienced. If you have a friend, child, or relative that thinks they should have been the opposite sex, and you didn't attempt to get them psychiatric help, then you dropped the ball. F4LL0U7 I'm sure I should just block you and end this waste of time, but I'll ask anyway: do you think homosexuals need psychiatric help as well, or do you think that's a valid way for a person to live their life? A Person I'm sorry, do all homosexuals think you can switch back and forth between male or female, or whatever other gender you want to make up? If that is the case, then we can talk. I see "other person typing"... but sorry, I'm out... you people are batsh!t crazy. fijisiv Dude keep it up. I have never seen somebody so proud of their ignorance! Is it painful to watch? Is it sad? Is it humorous? Yes. F4LL0U7 Really? Never? (Had to bring it all back around to Devin's OP) https://az616578.vo.msecnd.net/files/responsive/embedded/any/desktop/2016/07/30/636055042891058227364682665_2.jpg Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Kudos to you and @disqus_DIvkrvAJjQ:disqus for attempting to educate @disqus_abcdefg:disqus, but sadly it seems they would rather hide in their little hole and pretend the world is black and white. F4LL0U7 You'd have to take a survey. But I would bet that most of them would be open to modern science, empathy, and leaving people the hell alone. That question was just a litmus test for your level of tolerance to other humans that may or may not fall into your perfect worldview. Sir_Brizz I'll vote for leaving people alone, although that is something that is rarely afforded to others. Nathan Walters You're the one refusing to acknowledge empirical evidence and human experience. Pot, meet kettle. MJ Holy Crap! I could have sworn that I BLOCKED (fixed) you long ago. Dude, stop with your endless ignorant comments. You have never said anything resembling intelligence on any subject here. Are people really this dumb or are most of them actually just trolls? Impossible to tell or know I guess... F4LL0U7 If you're out, does that mean you're not coming back, and I don't have to bother blocking you? Nathan Walters Wait, do you even know what science has to say about issues of biological sex? I'm guessing not. A Person Science says there are two genders, not Facebook's 58... or whatever count they're up to now. F4LL0U7 Sure, if the most recent science book you've read is the bible. A Person LOL... I haven't said anything about the bible. You're a guy or a girl and whatever logic you want to make up in order to twist two genders into 50+... well, let me get my popcorn. M. Luciano This is just as false as it was 4 minutes ago. Most people are a guy or a girl or both, but some are neither. F4LL0U7 I'll refer you to @disqus_DIvkrvAJjQ:disqus's post above, since they've already done the research, and I have to get back to work. M. Luciano You're wrong. "Science" holds 8 known sexes and three known genders. The sexes are X0, XX, XY, ZZ, ZW, WW, Hermaphrodite and asexual. The genders are male, female and neuter. This does not include chromosomal anomalies, such as XXY, XXYY, X and XXX. A Person lol... This is like if I were to argue that "tires can only be round", so your argument becomes "round isn't the only shape". M. Luciano No, it's as if you said, "people are male or female" and then I stated that the scientific understanding is that people are one of eight sexes and one of three genders. Because that's what actually happened. So you were incorrect because you were ignorant of the actual information available to you, now that you have it, you can learn. A Person Dude, I brought up gender and you brought up sex. Why do SJWs like yourself feel it necessary to complicate things as much as possible? M. Luciano You used them interchangeably with Nathan Walters, so figured you wanted to know that they're different. But even if you want to stick to gender only, there are 3, not 2. A Person I didn't use them interchangeably. I brought up gender. He then brought up sex. I didn't bring up sex. This is ridiculous. M. Luciano He brought up sex, you then referred to it as gender ... either way, 3 > 2. And either way, it has absolutely nothing to do with the overall topic of search results. F4LL0U7 The world is complicated, dude. And if something as simple as rethinking your pronouns can make life a little less complicated for people who are having a hard enough time as it is, then why not do it? In your mind, is being a Social Justice Warrior a bad thing? Seems like fighting for social justice is something to be proud of. F4LL0U7 More accurately, it's as if you said "tires are the only things that allow vehicles to move" and then @disqus_DIvkrvAJjQ:disqus cited tank treads, skis, wings, and propellors as other examples. A Person You're right, he/she/ze/it/them/they sounds even crazier when you put it that way. F4LL0U7 Maybe this concept wouldn't be so difficult for you if you spoke another language. Most other languages besides English have gender-neutral pronouns. If English did, then maybe you wouldn't be so offended by having to consider someone's gender identity before referring to them. Nathan Walters There aren't even only 2 sexes, why should the existence of more genders come as any surprise?

Because diversity of thought is like fascist and stuff. C Lo What could possibly go wrong... Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Bahahahahaha! As if I trust Google. I tried this myself with Google vs. Duckduckgo, searching for "Hillary Clinton is a". The results for Google have changed slightly, but they're still flattering. Duckduckgo still suggests criminal, liar, crook, murderer, etc. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/50818a751a00330950eceeca37a2b4d6b8f74ee8691ca9854e4ade9962a6264e.jpg F4LL0U7 Try that with any person in Google and you'll see the same discrepancy. Google already explained this (several months ago, welcome to the party!). They don't associate people's names with negative words in autocomplete. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ That's funny, because I get "Donald Trump is a" cheeto, dinosaur, democrat (now THAT is an insult) on Google. In fact, I get a lot of insulting suggestions for other people. "Bill O'Reilly is a" wife beater? So your explanation does not pass the smell test. F4LL0U7 You won't get suggestions about Trump being a liar (despite video evidence) or a crook (despite him settling out of court for defrauding attendees of his "university"). Google simply does not suggest terms like that. Here's an idea -- Google it. It was in the news almost a year ago. Doby Gillis Seems you need to look up safe space since you're acting like a special, little, snowflake. Bruce Wayne Google is notoriously liberal so it's no surprise that they suppress negative comments about a liberal former presidential candidate and boost negative comments about a Republican president. I just looked up "Hillary Clinton is a..." and I got democrat, war hawk, hologram and hero. I did the same for Trump and got dinosaur, cheeto, gemini etc. And Google expects us to trust them with filtering for "fake news". HA! Scott Will the Google App get search tools?? D.Smithee How about they combat the absolute deluge of fake reviews in the Play Store. Geezus.

Onanuga said this at the opening of a two- Day Training Workshop for staff of the agency on Tuesday in Abuja. The training is being held in collaboration with Google. He said that Google has various tools such as Google search, Google news, Google trend, Google alerts  among others that are important for getting facts that can assist journalists in writing their reports. “Google is just not a website, it gives you an insight of everything that you want to know and ensure that you are on top of your game in terms of what is happening in the country and around the world. “Google has made journalism easy, because you can sit down in the comfort of your house and get facts easily from many sources, the social media platforms, on the internet to fill an entire magazine. “Google also most times streams live events all around the world and this is very remarkable. It is even more remarkable that we are talking of an experience that is just 26 years old, with the founding of the world wide web. Google itself is 19 years old. “I am very happy that it is happening in my lifetime  I want to urge everyone to seize this enormous opportunity that Google has provided. Let every one of us be attentive , ‘’he said. He said that NAN has over 500 reporters in six geo- political zones in the country and there was need for all them to be trained on using Google. Onanuga also noted that not all staff of the agency  are computer  compliant and many of them are still learning. While commending Google for the partnership, called on the organisation to extend the training to other staff in the different zones of the federation. Mr Taiwo Kola-Ogunlade, Communication and Public Affairs Manager, Anglophone West Africa said that Google was imperative for media professionals as it gives on point news of what is happening all around the world. Kola-Ogunlade said that Google would go  a long way in enhancing media excellence and creating  access  to massive information. He urged media practitioners to use Google in order to objective and factual in their reportage. “For instances, we have where images have been used as a breaking news stories in unreflective context and in most cases such media houses have been taken to court. “But with Google, you find  out if the information is the truth or if such images have been reported before, so you can just ask Google for answers, ”he said. Mrs Kate Okewu, a participants said that she was privileged  to be part of the training as her knowledge  on the use of  Google tools has increased. “Before I only use Google to check  my mail and also  to know the meaning of words, but now i am surprised that Google has a lot of tools that will enhance my profession, ”she added. Another participant, Mr Ikenna Osuoha, said the training has offered him the opportunity to know the difference between website and internet and also various ways of accessing information on the internet. He commended the NAN management for facilitating the training.

The Google update, codenamed "Project Owl," gives consumers two new ways to report what they perceive as problems in the search results. The company is also using teams of humans as part of an effort to get its algorithms to show more reliable information. Here's a plain English Q&A about the changes and what they mean to you. Why is Google making changes? The search giant has been under fire for search results that show false, offensive, or outrageous information about certain topics. For instance, Google prominently displayed links to pro-Nazi sites in response to queries about the Holocaust. Or when people started typing phrases about women or racial groups, Google would suggest queries like "Why are women so dumb?" Needless to say this got a lot of negative media attention. Even though Google does not like interfering with its algorithms—which are supposed to find the most helpful answers to a given topic—the problem became big enough Google decided to take action. What are the new ways consumers can report things? The biggest change is to Google's auto-complete function—that's where the search engine suggests options to complete your query. Now, for the first time, there is a way to tell Google if you encounter something wrong or objectionable. As you can see below, the tool now comes with little line that says report inappropriate predictions: Related ThailandThai Police Will Review Ways to Take Down Content After Man Murders Baby in Facebook Video Thailand Thai Police Will Review Ways to Take Down Content After Man Murders Baby in Facebook Video If you click on the line, a box pops up that lets you tell Google the predictions are hateful or violent and so on. That's one of the new ways consumers can report problems—the other is for the information boxes that Google supplies on its main page in response to many queries. Now, there are more ways to tell if those information boxes (which Google calls snippets) contain inaccurate information—for instance, if a box about creationism appeared in response to a question about evolution. Here is a screenshot the tool in action for when someone asks "why is the sky blue." When do these changes go into effect? A Google spokesperson says they are rolling out "gradually" but that most people should see them by tomorrow at latest. What do you mean Google will focus on more reliable information? The third big change coming to Google (the new feedback options are the first two) is the search engine will start giving more weight to what it calls "more authoritative" information. In the past, Google results may have given a high ranking to a site with false information so long as it was popular. That could still happen, of course, but since the new focus is on "authoritative" sites, there's a better chance those will appear ahead of ones that are popular but wrong. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. How will Google decide what is "authoritative?" That's partly where the humans come in. For a few months now, Google has been paying quality raters to review and improve the search results. Their reports (the humans can't change the search results directly) are supposed to help train the algorithms to better weed out the hateful or misleading stuff Google wants to downgrade. So is this going to work? It's too soon to say, though it's worth pointing out that Google already seems to have zapped a lot of the most egregious stuff. For instance, if you type in "Why do [insert racial group] people...," the auto-complete no longer suggests a bunch of offensive things. Meanwhile, the Neo-Nazi sites that until recently dominated many searches for the Holocaust have been pushed off the front page of the Google results for some time now. According to Danny Sullivan, one of the most authoritative voices on Google search issues, the changes will be an improvement but won't fix things altogether. "The reporting forms may help. They can certainly allow individual users to feel that they’ve got an easier way to tell Google when it’s going wrong. The search quality changes, if they work, will be even more important. Still, despite all that Google tries, it knows it won’t solve the problem perfectly." Anything else? Yes, one thing to watch is which websites will be the winners and losers in all this. As Google is so big and its search results are such an important source of traffic, its algorithm changes can bring about a huge change of fortune for certain sites. In the case of one of Google's last major updates, known as Panda, many websites discovered they had been downgraded unexpectedly—causing them to lose readers and audience dollars.

Google's new search tools and changes could help combat fake news Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/25 10:37am PDTApr 25, 2017 15 Plus 1 on G+ 23 Share on Facebook 55 Share on Twitter Total Shares93 Google News Since time immemorial (1998) Google's bread, butter, and raison d'être has been search. Now Google's changing the way search works a bit, empowering users by adding new feedback tools and changing results from their search ranking to bring you more relevant and accurate information. With these changes users should see less in the way of so-called "fake news" and other non-factual content (excluding searches for that material), and more accurate and relevant information pertaining to their search. The biggest user-facing change you are likely to see is probably the new feedback link. It allows users to tag snippets —the short bits of text you might see that directly answer questions posed in a search —or autocomplete results as being accurate, inaccurate, offensive, or just disliked. There's no telling yet exactly how Google may or may not use the data collected via reports, but at a minimum it may go some way to prevent a few of the problems they've seen. I know in the past I've seen snippets come up that are either entirely incorrect or totally unrelated to a search. Hopefully this doesn't just present a new vector for further rank manipulation in autocomplete, though. The changes to search sorting are pretty straightforward. Google's had some problems in the past with sites manipulating how they appear on results. After all, anything that's governed by a set of rules can be gamed using those rules. Even without that Google's had some problems with factually inaccurate results appearing on top of results. They'll be making new changes to ranking to avoid that sort of thing in the future, and they're redoubling their efforts with Google's human oversight in determining quality of results. Their content policy has been updated with the details, and their educational portal on how their Search works has also been changed. Until we see how searches are changed there's no way to know if the new tools might open another means for manipulation of results. While it's possible some might use it as a means of censorship or calumny, hopefully the system is robust enough to resist that type of manipulation. Either way, we shall see.

Branko It's called free speech idiot. Now go and read 1984 before worshipping a private corporation with political interests who has the majority of search traffic. Ozl LOL M. Luciano Damn, MJ was spot on. He said you're coming and here you are! F4LL0U7 Well yesterday's March For Science post is a pretty good indication of how this comment section is about to play out... M. Luciano I must have missed it - wtf is controversial about supporting science? F4LL0U7 A lot, apparently! Check it out. http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/04/24/went-protest-app/#comment-3271548575 Sir_Brizz I think it's wrong to simplify both the "March for Science" and whatever happened in that comments section to "supporting science". Most people would agree with "supporting science" but it is rarely that simple. If you don't understand what problem a reasonably intelligent person would have had with the march or that post, then that probably warrants further investigation on your part to form your own opinions. M. Luciano I was surprised to hear that there was any controversy over the march for science. Science seems like one of the most uncontroversial things one could "march" for. The article didn't mention any controversy, unless people creating an app to collect data at protests is controversial, but then almost every app on every platform would be controversial. Nicholas Conrad It wasn't a march for science, it was just called a march for science. It was a march in support of a particular set of policy prescriptions. Anyone who really supports science would know that science can't be in favor of one policy or another, it can only inform the discussion of costs and benefits of varying policies which then have to be weighed. M. Luciano Furthermore, a Google search for "March for Science Controversy" turns up no controversy. Just a bunch of articles explaining who and what is going on. Is there an actual controversy? People supporting the scientific method and it's application to the challenges of our current world and society... that's not controversial. Nicholas Conrad Clearly a media conspiracy; is mj lamestream? MJ The first of the manipulated BLOCKED! This is NOT a free speech issue so I would suggest a First Amendment 101 class. cooldude5500 Man I loved to search something weird for the predictions so that I could see the most outrageous thing that people were searching for. It was fun, however racist or sexist the predictions would be. Loved to see how weird some people were. FernandoRocker But how can we know if this news is not fake news? 🤔 Ryne Hager OH GOD I'VE BEEN FOUND OUT. See you guys in South America. F4LL0U7 Wow, your posts have been a lot of fun lately!

Sir_Brizz You need to search for it on Google first. Javier180 See I will no longer see CNN in my search results? :D Sir_Brizz Please? Christopher Glass These kinds of people are why the fight is useless. Because anything that doesn't conform with what they want to believe is 'fake'. They don't understand what words mean. Sir_Brizz I presume by "these kinds of people" you mean CNN, right? Christopher Glass I mean YOU. Nicholas Conrad I mean, but clearly you also from that response, so.... madcanada You're precisely the reason why the fight is useless. You will simply believe whatever mainstream media tells you is true. Why bother if you standard of quality is mainstream media? Vivek Rameses So they're censoring what the govt doesn't agree with? Is this new China? FernandoRocker No. Just made in China. M. Luciano What? No. The government isn't mentioned, at all and that's not how it works. They're 1) Not censoring anything and 2) Trying to promote accuracy in search results Vivek Rameses If I were to use Google at least I won't see any CNN, Fox news and the likes. That would be a plus. rebretz000 I think the fact that a tool like this is needed is biggest problem. I can't believe that there are persons out there so gullible that they will believe almost anything posted online. Averix A lot of people don't cross check articles and only read headlines. Sites that base their existence off of ad revenue by getting people into a "click hole" of fake news stories have the psychology of morons figured out. David Warthen We must get rid of the fake news so you can be inundated with all the real news that's completely made up. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ As long as I can filter out /r/the_donald I think that will take care of the majority of it. F4LL0U7 Heads up, a handful of users you've never seen on AP before are about to rain their barely literate rantings upon you. As an example, check out the March For Science post from yesterday. A Person People who attend science marches only push their belief in science when it suits their interests, not when it comes to male is male and female is female. M. Luciano Did that make sense when you wrote it? A Person Yes, it makes sense. M. Luciano What exactly is the scientific understanding of the relationships between sex and gender? We could try sociological, biological and psychological. Let us know when you're ready to read up on the hundreds of peer reviewed studies and provide an analysis. F4LL0U7 People who say things like that have likely never had a child, relative, or friend who turned out to be trans. And even if you haven't, why not try having a little empathy? Life might be more enjoyable, and you might be less angry at things that have absolutely no impact on you whatsoever. A Person That is very selfish of you to enforce others believe or acknowledge something simply because you yourself have experienced. If you have a friend, child, or relative that thinks they should have been the opposite sex, and you didn't attempt to get them psychiatric help, then you dropped the ball. F4LL0U7 I'm sure I should just block you and end this waste of time, but I'll ask anyway: do you think homosexuals need psychiatric help as well, or do you think that's a valid way for a person to live their life? A Person I'm sorry, do all homosexuals think you can switch back and forth between male or female, or whatever other gender you want to make up? If that is the case, then we can talk. I see "other person typing"... but sorry, I'm out... you people are batsh!t crazy. fijisiv Dude keep it up. I have never seen somebody so proud of their ignorance! Is it painful to watch? Is it sad? Is it humorous? Yes. F4LL0U7 Really? Never? (Had to bring it all back around to Devin's OP) https://az616578.vo.msecnd.net/files/responsive/embedded/any/desktop/2016/07/30/636055042891058227364682665_2.jpg Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Kudos to you and @disqus_DIvkrvAJjQ:disqus for attempting to educate @disqus_abcdefg:disqus, but sadly it seems they would rather hide in their little hole and pretend the world is black and white. F4LL0U7 You'd have to take a survey. But I would bet that most of them would be open to modern science, empathy, and leaving people the hell alone. That question was just a litmus test for your level of tolerance to other humans that may or may not fall into your perfect worldview. Sir_Brizz I'll vote for leaving people alone, although that is something that is rarely afforded to others. Nathan Walters You're the one refusing to acknowledge empirical evidence and human experience. Pot, meet kettle. MJ Holy Crap! I could have sworn that I BLOCKED (fixed) you long ago. Dude, stop with your endless ignorant comments. You have never said anything resembling intelligence on any subject here. Are people really this dumb or are most of them actually just trolls? Impossible to tell or know I guess... F4LL0U7 If you're out, does that mean you're not coming back, and I don't have to bother blocking you? Nathan Walters Wait, do you even know what science has to say about issues of biological sex? I'm guessing not. A Person Science says there are two genders, not Facebook's 58... or whatever count they're up to now. F4LL0U7 Sure, if the most recent science book you've read is the bible. A Person LOL... I haven't said anything about the bible. You're a guy or a girl and whatever logic you want to make up in order to twist two genders into 50+... well, let me get my popcorn. M. Luciano This is just as false as it was 4 minutes ago. Most people are a guy or a girl or both, but some are neither. F4LL0U7 I'll refer you to @disqus_DIvkrvAJjQ:disqus's post above, since they've already done the research, and I have to get back to work. M. Luciano You're wrong. "Science" holds 8 known sexes and three known genders. The sexes are X0, XX, XY, ZZ, ZW, WW, Hermaphrodite and asexual. The genders are male, female and neuter. This does not include chromosomal anomalies, such as XXY, XXYY, X and XXX. A Person lol... This is like if I were to argue that "tires can only be round", so your argument becomes "round isn't the only shape". M. Luciano No, it's as if you said, "people are male or female" and then I stated that the scientific understanding is that people are one of eight sexes and one of three genders. Because that's what actually happened. So you were incorrect because you were ignorant of the actual information available to you, now that you have it, you can learn. A Person Dude, I brought up gender and you brought up sex. Why do SJWs like yourself feel it necessary to complicate things as much as possible? M. Luciano You used them interchangeably with Nathan Walters, so figured you wanted to know that they're different. But even if you want to stick to gender only, there are 3, not 2. A Person I didn't use them interchangeably. I brought up gender. He then brought up sex. I didn't bring up sex. This is ridiculous. M. Luciano He brought up sex, you then referred to it as gender ... either way, 3 > 2. And either way, it has absolutely nothing to do with the overall topic of search results. F4LL0U7 The world is complicated, dude. And if something as simple as rethinking your pronouns can make life a little less complicated for people who are having a hard enough time as it is, then why not do it? In your mind, is being a Social Justice Warrior a bad thing? Seems like fighting for social justice is something to be proud of. F4LL0U7 More accurately, it's as if you said "tires are the only things that allow vehicles to move" and then @disqus_DIvkrvAJjQ:disqus cited tank treads, skis, wings, and propellors as other examples. A Person You're right, he/she/ze/it/them/they sounds even crazier when you put it that way. F4LL0U7 Maybe this concept wouldn't be so difficult for you if you spoke another language. Most other languages besides English have gender-neutral pronouns. If English did, then maybe you wouldn't be so offended by having to consider someone's gender identity before referring to them. Nathan Walters There aren't even only 2 sexes, why should the existence of more genders come as any surprise? Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a1ca661e6cd51072403c87d1161ea33d1aa68181de414832321558ead5d02819.jpg Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8f111e2cbfab6a1ab9e37e4dcb1b4e74b67793df6767debf1233b63590f83b15.jpg F4LL0U7 It's funny because 1) you think I'm a Democrat, and 2) you are hours late to this discussion and are making the same exact mistake as @disqus_abcdefg:disqus. kr3000 Excellent, a right wing news blocker. Because diversity of thought is like fascist and stuff. C Lo What could possibly go wrong... Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Bahahahahaha! As if I trust Google. I tried this myself with Google vs. Duckduckgo, searching for "Hillary Clinton is a". The results for Google have changed slightly, but they're still flattering. Duckduckgo still suggests criminal, liar, crook, murderer, etc. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/50818a751a00330950eceeca37a2b4d6b8f74ee8691ca9854e4ade9962a6264e.jpg F4LL0U7 Try that with any person in Google and you'll see the same discrepancy. Google already explained this (several months ago, welcome to the party!). They don't associate people's names with negative words in autocomplete. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ That's funny, because I get "Donald Trump is a" cheeto, dinosaur, democrat (now THAT is an insult) on Google. In fact, I get a lot of insulting suggestions for other people. "Bill O'Reilly is a" wife beater? So your explanation does not pass the smell test. F4LL0U7 You won't get suggestions about Trump being a liar (despite video evidence) or a crook (despite him settling out of court for defrauding attendees of his "university"). Google simply does not suggest terms like that. Here's an idea -- Google it. It was in the news almost a year ago. Doby Gillis Seems you need to look up safe space since you're acting like a special, little, snowflake. Bruce Wayne Google is notoriously liberal so it's no surprise that they suppress negative comments about a liberal former presidential candidate and boost negative comments about a Republican president. I just looked up "Hillary Clinton is a..." and I got democrat, war hawk, hologram and hero. I did the same for Trump and got dinosaur, cheeto, gemini etc. And Google expects us to trust them with filtering for "fake news". HA! Scott Will the Google App get search tools?? D.Smithee How about they combat the absolute deluge of fake reviews in the Play Store. Geezus.

Google frequently tweaks the algorithms that return relevant search results, sometimes privately, and other times publicly. In this case, Google announced Tuesday that about 0.25 percent of all daily search results have been returning “offensive or clearly misleading content,” and those results will be pushed lower in search results in favor of more authoritative results.  Google is also implementing Feedback links for users to report on the accuracy of autocomplete search queries and Featured Snippet text. Deliberately misleading information, as well as outright fabrications, plagued the 2016 U.S. presidential primary season and election. Numerous sources found that sites purporting to be legitimate news services were simply making up “news” stories for profit, or as propaganda, and sharing them on social media sites like Facebook. Politicians on both sides used “fake news” as a rallying cry, and studies, such as this one from Stanford University, found that students were increasingly unable to tell the difference between a legitimate news story and a fabricated one. The problem, according to Google, is that 15 percent of all daily searches are brand new. Google can easily know the answer to a query like “Is the earth flat?”  But if it’s a query the search engine hasn’t seen before, it has fewer sources of context to rely on. Google What Google’s feedback will look like for autosuggested searches. Why this matters: Google’s efforts should be applauded, but it’s unclear what difference this will make in the long run. The problem isn’t so much that users are searching for fake news; it’s that they’re being force-fed a steady diet of propaganda from friends, contacts, and fake-news sites they’ve already bought into. Facebook tried to solve the problem last fall by implementing a verification mechanisms to combat fake news, but it’s not clear that it’s working.  Letting users help decide what’s fake, offensive Last fall, Google announced plans to attach a “Fact Check” label to search results, which it began rolling out in April.  Fact Check attempts to adjudicate whether the information in question is truly accurate, using sources like Snopes.com. Still, Fact Check was a response to users who were already searching for a given news report or “fact." Google’s latest tweak makes erroneous results harder to find. “We’ve adjusted our signals to help surface more authoritative pages and demote low-quality content, so that issues similar to the Holocaust denial results that we saw back in December are less likely to appear,” Ben Gomes, Google’s vice president of engineering for search, wrote. Google Feedback for Featured Snippets lets users identify possible fake news. That effort will be assisted by what Google calls Search Quality Raters, real people who assess the quality of Google’s search results. While those people don’t affect search results in real time, they do provide feedback on whether the changes to the algorithms are working, Gomes wrote. More direct input from users themselves will come via new Feedback links attached to autocompleted searches and Featured Snippets. These links are tiny, a gray bit of text at the bottom of the autocomplete bar or the snippet itself. Clicking them, however, allows users to provide direct feedback. In the example Google provided, users can mark checkboxes to state whether a suggested search was hateful or sexually explicit. (Google doesn’t allow autocompleted queries to be marked as inaccurate, since they’re presumably questions.) Google’s Featured Snippets evolved as quick synopses of the answers users were searching for, such as when the Leaning Tower of Pisa was built. Now users can assess the snippet with anything from “I don’t like this” to “This is harmful, dangerous, or violent” to “This is misleading or inaccurate.” It’s not clear what happens when an autocompleted search or snippet is marked as inaccurate or inoffensive, however. (We’ve reached out to Google, but representatives didn’t immediately respond.) Will Google’s algorithms take over, or will an actual human make the call?  Reporting real information as fake could have negative effects, too.  As we’ve learned over the past months, “fake news” is often in the eye of the beholder.

Google’s Waymo self-driving cars are taking riders for free trips around the Phoenix area, just like Uber. But while Uber was forced to relocate its autonomous vehicle testing program to the Grand Canyon State after California unceremoniously kicked it out for refusing to obtain the proper permits, Waymo appears to have quietly set up shop in Phoenix, and has been testing the minivans with a small group of people for at least a month. Waymo is now opening up the program to applicants, and ordered hundreds of minivans to keep up with what it expects will be heavy demand. Just days after Uber settled into Arizona from California in February, Google sued the ride-sharing company. Google accused Uber of stealing its Light Detection and Ranging system (LiDAR), which allows self-driving cars to successfully navigate roads and obstacles. Google’s LiDAR was in development for several years; the lawsuit says Uber was stuck with a third-party device until it bought Otto, a self-driving truck company started by a former Waymo engineer Anthony Levandowski in February 2016. According to the lawsuit, Uber then integrated Otto’s LiDAR into its cars. Levandowski is accused of stealing Waymo’s technology to use for his own business, with plans to then sell it to Uber. Uber is accused of knowing of and supporting those plans because it had meetings with Levandowski just before he resigned from Google in January 2016. So, is Waymo setting up its first public test run of its cars in the same city as Uber commenced its test run meant to be a slight against Uber? While the reasoning remains unclear, some signs point to no. Arizona is one of the few, if not only, states that doesn’t require self-driving cars to get special permits, which require time, money, and, probably most importantly, publicly disclosing information about programs that companies would prefer to keep top secret. That was one of the state’s selling points to Uber when it aggressively courted it after it ran into trouble with California’s DMV. “This latest phase of Waymo’s testing will provide new transportation options for Arizonans who participate, and help pave the way for the expansion of this technology,” Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey said in a somewhat muted statement. Ducey was thrilled to bits when Uber arrived in his state, issuing a press release begging the company to come to his state and becoming one of the first riders when it did. As a whole, Uber’s self-driving cars seem to have done well in Arizona. The one incident of note involved one of them flipping over after an accident that police said was caused by another car driven by an old-fashioned, error-prone human being. The results in Arizona have been much better than in San Francisco, where the self-driving cars were caught running red lights. Uber blamed that on human drivers who had taken over the self-driving system at the time of the offense, but The New York Times reported that the cars were, in fact, in self-driving mode when they blew through six red lights in December 2016. While Uber’s self-driving cars pick up Uber customers just like its old, human-driven cars, Waymo’s vans are free to use for people accepted into the early-rider program, who are supposed to use it for their day-to-day driving needs, rather than for the occasional ride. Waymo says it has accumulated millions of miles on public roads over its years of testing, but this is the first time its cars have been open to the public.

Following pushback over fake news being surfaced in search results, Google on Tuesday introduced changes to the way it ranks websites in Search along with easier ways for people to provide feedback. "It's become very apparent that a small set of queries in our daily traffic (around 0.25 percent), have been returning offensive or clearly misleading content, which is not what people are looking for," Google's Vice President of Engineering Ben Gomes wrote in a blog post. Google is improving the methods it uses to evaluate sites, and is rolling out algorithmic updates to "surface more authoritative content" and demote fake news, Gomes wrote. This way, "issues similar to the Holocaust denial results that we saw back in December are less likely to appear." As part of the effort, the Google last month updated its Search Quality Rater Guidelines, which real-life evaluators use to assess the quality of its search results. These people offer feedback on Google's search results to help the company identify areas it needs to improve. The updated guidelines "provide more detailed examples of low-quality webpages for raters to appropriately flag, which can include misleading information, unexpected offensive results, hoaxes and unsupported conspiracy theories," Gomes wrote. "These guidelines will begin to help our algorithms in demoting such low-quality content." Google is also making it easier for people to flag offensive or inaccurate content that appears in Autocomplete and Featured Snippets — the block of information at the top of search results for certain queries, which was the subject of some controversy in March. "The content that appears in these features is generated algorithmically and is a reflection of what people are searching for and what's available on the web," Gomes explained. "This can sometimes lead to results that are unexpected, inaccurate or offensive." Now, if you see an offensive Autocomplete prediction as you're typing a query into the Google Search bar, just click the link that says "Report inappropriate predictions" to let Google know about it. Or, if you see a Featured Snippet that looks off, click the "Feedback" link under the box to report it. Related 21 Google Search Tips You Need to Learn 21 Google Search Tips You Need to Learn As part of this effort, Google is also getting more transparent about its products. To that end, the company has updated its Autocomplete policies along with its How Search Works site to offer users more information. "While our search results will never be perfect, we're as committed as always to preserving your trust and to ensuring our products continue to be useful for everyone," Gomes wrote. The changes come after Google earlier this month introduced a new "fact check" label to fight fake news. Facebook and Mozilla also recently teamed up with Craigslist founder Craig Newmark, academic institutions, nonprofits, and other organizations to launch a $14 million consortium dubbed the News Integrity Initiative, aimed at "helping people make informed judgments about the news they read and share online." Plus, Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales on Monday launched an ad-free news service called Wikitribune, which aims to quell the fake news tide.

Today, Google released a number of Translate and language-focused updates for Chrome, Search, and more. Nintendo Switch First announced last year, neural machine translation now works between English and nine widely used Indian languages: Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Tamil, Telugu, Gujarati, Punjabi, Malayalam and Kannada. This new system will result in more accurate results — especially for full sentences — as Google now translates entire sentences at a time, instead of pieces with the older phrase-based system. Translations will also be more natural and feature proper grammar. These changes are available today on Google Search and Translate’s Android, iOS, and web apps. Chrome’s built-in Translate feature will now leverage neural machine translation. The Chrome and Translate teams have worked together to bring the same improvements to full-page translations between English and the nine Indian languages above. Google notes that the feature is used on over 150 million pages every single day. Another related update is to Gboard, with support for 11 new languages in addition to current 11 existing ones. Featuring transliteration support, Google has officially unveiled the new text editing tool spotted in the Gboard beta, as well as more resizing options. Lastly, Google Search now has a built-in Rajpal & Sons Hindi dictionary added in partnership with the Oxford University Press.

PCs give kids access to the information that they need to finish homework, learn new things and explore the world around them. Of course, it also allows things in that you wouldn’t normally be comfortable with coming through the front door. It’s not just you, parents everywhere are keen to learn more about online safety. That’s why learning how to block porn sites is of concern. You’d block porn sites on Windows 10 for the same reasons that you’d block any site really. There are things that your child might not be ready to see or learn about just yet. You want them to be emotionally ready before they do. In that way, these sites aren’t any different from blocking Facebook or Twitter. It’s good to control the information flowing to them as much as you possibly can in an always connected, always sharing world. Here’s how to block porn sites in Windows 10. Read: How to Set Parental Controls in Windows 8 Here’s how to block porn sites on Windows 10. How to Block Porn Sites Using Bing Safe Search Search makes it easy to find anything online. Forget browsing to a bunch of different sites, Bing and Google allow you to find what you want as quickly as possible. That’s one of the reasons your quest to block porn sites on Windows 10 should start with them. Read: Microsoft Edge Tips & Tricks: Better Browsing in Windows 10 Microsoft’s Bing Search engine has a feature called SafeSearch that ensures you can prevent your kids from finding these they shouldn’t using it. Sign in on the Windows 10 notebook or tablet that you wish to block porn sites on. If it’s a device the entire family uses, just open a web browser. If your child is a bit older and has their own account on the notebook, desktop or tablet, sign into their account on their device. Open a web browser and navigate to Bing.com. Tap or click on the menu button in the top-right corner of the Bing website. Now look for SafeSearch in the list of options. If it shows Strict, you’ve already configured it to its highest settings. If it shows Moderate or Off, tap or click on it. Change the SafeSearch setting option at the top of your screen to Strict. Tap or click on Save at the bottom of your screen. Now you should be taken back to the Bing homepage. Note that this should also block inappropriate content when using the search bar built into the Taskbar along the bottom edge of your display. How to Block Porn Sites Using Google Safe Search The same SafeSearch switch is available in Google Search, which is arguably more important. It’s the world’s largest search engine. Chances are your child might try using it to search for content that you don’t want them to see. With this, you want to be logged into their Google Account if they’re old enough to have one. If it’s a family computer and they don’t have a Google Account, don’t worry. You can turn on SafeSearch for everyone that’s not logged in. Open a web browser and navigate to Google.com/preferences. Select the SafeSearch checkbox. If you’re logged into their account, tap or click on Lock SafeSearch. You’ll be required to login with a Google Account for this. Once logged in, click the Lock SafeSearch button. The problem with using SafeSearch on either Bing or Google is that it’s not foolproof. That is, Microsoft and Google are careful to note that it won’t absolutely stop your child from finding things they shouldn’t. What’s more, they only prevent search results. They don’t stop your child from going directly to an inappropriate website. How to Block Porn Sites Using Microsoft Family To truly block porn sites on Windows 10 you’ll need to use a feature called Microsoft Family. Microsoft Family is Windows 10’s dedicated parental control tool. It’s built into the operating system and Microsoft Account’s website. To use Microsoft Family effectively, your child will need a Microsoft Account of their own. You can create them one for free. Click or tap on the Windows button in the Taskbar. Find the Settings app in your list of installed apps listed under S. Inside the Settings app, tap or click on Accounts. Select Family and Other People from the menu on the left side of the Settings app. We’ve already created a child account for this tutorial. It’s listed here. You can use the + to add a child. Select what type of account you’d like to add and provide the email address for their existing Microsoft Account. Be sure to select Add a child. If they don’t have one already, click the link that says, “The person I want to add doesn’t have an email address.” It’ll guide you through creating one for them. When you’re done providing the account information, tap or click on Manage Family Settings online. Find their account inside the list of child accounts and select Web Browsing. Flip the on switch for Block Inappropriate Websites. Now you should see all kinds of new options for you to take advantage of. The checkbox that says Only See Websites Allowed on the List lets you list all the websites you want your child to have access to. They won’t be able to load any site that you don’t add to the list on this page. By default, this switch is unchecked so that your child doesn’t have to always come to you to get access to a new site. Along the bottom of the page, you’ll find a second list of sites. You can add sites to this list for Windows to always block when your child tries to access them. This option is only available when you have the Only See Websites Allowed on the List option turned off. Other companies have solutions for trying to block porn sites and questionable material on a PC. You may have one installed already. Microsoft Family doesn’t cost you a thing. What’s more, it takes care of some of the issues that crop up with blocking sites. Blocking things this way only works in Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge. As such, Microsoft Family will prevent your child from trying to install other web browsers to get around the block. It’ll send you automatic reports on what your child is doing online. You can gift them money to buy things in the Windows Store too. Screen time is a big concern of modern parents. Microsoft Family allows you to decide how much time they spend on any notebook, desktop, tablet or Xbox One from one website.

[Painting: “Napoleon Crossing the Alps” by Jacques-Louis David] By DJ Pangburn04.25.17 | 2:00 pm In early January, the artist and technologist Daniel Howe opened an email from Google informing him that his three-year-old ad-blocking app, AdNauseam, had just been banned from the company’s Chrome Web store. Overnight, he discovered, the free app’s 60,000 users had lost access to the app on Google’s popular browser, and all comments, ratings, reviews, and statistics had vanished. advertisement Ads are the economic powerhouse of the internet, supporting much of its “free” content and services, this website included. But they are also easy to hate, making the internet distracting, ugly, slow, and more costly to use. This partly helps explain the demand for ad blockers: Installations grew by 30% last year to 615 million computer or mobile devices, or 11% of the world’s online population, according to estimates by Page Fair, an industry group. Google and its parent company, Alphabet, which dominates the market for online ads and made an estimated $79 billion from them in 2016, has taken a largely hands-off approach to the potentially existential threat of ad blockers. And, according to recent reports, it now plans to include “ad-filtering” software pre-installed in Chrome—an “if you can’t beat ’em, join ’em” approach to making the web less annoying. But AdNauseum isn’t like the other ad blockers: It takes a more activist approach. Rather than just concealing them, the app sends noise into the system by automatically clicking on ads in the background, muddling efforts by advertisers and ad networks like Google’s to determine your preferences and your identity as you browse the web. Alan Toner, a policy consultant at the Electronic Frontier Foundation who studies ad blocking, calls AdNauseum affectionately, “a piece of agitprop theater” designed to “creatively protest the surveillance mechanism behind advertising.” “No Clarity At All” Google, however, didn’t complain about AdNauseum’s approach to protesting ads. Instead, it pointed to a developer agreement that gives the company “the right to suspend or bar any Product from the Web Store at its sole discretion,” and offered a more prosaic reason for the ban: An extension should have a single purpose that is clear to users. Do not create an extension that requires users to accept bundles of unrelated functionality, such as an email notifier and a news headline aggregator. Baffled, Howe wrote back to ask Google how this rule applied to AdNauseum. In a second email, a company representative explained that an extension should not perform both blocking and hiding ads. In an email, a Google spokesperson confirmed to me that the company’s single-purpose policy was the reason for the app’s removal, not because it automatically clicked on ads, but wouldn’t comment further. To Howe and his cofounders, designer and activist Mushon Zer-Aviv and NYU information science professor Helen Nissenbaum, this explanation is hard to accept at face value. Many ad blockers, including uBlock, Adblock Plus, Adblock, and Adguard, both hide and block ads, trackers, and malware, and yet all of these are allowed in the Chrome Web store; AdNauseum had been in the store for two years. Instead, the team suspected a simpler motive behind Google’s decision: AdNauseum directly conflicts with the way that the company makes most of its money. advertisement Murshon Zer-Aviv [Photo: Erhardt Graeff/MIT]“Why would [Google] allow almost any other ad blocker to also block malware and only block us for doing so?” said Zer-Aviv. Alok Bhardwaj, the founder of the Epic browser, which has had its own privacy-related clash with Google, said Google’s explanation reflected “strained logic.” But he also said that AdNauseum’s click-all-the-ads approach raised the threat of ad blockers by an order of magnitude. “If there’s considerable doubt over whether an ad click is legitimate or not, that’s a big problem for Google charging for ad clicks,” he wrote in an email. “It could undermine Google’s business model more severely than plain ad blockers, so it’s probably their thought to ‘nip it in the bud.'” “The official reasons offered for their exclusion have been so generic as to provide no clarity at all,” Toner said. “Its exclusion needs an explanation.” Ads Aren’t Just Ugly: They’re Invasive Google’s decision to ban AdNauseum was only the latest salvo in an ongoing war over online advertising. The industry and publishers have recently been fighting back against ad blockers, for instance, by requiring visitors to disable them if they want to view a page. In August, Facebook announced it was blocking anti-ad software across its platform. And while AdNauseum is the first desktop ad blocker Google has blocked, it has previously banned mobile apps like anti-tracking tool Disconnect and ad blocker AdBlock Fast from its Android Play Store, citing a rule that says one app can’t interfere with another. The ad industry also knows that ads can be a nuisance, and it’s taking pre-emptive measures to make them more palatable—or, in Google’s case, to block the unpalatable ones. “We feel like there are a lot of challenges in advertising. There are a lot of wrong ways,” Darin Fisher, vice president of Chrome engineering, told CNet last year. But “if publishers and advertisers do ads the right way, it can be great for the users and for the ecosystem.” But Google’s positions also point to a crucial disagreement at the heart of the ad war: What makes ads such a nuisance to begin with? advertisement Advocates insist that ads aren’t just ugly, annoying, and bandwidth-sucking: They pose a risk to privacy, as the networks of software behind ads—cookies, trackers, and malware—watch not only where you go on the web but, through your phone and your purchases, what you do in real life. This data, which helps data brokers better understand you, includes everything from your health to your shopping and financial habits to your political and religious views. But privacy is largely missing from Google’s discussion of problematic ads, says Howe. By avoiding mentioning AdNauseum’s actual intent, Google’s explanation for banning it echoes the advertising industry’s discussion of web ads, which focuses on aesthetics rather than privacy. “Google does not want the ad-blocking debate to be about surveillance and civil liberties because it has very weak arguments to make there,” he wrote in a post on the blog of Princeton’s Center for Information Technology Policy. Instead, “it would like to keep the debate to the economics and aesthetics of ads…” Mobile ad blocker use—much of it in Asia—now outpaces use on desktop browsers. [Chart: PageFair]With a built-in ad filter for Chrome, which commands an estimated 60% of the browser market, Google could continue to frame the debate in terms of aesthetics rather than in terms of privacy. Google’s ad filter would be based on standards drawn up last month by The Coalition For Better Ads, a global coalition of advertisers cofounded by Google and including industry groups, publishers like Facebook and The Washington Post, and advertisers like Proctor & Gamble and Unilever. (Apple, which permits third-party blockers on its Safari browser, and Mozilla, which includes anti-ad features in its Firefox browser, are not part of the Coalition.) The new guidelines urge the rest of the industry to stop using the kind of annoying ad formats that have fueled the rapid rise of ad blockers, like pop-ups, auto-play video ads, and full-screen ads. But the standards do not mention tracking or user privacy. “By banning AdNauseam and then rolling out its own ad blocker, Google is now trying to prevent anyone else from drawing the line in the sand when it comes to which ads are presented to the user,” Zer-Aviv said. Google would be “leveraging its near monopoly in the ad and browser markets to forcefully exclude any competition that does not align with its model of ‘acceptable ads,’ be it other ad networks, the Do Not Track standard, or privacy initiatives like our own.” Google’s advertising business depends upon tracking more than ever. A little-noticed change to the company’s privacy policy last year gave it the ability to track users’ web activity across a majority of sites and apps. (In a concession to privacy, the company also now allows users to change their default settings to “opt-out of ad personalization.”) advertisement Google’s ad blocker could give the company more leverage over advertisers and other ad blockers that have recently launched so-called “Acceptable Ads” programs, which permit some ads to be shown that are deemed to be “non-intrusive.” Google and other major ad networks already pay to participate in AdBlock Plus’s acceptable ads program, which provides the bulk of revenues for Eyeo GmbH, the company that makes the app. A Google ad filter could also effectively suppress a new Do Not Track standard. The older standard is essentially an automated request from your browser, asking the websites you visit to refrain from tracking you. The new version of DNT, developed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, is dynamic: It asks websites not to track you and it knows if they comply. In its most recent update, AdNauseum permitted sites that complied with the Do Not Track policy to display ads to users, and refrained from clicking on those ads. (Because Google does not comply with DNT, the app blocked Google resources such as Doubleclick.net and Google Analytics.) Howe thinks the new DNT feature may have contributed to Google’s decision to boot AdNauseum from the web store. The standard may be threatening to Google, Howe wrote in his blog post, “perhaps because it could represent a real means for users, advertisers, and content providers to move away from surveillance-based advertising.” If enough sites adopt Do Not Track, “there will be significant financial incentive for advertisers to place ads on those sites, and these too will be bound by DNT, as the mechanism also applies to a site’s third-party partners. And this could possibly set off a chain reaction of adoption that would leave Google, which has committed to surveillance as its core business model, out in the cold.” Toner, of the EFF, said “it does seem like a strange coincidence” that AdNauseum was banned soon after it integrated support for the new DNT standard. Privacy Badger, the EFF’s own Chrome app that blocks cross-site trackers, also supports the new DNT standard, but it has not encountered problems with Google, he said. Cable companies are also seeking a piece of the marketing pie on which Google, Facebook, and other digital media giants are already feasting. The bill President Trump signed last month to repeal privacy rules for internet service providers will allow those companies to collect and sell customers’ browsing data to third parties without their express consent. advertisement The playing field is growing ever more sophisticated too, as companies combine web data mining with personality behaviors gleaned via Facebook to better profile consumers and target them with ever more persuasive ads, be it for pop stars or politicians. “We think that ISPs should not be helping track their users,” said Cooper Quintin, a security researcher and programmer at EFF. Nor do most Americans, according to a survey by YouGov and the Huffington Post. Seventy-one percent of the public—and 72% of Republicans—believe the FCC’s privacy rules should have gone into effect (see the interactive chart below). Some states, meanwhile, including Minnesota and Washington, are contemplating new privacy rules to pick up the slack. Users who want privacy from ad tracking can use a variety of free and subscription-based software to defend themselves. Toner suggests installing tracker blockers like Privacy Badger, Disconnect and uBlock, beefing up ad-blocker software with the Easyprivacy filter, and turning off Acceptable Ads in AdBlock Plus or AdBlock for Chrome. Browsers like Firefox, Epic, or Brave also include ad blocking and anti-tracking features. Meanwhile, new technologies for ad blocking, including a prototype “perceptual” ad blocker developed by researchers at Princeton and Stanford, promise even more effective ad blocking in the future. And despite Google’s ban, AdNauseum still works in Firefox and Opera, while enterprising Chrome users can manually install the app in developer mode. New Privacy Laws Legal changes are also on the horizon. A new set of rules in the European Union called the General Data Protection Regulation, scheduled to go into effect in May, will require all companies serving the region’s more than 500 million residents to receive explicit consent from those users for ad targeting or risk paying prohibitive fines—as much as 4% of their global revenues. The impact of the EU rules on ad targeting could be global, and could dovetail with efforts by some advertisers to improve the way they distribute ads. Currently, the complex ecosystem of online ads is rife with click fraud and distribution schemes that make it hard for advertisers to know if ads are actually being viewed and what kind of content their ads are appearing next to. Building more transparency and simplicity into the system could benefit not only readers but advertisers and publishers too. advertisement Even after the new EU laws, privacy proponents are likely to continue trying to build better blockers, and companies like Google will keep trying to make that work difficult—or build their own. Google will likely maintain the upper hand. To Zer-Aviv, the company’s banning of AdNauseum was less about compliance with rules (the policy that Chrome apps should not have “multiple functionality”) than about a show of force. He interpreted Google’s “multiple functionality” argument as trying to “force us to compromise our software’s security”—by requiring the app to remove its malware-blocking features—”so we can be easily discredited.” But in recent weeks, the team decided to change course: It amended AdNauseum so that it would not block malware, in order to meet what they thought was compliance with Google’s policy. Again, the app was rejected. In another email, Google cited the app’s “multiple functionality” as a problem, Zer-Aviv said. “I think this pretty much seals the question about Google’s sincerity on the reasons for the ban against AdNauseam.” As he and his cofounders argue, real progress in online privacy isn’t about the option to see less annoying ads: It would require corporate policy and government regulations to align to give users an option to fully opt out of online tracking if they want to. Until that happens, anything less isn’t much of an option at all. With additional reporting by Alex Pasternack.

The researchers say they have found a key part of the brain involved in identifying sounds that is used to predict upcoming words during conversation. And companies like Google and Facebook could one day use the technology to create devices that read users' minds, one researcher suggests. Scroll down for video  Scientists have discovered how the brain helps us to predict what is coming next in speech. The researchers say they have found a key part of the brain involved in identifying sounds that is used to predict upcoming words during conversation  HOW THE BRAIN PREDICTS SPEECH  The researchers found that certain types of neurons are constantly and actively making predictions. These neurons are found in the brain's auditory cortex - a key region involved in understanding sound.  Predictions occur shortly before the neurons notice when a prediction mistake has occurred. 'The reason this is important relates to how it could ultimately help people with problems predicting what will happen next,' study lead author Professor Chris Petkov told MailOnline. 'For example, scientists can next ask whether one or both types of neuronal predictive responses rely on each other and which might be malfunctioning in people that suffer from different types of disorders.' 'Google and Facebook are really interested in how your brain makes predictions and learns because they want to use brain signals to control phones or to improve predictions in their software,' study lead author Professor Chris Petkov, a neuropsychologist at Newcastle University, told MailOnline.  'They want to know how they can predict what people do, and how they can then change devices to reflect this. 'Our work shows how this happens in the brain: Neurons make predictions at specific points in time and adjust those predictions when a prediction mistake happens.' The researchers say that the area they have identified is found within the brain's 'auditory cortex', a region unchanged by evolution for millions of years. It is inhibited in people with disorders such as dyslexia, schizophrenia and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The finding could one day lead to a better understanding and treatment of these conditions, the researchers claim. 'There are groups around the world who could use these findings to see how the brain makes predictions and also how it responds when it is wrong,' Professor Petkov told MailOnline. 'Ultimately we do want to help people who struggle to make predictions, such as those with dyslexia or ADHD, to better make those predictions.

Using an approach developed for studying language learning in children, Professor Petkov and his team had humans and monkeys decode a made-up language. The groups were played a sequence of sounds or short sentences of words spoken in the language, which has properties and rules that subjects could follow. The team made their finding by having humans and monkeys decode a made-up language. This image shows the artificial grammar rules of the fake language and the phase-amplitude coupling seen by the team in the human 'auditory cortex' - a key region used to decode sound Both species were able to learn the predictive relationships between the spoken sounds in the sequences. Activity in the auditory cortex of the two species revealed how groups of neurons responded to the speech sounds and to the learned predictive relationships between those sounds. 'Even direct recordings from the brain do not give us access to what the neurons are doing, which is why the link to monkeys was so important to establish,' Professor Petkov told MailOnline. 'We see that certain types of neurons are constantly and actively making predictions.  'This occurs shortly before the neurons notice when a prediction mistake has occurred. 'The reason this is important relates to how it could ultimately help people with problems predicting what will happen next. 'For example, scientists can next ask whether one or both types of neuronal predictive responses rely on each other and which might be malfunctioning in people that suffer from different types of disorders.' The brain responses in monkeys and humans were found to be remarkably similar in both species. This suggests that the way the human auditory cortex responds to speech has been passed down through a common ancestor, rather than being uniquely specialised in humans for speech or language. 'A number of things were very similar between the monkeys and humans, suggesting a fundamental element to prediction in the brain,' Professor Petkov told MailOnline. 'Being able to predict events is vital for so much of what we do every day.' Study coauthor Dr Yuki Kikuchi added: 'In effect we have discovered the mechanisms for speech in your brain that work like predictive text on your mobile phone, anticipating what you are going to hear next. 'This could help us better understand what is happening when the brain fails to make fundamental predictions, such as in people with dementia or after a stroke.' Building on these results, the team are working to understand how predictive brain signals go wrong in patients with stroke or dementia. The long-term goal is to identify strategies that yield more accurate prognoses and treatments for these patients.

Press Release YI Technology and Google Unveil YI HALO at NAB 2017 The Most Advanced Stereoscopic, 360-Degree, Virtual Reality Jump Camera For Professional Creators And Filmmakers, Now Available For Pre-Orders LAS VEGAS -- (BUSINESS WIRE) -- YI Technology, the leading, international provider of advanced, intelligent imaging technologies, today unveiled YI HALO, a next generation virtual reality (VR) camera built with Google's Jump technology. YI HALO meets even professional VR creators’ and filmmakers’ most challenging demands. By combining the most advanced capture technology and stitching with ease and versatility, creators can see everything, go anywhere, and create vibrant, immersive VR stories and experiences with confidence. “Virtual reality provides incredible new opportunities for creators,” said Sean Da, CEO of YI Technology, “but it also poses a whole new level of challenges. To truly meet the promise of VR, the image quality, capture and stitching needs to match the immersive experience. To be truly active, you have to be able to shoot when and however you want, from many points of view, and without worrying about losing power; and you have to know it will just work, in your control, now and in the future.

Google announced new plans to target 'fake news' on Tuesday, saying its new screening system is designed to help reduce the number of false stories that come up in searches.  (JOSH EDELSON / AFP/GETTY IMAGES)   By The Washington Post Tues., April 25, 2017 Thanks to the phenomenon of “fake news,” Google is going to start asking you for help with its search results rather than relying solely on its algorithms. The search giant said Tuesday that it will make it much easier for anyone to give it feedback on its search results, which is the way that most people use Google. For everyday users, that means that if you see a result featured on Google’s pages that you think is wrong or offensive, then you can actually do something about it. Read more: Facebook, Google to tackle ‘fake news’ in Canada with new tools Google framed the problem as a quality issue. “Today, in a world where tens of thousands of pages are coming online every minute of every day, there are new ways that people try to game the system,” said vice president of engineering Ben Gomes in an official blog post. According to Google, approximately .25 per cent of its results “have been returning offensive or clearly misleading content.” The company didn’t specify how many queries that really is — but the search-engine-focused news site Search Engine Land reported that Google estimated in 2015 that it handles 3 billion searches per day. Some back-of-the-envelope math suggests that users could be seeing as many as 7.5 million misleading results every day. Article Continued Below Users will see options to report bad information that shows up in “Featured Snippets” — a.k.a., the little summary boxes that appear at the top or sides of Google searches. They will also be able to report offensive autocomplete suggestions — the suggested phrases that show up when you begin typing a query in the search engine. Users can report suggestions for being hateful, explicit or violent. For the snippets, users can also report when the summaries are inaccurate. Google has also tweaked its search algorithms to ensure that “low-quality” content shows up lower in search results, which should minimize their reach. This should address issues such as one Google dealt with last year, when a prominent Holocaust denial site showed up at the top of search results for “did the holocaust happen.” Since the U.S. election, several companies including Google and Facebook have taken steps to deal with false information that looks legitimate being passed through their products. In the past, both companies have been hesitant to step in and provide quality controls for information that appears on their products, preferring instead to let their algorithms weed out bad results. And like Facebook, Google has recently undertaken broader efforts to fight misleading information and hate speech online. The company has started pairing some claims online with fact-check articles, which say whether a claim is true or false. It has also released a tool for developers to let them automatically moderate online messages better. Google users will start seeing the reporting options Tuesday. This particular effort has been underway since mid-December, said Google spokeswoman Susan Cadrecha in an email.

The global health community and a coalition of public-private initiatives has successfully begun taming the scourge, with a 21% decrease in its global incidence and 29% drop in mortality rate between 2010 and 2015; still, there were 212 million malaria cases worldwide and nearly 430,000 deaths from the disease in 2015, according to the latest World Health Organization (WHO) figures. One key tactic for fighting infectious diseases like malaria is to pinpoint exactly where they're spreading in order to stop them in their tracks. This way, preventive measures like mosquito control and the deployment of treatment resources can be better targeted. Google, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) have banded together with academic and public health partners with this very goal in mind—and are harnessing machine learning through the Google Earth Engine to accomplish it. The organizations are taking part in a Malaria Elimination Initiative effort called project DiSARM which will be piloted in Swaziland and Zimbabwe and uses the Google Earth Engine to map malaria. The University of California, San Francisco's (UCSF) epidemiology and biostatistics professor Hugh Sturrock—who leads DiSARM—explained exactly why Google's tech can help fight the disease. "Every time someone is diagnosed with malaria in Swaziland and Zimbabwe, a team goes to the village where the infection occurred and collects a GPS point with the precise infection location," he said in an interview posted on Google's blog. "Just looking at these points won’t allow you to accurately determine the risk of malaria, though. You also need satellite imagery of conditions like rainfall, temperature, slope and elevation, which affect mosquito breeding and parasite development." In addition to producing high-resolution "risk maps," the Google Earth Engine makes this seemingly ancillary (yet critical) data far easier to collect, according to Sturrock. " In the past we had to obtain those images from a range of sources: NASA, USGS and different universities around the world. But with Google Earth Engine, it’s all in one place and can be processed using Google computers. We combine satellite imagery data from Google Earth Engine with the locations of malaria cases collected by a country’s national malaria control program, and create models that let us generate maps identifying areas at greatest risk." Concurrent advances in malaria drug development could also get a boost from this type of tech; on Monday, the WHO announced the next phase of a real world trial testing an experimental malaria vaccine in Africa. Correction: April 25, 5:35 p.m.: The original version of this article misstated the mortality rate from malaria. It has been corrected.

Google said today it is taking its first attempt to combat the circulation of "fake news" on its search engine. The company is offering new tools that will allow users to report misleading or offensive content, and it also pledged to improve results generated by its algorithm. From a report: While the algorithm tweaks should impact on general search results, the reporting tools have been designed for Google's Autocomplete predictions and Featured Snippets which have been problematic in recent months. Updated algorithms should help to ensure more authoritative pages receive greater prominence, while low-quality content is demoted. Vice president of engineering at Google Search, Ben Gomes, admits that people have been trying to "game" the system -- working against the spirit of the purpose of algorithms -- to push poor-quality content and fake news higher up search results. He says that the problem now is the "spread of blatantly misleading, low quality, offensive or downright false information." google news search ← You may like to read: → Antivirus Webroot Deletes Windows Files, Causes Serious Problems For Users Silicon Valley Investors Call For California To Secede From the US After Trump Win Twitters Says It Will Ban Trump If He Breaks Hate-Speech Rules Ask Slashdot: Would You Recommend Updating To Windows 10?

Back in the day (mid 90s) most everyone was certain that search engines could never be very useful. Lycos, Altavista, etc. weren't terrible, but they also weren't very good, because although they could effectively spider the whole web that just meant that any search matched thousands or millions of pages, and they had no way to determine which of those were the best answers for the query. The "smart money" was betting on Yahoo!'s approach of manually curating enormous lists of links. Then Larry Page's pagerank algorithm found an excellent (not perfect, but excellent) way to figure out which of all of those answers were likely to be the best ones. That insight launched Google. It took off precisely because it provided better answers, rather than just returning a list of everything that was on the Internet. A list of everything on the Internet is not useful.

The ranking may have been tweaked, but you were still searching for actual text and actual search terms. Somewhere around 2005 or so, it became possible for Google to serve up top hits that no longer contained the literal search terms. At that point it ceased to be a "pure" search engine and became about trying to guess what you wanted rather than just retrieving pages with your text. As the years went by, Google deprecated and screwed up the plus operator, increasingly screwed up verbatim search until it became nonfunctional for people who just want a literal search, and incorporated "personalization" to serve up pages more like other pages you've viewed, rather than what you literally asked for.

This change improves the quality of translation in a single jump than seen in the last 10 years combined,” Google said in a release. Google also announced the extension of neural machine translation to Chrome browser’s built-in auto-translate functionality to web content, making full-page translations more accurate and easier to read. “India today has 234 million Indian language users who’re online, compared with 175 million English web users. We expect another 300 million Indian language users to come online in the next four years. With today’s launch, we’re taking a huge step forward to bring down the barriers that stop language users to get more out of the internet and also help the industry solve for the needs of billion Indians,” said Rajan Anandan, V-P, India & South East Asia, Google, sharing insights from Google-KPMG’s joint report “Indian Languages — Defining India’s Internet”. The new translation capability will also be available to users on Google Search and Maps, both on mobile and desktop. “With this update, millions of reviews – from restaurants to cafes or hotels – will appear in the language selected by the users on their device in addition to the original language of the review,” it said. With the Google-KPMG report expecting nine out of 10 new online users as Indian language use, it has also extended support to cover all 22 Scheduled Indian languages and rolled out new Gboard (keyboard for Android launched in December 2016) with transliteration support for Hindi, Bengali, Telugu, Marathi, Tamil, Urdu, and Gujarati, which will allow users to search and use Google Translate on keyboards. Users can also opt for Hinglish language with new text editing tool that makes it easier to select, copy, paste and repositioning the keyboard so it fits into the hand and texting style.

Photograph: Guardian Design Team Wikipedia Shortcuts From Wikitribune to StopFake: the battle against fake news Jimmy Wales has launched a new site and Google is changing its algorithm – but they’re not the only ones offering innovative solutions to combat fake news online Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Emine Saner @eminesaner Tuesday 25 April 2017 13.27 EDT Last modified on Tuesday 25 April 2017 17.00 EDT It was Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway’s assertion that there were “alternative facts” that did it for Jimmy Wales. The Wikipedia founder has set up a site that will attempt to tackle the growing proliferation of fake news. Like the established online encyclopedia, Wikitribune will rely on a volunteer fact-checking community – peer-reviewed news if you like – but they will be collaborating with professional journalists, paid for by crowdfunding. The site, which launches today, is described as “news by the people for the people”. At the same time, Google has announced it is to combat fake news by identifying misleading or offensive content (thanks to reports from users) and changing its algorithm to stop fake news being so prominent in search results. It will promote more authoritative and authentic content – much like these existing fake-news fighters: Google acts against fake news on search engine Read more The urban-myths experts At the time of writing, the top story on fact-checking website Snopes’s list of Top 50 rumours was about whether Trump had an incident of diarrhoea while on a golf course (and wearing white trousers), with a photograph purported to show he had. It was fake – the site found the original, undoctored image. The site, which started in 1994 to examine urban myths, uses a team of fact-checkers and editors. Facebook’s fake news ‘solution’ This week, Facebook’s chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg said the social media giant was not “an arbiter of the truth”. She was repeating words used by Mark Zuckerberg just after the US election, when the site was severely criticised for the amount of fake news that was allowed to spread, and the way the site’s algorithms amplified it (fake news is compelling and likely to go viral in the way that boring old, well-sourced, fact-checked news isn’t – and advertisers like things that get a lot of eyeballs). It has introduced a number of measures, such as a guide for users in how to spot fake news, and is introducing a “disputed” tag on stories. Users flag a story that is then sent to third-party fact-checkers. Critics have said this tag simply makes a story sound “like a bar debate” rather than seriously debunking a deliberate attempt to mislead. Fake news bulletins In Ukraine, where Russian propaganda has been a long-term problem, there is a weekly broadcast of the show StopFake News, which contains only that week’s fake news. “We discuss the stories, and if an editor says, ‘Can we disprove this? Is this a lie?’ then, yes, we can use it,” says the show’s presenter, Margo Gontar. “It is investigative journalism, with a twist.” Fakery-busting vigilantes Honourable mention goes to the individuals righting wrongs. On Twitter, @PicPedant (“punctilious internet killjoy at the forefront of the New Debunkonomy”) is one example of an account that uncovers fake and unattributed photographs.

This particular website and several other similar websites have been created to assist the individuals seeking for an effective SEO package and also to guide them how to avoid the various scams involved with it. Search Engine Optimization, with the abbreviated form SEO, is the most common promotional tool in the digital space. It is the method or series of actions that lead to a higher ranking of the websites on the search engine pages like Google, Bing, Yahoo and others. SEO service providers follow a certain mechanism to increase the potential of a particular website that allows it to show in the top 10 in Google rankings. There are numerous SEO service providers, corporate entities and freelancers who provide these kinds of services at different rates. Although there is no guarantee to achieve a top ranking in Google pages within a limited time and budget. However, a higher rank is achievable over a period of time with the help of the right SEO service package. Seopackagereviews.com is one of the top websites online to provide an authentic review and guidance about hiring the right people to get the most effective SEO link packages. The online world is polluted with false claimers, spammers and cheaters who claim to give you top rankings within a stipulated time. But actually, there are very few genuine SEO experts who actually know how to do it. When you express your requirement and wish to promote your website and get it ranked within the top most searches, you will face various types of SEO people to choose from.   Firstly you will come across the SEO charmers, who will connect with you immediately and try to cast a spell on you with their sugary sweet tone and they will guarantee the best service and push you hard to buy their services.

They are the knowledgeable SEO people with a more professional approach. They can be bossy sometimes dictating you what to do and what not to do. Usually, these people are neither pushy nor too sales and are confident about their expertise. Otherwise, they can be polite and guide you through the processes and give you a clear picture of everything. These are the people you need to be in touch in the long run. These people are the right ones who will help to achieve your target and assist you from time to time to make your website popular in the digital world. There are few more types of SEO people you might collide with during your hunting process.   Once, you are decided with the service provider, you need to do a bit of study before closing the deal.  Please be aware of the various scams in the online world and spend some time and effort not allowing the frauds to steal your money with false commitments. There are several online forums and reviews for SEO service reviews that will give you a clear understanding. Check out if there is any scam or dissatisfied customer associated with the SEO provider. Ask for previous work samples, credentials and testimonials from the SEO service provider. If possible, check out their client’s website and rankings. Also, call them up to verify their experience and the level of satisfaction. Before making the payment, read the documents, terms and conditions (if any) thoroughly provided by the SEO provider’s end. Finally, while making the payment, make sure you use credit cards for online payment or other secured payment options to avoid any fraudulent activities.

Howard not Christian McCaffrey Methodist court takes up challenge to election of gay Colorado bishop Karen Oliveto Milbank: At Capitol Hill “joint session,” prayers go unanswered SAN FRANCISCO — Google has sprinkled some new ingredients into its search engine in an effort to prevent bogus information and offensive suggestions from souring its results. The changes have been in the works for four months, but Google hadn’t publicly discussed most of them until now. The announcement in a blog post Tuesday reflects Google’s confidence in a new screening system designed to reduce the chances that its influential search engine will highlight untrue stories about people and events, a phenomenon commonly referred to as “fake news.” “It’s not a problem that is going to go all the way to zero, but we now think we can stay a step ahead of things,” said Ben Gomes, Google’s vice president of engineering for search. Correcting Autocomplete Besides taking steps to block fake news from appearing in its search results, Google also has reprogrammed a popular feature that automatically tries to predict what a person is looking for as a search request as being typed. The tool, called “autocomplete,” has been overhauled to omit derogatory suggestions, such as “are women evil,” or recommendations that promote violence. Google also adding a feedback option that will enable users to complain about objectionable autocomplete suggestions so a human can review the wording. Facebook, where fake news stories and other hoaxes have widely circulated on its social network, also has been trying to stem the tide of misleading information by working with The Associated Press and other news organizations to review suspect stories and set the record straight when warranted. Facebook also has provided its nearly 2 billion users ways to identify posts believed to contain false information, something that Google is now allowing users of its search engine to do for some of the news snippets featured in its results. Why Google Cares Related Articles April 13, 2017 Facebook buys full-page ads in Germany in battle with fake news March 7, 2017 Graves: “Fake news” isn’t new — it goes back to at least 1927 Google began attacking fake news in late December after several embarrassing examples of misleading information appeared near the top of its search engine. Among other things, Google’s search engine pointed to a website that incorrectly reported then President-elect Donald Trump had won the popular vote in the U.S. election , that President Barack Obama was planning a coup and that the Holocaust never occurred during World War II. Only about 0.25 percent of Google’s search results were being polluted with falsehoods, Gomes said. But that was still enough to threaten the integrity of a search engine that processes billions of search requests per day largely because it is widely regarded as the internet’s most authoritative source of information. “They have a lot riding on this, reputation wise,” said Lucy Dalglish, who has been tracking the flow of false information as dean of the University of Maryland’s journalism department. “If your whole business model is based turning up the best search results, but those results turn up stuff that is total crap, where does that get you?” To address the problem, Google began revising the closely guarded algorithms that generate its search with the help of 10,000 people who rate the quality and reliability of the recommendations during tests. Google also rewrote its 140-page book of rating guidelines that help the quality-control evaluators make their assessments. Google As Referee Fighting fake news can be tricky because in some cases what is viewed as being blatantly misleading by one person might be interpreted as being mostly true by another. If Google, Facebook or other companies trying to block false information err in their judgment calls, they risk being accused of censorship or playing favorites. But doing nothing to combat fake news would probably have caused even bigger headaches. If too much misleading information appears in Google’s search results, the damage could go beyond harm to its reputation for reliability. It could also spook risk-averse advertisers, who don’t want their brands tied to content that can’t be trusted, said Larry Chiagouris, a marketing professor at Pace University in New York. “Fake news is careening out of control in some people’s eyes, so advertisers are getting very skittish about it,” Chiagouris said. “Anything Google can do to show it is trying to put a lid on it and prevent it from getting out of hand, it will be seen as a good thing.” Although it also sells ads on its other services and independently owned websites, Google still makes most of its money from the marketing links posted alongside its search results. Google says its new approach isn’t meant to placate advertisers.

New Atlas Lifestyle Science Technology Transport Search Subscribe Computers Google applies the brakes to fake news Emily Ferron April 25, 2017 Today, Google gave an overview of its latest efforts to curb low-quality content like fake news and other misleading materials View gallery - 2 images In a fight against the type of "offensive or clearly misleading" results that make up about 0.25-percent of daily search traffic, Google has outlined new efforts to stymie the spread of fake news and other low-quality content like unexpected offensive materials, hoaxes and baseless conspiracy theories. The search giant's first line of defense against this uniquely 21st-century spread of misinformation is actually an old-fashioned one: human intelligence. You might think it's running completely on algorithms and AI these days, but Google actually has human evaluators that perform searches, assess the results and provide feedback back to the company. Google has updated the guidelines for this team of Search Quality Raters. Sick of Ads? More than 700 New Atlas Plus subscribers read our newsletter and website without ads. Join them for just US$19 a year.More Information Now, raters have more detailed instructions for identifying low-quality search results. The improved feedback from these human testers will then inform changes to Google's search algorithms, so false and misleading content appears lower in the results. Google has also fine-tuned underneath the hood. It has adjusted ranking signals specifically with the intention of demoting problematic content. As is typical of the more behind-the-scenes aspects of its ranking system, Google does not detail the specifics of these changes, but it did cite Holocaust denial results that appeared in December 2016 as an example of the type of problem it hopes to resolve. Lastly, there are also new direct feedback tools, through which users can flag problem content that appears in Google' Autocomplete and Featured Snippets features. These are tools that help you arrive more quickly at the content you're looking for, but since their content is generated automatically, it is sometimes problematic. A "Report inappropriate predictions" link now appears under the Google search box, and a "Feedback" option now appears below the featured Snippet. Google isn't the only major platform battling fake news – social media giant Facebook and other major tech companies are also funding solutions to curb the problem.

More big businesses joined the earnings parade Tuesday, saying their profits were even larger in the first three months of the year than analysts were expecting, including Caterpillar and McDonald’s. The gains put U.S. indexes on track to add to their big gains from Monday. Sign up for the online chat with Air Force Deputy CIO Bill Marion II on May 9, at 10 a.m. (EDT).

It’s the Nasdaq’s first move above 6,000 points. WELLS FARGO-ANGRY SHAREHOLDERS Wells Fargo executives apologize to shareholders PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Shareholders at Wells Fargo’s annual meeting in Florida took their speaking opportunity to criticize the company’s board of directors today. A shareholder representing the AFL-CIO called for the board to be voted out. Another speaker said there seems to be a “culture of dishonesty” at the company and elsewhere. Chairman Stephen Sanger said Wells Fargo has been held accountable and has made changes. Regulators imposed $185 million fines on the bank in September, saying employees opened up to 2 million customer accounts without customer permission as workers tried to meet aggressive sales goals. ‘If you’re a really good federal worker, you should welcome’ the reorganization plan, OMB says Today is the bank’s first shareholder meeting since the scandal erupted. CONSUMER CONFIDENCE US consumer confidence dips in April but remains strong WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. consumer confidence slipped in April but remains at high levels. The Conference Board, a business research group, says its consumer confidence index registered 120.3 this month, down from 124.9 in March, which was the highest reading in 16 years. Americans’ assessment of current conditions and their expectations for the future both dipped this month. Their outlook for the jobs market also dimmed. Still, consumers’ spirits have risen sharply since the Nov. 8 election of President Donald Trump. “Despite April’s decline, consumers remain confident that the economy will continue to expand in the months ahead,” said Lynn Franco, the Conference Board’s director of economic indicators. Economists closely monitor the mood of consumers because their spending accounts for about 70 percent of U.S. economic activity. HOME PRICES US home prices rose at the fastest pace in nearly 3 years WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. homes prices rose steadily upward in February as more homebuyers chased fewer available properties. The Standard & Poor’s CoreLogic Case-Shiller national home price index increased 5.8 percent in February, the most in 32 months. Home sales got off to a strong start this year, and in March reached their highest level in a decade. At the same time, the number of houses for sale has dropped steadily, forcing many would-be buyers into bidding wars. Many homeowners have very low mortgage rates and may be reluctant to sell if doing so would force them to take on higher borrowing costs. The cities with the biggest annual price gains were Seattle; Portland, Oregon; and Dallas. TRUMP-TRADE REPRESENTATIVE Senate panel approves Trump’s choice to lead trade office WASHINGTON (AP) — A Senate panel has unanimously approved President Donald Trump’s pick to represent the U.S. in trade negotiations. The 26-0 vote by the Finance Committee moves the nomination of Robert Lighthizer to the full Senate. Lighthizer served as deputy U.S. trade representative under President Ronald Reagan. He has also worked on trade issues as a lawyer representing various manufacturers and high-tech companies. The committee also approved granting Lighthizer a waiver from a law that prohibits anyone who has represented a foreign entity in trade negotiations with the U.S. from being the nation’s top trade representative. Democrats agreed to the waiver after earning commitments from Chairman Orrin Hatch to work with them to protect coal miners’ health care benefits as part of a spending bill to keep the government running. J CREW-JOB CUTS J.Crew to cut 150 jobs with sales in retreat NEW YORK (AP) — J.Crew, the preppy clothing retailer, will cut about 150 jobs to trim costs. Like other retailers, J.Crew has suffered as more people shop online. The company has lost money for the past three years. Most of the job cuts will be at its corporate headquarters in New York. It will also not fill about 100 corporate positions that were open. The changes will save it about $30 million a year, and the company says it will post a charge of about $10 million in the first quarter due to severance payments and other termination costs. The company has more than 570 J.Crew, Madewell and outlet stores. FIAT CHRYSLER-GOOGLE FCA, Google begin offering rides in self-driving cars DETROIT (AP) — Fiat Chrysler and Google for the first time will offer rides to the public in the self-driving vehicles they are building under an expanding partnership. The companies announced in the spring of last year that they would build 100 self-driving Chrysler Pacifica hybrid minivans. Those vehicles have been tested in Arizona, California and Michigan. Waymo, Google’s self-driving car project, says it will allow hundreds of people in Phoenix to take rides in the vehicles so that it can get feedback. People can apply on Waymo’s website. The company also says it’s expanding its fleet to 500 Pacifica hybrids. IVANKA TRUMP The Latest: Ivanka Trump ‘rather unfamiliar’ with new role BERLIN (AP) — Ivanka Trump says she’s still “rather unfamiliar” with the role of first daughter and is stressing that, as a White House adviser, she doesn’t represent her business. Trump stepped away from running her fashion brand to take the unpaid White House role. At a panel discussion in Berlin Tuesday, the moderator asked Trump whether she represents her father, President Donald Trump, the American people or her business. Ivanka Trump replied, “Certainly not the latter, and I am rather unfamiliar with this role as well, as it is quite new to me.” She said, “it has been a little under 100 days but it has just been a remarkable, incredible journey.” TRUMP-TOWER-CHICAGO Many condominiums for sale, rent at Chicago’s Trump Tower CHICAGO (AP) — An unusually large number of luxury condominiums are for sale or available for rent at Trump Tower in Chicago. Real estate professionals tell the Chicago Tribune (http://trib.in/2oFJmqy) that almost 11 percent of the 98-story building’s 486 residential units are for sale. Chicago demonstrators have focused on the building since Donald Trump was elected president. Carla Walker of KoenigRubloff Berkshire Hathaway says owners who paid upward of $1.5 million for their condos don’t want to be disturbed by protesters. Appraisal Research Counselors says the number of Trump Tower condos for sale is almost three times higher than at similar buildings downtown. The 100-story John Hancock building has 26 out of 703 condos for sale. GOOGLE-FIGHTING FALSE INFORMATION Google targets ‘fake news,’ offensive search suggestions SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Google has sprinkled some new ingredients into its search engine in an effort to prevent bogus information and offensive suggestions from souring its results. The changes have been in the works for four months, but Google hadn’t publicly discussed most of them until now. The announcement in a blog post Tuesday reflects Google’s confidence in a new screening system designed to reduce the chances that its influential search engine will highlight untrue stories about people and events, a phenomenon commonly referred to as “fake news.” UKRAINE Russia to supply power to rebel-controlled eastern Ukraine MOSCOW (AP) — The Kremlin says Russia will supply electricity to separatist-controlled areas in eastern Ukraine after the Ukrainian government cut off the power because of unpaid bills. Ukraine says it will stop supplying power to the rebel-controlled part of the Luhansk region because of mounting debts, and local media report the supply was cut off close to midnight Monday. Boris Gryzlov, the Russian envoy mediating talks between Russia-backed separatists and the Ukrainian government, says the Russian government has decided to help supply Luhansk with electricity. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov defends the decision as a humanitarian mission but will not disclose how the power supply will be organized in this Ukrainian region that borders Russia. EUROPE-SWEDISH TELECOMS EU investigators probe Swedish mobile telecoms firms BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union’s competition watchdog says investigators have launched surprise inspections at a number of Swedish mobile telecoms companies amid concerns over a possible cartel. The European Commission says inspections are a first step in the investigation of anti-competitive practices. It has not named any of the companies targeted. The inspections are helping to establish whether “Swedish mobile network operators may have engaged in anti-competitive conduct preventing entry into the consumer segment of the Swedish mobile telecommunications market, in breach of EU antitrust rules.” The Commission notes that the surprise inspections do not mean the companies are guilty of any misconduct. No deadline has been set to end the probe. ITALY-ALITALIA Alitalia expected to start bankruptcy procedures ROME (AP) — Alitalia is expected to start bankruptcy procedures after employees rejected proposed salary cuts and layoffs cuts aimed at saving Italy’s financially troubled flagship airline. The company’s board says that “given the impossibility of recapitalization” it has decided to “begin procedures foreseen by law,” a reference to extraordinary administration. An Alitalia statement says the board will meet Thursday to discuss the move. Such a scenario could result in shedding unprofitable routes, likely domestic ones, and selling off airliners. In results announced Monday, some two-thirds of employees in a referendum nixed the industrial plan the government had linked to Alitalia’s survival. TYSON FOODS-ACQUISITION Tyson foods to buy AdvancePierre for $3.2 billion NEW YORK (AP) — Tyson Foods will pay $3.2 billion to add packaged sandwich maker AdvancePierre to its stable of processed food brands. Tyson will pay $40.25 per share, a 9.8 percent premium to AdvancePierre’s closing share price Monday. Tyson Foods Inc. will also assume about $1.1 billion in debt from the Blue Ash, Ohio, company. The deal is expected to close in the third quarter. Tyson is shifting its portfolio to incorporate a heavier emphasis on proteins. On Monday, Tyson said that it might sell its Sara Lee frozen bakery business, its Kettle brand and Van’s. Tyson, based in Springdale, Arkansas, owns the Jimmy Dean and Ball Park brands, SHIP REPAIR-LAYOFFS EXPECTED Hampton Roads’ ship industry could lay off more than 1,000 NORFOLK, Va. (AP) — The ship-repair industry in Virginia’s Hampton Roads region is preparing to lay off more than 1,000 employees as Congress works to approve a new national budget. The Virginian Pilot reports (http://bit.ly/2pdH7vN ) at least 1,000 layoffs are expected for the industry and some have already begun. Virginia Ship Repair Association president Bill Crow says it’s mainly due to the federal government’s stopgap spending measure that ends Friday, and the failure to approve a new national budget with adequate funding for maintenance of Navy ships. Crow says without supplemental funding, Hampton Roads’ ship repair industry could stand to lose roughly $180 million. He also says shipyard executives knew that even without Congress’ funding issues, the work the Navy planned to offer Hampton Roads’ facilities would drop below their total capacity.

"The platform internet businesses are sucking up a lot of oxygen out of the room. Facebook, Google, the big internet companies, they are making it really hard for smaller internet businesses to be able to build distribution," he said. Mehta said larger companies have such a strong hold on the market that it's nearly impossible for small consumer internet companies to build audiences. "You see it with Snapchat today. Instagram Stories has taken off like a rocket ship. It leaves question marks on whether Snapchat will reaccelerate growth, and [Instagram is] a business as big as Snapchat," he said. The dominance of tech giants in the space has also made things more difficult for investors. "The internet is tougher," said Mehta. "There's a lot of capital sitting on the sidelines, and all of us are looking for great ideas and places to put our money."

Waymo, Alphabet’s self-driving division, is asking residents of the Phoenix area to apply to participate in its early-rider program. The program will let early riders and their families ride in Waymo’s driverless vehicles for free. The program finally lets real people test Google’s technology, which it has been working on since 2009. “Over the course of this trial, we’ll be accepting hundreds of people with diverse backgrounds and transportation needs who want to ride in and give feedback about Waymo’s self-driving cars,” said John Crafcik, CEO of Waymo, in a blog post Monday. “Rather than offering people one or two rides, the goal of this program is to give participants access to our fleet every day, at any time, to go anywhere within an area that’s about twice the size of San Francisco.” The program is open to residents in the Phoenix metropolitan area, including Chandler, Tempe, Mesa and Gilbert. The riders will have access to Waymo’s Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivans and Lexus RX450h hybrid crossovers, according to the program’s website. Uber — which Google was an early investor in but has become its bitter rival in driverless tech — beat Google to bringing self-driving tests to the public. Uber began a public test in Pittsburgh last year. Uber is also testing a service in Tempe, where one of its vehicles was involved in a rollover crash last month. Crafcik told Bloomberg the early riders in the Arizona program will ride in the passenger’s seat, while contract or employee testers will sit in the driver’s seat of the self-driving cars, although the eventual goal is to not have them there. Crafcik said Waymo is also adding 500 Chrysler minivans to its fleet because it wants “to bring self-driving cars to more communities sooner.”   Photo: John Krafcik, CEO of Waymo, the autonomous vehicle company created by Google parent company Alphabet, introduces a Chrysler Pacifica hybrid outfitted with Waymo’s suite of sensors and radar at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit on Jan. 8, 2017.

EXCLUSIVE: AndroidPolice.com's Nexus One Is Running Android 2.2 Froyo. How Fast Is It Compared To 2.1? Oh, Only About 450% Faster Artem Russakovskii Follow View All Posts 2010/05/11 7:41pm PDTMay 11, 2010 3 Plus 1 on G+ 583 Share on Facebook 10 Share on Twitter Total Shares586 Exclusives HTC News Nexus One (Passion) Article Contents 1 Upcoming Frozen Goodness 2 Froyo 2.2 Performance 2.1 Linpack 2.2 Linpack Scores 2.3 Froyo Linpack Score 3 Conclusion Upcoming Frozen Goodness Folks, we have a Nexus One. We also have Froyo. In fact, we have the two mixed together in the most delicious frozen-yogurty Android 2.2 kind of way you can imagine. Not much has been officially released by Google about Android 2.2 - probably less than any other release to date. We all have a hunch about some new features but Google wouldn't officially confirm or deny any of them, other than the one about Flash 10.1. They're saving it for May 19th-20th, and we're OK with that. However, one of our team members has been playing with a Nexus One running Froyo for about a week now, getting more and more visibly excited every day. Before we proceed, however, here's a quick picture to squelch any non-believers. These are not fakes and we will be playing with the phone on video very shortly. Yes, it runs Flash, and it runs it very well (we'll demo that separately but you can get the idea here). As you've seen it already, it has a new home screen menu but we won't talk about that today. Froyo 2.2 Performance Today, we would like to point out the results of some speed tests we've been running on Froyo, using a tool called Linpack. These results are so impressive, most likely due to the introduction of the long awaited JIT compilation into the kernel, that we felt they deserved immediate attention. Linpack Linpack for Android was specifically created to test the performance of Dalvik VM which, in short, is the heart and the brains of Android. The benchmark calculates how fast your phone can operate, which can then be used to compare various phone models' relative performance. Linpack allows users to publish these results to its online tracker, but we'll talk about that a bit later. Here's a brief introduction to Linpack by the authors themselves, with interesting parts bolded: The LINPACK Benchmarks are a measure of a system’s floating point computing power. Introduced by Jack Dongarra, they measure how fast a computer solves a dense N by N system of linear equations Ax = b, which is a common task in engineering. The solution is obtained by Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting, with 2/3*N3 + 2*N2 floating point operations. The result is reported in Millions of FLoating-point Operations Per Second (MFLOP/s, sometimes simply called FLOPS). This test is more a reflection of the state of the Android Dalvik Virtual Machine than of the floating point performance of the underlying processor. Software written for an Android device is written using Java code that the Dalvik VM interprets at run time.  What is the purpose of this app? This is a simple benchmark test to show performance relative to other phones for a standard calculation.  Linpack has been used for years on all types of computers, with a version used to rate the TOP500 computers in the world. What speed is better? A higher number is better. Does having faster speed improve the android phones or what? Yes, it should.  The Dalvik VM has a huge impact on the Linpack number.  A better number on the same device would indicate that a new version update has improved performance.  Or it could show that something has gone terribly wrong if the number goes down. But enough about Linpack - let's take a look at how Froyo performs. Linpack Scores Just so you have an idea of the kind of scores you can expect from the benchmark, let me list a few sample numbers: the Nexus One running Android 2.1 gets about 6.5-7 MFLOPS my HTC Hero averages a measly score of about 2 MFLOPS (the phone is pretty slow indeed) Here is a screenshot of the last test I ran on the Hero: Froyo Linpack Score So how does the Nexus One with Froyo do? A whopping 37.5 MFLOPS. Think about this for a second. 37.6, compared to 6.5-7 - that's about a 450% speed improvement. Conclusion Things are starting to finally come together. Flash and huge performance gains, all in the same release. Flash is CPU hungry, so Android makes everything about the environment more efficient. Do you see it? Adobe wasn't giving Apple what they needed, and Apple wasn't giving Adobe, well, anything. But Google thought of the problem outside the box, like the ingenious engineers to the core that they are and made Android so much faster than it could finally run full Flash without a hitch. Oh yeah, the phone is indeed noticeably faster. Some of you (like Cyanogen and Uhhhh) pointed out that JIT compilation only helps programs that are not compiled to native code, which Flash and some video codecs/drivers seem to be. Thank you for this clarification. While real-life improvements will most certainly not be 450% across the board, we still expect the N1 and even Flash to benefit from JIT because, as other programs become more efficient, more CPU will be available to such natively compiled programs. These mysterious numbers from the Linpack Top 10 don't look so fake anymore now, do they? Tags android 2.1 Android 2.2 breaking exclusive froyo linpack performance subscribe ...

I've just downloaded Linpack, run it and got 4.761. I'm on AT&T network, but it shouldn't matter, right? I don't know how to get a screenshot on my Nexus, unfortunately. Artem Russakovskii Actually, I never said 2MFLOPS was on the N1 - it was on my HTC Hero. The N1 was 6.5-7MFLOPS. vkelman OK, my mistake. Hero image and Nexus 2.2 image are located together, and there is no Nexus 2.1 image nearby - it was easy to make a mistake in 3:00 am :) But then, why my is Nexus One so slow? (4.76 vs. 6.5-7) Artem Russakovskii Yeah, sorry for the confusion - didn't have the N1 image handy, so had to go with Hero only. Not sure why your N1 is so slow, perhaps it's running a bunch of stuff in the background? Brantyr Run the test again and again, takes a few runs to get everything cached for maximum speed. Putting it into aeroplane mode helps make sure the CPU isn't interrupted to respond to network traffic as well. And obviously make sure nothing else is running in the background. Vladimir Kelman Artem, is there some kind of limitation on a depth of the thread here? I wanted to reply to your image below, but it has no "Reply" link to me. Anyway, I rebooted my N1 phone and measured MFLOPS again. At first it gave me even less (about 4), but the next moment I measured it again and got 6 MFLOPS. So, it wary greatly, not sure - why. And yes, I have 3 security apps running in the background (Lockout, Wave Secure, and Mobile Defence) mainly because I couldn't choose one and trying to evaluate them. Salman Hasan My nexus one reads 6.8 MFLOPS. I Have not switched to airplane mode or anything. All I do is I use ES File Explorer and use the task manager to kill Applications; I have about 106 MB free on my RAM Harsha S Did U try 2.2 on HTC Hero. If not why not..? Try porting it to HTC Hero or Leak that ROM to some Devs..?? Would be a nice feeling to here that it runs on Hero too with higher MFLOPs.. what say..? Kr0nos The Screen is from the Hero. I hope 2.2 comes to my Magic // MT3G - by SuperF or cyanogen And I just flashed cyanogen 2.1 ROM yesterday :P Vanquish The score 2.009 MFLOPs is from his HTC hero, not from N1. Uhhhh So, fp operations are faster ... that's about all this says. Flash is very unlikely to be running within dalvik (it'd be running native under Linux) hence it'd be unaffected by these improvements... Artem Russakovskii Cyanogen pointed this out earlier today - as I'm not the biggest pro in low level Android implementation, I didn't know this - a correction/update will be posted ASAP. But such a boost in floating point operations is very important, don't you think? Think games and apps that will now be faster. Gambit Except, of course, that most games aren't implemented in Java (Well, *I* am, but I'm provably nuts) and those that are, don't use FP, they use fixed point mathematics. Sorry. Nexus One Forum Wow awesome testing. Will link to this post with a front page article tomorrow! Thanks. Sachin if this is true i will sell my iPhone on ebay piprog I would probably first compare apples to apples. Android is a Java platform, while iPhone OS is native. This current improvement most probably only means that Android performance was up until now so terrible, that such an improvement was possible (although respect to the engineers achieving it!), and is now approaching iPhone performance (from the rear, I suppose). JJJ What are you smoking piprog...??? I've got the latest iPod Touch and an HTC Incredible (do you even own an Android device?). I used to have a WinMo phone (Samsung Omnia) and I liked using the iPod Touch for email and browsing instead of my phone. However, now that I have the Incredible I use it for email and browsing since it's faster and does a better job than the iPod Touch...and that's with Android 2.1. piprog hi JJJ, the Incredible is state of the art, no arguments about that. Will be interesting how iPhone 4 with matching cpu and with the new iPhone OS 4 will stack up (performance wise; no chance feature wise, though), but it is true that now there is at least one Android phone that is a real contender, which is good for both platforms, I'd say :-) Jimlad lol piprog, apple os was designed for the hardware, considering that the iPhone has it's bollocks cut off to make it appear faster then it is a mighty thing that android is so much more capable and faster t'boot :p piprog hi Jimlad, more capable: sure (v.s. non-geek usability;-). But faster? Is there any conclusive evidence out there? Of course Incredible & co now has a much faster processor, but on similar hardware e.g. Safari seems to be faster. John Thompson Flash may not be directly dependant on FP operations, but it is a significant increase that will see the speed of many apps increase. Definitely great to see these behind the scene improvements coming with Froyo, bring on May 19th! tripplethrendo Will i be able to get 2.2 on the Eris? dextroz go back to sleep. you are just getting 2.1. eris will never got 2.2 since it's end of life is next month. cece Can you see if RAM usage also increased with JIT ?? Might be the problem with first gen phones with low RAM available. Jason Porter The way this test is done for MFLOPS is interesting for a "top of the stack" bench, but doesn't tell us much about the actual capability of the hardware. If you get a moment, can you see if it's possible to check the kernel log for the BogoMIPS value? On most linux systems this is at /var/log/messages but it may be somewhere odd on an Android system. BogoMIPS is evaluated for the processor(s) each time the kernel is loaded, and it's part of the default output log. It's not a particularly meaningful number in terms of application performance, but it will give a degree of comparability for the hardware itself. Frank Downloaded linpack for my Nexus One and got MFLOPS 6.691 Richard Great! If Android Police has a build of Android Froyo, can they spoil the other features of Android Froyo before it releases? Grashalm The Just in Time Compiler is awesome stuff. I always thought they have it already ;-) Desktop Java was known to be really slow, but then came the JIT and benchmarks were somewhere near C++. Not directly compiling to native code is great, since it enables performance optimizations even for already (bytecode) compiled applications. Also it can leverage all the target CPU options without recompling. (Mobile CPUs compared to desktop CPUs are pretty different) Oscar Maybe the increased performance of floating point operations are due to android finally being able to access the NEON and VFPv3 instrucions on the Snapdragon (called VeNum)? If that's the case, flash, video decoding and everything else will run better as well. Rogerio This is the iPHONE Killer! zeagus Oh, hey, there's this bridge I have for sale... phutwo These numbers are really low. Even if you don't use SIMD/Neon for floating point operation, you should be roughly 1 MFLOP per 1 MHertz. So for this phone it should say 1000 MFlop. Jason Porter This isn't a measure of the hardware's performance. This is a Java-specific benchmark used to measure the actual (observable) performance of the entire software stack, including the Dalvik VM. Remember, this is LinpackJava customized for Android, not Linpack in the traditional sense. If they were running real Linpack (in C) compiled for the underlying linux kernel, they'd be far closer to the hardware and these numbers would be much higher. Eamon Nerbonne ...and in any case it's simply not true that a 1MHertz processor can run linpack at 1mflop - even under the best of circumstances. Not all processors run 1 flop in 1 cycle (commonly, they don't) - some require extra latency between dependant read/writes, then there's the memory bandwidth and latency issues. It could also well be *faster* on a superscalar architecture with multiple ops in flight. Instruction mix can be a problem. In short, with a 1mhertz processor, you'd have an estimate for the order-of magnitude - but if you scored just 0.01Mflop on a 1MHertz machine, that might be odd, but not necessarily inconceivable. So yeah, using a 1GHz cpu and scoring 6-7 mflop in java on a phone running a GUI and network stack etc. that's not designed or optimized for linpack... ...is entirely reasonable, and not necessarily indicative of other performance metrics. phutwo So I was quite interested in why the numbers are so low (JVM+JIT is close to C). In x86, a fully-pipelined FPU, you can get 90% of theoretical performance depending on cache speed/size (or a factor of 2 if you don't have fused multiply/add). However, I stand corrected. Cortex A8 has an unpipelined floating point coprocessor! The VFP takes 18-21 cycles for an FMAC. So for a 1GHz processor, 40MFlops. So wow, if they are using the VFP in the JIT, they're hitting theoretical numbers and the interpreter/Java is free (bottleneck is fpu)! xvigour sorry but what you say is untrue, or I don't get your point. a core i7 (and cores before) is 4 flops/cycle. and a linpack can be 90+% efficient. so 1flops/cycle is easily reached. check the http://www.top500.org to be convinced Brantyr 37/7 ~= 520% not 450 (maybe leave the maths to the CPU :P)! Any way you slice it it's a crazy increase in speed, even running a JIT hack on cyanogenmod my Magic only goes from 2 to 3.6 MFLOPS - a rather paltry 180% increase in comparison!!! Artem Russakovskii Brantyr, 37/6.75 is about 550% but since we mention "faster", the original 100% is not counted, producing 450%. Think about what "100% faster" would mean and you'll see what I'm talking about. Brantyr Whoops, I see what you mean now, sorry! dj any noticeable changes to battery life under 2.2? have they reduced the amount of power needed by Android or is that just wishful thinking?? Artem Russakovskii Unfortunately, we cannot discuss this at the moment. You guys will probably have to wait until Google publicly announces Froyo. dj yeah, I thought that might be the case. thanks anyway Adam It's worth pointing out that Flash is not exactly the CPU hog, it is rich content in general. Look at some of the HTML5 demos on the Nexus One and let me know how that goes. I'll give you a hint, choppy typically (same, worse really, for the apphole product). So yes Flash does use a large amount of CPU but it is more based on the content being pushed through the application and not the application itself. Now if they opened up hardware decode for Ogg and h.264 we'd see some wicked fast stuff (not to mention better battery) Somebody Actually, flash IS just a turd. Try this: Measure CPU usage doing something with flash, and then measure CPU usage doing the *same thing* with native code. See the huge discrepancy? Flash is just a SLOW, UGLY memory hog, and has no place in this world. You can be assured that if flash shipped with AOSP or anyone's build of AOSP that I was interested in trying out, I would quite intentionally DELETE that component. Adam Nice job giving concrete examples. Further on the phone nothing is Native. If by native you mean C or other compiled code without a VM then of course it will run faster. If I have an API to the hardware for decoding for example (something safari did but other did not until now on the Mac) I would run faster. The whole notion of a VM implies things will not run as fast, you don't get abstraction for free. This is the issue with Droid itself half the time. Is there room for improvement in flash, yes, is flash a pig compared to similar products for the web, find me a similar product and we can talk b/c right now HTML 5 in the majority of the browsers is a pig too. Mike Will the Incredible with HTC sense be upgradable to froyo? Artem Russakovskii We don't have any information confirming this but I think it would be silly to assume that one of the newest and most powerful phones will not be supporting the next version. There are problems with HTC Sense and JIT that are currently present in custom ROMs but I'm sure HTC has been hard at work making the 2 compatible. Paul The CPU on the Hero is a dog, of course the number is lower. The 1 gig snapdragon is the fastest chip out there on a Android phone. michael hill How do I get my Droid to get a score like the one on the top 10. Right now I am averaging 4.5. I want 33. Please let me know. Thank u Adam Nabi Buy a new phone? How do I get my Fiat Punto to score like a Formula F1? Please let me know. Thank u Noodles Did you test to see if the new Nexus One will have a screen reader built in? Could a blind person use it without buying Steel or Standard Android, both of which don't allow users to text, email or surf the web? Sean Run the Sprint HTC Hero with an OC'ed 2.1 rom and JIT and you are looking at 4.8 MFLOPS Artem Russakovskii But no Sense, and I like my Sense (they're currently not compatible with each other, I believe). Sean Don't get me wrong I love Sense but I am finding way's around it. Artem Russakovskii Oh yeah? Is it noticeably faster? In which areas? Sean The boot time is faster, loading and unloading of apps is quicker. I mean it's not like going to a snapdragon cpu but sometimes just that little extra speed helps, like when opening cam to shoot something. The main thing is the OC'ed cpu though. Running nice at 767Mhz. Dody Suria Wijaya This is also can be interesting to compare mobile phone processors vs standard desktop/laptop cpu. Using linpack at this address: http://www.netlib.org/benchmark/linpackjava/LinpackJava.zip I got the following score (Intel T7500 2.2 GHz c2d) Mflops/s: 228.889 Time: 0.0 secs Norm Res: 1.43 Precision: 2.220446049250313E-16 or about 32x improvement over NexusOne :D Vidit Bhargava So...does wireless-n and FM radio get enabled when you installed Froyo? Dave Just ran the test on my N1. Getting 6.3 MFLOPS with everything still running in the background. CANT WAIT for 2.2!!! dave ran test on my desire 8.9 first run then 9.2 second run bring on 2.2 dave sorry it was 6.9 then 7.2 John Thompson I'd also love to see FM radio - hopefully if it isn't in stock 2.2, cyanogen will include it in his mod in the near future Max i'm still waiting for 2.1 on my HTC Hero...sigh Jason Porter I'm getting ~4.5 MFLOPS consistently on my Motorola Droid (standard 2.1, Verizon build). I'm very interested to see what JIT would do for this phone. Roach But the GUI is still ugly and the apps still suck. It's like having a fast Chevette. Somebody No, you're thinking of that fruity phone. This is ANDROID. j maz How can you download it? electronic cigarette Dude that type of speed is super promising. Bye bye iphone ;) prouddesireowner Hi, just read the thread...that's awesome! Did you get a chance to see if the apps2sd issue has been addressed yet? I'd love to see that fixed in froyo! --Android rules!-- Thomas I am also interested about Apps to SD. Thanks Quoth According to the issue tracker the status of that particular issue has been changed to 'FutureRelease', which means it's done and just needs to be released (http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=1151), presumably in Froyo. Claudio Ibarra I don't doubt the photo or the performance increase, but I have a question: If the photo reads "37.593" and the Linpack top 10 shows a range of 33.416 to 80.796, shouldn't one of the entry rows read "37.593" ? Artem Russakovskii Only if you specifically save it to their online db. Fábio I got 6.8 MFLOPS on my Android2.1/HTC Desire. Can't wait for the update!!!! ^_^ Fábio I got 6.9 MFPS on my HTC Desire / Android 2.1. And wow can't wait for the 2.2 update polkadots I cannot help but notice that the Droid did pretty darn well at about 34 MFLOPs for a 550+Mhz processor. I am using a Milestone but I reckon it should get about the same performance boost. Froyo!! Can't wait!! Đức Thành Hello, I'm from the futured. Here almost 5 years have passed, now we have phones with quad and octa-cores clocked at 2.6GHz and more to come soon. We have come so far. :DD Joshua So is the the thing that one of the exiting programmers said would "blow us away". I mean it's great and everything but i'm not sure it really has the "blow me away" factor considering that i really like the speed of my nexus one to begin with. I'm really interested in what's gonna be the best improvement jasim does any one know if it include arabic support? Priya That sounds weird. Anyways, now m interested to know if its faster then iPhone 4? Tetsuo I am not sure if Iphone 4 has a similar benchmarking tool, it would be nice to do a comparison, but Froyo is breathing new life to my old HTC Hero.. ;) It is clocking 4.17 MFlops on it running a custom rom ;) RoyBatty I just found another benchmark for Java performance on Android: caffeinemark. The great thing is that you can see how Froyo improves the results for a wide range of devices/ROMs ... on this website : http://www.flexycore.com/benchmark-database-access.html IT Rush Amazing, maybe I'll consider updating to this cool device asap.. Looks very interesting really! Dextroz Are you kidding me? This post is from a year ago! The Nexus One is now rocking Gingerbread 2.3. Do yourself a favor and get a Nexus S at this point instead. Đức Thành I'll take this opportunity to remind the both of you to get a Nexus 6 now instead, if you haven't already. :P IT Rush Wow, what an improvement.. can't wait to get one. Looks like it's time to drop my other phone and switch to this one eh. kia nice page I have learn a lot from this page very nice Đức Thành I'm thinking the same thing. kristen well its is faster then i.4 looks to me and but i.5 steels the race Jasa animasi flash Its fastest than iphone 4 wow its great pranav LINPACK benchmark helps a lot .. indeed xiaoying <div>Windows 7 tidlig vedtagelse beats Vista's 2 til 1</div> <div>I fem måneder siden dens udgivelse, har Windows 7 erobrede to gange de forbrug andel som  levis 501 sin forgænger, Vista, nås i den samme tidsperiode, et Web metrics selskab sagde i dag.Ifølge NetApplications.com i Aliso Viejo, Californien, Windows 7 tegnede sig for 9% af alle levis jeans uk  operativsystemer i levis commuter jeans   brug online for måned til sidste søndag.

We put the always-listening speaker's multiuser functionality to the test. Tyler Lizenby/CNET Smart Home by Andrew Gebhart April 25, 2017 9:14 AM PDT @GebAndrew Can Google really tell you apart from your significant other? Can Google tell your kids apart if they're the same gender and roughly the same age? Last week, the Google Home added support for multiple users in a much anticipated update. The always-listening smart speaker from the search giant uses voice recognition to customize responses to certain questions. This week, we put this multiuser functionality to the test. How to add multiple users to Google Home With multiuser support, the Google Home is now more personal than ever. It can now give personalized responses based on whose voice it hears. by Taylor Martin 2:21 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF What multiuser can do As a quick refresher, the Google Home is a smart speaker similar to the Amazon Echo. The Home has Google's assistant -- aptly called the Google Assistant -- built-in. Say the wake words, "OK, Google" or "Hey, Google" and you can ask the Home to play music, set a timer, search the internet or control your smart home. 18 Here's everything the Google Home can do The Google Assistant can even use info from other Google apps -- such as Maps and Calendar -- to personalize responses if you ask about things like your daily schedule or the traffic conditions on your way to work. The Home's recent update allows multiple people to link their Google account to a Home. After each person trains the Home by saying the wake words "OK, Google" and "Hey, Google" a few times, the speaker should start to recognize individual voices and respond accordingly with the appropriate calendar, traffic info, or even customized playlist. Putting voice recognition to the test Google Home updates New smart home partners Google Home at CES Google Home vs Amazon Echo We wanted to see how well this voice recognition works in practice. The Google Home supports up to six accounts simultaneously, so we had six people go through the setup process -- four males, and two females -- to see if it could reliably tell us all apart. The results were mostly favorable. Google never mixed up the two females. Of the males -- Rich Brown, Steve Conaway, Chance Lane and myself -- it correctly identified myself and Rich every time. The Google Home successfully identified Steve roughly 80 percent of the time. On a couple of tests, it didn't recognize Steve's voice at all; in another test, it thought Steve was Rich. Chance had less success -- the Home thought Chance was Steve about half of the time, didn't recognize Chance a handful of other times, and only got Chance's voice right a couple of times. Chance even tried retraining the Assistant, but his results did not improve. Not meant for security Enlarge Image Read the disclaimer at the bottom before you allow the Google Home access to your info. Screenshot by Ry Crist/CNET The Home app you use to set up multiple accounts warns you that the tech isn't perfect yet. As you train the Google Assistant, you see the disclaimer "a similar voice or recording might be able" to trick the Home. When the feature launched, I asked a Google rep if the company was going to use voice recognition to add security features. For instance, if the Google Home knows who's talking, it could unlock your August Smart Lock, and you wouldn't have to worry about a stranger giving the same command. The rep confirmed over email that the company's voice recognition wasn't robust enough to allow this yet, and our testing bore that out. Tricking Google We were able to get Google to respond to a recording of Steve's voice -- the voice recognition is based on the wake words, so someone could access your info if they had a clip of you saying "OK, Google." We tried splitting up commands. Steve said "Hey, Google" and I followed with "what's my name?" Google responded with Steve's name. When we flipped it, the Home responded with mine. Additionally, another coworker was successfully able to impersonate my voice. Even in terms of basic convenience, the feature isn't perfect yet -- the Home still can't integrate multiple accounts for a single user, such as a home and work account. A solid first step Still, taken for what it is -- a convenient way for multiple family members to check personal info -- the Home's voice recognition works well. As long as no one in your family sounds too similar, the Home will reliably be able to tell people apart and provide appropriate customized responses. But heed Google's warnings, and don't expect perfect voice recognition from the Home yet. And do not give the Home access to info you want kept private.

Diane Greene delivers a keynote during Google Next '17 last month. Advertisement Google is well positioned to compete and even surpass Amazon Web Services in public cloud during the next half-decade, the head of Google’s cloud division told a weekend gathering of tech leaders. The public cloud arm of tech giant Alphabet is in the midst of a rapid, multi-year expansion that included bringing on Diane Greene as senior vice president of Google Cloud in November of 2015. Related 2017 MSP 501 Worldwide List and Rankings - Enter Now! Data Sheds Light on MSP’s Favorite Vendors. During a question and answer session at the Forbes CIO Summit in Half Moon Bay on Sunday, Greene suggested the fast-growing Google Cloud Platform is poised to leapfrog competitors AWS, Microsoft Azure and IBM Cloud, all of which currently have a larger share of public cloud market.   “I think we have a pretty good shot at being No. 1 in five years,” she’s quoted as telling the group, according to an article at Forbes.com. AWS has long been the market leader in public cloud, followed by Microsoft and IBM. All of the companies are seeing dramatic growth in cloud earnings. Greene told the audience that, in many respects, the scale is tipped in Google’s favor, but acknowledged that the company must continue to execute. “I actually think we have a huge advantage in our data centers, in our infrastructure, availability, security and how we automate things,” Greene continued. “We just haven’t packaged it perfectly yet.” In March of 2016, Alphabet announced it was pouring tens of billions of dollars into Google Cloud, and expanding the number of global data centers from three to 15 by the end of 2017. Last month, Google announced it was expanding its cloud partner program, increasing investments and financial incentives, adding new technical training and certifications; and committing to the role of partners in driving adoption of its Google Cloud Platform. “Google Cloud partners are essential to our commitment to help enterprises innovate faster, scale smarter and stay secure,” company executives wrote in a March blog post announcing the expanded program. “Partners deliver significant value to our customers, and we’re committed to supporting their success.” During Sunday’s CIO Summit, Green said Google intends to use the full weight of its technological wherewithal to become the dominant player in cloud. “Google is just build for having the most technology,” Forbes quoted her as saying. “That’s what we’re good at and that’s who we’ve hired.”   Send tips and news to MSPmentorNews@Penton.com.

It basically refers to the use of online mediums to spread stories that may not be entirely true. Facebook has been working hard to combat the spread of fake news on the world’s largest social network and now the world’s most popular online search engine is taking some steps of its own to combat the menace of fake news. Google does point out that these bad results are rare on its website with just 0.25 percent being offensive or clearly misleading. Nevertheless, there’s always room to improve and it’s a good thing that Google is taking this step now more than ever. Google today announced that it’s rolling out some changes to search results with the aim to combat fake news as well as offensive content. This has been done by tweaking signals that are taken into account when ranking a web page, signals include the freshness and the frequency of a site’s appearance. This will enable Google to rank more authoritative sources highly while downranking fake content. It has now created new guidelines for the Human Search Quality Raters so that they can more effectively spot false stories. Google is even going to give users more power to spot and report sketchy content. Users can click on the feedback link to provide feedback about a particular autocomplete suggestion or Featured Snippet that they believe is sketchy. Filed in Web. Read more about Google.

Sign up / Sign in Contribute eLearning Community eLearning Community Sign Up Sign In Reflections on Adobe eLearning Conference 2017 BY Ugur Akinci April 25, 2017 2 COMMENT(S) 115 2 facebook twitter link email This was the first time I participated in Adobe eLearning Conference held in Washington D.C. and am I glad that I did so. I understand this was the second time this conference was organized. If I’m not wrong, close to 600 people attended this one, in contrast to about 200 last year (I’m told). I’m someone with one foot in online learning space and the other firmly planted in technical writing. I believe that, no matter how you slice it, creating technical “documentation” is, in essence, teaching and learning technical information. So in that sense I see a great overlap between the eLearning and TechDoc spaces. That’s why I attended this great conference as a Captivate and Presenter Express user. First off, I was very happy to meet in person some of the people that I’ve been following for a while on the Internet; truly exceptional elearning professionals like Paul Wilson, Joe Ganci, Mark Lassoff, Anita Horsley, Phil Cowcill, Nancy Reyes, Damien Bruyndonckx, Dr. Pooja Jaisingh, Dr. Alan Partridge, and others. It was my good luck to end up at the same breakfast table with most of them. BTW, talking about the breakfast – the organizers should be applauded for the super breakfast, lunch, snacks and beverages they’ve provided. Hosting (by Carahsoft) was first class and everything was free as well (including my lovely Adobe t-shirt). Thanks Adobe! My only problem with this conference was this: there was just too much to learn and attend to since there were five tracks of presentations lasting the whole day. So unfortunately I ended up attending only 20% of what was going on around me. I enjoyed some wonderful presentations about mobile elearning, principles of sound elearning design, how to use videos properly in elarning, how to design a great learning system in this “attention economy,” etc. The presentation delivered during the closing session by Tridib Roy Chowdhury (G.M. & Sr. Director of Products at Adobe) was very thought-provoking as well. In his presentation Chowdhury forwarded provocative themes like “How to Out-Google Google.” It was evident that he touched on a current concern (i.e., not enough people are using LMS for their learning) shared by most within the eLearning community but I had and still have my reservations on that score. The differences between my point of view and that of Chowdhury’s was evident from the very outset when he, in the beginning of his presentation, asked for a show-of-hands about the different venues and sources of learning that the conference participants had used recently. To me it was telling that books were not included in that list! I love things digital obviously and I’m on the Internet most of the day for all kinds of learning and information gathering. But the omission of a source as obvious as the good-old books made me wonder if we were relying on a somewhat lopsided paradigm, with too much emphasis on things digital. I believe people use different platforms and sources for different kinds of learning. Yes, I do use Google to access quick info on specific inquiries. I do not go to my local library anymore for straight-forward fact finding. But guess what, when I’d like to learn the life of a great scientist, for example, I still search for a good book written by an established writer who did a lot of research on that topic. I do not expect to learn as much and at that depth from Google for that specific mission. Another example: when I want to learn the best way to visit San Francisco or Paris, I’d check neither Google nor my local library. Instead, I’d call a friend or a relative who had been there. I’d try to learn from them all the things I should pay attention to once I’m there. They would be my first source of information for that specific case. After that I wouldn’t mind checking out Google as well. Similarly, for me eLearning has a special and very valuable place. When I want to go through a new topic in a step-by-step fashion, with all sub-topics organized from easy to difficult, while interacting with the material and testing myself along the way, I want nothing but a good eLearning module with links, pictures, videos, quizzes, badges, scores, and all that good stuff. eLearning does not need to “out-Google Google” since the two are designed to accomplish different tasks and serve different benefits. I’m still meditating on this issue but so far my conclusions have not changed. I’d like to thank Chowdhury all the same for his seminal presentation even though I do not agree with him totally on all of his points. I don’t know where the 3rd conference will be held next year but I’ll try to be there. I guess it should not be that hard to find the date and location on the Google P.S. If you’d like to read a great book on the life of Enrico Fermi, I heartily recommend “The Pope of Physics: Enrico Fermi and the Birth of the Atomic Age” by Bettina Hoerlin and Gino Claudio Segre. When you finish it you will be automatically out-Googling the Google since you can’t read this stuff on Google. adobe eLearning conferencedocumentationeLearninggooglewriting 2 Responses Paul Wilson says: April 25, 2017 at 5:17 pm Ugur, what a great contribution and very thought provoking article for the community.

This is Sy. Today is World Malaria Day. The global health community and a coalition of public-private initiatives has successfully begun taming the scourge,with a 21% decrease in its global incidence and 29% drop in mortality rate between 2010 and 2015; still, there were 212 million malaria cases worldwide and nearly 430,000 deaths from the disease in 2015, according to the latest World Health Organization (WHO) figures. One key tactic for fighting infectious diseases like malaria is to pinpoint exactly where they're spreading in order to stop them in their tracks. This way, preventive measures like mosquito control and the deployment of treatment resources can be better targeted. And Google, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) have banded together with academic and public health partners with this very goal in mind. The organizations are taking part in a Malaria Elimination Initiative effort called project DiSARM which will be piloted in Swaziland and Zimbabwe and uses the Google Earth Engine to map malaria. The University of California, San Francisco's epidemiology and biostatistics professor Hugh Sturrock—who leads DiSARM—explained exactly why Google's tech can help fight the disease. "Every time someone is diagnosed with malaria in Swaziland and Zimbabwe, a team goes to the village where the infection occurred and collects a GPS point with the precise infection location," he said in an interview posted on Google's blog. "Just looking at these points won’t allow you to accurately determine the risk of malaria, though. You also need satellite imagery of conditions like rainfall, temperature, slope and elevation, which affect mosquito breeding and parasite development." The Google Earth Engine makes this seemingly ancillary (yet critical) data far easier to collect, according to Sturrock. " In the past we had to obtain those images from a range of sources: NASA, USGS and different universities around the world. But with Google Earth Engine, it’s all in one place and can be processed using Google computers. We combine satellite imagery data from Google Earth Engine with the locations of malaria cases collected by a country’s national malaria control program, and create models that let us generate maps identifying areas at greatest risk." Read on for the day's news. Sy Mukherjee @the_sy_guy sayak.mukherjee@fortune.com Correction: April 25, 5:35 p.m.: The original version of this article misstated the mortality rate from malaria. It has been corrected. DIGITAL HEALTH American Well seeks to simplify enrollment process for doctors. Telehealth giant American Well announced a number of new offerings and features during the American Telemedicine Association in Orlando on Monday, including one aimed at taking some of the pain out of the behind-the-scene signup process for doctors. The AW10 service will attempt to make it easier for physicians to enroll and begin offering telemedicine visits, and also simplify critical steps like insurance verification and shifting between automated and manual prescription services. American Well CEO Dr. Roy Schoenberg elaborated on the services in an interview with MobiHealthNews. (MobiHealthNews) INDICATIONS Express Scripts shares fall sharply after losing its biggest client. The ongoing battle between insurance providers, drug companies, and pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs) took a dramatic turn as insurance giant Anthem said it would ditch PBM Express Scripts going forward. That's pretty unfortunate for Express Scripts since Anthem is its biggest customer (its shares are down about 11% since the news emerged). Anthem has claimed that the benefits manager isn't passing on savings to the insurer, in effect overcharging it by billions. Scripts disputes that notion but has been preparing for Anthem's exodus nonetheless. (Fortune) Crazy biotech valuations drive Novartis to look for earlier stage candidates. The premiums that pharma companies pay for biotechs with mid-to-late stage experimental drugs has risen to a point that has some analysts crying "bubble." But it's not just the peanut gallery raising the alarm—drug makers are also shifting their strategies, as evidenced by Novartis chief Joe Jimenez's statements this morning during an earnings conference call with reporters. “The price of some of these assets has increased to the point that we don’t feel like we can create value for Novartis shareholders,’’ he said. Instead, Novartis will be focusing on snatching up experimental treatments that aren't quite as advanced (and costly). (Bloomberg) Sanofi files antitrust suit against Mylan over EpiPen. French drug giant Sanofi is accusing EpiPen maker Mylan of tactics meant to squelch competition from a rival epinephrine device. At the heart of Sanofi's complaint, lodged in a lawsuit filed in New Jersey on Monday? Mylan predicated discounts to pharmacy benefits managers and government health payers like Medicaid on the condition that they would not cover EpiPen alternatives such as Auvi-Q. To note: this may not exactly be the most uncommon strategy in the biopharma world. More on that later. (CNBC) THE BIG PICTURE Nixing the Obamacare subsidies that are under the gun would actually cost the government even more. Health care policy is all about tradeoffs. You get rid of a regulation here, you get unanticipated social costs there. Turns out, getting rid of one set of subsidies meant to lower poorer Americans' out-of-pocket health costs can actually raise premiums significantly—and consequently cost the government way more money to help subsidize the premium increases, to the tune of 23% more spending relative to the cost savings. (USA Today) REQUIRED READING Can You Innovate Your Way to Better Beef, Chicken, or Fish? by Beth Kowitt  Now We Know What Yahoo Made on Its Early Snapchat Bet, by Lucinda Shen This Dairy Company Says Its Business Model Is the Future of Corporate America, by Beth Kowitt Hulu and the Fight for Real-Time TV, by Michal Lev-Ram Produced by Sy Mukherjee @the_sy_guy sayak.mukherjee@fortune.com Find past coverage.
