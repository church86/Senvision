Google is hoping to establish itself as a significant player in the mobile niche, while Samsung must look to recover from the disastrous exploding Galaxy Note 7. While the appearance of the tenth anniversary iPhone 8 will also pose challenges for both developers. Image Credit: Ivo Maric / Concept Creator / YouTube video (screenshot) Galaxy Note 8: Big screen And the latest reports on the Galaxy Note 8 suggest that the phablet will feature a bigger screen than this year’s Galaxy S8. Whispers from close to the Samsung supply chain in East Asia indicate that the consumer electronics giant is ready to fit the next generation mobile with a 6.4-inch infinity display. After the Galaxy S8 included a wraparound display, and with rumors that Apple will include such a screen in the iPhone 8, it is clear that the industry is heading generally in this direction. And it now also seems likely that the front panel of the Galaxy Note 8 will be dominated by significant screen real estate, while the handset may even be more compact than previous releases. As confirmation of this notion, a video posted by Twitter user @mmddj_china seems to reveal the glass-fronted panel from the upcoming Galaxy Note 8. This device is almost completely free of bezels, with extremely narrow bordering above and below the opening for the display. This is an interesting development, as @mmddj_china is a prominent leaker who has been correct in the past on various tech issues. The glass panel included in the video is also an interesting indication of the direction that Samsung may take. And it will be interesting to see how this stacks up against the design of the Apple iPhone 8. Dual-lens camera Recent reports have also suggested that the Galaxy Note 8 will feature a dual-lens rear camera, with the fingerprint scanner in the device being moved and integrated into the display. This will be made possible by the screen-dominated design, while it is also anticipated that both Samsung and Apple will eliminate Home buttons from their devices before the end of the calendar year. Smartphone insider Ming Chi-Kuo has already indicated his belief that the 3x optical zoom camera featuring six element lenses will be the most important new feature in the next-generation Samsung handset, making the photographic capabilities of the Samsung snapper much better than those of the existing iPhone 7 Plus. There have also been suggestions that Samsung will update the user interface included in the Galaxy Note 8 in order to make it more intuitive and user-friendly. Image Credit: Concept Creator / YouTube video (screenshot) Google Pixel 2 details emerge Meanwhile, more details have emerged regarding the second-generation Google smartphone. The Google Pixel 2 can be considered more of a mid-range device, with the screen of the handset significantly smaller than the Galaxy Note range, or even the iPhone 7 Plus. Google evidently believes that the premium smartphone niche is hugely crowded, and thus is aiming for an entirely different market. Geekbench has posted solid details on the Google Pixel 2 cover, with the general consensus of opinion being that the mega-corporation is currently working on three handsets to comprise this range. It is thought that the device tested by Geekbench will be the largest in the series. Specs from the testing process indicate that the Google Pixel 2 will utilize a CPU described as a “Qualcomm @ 1.90 GHz, 1 processor 8 cores”. This points to the Snapdragon 835 that was used previously in the United States model of the Samsung Galaxy S8. 4GB of RAM will also power the device, while the handset in question was running the O generation of Android, which is due for release later this year, widely tipped to be branded as Android Oreo. The device tested by Geekbench also scored 1,804 in single-core testing and 6,248 in multi-core. Google has yet to confirm the existence of the Pixel 2, but reports have indicated that the new smartphone has three internal codenames at the corporation; namely, Muskie, Walleye and Taimen; one of which refers to the expected Pixel XL 2. There is little concrete information on precisely how these models will differ, and only one version of the Google Pixel 2 turned up on Geekbench. But the general consensus is that there will be variance in size and memory in particular. Wraparound display There is some debate over whether or not the Google Pixel 2 will include a wraparound display. This is obviously becoming a popular trend in the industry, but with the Pixel 2 essentially intended to be an affordable device, it is questionable whether Google will be able to include such a display while keeping the price down. And the price tag of the Google Pixel 2 is certainly expected to be affordable, with a possible $650 launch price being linked with the smartphone in the United States. Considering that the iPhone 8 may retail at a price tag in excess of $1,000, this means that many consumers on a budget may be tempted by the Google handset. Camera improvements However, despite the affordable price tag of the Google Pixel 2, it is still anticipated that Google will make significant improvements to this handset. In particular, camera upgrades are expected, with some reports suggesting that the snapper included in this smartphone will be superior to the existing iPhone 7 camera. Google Assistant Meanwhile, Google has also been working on improving its assistant software with the intention of rivalling the existing Siri and Bixby. In future editions, Google Assistant will enable users to analyse the surrounding world with the assistance of the camera included in Google devices. Google refers to this technology as Google Lens, and there are obvious similarities between this new innovation and the Google Glass hardware that proved to be somewhat unsuccessful for the corporation. Thus, for example, Google Lens users can see restaurant ratings by pointing their phones at a storefront, along with many other titbits of information. With this new technology likely to be included in the Google Pixel 2, this promises to be an innovative and intriguing smartphone release.

The Google Play Store was coming, and with it millions of Android applications that would resolve the “app gap” keeping Chrome OS from being a serious contender for many. Microsoft Office, social media applications, and even some popular games would help Chromebooks grow beyond their reputation as simple machines that are just for browsing the web. It hasn’t gone so well. According to the Google site that tracks which Chromebooks are Play Store eligible, only a handful are on board. And even when the flagship Samsung Chromebook Pro launches the Play Store’s inclusion will still technically be in beta. There was no splashy demo at I/O this year, but there was one developer event that unrolled a lightly scratched out roadmap of where things are going. The future’s coming, just not quite as quickly as we thought. The Latest from Google I/O A Google I/O session led by Shahid Hussain, a product manager on Chrome OS, shed some light on why this effort is slogging along. For example, Google is grappling with performance and proper implementation of its own apps from smartphones to Chromebooks. The presentation featured a view of Google Maps, which awkwardly showed empty bars on either side of the app when it was launched on a Chromebook. Not surprisingly, turning applications that were originally built for devices that fit in pockets into software for more traditional computers is a serious challenge. One remedy is a new Chrome emulator beta for developers to test how their app looks and performs on a Chromebook. It’s one of many pieces of technical work that Google is doing to improve the experience. Additionally, apps built for Android Nougat and the forthcoming Android O will be further optimized for Chromebooks, with the Google team pushing to ensure features like using apps in split-screen mode and easy window resizing come to be. If there’s one upside to this nearly year-long beta test, is that it means everything will hopefully be sorted out correctly. Google knows this process needs to be smoothed out, it’s just unfortunate that a $550 laptop will launch with what feels like an unfinished feature. Where Chromebook Use Stands Today In principle I love the concept of a Chromebook. My productivity life revolves Google apps, and as an Android user I enjoy the integration that comes with all my tabs syncing across Chrome and the “buy once, use anywhere” ethos of the Play Store. The other day my Windows 10 PC reported that 98 percent of my battery life usage was, you guessed it, from Chrome. Cutting out the middleman OS makes a lot of sense. The Play Store is a great idea, it just hasn’t quite resolved all of the pain points for going all-in with Chrome OS. However, much of the work world still runs in Office, so using Microsoft’s app suite is essential. Not all Microsoft apps have been fully vetted for Chrome - for example, I can download Outlook and OneDrive to my Asus Chromebook Flip but not Word, Excel, or PowerPoint. Yes, there are the Office Online versions, but the rapid development pace of the Android applications make these the ideal suitors for my productivity needs. A device like the Chromebook Pro tempts me as a potential daily driver. For others who may have lighter computing needs, a Chromebook is the right choice. I want to get there, but Android apps, even with some excellent choices like Adobe’s suite, still haven’t quite won me over. A Brighter Road Ahead? Google thrives on optimism, so of course there’s a plan for how to resolve the future of the integration of Android apps with Chromebooks. As The Verge discovered, the Samsung Chromebook Pro will kick off what Google plans to be a new phase, where some Android features may one day come to Chrome OS before they hit Android. That would be a great coup, because Chromebooks are on a six-week update cycle. Android, by contrast, has an annual dessert-themed upgrade with monthly security releases. While this won’t happen with Android O, it’s easy to see why specific APIs or features that make sense on a Chromebook shouldn’t have to wait to come to phones first. Such a new scheme would certainly be welcome. Scaling things up from mobile to a larger form factor isn’t easy - even the iPad Pro has plenty of growing pains. But getting this right is critical if Google is going to take Chrome OS deeper into the enterprise and consumer markets as a viable option to the current platform kings.

Let's hope that Google fares better than MS did because MS never even came close to figuring out how to make it work properly.

Google Contacts 2.0 includes a cleaner UI and changes to contact management [APK Download] Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/11 1:53pm PDTMay 11, 2017 72 Plus 1 on G+ 155 Share on Facebook 123 Share on Twitter Total Shares350 Applications Downloads Google News The Google Contacts application really hasn't changed much over the years - after all, it just has to store contacts. Last year the app was updated with a hamburger menu and the ability to merge duplicates. Now Google has released version 2.0 of the Contacts app, with more design improvements and changes to how contacts are sorted. New design Contacts 2.0 has several minor interface tweaks all over the place, which address a few gripes I (and likely some of you) have had with the application. The actual list of contacts looks the same, but the slide-out menu now features an account switcher.    Left: Contacts 1.6; Center, Right: Contacts 2.0 Previously, the app would show all contacts from all your synced Google accounts together. Now you can easily keep contacts separate, or still combine all of them if you want. Another noticeable change is on the contacts themselves - the user icon has been reduced to a small circle instead of covering the top half of the screen.   Left: Contacts 1.6; Right: Contacts 2.0 There are a few other changes on the contact pages. The menu has removed the option to link a contact, but it has a new 'Move' item that moves contacts to another Google account. The edit button has also been moved to a floating action button. Other changes Moving on to the app settings, you can now choose which accounts to use when exporting contacts. Contacts 2.0 also supports Android O's notification channels, with a single channel called 'Notifications' (really helpful name, I know).   A quick look at the APK code reveals that this channel is used for export status notifications. I'm not really sure what the point of implementing Notification Channel support is if your app only has one kind of notification, but props to the Contacts team for getting a head start on Android O support. Finally, there is a new splash screen when you open Contacts for the first time: It basically just tells you that the app will automatically back up your contacts, which might not have been immediately obvious to people using Android for the first time. APK Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way. Rather than wait for Google to push this download to your devices, which can take days, download and install it just like any other APK.

Grey Corbin, please. You have to rip Google for this. It's inexcusable. Someone needs to put pressure on the company for their ridiculous UI beliefs. Wasted space galore, circular images for the sake of circular images. This is the peak of their insanity. We used to rip Google for their UI issues all the time. Now they are trying, but that doesn't mean we no longer criticize them. Look at this! I still remember the Nexus 4 announcement, when they introduced this version of Contacts. They praised the big, beautiful, high-res images, and the fact that the new camera could capture them. Now it's five years later and we've gone in the complete opposite direction? Please, someone at AP step up to the plate. Filipe Santos Yup, the overall changes are very good but that wasting space is so bad.... They try at least like Corbin said morteum Why are these tiny contact pictures becoming a thing? Filipe Santos People are starting to use glasses 😂😂 Jimk4003 I think it's because a lot of contact photos are low Res images synced of social media that look awful when blown up to fill half a screen. A smaller photo might not be as dramatic, but at least it isn't a pixelated mess. At least, I assume that's the thinking behind it. Corbin Davenport Yeah, blurry contact photos were a constant problem with the old design. Though, a tiny icon that takes up almost as much space isn't much better. Mochen Liu But you can change a high res photo yourself if you cam't stand it... I have high res photos for most of my contacts. Android Developer How ? You took a picture yourself, or used an app like "SyncMe" (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.syncme.syncmeapp&hl=en) or "ContactSync" (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lb.contacts_sync&hl=en) ? Grey Blurry contact photos are only a problem if you don't care about your contact photos. And if you don't care about them, then you aren't interested in fixes. Savage Alien I remember some of this being Google's fault. A while back, before the whole Material Design era, There was inconsistent syncing between web and mobile and somehow resulted in low res version of the images being synced even when you used high res images since the servers would keep low res copies for thumb nails and things. tismondo Has this problem been fixed? It definitely happened to me - I stopped bothering managing my contact photos because I got tired of blurry versions syncing across every time I replace my phone or flash a ROM. Sashank Narayan Yes, it has since been fixed. I haven't had the issue in a few years now. Elizabethmgamble Google is paying 97$ per hour!

EDIT: OH MY GOD, YOU ACTUALLY CAN! catalysto Actually, you can do exactly that. Maxr1998 Yeah, just found out myself. Everything ok then 😜 Willie Chalmers III At least Google followed their material design guidelines in the original layout. The newer layout is a true waste of space. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ +1 for cute doggie pic. http://livewallpaper.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/cute-dog-wallpaper12.jpg JacobTheDev I honestly prefer the old one, never had an issue with "wasted space." It's not really wasted, it's a design decision, and I think it's effective in that it treats the contact as a person and not just a bunch of random data; it helped to identify who's contact information you where looking at. I hope this doesn't affect how phone calls come in... Chris Wachtman I really prefer the old design on the left. I set decent photos for my frequent contacts, and I enjoy seeing them prominently displayed. Anyone else use the Contact homescreen widget? Alfredo Hernández Exactly, it would suck big time if they gave the Phone app the same treatment. incognito27 I wouldn't call the left one a waste of space. It actually looks nice. There is nothing wrong with it. The right one though. Ooohooo. The circular icon seems pointless. Winston This is why I like Samsung's Contacts app. It displays a tiny circle like the version 2.0 one if the image is low res, but displays a half-height full-res image like the earlier build if it has an HD one. Which you can swipe down to view in its entirety. Fruity101079 Seriously, this is so stupid. Why selling big screen phones if it's to have ridiculous tiny pictures!!?? If people have blurry pictures, that's their problems. A lot of us took time to use "high res" pictures for all our contacts. And we have to deal with people who doesn't care.... >:( F4LL0U7 I was hoping the Contacts app would bring in the recently-removed feature from Google+ that allows you to keep your contacts up to date, using your contacts' linked Google accounts and downloading that info into your own Contacts app. Since they removed that feature from G+, when I got a new phone I had to download an old version of G+, sync contacts, and then update G+. Another gripe I have about Contacts: every time I reset my phone, the contacts that I previously merged (before resetting) become unmerged and I have to do it all over again. Michael Tran I think it just pulls automatically now. I added a new contact and entered in their gmail and it pulled the photo automatically. The option is gone from G+ but it still did it anyway. F4LL0U7 Pulling the photo always worked, but linking with G+ pulled in all other info, like address, phone, etc. as well. Michael Tran Ah okay. I understand now. cadtek91 This also took away the ability for the phone to download your own photo for the User account photo in the quicksettings drawer. Savage Alien I've never liked having a blank user picture, and each time I wiped my phone I'd be frustrated having to remember how to get mine to show up. Always surprised this was a feature "buried" in Google+.... and now it's gone? No other way to have your google photo to show up? F4LL0U7 Can you believe that?! The only other way is to manually select a photo yourself. There doesn't seem to be any other way to pull in your Google profile pic, other than installing an old version of G+. Disqusman Yup...only realised that yesterday when I reset my Nexus 6P. Sux. I manually set a photo...but I may download an older version of G+ to get all the contacts to sync. cadtek91 Not that I know of. You could manually add the same photo but eh. F4LL0U7 I hate that! That's the main reason why I grabbed an old version of G+, so I could have my profile pic show up. Phil Worst decision ever. I see I'm not the only one who keeps an old Version of G+ around for that exactly. Downloads at APK Mirror must have gone up quite a lot :D F4LL0U7 I should probably do that too. Now that I think of it, I have no idea which version I download. Which version is it? Tiuri Elvander If you add a picture to your Allo profile, this picture shows up in the quick settings drawer. cadtek91 I have an Allo picture, but still no user picture. YouNex Merging contacts has always been a mess, it never syncs properly. Just copy any additional details and remove the other doublons, keep only 1 per each contact. It's manual but more fail-proof Ben Godfrey This used to bug me too. I think if you merge contacts via the new web interface (the pretty material design one, not the old Gmail-looking one), it will sync the changes across everything. It's been a while since I've had to merge duplicates, though -- somebody let me know if this is incorrect. F4LL0U7 Cool thanks, I'll try that! Carson Saldanha Finally none of those low-res, blown up contact pictures. Savage Alien Haven't had that issue in years. Carson Saldanha It's mainly with those people who use low-res pics for their Google account. Savage Alien I'd take fuzzy photo over this new design. I have maybe one low res contact photo and I picked it myself for nostalgia reasons. Cameras on phones are only getting better, too, so this isn't a great excuse to use going forward... (and even much older phone would likely take passable photos) Luzandro Haven't seen this for a long time, but even if this is a real problem for some people, there are better ways to solve it. For example I've seen a dialer/contacts app (don't recall the name) where some sort of dots effect was applied to low res images, which made them look quite nice actually roberto.elena Can the contact names still be edited using multiple fields like name prefix, first name, middle name, etc. or is it all one field now like in the new web version? Tiuri Elvander Customising which groups show up doesn't work for me. People from other groups are still shown in the list. Martins Nkem Looks like the Samsung contact app.. Good job Google Kurt Gomez Can't link contacts across accounts anymore Mochen Liu I love the yuge portrait design... why google? why?... Savage Alien Terrible design. Haven't updated my Phone Dialer app either because they made the same change to it months ago. Android Developer It's even worse during call. What's the point of having HQ image for contacts, if I can't see them nicely during call... I tried to request for this here: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/36705104 But for some reason they didn't agree. Bewear It's... ugly. Tim Harman Can you pick which photo to use from the multiples available in a merged account? It annoys me no end I can't pick the really lovely photo of my wife, instead of just the lovely one Google picked. It used to be a feature, then it went away somewhere. Trevor Hawk They also removed the ability to customize which contacts to display in settings Corbin Davenport Are you sure? It's still there for me. Trevor Hawk Yep. It's gone for me. https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6dKMVDga-L9MkwxZGJDUVJBLW8 Alfredo Hernández Damn, that's weird. I definitely still have it on mine. Tiuri Elvander In your first screenshot there an option "contact to display". Surely that's what you want??? Trevor Hawk Thats a screen shot of the older version Tiuri Elvander Ah, my bad. That's very weird. 2 Men-E I much prefer the large contact picture... whispy_snippet Same. Disqusman Agree 100% derp_cookies We also preferred an integrated, all-in-one chat application too... YouNex Whiter =/= cleaner, this isn't some sort of effing clothes King_Android This might the first time ever I will wait for an update to be forced upon me with a Google app. 😱 jcopernicus I can honestly say the contact portraits are great use of space. Not some soul less list of information. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a4a682a8e0c801948117beab20317cc0df2b2d6bac2c85d9ac535412608edc9f.png Ygor Cortes The new contact page with the ridiculously small picture looks disgusting. The old one was much better. Oh Google... Ygor Cortes I'm glad that I don't use Google Contacts anymore for a while now! Timothy Bracken It looks like your blocked numbers are now part of the contacts app. Does this mean that blocked numbers are now backed up and restorable? I can't test this since I don't have a 2nd device. Grey Does Contacts have a Personal Profile yet that is stored on the web? How does Google not have that in 2017? Corbin Davenport It does if you go to settings and tap 'Your info.' Grey That's a local profile. It's not available on the web. In the Gmail app, when I ask it to add my email to contacts, it can't see my "Your Info", and it instead looks for a contact entry. It doesn't exist. Android is 8 years old and does not have this option. Tiuri Elvander Your Google+ profile??? Grey Which is not a part of Contacts. Also, maybe you don't want to use Google+ but would like to have a "Self" profile in your contacts (without making yourself your own contact entry). Winston Being a Google app, I'm surprised it's not already on version 89.7 JG I have a cross-platform upgrade that involves Contacts I'd love to see Google make... Google made a comment about their commitment to helping improve online security [probably in an article talking about their use of HTTPS helping to encrypt the majority of web traffic]. I'd like to see them step this commitment up. They're working on a key server that's supposedly more focused on linking the key to a particular profile (to ensure the key belongs to the person claiming its theirs). I'd like to see Google launch the service. Create a new app that allows us to either create a new key or upload an existing key. Update Contacts to link to the key server database and automatically pair contacts with their corresponding public keys (if a match exists). Update Android Messages, Hangouts, Allo, GMail, et al to automatically encrypt any outgoing messages to contacts with public keys. Then even non-technical people can begin using encrypted messages. All it'd take is to download an app, tap a button or two and bam. Disqusman My God! Who made that decision to go with the tiny circular image?! The large contact picture is so much more beautiful. I really dislike how they changed the UI in the dialer to the small contact picture as well :/ ast00 The new contact page with the tiny picture and lots of wasted space is a step back. Shailesh Kumar Is it only exclusive to pixel devices? How can I have this on my moto x style? Daan Smit Guys, I am just not able to display contacts from a number of Google contact groups and my outlook contacts. I can only see my outlook contacts if I either opt for viewing all candidates or only outlook contacts. This also happens on the standard OnePlus3t contacts app. It used to work on Marshmallow though. Is this an Android issue? Exalm It seems they're getting rid of cards and shadows everywhere in favor of simple lists.Flat notifications and quick settings (Nougat), flat dialing screen, flat app drawer in Pixel Launcher, flat Play Store My Apps screen, and now flat contact page. What next? :) Cakefish I'm planning to replace my Galaxy S7 with the Pixel 2 this year because I usually prefer Google's UI, but in this case I actually prefer Samsung's contact app UI: https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/55ecc6c4c968731fab76e21b370c08aeaf4c2fce79c88314a96bbbf54656503b.png Alex Rusinov How do you link / merge contacts now? Selecting multiple contacts doesn't provide an option to merge only to share. Also I can't find "link" feature anywhere, only "unlink" Zachary Dunn Cleaner? You mean they got rid of the colorful highlights and made it into another white/gray bland app. They could have scaled down the image a bit to take less space. But a full hero image looks much better than a huge gray space with a tiny avatar iamakii I'm liking this cleaner look and interface Nick Felker Regarding notification channels, they will be required in Android O for all apps before a notification can be presented. So expect to see other apps follow suit. Just Is the rollout halted? I'm still not seeing 2.0. Not that if I crave to have it whith this new tiny avatar circle.

The simple one-to-one video calling app that is a direct alternative to Apple’s FaceTime is currently available for Android and iOs users. “Duo takes the complexity out of video calling so that you can be together in the moment wherever you are,” Google said in its blogsite. When a user signs up, the app checks user’s phone number then sends a confirmation text. The said app does not require a user to sign up a Google account. Duo seamlessly switches between mobile data and Wi-Fi without dropping the call. It also comes with a feature called Knock Knock which lets the user to see live video of the caller before answering the call. In addition, the Duo is built with an emphasis on privacy and security, and all calls are end-to-end encrypted. “Users are reluctant to video call because they don’t know if the other person is on the right network, the right device or it’s a good time to call. We’ve tried to remove all that friction and make it feel like an invitation, not an interruption when someone calls you,” Amity Fulay, Google’s group manager for communications said in a theguardian.comreport. Google said that their latest application will be live worldwide in the next few days.

Google is now offering four free months of Google Play Music for new subscribers Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/26 2:17pm PDTMay 26, 2017 82 Plus 1 on G+ 614 Share on Facebook 102 Share on Twitter Total Shares798 Google News Right now it looks like Google is running a special offer for Google Play Music. New subscribers that sign up here can get four free months of service instead of the usual three. No telling how long this offer might last, so if you have been considering subscribing, now might be the time to do it. It could save you an extra $10. Again, this particular offer is only for new subscribers. I've been a fan of Play Music for a long time, though the device removal limit does get in the way when you switch between devices and ROMs as often as I do. Being able to mix your own library with those of a service also comes in handy. That way I can continue to support artists I am passionate about, without eschewing the larger selection of a subscription offering for the purposes of content discovery, all while being able to fill the gaps in that library. There are a lot of different music services out there, but if you're interested combining your curated library with music available via a subscription, then your options are limited. Spotify does allow you to play back locally stored files, which is convenient, but it isn't quite the same. Amazon also allows you to upload your music for playback via Amazon Music, and with Amazon Prime membership, you get a small library of streaming music to go along with that. For $10 a month ($8 for Prime members) you can access their full library as well. But, Google Play Music has a great interface and plugs nicely into all the other Google services we love. Maybe with this new offer, it's time you gave Google Play Music a chance? After all, even if it doesn't end up working out, you still got four free months of music out of the deal.

Carson Saldanha Wait, wdym 3 different countries? Did you share it with others or something? Ailín Ó’S I live in Ireland, so that's my main account. I have a secondary account based in England as part of a mail forwarder service I use, and my bf is Greek so I had him check the code on his account :) Carson Saldanha Oh wow! Carson Saldanha Hey, since I know it worked for you, are you able to use YouTube Red along with this Play Music free trial? Because my YT Red doesn't seem to be enabled for me. Ailín Ó’S No, unfortunately not as I live in the EU and YouTube Red is only available in USA. Carson Saldanha Weird, I'm in the US though. Ailín Ó’S Ooh that is odd. Sign out of the app then sign back in maybe? Carson Saldanha No luck :( I'm in contact with Google support atm Hopefully they can sort this out Mike Worth it alone for Youtube Red MisterAlex Sweet, I wasn't sure if that was included. Thanks. Should mention that in the main blog post. Ben Still no student membership >:( Ailín Ó’S Spotify is a great alternative @€$£5/month. Ben I know that's what I use just because it's half the price. Ailín Ó’S In Ireland Vodafone have a partnership with Spotify whereby it costs €5 standard instead of €10 regardless of if you're a student or not, they even bundle it with some of their plans. Vodafone do the same in some other countries they operate in (not all). Maybe see if any network in your country has a partnership like that? Worth a shot! Ben Oh yeah I'm on EE in the UK and I've got Apple Music for free for 6 months but like iTunes is a massive stinking turd. Ailín Ó’S I'd rather go back to the days of getting music via Bluetooth from friends than use crApple Music 😂😂 Rahul Krishna In india, we have play music for 1.4 usd/month Umang Ladia I'm only seeing 2 months offer in India.?? Rahul Krishna Well I subscribed to it when it launched here (about 2 months ago), so I can't confirm that. But at this price, there is nothing to be disappointed about. aRvInD I wish Spotify launches soon here. I can't keep using that patched version here...!! Rahul Krishna Me too xyz As it should be, you can't charge European or American prices in India. Rahul Krishna Yes true. There are lots​ of people here with a very cheap Android phone. They cannot pay much money. Julian Coronado That's actually what's keeping me away from Play Music. I've used my free months and I loved the Youtube Red too. But as a student, Spotify for $5 / month is too great to pass up on. Emiliejmosley Google is paying 97$ per hour! Work for few hours & have longer with friends and family! !sm141c: On tuesday I got a great new Land Rover Range Rover from having earned $8752 this last four weeks.. Its the most-financialy rewarding I've had..

Cakefish Spotify ftw ToniCipriani ✓pǝᴉɟᴉɹǝʌ I don't think this is a new offer, got this a while back. In fact my 4 months is expiring next week. Prefer Spotify over it. Song selection a tad bit weaker, and for foreign songs it tries to translate the song names to English and makes it hard to look up. folkrav I like it, it's way cheaper than Spotify for me - my mother, my sister, my wife and myself each pay 30$ a year and we're set - but Jesus do I hate the clients. I don't like the website's interface, I hate the Android app. But yeah, I'll deal with it cause it's cheap, I guess. Carson Saldanha Got it! Yay! Jim I wish I could somehow get it on my Amazon Echo hahaha. I guess if I had paid for a Google Home it would be worth trying out. Forget vega #getEVGA Why google play music isn't available in my country ? Ailín Ó’S Try Apple Music? They seem to be just about everywhere. Iamsecond And this is why Apple continue to dominate, because Apple are truly interested in being an international company whereas Google is just playing at it. Such a shame xyz Because Google sucks. Bartek Juszczak My GPM radio's are so good these days I love that Google is so into AI. Whether It's just "I'm being lucky" or radio from a specific song, band or album they very rarely disappoint me these days. I just make sure to thumbs up if it plays a song I particularly love. I am a student and could go cheaper with spotify but the AI generated playlists have me locked in. If it's £5 cheaper but I'm not gonna enjoy it nearly as much then it's not really a good deal. AndTheWorldMayNeverKnow I used the 3 or 4 months free trial during the holidays then bought the family plan for $14.99 a month. 4 people in my family us it and it works great, the app could use some tweaks but it's really good overall. paev If you listen to main stream music it doesn't really matter what service to use. However, if you like something unusual, weird or other languages then Google is a way to go. I found bands on Google music that Spotify displayed as not found. Google also have new synth bands that Spotify doesn't. I'm for Google too. Daniel I discovered that GPM is kinda like a music label. I once went to a section of Google play explaining how indie artists can use GPM like a music label as long as they own all their rights. Ryne Hager Ultraista (among others) keeps me using Google Play Music as well as Spotify. Carson Saldanha Does anyone else who activated the Play Music trial have YouTube Red working as well? My YT Red doesn't seem to be enabled while my Play Music is. Michael Carr I spotted a similar offer a couple of months ago, and I took it after a day or two's thought. Just last week, I moved directly into a family plan. PewPewYoureDead It's hard to recommend Google Play Music until they revamp the UI. Margaritas Ante Porcos Google Music is the only choice in some markets, like Russia, where no Spotify or Pandora are available. There are too many shortcomings in Google Music and Google never shows interest in making services better than below average. I really wonder why Google refuses to become the best at anything. Real magic here. Pixel syndrome all the way. Yet Google Music is on my phone and I use it because there's no choice whatsoever. Rob You answered your own question. If there's no alternative, then they don't have any incentive to improve the service. SupahNin10doh Stupid Dorito logo... Raymond Berger Huh, I just subscribed to the trial but you youtube red hasn't kicked in yet. Any idea how long it takes? Iamsecond If you live in the UK, about 2 years so far h20ray Google Play Music is currently available in select territories and for select account types. Umang Ladia I'm only seeing 2 months offer in India, anybody can confirm? Mohammad Ovais Yeah, same for me. Maybe it's region limited. Isolde I think you need to open the link in a browser, if you open it in the app it's just the normal 2 months. bligui Confirmed need to open it from link and it works Manoj | Blogging Triggers Is Google Music really worth to it? We have better alternatives Sathiya Moorthy Karan I came across a great post, it seems to be so cool http://developeit.net/android-news-image-scanner-finder/ Zachariah Mann It only shows up as 2 free months for me. I live in Michigan. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a19b7e9dddb67bf897c751aedf63c01917048214140db901fd783b2182d8d5c0.png Jefferson Rodrigues https://play.google.com/music/listen?coupon=120DFREE&coupontype=vanity#/sulp Zachariah Mann That link still brought me to the same page on the Play Music App which offers 2 months free. Does it matter if I'm opening it on a computer or web page? Jefferson Rodrigues I don't know. Mikael Jakobsson Should mabye joine premium at Google Music if that coste like $2 max a month dont understand why they should take as mutch as someone some has app or Win32 software to PC so music controllers one they keyboards works. Tab out frome a game for pause music when the round is over is just bad. Arif Gürü And stil isnt available on Turkey xyz "No telling how long this offer might last, so if you have been considering subscribing, now might be the time to do it." No thanks, I'll just use YouTube. Only thing YT needs is an option to play audio only so I can save a wee bit more data when I don't need video. Cai Copley Nope. If it wasn't for the fact work pays for Spotify Premium and the fact Spotify has Crossfade to emulate a DJ system, maybe I'd give it a whirl. bligui Not working any more to bad Follow Android Police 1.49M 472k 145k 119k Latest Deals 9 [Deal Alert] Chromecast Ultra is $59.99 ($10 off) at Google Store, Best Buy, B&H and others 2017/06/04 12:16pm PDTJun 4, 2017 13 [Deal Alert] Google Home is $109 ($20 off) at Best Buy, Google Store, B&H, and others 2017/06/04 10:07am PDTJun 4, 2017 12 [Deal Alert] Kick off the weekend with 24 temporarily free and 52 on-sale apps 2017/06/03 6:50pm PDTJun 3, 2017 18 [Deal Alert] Get a Nextbit Robin for $129.99 on eBay 2017/06/03 9:39am PDTJun 3, 2017 33 [Deal Alert] A Stork's Journey is currently free on Google Play Movies & TV 2017/06/01 10:50pm PDTJun 1, 2017 Latest Poll How many photos are on your Google Photos account?

[Update: Now $75 Off] Deal Alert: Pixel 32GB (international version) is $50 off on eBay Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/05/26 2:20pm PDTMay 26, 2017 2 Plus 1 on G+ 53 Share on Facebook 57 Share on Twitter Total Shares112 Deals News Pixel Update 1: 2017/05/26 2:32pm PDT It looks like the price has dropped another $25, making this a $75 savings in total. For a device that hasn't seen much in the way of price drops or It's no secret that Google has had some serious supply issues with its flagship Pixel phone. That goes for pretty much any combination of size, color, or storage. Rumors even began to surface alleging that Google had stopped production of the devices altogether. That wasn't the case, but nonetheless, you will still struggle to actually find the Pixel if you wish to buy it. A 32GB Pixel (international version) on eBay for $50 off the list price could be the answer to that problem. This is the entry level 5" Pixel, with 32GB of storage in the color Very Silver - and it's available for $599. That's $50 less than the $649 Google is still charging for it. Beware though, this is the international version of the device. So if you live in the US you'll have to check the bands to see if it works on your network. This version won't play nice with Verizon or Sprint, so if you're on either of those carriers you can rule this out. If you live outside the US then this is definitely for you. Shipping appears to be free in the US, but here in the UK, it's $18.99. That still works out a bargain for me, especially if you account for the exchange rate. You'll have to do the sums from where you are to see if the deal is as good for you. It's worth mentioning that getting your warranty honored might be tough with this type of purchase, so bear that in mind. It's hard to say how many of these they have, other than a "limited quantity," so you'll have to be quick if you want to get your hands on arguably the best Android phone of 2016. Update 1: 2017/05/26 2:32pm PDT It looks like the price has dropped another $25, making this a $75 savings in total. For a device that hasn't seen much in the way of price drops or sales since launch, $75 off isn't bad. Anyone interested in a Pixel that uses a network compatible with this international model should give it a serious think.

Andy What do you mean? jonzey231 If you don't buy the phone from Google, they won't help you. They send you to the manufacturer. I was forced to go to Huawei for my 6P and it was a little over 3 weeks before I got it back....and the problem is still there. Spend the extra $50 and buy it through Google so you're guaranteed to get support through their CS channels. You'll be glad you did in 6 months when something inevitably goes wrong. IMHO get the OnePlus 3T. Costs less but has better overall specs aside from the camera which is still pretty good in its own right. My brother has one and my roommate just got his last week and they both have no intention of going back to a major brand ever again. YaKillaCJ Same happened when I got the OnePlus One. It changed the way I (and many others) view a "budget" device from an unknown brand. needa I felt the same way after using an OPO for nearly three years. Got me an XL in mint condition for $450. Google edition even. Still had 3520 mAh in the batt too. Would have bought the black 3T had they been in stock. Took me three days to hunt down this deal. Andy Got my wife the pixel. Runs great. Just had the microphone problem. Google swapped without question. Wife seems to think it takes horrible selfies. Rod Weird, as it's cameras are regarded among the best currently. Random! @andy maybe you should let her know that the camera isn't the problem... It's actually her face. If you do warn her about this, I promise to visit you at the hospital. Andy Thanks for the tip. VAVAMk_2 Huzzah! Master Yates Agreed with you regarding the 3T. Lets see if the excellent updates and support evaporate when the One Plus 5 is released? That's the real test. IcerC Except in this case Google is the Manufacturer, that might change things. VAVAMk_2 Google didn't make the camera. Uses a Sony made sensor but the camera software is Google's and regarded among the best in post processing, particularly HDR. Roy Ahh so nice call me when the 1+2 will get Nougat and your friend will get or never get Android O. ddevito #Fail Andy S8 release response? AdMoc Does not ship to Poland as fck always -_- Random! Look for some service like Shipito. I believe they have an EU warehouse. Shakil Shaikh $60 shipping? kristin ANY Pixel made by google is compatible with any provider. It doesnt matter if its international or not. This writer is an odiot. Scott Scrivens https://www.techwalls.com/google-pixel-pixel-xl-model-number-differences/ Kevin Davis "Odiot", lmao. 😂 Oh, and you're wrong, too. kristin I called google about this. It would be up your phone company provider whether it worked or not. So it may not work with att or tmobile either. kristin This may or may not work on any provider. Its up to the provider. You want a pixel? Go to swappa.com and get one used in mint condition for much cheaper. Ive gotten a few phones from them since ive been on project fi and had no issues. Ill never buy a new phone again. Random! $50 off? How cute... If they get to $300 off ($350 final price) within a month, I might even convince myself it's worth to stare at those bezels everyday. Other than that (impossible) scenario, I'd rather get the 3T, Axon 7, or even the LG G5. Gjorgi Lazarovski The Pixel is probably not dropping in price anytime soon. iKon The most overrated smartphone of 2016. Only the camera is decent. Ugly ass design, overpriced and dull with no features compared to competition Roy You mean the best smartphone of 2016, best camera rare band front, best software, best updates. Great battery, great display. xyz No, he means "The most overrated smartphone of 2016. Only the camera is decent. Ugly ass design, overpriced and dull with no features compared to competition." Roy No, I'm sure he/she means "the best smartphone of 2016, best camera rare band front, best software, best updates. Great battery, great display". iKon No I meant what I said. The pixel is a flop and even Google knows it. No matter how much money they put into advertising there are alot of better choices out there.. only hard core Google fanboys try and big it up Roy Yes yada yada and still every reviewer said is the best smartphone of 2016. So.. even David here. In the on of the day it's a lots about the UI and I just don't like Samsung software. Ordeith LOL. You're such a Google sycophant, Roy. Roy You feeling really smart? I'm Imagine your ass all over your face. nirmitlamed Google is so off track in figuring out what customers wants and competing against the other monstrous companies. I would very much like to hear how many Pixels Google sold in the last year since they told us they sold more than they expected. Lawrence I can put my coffee cup on the Bezel David Nowicki I'm a big Nexus fan, but why would you pay $749 for the Pixel XL vs the OnePlus 3T at about half the price ? And soon the OnePlus 5 at $450 or so with S8+ specs will be a steal compared to the Pixel 4Ui812 Supply and demand. Limit the supply and you increase demand. It's like P.T.

Fake websites are sprouting up almost daily and appear on search engines like Google when unwary travellers tap in popular destinations in their hunt for a summer getaway. Families looking for the perfect villa in the sun assume their search has produced listings of authentic lettings companies and often follow instructions to book directly with the owner of their chosen property. Duped: Mark High, above, was taken in by a bogus website and lost £4,500 But on closer inspection an increasing number of these websites are fake. Many are convincing copies of genuine websites, often put together by scammers using images and adapted wording culled from genuine travel firms' web pages.  These can be combined with photos of professional people from random websites around the world who are presented as holiday property owners or agents.

Share this article Share 71 shares HOW THIS IS MONEY CAN HELP Get more for your holiday money: The best debit and credit cards to beat overseas fees HOOKING HOLIDAYMAKERS One way fraudsters can achieve immediate high positions on search engine listings is by taking part in 'pay per click' campaigns where the engine company makes a small charge to show adverts above the natural website searches. Tap in 'villa holidays', for example, and many legitimate companies appear. But in among these lurk bogus websites that have also signed up. Nick Cooper, co-founder of long-established villa rental firm VillaPlus, has made it his mission to unmask fraudsters.  He says: 'Fake villa holiday websites are being given a helping hand by multi-billion pound companies who should be doing more to help tackle fraud.' He adds: 'Web hosting companies also refuse to close down fake websites, without an expensive court order or police intervention, despite being shown clear evidence of fraud.  'Meanwhile, these fake companies can run major ad campaigns, appearing high up on Google searches for months before finally being stopped.' In a statement Google said: 'We have a set of policies which govern what ads we do and do not allow.  'These policies make it clear that we do not allow fraudulent or misrepresentative websites. If we discover websites that are breaking this policy, we quickly take appropriate action.' Travellers also need to be wary that fake websites often hook them in with worthless booking guarantees promising refunds in the event someone chooses to cancel.  Feeling reassured, bookers pay the rental by bank transfer. But the cash is usually withdrawn as soon as it has landed in the fraudster's account – which is usually based abroad. HUNT FOR CLUES The Mail on Sunday carried out a reverse image search on a picture of apparent property agent Alexios Panagakos featured on bogus website greekvillaescapes.com.  This is the website that tricked readers Julie and David (not their real names) out of £6,000 in a case featured last month.  The photo is in fact that of an executive from an insurance firm in the US, which appears on his LinkedIn profile. To do a reverse image search, first click on the photo and then right click on the option 'search Google for image'.  Results will appear showing pictures that are visually similar as well as listings for pages that include the exact same photo. Some fake websites flip the stolen photos of properties in a bid to prevent internet image searches exposing the fraud.  As this paper reported earlier this month the scourge of bogus websites is increasing as the summer holiday season looms closer. A report by the City of London Police revealed a 20 per cent leap in reported holiday frauds in 2016 with more than 100 people a week losing on average in excess of £1,200 each.  The figure is likely to be far higher as victims are often too embarrassed to report they have been tricked. After reading our reports, reader Mark High feared the worst for a booking he and his wife Kerry had made less than 36 hours previously.  Mark discovered to his horror that they had been scammed out of £4,532 after booking a villa in Tenerife through sham website Canaries Holiday Villas – a website Nick Cooper warned Google about more than a month earlier. The couple have arranged villas previously online without a problem – and always paid by bank transfer rather than credit card so did not suspect crooks were at work.  He says: 'We discovered the villa was real but is only available through genuine agency James Villas that had already rented it for our dates. We realised then we had been conned.' The Highs, from Lincolnshire, contacted their bank HSBC immediately. But the call centre told them there was nothing that could be done.  The Mail on Sunday intervened and HSBC took a fresh look. After contacting the receiving bank in Dublin the bank managed to retrieve the couple's money. Gas engineer Mark says: 'We were disappointed with HSBC for fobbing us off and are sorry that it took The Mail on Sunday to make them act.  'But we are overjoyed they did the right thing and we can now take our children on holiday as planned.  'It was supposed to be a treat for us all after my wife's mother died and left us some money.  'The children were so upset when they thought it wouldn't happen.'  The couple came forward because they 'do not want this to happen to other families'. MORE ACTION NEEDED Critics believe both internet search engines and banks need to take more comprehensive action to protect customers. Martyn James, of consumer complaints website Resolver, says: 'Fraud works because the fraudsters are clever, manipulative and convincing.' Fight: Martyn James says banks must take action He adds: 'While banks aren't responsible for the actions of fraudsters, they do have an obligation to their customers to do all they can to get their cash back the moment they are told there is a problem.  'Suspicious transfers should not take place immediately and warnings about transferring money to strangers could easily be given in person or online.' Meanwhile, payments firms are debating how to combat bank transfer fraud and industry group The Payment Strategy Forum is proposing a 'confirmation of payee' system.  This aims to help people avoid sending payments to the wrong account, either by accident or being tricked into doing so – by ensuring confirmation of the recipient is sent to the payer before funds leave the original account. A spokesperson for Lloyds Bank says it will always try to retrieve the funds if asked in a process that can take 28 days. She adds: 'Where customers are delayed in reporting, the chances of obtaining a full recovery are low.' Julie and David heard last week that their quick action following reading our warnings meant the bank has managed to retrieve the majority of their lost £6,000. HOW THE POLICE TARGET RIP-OFF SCHEMES With fraudsters often based abroad to better evade detection it can be hard for police to track them down and take action.  So police tactics involve attempting to undermine the scammers' operations instead. The City of London Police runs Action Fraud, the national reporting centre for all types of internet fraud. Vigilant: City of London Police have a 'disruptions team' for fraud It has a 'disruptions team' where officers work with banks, internet services and technology companies to tackle rip-off schemes.  A spokesman says: 'Last year, we requested 160,000 phone lines, websites (including travel websites) and bank accounts be closed in order to disrupt these fraudsters.' Since hoaxers often set up new websites as quickly as the old ones are closed, detectives instead put emphasis on warning holidaymakers and making suggestions on how they can protect themselves.  CUT YOUR TRAVEL MONEY COSTS  Most credit and debit cards will charge hefty fees of around 3 per cent for foreign transactions, with extra charges for withdrawing cash abroad. There are several current accounts and credit cards which offer reduced fees or waive overseas charges altogether. If you would rather not change banks, currency cards offer holidaymakers the chance to load up a card with money to spend while they are away and potentially benefit from lower rates. Travellers should make sure these rates are better than their bank and check all the small print but typically these cards offer highly competitive exchange rates plus zero exchange rate fees  You can find out more about how these cards can help you save money and where to find the best deals in our roundup here.   FairFX is offering This is Money and MailOnline readers a free mastercard prepaid currency exchange card, which usually costs £9.95 THIS IS MONEY'S FIVE OF THE BEST CREDIT CARDS MBNA's Platinum Credit Card gives 42 months of 0% interest on balance transfers - the second longest deal available (2.79% handling fee applies).

The new feature, which was spotted by Search Engine Roundtable, works when you are logged into your Gmail account, and of course, when you do a normal Google search. However, you won’t spot or be able to use the new feature if you are not logged into your account. Above, you can see the new feature, with a new tab “personal” added to the dropdown menu. What happens when you try searching without logging in? That’s a fairly simple question, and the answer of course, is that the personal feature won’t appear. The feature like I said, only works when you log into your account. As soon as you log in, your search results will be presented according to what you have in your Gmail and Google Photos. It’s not a huge addition, but one that could add some fun to how you search when using Google. You will also have to click on the “More” menu to access the “Personal” tab to be able to use it. Being able to search your personal data is one that will please a lot of people—and that’s why I think the feature will attract a lot of people. If you haven’t spotted it yet, that’s because it’s gradually being rolled out by Google, and could take a few more days to reach a global audience. The fact that you can carry out all your searches from a single and simple interface, makes the feature a welcome one. It will go a long way in helping people spend more time on Google’s search page because they can access all the personal and general data they need. For those asking, the feature works on both mobile and web versions of Google, and so it’s a welcome development. So, wherever you go and whatever platform [mobile or web], accessing the new feature isn’t going to be an issue for you. Google has alleviated any issue or doubt that might arise as a result of privacy. The company added a notice right below your image, assuring that “Only you can see these results.” That should calm a lot of nerves in these days of constant vulnerability issue on the internet. The worry for me is, when you try to log into your Gmail or Photos account on a shared computer. This is a big worry because a friend or a third-party can easily view or access your private data or photos. I have tried out the new feature, and I think it’s fun to use.

It seems like the Google Nexus 6P device is the last of the Nexus brand and apparently it’s replacement is something completely different. While the Nexus 6P was £449, Google raises the price for Pixel and Pixel XL handsets at about £599 and £719, respectively. The new Pixel devices are extremely good but the price place it along with the Apple iPhone 7 Plus and Samsung Galaxy S8. I mean, it has great features but are they worth £240 more? Not so much. Right now the Nexus 6P is nowhere to find, and you can have it only if you’re willing to search through second hand markets, where you can get a great deal and pay less. It’s a shame that Google thought it would be better to increase the payment. Review It was released in 2014. Although it was a pretty good phone, the size of it was enormous, so we got Nexus 6P. It’s lighter, slimmer and smaller, with a 5.7inch display, similar to the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, Note 5 and iPhone 6sPlus. What’s new Besides those other changes, the Motorola manufacturer lets Huawei Chinese technology to take over. Huawei’s experience can be seen in the Nexus 6P’s design. In this area, it is clearly better than Nexus 6 because it’s less slippery and bulky than it was the older model and this is very important to a lot of people. The screen is protected by Gorilla Glass 4 to prevent scratches and drops. It even has the new Type-C USB ports, which leaves a mark on all the new soon to be launched devices and promises faster charging! It’s more robust than the Micro-USB version and it’s easier to plug your cable in the USB port without the fear of breaking it. You can also reverse the power and charge other devices using your phone.

Home Mail News Sport Finance Celebrity Style Weather Answers Flickr Mobile More Yahoo Search Search News Home Follow us UK Yahoo Originals General Election 17 World Finance Celebrity Sport Science & Tech Motoring TV Movies Style Weather News Video Viral Google’s latest Go victory shows machines are no longer just learning, they're teaching Mark Robert Anderson, Professor in Computing and Information Systems, Edge Hill University The Conversation 26 May 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share Just over 20 years ago was the first time a computer beat a human world champion in a chess match, when IBM’s Deep Blue supercomputer beat Gary Kasparov in a narrow victory of 3½ games to 2½. Just under a decade later, machines were deemed to have conquered the game of chess when Deep Fritz, a piece of software running on a desktop PC, beat 2006 world champion Vladimir Kramnik. Now the ability of computers to take on humanity has taken a step further by mastering the far more complex board game Go, with Google’s AlphaGo program beating world number one Ke Jie twice in a best-of-three series. This signifcant milestone shows just how far computers have come in the past 20 years. DeepBlue’s victory at chess showed machines could rapidly process huge amounts of information, paving the way for the big data revolution we see today. But AlphaGo’s triumph represents the development of real artificial intelligence by a machine that can recognise patterns and learn the best way to respond to them. What’s more, it may signify a new evolution in AI, where computers not only learn how to beat us but can start to teach us as well. Go is considered one of the world’s most complex board games. Like chess, it’s a game of strategy but it also has several key differences that make it much harder for a computer to play. The rules are relatively simple but the strategies involved to play the game are highly complex. It is also much harder to calculate the end position and winner in the game of Go. It has a larger board (a 19x19 grid rather than an 8x8 one) and an unlimited number of pieces, so there are many more ways that the board can be arranged. Whereas chess pieces start in set positions and can each make a limited number of moves each turn, Go starts with a blank board and players can place a piece in any of the 361 free spaces. Each game takes on average twice as many turns as chess and there are six times as many legal move options per turn. Each of these features means you can’t build a Go program using the same techniques as for chess machines. These tend to use a “brute force” approach of analysing the potential of large numbers of possible moves to select the best one. Feng-Hsiung Hsu, one of the key contributors to the DeepBlue team, argued in 2007 that applying this strategy to Go would require a million-fold increase in processing speed over DeepBlue so a computer could analyse 100 trillion positions per second. Learning new moves The strategy used by AlphaGo’s creators at Google subsidiary DeepMind was to create an artificial intelligence program that could learn how to identify favourable moves from useless ones. This meant it wouldn’t have to analyse all the possible moves that could be made at each turn. In preparation for its first match against professional Go player Lee Sedol, AlphaGo analysed around 300m moves made by professional Go players. It then used what are called deep learning and reinforcement learning techniques to develop its own ability to identify favourable moves. But this wasn’t enough to enable AlphaGo to defeat highly ranked human players. The software was run on custom microchips specifically designed for machine learning, known as tensor processing units (TPUs), to support very large numbers of computations. This seems similar to the approach used by the designers of DeepBlue, who also developed custom chips for high-volume computation. The stark difference, however, is that DeepBlue’s chips could only be used for playing chess. AlphaGo’s chips run Google’s general-purpose AI framework, Tensorflow, and are also used to power other Google services such as Street View and optimisation tasks in the firm’s data centres. Lesson for us all The other thing that has changed since DeepBlue’s victory is the respect that humans have for their computer opponents. When playing chess computers, it was common for the human players to adopt so-called anti-computer tactics. This involves making conservative moves to prevent the computer from evaluating positions effectively. In his first match against AlphaGo, however, Ke Jie, adopted tactics that had previously been used by his opponent to beat it at its own game. Although this attempt failed, it demonstrates a change in approach for leading human players taking on computers. Instead of trying to stifle the machine, they have begun trying to learn from how it played in the past. Read More In fact, the machine has already influenced the professional game of Go, with grandmasters adopting AlphaGo’s strategy during their tournament matches. This machine has taught humanity something new about a game it has been playing for over 2,500 years, liberating us from the experience of millennia. What then might the future hold for the AI behind AlphaGo? The success of DeepBlue triggered rapid developments that have directly impacted the techniques applied in big data processing. The benefit of the technology used to implement AlphaGo is that it can already be applied to other problems that require pattern identification. For example, the same techniques have been applied to the detection of cancer and to create robots that can learn to do things like open doors, among many other applications. The underlying framework used in AlphaGo, Google’s TensorFlow, has been made freely available for developers and researchers to build new machine-learning programs using standard computer hardware. More excitingly, combining it with the many computers available through the internet cloud creates the promise of delivering machine-learning supercomputing. When this technology matures then the potential will exist for the creation of self-taught machines in wide-ranging roles that can support complex decision-making tasks. Of course, what may be even more profound are the social impacts of having machines that not only teach themselves but teach us in the process.

[Update: Now $75 Off] Deal Alert: Pixel 32GB (international version) is $50 off on eBay Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/05/26 2:20pm PDTMay 26, 2017 2 Plus 1 on G+ 53 Share on Facebook 57 Share on Twitter Total Shares112 Deals News Pixel Update 1: 2017/05/26 2:32pm PDT It looks like the price has dropped another $25, making this a $75 savings in total. For a device that hasn't seen much in the way of price drops or It's no secret that Google has had some serious supply issues with its flagship Pixel phone. That goes for pretty much any combination of size, color, or storage. Rumors even began to surface alleging that Google had stopped production of the devices altogether. That wasn't the case, but nonetheless, you will still struggle to actually find the Pixel if you wish to buy it. A 32GB Pixel (international version) on eBay for $50 off the list price could be the answer to that problem. This is the entry level 5" Pixel, with 32GB of storage in the color Very Silver - and it's available for $599. That's $50 less than the $649 Google is still charging for it. Beware though, this is the international version of the device. So if you live in the US you'll have to check the bands to see if it works on your network. This version won't play nice with Verizon or Sprint, so if you're on either of those carriers you can rule this out. If you live outside the US then this is definitely for you. Shipping appears to be free in the US, but here in the UK, it's $18.99. That still works out a bargain for me, especially if you account for the exchange rate. You'll have to do the sums from where you are to see if the deal is as good for you. It's worth mentioning that getting your warranty honored might be tough with this type of purchase, so bear that in mind. It's hard to say how many of these they have, other than a "limited quantity," so you'll have to be quick if you want to get your hands on arguably the best Android phone of 2016. Update 1: 2017/05/26 2:32pm PDT It looks like the price has dropped another $25, making this a $75 savings in total. For a device that hasn't seen much in the way of price drops or sales since launch, $75 off isn't bad. Anyone interested in a Pixel that uses a network compatible with this international model should give it a serious think.

Andy What do you mean? jonzey231 If you don't buy the phone from Google, they won't help you. They send you to the manufacturer. I was forced to go to Huawei for my 6P and it was a little over 3 weeks before I got it back....and the problem is still there. Spend the extra $50 and buy it through Google so you're guaranteed to get support through their CS channels. You'll be glad you did in 6 months when something inevitably goes wrong. IMHO get the OnePlus 3T. Costs less but has better overall specs aside from the camera which is still pretty good in its own right. My brother has one and my roommate just got his last week and they both have no intention of going back to a major brand ever again. YaKillaCJ Same happened when I got the OnePlus One. It changed the way I (and many others) view a "budget" device from an unknown brand. needa I felt the same way after using an OPO for nearly three years. Got me an XL in mint condition for $450. Google edition even. Still had 3520 mAh in the batt too. Would have bought the black 3T had they been in stock. Took me three days to hunt down this deal. Andy Got my wife the pixel. Runs great. Just had the microphone problem. Google swapped without question. Wife seems to think it takes horrible selfies. Rod Weird, as it's cameras are regarded among the best currently. Random! @andy maybe you should let her know that the camera isn't the problem... It's actually her face. If you do warn her about this, I promise to visit you at the hospital. Andy Thanks for the tip. VAVAMk_2 Huzzah! Master Yates Agreed with you regarding the 3T. Lets see if the excellent updates and support evaporate when the One Plus 5 is released? That's the real test. IcerC Except in this case Google is the Manufacturer, that might change things. VAVAMk_2 Google didn't make the camera. Uses a Sony made sensor but the camera software is Google's and regarded among the best in post processing, particularly HDR. Roy Ahh so nice call me when the 1+2 will get Nougat and your friend will get or never get Android O. ddevito #Fail Andy S8 release response? AdMoc Does not ship to Poland as fck always -_- Random!

Scott Scrivens https://www.techwalls.com/google-pixel-pixel-xl-model-number-differences/ Kevin Davis "Odiot", lmao. 😂 Oh, and you're wrong, too. kristin I called google about this. It would be up your phone company provider whether it worked or not. So it may not work with att or tmobile either. kristin This may or may not work on any provider. Its up to the provider. You want a pixel? Go to swappa.com and get one used in mint condition for much cheaper. Ive gotten a few phones from them since ive been on project fi and had no issues. Ill never buy a new phone again. Random! $50 off? How cute... If they get to $300 off ($350 final price) within a month, I might even convince myself it's worth to stare at those bezels everyday. Other than that (impossible) scenario, I'd rather get the 3T, Axon 7, or even the LG G5. Gjorgi Lazarovski The Pixel is probably not dropping in price anytime soon. iKon The most overrated smartphone of 2016. Only the camera is decent. Ugly ass design, overpriced and dull with no features compared to competition Roy You mean the best smartphone of 2016, best camera rare band front, best software, best updates. Great battery, great display. xyz No, he means "The most overrated smartphone of 2016. Only the camera is decent. Ugly ass design, overpriced and dull with no features compared to competition." Roy No, I'm sure he/she means "the best smartphone of 2016, best camera rare band front, best software, best updates. Great battery, great display". iKon No I meant what I said. The pixel is a flop and even Google knows it. No matter how much money they put into advertising there are alot of better choices out there.. only hard core Google fanboys try and big it up Roy Yes yada yada and still every reviewer said is the best smartphone of 2016. So.. even David here. In the on of the day it's a lots about the UI and I just don't like Samsung software. Ordeith LOL. You're such a Google sycophant, Roy. Roy You feeling really smart? I'm Imagine your ass all over your face. nirmitlamed Google is so off track in figuring out what customers wants and competing against the other monstrous companies. I would very much like to hear how many Pixels Google sold in the last year since they told us they sold more than they expected. Lawrence I can put my coffee cup on the Bezel David Nowicki I'm a big Nexus fan, but why would you pay $749 for the Pixel XL vs the OnePlus 3T at about half the price ? And soon the OnePlus 5 at $450 or so with S8+ specs will be a steal compared to the Pixel 4Ui812 Supply and demand. Limit the supply and you increase demand. It's like P.T. Barnum said , "There's a sucker born every minute".

Digital Trends Home > Web > Vietnam says Google will help remove… Vietnam says Google will help remove "toxic" content from platform By Lulu Chang — Updated May 28, 2017 2:38 pm Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you The Vietnamese government claims that the search giant will be assisting in its efforts to remove anti-government content from its platform. Google is said to be helping Vietnam censor its platform. On Friday, the country’s government revealed that the search giant’s parent company, Alphabet, will be cooperating with Vietnam to remove so-called “toxic” and illegal information. The nation has previously borne criticism for its treatment of dissidents and anti-government personalities, having arrested many who have spoken out against the communist regime. The Southeast Asian regime raised concerns about “offensive” content on Facebook and YouTube (the Google-owned video platform) back in February, and persuaded Vietnamese companies to hold onto their advertising budgets until the American firms were able to address government issues. And now, it seems as though at least one company has made those adjustments. During a meeting with Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc in Hanoi on Friday, Alphabet Chairman Eric Schmidt assured Vietnam’s officials that the company would work closely alongside the administration to uphold the country’s laws. “Mr. Eric Schmidt said (he) will tightly cooperate with Vietnam to remove toxic information violating Vietnamese laws and will consider opening a representative office in the country,” the Vietnamese government said in a statement on its website. However, Google has its separate account of these discussions, with spokesman Taj Meadows telling Reuters, “We have clear policies for removal requests from governments around the world, and those policies have not changed.” He continued, “We rely on governments to notify us of content that they believe is illegal through official processes, and where appropriate, will restrict it after a thorough review.” The prime minister was not the only person with whom Schmidt met during his visit to Vietnam. In fact, Schmidt held an audience with Vietnamese singer and activist Mai Khoi, who told Reuters, “I told Eric about Vietnam’s internet censorship issue and he said he knew about it and would try to improve internet freedom here in a delicate way.”

Google is now offering four free months of Google Play Music for new subscribers Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/26 2:17pm PDTMay 26, 2017 82 Plus 1 on G+ 614 Share on Facebook 102 Share on Twitter Total Shares798 Google News Right now it looks like Google is running a special offer for Google Play Music. New subscribers that sign up here can get four free months of service instead of the usual three. No telling how long this offer might last, so if you have been considering subscribing, now might be the time to do it. It could save you an extra $10. Again, this particular offer is only for new subscribers. I've been a fan of Play Music for a long time, though the device removal limit does get in the way when you switch between devices and ROMs as often as I do. Being able to mix your own library with those of a service also comes in handy. That way I can continue to support artists I am passionate about, without eschewing the larger selection of a subscription offering for the purposes of content discovery, all while being able to fill the gaps in that library. There are a lot of different music services out there, but if you're interested combining your curated library with music available via a subscription, then your options are limited. Spotify does allow you to play back locally stored files, which is convenient, but it isn't quite the same. Amazon also allows you to upload your music for playback via Amazon Music, and with Amazon Prime membership, you get a small library of streaming music to go along with that. For $10 a month ($8 for Prime members) you can access their full library as well. But, Google Play Music has a great interface and plugs nicely into all the other Google services we love. Maybe with this new offer, it's time you gave Google Play Music a chance? After all, even if it doesn't end up working out, you still got four free months of music out of the deal.

Carson Saldanha Wait, wdym 3 different countries? Did you share it with others or something? Ailín Ó’S I live in Ireland, so that's my main account. I have a secondary account based in England as part of a mail forwarder service I use, and my bf is Greek so I had him check the code on his account :) Carson Saldanha Oh wow! Carson Saldanha Hey, since I know it worked for you, are you able to use YouTube Red along with this Play Music free trial? Because my YT Red doesn't seem to be enabled for me. Ailín Ó’S No, unfortunately not as I live in the EU and YouTube Red is only available in USA. Carson Saldanha Weird, I'm in the US though. Ailín Ó’S Ooh that is odd. Sign out of the app then sign back in maybe? Carson Saldanha No luck :( I'm in contact with Google support atm Hopefully they can sort this out Mike Worth it alone for Youtube Red MisterAlex Sweet, I wasn't sure if that was included. Thanks. Should mention that in the main blog post. Ben Still no student membership >:( Ailín Ó’S Spotify is a great alternative @€$£5/month. Ben I know that's what I use just because it's half the price. Ailín Ó’S In Ireland Vodafone have a partnership with Spotify whereby it costs €5 standard instead of €10 regardless of if you're a student or not, they even bundle it with some of their plans. Vodafone do the same in some other countries they operate in (not all). Maybe see if any network in your country has a partnership like that? Worth a shot! Ben Oh yeah I'm on EE in the UK and I've got Apple Music for free for 6 months but like iTunes is a massive stinking turd. Ailín Ó’S I'd rather go back to the days of getting music via Bluetooth from friends than use crApple Music 😂😂 Rahul Krishna In india, we have play music for 1.4 usd/month Umang Ladia I'm only seeing 2 months offer in India.?? Rahul Krishna Well I subscribed to it when it launched here (about 2 months ago), so I can't confirm that. But at this price, there is nothing to be disappointed about. aRvInD I wish Spotify launches soon here. I can't keep using that patched version here...!! Rahul Krishna Me too xyz As it should be, you can't charge European or American prices in India. Rahul Krishna Yes true. There are lots​ of people here with a very cheap Android phone. They cannot pay much money. Julian Coronado That's actually what's keeping me away from Play Music. I've used my free months and I loved the Youtube Red too. But as a student, Spotify for $5 / month is too great to pass up on. Emiliejmosley Google is paying 97$ per hour! Work for few hours & have longer with friends and family! !sm141c: On tuesday I got a great new Land Rover Range Rover from having earned $8752 this last four weeks.. Its the most-financialy rewarding I've had..

Cakefish Spotify ftw ToniCipriani ✓pǝᴉɟᴉɹǝʌ I don't think this is a new offer, got this a while back. In fact my 4 months is expiring next week. Prefer Spotify over it. Song selection a tad bit weaker, and for foreign songs it tries to translate the song names to English and makes it hard to look up. folkrav I like it, it's way cheaper than Spotify for me - my mother, my sister, my wife and myself each pay 30$ a year and we're set - but Jesus do I hate the clients. I don't like the website's interface, I hate the Android app. But yeah, I'll deal with it cause it's cheap, I guess. Carson Saldanha Got it! Yay! Jim I wish I could somehow get it on my Amazon Echo hahaha. I guess if I had paid for a Google Home it would be worth trying out. Forget vega #getEVGA Why google play music isn't available in my country ? Ailín Ó’S Try Apple Music? They seem to be just about everywhere. Iamsecond And this is why Apple continue to dominate, because Apple are truly interested in being an international company whereas Google is just playing at it. Such a shame xyz Because Google sucks. Bartek Juszczak My GPM radio's are so good these days I love that Google is so into AI. Whether It's just "I'm being lucky" or radio from a specific song, band or album they very rarely disappoint me these days. I just make sure to thumbs up if it plays a song I particularly love. I am a student and could go cheaper with spotify but the AI generated playlists have me locked in. If it's £5 cheaper but I'm not gonna enjoy it nearly as much then it's not really a good deal. AndTheWorldMayNeverKnow I used the 3 or 4 months free trial during the holidays then bought the family plan for $14.99 a month. 4 people in my family us it and it works great, the app could use some tweaks but it's really good overall. paev If you listen to main stream music it doesn't really matter what service to use. However, if you like something unusual, weird or other languages then Google is a way to go. I found bands on Google music that Spotify displayed as not found. Google also have new synth bands that Spotify doesn't. I'm for Google too. Daniel I discovered that GPM is kinda like a music label. I once went to a section of Google play explaining how indie artists can use GPM like a music label as long as they own all their rights. Ryne Hager Ultraista (among others) keeps me using Google Play Music as well as Spotify. Carson Saldanha Does anyone else who activated the Play Music trial have YouTube Red working as well? My YT Red doesn't seem to be enabled while my Play Music is. Michael Carr I spotted a similar offer a couple of months ago, and I took it after a day or two's thought. Just last week, I moved directly into a family plan. PewPewYoureDead It's hard to recommend Google Play Music until they revamp the UI. Margaritas Ante Porcos Google Music is the only choice in some markets, like Russia, where no Spotify or Pandora are available. There are too many shortcomings in Google Music and Google never shows interest in making services better than below average. I really wonder why Google refuses to become the best at anything. Real magic here. Pixel syndrome all the way. Yet Google Music is on my phone and I use it because there's no choice whatsoever. Rob You answered your own question. If there's no alternative, then they don't have any incentive to improve the service. SupahNin10doh Stupid Dorito logo... Raymond Berger Huh, I just subscribed to the trial but you youtube red hasn't kicked in yet. Any idea how long it takes? Iamsecond If you live in the UK, about 2 years so far h20ray Google Play Music is currently available in select territories and for select account types. Umang Ladia I'm only seeing 2 months offer in India, anybody can confirm? Mohammad Ovais Yeah, same for me. Maybe it's region limited. Isolde I think you need to open the link in a browser, if you open it in the app it's just the normal 2 months. bligui Confirmed need to open it from link and it works Manoj | Blogging Triggers Is Google Music really worth to it? We have better alternatives Sathiya Moorthy Karan I came across a great post, it seems to be so cool http://developeit.net/android-news-image-scanner-finder/ Zachariah Mann It only shows up as 2 free months for me. I live in Michigan. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a19b7e9dddb67bf897c751aedf63c01917048214140db901fd783b2182d8d5c0.png Jefferson Rodrigues https://play.google.com/music/listen?coupon=120DFREE&coupontype=vanity#/sulp Zachariah Mann That link still brought me to the same page on the Play Music App which offers 2 months free. Does it matter if I'm opening it on a computer or web page? Jefferson Rodrigues I don't know. Mikael Jakobsson Should mabye joine premium at Google Music if that coste like $2 max a month dont understand why they should take as mutch as someone some has app or Win32 software to PC so music controllers one they keyboards works. Tab out frome a game for pause music when the round is over is just bad. Arif Gürü And stil isnt available on Turkey xyz "No telling how long this offer might last, so if you have been considering subscribing, now might be the time to do it." No thanks, I'll just use YouTube. Only thing YT needs is an option to play audio only so I can save a wee bit more data when I don't need video. Cai Copley Nope. If it wasn't for the fact work pays for Spotify Premium and the fact Spotify has Crossfade to emulate a DJ system, maybe I'd give it a whirl. bligui Not working any more to bad Follow Android Police 1.49M 472k 145k 119k Latest Deals 9 [Deal Alert] Chromecast Ultra is $59.99 ($10 off) at Google Store, Best Buy, B&H and others 2017/06/04 12:16pm PDTJun 4, 2017 13 [Deal Alert] Google Home is $109 ($20 off) at Best Buy, Google Store, B&H, and others 2017/06/04 10:07am PDTJun 4, 2017 12 [Deal Alert] Kick off the weekend with 24 temporarily free and 52 on-sale apps 2017/06/03 6:50pm PDTJun 3, 2017 18 [Deal Alert] Get a Nextbit Robin for $129.99 on eBay 2017/06/03 9:39am PDTJun 3, 2017 33 [Deal Alert] A Stork's Journey is currently free on Google Play Movies & TV 2017/06/01 10:50pm PDTJun 1, 2017 Latest Poll How many photos are on your Google Photos account?

Investors could be blaming the wrong CEO for IBM’s current problems. Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) May 27, 2017 at 2:00PM Back in March, I discussed five reasons that IBM (NYSE:IBM) could benefit from a change in management. I noted that its revenue declines wouldn't end anytime soon, that the growth of its key "strategic imperatives" was slowing down, that it remained an underdog in the cloud race, that it was too dependent on outsourcing, and that it wasn't being upfront about its layoffs. While those are still valid points, we should acknowledge that Ginni Rometty was dealt a tough hand when she became the company's ninth CEO in 2012. So today, we'll examine some of Rometty's biggest moves, and whether or not they actually moved IBM in the right direction. IBM CEO Ginni Rometty. Image source: IBM. Paying for Palmisano's mistakes Former CEO Sam Palmisano -- who led IBM from 2002 to 2011 -- arguably set the company on the wrong path in 2010, when he boldly promised to double its annual earnings per share from $10.01 in 2009 to $20 by 2015. That proclamation was so impressive that Warren Buffett, who famously avoided tech stocks, made it one of Berkshire Hathaway's top holdings. The problem was that Palmisano's "Roadmap 2015" plan mainly consisted of selling big business units (like its PC business, which it sold to Lenovo in 2004), aggressively cutting costs, and repurchasing stock. That conservative strategy boosted IBM's earnings but caused it to fall behind the tech curve as rival companies -- like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google -- invested heavily in cloud-based platforms. Abandoning Roadmap 2015 When Rometty took over, she initially followed Palmisano's playbook by cutting costs, laying off employees, and dumping lower-margin business units. The company even paid GlobalFoundries $1.5 billion to take over its money-losing chipmaking business, and its debt levels surged as it funded more buybacks with debt. But in late 2014, Rometty wisely abandoned Palmisano's $20 per share target. This decision finally gave Rometty the freedom to pursue more acquisitions in the higher-growth cloud and mobility markets. Laying down the foundations of its "strategic imperatives" Even before she scrapped Roadmap 2015, Rometty realized that IBM had fallen far behind Amazon, Microsoft, and Google in public cloud platforms -- which lend out storage space, computing power, and development tools to companies and developers. That's why Rometty had IBM acquire cloud infrastructure giant SoftLayer Technologies for $2 billion in 2013. She followed that purchase with dozens of other takeovers of businesses in the cloud, analytics, mobility, security, and social industries -- the five pillars of growth which became IBM's "strategic imperatives". Revenue from those businesses rose 12% annually last quarter and accounted for 42% of IBM's top line over the past 12 months. Without Rometty's guidance, this new category of higher-growth businesses might not even exist. Investing in next-gen technologies Rometty also created dedicated business units for next-gen technologies. In 2014, IBM created a new unit for its AI platform Watson, which may help it counter similar AI efforts at Amazon's AWS, Microsoft's Azure, and Google's Cloud Machine Learning Service. The following year, IBM launched dedicated units for the Internet of Things (IoT) and Education markets -- which expanded its big data and analytics reach into both industries. It also launched Watson Health, a dedicated unit for gathering and analyzing healthcare records from millions of devices. The company is also currently expanding its presence in the cybersecurity, quantum computing, and blockchain markets -- which could widen its moat against its biggest rivals. Halting the buybacks After abandoning Palmisano's plan, Rometty finally weaned IBM off its addiction to debt-fueled buybacks, as seen in the following chart: Source: YCharts This bold move caused IBM's annual earnings to drop 10% in 2015 and 9% in 2016, but those declines were arguably necessary to allow the pursuit of other investments and acquisitions. Looking ahead, analysts expect IBM's cost-cutting plans, stabilizing (albeit stagnant) revenues, and investments in higher-margin businesses to lift its earnings by 1% this year and 2% next year. So should investors blame the management? Shares of IBM have declined 8% this year, while the S&P 500 has gained 8%. The reasons are easy to see -- the company's revenue has fallen annually for 20 straight quarters, Warren Buffett sold about 30% of Berkshire's stake in February, and Moody's downgraded its credit rating in early May. Amid all those negative headlines, it's easy to blame IBM's management for its current woes. However, it makes more sense to blame former CEO Sam Palmisano for most of those problems. Rometty initially waited too long to abandon Palmisano's quixotic plan, but her moves over the past three years indicate that she knows how to turn around the aging company. Therefore, investors should keep those facts in mind before assuming that IBM would fare better under new management.   Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Google co-founder Sergey Brin is spending between $100 million and $150 million to build an enormous blimp, The Guardian reports.More Google co-founder Sergey Brin is spending $100 million to $150 million to build a blimp that will be the world's biggest aircraft when it's finished, according to The Guardian. The blimp, as first reported by Bloomberg, is under construction at a giant hangar in the NASA Ames airfield near Google headquarters in Mountain View, California. Google signed a 60-year lease for $1.1 billion in 2014, through a subsidiary called Planetary Ventures, and is working with engineer Alan Weston, who is employed by a company known as LTA ("lighter than air") Research and Exploration. The company, controlled by Brin's family, was listed in Google's 2017 proxy as a lessor of part of the Ames hangar. The blimp will be almost 656 feet (200 meters) long, The Guardian reports, and will go on humanitarian missions to remote locations as well as serving as an "air yacht" for Brin and his family.

Resold Pixel phones originally purchased from Project Fi are having their IMEIs blacklisted Richard Gao Follow View All Posts 2017/05/25 5:30am PDTMay 25, 2017 59 Plus 1 on G+ 150 Share on Facebook 58 Share on Twitter Total Shares267 Google News Pixel Pixel XL Project Fi Back in November, when the Pixel was slowly beginning to ship to customers, there were numerous reports of people getting their Google accounts banned for purchasing Pixel and Pixel XL devices with the intent to resell them. It turns out that this issue hasn't exactly been laid to rest, as it seems that Pixel phones purchased from Project Fi for this purpose are now getting blacklisted via their IMEI numbers. As an overview, people originally bought Pixels from both the Google Store and Project Fi to sell them to a New Hampshire-based reseller. Why New Hampshire, you may ask? There's no sales tax. Both parties here were supposed to make a profit, but Google ended up banning a ton of accounts for a violation of their terms of service.. Considering how important Google is in our lives (Gmail, Google Photos, YouTube, Play Store, etc.), a lot of people were obviously not happy. In the end, Google did restore many of these accounts, but it was obviously enough for a good scare. However, it seems that Google still hasn't completely forgiven people for violating their ToS. Kyle Bennett, the editor-in-chief and founder of the HardOCP website, had his Pixel XL's IMEI blacklisted just yesterday. IMEIs are typically blacklisted by carriers when phones are lost or stolen, but that's clearly not what happened here. Calling T-Mobile didn't do anything, as their staff told him that they could not reverse the blacklisting. His communication with Swappa support was more interesting, though; here's what they told him: "Sorry to hear of the complaints. We have seen a great number of Pixel devices becoming blacklisted the past two days. We are still trying to figure out why this has happened to so many devices. We are working to find out the cause of this widespread issue. It would be best for both of you to keep on top of Google and pressing them for an explanation. In one other case, I saw this morning Google agreed to send the buyer a replacement device so that might be an option to look into. Seller please work with the buyer and Google to see if they can get to the bottom of it." Kyle then contacted Google support, with the first representative claiming that he had simply received a spam message. When he showed a second rep how his IMEI had indeed been blacklisted via Swappa's ESN/IMEI checker (useful tool if you're buying a phone, by the way), he was told that his Pixel XL hadn't been reported as stolen, but that it had been originally purchased through Project Fi. Kyle was also once again told that his phone hadn't really been blacklisted, but a quick rescan of his IMEI in Swappa proved otherwise. His case was escalated to Project Fi's support team, but the customer service rep refused to give him a reference number and told him that he'd receive it via email. After contacting a third representative, Kyle was informed that his phone had indeed been blacklisted, but that Google wasn't responsible for doing so. This lends further credence to the Project Fi explanation, as it's the carrier and not the manufacturer that has the ability to blacklist devices. The situation is still ongoing, but that's all we know for now; we'll update with more information as we get it.

Okay. NeverrKnowsBest You can sell a Project Fi phone. You just buy them in bulk and try to make a profit off Project Fi. Stupid that the customer is being punished for this, though. Green Dog Is it clear that this is one of the phones that was bought in bulk from that retailer? From my reading, it was just a resold phone. I mean obviously, it's not happening to all phones, but the fact that it's still happening is a concern. NeverrKnowsBest The IMEIs are being linked to one particular reseller in New Hampshire. celestre Do you have more information than is present in the article on this? NeverrKnowsBest I'm just going off what the article said. I would love to read more, but I highly doubt they are just flipping the switch on every resold Project Fi phone. That just isn't very plausible, at least to my knowledge. datkidpatrick you misunderstood the article... they referenced a time where a bulk reseller's phones were black listed... but now it is happening to a bunch of random sellers that decided to sell the phone... Richard Gao The bulk reseller's phones weren't blacklisted at that time. It is entirely possible that these are the same phones. datkidpatrick i purchased mine straight from project fi... sold it 3 months ago and the seller told me the other day it was blacklisted... and yes my mistake.. the bulk resellers email's were blocked or something like that... Cael Did you pay off the phone before you sold it? datkidpatrick yes i did... Corey Kinard So they're punishing someone that fully paid for a device from you, who fully owned the device? They're legally allowed to just fully break something they've already sold and have no right to? This is worse than when carriers wouldn't unlock phones... datkidpatrick im still giving google the benefit of doubt that it was a mistake... they just need to fix it PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ You'll easily win in small claims court if you have to refund and take the phone back. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ What kind of financing plan did you have? They were first sold in Oct. 22 2016 and this is only May 2017. I seem to remember 24 month financing or 12 month financing. You paid your phone off three months ago and already had sold it on Swappa for some time? datkidpatrick ya youre allowed to pay it off early... PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Maybe that's what caused the error at Fi in blacklisting by accident. datkidpatrick ya that doesn't make any sense... but it got fixed this morning by google... NeverrKnowsBest I see that now. Thanks for the clarification. In any case, there has to be something in common with these blacklisted phones, I don't think Google/Project Fi would blacklist all second hand phones, I don't think that's very plausible. Corey Kinard Do you really need to think straight when you are in competition for largest company in the world? They probably got algorithms looking for shit and those algorithms mess up. 4Ui812 That's pretty shitty Google. David Bowline Is it really? What's shitty is the people buying in bulk just to make an easy buck and therefore screwing people over. Swappa needs to go after these people. jonzey231 Yeah but if I bought a Pixel LAST YEAR and wanted to sell it no in preparation for the next Pixel or the OP5, for example, my customer may get screwed even though it was just an innocent buy and resell. Max Uh? That's not what happened here... so far this situation seems to be the result of a reseller elaborate plan to evade tax and sell the scarce phone for a bigger profit. This wasn't an individual reselling his/her own phone. jonzey231 Uh? I know that it was originally caused by the douche bags in NJ, but now it's affecting regular people. David Bowline No they won't. I'll bet you can call Google and set it up at the time. Use your noggin and quit jumping to conclusions before the fact. jonzey231 But you saying that is also jumping to conclusions, just on the other side of the argument. If you want to argue me, call Google and play it out. Report your findings here. Otherwise, your words mean no more or less than mine. 4Ui812 That's called capitalism. No one is forcing you to buy it. What Google needs to do is fix all the reported issues with that shitty phone. As for the limited supply of said phone , again that's Google's fault (hell , I wouldn't be surprised if Google intentionally limted the supply ... That's a play out of nintys handbook) Duder12 I have a pixel. There is nothing wrong with my phone. I love it. SirCanealot But I have a Pixel and it is broken. Surely this is not possible to exist in reality? :O :O :O David Bowline If Google is selling phones to a specific customer, who then turns around and sells them en masse, how is Google to know what was sold legally and what was stolen? Google has every right to blacklist those phones. Nobody forced anyone to buy a phone from some jerk on swappa. Its the responsibility of the middle man seller to take care of the problem, not Google. This isn't rocket science here. 4Ui812 You're right , it's not rocket science. If the phone is reported as stolen then it's ok to black list the IMEI. This story makes no mention of phones being stolen. Therefore like I said.... That's pretty shitty Google. A Person It may suck, but who is to decide how my money is spent? kbbl Caveat emptor. SeanPR11 Or.... don't buy your phone from a New Jersey Douchebag. If people don't buy from them, they will stop doing this bullshit. It sucks that regular people are caught in the middle (which happens all too often). It seems Swappa should have known these phones were out there (given the business they are in) and flagged them with the IMEI checker. Alex Excuse them for doing whatever they like with a product they purchased. Pfff David Bowline Then Google can assume that they were stolen and blacklist them. It's not Googles fault here. JFC. SeanPR11 Amen. Ryan from GroupTweet Yes, its shitty. If anything Google should go after the reseller, not the innocent legitimate customers that bought the devices and who are now punished because their phones are blacklisted. Alexander Z Great Swappa can't GO after anyone. Maybe suspend/revoke their account but that's it. My trusted seller hasn't been any help at all with the blacklisted pixel I bought. It's so messed up!! T4rd Saw the site/forum owner of a site I frequent get hit with this on his Pixel this week too. Crazy how the Pixel is being plagued with all sorts of extraneous issues. They can't stay in stock, forcing people to buy second hand, then they get black listed because of some weird policy Google has with Project Fi phones. Max Well being out of stock has nothing strange coming from a Google phone, that's been their main issue for a few years now (Nexus), and it happens even to Apple on launch but the difference is that they're a lot better ramping up production afterwards. This blacklisting is really weird, but so far it seems to be potentially related to a shady reseller so we'll have to wait and see if we get more clarification soon. Geoff Johnson As someone from New Hampshire, it's weird to see my state in an AP article, since nothing interesting ever happens here lol. This sucks though because buyers who bought their Pixel 2nd hand months ago now suddenly might get it blacklisted? J.J. Holy f. That is terrible. So random guy buys a second hand pixel (because Google was out of stock) later gets blacklisted by Google/fi. Gets no help from Google. Never buys a Google phone again. Real smart. Green Dog This on top of the seeming shaky quality of the phones may force me to an iPhone. J.J. I feel ya there but, i just can't do the iPhone thing. Loving this s8+ right now. Duder12 When consumers say this its just sad. Why when you have a difficult time with one android manufacturer immediately think its all Androids and switch to the iPhone? This is how Apple gets tons of customers. Everyone that had a bad time with Samsung just assumed their only other option was iPhone bc MARKETING. Green Dog Because I don't want to have to deal with OS updates through the carrier or a limited phone in terms of LTE bands, as is common for Android phones? People like other phones and I've played with some of them, but I like the Pixel/Nexus lines. But this does give me pause. blenderboy Well, the only offering that competes with iPhone in the world of android is the pixel phone. Samsung displays(hardware in general) are great but software experience can't be compared with iPhone or pixel. It is just sad that they can't keep up with Apple or Google. Google is trying really hard to reach there. I am still using Android because of the platforms openness. Duder12 Fair enough but you know what I mean. You are an exception but A LOT of consumers act this way. Honestly I bought my Pixel through the Google Store last fall and its been solid. I love it. Google needs to sort out the second hand market but these are growing pains. Hardware is still new to them bc the nexus line had help from the OEMs. Now they dont. marcusmarcus2 His comment does not address all Androids. He is only speaking of this one phone. It could be he was between using phones by Google and iPhones and he choose to go with Google's phone. Now with this situation, he decided to go to his second choice. I'm not defending switching to an iPhone over another manufacturer, just pointing out his statement you criticized did not say what you thought it was saying and you were the one to actually apply his statement to all Androids. Just playing the devil's advocate here Alex Because when you pay 7-8-900€ (the price of an iPhone) on an Android phone you expect it to be flawless. And that's normal! However, in real life, regardless if you pay 300 or 800€, Android remains Android, with its notoriously inconsistent battery life, inexplicable wakelocks, unfixed bugs (don't get me stored on the "low priority" bugs with thousands of stars), 2 year updates, etc, etc. tekfr33kn That seems a little dramatic considering that iPhones are far from flawless. You also pay that amount for your average laptop and they aren't flawless. It seems you, or someone else, is holding Android phones to an unrealistic standard. Alex Please don't compare a laptop with an Android phone. It makes absolutely no sense. Isn't it rather that manufacturers (Google being the first of them) increase the prices each year to hallucinating levels with little to no innovation or improvement in user experience. Take the S8 line. Beautiful phones, remarkable design, but a fraction of the cost you pay goes to that crap Bixby that nobody wants tekfr33kn I'll agree with you that Google is artificially raising the price far beyond what it should be but that's basic capitalism and market forces. If the market doesn't want those kinds of prices or can't support it, it won't sell. The issue is that people are actually willing to pay that. iPhones are the primary example. There's about $400 - $500 worth of stuff put in a phone that goes for $800 - $1000 and they still sell like hotcakes. I also agree with you about the S8's and Bixby but again, the market says that the S8 is a hot seller and so Samsung isn't about to change that trend. That kind of makes your argument moot. As for comparing a smartphone to a laptop - if you can't see the comparisons, it's either willful ignorance or you just don't know a thing about electronic devices (specifically smartphones or laptops). In either case, I can't help you with that. The fact is that they share more in common that differences. It's one of the many reasons that development strategies (hardware and software) often translate quite well between them. xyz Uhm, because the phone in question is the overpriced Google phone that is intended to compete with the iPhone and which Google fanboys insist is the greatest Android phone of all time. psychic99 It costs about the same to make a Pixel XL as it does an iphone 7, so why would you expect Google to make less margin than Apple? I will say their ecosystem and support SUCKs compared to Apple, so yeah it should be hundred less because the lifecycle experience of a Pixel will be much worse than Apple and the fact that they artificially end support after 2 years is atrocious. I have 4+ year old Nexus that operate just fine on custom ROMs. And BTW I don't think it is worth it either and happily keep my Nexus 6p for less than 50% the cost. I can't rationalize the price they are asking. Google's support is not consistent. Either they will go over the top to help, or tell you go away you are screwed, There is nothing in the middle, and until you engage them you have no idea if you are going to get help or the hand. Yet another reason they should be hundreds less. Merrill Sampson Just FYI, Google announced at IO a few days ago that they're extending the support cycle on the Pixel from 2 year to 5. marcusmarcus2 Do you have a source for that? https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/4457705?hl=en#nexus_devices Android Version updates: October 2018 Security updates: October 2019 Duder12 Dont forget that apple blocked iPhones that had their fingerprint sensor replaced. Also, dont forget Apple is trying to get a bill banned that will allow consumers to have 3rd parties fix phones. PS: My Pixel is fucking awesome. NexusKoolaid "Dont forget that apple blocked iPhones that had their fingerprint sensor replaced." And this in and of itself was a good thing. With the sensor and the CPU being paired, the sudden appearance of a new sensor having a new signature was deemed to be a security breach. I'm not standing up for Apple here, just calling a spade a spade. And I don't know what information Apple could have shared with 3rd party repair houses (if they were inclined to play nice with them) without compromising security. "PS: My Pixel is fucking awesome." I wish I had one. But they were so hard to get hold of for so long that at this point I'll hang on to my 6P until the Pixel2 is out. psychic99 On Android if you reinstall the O/S or make major modifications they simply invalidate the fingerprint then you have to enter the password manually as a failback. Then you can enrol your fingerprint again. In fact every few days you have to manually enter your pin on N to get into the phone. Sounds like a reasonable method, rather than locking the phone forever. Apple went one step farther. You should go watch youtube... Apple is on a mission to make 3rd party repair a thing of the past. They even specifically make it hard to repair. They want control of the supply chain and dispose of equipment as fast as possible. NexusKoolaid On your first point, there is little control over hardware used to support the platform, so core design decisions are prone to fall back to a software solution. Apple on the other hand has tight control of their hardware and have the option for hardware based solutions, whatever the motivation might be, such as better security or to maintain control of their platform (probably a mix on the two). On your second point, I've read the headlines and seen videos on Youtube (like Louis Rossman). Yeah - their crusade against 3rd party repair sickens me to no small degree. Not just because it would prevent me from seeking out more economical and timely repair of my phone (if I had an iPhone), but because this type of precedent could trickle down to other things I might want to tinker with. Jay Hate to say it but that is the risk people run when you don't buy your devices brand new. J.J. True. But they exasperate said risk artificially for the perceived end goal.... More Profit. The truth is they are doing the exact opposite. This news definitely makes me pause on buying a pixel at all. The Second hand market is real and if i have a bad experience do to Google on a second hand device i will probably not buy new from them when i have the funds. james fuston If you (or the person who sells you a phone) violates the terms of service, you're gonna have a bad time regardless of manufacturer. blenderboy Real question to ask, did Apple ever had similar issue with many devices? hunter2 Probably not since Apple realizes that the perceived strong resale value is a determining factor for many people. Even people who may have never sold a product second hand gain some comfort from the knowledge that they could potentially recoup a lot of their costs if they ever needed to sell. ericshmerick Do the TOS say you can never ever resell the device? Serious question. ekana_stone No the TOS is that you resell as soon as you bought it, so like if you bought from fi cuz it's cheaper and the resold it a little under asking. It's only those phones that were black listed ericshmerick What defines "as soon as?" 5 minutes after purchase? 1 week? 2.8 months? 3 years? marcusmarcus2 Do we have confirmation that it is only those phones that were black listed? Could they have inadvertently black listed other phones from fi? EarlyMon The TOS say that commercial resale is not allowed and lots of them were resold by a private company in a scheme that tried to avoid sales tax. Chris Pretty sure that the Supreme Court just ruled that after you purchase the item the first time that you are allowed to resell it. EarlyMon Commercial resale, not individual resale, is the issue here - a gray market supplier. Look at the number of complaints from people who expected Google support and didn't think that it mattered that they were buying what they thought were the Google version only to find out that they were Verizon models. That's one of the things that the store I referred to evidently did. Who mail orders a Pixel from a New Hampshire store to save the cost of taxes added when we all know what the only outlets are? Santos Chavez It actually does say that isn't allowed, hence why they initially banned several accounts the first time. It was a breach of their TOS, and it still is. It's likely Project Fi saw these phones as stolen and blacklisted them. james fuston "You may only purchase Devices for your personal use. You may not commercially resell any Device, but you may give the Device as a gift." So if you purchase the device and resell it in New (unopened) condition, yeah. Fi could also pretty easily make the case that if you purchased the phone and turned around to sell it before the expiry of the original installment plan that you had purchased it with the intention of reselling. MisterAlex That's still not a commercial sale. If I go to the store, buy a Nintendo Switch, and immediately list it as a brand new Switch on Craigslist, I'm not a commercial seller. I'm still an individual selling something that's fully within my "first sale" rights to sell. james fuston Yeah, that's true if you're reading the second, and only the second, sentence there. The first one pretty clearly states "You may only purchase Devices for your personal use" MisterAlex If you think that reselling a personally owned item goes beyond the bounds of personal use, you're kidding yourself (and so is anyone who thinks that line of thinking would hold water, legally speaking). First Sale is a very broad consumer protection, my friend. Once you buy something of your own, you can do whatever you want with it, including sell it. (Edit: in the States, anyway.) james fuston Yep! Totally fine for you to sell it. Also totally fine for Google to deactivate your phone when you've done something you agreed not to do at the time of purchase. It's then legally on you to prove that they overstepped. MisterAlex You're clearly not parsing what I'm posting. Selling privately owned property is within the bounds of "personal use." james fuston Seeing as Google specifically included a clause about gifting, I'd venture to say they disagree with you. MisterAlex That's fine. Sony also disagreed that it had done anything wrong by removing Other OS. james fuston Cool! So we agree that whether or not you believe Google's terms of service to be legal, it's entirely on the customer to take action after being penalized for a violation of said terms of service. MisterAlex It's always up to the wronged party to seek litigation against a wrongdoer. james fuston In that case, I have no idea why you started commenting on legality when I was discussing terms of service violations. Rather, I would have no idea why if this weren't the comment section. MisterAlex A TOS is not a legally binding agreement. You defended enforcement of a TOS when that enforcement went contrary to law. That's why I brought up the comparison to Sony's PS3 lawsuit (which it lost). james fuston I'm not discussing whether terms of service are legally binding. I'm discussing whether or not the action being described (selling the phone) violates the ToS. It does. MisterAlex And my counter was to point out that putting something in a TOS doesn't make it hunky-dory. In fact, it's quite possible for a TOS to violate law. As I've illustrated. bekifft This is where America is so great. Even if the TOS is unenforceable by law, it is technologically enforceable, obviously. So they do it anyway, and now the onus is on you the little guy to get the multinational corporation to knock it off. Vape John most likely carrier issues the blacklisting... so project fi is the culprit psychic99 More profit? The sell them $150 below market rates. That is not free. I don't know what is actually going on but I would suspect that the original owner did something wrong or unethical. To be honest Google's systems are weird. I ported out my nexus5x and it took them almost 3 months to Bill me for the remainder. So maybe the original person cancelled their card, played games with DPP, activated it for one day and did it again. And again. xyz Fortunately, you can just buy an iPhone and get top notch support. hunter2 So the answer is to buy everything new and toss the old device in the landfill? Kind of sad to see how people just roll over and let over-reaching companies basically decimate the second hand market so they can increase their profits. Jay Never said that and you know it. I said this is the risk you take.. It's as simple as that. trixnkix637 That's the risk you take for not buying from reputable sources. Buying used has risks. Sucks he found out the hard way. jb0nez But the article says it's not Google, it's the carrier who blacklisted. Whatever that means... hunter2 That makes no sense. The carrier technically blocks that IMEI on their network, but only after another carrier submits it to the blacklist. It would be like if you SWATTED somebody and then said "it was the police who came to your house with guns not me". pfmiller On top of that this seems like an abuse of the blacklisting system. The system is intended to discourage theft, not as a means for companies to get revenge on their customers. psychic99 That's not true. Companies have been blacklisting devices for years if tos wasn't met. I have bought 3 phones through fi and they are heavily discounted. Google doesn't do that for free they expect you to activate them on fi for more than one day. Also if you are buying a phone from an individual and not a dealer you are taking a risk straight up. I have had friend have their phones blacklisted when they have bought phones from people and then they turned around and reported them as stolen. Swappa is a marketplace not a arbitrator. They are facilitating a sale. You guys need to know the difference. PayPal is your friend. hunter2 That's dumb. The whole point of cancellation fees is to re-coup the cost of subsidies if you break the contract. By going a different route, the only people who are getting punished are the people buying these phones. psychic99 Lots of people don't pay them and I have seen numerous accounts where friends have bought phones and have told me they got a "deal of a lifetime" to find their devices blacklisted and guess what they were people who never paid off their termination fees or have sold them then reported them stolen. And as an individual you need to take responsibility, if you purchase anything through a private transaction you should ask for poof of sale, do they own it, have it put in writing, etc. That way if the seller does something illegal then you have a remedy. This doesn't derisk anything tho. This is good education for people, to know where responsibility lies and the risks of buying from an individual versus an established dealer. In the case of Swappa, you should buy via Paypal, so there is a remedy. You can chargeback your loss if this happens within 6 months (I have done this will unethical sellers), so they are not being punished they are being inconvenienced. But that is the RISK you take buying from an individual. hunter2 I know you want to see Google as the good guy here, but within these comments there are accounts from people who bought outright, and months later sold their Pixel's and now months after that sale are being contacted by the seller about the device being blacklisted. bekifft I think you're missing his point. It's not about Google being the good or bad guy, it's that buying something third party is inherently risky and he's right, you should ask for a chain of evidence that proves the device is legit. Maybe I'm also just tired of people claiming they can find things so cheap online, when most of it is scams like this, and just devalues the whole market. hunter2 You need to look through these comments. There are people here who bought their phones directly from Fi and after switching carriers their fully paid off phones have been blacklisted. They were the original owners and these phones were never sold. There are also people here who bought phones, used them for months, and sold them after they were fully paid off. These people are saying that the proper they sold the phones to are now coming back and telling them they're blacklisted. bekifft In that case that is indeed disturbing. I am a Fi subscriber though I bought my phone direct from the Google store. Sounds like someone made a big mistake on the back end. Lance Biddle I bought my phone from Project Fi, and it has become blacklisted after changing to another carrier. Google is definitely the bad guy right now IMO pfmiller Just because other companies have been doing it, doesn't mean that it's not an abuse of the system. It's clearly not what the blacklisting system was intended for. Lance Biddle How about when you buy the phone from Project Fi, decide to switch carriers and the phone you outright own becomes black listed. I cannot connect to the Verizon service I'm paying for. And Verizon cannot do anything about. And Google/Project Fi isn't. I've wasted way too much time on the phone trying to get this resolved. They have told me it could be 2-5+ days to get it fixed. WTF!! Never Google again. Never. J.J. I'm sorry. That sucks hard. ProductFRED Considering the original seller probably isn't going to pay people back, all Google did was fuck over a bunch of legitimate customers. iPhone reselling is also a big issue, especially on new releases, but you don't see Apple doing this. J.J. Agree 💯. Most of these customers involved (who probably have had hardware and software issues already on top​ of this) will never buy a pixel again! Cassidy James Blaede Just for the record, the majority of Pixel users likely never have hardware or software issues. I, my mom, and a couple of my friends have Pixels and haven't had any issues. You probably hear about issues on Reddit a lot because the only reason to visit the Pixel subreddit is to complain. 🙃 Jordan L no issues here too. J.J. Not a redditer lol, but many other sites show the issues(as low as they may be) and if you were on the fence about spending that kind of money, these stories alone may sway many Duder12 Yep. Just like iphone touch disease and early shutdowns. Tr3ple Never had those issues. xyz That's true. I personally don't know anyone who has been murdered. Therefore, no one gets murdered. Cassidy James Blaede I'd wager that the majority of people don't get murdered. 😉 Written Description My Pixel XL has performed flawlessly since its purchase and it's my first Android phone after using every iPhone from the first generation on. Google's AI is better, its cloud storage is infinitely better, and I don't see going back to Apple anytime soon. J.J. I'm glad you have not had issues.... Others however have Duder12 Not me. Corey Kinard 3rd Np. Duder12 Mines been great... atl3630 great here too. Cael Apple is not a "carrier". ProductFRED Neither is Google. They just use other carriers' networks. Either way, that isn't justification for what they're doing. Unless they plan on replacing everyone's Pixel (which looks like a hard no), they fucked over a lot of legitimate customers. I buy my devices off of swappa most of the time. Tell me how I would get this fixed if neither the seller nor Google want to take responsibility. marcusmarcus2 Google is an MVNO. Per https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-mvno-cell-phone-carrier-578673 "An MVNO is a cell phone carrier (such as a prepaid wireless carrier) that typically does not have its own network infrastructure and licensed radio spectrum" Apple is not even an MVNO carrier. drksilenc fi is a carrier... JD With Fi Google is a Carrier. Mitch Gray This just happened to my fiance's phone. I bought it on swappa for her birthday months ago because Google store didn't have any in stock and this morning it is blacklisted. I'm so furious. I have had every Google phone since the Galaxy Nexus and because of this policy I will never buy another phone of theirs. She is now stranded without a phone and has no way of using it for work at the busiest time of the year for her (she is a teacher and it's graduation week). Who do I contact about this? We shouldn't be punished because someone gamed the system. J.J. I feel so bad for you. I hope you get it resolved. This is an atrocity! J.J. Should definitely hassle fi/Google and let them know if they don't resolve you will never buy and tell everyone you know not to buy and so on jibust No, stop don't tell them that, they might not withstand the shock of loosing them. /S T4rd I would contact the seller of the phone and/or Swappa if they're the service you went through. If they're no help somehow, then contact Paypal if that's how you paid for it. Google isn't going to unblacklist the phone regardless of what you say to them. It's virtually impossible for a phone to be unblacklisted once it has happened, so you're going to have to just get a refund and buy another phone. A Person Good luck with that. I am hesitant to ever buy again from Swappa.. and I used to love, love, love them. I purchased a device that was blatantly not as described. I then contacted Swappa and they instructed me that it is now between me and the seller. So I contacted the seller via the sale page and was basically told: "ummmm, nah". datkidpatrick at that point you could have went thru paypal and filed a claim... T4rd That's why you buy from reputable sellers. The few minor issues I've had on there were resolved quickly. atl3630 yes, same here. To date I've never had a swappa problem that didn't get resolved and the people have been very helpful. Don't blame swappa for shitty sellers. Buy from reputable sellers (like me). yankeesusa Swappa only helps communicating. To resolve any issues you must file a PayPal claim. datkidpatrick contact the seller and see if they can contact project fi/google... King_Android Ijs, BBB is an extremely powerful tool in order to get your voice heard from Corporate asap...... Stephen Hicks If the phone is under warranty still, file an RMA claim and state the bluetooth isn't working correctly on the device and that you've already tried factory resetting the phone as well as reconnected all the bluetooth devices with no improvement. Might work? njn There is no warranty for second hand phones. JRock I purchased a bootlooping 6P off eBay for cheap, erasing/flashing firmware had same result, RMA'd to Huawei and they promptly sent me a brand new one. Mark Depending on the credit card you used to buy the phone, you might have an extended warranty that might cover this. atl3630 You can get your money back. Contact the seller through swappa and tell them the issue. They will likely tell you it's been to long, I don't care, etc. If so, then file a PayPal claim. You have six months PayPal protection. Document that the phone no longer works and send it back to the seller with tracking. Then PayPal will refund you money, no matter what the seller says. M3D1T8R But doing this will just end up screwing over the seller. PayPal will simply take the money from their account and refund it to the buyer. So that's not fair to the seller either. PayPal's "seller protection" is a fraud. And their customer service is a total joke. They should be boycotted. atl3630 How does that screw over the seller? The seller screwed himself when he sold the phone. His beef is with ProjectFi, not the buyer. Frankly the buyer shouldn't have to deal with this crap since buyers have no way to determine the history of a phone. The seller sold a phone that stopped working. That's on them. M3D1T8R Because, obviously, the seller doesn't necessarily know the history and every previous owner of every phone. What if it's a phone someone bought previously used. They used it for a while just fine, and resold it. Then this IMEI block thing happened. atl3630 Yeah, that would suck. But still, it's not the buyer's fault. If something happens and somebody gets cheated out of $500+ then you better bet people are going to exercise whatever option they can to recover their money. PayPal protection would do that for them in the first 6 months. ericshmerick So anyone who sells a phone is on the hook for its functionality until the end of time? GTFO of here with that. It's ridiculous and you know it. atl3630 Six months, moron. PayPal protection is 6 months. Like it or not, facts. Stop being a little bitch. Roh_Mish What if the seller had bought directly from google. AP mentioned about the trains but there doesn't appear to to be a link between this and that fraud. Also there are many cases where buyer on PayPal will request a reverse and never return the product, screwing over the seller. And PayPal won't do anything about this. vn33 That really sucks .. .especially to someone near and dear to you. I would be beyond furious! Hope everything works out!! Duder12 Swappa will cover you here. You are fine. Get the ball rolling. Anwar Imraan Lucas To me it seems that the original buyer had reported his credit card lost or stolen and is disputing charges on his card which in terms maybe blacklisting those devices as stolen.. blindexecutioner You do Google the service of endless beta testing their software on a way overpriced phone and they blacklist you. Nice. Lawrence Good, that is what you get for buying the Bezel XL ericshmerick OH YOUUUU!!1 theadamsegal Yet another reason I will not buy a Google device again. Tiberian For the record: Kyle Bennett is the owner and founder of HardOCP, not just a simple writer for the site. ;) Richard Gao Did not know that. Thanks! datkidpatrick this happened by to me as well... i sold my pixel 3 months ago and the buyer just informed me it was blacklisted... i had no clue project fi was doing this and legit thought the buyer was trying to scam me... i contacted project fi support and was advised it was escalated to be removed from the blacklist... i paid off the phone before i sold it... this is definitely a mistake by google/project fi... they should be correcting this soon... Jordan L Can a carrier just randomly blacklist IMEIs?! I guess so. I was reading this thread thinking 'well, people probably just bought a stolen Pixel unknowingly' but your case proves this wrong. Navneet Suresh Shitty move Google ! :/ Jay If this happened to me, I'd just return the phone to the seller, get refunded, and make them have to deal with this. Swappa made a huge fucking deal about refunding buyers after the Note7 debacle and it should be the same thing here. freshprince_87 I hope that Kyle guy reads your comment. This may help him Jay Honestly, Swappa needs to be pushing this harder. I sold my Note7 last year and despite the fact that the buyer could have gone and gotten the refund from T-Mobile themselves, they chose to take Swappa up on their suggestion of getting the refund from me. (Add to this that Swappa said if I didn't agree to the refund, they'd "suggest" the buyer take the issue up with PayPal as the device was not sold as advertised. Seriously..) datkidpatrick it isn't the sellers fault... and its something that can be fixed... Jay I fail to see how this isn't the seller's fault for trying to game the system and make a profit. This sure as hell isn't Google's fault.. so who do you want to blame then? The unsuspecting buyers? datkidpatrick it is googles fault... the point they referred to in november is completely separate from the issue happening now... the issue happening now is many pixel phones that were sold and originated from fi is getting blacklisted... i sold my pixel after paying it of legit and it just got blacklisted... now please tell me how i tried to game the system... Jay For all I know, you could be one of those shady scalpers too who tried to make a profit by gaming the system. The burden of fixing this issue should still lie on the sellers. If someone wants their money back, they have every right to make you do the legwork of figuring out how you'll make your money back. datkidpatrick I contacted project fi for the buyer and it is escalated... again the point is it wasn't my fault... marcusmarcus2 If you are just trying to sell 1 phone that you got and paid for without trying to "game the system" it is not your fault, but it is your responsibility as the seller to try and resolve the issue, which it sounds like you are doing. Who's fault is it? Hard to tell until Google releases a comment about why this is happening. Did they block these by mistake? Then it is Googles fault. Are they doing it to block the bulk buyers that were "gaming the system" and just went over board and blocked some extra phones that were not part of those that gamed the system? Then it would be the fault of Google and those that gamed the system that caused Google to make the choice. hunter2 I wouldn't say it's his responsibility. He's selling a device. If the maker of that device decides to flip a kill switch in 18 months and disable every device out there then why blame him. Google is flipping a kill switch an all kinds of devices (just below there is a comment from a guy who bought and paid for his phone, then later switched carriers and had his originally bought phone killed). Trying to blame middle men here is crazy. marcusmarcus2 I'm not blaming the seller. Please re-read. I said the fault is with Google if they are the ones that decided to black list them. It is the sellers responsibility to try figure out why a device they sold is blacklisted. If they did nothing wrong, then they should be able to get it unblacklisted by working with Google. From the looks of some of the comments on here, it looks like the buyer would not be able to get the device of the black list but the seller should be able to. Again, I'm not blaming the middle man. There is a difference between fault and responsibility. Fault sounds like it is fully on Google. Responsibility goes across everyone though with some having more responsibility. Buyer has some responsibility to report the issue to the seller instead of just reporting it to paypal. Seller has more responsibility than the seller because they would be the one who would be able to work with Google/fi to get it off the black list. Google/fi would have even more responsibility to explain why devices are being blacklisted and getting devices off the black list if they should not be on there. Max As a somewhat frequent seller/buyer on Swappa and Ebay I can say that this is definitely the sellers responsibility to fix the problem or promptly accept a return for a refund otherwise this isn't so different from a bait and switch situation. datkidpatrick how is it a bait and switch if i paid off a phone legit and decided to sell it after... 3 months later it gets blacklisted... this is a mistake by google and its their responsibility to fix... Max If you paid off the phone legit and didn't do anything shady then it wouldn't have been blacklisted and if it was you, as the original buyer, are the one with more authority to contact Google, not the second hand buyer, therefore it's your responsibility to fix it. The buyer with a blacklisted phone has zero reasons to believe that you were truthful in your description even if you were. datkidpatrick well i did contact project fi for the buyer and it is escalated... Max Then you're doing the right thing (taking responsibility) and hopefully this gets resolved quickly by Fi! Although I don't know if they can just un-blacklist a phone? Hopefully they can. ericshmerick If I buy a product from a retail store and 92 days later it has an issue, guess what they will tell me when I show up barking for a refund? Yeah, pound sand kid. That's what they will say. So why do Swappa sellers suddenly have the responsibility to refund forever ala Costco? I get people are pissy at the situation, but the seller isn't responsible for Google's shadyness here. Max We're not talking about "an issue" here because that's what warranties are for, we're talking about a phone reported as lost/stolen after being sold this could potentially mean a fraudster that didn't fully pay the phone or a thief that sold a stolen phone, I doubt any serious retailer would do that... By the way that's what buyer protections are for, Paypal has six months of protection and credit card providers can be very flexible if you explain your case well and you're in the right. If a retailer pull something like this they would never win a chargeback. Max We're not talking about "an issue" here because that's what warranties are for, we're talking about a phone reported as lost/stolen after being sold this could potentially mean a fraudster that didn't fully pay the phone or a thief that sold a stolen phone, I doubt any serious retailer would do that... By the way that's what buyer protections are for, Paypal has six months of protection and credit card providers can be very flexible if you explain your case well and you're in the right. If a retailer pull something like this they would never win a charge back and the manufacturer and distributor would never be involved in the original transaction or charge back, it would be up to the retailer to go after the manufacturer or distributor. ericshmerick But nothing shady or illegal is going on here. If I and the original buyer and I use it on project fi for two months, then decide to sell it. How does that suddenly implicate me as being some sort of shady criminal? I would simply be selling a legally purchased piece of hardware that was paid in full. Max Can you please elaborate how the buyer knows that you sold "a legally purchased piece of hardware that was paid in full" if he has a blacklisted phone reported as lost/stolen in the hands? Good luck convincing the buyer, Paypal and a Bank that you're in the right in such a situation... Luxferro If they sold you shady (stolen or not legal) products you'd be dealing with them. tnt These are not devices being bought from an official retailer. There's no need to question the history of a device bought from Costco. Swappa (and Ebay and Craigslist for that matter) are not the same type of market. It's the seller's responsibility to know the history (as much as possible anyway) of the devices they're selling. freshprince_87 I guess it's safer to buy a Verizon Google Pixel instead if you intend on reselling it later. So the future buyer isn't screwed by Google. That is such a ridiculous policy drksilenc have to have a line with verizon to do that though. Wendell Brown Apparently not, this dude says his WERE Verizon phones that were locked.... https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/6d2yse/2_of_my_3_google_pixel_phones_blacklisted_on_the/ Me Google is just shooting themselves in the foot at this point with the Pixel Yan Qin I just sold my Pixel XL and switch to Galaxy S8, I do think I was out of my mind that I actually bought Pixel at full price. Jordan L anyone resell a project fi phone NOT through Swappa and have it blacklisted? maybe ProjectFi blacklisted only Swappa phones(still a strange move if it was on purpose) Jagermeister 2 of my 3 Pixel phones showed up blacklisted 2 days ago. I made a reddit post yesterday of my issue. I though it was part of an insurance fraud scam. https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/6d2yse/2_of_my_3_google_pixel_phones_blacklisted_on_the/ I had originally though our phones were from Verizon not Google Fi. We were happy Pixel customers that are now considering purchasing different phones because Google can report as stolen whenever they feel a Google Fi device was not transferred to a new owner per their TOS. How can any user purchasing a pre-owned or "new" Google Pixel be sure that it isn't a Google Fi device and won't be blacklisted in the future? Max Johnson Note to self, don't buy second hand Google devices. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Note to everyone: Don't buy first hand Google devices. Max Why? Mine works perfectly fine and so far it's the best phone I've ever owned. Dana Yeah, it's fine as long as you don't get it from Project Fi because you can't sell it if you want to upgrade to a new device. Max LOL, what? I simply bought it directly from store.google.com, no issues here and I can provide proof. This is something related to phones sold through Fi. hunter2 Congrats, scroll up one comment and you'll find a guy who's phone is blacklisted despite him being the original owner and being fully paid off. To answer your question of "Why", it's because not everyone is as comfortable gambling with their money as you are. Max 1) It was blacklisted by the carrier, not the manufacturer. 2) It was blacklisted after it was resold, sucks but as far as we know it doesn't affect the original seller, there's a difference there. 3) We don't know yet why this really happened. 4) Even with all of the above, I don't see how it fits in a "Don't buy first hand Google devices." statement. Maybe if you tell me "Don't deal with Project Fi service" I could somewhat agree. hunter2 http://disq.us/p/1iz7ts3 Sorry, should have permalinked the comment since the order is moving per votes. That guy was the original owner and claims to have been paid off. Moved to Verizon at some point and had the device he originally bough directly from Google blacklisted. Max Well that negates my point 2 and sucks even more. But still the blame here points 100% to Project Fi and not the phone itself nor Google as the manufacturer of the phone. Something really strange is happening with Project Fi devices and hopefully they will find out soon if it's an error, incompetence, sabotage or maybe even hacking. hunter2 I guess it depends on how willing you are to absolve the parent company of things a specific branch is doing. It would be like saying "don't blame MS, it's the IE team who makes the browser" during the IE6 days. Max Legally is evident that the responsibility is on Google but if you think that the group in charge of designing and manufacturing the Pixel has any minimal clue about what happens inside the group of the MVNO Project Fi then you're frankly clueless about how such a huge company works. By the way IE and Edge sucks but Visual Studio rocks and I'm liking more Windows 10 recently but I guess I should avoid using everything Microsoft because IE really sucks, right? hunter2 If a decisions like these can be made without going far enough up the chain of command that you're dealing with some higher ups, then I don't really want to know how this company runs. It's enough to tell me that I can't really trust them because you can't really depend on a company keeping in line with their corporate ideals when individual units can work with this much impunity. Avoiding/disliking MS was never about IE sucking. It was about IE being openly hostile and damaging to the web. This complaint was obviously projected at Microsoft themselves since no one believed that the IE team was working in a bubble. I don't know how old you are so maybe you weren't around when all this was going on. It's not about disliking a company because one or some of their many products are inferior. It's about disliking them because they employ user hostile tactics and you don't feel like you can support that (or at the very least want to punish them in the tiny way you can by voting with your wallet). Max So you already got an official response from Google about this? Can you share it? Because so far I have only read guesses about what is happening and nothing official yet. I'm old enough to have used MS-DOS 5 & 6 as well as Windows 3.1. That doesn't change the fact that saying "don't buy anything from a company" based on one division issues is just silly. If Google officially says that all of this was planned then maybe you could have a point, until then you're just stretching facts to prove a weak point. hunter2 I don't need to fill in the facts. I'm saying either way it's bad. The facts are that this happened. Additional facts about why it happened are irrelevant Max Well, if you're happy thinking like that be my guest, I guess some people is unable to see the colors and think the world is black and white. hunter2 For people whom this isn't a mundane thought experiment but are actually in a position where they need to buy a new device (not everyone is able to be without their phone until Google ultimately resolves this); the shades of gray in this scenario don't change their circumstances. The facts are that they have a phone that was remotely disabled. I'm assuming your shades of gray are the how's and why's of that? How is that of any consequence to these people? Steve_Jobroni Shut up, troll. DanSan got em! Matt This will be great for their resale value. ericshmerick Swappa comments: I GEEVE U $200 BUY NOW FINAL OFFERS!! JD Wooooo! Go Pixel, I'm definately not going near any Google hardware with a 1000ft pole now.I may use my 1001ft pole. In Many states, and at least in Canada this is not legal, you can't blacklist a phone for ToS violation. There's a very narrow list of reasons for a device to be blacklisted. Cuong This is a really shitty move from Google. At least sent a notification few days in advance and offer a way to appeal. What if a person was in an emergency situation? Imagine the lawsuit for that, Google. Why customers have to suffer because Google can't control their resellers? ericshmerick 911 always works. segag Thats Fuck all! Snowsky Mountain This may seriously make me rethink my use of Google hardware (especially phones). Stevie Do no evil Google. Do no evil. My Dixie Wrecked Yeah, they got rid of that mandate years ago. Seriously. Look it up. mxwp lol, yeah it was pretty funny. but i give Big G props for being somewhat honest about that. "hmm, we're huge now and so just cannot help to do some evil" Corey Kinard Just looked​ it up. Looks like it's still in place for Google. Alphabet's is different l though. It's "do the right thing." Sruly J Bought an unlocked Pixel yesterday for $334. Before I send it in to get checked and fixed by Google, I really should check the IMEI (normally I'd have the IMEI first, but the seller didn't give it to me). Michael D’Ambrosio "Someone with an answer." That'll get you far with Tech support. Smh vn33 Does the blacklisted phone works out of US, say in Canada? I assume yes, if it's the carriers that are doing the blacklisting. that said, it would really dampen my desire for a phone from Google. Stevie I am crossing my fingers that they don't come after my Nexus 6. Already bought and activated. There's no going back right? speedy1979 So to clarify google is randomly blacklisting any google pixel that is resold. I actually considered buying a ProjectFi device sometime ago; so glad I didn't go through with it. Kris Crowley I have fi service. When you buy a phone through fi you got a discount or a phone that you can't get through the Google store if you want. There is a disclaimer that if you buy it and never activate it that you will be charged additional Monies within 30 days. Now without knowing isn't possible that A the phone was bought at a discount and B the additional fee was levied but never paid? trixnkix637 Know the risks of buying used people. Do your homework. Asking where the seller bought the phone originally could've prevented all of this. Can't blame Google because someone tried to game the system both ways. marcusmarcus2 Know the risks of not using commas, people. You should never buy people, whether they are used or new. Rony Hmmm, is there a difference between a new and a used person. I've scoured the forums and haven't got a clear answer. marcusmarcus2 You would have to ask them before you buy them. They usually know when they've been used. But again, you should not buy any people. Def Ref But if you try to rent people, you start hearing words like "solicitation" and that's no fun. marcusmarcus2 Don't rent them either. While we are at it. Do not borrow, loan or steal people. Def Ref Is enticement allowed in your no fun world? Asking for a friend. marcusmarcus2 I don't see a problem with enticement as long as that enticement does not lead to stealing people. "No fun world"? You mean my world where I think people should not be viewed or treated as items/property? If yes, then yeah, I guess it is a no fun world. Def Ref Lighten up, Francis. marcusmarcus2 Lighten up, Francis? https://38.media.tumblr.com/39ef7347a58e308e67a5bd01cd124431/tumblr_nsld6lafvE1qh124lo1_500.gif Def Ref https://youtu.be/0OnpkDWbeJs That the title is misspelled AND mispunctuated is bonus. trixnkix637 Didn't NY and NV allow for the renting of people or is that wishful thinking? Asking for a friend. Rod This was so good, I had to sign into Disqus to upvote. trixnkix637 Buying people has been around for ages. Can't just stop now because of commas. marcusmarcus2 Buying used has been around for ages. trixnkix637 And so has it's risks. ericshmerick Wow I feel bad for the Swappa sellers who are getting PayPal charge backs right about now. Alexander Z Great This was the response I received. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/948da6656e25823e8dc529c4571fbc2d347f5e820ee9b7c91844d48c9745a112.png DanSan owner of the device ≠ person who purchased. way to go google. InnocentEd News flash this could happen with any phone from any manufacturer on any network that is resold used. I've had it happen with 2 iPhones and Apple could have cared less. You buy used, you take the risk. It's amazing how even credited tech journalists assume devices on Swappa are always going to be 100% safe. If Project Fi were not allowed to be resold via T&S then it's no diff than blacklisting a resold stolen phone...they had every right. Bewear This is why we can't have nice things. Rony Honestly this makes total sense. Its technically stealing the phone if you buy it for a discounted price and you dont activate it and sell it again. I think they made the right move. raffr It's not "technically" stealing. If you purchase a product at the price requested, you did not steal it. IF, big IF, in your purchase agreement it states you cannot resell the phone without activating it first, then google has a case. Serge Cebrian if you are paying for the service ... you are still paying for it even if you keep your older phone or a better phone if you want to unless you stop paying then its stealing ... but not if you keep the service// marcusmarcus2 They could have blacklisted these phones for that reason. But they could have also been overzealous when blacklisting devices and blacklisted numerous other devices that people did not do that with. It may have been the right move to block those that did do that, but if they inadvertently blocked additional devices, then hopefully they make the right move and unblock those devices that should not have been blocked. newtonfb Not new. Wife got a 5x on swappa. Phone was originally on FI but never taken off the account. We tried to activate it on FI but they did we couldn't until the owner released the phone? It worked fine on any other carrier. Had to get a new 5x Lance Biddle I paid off my pixel through project fi. I recently switched to Verizon. Yesterday Verizon notified me that my phone had been reported as stolen! When I awoke this morning my service had been disabled by Verizon. The support from Project Fi has been abysmal. What do I do to fix this? Corey Kinard Go to Reddit. Get ready for talks with the Better Business Bureau. Keep contacting Fi, keep screenshotting all the correspondences, you get all the buyers info in order to prove you are the original device owner. You don't fix this, you didn't cause it to break. Google fixes this. Everyone affected just has to light a fire under their ass. tnt Keep pushing / escalating with Project Fi. Ryan from GroupTweet I bought a Pixel from Tradeport USA (NH based company, shit!) about 3 months ago. The phone is on T-mobile right now and still currently working (fingers crossed). From my interpretation this appears only to be affecting Pixels bought through Google Fi - and perhaps not ones bought via Google Play store unlocked? Is that correct? Is there anyway I can check to see if my pixel was in fact sold via Google FI vs Google Play? Really hoping I don't wake up to a bricked phone in the next couple mornings... Sruly J You could contact Google, provide them with the IMEI, and they could let you know if it was bought through Google Play. Ryan from GroupTweet Thanks - but don't want to risk tipping them off that my phone should be on the blacklist :( Sruly J But wouldn't they know anyways if it should be blacklisted? I mean, how else would they have blacklisted so many phones this week? lauriedesautels So I have the Pixel and was planning on selling it via Swappa after my credits end from another phone. They ended up giving me a brand new Pixel XL but their service has become horrible where I live. So please correct me if I am wrong but if the Pixel is paid off and I switch carriers/ my Pixel is a paperweight? (I don't plan on using the phone on another carrier after 3 mo). ericshmerick According to this place, you can never sell it. You must carry it with you to your grave. Robert Montoya I have a Pixel that is currently blacklisted as of 5/23/2017 I bought it from Swappa... Google says they will lift the ban in 24 to 48 hours... That was 24 hours ago.. Phone still Blacklisted Wendell Brown I must have missed where it was shown that these deactivated phones were on Project Fi. As best I can tell, the only link to Fi is from an OLD article about the guy reselling phones several months ago. Is there any proof that this is in any way Fi related? MadJoe I have to say, if Google ever blacklisted my phone in a misguided sour-grapes attempt to punish the person who sold it to me, and without compensating me for it I would be rather angry. It would also be the absolute last Google product I ever purchased. As it is, this story has me glad I don't own anything more than a $25 Chromecast that I never use. I was seriously considering the Pixel 2 as my next phone, but not any more. If they were going to be such babies about the phones being resold, they should have vetted their buyers a little better. Corey Kinard It doesn't look like they were making any money off of you in the first place... Second-hand buyers/ bargain hunters rarely go out and pre-order $800 phones. Maybe you're different. They're definitely fucking up, but considering how little the pixel one sold and how much money they make I'm not sure they'll care about this any which way the wind blows. Same way Apple can just outright tell their customers to go fuck themselves over certain problems. MadJoe The problem is that too many people will ignore a company's unscrupulous behavior. If more of us would punished them by taking away access to our wallets, they'd think twice about trying to screw us. But people are lazy and lack commitment. So you're absolutely right, Google won't feel any hit by my deciding not to buy any more of their shit because a shit-ton of blind lemmings will gladly line up to jump off that spot on the cliff I chose not to use. And when a couple of them get screwed, they will cry "why isn't anyone else interested in helping me?" as the rest of the heard ignore them. On the bright side, the cycle will continue ad nauseum until I'm in a hole in the ground. Bruce Considering the ridiculous amount they are charging for the phones (Apple pricing without the Apple level support), this just about kills the resale value for a Pixel. Who the hell is going to buy a used phone for $500+ (because the original cost is so high) if their phones get blacklisted months later. And who the hell is going to buy the phones at the original price, when resale value will drop like a rock. And this doesn't even take into account all the BS that comes with the phone to begin with. 2 years of guaranteed OS updates. Hardware issues (Bluetooth, speakers, water resistance...) which don't get acknowledged amid finger pointing. Insufficient inventory even if they were open to replacements. The 128GB version (the 32GB is too little and the 64 GB doesn't exist) costs almost a $1000. The first time they tried this with the Nexus One, it didn't go well. This doesn't seem to be going much better. The Galaxy Nexus couldn't be upgraded because of drivers. The only real hits have been the Nexus 5 and the 6P. UniBroW *clutches iPhone 7 plus despite it's inferiority to android* Tj Hariharan Wait, do we actually KNOW that the phones that are blacklisted were originally purchased for reselling for profit? All i got from this article was that the phone was originally purchased from Project Fi.. RTNDO128 My phone was effected by this. I've been having issues with no T-Mobile service for the past couple of days on Project Fi. After reading this article, I used the Swappa IMEI checker and what do you know, my phone is reported "lost/stolen". I bought my Pixel on eBay at the beginning of January. Now I'm beyond their 30 day gaurentee. What an absolute clusterfuck. RTNDO128 My phone was effected by this. I've been having issues with no T-Mobile service for the past couple of days on Project Fi. After reading this article, I used the Swappa IMEI checker and what do you know, my phone is reported "lost/stolen". I bought my Pixel on eBay in the middle of February. Now I'm beyond their 30 day guarantee. What an absolute clusterfuck. Y2J You have 180 days in Paypal. RTNDO128 Thanks, I filed a claim with them. Hopefully this situation is covered. Max Did you contact first the seller? Otherwise it's a dick move to file a claim without first giving the seller the opportunity to see if he collaborates... RTNDO128 Thanks for your opinion. As stated, I'm beyond the 30 day eBay guarantee window. I created a "dispute" through the PayPal Resolution Center, which sends a message directly to the seller. PayPal is totally uninvolved with the dispute until I choose to escalate, which will only happen if I cannot get this resolved with the seller first. I just want to have our conversations documented in the event that the seller does not want to deal with this situation. Ken Kinda weird Google said that IMEI can't be blocked by manufacturer, I'm sure that's true. But what when manufacturer is also technically the carrier? Da_James Are you saying that "buying" a device in the USA doesn't mean you own it? Just SUE. Steve_Jobroni > as it's the carrier and not the manufacturer that has the ability to blacklist devices Do people not read the full article anymore? There seems to be a lot of Jabroni's blaming Google when it's the carrier that can only do the blacklisting. Sir_Brizz But that carrier is Project Fi, aka Google... Aleksandr Ivanov Change IMEI, problem solved! AbdulB1 lol Cassidy James Blaede I'd be interested in hearing how widespread this actually is, and a response from Google. My mom bought a Pixel from Swappa because Google was out of stock, and she's been loving it. I'd hate for her phone to become a brick because of this. Leonardo Baez I see a class action demand on the horizon? Đức Thành I'm a die-hard Google fan, but wow does Google need some fixing. justmy2pennies2012 There is one simple way Google can prevent the second hand market from making a profit. 1. Provide enough stock for all those who want to purchase the device! :) Bonus: Price the device accrodingly!! I gave up trying to buy one new from VZW and the Play Store. MisterAlex Did getting a Pixel phone through Fi require signing away your rights regarding "first sale?" And is that enforceable? RayNeverLearns You are Android Police. You might want to stay more up to date on this story and keep your readers updated, especially one that has a big impact on one of the purest Android flagships. http://www.techspot.com/news/69452-pixel-phones-project-fi-showing-up-blacklisted.html datkidpatrick happy to announce the phone i sold has been taken off the blacklist after communicating with project fi... so if you're affected by this contact google or more specifically project fi support... RayNeverLearns I believe Project Fi has done this for all affected Pixels. I didn't contact the person who sold it to me (Craigslist 7 months ago... wouldn't know where to even start) yet my phone was whitelisted earlier today. A little pain and it took almost 3 days, but a good resolution. datkidpatrick thats great... happy it's fixed... Amir What an idiotic move by Google. That's suicide. HardWired I wonder how long before Tesla implement a similar system in their cars :) Sorry you signed an agreement, the car has been disabled because you decided to sell it to a used car salesman for resale.

Opinion: Even if you can, you probably shouldn't buy a Google Pixel anymore David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/05/01 2:09pm PDTMay 1, 2017 111 Plus 1 on G+ 379 Share on Facebook 108 Share on Twitter Total Shares598 Editorials Pixel Pixel XL The Google Pixel is a notoriously hard phone to get a hold of. Persistent stock issues have plagued Google's first "in-house" handset from day one, and things really are little to no better six months after the launch event. Honestly, it's a bit embarrassing just how consistently incompetent Google seems to be at keeping a reasonable inventory of phones available for purchase. But setting that aside, as one of the Pixel's most ardent evangelists, I think there's something it's probably time for me to come clean on: Even if you could buy a Pixel today, I really think you shouldn't. The Pixel is a product with generation-one product issues. The Bluetooth performance is horrid. It's not waterproof. The bezels really are due for a shrink. I don't think the exterior coating on the black and blue variants is of a particularly high quality. The glass window gets scuffed up incredibly easily. The Snapdragon 821 is officially old news. And it doesn't support proper advanced network features across all four of the big US carriers. There are other flaws I could point to, and while none of them are too terrible, they do speak to the slightly-rushed development cycle this phone seems to have been subjected to. Sure, Google got some things astoundingly right: the performance, the camera, the larger software experience. In fact, I think the Pixel is easily the best Android smartphone ever for these strengths, at least if we're talking about me personally as a user (your mileage, obviously, may vary). But for all the great, smooth, fast, clean, pure, simple, natural, and various other adjective-members singing in the Pixel-praise cavalcade, this phone is not the one to buy right now. For starters, Google continues to ask what is an increasingly laughable amount of money for the model most of us want - the 128GB XL - at a staggering $870. Sure, Apple charges the same for an iPhone 7 Plus 128GB, but I'm under no illusion that this comparison in any way favors Google. The iPhone comes with Apple customer service (with actual stores), a longer software support period going forward, and runs no real risk of poor resale value. The Pixel? Google's online support is iffy at best, we know the phone will be unsupported by October 2018, and I have a strong feeling generation-one Pixel resale values will drop like a rock once the new phones are announced. And that really is why, if you haven't pulled the trigger on a Pixel yet, you should just wait. It's overpriced, under-supported, and competing phones like the Galaxy S8 offer a whole lot more technology for your money. The Galaxy S8+ is $20 less than a 128GB Pixel XL, and I would argue it is far and away the better smartphone value. That amazing display, brand-new Snapdragon 835 processor, jaw-dropping design and packaging, and the full support of all our American carriers' latest LTE advancements could each be a reason on its own to put the Galaxy S8 above Google's smartphone. Do I still prefer using the Pixel over the S8? Sure. But I wouldn't buy a 128GB Pixel XL over a Galaxy S8+ today. That would be, frankly, a bit silly. If Google was asking $670 and not $870, the discussion would probably change, but they aren't. You've got to pay full price, and there's no way I could recommend anyone do that. If you're still on the fence about the Pixel, let me try to push you over: wait for the next generation. I realize that this sort of thinking can devolve into a rationale that encourages you to never upgrade anything because something newer, faster, and better is constantly on the horizon. But in this case, I think it's a consideration that is worth weighing more seriously than usual. Many of the Pixel's biggest flaws relate to Google's inexperience producing a smartphone. Issues that only come up as you try to mass-produce and distribute a product with a real marketing campaign that creates real demand, and the phone gets into the hands of "real" users who aren't part of the now-derailed Nexus phone hypetrain. Inside Google, expectations were no doubt managed, realities realized, and priorities accordingly re-calibrated after this first launch. (Side note: if the Bluetooth performance on the next Pixel is as bad as the first one, I may scream, Google.) Meanwhile, the things that make the Pixel great aren't going anywhere. The next Pixel will be fast, it will take great photos, and it will offer a wonderfully unfettered Android experience. Those that make it less than great? Google is no doubt drilling down through the worst of them in order to ensure the Pixel 2 - or whatever it's called - won't make the same mistakes that the original did (waterproofing, please). And one of the primary reasons to try the Pixel in the first place - to be on the very bleeding edge - really only remains true from a software standpoint. Older phones like the Nexus 5X and 6P don't even let the Pixel have an advantage there, as they're on the same update track until around the time the next Pixel phones launch. If you absolutely need a smartphone soon and the Pixel is tempting you, ask yourself this: Can you deal with a Moto G5 Plus for six months if it means having a better Pixel down the road? While as a reviewer I have the admitted luxury of not needing to consider such things, were I in such a position, I'd have little in the way of a counterargument to offer. Sure, you'll take a resale hit on anything you buy now, but the Pixel is going to face a much, much steeper devaluation curve in that time than any budget phone. Buying a Pixel right now just doesn't make sense. I love my Pixel XL, but I'm officially done recommending the phone to friends and relatives. Instead, I'll tell them to wait, or to get the Galaxy S8 they were probably going to buy anyway. Tags editorial google pixel google pixel xl opinion pixel xl subscribe ...

What's wrong with it? I haven't really noticed issues on my 128 non XL. I still love my phone but I understand if someone was switching now, they should just wait for the new one. I probably will. Patruns The XL is too large for me. No wireless charging is a game stopper for me. $650+ is just too much to pay as I buy my phones outright for my wife and myself. We are still happily using our Nexus 5 phones until something of roughly the same dimensions with QI charging comes out that won't break the bank. Also, I want pure Android. Not interested in Touchwiz or any other skins. Rod So, I found another proud N5 owner! I'm in my third battery, nothing to complain about. YuCMi I skipped this generation, was too salty about Google's treatment of Nexus devices. If they make their next phone reasonably priced, then I'll consider it. Otherwise, Google can fuck off with their "premium" pricing. CW The OnePlus 3T is a great phone at a great price! Laura J. Sellers Hughes I bought my Google Pixel XL for the camera. I have not been disappointed! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/c44fd1bc546c27c02f945b075e0388e076c62e0fd612b3c74442129a05446139.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/c4618b9d22a1d44186f347c184038b3a833f38a1148cc4b91b95981303fa8b6b.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/465d23a781688e73e20a0737904c3880ee693ee06b5dd1779ae91d9799b0488b.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/1f3d76182fdd59b34eda695d20943d03e71240b775f63106ef41809601a7cabf.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/66175dfb8d6503940dc945b8d865f4f8276c84f7f3abd0e0e46dc31136501275.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f7fa8ed860bc28a3a3e377a7e74591e764bdec5795747c4a1afb93eaa44aa0b2.jpg Rod You shouldn't. It's the best camera in a smartphone currently. Even the S8 was left behind in image quality. Aj Wayans Nothing wrong with my Pixel, best phone I've ever had. Only has scratches because I've dropped it a few times Rod Impossible. Pixel is horrid, every single owner has an urge to throw it onto the nearest wall. WNDRKND I hear ya, but I got pixel for Christmas. And back then, there was no new Samsung phone. Personally, the optimization alone makes the phone worth it... Like, I've literally had no problems. Even the speaker issue, Bluetooth, whatever. My handset works perfect, even for a first generation device. Either way, I'll be waiting for pixel three and skipping pixel 2 this Christmas. Rod I think you're 4 months late. Lol WNDRKND Haha perhaps, but with nobody able to get one... I still feel 9 months early lmao! Rod First rule of the Pixel club: no one talks about the club Hussain Ahmadi Pixel is an indie phone, like indie films with limited screens and very much less public appeal, no matter how good it is it will always be just a side phone. The only true big sharks in the market are Samsung and Apple. Google is not able to compete with them erikz The main reason I wanted the Pixel was to get on Google Fi. ackthbbft I think there are still good reasons to go with the Pixel, even if it means waiting for gen 2. I went with the Pixel because I wanted to get on Project Fi and "pure" Android. As a former Samsung Galaxy S5 user (S2 before that), I got tired of both carrier-installed and OEM bloatware, plus I've been saving money on my plan. Tj Hariharan Frankly I'm considering an LG-G6... comes with assistant, near stock android from what I've been told and my little experience with in-store demo's...AND iirc: an SD Card. Rod Then, when Google drops Android 8, you'll infuriated asking LG where your OTA is. gparmar76 Google will charge the same price with Pixel 2. They have a proven track record with the Nexus phones... roseglace >The Bluetooth performance is horrid. so? bluetooth is not everything to everyone. in particular, i've used it on my pixel exactly once. a non-issue. > It's not waterproof. i'll remember not to take my phone into the shower. another non-issue. > The bezels really are due for a shrink. the bezels i can't see with the phone in its case? > I don't think the exterior coating on the black and blue variants is of a >particularly high quality. the coating i can't see with the phone in its case? > The glass window gets scuffed up incredibly easily. there's that case in the way again. darn. > And it doesn't support proper advanced network features across all four >of the big US carriers. such as? maybe i'd worry if i lived in the united states but i bought the phone for phone calls, SMS and wifi. are those 'advanced'? they work in canada. > the model most of us want - the 128GB XL is there a shred of evidence that 'most' of 'us' want it? if it was the exact same price as the 16GB version i'd want it. if it was even twenty bucks more? umm, probably not. i know it's labelled 'opinion' and everything, but could you try a _little_ harder not to sound like you're whining? John Pitkethly I got a Pixel in December and have none of the problems listed in this article. Jordan Bartholme Great article, thank you! thereasoner If fast updates and performance are your thing than it's never a bad time to buy a Pixel but if one must wait then I guess the Pixel 2 is not that far off. Don't care about stock Android performance and updates? Then there are more choices coming still besides Samsung. I personally am looking forward to the HTC U 11 in a couple of weeks time. geolemon Good points. Even still, the worst point is that it's a metal (stupid) and glass (downright silly) wannabe iPhone (including all the hardware limitations we all hate Apple for) to try to pull the "Apple demographic" stereotype as a customer - people who want a jewelry phone rather than a functional, practical tool. Sadly, few alternatives exist today, if you want high end specs. How far we've fallen in just a few years. Hopefully it's something to just ride out - high end phones that fit in front trouser pockets and have swappable batteries, sd cards, and the durability of polycarbonate replacing the impact vulnerability of metal will reappear. But certainly - the Pixel is one of the more vulgar offerings. Sad, because I was otherwise a satisfied customer on Google Fi. Mike Dealbreaker on the Pixel 2 could be whether or not Google include unlimited full resolution Photos & Video BackUp like they have with the Pixel 1. If they don't & just throw in something like the S8's increased 100K Play Music songs limit instead, we just might hold on to our Pixel XL 128 a little longer instead. Like all hardware, it's what you do with it that really matters, but without the software to achieve it with... You just pays your money & you takes your choice. Notpoliticalyet Mate 9 is my Pixel XL. Easy to get one and top end specs. I have had all the Nexus phones and passed up the Pixel. I may look at the 2nd generation but they need to fix their supply chain. No reason to wait long with all of the good competition out there. They also created hype with limited availability. Get it right Google. Kimwo Good read! I've HATED my Pixel from day one! I tried to fall in love with it but I haven't! My husband made me do an upgrade and of course it was when this dumb a*$ ph came out! I sent my Samsung GalaxyS5 in as was required for rebate to get the Pixel. The camera sucks butt, I don't know what all the hype was about! I thought I'd like the fact it has unlimited storage but how is that useful if you can't get a good quality photo!!!! I think Androids are way better, and easy to use. That's all I've had sense the iPhone 4! Wouldn't go back to an iPhone but would take it over a Pixel any day!!😝 Christopher Hopkins First off who ever made this post is just a glorified iPhone fan and downing the Google pixel I've had mine since launch and so have the 3 others on my account and all of us can say nothing has gone wrong with my pixel not once so get off your high horse and the back glass part of my phone is not scratched still and this is the same phone since launch same with my GF her brother and my best friend on my account Stanced Imports What a joke review I've had a Google pixel since January this phone is the best phone I've ever had, and I've had a iPhone 7😂 if you can't afford it that's not a reason to not buy it, that's a choice the consumer should make not a reflection on the phones performance 😁 I live in Canada so my Google pixel is about 1000$ and it's worth every penny Stanced Imports Also I find it's nice that the phones availability is scarce so I don't look at everyone and they all have the same phone. vitriolix "unsupported by October 2018" That's wrong, they will still get security patches until Oct 2019. Still too short, but let's not warp the facts MikeOxlong Nobody cares what Ruddock thinks. Sorry. Makikiguy Nexus 5 is my first smart phone and I ain't changing. Go overseas, three clicks and you are good to go. No sims, no overseas carriers, no nothing.

Google Phone v10 enables post-call messages for failed calls, prepares for enhanced incoming calls on RCS and voicemail backup [APK Teardown + Download] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/05/23 1:19pm PDTMay 23, 2017 61 Plus 1 on G+ 111 Share on Facebook 54 Share on Twitter Total Shares226 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Article Contents 1 What's New 1.1 Post-call messages 2 Teardown 2.1 RCS Calling 2.2 Voicemail Backup 3 Download With the dust settling after the deluge caused by I/O 2017, it's time to take a closer look at some of the many other things that came with out last week. Some interesting changes came with a brand new version of the Google Phone app included with Android O Developer Preview 2. There's a new prompt suggesting users send a message after a call fails to connect. A deep dive into the apk also turned up signs that Google is working on new RCS calling features and preparing some kind of backup option for voicemail. What's New Unofficial Changelog: (the stuff we found) Post-call messaging Post-call messages Earlier this month, a teardown of of v9 provided a good hint that the Phone app would begin showing suggestions for messages to send after completing a call. With v10, that feature is now live, but not quite as functional as previously expected. Left: snackbar prompt. Right: new message screen. The post-call messaging feature appears as a snackbar prompt asking why you called, to which you can send a message. The prompt only appears after attempting a call that fails without making a connection. To be specific, the prompt won't show up if you hang up, a voicemail service answers, or anything else occurs that would be considered a connection. Basically, if you hear a sound indicating the other end is ringing, any outcome from that point on is probably not going to trigger the prompt. You're most likely to see this prompt in an area where cellular reception isn't good enough to establish a voice call, but you can also force it to show up by trying to make a call while airplane mode is active. Otherwise, it's probably not going to turn up anywhere else. If you opt to send a message, you'll be taken to a screen with a message box and three pre-written messages with different levels of urgency. Tapping a message will put it into the textbox below, but you can continue to make edits before sending. The exact text of the prompt seems to be a mismatch for the current functionality, which left us wondering if this feature is also intended to work in other scenarios like when the call is redirected to voicemail or disconnects within a second of being picked up. Perhaps this is just the first step and other use cases will be handled in the future. In the meantime, this actually might be handy if you're in the middle of nowhere and staring at a single signal bar with no hope of making a call. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. RCS Calling It's no secret that Google is working to add fairly extensive RCS support to both its Phone app and Android Messages. Now it's just a matter of which features are going to be added and when we'll get to use some of them. This update to the Phone app gives us a bit more insight into some new rich calling features that we'll soon have at our disposal. A stack of new notification strings reveal that Google's developers are currently working on supporting incoming calls with additional data. At this time, it's clear calls can include a location, photo, message, or any combination of those. One line also mentions "attachments," which may suggest other types of data are supported, but not necessarily known in advance. This would make sense for things like URLs or specially crafted data packets can be handed off between other apps. It's also worth noting that these strings are split up for regular and "important" calls, which lines up with the commonly known feature allowing callers to indicate a degree of urgency. code <string name="important_notification_incoming_call_attachments">Important incoming call with attachments</string> <string name="important_notification_incoming_call_with_location">Important incoming call with location</string> <string name="important_notification_incoming_call_with_message">Important incoming call with message</string> <string name="important_notification_incoming_call_with_message_location">Important incoming call with message and location</string> <string name="important_notification_incoming_call_with_photo">Important incoming call with photo</string> <string name="important_notification_incoming_call_with_photo_location">Important incoming call with photo and location</string> <string name="important_notification_incoming_call_with_photo_message">Important incoming call with photo and message</string> <string name="important_notification_incoming_call_with_photo_message_location">Important incoming call with photo, message and location</string> <string name="notification_incoming_call_attachments">Incoming call with attachments</string> <string name="notification_incoming_call_with_location">Incoming call with location</string> <string name="notification_incoming_call_with_message">Incoming call with message</string> <string name="notification_incoming_call_with_message_location">Incoming call with message and location</string> <string name="notification_incoming_call_with_photo">Incoming call with photo</string> <string name="notification_incoming_call_with_photo_location">Incoming call with photo and location</string> <string name="notification_incoming_call_with_photo_message">Incoming call with photo and message</string> <string name="notification_incoming_call_with_photo_message_location">Incoming call with photo, message and location</string> It's not yet clear if attachments will be shown on the screen with incoming calls, but I think it's a pretty safe bet that they will be. After all, knowing there's a photo with the call isn't nearly as compelling as actually seeing it. This was part of the pitch for the Knock Knock feature when Google introduced the Duo app at last year's I/O keynote. The same certainly can be said about locations and messages, as well. So far, there doesn't appear to be an interface for callers to actually attach this type of data, so it's safe to say development is still ongoing. Seeing as most carriers are still stuck on very rudimentary implementations of RCS and intra-network compatibility is moving at a sloth-like pace, I'm sure Google will have this done long before any of us would get to use it. Voicemail Backup Are you the type of person that never deletes voicemails? This one might be for you. It seems that Google will begin asking users if they want to turn on "extra storage" when their voicemail inbox fills its capacity. This allows Google to "manage and backup your voicemail messages" to free up some space. code <string name="voicemail_error_inbox_almost_full_turn_archive_on_title">Turn on extra storage and backup</string> <string name="voicemail_error_inbox_almost_full_turn_archive_on_message">Your mailbox is almost full. To free up space, turn on extra storage so Google can manage and backup your voicemail messages.</string> <string name="voicemail_error_inbox_full_turn_archive_on_title">Turn on extra storage and backup</string> <string name="voicemail_error_inbox_full_turn_archive_on_message">Your mailbox is full. To free up space, turn on extra storage so Google can manage and backup your voicemail messages.</string> <string name="voicemail_action_turn_archive_on">Turn on</string> <string name="voicemail_action_dimiss">No Thanks</string> At this point, I should say that there are a few different things this could be, and I'm at a loss for which one it is. For starters, this could be a new aspect for Project Fi subscribers and the included voicemail service. If so, it might mean Google intends to prompt people with a lot of saved voicemails to push the older ones into their Drive storage. It's a simple explanation, and might be an attempt to squeeze a few bucks out of people that never delete anything, but hardly seems necessary. Another possibility is that this only relates to the voicemails downloaded and stored on your phone, which means it's just a basic housekeeping feature to keep unnecessary audio files out of your local storage or expand the quota to allow for more. I tend to doubt this is the explanation because the text doesn't really line up with that purpose and it seems like the type of thing that should happen automatically, users shouldn't even need to be prompted. Finally, I'm going to take the opportunity to speculate about something a little crazy. Perhaps this is intended for the voicemail service provided by other carriers. If this is the case, I imagine the phone app might detect your voicemail is nearing capacity and offer to manage backups of it. If the user agrees, Google will connect to that provider's voicemail and proceed to back up all of the messages to Drive for the user, then delete them to free up space. Again, this is massively speculative and feels like a long shot... But it's also the type of weirdly cool feature Google occasionally comes up with. There's not much else to go on with this, but it's entirely possible this feature / warning / error message is already live. It may only show up for users connecting to a specific carrier or with special circumstances that aren't very predictable. I'm not really the right person to test it since I only have three voicemails saved, but perhaps readers with a larger backlog will have something to add to this. Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way. Rather than wait for Google to push this download to your devices, which can take days, download and install it just like any other APK.

Carson Saldanha They were mistaken. Artem Russakovskii Which feature specifically? Pedram Haghzaban This post-call messages for failed calls Duder12 Voicemail features will never matter since carriers don't allow them in the US. Prop Dad I use this app for VM. What features don't matter? Richard Riker strange. minsdk is 23, target is 25. Won't install on N (app is not compatible) even when i'm running v9 already. Any dependancy update needed? because no problem with clock from the preview Carson Saldanha Just to confirm, you're trying to sideload it on a Nexus/Pixel device, right? Artem Russakovskii Are you on arm64? Richard Riker uh...totally overseen that. Corey Kinard Is there any way auto post-call spam messages, sent from (detected) spam callers, could be auto blocked and deleted the same way they plan on doing with the verification codes? Rudresh Is this ever coming to non-Nexel devices?

John Unfortunately, many features don't work on the patched version. There are older official versions available for non-Nexus devices at apkmirror. Version 9.something is the latest. We will likely never see an official version. Previous official versions that work on non-Nexus phones were mistakes that were pulled. Samsung and others modify their dialers so that Google Phone doesn't work well unless the stock apps are disabled which may require root. Carlos Rodríguez Midly related, but SMS backups are coming to Nexus devices on O. If you toggle the switch of and on in Settings > System > Backup, a new option for SMS backup appears, just like on the Pixel. Cheers! Lynxy Dear lord, you're right! I'll try to test that the next time I reset the phone while on O. Alex I don't see that option. Nexus 6P in the UK. Latest O version. Carlos Rodríguez In phone settings > system > backup, turn off the switch for backup in Google Drive, then turn it back on. You'll see the SMS backup like on the Pixel. Alex Hmm, that requires deleting what's already backed up. I think I'll skip this until it is rolled out properly. Thanks for the help though. Carlos Rodríguez Yes, deletes the backup, but makes a new one as soon you turn it on. No loss of data actually. Fayas Android O on Nexus 5X. can't see that option to backup SMS. Carlos Rodríguez It only appeared for me when I turned backup off and on. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/6e53aa283e8271597b15df245154ecc06126d368853b89fa516c6076dbf49ac2.jpg Fayas Thanks, I got it after turning off and on back. But it shows me as waiting to back up for SMS and Call Log. Don't know why. Carlos Rodríguez It will eventually back up the SMS. The call log is stil waiting. James Well according to Google's implementation of the omtp visual voicemail standard (https://source.android.com/devices/tech/config/voicemail) it's vvm client "Fetches details of voicemail quota (total mailbox size and occupied size)" from the carrier so it's probably for carriers that have implemented the stock omtp vvm standard like t-mobile. James Briano Tangentially related: Anyone else getting errors with the phone app on Dev Preview 2? App keeps crashing when I have an incoming call. Nexus 6P. Cody Toombs I haven't put the SIM card into my 6P for more than a couple of minutes since the developer previews started going on there, so I can't comment to that exact scenario, but it has been working perfectly on my Pixel running 7.1.2. I've had pretty regular issues with Google apps crashing on DP1 and DP2. It may be a coincidence, but it seems especially bad for any app that uses hardware components like GPS and cellular radio. I'm not complaining since we all should know the deal with bleeding edge releases, but I think the O developer previews have been the buggiest I've used since Google started with KitKat. Andy J "It's not yet clear if attachments will be shown on the screen with incoming calls, but I think it's a pretty safe bet that they will be." Yes - yes it is. All the stuff people are left wondering about is covered in a LOT of depth in the Universal Profile spec - in this particular case, selecting a photo to be shown on the receivers screen when the phone call comes in - is specifically detailed in the spec. It's worth also being aware that as it's also specifically in the spec that the phone book must expose which contacts support Universal Profile - that I'd expect both the contacts app and the dialer app to be opened up to all devices on the Play Store before too much longer - otherwise only Messages supports RCS and people will have phones where they can't actually tell if they can make a video call or send someone a file (or their location) - all they can do is send them a message. Santos Chavez Perhaps the next step is including Google Phone, Android Messages and Google Contacts preloaded on most phones-- some manufacturers have already pledged to include Android Messages as the sole default app so they may expand it to those apps, too, who knows. In the meantime current devices will be able to download the Google dialer and contact apps from the playstore for full RCS capabilities. Like some already have to do for Android Messages currently. mike shwilly Can i just have Swipe to Delete sms feature? Manikandan Guru Working fine on my OP3T. aRvInD Instead of this pretty useless idea, I wish Google places Redial button in same place. Which more people will find relevant and useful... hp-fourtwenty double tap the dial button to redial. tap it once to see the last number dialed. aRvInD No you misunderstood context. I wrote about redial only with call doesn't connect or failed without connecting.. After call disconnects then open dialer - double tap dialer, Simple button there to redial wouldve been great.. F4LL0U7 It's really frustrating that with all of these enhancements, there STILL isn't a way to use your Google Voice number by default instead of your carrier number. You can set the option to place all calls through GV, but if I try to send an SMS follow-up to a rejected call, or send an SMS through Assistant, it still uses the carrier number. Santos Chavez Yeah, I'm hoping for better Voice integration now that Google's revived it. Especially on the sending SMS part; why not have an option of at least routing all SMS through the Google Voice app (which can be done by setting it as the default SMS app, an option that doesn't exist currently). When that is enabled, any background SMS are also sent via that app, for instance when using Assistant. You'd think a Google service would be tightly integrated at the OS level with the whole OS, especially on phones in which Google has full software and hardware control. no? :P I mean, Project Fi is somewhat integrated into the OS, and it uses the same backend as Google Voice... and even then it's not perfect integration either.

It basically allows users to browse their photo collections and select images to be added to a physical picture album that will be printed and mailed to their door. Now Google has updated their mobile Photos apps, so you can create your photo albums right from an iOS or Android device. The new Photo Books feature went live last week shortly after it was announced, but unfortunately it required users to log into Google Photos on a desktop browser. The update to the Photos app on iOS and Android means that’s no longer a requirement, and it still includes the option to have Google’s AI automatically select and format the best pictures. There’s only two types of book to choose from at this point, unfortunately, but the prices are more than reasonable. A 7-inch by 7-inch softcover album with 20 pages will cost you $10, while 20-page hardcover version measures 9 inches by 9 inches and is priced at $20. The other major downside is that Google is only making these Photo Books available to users in the US. There’s no word yet on when or if Google will open this feature up to other parts of the world, but they hopefully will soon.

Skip to content To Inform is to Influence IO, SC, PD, what's in a name? Menu About Information Operations Holistic Organizers IO, Cyber, SC, PD Community Calendar Name and Shame, Educating the Media Information operations · Information Warfare · Russia Russian Hackers Are Using Google’s Own Infrastructure to Hack Gmail Users May 27, 2017 Joel Harding LORENZO FRANCESCHI-BICCHIERAI May 26 2017, 10:42am Security researchers have exposed a sophisticated hacking and disinformation campaign that targeted more than 200 Gmail users. Russian government hackers seem to have figured out that sometimes the best way to hack into people’s Gmail accounts is be to abuse Google’s own services. On Thursday, researchers exposed a massive Russian espionage and disinformation campaign using emails designed to trick users into giving up their passwords, a technique that’s known as phishing. The hackers targeted more than 200 victims, including, among others, journalists and activists critical of the Russian government, as well as people affiliated with the Ukrainian military, and high-ranking officials in energy companies around the world, according to a new report. Researchers at the Citizen Lab, a digital rights research group at the University of Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs, were able to identify all these victims following clues left in two phishing emails sent to David Satter, an American journalist and academic who’s written Soviet and modern Russia, and who has been banned from the country in 2014. On October 7, Satter received a phishing email designed to look like it was coming from Google, claiming someone had stolen his password and that he should change it right away. As with seen with other phishing attacks targeting people affiliated with the Hillary Clinton campaign that led to the DNC leaks of last year, the email, however, didn’t come from Google. It was actually from a group of hackers known as Fancy Bear, or APT28, whom many believe work for Russia’s military intelligence, the GRU. A screenshot of the phishing email received by David Satter (Image: Citizen Lab) The “Change Password” button linked to a short URL from the Tiny.cc link shortener service, a Bitly competitor. But the hackers cleverly disguised it as a legitimate link by using Google’s Accelerated Mobile Pages, or AMP. This is a service hosted by the internet giant that was originally designed to speed up web pages on mobile, especially for publishers. In practice, it works by creating a copy of a website’s page on Google’s servers, but it also acts as an open redirect. According to Citizen Lab researchers, the hackers used Google AMP to trick the targets into thinking the email really came from Google. “It’s a percentage game, you may not get every person you phish but you’ll get a percentage,” John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at Citizen Lab, told Motherboard. So if the victim had quickly hovered over the button to inspect the link, they would have seen a URL that starts with google.com/amp, which seems safe, and it’s followed by a Tiny.cc URL, which the user might not have noticed. (For example: https://www.google[.]com/amp/tiny.cc/63q6iy) Using Google’s own redirect service was also perhaps also a way to get the phishing email past Gmail’s automated filters against spam and malicious messages. “It’s a percentage game, you may not get every person you phish but you’ll get a percentage.” According to Citizen Lab, who doesn’t directly point the finger at Fancy Bear, the email was actually sent by annaablony[@]mail.com. That address was used in 2015 by Fancy Bear to register a domain, according to security firm ThreatConnect. And another domain used in the October attacks exposed by Citizen Lab was also previously linked to Fancy Bear, according to SecureWorks, which tracked the phishing campaign against the DNC and the Clinton campaign. Curiously, the email targeting Satter came just a few days before Google warned some Russian journalists and activists that “government-backed attackers” were trying to hack them using malicious Tiny.cc links. A screenshot of a phishing email received by a Bellingcat journalist in October Now we know that in October of 2016, when the hackers targeted Satter and at least 200 other people, the trick of using Google AMP was working, and Google hadn’t blocked it. Google has previously dismissed concerns about open redirectors, arguing that “a small number of properly monitored redirectors offers fairly clear benefits and poses very little practical risk.” On Thursday, a company spokesperson said that this is a known issue and last year some Google AMP URLs started showing a warning if the company’s systems are uncertain whether the link is safe to visit, such as this. But for some security researchers, they are dangerous. “The AMP service’s behavior as an open redirect for desktop browsers was clearly abused in this situation and is also just trivial to abuse in general,” Nicholas Weaver, a senior researcher at the International Computer Science Institute at UC Berkeley, told Motherboard in an email. “There is undoubtedly some engineering tradeoff I’m not seeing that causes them to maintain it.” Google’s redirectors might not be the only part of Google’s infrastructure that Fancy Bear hackers have been taking advantage of. Citizen Lab researchers found a Tiny.cc URL that targeted an email address—myprimaryreger[@]gmail.com—that other security researchers suspect was used by Fancy Bear to test their own attacks. A screenshot of the Google Plus page of “myprimaryreger[@]gmail.com,” an account researchers believe was controlled by Fancy Bear (Image: Citizen Lab). That address had a Google Plus page filled with images that appear in real, legitimate Gmail security alerts. It’s unclear what the hackers used these for, or if they used them at all. But the researchers said that perhaps the hackers were embedding them in phishing emails, and the fact that they were hosted on Google Plus perhaps helped thwart Gmail’s security controls. The Fancy Bear hackers are known to use popular services like URL shorteners in their high-profile hacking operations. And, sometimes, those URL shorteners betray them and end up revealing who they targeted. Between March 2015 and May 2016, as part of their operation to hack Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta, and former National Security Advisor Colin Powell, the hackers targeted more than 6,000 people with more than 19,000 phishing links. Some of those used Bitly URLs that, as it turned out, could be decoded to figure out who they were intended to. An analysis of the Bitly link used to phish John Podesta (Image: Thomas Rid/Twitter) Similarly, in this case Citizen Lab researchers were able to identify the victims by figuring out that there was a pattern behind how Tiny.cc creates short URLs. That pattern, as research fellow Adam Hulcoop explained to me, “was chronological.” So, starting from the links sent to Satter, the researchers were able to guess other links created around the same time. It’s impossible to know why the hackers keep relying on services like Bitly or Tiny.cc, which end up exposing some of their operations—although months later. One explanation could be that their phishing campaigns are highly automated, given that they target thousands of people. So, as Hulcoop put it, they need a modular phishing infrastructure where every element can be modified if needed, as “an insurance policy of sorts” and they use third party services “to try and balance the need for OpSec [operational security, or the practice of keeping operations secret] with the ability to operate at scale.” “The construction of the Tiny.cc shortcodes pointing to TinyURL shortcodes, which ultimately point to phishing sites on different servers. This modularity is likely by design so that the operator can change up the individual components, servers, redirectors, etc., and only abandon the pieces that are burned,” he said in an online chat. “The more layers you have, the more flexible you can be.” Source: https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/russian-hackers-are-using-googles-own-infrastructure-to-hack-gmail-users Advertisements Share this: Pinterest Tumblr LinkedIn Google Twitter Facebook Email Reddit Print Like this: Like Loading...

Morris May 27, 2017 Apparently Google’s mastery of data doesn’t extend to its own wage information – at least, not when it’s under investigation. During Friday testimony in a Department of Labor suit accusing Google of widespread and systematic wage discrimination against women, the tech giant’s lawyers argued that continued compliance with government demands for salary records would be too expensive and complicated. Google representatives testified that further reporting would take as much as 500 labor-hours and cost $100,000. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. As reported by The Guardian, Department of Labor lawyers pushed back against Google's objections, with DoL attorney Ian Eliasoph saying “Google would be able to absorb the cost as easily as a dry kitchen sponge could absorb a single drop of water.” A Google lawyer claimed that the company had already devoted 2,300 labor hours and $500,000 to complying with parts of the government’s requests for records. A Google manager describing the process said that it had required building new systems while reviewing and revising large amounts of data. Over time, those efforts have become “too burdensome.” But DoL lawyers pointed out that Google earns millions of dollars annually from government contracts, which require stringent compliance with equal opportunity laws. The Labor Department also attempted to rebuff Google’s claims that these tasks were too complex because of the size of its workforce. Eliasoph said “Google takes routine requests and makes them sound onerous by emphasizing the number of people involved.” Google's claims of burden are also odd because the company has previously conducted its own in-depth internal analysis of pay practices, which it says found no gender discrimination. In fact, Google says it has closed both gender and race-based pay gaps in its U.S. workforce. On its page devoted to fair pay best practices, Google describes the analysis behind that conclusion as “a complicated process [that] requires advanced statistics skills and could have serious legal implications for your organization.” Customer ServiceSite MapPrivacy PolicyAdvertisingAd ChoicesTerms of UseYour California Privacy RightsCareers © 2017 Time Inc.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Sun, May 28, 2017 - Page 16　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Apple said to plan dedicated AI chip FUTURE BUSINESS:The company has not been implementing AI aggressively despite its importance in self-driving cars and augmented reality, on which Apple is focusing Bloomberg Apple Inc got an early start in artificial intelligence (AI) software with the 2011 introduction of Siri, a tool that lets users operate their smartphones with voice commands. Now the electronics giant is bringing AI to chips. Apple is working on a processor devoted specifically to AI-related tasks, a person familiar with the matter said. The chip, known internally as the Apple Neural Engine, would improve the way Apple devices handle tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence, such as facial and speech recognition, said the person, who requested anonymity discussing a product that has not been made public. Apple declined to comment. Engineers at Apple are racing to catch their peers at Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc in the booming field of AI. While Siri gave Apple an early advantage in voice-recognition, competitors have been more aggressive in deploying AI across their product lines, including Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Home digital assistants. “Two of the areas that Apple is betting its future on require AI,” said Gene Munster, former Apple analyst and cofounder of venture capital firm Loup Ventures. “At the core of augmented reality and self-driving cars is artificial intelligence.” Apple devices handle complex AI processes with two different chips: the main processor and the graphics chip. The new chip would let Apple offload those tasks onto a dedicated module designed specifically for demanding AI processing, allowing Apple to improve battery performance. Should Apple bring the chip out of testing and development, it would follow other semiconductor makers that have already introduced dedicated AI chips. Qualcomm Inc’s Snapdragon chip for smartphones has a module for handling AI tasks, while Google announced its first chip, called the Tensor Processing Unit, last year. That chip worked in Google’s data centers to power search results and image recognition. At its I/O conference this year, Google announced a new version that is to be available to clients of its cloud business. Nvidia Corp also sells a similar chip to cloud customers. Apple has tested prototypes of new iPhones with the chip, the person with knowledge of the matter said, adding that it is unclear if the component will be ready this year. The company’s operating systems and software features would integrate with devices that include the chip. For example, Apple has considered offloading facial recognition in the photographs application, some parts of speech recognition, and the iPhone’s predictive keyboard to the chip, the person said. Apple also plans to offer developer access to the chip so third-party apps can also offload AI-related tasks, the person said. An AI chip would join a growing list of processors that Apple has created in-house. The company began designing its own main processors for the iPhone and iPad in 2010 with the A4 chip. It has since released dedicated processors to power the Apple Watch, the motion sensors across its products, the wireless components inside of its AirPods and the fingerprint scanner in the MacBook Pro. The company has also tested a chip to run the low-power mode on Mac laptops. This story has been viewed 2118 times. Comments will be moderated.

Data editor at Google News, Simon Rogers, said the new tool will let you turn difficult number charts into more entertaining GIF illustrations. Data GIF Maker as Google calls its new tool, will allow you to set your desired parameters and transform them into data visuals. Journalists, according to Rogers, will find Data GIF Maker highly reliable when telling their stories. As a matter of fact, it is a tool that will benefit virtually every use—and not just journalists. What use can the animations made from the new tool be to you? You can use them for a lot of things, including storytelling approaches as a journalist. Here is more information on what you can do with Data GIF Maker as described in a blog post by Rogers: “We typically use the tool to represent competing search interest, but it can show whatever you want it to—polling numbers, sales figures, movie ratings, etc. If you want to show search interest, you can compare two terms in the Google Trends explore tool, which will give you an average number (of search interest over time) for each term. Then input those two numbers in Data Gif Maker.” As expected, it’s an online tool that works on your browser, and takes only a few minutes to make your GIF. You can download your GIF as soon as you have finished making it, and of course, use or share it as you wish. Here is a summary of how to use the new online tool: The first step is to start by entering your data points. Next is to choose names for the points of comparison in question. Then, select colors for each of your data entry. And of course, you also need to add explanatory text. Finally, you will have to click ‘Download as GIF’ to generate the images. The steps are obviously very easy to follow, and making your first set of GIFs using the new tool from Google shouldn’t be a difficult task for anyone. You can head up to this Google blog to make your first GIF. Is this Google’s way of competing with Giphy? I don’t really think so, but it presents us with another alternative when it comes to making animated GIFs. In other Google news, an Archive feature has now been added to Google Photos to enable you hide your private photos. Archive will let you remove those private images from the main Photo tab without getting rid of them from your library. Not everyone has seen the new Archive feature yet—and the last time I checked, it wasn’t there. However, the report went on to say that the Archive option is placed in the drawer above Trash. You can access Archive from the overflow menu of any picture—and of course, it comes with a tutorial popping up the first time you open it.

Meet the 'Immigrant' Mexican Jesus Christ from American Gods Some Japanese Men Want Men-Only Train Cars Because Something Wasn't About Them for a Minute Mike Pence Claims Climate Change Is Only an Issue For The Left, Is Just Totally Phoning It in Now Google Says It’s Too Expensive to Investigate Wage Discrimination Because who cares what it costs women? by Marykate Jasper | 12:25 pm, May 27th, 2017   Google, whose parent company made $6.8 billion in pre-tax profits this past quarter alone, has claimed it would be “financially burdensome” for their HR team to spend $100,000 to comply with a federal wage discrimination lawsuit. The company is currently being investigated by the Department of Labor for “systemic compensation disparities” between men and women. And according to a report in The Guardian, its lawyers argued that it should not have to provide wage data as part of the lawsuit, because the effort of pulling the data together would be too expensive, costing $100,000 and requiring 500 hours of labor. The money element is genuinely laughable. Ian Eliasoph, a lawyer for the Department of Labor, openly mocked the claim in court. “Google would be able to absorb the cost as easy as a dry kitchen sponge could absorb a single drop of water,” he said. Plus, based on the latest data from Pew Research Center, Google has likely already robbed women of far more than 500 hours worth of labor. Pew’s 2015 numbers showed that, on average, “it would take an extra 44 days of work for women to earn what men did in 2015.” Assuming a (charitable) 7.5-hour work day, that’s 330 hours per employee per year. Google would only have to wage-discriminate against two women employees per year at the national average in order to ride their way to 500 free hours of labor. Honestly, though, the math isn’t even the most absurd part of this claim. It’s the reversal of the victim dynamic. What Alphabet’s lawyers are arguing is that the real victim here would be Google. Women should expect to be robbed in the name of sexism, but a company can’t be expected to check up on its labor practices to ensure equality. Wage discrimination is a burden women can bear; the cost of fair labor practices, though, is a burden the company cannot. The Department of Labor initially sued Google in January 2017 for failing to comply with its obligations as a federal contractor. Back in September of 2015, Google was asked to submit its compensation data as part of a routine compliance evaluation. However, they repeatedly failed to do so over the next year and a half, and so the Department of Labor filed a suit. In an official statement, the Acting Director of the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, Thomas M. Dowd, said, “Like other federal contractors, Google has a legal obligation to provide relevant information requested in the course of a routine compliance evaluation. Despite many opportunities to produce this information voluntarily, Google has refused to do so. We filed this lawsuit so we can obtain the information we need to complete our evaluation.” It’s worth noting the racial dynamics of this as well. Google’s workforce is overwhelmingly white and Asian, which would usually mean that the wage gap should be smaller and less noticeable. Nationally, black women and Latinx women suffer the most from the wage gap, while white women’s earnings now outpace those of black and Hispanic workers of all genders. Meanwhile, Asian women overall face the smallest wage gap among women as compared to white, non-Hispanic men – but these overall numbers definitely mask the very high wage gaps for groups like Burmese, Indonesian, Pakistani, Fijian, and Vietnamese women. (However, given their other labor practices, I’m willing to guess that Google mostly hires its Asian worker population from those groups that are already more advantaged.) Now, in fairness to Google, lawyers are paid to make ridiculous “undue burden” arguments like this one. It’s part of their job to defend their client, and Google isn’t unique in this. However, the company’s resistance to turning over their salary information tells me all I need to know: they know it won’t look good. Looks like it’s time to update that retired company motto. “Don’t be evil – to white men.” (Via The Guardian and Business Insider; image via Shutterstock) Want more stories like this?

Google is now offering four free months of Google Play Music for new subscribers Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/26 2:17pm PDTMay 26, 2017 82 Plus 1 on G+ 614 Share on Facebook 102 Share on Twitter Total Shares798 Google News Right now it looks like Google is running a special offer for Google Play Music. New subscribers that sign up here can get four free months of service instead of the usual three. No telling how long this offer might last, so if you have been considering subscribing, now might be the time to do it. It could save you an extra $10. Again, this particular offer is only for new subscribers. I've been a fan of Play Music for a long time, though the device removal limit does get in the way when you switch between devices and ROMs as often as I do. Being able to mix your own library with those of a service also comes in handy. That way I can continue to support artists I am passionate about, without eschewing the larger selection of a subscription offering for the purposes of content discovery, all while being able to fill the gaps in that library. There are a lot of different music services out there, but if you're interested combining your curated library with music available via a subscription, then your options are limited. Spotify does allow you to play back locally stored files, which is convenient, but it isn't quite the same. Amazon also allows you to upload your music for playback via Amazon Music, and with Amazon Prime membership, you get a small library of streaming music to go along with that. For $10 a month ($8 for Prime members) you can access their full library as well. But, Google Play Music has a great interface and plugs nicely into all the other Google services we love. Maybe with this new offer, it's time you gave Google Play Music a chance? After all, even if it doesn't end up working out, you still got four free months of music out of the deal.

Carson Saldanha Wait, wdym 3 different countries? Did you share it with others or something? Ailín Ó’S I live in Ireland, so that's my main account. I have a secondary account based in England as part of a mail forwarder service I use, and my bf is Greek so I had him check the code on his account :) Carson Saldanha Oh wow! Carson Saldanha Hey, since I know it worked for you, are you able to use YouTube Red along with this Play Music free trial? Because my YT Red doesn't seem to be enabled for me. Ailín Ó’S No, unfortunately not as I live in the EU and YouTube Red is only available in USA. Carson Saldanha Weird, I'm in the US though. Ailín Ó’S Ooh that is odd. Sign out of the app then sign back in maybe? Carson Saldanha No luck :( I'm in contact with Google support atm Hopefully they can sort this out Mike Worth it alone for Youtube Red MisterAlex Sweet, I wasn't sure if that was included. Thanks. Should mention that in the main blog post. Ben Still no student membership >:( Ailín Ó’S Spotify is a great alternative @€$£5/month. Ben I know that's what I use just because it's half the price. Ailín Ó’S In Ireland Vodafone have a partnership with Spotify whereby it costs €5 standard instead of €10 regardless of if you're a student or not, they even bundle it with some of their plans. Vodafone do the same in some other countries they operate in (not all). Maybe see if any network in your country has a partnership like that? Worth a shot! Ben Oh yeah I'm on EE in the UK and I've got Apple Music for free for 6 months but like iTunes is a massive stinking turd. Ailín Ó’S I'd rather go back to the days of getting music via Bluetooth from friends than use crApple Music 😂😂 Rahul Krishna In india, we have play music for 1.4 usd/month Umang Ladia I'm only seeing 2 months offer in India.?? Rahul Krishna Well I subscribed to it when it launched here (about 2 months ago), so I can't confirm that. But at this price, there is nothing to be disappointed about. aRvInD I wish Spotify launches soon here. I can't keep using that patched version here...!! Rahul Krishna Me too xyz As it should be, you can't charge European or American prices in India. Rahul Krishna Yes true. There are lots​ of people here with a very cheap Android phone. They cannot pay much money. Julian Coronado That's actually what's keeping me away from Play Music. I've used my free months and I loved the Youtube Red too. But as a student, Spotify for $5 / month is too great to pass up on. Emiliejmosley Google is paying 97$ per hour! Work for few hours & have longer with friends and family! !sm141c: On tuesday I got a great new Land Rover Range Rover from having earned $8752 this last four weeks.. Its the most-financialy rewarding I've had..

Cakefish Spotify ftw ToniCipriani ✓pǝᴉɟᴉɹǝʌ I don't think this is a new offer, got this a while back. In fact my 4 months is expiring next week. Prefer Spotify over it. Song selection a tad bit weaker, and for foreign songs it tries to translate the song names to English and makes it hard to look up. folkrav I like it, it's way cheaper than Spotify for me - my mother, my sister, my wife and myself each pay 30$ a year and we're set - but Jesus do I hate the clients. I don't like the website's interface, I hate the Android app. But yeah, I'll deal with it cause it's cheap, I guess. Carson Saldanha Got it! Yay! Jim I wish I could somehow get it on my Amazon Echo hahaha. I guess if I had paid for a Google Home it would be worth trying out. Forget vega #getEVGA Why google play music isn't available in my country ? Ailín Ó’S Try Apple Music? They seem to be just about everywhere. Iamsecond And this is why Apple continue to dominate, because Apple are truly interested in being an international company whereas Google is just playing at it. Such a shame xyz Because Google sucks. Bartek Juszczak My GPM radio's are so good these days I love that Google is so into AI. Whether It's just "I'm being lucky" or radio from a specific song, band or album they very rarely disappoint me these days. I just make sure to thumbs up if it plays a song I particularly love. I am a student and could go cheaper with spotify but the AI generated playlists have me locked in. If it's £5 cheaper but I'm not gonna enjoy it nearly as much then it's not really a good deal. AndTheWorldMayNeverKnow I used the 3 or 4 months free trial during the holidays then bought the family plan for $14.99 a month. 4 people in my family us it and it works great, the app could use some tweaks but it's really good overall. paev If you listen to main stream music it doesn't really matter what service to use. However, if you like something unusual, weird or other languages then Google is a way to go. I found bands on Google music that Spotify displayed as not found. Google also have new synth bands that Spotify doesn't. I'm for Google too. Daniel I discovered that GPM is kinda like a music label. I once went to a section of Google play explaining how indie artists can use GPM like a music label as long as they own all their rights. Ryne Hager Ultraista (among others) keeps me using Google Play Music as well as Spotify. Carson Saldanha Does anyone else who activated the Play Music trial have YouTube Red working as well? My YT Red doesn't seem to be enabled while my Play Music is. Michael Carr I spotted a similar offer a couple of months ago, and I took it after a day or two's thought. Just last week, I moved directly into a family plan. PewPewYoureDead It's hard to recommend Google Play Music until they revamp the UI. Margaritas Ante Porcos Google Music is the only choice in some markets, like Russia, where no Spotify or Pandora are available. There are too many shortcomings in Google Music and Google never shows interest in making services better than below average. I really wonder why Google refuses to become the best at anything. Real magic here. Pixel syndrome all the way. Yet Google Music is on my phone and I use it because there's no choice whatsoever. Rob You answered your own question. If there's no alternative, then they don't have any incentive to improve the service. SupahNin10doh Stupid Dorito logo... Raymond Berger Huh, I just subscribed to the trial but you youtube red hasn't kicked in yet. Any idea how long it takes? Iamsecond If you live in the UK, about 2 years so far h20ray Google Play Music is currently available in select territories and for select account types. Umang Ladia I'm only seeing 2 months offer in India, anybody can confirm? Mohammad Ovais Yeah, same for me. Maybe it's region limited. Isolde I think you need to open the link in a browser, if you open it in the app it's just the normal 2 months. bligui Confirmed need to open it from link and it works Manoj | Blogging Triggers Is Google Music really worth to it? We have better alternatives Sathiya Moorthy Karan I came across a great post, it seems to be so cool http://developeit.net/android-news-image-scanner-finder/ Zachariah Mann It only shows up as 2 free months for me. I live in Michigan. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a19b7e9dddb67bf897c751aedf63c01917048214140db901fd783b2182d8d5c0.png Jefferson Rodrigues https://play.google.com/music/listen?coupon=120DFREE&coupontype=vanity#/sulp Zachariah Mann That link still brought me to the same page on the Play Music App which offers 2 months free. Does it matter if I'm opening it on a computer or web page? Jefferson Rodrigues I don't know. Mikael Jakobsson Should mabye joine premium at Google Music if that coste like $2 max a month dont understand why they should take as mutch as someone some has app or Win32 software to PC so music controllers one they keyboards works. Tab out frome a game for pause music when the round is over is just bad. Arif Gürü And stil isnt available on Turkey xyz "No telling how long this offer might last, so if you have been considering subscribing, now might be the time to do it." No thanks, I'll just use YouTube. Only thing YT needs is an option to play audio only so I can save a wee bit more data when I don't need video. Cai Copley Nope. If it wasn't for the fact work pays for Spotify Premium and the fact Spotify has Crossfade to emulate a DJ system, maybe I'd give it a whirl. bligui Not working any more to bad Follow Android Police 1.49M 472k 145k 119k Latest Deals 9 [Deal Alert] Chromecast Ultra is $59.99 ($10 off) at Google Store, Best Buy, B&H and others 2017/06/04 12:16pm PDTJun 4, 2017 13 [Deal Alert] Google Home is $109 ($20 off) at Best Buy, Google Store, B&H, and others 2017/06/04 10:07am PDTJun 4, 2017 12 [Deal Alert] Kick off the weekend with 24 temporarily free and 52 on-sale apps 2017/06/03 6:50pm PDTJun 3, 2017 18 [Deal Alert] Get a Nextbit Robin for $129.99 on eBay 2017/06/03 9:39am PDTJun 3, 2017 33 [Deal Alert] A Stork's Journey is currently free on Google Play Movies & TV 2017/06/01 10:50pm PDTJun 1, 2017 Latest Poll How many photos are on your Google Photos account?

However the good news is that Google is now offering new subscribers a 4 month free trial which means that if you’re curious as to whether or not Google Play Music is a good fit for you, you’ve got 4 months to try it out. Note that the 4 month trial is longer than some of the competition, namely Apple Music which is only offering users a 3 month free trial. In fact in some countries Apple has actually started to charge their users a $0.99 fee to take part in the trial, so for some users this trial isn’t even free at all. However we should point out that Google’s offer is only for new subscribers, meaning that if you’ve never signed up for a Google Play Music account/trial before, then only can you participate. If you’ve taken part in the previous trial then we guess you’d be out of luck. Then again the previous trial was for 3 months and we’re not sure if the extra month really makes a difference in coming to a decision. There’s no word on how long this offer will last or if it is permanent, however Google’s website states that it is a special offer so perhaps it might not be permanent. More details can be found on the Play Store. Filed in Audio. Read more about Google and Music.

Tech giants seeking to reinforce their leads in artificial intelligence or make up for lost ground have been the most aggressive buyers. Alphabet Inc.’s Google has acquired 11 AI start-ups since 2012, the most of any firm, followed by Apple Inc., Facebook Inc., and Intel Corp., respectively. The companies declined to comment on their acquisition strategies. A spokesman for Apple did confirm the company’s recent purchase of Lattice Data, a start-up that specializes in working with unstructured data. Ford Motor The first quarter also saw one of the largest deals to date as Ford Motor Co. invested $1 billion in Argo AI, founded by former executives on self-driving teams at Google and Uber Technologies Inc. Start-ups are looking to go deep on applications of artificial intelligence to specific fields, such as health and retail, industry observers say, rather than compete directly with established companies. What you will see is very big players will build platform services, and start-up communities will migrate more to applied intelligent apps, said Matt McIlwain, managing director of Madrona Venture Group. Healthcare start-up Forward, for example, is using artificial intelligence to crunch data that can inform doctors recommendations. For people who really want to focus on core AI problems, it makes a lot of sense to be in bigger companies, said Forward CEO Adrian Aoun, who previously worked at Google. But for folks who really want to prove a new field, a new area, it makes more sense to be separate. AI companies that do remain independent field a steady stream of suitors: Matthew Zeiler, CEO of Clarifai, which specializes in image and video recognition, said he has been approached about a dozen times by prospective acquirers since starting the firm in 2013. Clarifai’s pitch to customers such as consumer goods company Unilever Plc. and hotel search firm Trivago is bolstered by its narrow focus on artificial intelligence. “(Google) literally competes with almost every company on the planet,” he said. “Are you going to trust them with being your partner for AI?” Tech giants have been locked in a bidding war for academics specializing in artificial intelligence. A company with a specialised mission can win over recruits, said Vic Gundotra, chief executive of AliveCor, which makes an AI-driven portable heart monitor. “They say, I want to come here and work on a project that might save my mother’s life,” Mr. Gundotra said.

Tech giants seeking to reinforce their leads in artificial intelligence or make up for lost ground have been the most aggressive buyers. Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google has acquired 11 AI startups since 2012, the most of any firm, followed by Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Intel Corp (INTC.O), respectively, according to CB Insights. The companies declined to comment on their acquisition strategies.

They can try a more complicated setup using the advanced modes of the operating system: Beta Mode or Dev Mode – short for developer mode. We’ll show you how to switch your Chromebook to Beta Mode or Dev Mode and back to Stable Mode. The Chromebook offers simplicity that most mobile laptop platforms can’t match. It’s nearly immune from viruses and significant malware. It’s as simple as your browser to use. ChromeOS does face complications, but unlike Windows, macOS or Linux, if a user faces a catastrophic failure, they can simply Powerwash their Chromebook in under fifteen to thirty minutes and it’s back up and running like before with all their apps and settings in place. The simple Powerwash gets a little more complicated for Chromebooks with Android apps installed on them. After the simple restoration process completes, it takes more time to then install the Android apps that the user installed before the Powerwash. Why Switch to Beta Mode or Dev Mode on a Chromebook? Users usually switch their Chromebook to Beta or Dev mode because they want to take advantage of features that Google plans to add to a future version of ChromeOS. These features typically aren’t ready or stable enough for the Stable mode of ChromeOS. For example, the Google Play Store only works on some Chromebooks in Stable Mode, but works on a few more if they’re running in Beta Mode or Dev Mode. Also, the new Settings screen looks cleaner and better organized in more recent builds of ChromeOS, but only shows up in Beta or Dev Mode. If you want Android apps but don’t see the Play Store logo on your ChromeOS Shelf, then you might get the store if you switch to Beta or Dev Mode. Go to the Chromium list of supported systems to find out if your model supports the store yet and in which ChromeOS mode. See the screenshot above. Notice the name of the manufacturer in the first column and the model name in the second. Then see whether your computer has the Play Store and whether it works in Stable, Beta or Dev Mode. Remember that switching to either Beta or Dev Mode will make your Chromebook less stable. If Stable is the most reliable of the three modes, Dev Mode is the least and Beta Mode sits between them on the spectrum of stability. Don’t switch unless you’re ready for some glitches, freezes and apps shutting down without warning. You can lose work and this can get frustrating. I run my Samsung Chromebook Plus in Dev Mode with few problems. Fortunately, if you experience an issue, you can just return to Stable Mode following the steps below. How to Switch to Beta Mode or Dev Mode Before going any further, back up any data on your Chromebook that you want to keep. If your Chromebook has an SD card or micro-SD card reader, then copy files to it using the Files app. You can also upload them to your Google Drive. Click on your Profile icon and then the Settings icon. Open Settings on your Chromebook. Do this by clicking on your user icon in the lower right corner and then choose the Settings icon. It looks like a gear icon and sits above the date in the pop-up box. Click on the About Chrome OS link at the top of the Settings screen. Now click on the About Chrome OS link at the top center of the Settings screen. Click on More info… below the Check for and apply updates button. Click on the More info… link below the Check for and apply updates button. Now, you’ll see a Change channel button in the center of the next screen. Click on it. Choose the Mode you’d prefer and click on the Change channel button. Choose the Mode you’d prefer and click on the Change channel button. Remember that Developer – is the most unstable of the three options. After you pick your mode and click on the Change channel button, then the Chromebook will offer to Restart. The Chromebook will restart and ask you to sign in to “Install a critical update”. Sign in and then choose Update from the dialog box that shows up once it restarts. The Chromebook will install the update and then restart again, erase the drive and install the new version of ChromeOS. How to Return to Stable Mode in ChromeOS What if you’re not pleased with Dev Mode or Beta Mode? You can easily change the channel again and go back to Stable. After you update to Beta or Dev Mode in ChromeOS version 59 or 60, the Settings screens will look very different. Follow these instructions to change channels in the newer version of Settings in ChromeOS. Click on Settings in the Upper Left corner. You still open Settings the same way. Click on your profile icon and choose the Settings icon that looks like a gear above the date. A new box will open. Click on Settings in the upper left corner of the box. Choose About Chrome OS along the left at the bottom of the list. Now click on the About Chrome OS link in the bottom of the list that flies out from the left edge of the Settings dialog box. This takes you to a new screen. Find the Detailed build information item in the new screen in the center of the box. Click on it and then click on the CHANGE CHANNEL button about a third of the way down on the right (see below). Click on CHANGE CHANNEL on the right of the list next to the Channel item in the list. A new box pops up with the three options. To go back to Stable, select it from the list and choose CHANGE CHANNEL AND POWERWASH. Pick your Mode and then click the blue button. You may prefer to try Beta mode, if you’re running Dev Mode and it’s too unstable. Beta Mode will not cause as many problems for as many users as Dev Mode. However, to get a reliable experience with the fewest crashes, pick Stable and then click on the button. The Chromebook may seem to do nothing, but it’s downloading the Stable version of ChromeOS. Give it time. When it’s finished, click on the button that says RELAUNCH AND POWERWASH. The Chromebook restarts and shows a screen telling you that it’s Powerwashing the computer. This erases the system and restarts in factory state as if you just opened and turn it on for the first time. Go through the typical process of setting up your Chromebook and you’re ready to go again.

Google has always been a company run by engineers for engineers. It looks like it’s also going to give some of them a shot at running a venture capital project that will fund research into one of the company’s most central efforts. Axios reported Friday that Google is setting up an investment arm aimed squarely on artificial intelligence, and it seems like it will be separate from Google Ventures, the company’s formal investment organization. Dan Primack reported that the group will be led by Anna Patterson, and will operate almost like an incubator with a shared workspace for AI startups and mentorship from some of Google’s best AI folks. A lot of entrepreneurs are wary of corporate venture capital: just look at the experience of Nucleus, which took money from Amazon to build a voice-controlled tablet powered by Alexa only to see Amazon trot out the Echo Show a year later. But Google is one of the powerhouses of AI research, and it has more enormous data sets for training algorithms than just about anybody.

[Update: Now $75 Off] Deal Alert: Pixel 32GB (international version) is $50 off on eBay Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/05/26 2:20pm PDTMay 26, 2017 2 Plus 1 on G+ 53 Share on Facebook 57 Share on Twitter Total Shares112 Deals News Pixel Update 1: 2017/05/26 2:32pm PDT It looks like the price has dropped another $25, making this a $75 savings in total. For a device that hasn't seen much in the way of price drops or It's no secret that Google has had some serious supply issues with its flagship Pixel phone. That goes for pretty much any combination of size, color, or storage. Rumors even began to surface alleging that Google had stopped production of the devices altogether. That wasn't the case, but nonetheless, you will still struggle to actually find the Pixel if you wish to buy it. A 32GB Pixel (international version) on eBay for $50 off the list price could be the answer to that problem. This is the entry level 5" Pixel, with 32GB of storage in the color Very Silver - and it's available for $599. That's $50 less than the $649 Google is still charging for it. Beware though, this is the international version of the device. So if you live in the US you'll have to check the bands to see if it works on your network. This version won't play nice with Verizon or Sprint, so if you're on either of those carriers you can rule this out. If you live outside the US then this is definitely for you. Shipping appears to be free in the US, but here in the UK, it's $18.99. That still works out a bargain for me, especially if you account for the exchange rate. You'll have to do the sums from where you are to see if the deal is as good for you. It's worth mentioning that getting your warranty honored might be tough with this type of purchase, so bear that in mind. It's hard to say how many of these they have, other than a "limited quantity," so you'll have to be quick if you want to get your hands on arguably the best Android phone of 2016. Update 1: 2017/05/26 2:32pm PDT It looks like the price has dropped another $25, making this a $75 savings in total. For a device that hasn't seen much in the way of price drops or sales since launch, $75 off isn't bad. Anyone interested in a Pixel that uses a network compatible with this international model should give it a serious think.

Middlefinger As a back up phone yeah, its not reliable enough to be a daily driver. Its problems seem to be a mixture of hardware bugs, and Googles poor software QC. me me "bargain" JL "buggy" Gladysrcrosby Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job.

It doesnt matter how 'high end' a device is, if it doesn't work properly, its worthless. jonzey231 $50 is worth a guarantee that Google will honor the warranty....trust me...I wish I would've gotten my 6P direct. Andy What do you mean? jonzey231 If you don't buy the phone from Google, they won't help you. They send you to the manufacturer. I was forced to go to Huawei for my 6P and it was a little over 3 weeks before I got it back....and the problem is still there. Spend the extra $50 and buy it through Google so you're guaranteed to get support through their CS channels. You'll be glad you did in 6 months when something inevitably goes wrong. IMHO get the OnePlus 3T. Costs less but has better overall specs aside from the camera which is still pretty good in its own right. My brother has one and my roommate just got his last week and they both have no intention of going back to a major brand ever again. YaKillaCJ Same happened when I got the OnePlus One. It changed the way I (and many others) view a "budget" device from an unknown brand. needa I felt the same way after using an OPO for nearly three years. Got me an XL in mint condition for $450. Google edition even. Still had 3520 mAh in the batt too. Would have bought the black 3T had they been in stock. Took me three days to hunt down this deal. Andy Got my wife the pixel. Runs great. Just had the microphone problem. Google swapped without question. Wife seems to think it takes horrible selfies. Rod Weird, as it's cameras are regarded among the best currently. Random! @andy maybe you should let her know that the camera isn't the problem... It's actually her face. If you do warn her about this, I promise to visit you at the hospital. Andy Thanks for the tip. VAVAMk_2 Huzzah! Master Yates Agreed with you regarding the 3T. Lets see if the excellent updates and support evaporate when the One Plus 5 is released? That's the real test. IcerC Except in this case Google is the Manufacturer, that might change things. VAVAMk_2 Google didn't make the camera. Uses a Sony made sensor but the camera software is Google's and regarded among the best in post processing, particularly HDR. Roy Ahh so nice call me when the 1+2 will get Nougat and your friend will get or never get Android O. ddevito #Fail Andy S8 release response? AdMoc Does not ship to Poland as fck always -_- Random! Look for some service like Shipito. I believe they have an EU warehouse. Shakil Shaikh $60 shipping? kristin ANY Pixel made by google is compatible with any provider. It doesnt matter if its international or not. This writer is an odiot. Scott Scrivens https://www.techwalls.com/google-pixel-pixel-xl-model-number-differences/ Kevin Davis "Odiot", lmao. 😂 Oh, and you're wrong, too. kristin I called google about this. It would be up your phone company provider whether it worked or not. So it may not work with att or tmobile either. kristin This may or may not work on any provider. Its up to the provider. You want a pixel? Go to swappa.com and get one used in mint condition for much cheaper. Ive gotten a few phones from them since ive been on project fi and had no issues. Ill never buy a new phone again. Random! $50 off? How cute... If they get to $300 off ($350 final price) within a month, I might even convince myself it's worth to stare at those bezels everyday. Other than that (impossible) scenario, I'd rather get the 3T, Axon 7, or even the LG G5. Gjorgi Lazarovski The Pixel is probably not dropping in price anytime soon. iKon The most overrated smartphone of 2016. Only the camera is decent. Ugly ass design, overpriced and dull with no features compared to competition Roy You mean the best smartphone of 2016, best camera rare band front, best software, best updates. Great battery, great display. xyz No, he means "The most overrated smartphone of 2016. Only the camera is decent. Ugly ass design, overpriced and dull with no features compared to competition." Roy No, I'm sure he/she means "the best smartphone of 2016, best camera rare band front, best software, best updates. Great battery, great display". iKon No I meant what I said. The pixel is a flop and even Google knows it. No matter how much money they put into advertising there are alot of better choices out there.. only hard core Google fanboys try and big it up Roy Yes yada yada and still every reviewer said is the best smartphone of 2016. So.. even David here. In the on of the day it's a lots about the UI and I just don't like Samsung software. Ordeith LOL. You're such a Google sycophant, Roy. Roy You feeling really smart? I'm Imagine your ass all over your face. nirmitlamed Google is so off track in figuring out what customers wants and competing against the other monstrous companies. I would very much like to hear how many Pixels Google sold in the last year since they told us they sold more than they expected. Lawrence I can put my coffee cup on the Bezel David Nowicki I'm a big Nexus fan, but why would you pay $749 for the Pixel XL vs the OnePlus 3T at about half the price ? And soon the OnePlus 5 at $450 or so with S8+ specs will be a steal compared to the Pixel 4Ui812 Supply and demand. Limit the supply and you increase demand. It's like P.T. Barnum said , "There's a sucker born every minute".

Despite facing off against those bigger competitors, Roku has been steadily winning the battle for your living room. The streaming hardware company cites Nielsen numbers showing that, as of December 2016, Roku accounted for 48% of the active streaming players in the U.S. (with Amazon, Apple, and Google all trailing behind). Roku currently boasts roughly 14 million active accounts—up 40% year-over-year—and the company says its users streamed 9 billion hours of content last year, a 70% increase from the previous year. The company also posted its highest annual revenue in 2016, reaching $400 million, and sales already topped $100 million in the first quarter of the current fiscal year. One thing that helps Roku stand out is the fact that, unlike many of its biggest rivals, the Los Gatos, Calif.-based tech company relies solely on deals with outside content producers. In other words, Roku doesn't make its own original programming, in contrast with Amazon, Google's YouTube, and others. That means it can stay neutral when it comes to carrying streaming apps and the content it markets to users. Related AppleBozoma Saint John Leaving Apple, Report Says Apple Bozoma Saint John Leaving Apple, Report Says As Roku's user base has climbed, the company's focus has shifted somewhat, from selling hardware to generating additional revenue by selling advertising to its many content partners. Advertising and content distribution comprised roughly 75% of Roku's gross profit in the most recent quarter, up from a little over 50% last year, says CEO Anthony Wood, a Silicon Valley veteran and a former vice president at Netflix. Roku also has the backing of a handful of major players in both media and tech, with nearly $210 million in reported funding so far from a list of investors that includes News Corp, Viacom, 21st Century Fox, and Netflix. (Wood disputed reports from February suggesting the company was working on a $200 million funding round, telling Fortune that Roku is "well capitalized" at the moment.) Get Data Sheet, Fortune's technology newsletter. Wood recently spoke with Fortune about competing with tech giants in the streaming hardware market, how user data and targeted ads are the "future of TV," and what the evolving landscape of streaming content means for companies like Roku. (The following conversation has been edited for clarity and length.) Fortune: You currently have the largest market share in the U.S. for streaming devices over companies like Amazon, Apple, and Google. How can you maintain that position and keep growing? Wood: If you look at the market share, it has been growing. We had our biggest market share ever in Q1—not just players, also televisions. 48% of active streaming players in the United States are Roku [according to Nielsen], and that number hasn’t changed in about a year. The other half is split between Amazon, Google, and Apple. Our market share is growing fast. It’s growing 40% to 45% active accounts year-over-year and that’s on a big installed base: 14 million active accounts. That comes from players and TVs. We released the Roku Express at the end of last year at $29 and it’s now our number one player. And, last year, one in eight TVs sold were powered by our OS [operating system]. This year, we expect it to be almost one in five TVs—almost 20% of the Smart TV market this year will be powered by our operating system. Roku Ultra— Courtesy of Roku  Roku has been described as "Switzerland" in the streaming devices market because it's content-neutral. How does that strategy help you stand out versus bigger rivals who produce and distribute their own original content? Having a strategy of carrying as much content possible and the most content definitely is a big part of our strategy and works well for us. And we can do it because we’re an independent company. We’re not vertically integrated like our competitors where they can’t carry each other’s content. So we have Amazon Instant Video and Google Play, for example. And, more importantly, we have built the only proprietary operating system for TV. We have the only purpose-built OS for TV and it’s got lots of advantages: it’s better for partners, it costs less to build TVs with our own OS, it’s a better consumer experience, and it has more content. So, I guess we shouldn't expect to see any Roku original programming anytime soon? [Laughs] You’d have to have a lot of scale, even more scale than Roku [with 14 million active accounts]. We have reasonably large scale and are growing quickly, but Netflix has 100 million accounts. So it makes sense for them to do original content. It doesn’t really make sense for us. You mentioned the success of the relatively new Roku Express. How important are those low-cost devices (including Google's Chromecast and Amazon's Fire TV Stick) to the market versus more expensive set-top boxes? What low-cost does is it brings more customers into streaming. That’s one of the things that we saw with the Roku Express is it was so inexpensive that people who hadn’t streamed before said, "Oh, well I’ll give that a go." And, then as they say, "I love this," then I think there’s a decent chance they will, at some point, upgrade to a more expensive product with more features. With that said, the vast majority of unit retail sales are sub-$50 price points. Most of the market is below $50. It’s one of the main reasons Apple is last in market share for streaming players. We have focused on great value for customers from the beginning as a way to gain market share. We introduced the first $100 streaming player. We introduced the first streaming stick, the first $29 player. We have a strategy of driving prices down to make the product more accessible to consumers. Because, for us, hardware is not a business, it’s a way to acquire active accounts. Our business is advertising and content distribution services. Roku Express— Courtesy of Roku  A big part of the advertising platform is tracking what users are watching to compile and analyze that data for targeted ads and content recommendations. It’s super important. The future of TV—both with content distribution and advertising—is based on data and machine learning. And it’s a huge competitive advantage to be good at that. I just want to clarify that the ACR [Automatic Content Recognition] program is opt-in for our customers. We don’t just force it on them, although it has a very high opt-in rate because we have some very cool features that they get access to that are powered by that data. One of those features is called "More Ways to Watch." If you opt in to the ACR data feed—let’s say you’re watching The Big Bang Theory on CBS—it will pop up with an overlay and say "Hey, you’re watching The Big Bang Theory, do you want to watch it from the beginning?" Because it’s available on CBS All Access and also you can watch all of the back episodes, so it gives them more ways to watch that TV show. There are lots of privacy issues around data that we have to be careful about, but it really delivers a much better end-user experience. When it comes to video content, does Roku root for companies like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon to upend the entertainment industry because it means more people are streaming content and that's good for device-makers? Or, at this point, is most content streaming at some point anyway? The big picture is one of the big drivers of our growth is when more content comes to streaming. Like you said, there’s been an explosion of streaming content. There’s not much you can’t get, if anything, streaming. So, in that sense, we’re completely neutral. We don’t really care. We want to offer our customers choices. I think one of the biggest advantages of streaming, for customers, is that it’s created competition in the TV business, which used to be controlled by a few big distributors and that’s really changed. So, that has resulted in lots of choice for customers: the choice of more content, the choice of not having to watch ads if they don’t want to, they can pay extra or they can sign up for Netflix, or whatever. So that’s all good. I guess we’re not really in anyone’s particular camp. Our biggest focus is just bringing on as much content as we can and keeping our UI [user interface] simple. One of the challenges with a simple UI when there’s so much content is how do you make it easier for customers to find what they want to watch in that sea of content. What are some ways that Roku helps customers manage the deluge of content? We were the first company to offer universal search, so you can search for a program and find out how much it costs and where it’s available and we sort results by price. Another example is we came out with a feature called My Feed, which allows you to follow shows you’re interested in and you’ll get notifications when new episodes come out. What are your thoughts on the proliferation of live-TV streaming services? If they succeed in drawing more consumers away from traditional cable packages, isn't that a game-changer for online content and streaming devices? We’re super positive on those services, because they’re bringing more content to the platform, they bring more people to streaming. We have business deals with all of those services, they buy audience development products, so it’s driving a big increase in our business. But, the dynamics are interesting. They often have overlapping content, so there’s going to be a lot of competition between them. And, I think that will result in better value for the customers. Personally, I am not sure how popular repurposing a linear cable network will be in a streaming environment. Certainly, it's in the millions the number of customers who want it. But is it 100 million, like Netflix? I think that’s an interesting question: whether people have changed the way they want to watch content and what content they want to watch.

Reuters/Kim Hong-Ji Android malware continues to be rampant, and the latest is a new threat called "Cloak and Dagger." Similar to previous attacks, the exploit can gain complete control of an Android phone or tablet with the user fully unaware.  For most, "Cloak and Dagger" may be nothing new when it comes to malware alerts. The damage any exploit can do lies heavily on what he or she downloads from the web or the Google Play Store.  Also, Google has been known to come out with timely updates to address the situation. But the governing problem now is that they are still working on a fix, meaning any Android user can get infected at some point.  “We’ve been in close touch with the researchers and, as always, we appreciate their efforts to help keep our users safer,” a spokesperson told Engadget. “We have updated Google Play Protect — our security services on all Android devices with Google Play — to detect and prevent the installation of these apps." According to the full paper describing the “Cloak and Dagger” attack, the exploit would need only two permissions (the System_Alert_Window permission and The Accessibility Service) in the event it is installed via the Google Play Store. Hence, users don’t need to be asked for access and may not even be notified of the changes, BGR reports. Among the problems the malware would bring include clickjacking, unconstrained keystroke recording, stealthy phishing, the silent installation of a God-mode app (with all permissions enabled) and silent phone unlocking + arbitrary actions. From that list alone, one can imagine how Android users may end up helpless at some point moving forward.  For those who are pinning their hopes on the Android 7.1.2, updating to the latest stable version will not help. It seems that “Cloak and Dagger” goes beyond that, meaning only Google can come up with a remedy to prevent things from getting out of hand.  Based on the full paper about “Cloak and Dagger,” some short-term recommendations to Google have been suggested. One involves tweaking the permissions for the "System_Alert_Window," which should not be automatically granted even for the Play Store. The other recommendation has to do with Google’s process of approving apps in the Play Store. The permissions need to be looked into closely, with manual vetting suggested as a scalable approach. The short-term fix may not be much, though the first one concerned with the "System_Alert_Window" is something Google can immediately revise.

Google is now offering four free months of Google Play Music for new subscribers Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/26 2:17pm PDTMay 26, 2017 82 Plus 1 on G+ 614 Share on Facebook 102 Share on Twitter Total Shares798 Google News Right now it looks like Google is running a special offer for Google Play Music. New subscribers that sign up here can get four free months of service instead of the usual three. No telling how long this offer might last, so if you have been considering subscribing, now might be the time to do it. It could save you an extra $10. Again, this particular offer is only for new subscribers. I've been a fan of Play Music for a long time, though the device removal limit does get in the way when you switch between devices and ROMs as often as I do. Being able to mix your own library with those of a service also comes in handy. That way I can continue to support artists I am passionate about, without eschewing the larger selection of a subscription offering for the purposes of content discovery, all while being able to fill the gaps in that library. There are a lot of different music services out there, but if you're interested combining your curated library with music available via a subscription, then your options are limited. Spotify does allow you to play back locally stored files, which is convenient, but it isn't quite the same. Amazon also allows you to upload your music for playback via Amazon Music, and with Amazon Prime membership, you get a small library of streaming music to go along with that. For $10 a month ($8 for Prime members) you can access their full library as well. But, Google Play Music has a great interface and plugs nicely into all the other Google services we love. Maybe with this new offer, it's time you gave Google Play Music a chance? After all, even if it doesn't end up working out, you still got four free months of music out of the deal.

Carson Saldanha Wait, wdym 3 different countries? Did you share it with others or something? Ailín Ó’S I live in Ireland, so that's my main account. I have a secondary account based in England as part of a mail forwarder service I use, and my bf is Greek so I had him check the code on his account :) Carson Saldanha Oh wow! Carson Saldanha Hey, since I know it worked for you, are you able to use YouTube Red along with this Play Music free trial? Because my YT Red doesn't seem to be enabled for me. Ailín Ó’S No, unfortunately not as I live in the EU and YouTube Red is only available in USA. Carson Saldanha Weird, I'm in the US though. Ailín Ó’S Ooh that is odd. Sign out of the app then sign back in maybe? Carson Saldanha No luck :( I'm in contact with Google support atm Hopefully they can sort this out Mike Worth it alone for Youtube Red MisterAlex Sweet, I wasn't sure if that was included. Thanks. Should mention that in the main blog post. Ben Still no student membership >:( Ailín Ó’S Spotify is a great alternative @€$£5/month. Ben I know that's what I use just because it's half the price. Ailín Ó’S In Ireland Vodafone have a partnership with Spotify whereby it costs €5 standard instead of €10 regardless of if you're a student or not, they even bundle it with some of their plans. Vodafone do the same in some other countries they operate in (not all). Maybe see if any network in your country has a partnership like that? Worth a shot! Ben Oh yeah I'm on EE in the UK and I've got Apple Music for free for 6 months but like iTunes is a massive stinking turd. Ailín Ó’S I'd rather go back to the days of getting music via Bluetooth from friends than use crApple Music 😂😂 Rahul Krishna In india, we have play music for 1.4 usd/month Umang Ladia I'm only seeing 2 months offer in India.?? Rahul Krishna Well I subscribed to it when it launched here (about 2 months ago), so I can't confirm that. But at this price, there is nothing to be disappointed about. aRvInD I wish Spotify launches soon here. I can't keep using that patched version here...!! Rahul Krishna Me too xyz As it should be, you can't charge European or American prices in India. Rahul Krishna Yes true. There are lots​ of people here with a very cheap Android phone. They cannot pay much money. Julian Coronado That's actually what's keeping me away from Play Music. I've used my free months and I loved the Youtube Red too. But as a student, Spotify for $5 / month is too great to pass up on. Emiliejmosley Google is paying 97$ per hour! Work for few hours & have longer with friends and family! !sm141c: On tuesday I got a great new Land Rover Range Rover from having earned $8752 this last four weeks..

Cakefish Spotify ftw ToniCipriani ✓pǝᴉɟᴉɹǝʌ I don't think this is a new offer, got this a while back. In fact my 4 months is expiring next week. Prefer Spotify over it. Song selection a tad bit weaker, and for foreign songs it tries to translate the song names to English and makes it hard to look up. folkrav I like it, it's way cheaper than Spotify for me - my mother, my sister, my wife and myself each pay 30$ a year and we're set - but Jesus do I hate the clients. I don't like the website's interface, I hate the Android app. But yeah, I'll deal with it cause it's cheap, I guess. Carson Saldanha Got it! Yay! Jim I wish I could somehow get it on my Amazon Echo hahaha. I guess if I had paid for a Google Home it would be worth trying out. Forget vega #getEVGA Why google play music isn't available in my country ? Ailín Ó’S Try Apple Music? They seem to be just about everywhere. Iamsecond And this is why Apple continue to dominate, because Apple are truly interested in being an international company whereas Google is just playing at it. Such a shame xyz Because Google sucks. Bartek Juszczak My GPM radio's are so good these days I love that Google is so into AI. Whether It's just "I'm being lucky" or radio from a specific song, band or album they very rarely disappoint me these days. I just make sure to thumbs up if it plays a song I particularly love. I am a student and could go cheaper with spotify but the AI generated playlists have me locked in. If it's £5 cheaper but I'm not gonna enjoy it nearly as much then it's not really a good deal. AndTheWorldMayNeverKnow I used the 3 or 4 months free trial during the holidays then bought the family plan for $14.99 a month. 4 people in my family us it and it works great, the app could use some tweaks but it's really good overall. paev If you listen to main stream music it doesn't really matter what service to use. However, if you like something unusual, weird or other languages then Google is a way to go. I found bands on Google music that Spotify displayed as not found. Google also have new synth bands that Spotify doesn't. I'm for Google too. Daniel I discovered that GPM is kinda like a music label. I once went to a section of Google play explaining how indie artists can use GPM like a music label as long as they own all their rights. Ryne Hager Ultraista (among others) keeps me using Google Play Music as well as Spotify. Carson Saldanha Does anyone else who activated the Play Music trial have YouTube Red working as well? My YT Red doesn't seem to be enabled while my Play Music is. Michael Carr I spotted a similar offer a couple of months ago, and I took it after a day or two's thought. Just last week, I moved directly into a family plan. PewPewYoureDead It's hard to recommend Google Play Music until they revamp the UI. Margaritas Ante Porcos Google Music is the only choice in some markets, like Russia, where no Spotify or Pandora are available. There are too many shortcomings in Google Music and Google never shows interest in making services better than below average. I really wonder why Google refuses to become the best at anything. Real magic here. Pixel syndrome all the way. Yet Google Music is on my phone and I use it because there's no choice whatsoever. Rob You answered your own question. If there's no alternative, then they don't have any incentive to improve the service. SupahNin10doh Stupid Dorito logo... Raymond Berger Huh, I just subscribed to the trial but you youtube red hasn't kicked in yet. Any idea how long it takes? Iamsecond If you live in the UK, about 2 years so far h20ray Google Play Music is currently available in select territories and for select account types. Umang Ladia I'm only seeing 2 months offer in India, anybody can confirm? Mohammad Ovais Yeah, same for me. Maybe it's region limited. Isolde I think you need to open the link in a browser, if you open it in the app it's just the normal 2 months. bligui Confirmed need to open it from link and it works Manoj | Blogging Triggers Is Google Music really worth to it? We have better alternatives Sathiya Moorthy Karan I came across a great post, it seems to be so cool http://developeit.net/android-news-image-scanner-finder/ Zachariah Mann It only shows up as 2 free months for me. I live in Michigan. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a19b7e9dddb67bf897c751aedf63c01917048214140db901fd783b2182d8d5c0.png Jefferson Rodrigues https://play.google.com/music/listen?coupon=120DFREE&coupontype=vanity#/sulp Zachariah Mann That link still brought me to the same page on the Play Music App which offers 2 months free. Does it matter if I'm opening it on a computer or web page? Jefferson Rodrigues I don't know. Mikael Jakobsson Should mabye joine premium at Google Music if that coste like $2 max a month dont understand why they should take as mutch as someone some has app or Win32 software to PC so music controllers one they keyboards works. Tab out frome a game for pause music when the round is over is just bad. Arif Gürü And stil isnt available on Turkey xyz "No telling how long this offer might last, so if you have been considering subscribing, now might be the time to do it." No thanks, I'll just use YouTube. Only thing YT needs is an option to play audio only so I can save a wee bit more data when I don't need video. Cai Copley Nope.

It started with Siri, the digital assistant baked into iOS, that was waiting for me the moment I fired up my iPhone SE for the first time. But now Google is moving in on Apple's turf by releasing an iOS version of Google Assistant, its own take on a helper powered by artificial intelligence. Illustration: Tom's GuideAnd Google Assistant isn't even first app angling to replace Siri as my go-to iPhone helper. Cortana, Microsoft's digital assistant, has been available for iOS devices for more than a year. Downton Abbey doesn't have this much help scurrying about. But which assistant should you turn to for help with everything from sending texts to getting answers for your burning questions? The correct choice seems obvious enough that you wouldn't even need a voice-powered assistant to help you figure it out. Siri is integrated into iOS, so you would think it has the edge over any Johnny-come-lately assistant vying for a space on your iPhone. MORE: 33 Hidden iOS 10 Features You Need to Try And you'd be right for the most part. Siri is extremely convenient, as it's just a Home button press or a "Hey Siri" command away. But Google Assistant for iOS has a few tricks up its virtual sleeve to make the competition closer than you would assume. Here's how Siri, Google Assistant and Cortana measure up as your go-to assistant on the iPhone. Ease of Use Let's start out with the category where it's no contest. Siri is, by far, the easiest to use since Apple integrates it into iOS, and you can summon the assistant from anywhere. Just make a long press on the Home button or say "Hey Siri" — provided you've enabled that feature in Settings — and Apple's built-in assistant springs to life. With Google Assistant and Cortana, you've got to launch those apps before you can ask either one for help. That's an extra step that seemingly negates the convenience of having an assistant on hand. Google Assistant at least throws in a few handy features to make using the app on an iPhone worth your while. When it answers your questions, Google Assistant will also offer up tappable actions that can dive deeper into what you want. (A question about an upcoming Oakland A's game might yield panels that can call up MLB news or the standings.) You can switch to a keyboard for those times you don't want to bark out a request to Google Assistant in public. And Google Assistant ties in rather nicely with other Google apps like Photos and Gmail if you have those on your iPhone. Cortana tries to take on more of a day planner role, with a panel of recommended articles pulled from Bing, the current weather conditions, and an email assistant that alerts you to urgent messages (if you tie-in an email account, that is). Another panel can also show you what traffic's like on your morning commute. As handy as it is to have this information in one place, it seemingly mirrors the Today screen on iOS 10, which I can reach simply by swiping right from my Home screen. Update: There is another way to access Google Assistant and Cortana, though it won't add voice-enabled controls and you'll still have to unlock your phone. You can add a widget for either assistant to the Today screen. Just scroll to the bottom of your Today screen, and tap the edit button: if Cortana or Google Assistant are installed on your phone you can add them to the list of Today screen widgets. Really, both widgets are just glorified shortcuts to accessing the app, but it's better than nothing. Winner: Siri. It's hard to beat an assistant that's immediately accessible when it comes to ease of use. Making Phone Calls Having to dig through your contacts to dial a phone number is drudgery. Better to have an assistant do the grunt work for you, and Siri is tops at this, thanks to its direct line into iOS 10. Tell Siri to call a contact, and the call gets placed immediately. (One complaint: If that contact has both a work and home number, Siri won't always stop to ask you which.) Both Cortana and Google Assistant will dig up phone numbers from your contacts, but you've got to hit the call button yourself to make the call. All three assistants are equally adept at looking up phone numbers such as the number of that nearby pizza place that offers takeout. Only Siri lets you then call with a voice command, though I like the fact that Google Assistant summons up additional information like directions to the place you've just looked up. Winner: Siri. Again, the iOS tie-in gives Apple's assistant the edge. Sending Messages Whether it's sending an email or text, Siri's dominance continues. I could dictate a text message to my wife without ever having to touch — or even unlock — my iPhone. Things get complicated if Siri mishears you and you need to edit the message, but at least Apple's assistant asks you if you're ready to send the text or email before it fires off an error-ridden missive. Google Assistant will happily take dictation on a text message, but you have to tap a button on the screen to send it. It will do the same for mail, provided you've got the Gmail app on your iPhone. I don't — instead I've tied my Gmail account into the built-in Mail app on iOS, but Google Assistant wouldn't take a message there, instead prompting me to download Gmail. Cortana's even less adept with messaging. Ask it to send a text or email, and it will pull up a blank message with the contact filled in, but you've got to do the actual typing. At least, Cortana doesn't require a specific mail client. When I told it to send an email to my wife, it pulled up a message with her contact info filled in — and from my Gmail account no less. (That is when Cortana was able to understand me: three times out of five, it misheard my wife's last name and left the contact info blank.) Winner: Siri. There's no better choice when it comes to hands-free communication. Looking Up Answers At some point during the day, you're going to come up with a burning question you're just dying to answer, but you don't want to endure the vagaries of a web search to find what you're looking for. So which of the assistants available on your iPhone does the best job at tracking down those answers? I asked four questions of each assistant: How many cups are in a pint? What's the longest river in Europe? What day is Christmas on this year? What's the weather like this weekend? Google Assistant was the only one to successfully answer all four questions, though it stumbled a bit when it came to Christmas. (When I phrased the question as "What day is Christmas this year?" Google Assistant told me the date for 2016; only when I rephrased it to "on this year" did Google Assistant produce the right answer. Siri got three of the four questions right, and even threw in a touch of personality on the Christmas question. ("I hope you get the day off," Siri added.) But asking Siri to name the longest river in Europe produced the dreaded "I found something on the web" response where Siri lists a series of search results. Cortana could tell me that the Volga River is the longest in Europe, but was flummoxed about Christmas, asking to see my calendar. Even when I granted permission, it couldn't find anything. Maybe Cortana's just not the celebratory type. Winner: Google Assistant. Google's knowledge graph means fewer virtual shrugs from its digital assistant. Asking Follow-Up Questions Sometimes you don't always get all the information you need with your first question. So how well do Siri, Google Assistant and Cortana deal with follow ups? I asked all three iOS assistants to tell me the score of the Giants game, and all three complied. Then I asked "Who are they playing next?" Siri and Google Assistant dutifully listed the next Giants game on the schedule; Cortana brought up a page of web results, most of which featured upcoming soccer matches. All three assistants also were able to rattle off the stars of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 when I asked. Only Google Assistant, though, successfully listed nearby theaters when I followed up with "Where is it playing?" Siri didn't understand the question; Cortana gave me another list of search results, led off by the definition for "playing." Winner: Google Assistant seems more adept at picking up on the context of your questions, even vaguely worded ones, than the other two assistants. Playing Music We're back in Siri's wheelhouse, at least when it comes to controlling music playback. You can use Siri to play songs, pause them or fast-forward to the next tune, all without ever opening the Music app. Siri can sometimes stumble on song titles — when I asked it to play "Desperado," it thought I wanted to download the 1995 Robert Rodriguez movie as opposed to listening to the Eagles standard. But for the most part, Siri's a great way to access whatever tracks you have stashed in your library. Asking for a song or album in Google Assistant would bring up links to either the Music app or YouTube. Tapping the Music App link would take me to Music, but nothing would play unless I searched for that track in the app. Why even bother with an assistant at that point? As for Cortana, it would either find videos — usually of someone showing you how to play that song on a guitar or keyboard — or links to purchasing that song on Grove or Amazon. Winner: Siri. The other two assistants have no ear for music. Getting Directions Your preference here is likely going to come down to which Maps app you prefer. Ask Siri for directions to a locale, and you'll be given turn-by-turn directions in iOS's Maps. (Funnily enough, asking Cortana for directions takes you to Maps, too.) Google Assistant, on the other hand, will send you to Google Maps, assuming you have that app installed on your phone. Google Assistant seems to do a better job at understanding the names and places of where you want to go. I asked Siri for directions to my daughter's elementary school, which is named after the artist Maya Lin; Siri thought I wanted to go to Myland Park Elementary School, plotting out the 2600-mile journey from my house to Morgantown, West Virginia. Using Google Assistant, I could also summon up alternative directions in Google Maps, like taking a different bridge to reach the San Francisco Airport instead of the Siri-mandated Bay Bridge route. MORE: iOS 10 Maps vs. Google Maps: Which Guides The Best? Winner: Google Assistant recognized my speech more accurately, and the Google Maps tie-in negates Siri's home-field advantage on the iPhone. Making Reservations Ask Siri to book you a table at your favorite and more often than not, you'll get an apologetic message that it can book a table right now. To Siri's credit, it will offer to help you call the restaurant to book the reservation yourself. To Siri's detriment, it has a hard time making sense of difficult restaurant names like the nearby German eatery Speisekammer (which Siri hears as "Spice a Comma). Cortana is even more inept at making dinner reservations, flat out refusing to book a table. If it understands the name of the restaurant, it will bring up an information page where you can place a call to reserve your own table. This is where Google Assistant really shines. I asked to book a table at Café Jolie, and it not only understood my horrible French accent, but walked me through the process of making a reservation using Open Table by asking me how many people were in the party and what time we wanted to eat. Winner: Google Assistant. This isn't even close. Reminders & Events Good news if you want your digital assistant to remind you of tasks, deadlines and to-dos. Siri, Google Assistant and Cortana are all equally up to the task. I told each one to remind me to turn in this story at 10 a.m. And at the appointed hour, reminders from all three assistants popped up on my iPhone's lock screen. (That I didn't file the story on time is something I'd like to blame on them but can't.) All three also do comparable jobs at setting up events on your calendar, though Siri was clever enough to know when I created an event for the first Saturday in June that I meant June 3. (This lack of a specific date flummoxed Cortana.) Google Assistant handled my calendar appointments, too, making them in Google Calendar rather than in the built in Calendar app, so your preference here is likely to come down to which calendar app you prefer. Winner: Siri, but only by the slightest of margins over Google Assistant. Other Actions Last fall's iOS 10 release opened up Siri to more third party apps, and Apple's assistant is the better for it. I can — and have — used Siri to book a ride on Lyft, and I could also ask it to send money to friends through an app like Venmo, start a chat on Skype or start a workout on Runtastic. Apple needs to broaden Siri integration to even more apps, but I suspect we'll hear more about that as soon as June's Worldwide Developer Conference. Google is promising more capabilities for Google Assistant, too, and the biggest coming feature is Google Lens integration. That will allow you to use image recognition capabilities to have the assistant summon up various commands, like buying tickets to a concert when you capture a picture of a concert poster. But that feature hasn't come to Google Assistant just yet. Winner: Siri, though it will be interesting to see how Google Lens-powered feature might change this assessment. Bottom Line As noted when we started, being built and maintained by Apple has its advantages when it comes to digital assistants. You can access Siri at any time on your iPhone as opposed to being forced to launch a specific app, and that's an edge that's difficult for either third-party assistant to overcome. Yet, Google Assistant is nearly up to the task, thanks in large part to its ability to both recognize what you're saying and to put that information in context. I particularly like the way Google Assistant can walk you through tasks like making a dinner reservation or creating a calendar event without throwing up its virtual hands and leaving you all on your own. Siri may be the best choice to act as your iPhone's virtual helper for most tasks, but Google Assistant outshines it in some areas. And hopefully, the arrival of Google Assistant on iOS will push Apple to make some improvements of its own.

An anonymous reader quotes a report from The Guardian: Google argued that it was too financially burdensome and logistically challenging to compile and hand over salary records that the government has requested, sparking a strong rebuke from the U.S. Department of Labor (DoL), which has accused the Silicon Valley firm of underpaying women. Google officials testified in federal court on Friday that it would have to spend up to 500 hours of work and $100,000 to comply with investigators' ongoing demands for wage data that the DoL believes will help explain why the technology corporation appears to be systematically discriminating against women. Noting Google's nearly $28 billion annual income as one of the most profitable companies in the U.S., DoL attorney Ian Eliasoph scoffed at the company's defense, saying, "Google would be able to absorb the cost as easy as a dry kitchen sponge could absorb a single drop of water." business money usa ← You may like to read: → A New Amiga Arrives On the Scene -- the A-EON Amiga X5000 Silicon Valley Investors Call For California To Secede From the US After Trump Win Twitters Says It Will Ban Trump If He Breaks Hate-Speech Rules Twitter Suspends American Far-Right Activists' Accounts Former Engineer Says Uber Is a Nightmare of Sexism; CEO Orders Urgent Investigation When Their Shifts End, Uber Drivers Set Up Camp in Parking Lots Across the US Submission: Accused of Underpaying Women, Google Says It's Too Expensive To Get Wage Data Investigation Demanded Over Fake FCC Comments Submitted By Dead People Accused of Underpaying Women, Google Says It's Too Expensive To Get Wage Data More | Reply Login Accused of Underpaying Women, Google Says It's Too Expensive To Get Wage Data Post Load All Comments  Full  Abbreviated  Hidden /Sea Score: 5 4 3 2 1 0 -1 More | Reply Login   Nickname: Password: Public Terminal Forgot your password?

In this post, we show that men on average do earn about 16.3 percent more than women at Google. But that’s not a complete or fair comparison, as it compares software engineers and marketing associates as if they’re in the same pay bracket. Instead, when we make an apples-to-apples comparison of workers with similar jobs and backgrounds, that 16.3 percent gender pay gap largely disappears. We find an “adjusted” gender pay gap at Google of about 1.6 percent, which is not statistically significantly different from zero. Put differently, there’s no evidence in salaries on Glassdoor of a systematic gender pay gap at Google.

The DoL is now looking for historical information, and wants to interview a wide range of employees throughout the company. This is beyond the usual level of stuff that government contractors have to provide. The DoL claims that this is because they find discrepancies in male/female pay at Google. Now, I have zero knowledge of Google's internal pay practices, but on the face of it, this is extraordinarily unlikely. First of all, the IT industry wage-gap has already been thoroughly debunked: a gap only exists if you deliberately ignore things like years taken off for childcare, which result in less experience and missed promotion opportunities. Second, Google is big enough, and under enough observation, that their HR department will be extraordinarily careful about issues like this. All of which leads me to suspect that there's a hidden motive here. Maybe someone in the DoL is trying to make a name for themselves? Maybe there's a private lawsuit waiting in the wings, hoping for a big settlement? Maybe someone is just hoping to be bought off, possibly via a revolving door?

To summarize briefly, if a particular googler is involved in an extremely successful project, then that googler will get obscenely more money than others, even though they are doing the same kind of work. I don't think this favors men because they are inherently more skilled, harder workers, or even luckier. The two most likely causes are related to gender, however: Willingness to take extreme risks and prioritization of work over life. On that basis, I think has two primary secrets they are trying to conceal here: (1) How they protect losers from failure because they want to encourage risky behaviors. (And even with that insurance, I think women are more risk averse on average.) (2) That work-life balance at the google is really a lie and the company is dominated in every way (including in compensation) by workaholics. The strong incentive pay just makes it look worse and might make the google look more EVIL than it is. If that is possible. Makes me sad how the unbounded love of money turned the good google into such a monster. The motto of today's google: "All your attention are belong to us." The ultimate threat is when people realize that all of the world's information has been prioritized to the BS info the advertisers are paying the google to shove down our throats by abusing our privacy and by raping our personal information. All in a futile quest to solve an unsolvable problem. There is no biggest number and there is no profit that is big enough to "solve" super-greed.

That is why wages stagnate instead of dropping during a bad recession; it would cost money to find out what the new balance of worker supply/demand is. If you go too far you would lose workers; by the time you get that feedback, you've already received the harm. There is no free warning system. Same problem here; wages and worker supply is constantly changing, you'd have to do expensive studies on a continuous basis to ever have this information. No employer does that, and none would. It is just asking too much. Like the summary points out, the actual pay at issue is a tiny amount of money and there is no reason for google to avoid paying it. Which is true; they would certainly prefer to have wage fairness! But they also need to be using a pay system based on perceived merit, so that they have healthy feedback loops. It might actually be better to have government track worker pay across the economy, and provide the wage information that they want businesses to consider in their hiring practices. Each worker is different and has different value, so you need a detailed system to account for what you value in a worker if you're really going to make decisions that would have improved outcomes. It isn't enough to pay based on an underwear check, because the Shapiro-Stiglitz efficiency wage model requires employers to target wages to minimize shirking. In a factory that is easier, but in professional work it requires individualized pay packages. Even if not personalized, you'd need a large number of pay levels that people can be placed at, and so it is effectively the same and will also have the same marginal problems with bias and fairness.

By: Bloomberg | Published: May 27, 2017 6:23 PM Apple Inc. got an early start in artificial intelligence software with the 2011 introduction of Siri, a tool that lets users operate their smartphones with voice commands. (Reuters) Apple Inc. got an early start in artificial intelligence software with the 2011 introduction of Siri, a tool that lets users operate their smartphones with voice commands. Now the electronics giant is bringing artificial intelligence to chips. Apple is working on a processor devoted specifically to AI-related tasks, according to a person familiar with the matter. The chip, known internally as the Apple Neural Engine, would improve the way the company’s devices handle tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence — such as facial recognition and speech recognition, said the person, who requested anonymity discussing a product that hasn’t been made public. Apple declined to comment. Engineers at Apple are racing to catch their peers at Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. in the booming field of artificial intelligence. While Siri gave Apple an early advantage in voice-recognition, competitors have since been more aggressive in deploying AI across their product lines, including Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Home digital assistants. An AI-enabled processor would help Cupertino, California-based Apple integrate more advanced capabilities into devices, particularly cars that drive themselves and gadgets that run augmented reality, the technology that superimposes graphics and other information onto a person’s view of the world. “Two of the areas that Apple is betting its future on require AI,” said Gene Munster, former Apple analyst and co-founder of venture capital firm Loup Ventures. “At the core of augmented reality and self-driving cars is artificial intelligence.” Improved Performance Apple devices currently handle complex artificial intelligence processes with two different chips: the main processor and the graphics chip. The new chip would let Apple offload those tasks onto a dedicated module designed specifically for demanding artificial intelligence processing, allowing Apple to improve battery performance. Should Apple bring the chip out of testing and development, it would follow other semiconductor makers that have already introduced dedicated AI chips. Qualcomm Inc.’s latest Snapdragon chip for smartphones has a module for handling artificial intelligence tasks, while Google announced its first chip, called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), in 2016. That chip worked in Google’s data centers to power search results and image-recognition. At its I/O conference this year, Google announced a new version that will be available to clients of its cloud business. Nvidia Corp. also sells a similar chip to cloud customers. You May Also Like To Watch This: The Apple AI chip is designed to make significant improvements to Apple’s hardware over time, and the company plans to eventually integrate the chip into many of its devices, including the iPhone and iPad, according to the person with knowledge of the matter. Apple has tested prototypes of future iPhones with the chip, the person said, adding that it’s unclear if the component will be ready this year. Apple’s operating systems and software features would integrate with devices that include the chip. For example, Apple has considered offloading facial recognition in the photos application, some parts of speech recognition, and the iPhone’s predictive keyboard to the chip, the person said. Apple also plans to offer developer access to the chip so third-party apps can also offload artificial intelligence-related tasks, the person said. Developer Conference Apple may choose to discuss some of its latest advancements in AI at its annual developer’s conference in June. At the same conference, Apple plans to introduce iOS 11, its new operating system for iPhones and iPads, with an updated user-interface, people with knowledge of the matter said last month. The company is also said to discuss updated laptops with faster chips from Intel Corp. An AI chip would join a growing list of processors that Apple has created in-house. The company began designing its own main processors for the iPhone and iPad in 2010 with the A4 chip. It has since released dedicated processors to power the Apple Watch, the motion sensors across its products, the wireless components inside of its AirPods, and the fingerprint scanner in the MacBook Pro. The company has also tested a chip to run the low-power mode on Mac laptops. In 2015, Bloomberg reported that Apple’s culture of secrecy stymied the iPhone maker’s ability to attract top AI research talent. Since then, Apple has acquired multiple companies with deep ties to artificial intelligence, has begun publishing papers related to AI research, has joined a key research group and has made hires from the field. In October 2016, Apple hired Russ Salakhutdinov from Carnegie Mellon University as its director of AI research. J Jack Smith May 28, 2017 at 5:39 pm Apple has become the vapor ware company and it really saddens me. We hear that Apple will do a self driving car but then nothing. Apple will do a TV streaming service and we get nada! Apple will create their own cloud and even gets a code name of McQueen but nothing produced. Continue spending over 600m a year to use Google cloud and still has a large chunk running on AWS. Apple resorts to leaking something so they do not look so pathetic and we get nothing. I remember when Apple kept things secret and close to the vest and then when it was done and really something surprised us and completely blew us away and then I loved those words and you can buy it today! I have goose bumps right now. This is not my Apple any longer.

Google Maps v9.54 prepares to add saved locations for your school and gym, notification channels, and what looks like a task list [APK Teardown] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/05/26 6:22am PDTMay 26, 2017 41 Plus 1 on G+ 69 Share on Facebook 51 Share on Twitter Total Shares161 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Article Contents 1 Teardown 1.1 Saved locations for School and Gym 1.2 The 'Other' Notification Channel 1.3 A few new prompts 1.4 A task list called "Nearby Need?" 2 Download An update to Google Maps v9.54 began rolling out to users through the beta channel yesterday, but it doesn't appear to have any visible changes going live quite yet. However, a teardown of the apk does bring a few hints about what to expect in the future. There are clues about a couple of new saved destinations like the Home and Work slots that have become so useful, the first stirring of support for Android O's notification channels, a few new "promos" to get people interested in various features, and a very curious feature that might turn out to be a task list of sorts. As usual, we've got a link at the bottom to download this update to sideload if you're not interested in waiting for Google to deliver it to your device. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. Saved locations for School and Gym If you find yourself regularly using the Home and Work saved locations for quick navigation, you'll enjoy this one. The Maps team is expanding the list to include two more common destinations: your gym and your school. <string name="GYM_LOCATION">Gym</string> <string name="SCHOOL_LOCATION">School</string> Since those two strings don't really include any specific telltale signs that they're intended to be default saved locations, I've included the two previously existing lines for Home and Work for comparison. It's pretty obvious that the naming convention matches up. <string name="HOME_LOCATION">Home</string> <string name="WORK_LOCATION">Work</string> There is also a newly added icon for education, which I would naturally assume will go with the School destination. There doesn't appear to be a similar icon dedicated to the Gym slot, but it's not as if Google can't easily color-fill the existing fitness icon. Nevertheless, this one missing icon might be a hint that Google won't make these new destination slots available until a future update includes the missing icon. These two new entries will obviously operate just like Home and Work for the purposes of navigation and quick route selection. And as always, users don't have to actually link these slots to real schools or gyms. I'm sure a lot of people will welcome this simple improvement because so many of us travel to more than just work and home in a typical day. The 'Other' Notification Channel I'll just make a quick mention of this topic since it's not really that interesting. Google Maps is going to have a notification channel on Android O titled "Other notifications." <string name="OTHER_NOTIFICATION_CHANNEL">Other notifications</string> I doubt this will be the only custom channel for Maps. After all, there are several subsections in Settings dedicated to each notification type, so we'll probably see the channel list grow a fair amount in the future. I would assume the Maps team is still trying to decide how to best organize the app's notifications. This "other" channel will probably become a placeholder for most of the notifications until they are organized into suitable channels. A few new prompts I normally skip changes that are meant to advertise existing features, but sometimes the focus of banners and notifications can give a little insight into the features and apps that may not be performing as well as expected or simply need user awareness. The latest Maps update includes three new promos. The first banner is for the Google Trips app. Launched around this time last year, Trips is basically an itinerary management app that's also intended for making local recommendations. Trips probably doesn't have a very substantial user base yet, so it's not hard to imagine why Google is trying to breathe a little more life into it. code <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_TITLE">Take your travel info with you</string> <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_TITLE_WITH_AREA_NAME">Take your %1$s travel info with you</string> <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_BODY">Reservations • Things to do • Day plans</string> <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_DOWNLOAD_LINK">Get Google Trips app</string> <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_DISMISS_LINK">No thanks</string> The next addition is intended to get users to try out the recently launched location sharing feature. It's pretty normal to show prompts to get users only newly released features, so there's nothing unusual about this one, but you can probably expect to see it in your navigation setup soon. code <string name="CAR_TI TLE_JOURNEY_SHARING">Share journey</string> <string name="JOURNEY_SHARING_PENDING_PROMPT_TEXT">Share your trip with %1$s</string> <string name="JOURNEY_SHARING_PENDING_PROMPT_TTS">Sharing your real-time location with %1$s until you arrive.</string> <string name="CAR_MENU_START_JOURNEY_SHARING">Share journey</string> <string name="CAR_MENU_STOP_JOURNEY_SHARING">Stop sharing</string> The final promotional banner will belong to the always familiar Local Guides program. As usual, it's going to encourage users to contribute to Maps for points. The one interesting oddity is that these strings have "v2" in their names. It's possible this just means they are for a new set of promos, or this might hint at a revised version of the points program. I would expect the former, but it's at least worth acknowledging the latter is possible. code <string name="POINTS_V2_PROMO_TITLE">Reach new Local Guides levels</string> <string name="POINTS_V2_PROMO_TEXT">Now earn more points for your reviews, photos, edits, and adding new places.</string> <string name="POINTS_V2_PROMO_GOTO_STATS">SEE YOUR LEVEL</string> <string name="POINTS_V2_PROMO_OPEN_HELP">Learn more</string> A task list called "Nearby Need?" There's very little to go on for this topic, but it looks just weird enough that I suspect there's a feature brewing in there somewhere. A pair of new layouts were added with the name "nearby need," one of which defines the look of a list, and the other is for items in that list. There is also a single string with a related name and just the word "navigate" for text. <string name="NEARBY_NEED_NAVIGATE">Navigate</string> /layout/nearby_need_item.xml /layout/nearby_need.xml Based on this very limited amount of information, it does sound a little like a shopping list of sorts. Perhaps less like a grocery list and more like a list of chores or tasks – e.g. getting new tires on the car, picking up some materials for a weekend project, and buying new clothes. I would assume each item goes into a list and Google Maps will make it easy to navigate to the next nearest place where each of these things can be taken care of. I'm not actually sure if these are related, but there are also three new images to be found in the resources, and they certainly would fit with my theory. The first is for creating new tasks, the second is for completed tasks, and the final one is for "old" completed tasks. I suppose the old one might be for things a user did on previous days but hasn't removed from the list. This is all guesswork right now, but many people have been asking for ways to use Maps to get through chores, and this feels like the first hint of something like that. The one aspect that's not yet hinted at, but I certainly hope to see, is a feature that will sort tasks efficiently so people can choose the shortest (or fastest) route to get everything done. I'll keep watching and follow up when there are more developments.

They are used when you go to Your Contributions -> Check the Facts/Uncover Missing info. I think after all this time those two are still only for lvl 5 local guides... so yeah. Cody Toombs Right, the look of the images aren't new, but the files containing those images are. Or said more clearly, there are now multiple copies of those icons. mmark27 I sure would like there to be a "Work" and then a "Parking for Work" section for those that don't park right next to their office. Point being, if I want walking direction/estimations, give them from my office. If I want driving directions/estimations on time, know that I have to walk to my car, then drive from my parking location. The School addition will be good to finally have pop up automatically now though. Cody Toombs If you're not going to use all four slots for their intended purpose, you might just assign one of the others to be your work parking. Frankly, I would have liked these saved slots to have custom labels, since some people don't fit into this one shape. For example, I know somebody that has to travel to two different sites for the same job, and another friend that was enrolled in two different schools at the same time. It's not like one of these destinations can't go into the "Gym" slot, but it would be nice if the titles could make sense. mmark27 Right. I now have my "Work" location saved as my parking lot, which is silly, but it's the only way to get decent estimations. Your fix is what I'll be doing otherwise unless they fix it. The subtly though in this situation is El Goog knowing that the Work and Work Parking are linked existentially, so they can decipher where my body is and estimate from there, etc. Same can be said for Home and Home Parking if not directly on site. Would seem like Google's apartment-city-dwelling-first mentality would be more amenable to this off the bat. I agree that we should be able to have free labels on places and also as many places as we can stomach estimations/notifications on time to. Google knows where I am at all times....make it actually useful, guys. henleyb I work from home and Google would keep asking me to set my work address which is of course the same as my home address, it was a small but annoying thing. :) Cody Toombs I hated that for years. I've been working from home in one capacity or another for more than a decade and it took far too long to see Maps lighten up on having a different Work address. Austin Spangrud Sure would be nice if maps got integrated assistant into it. None of the commands and home commands that I have integrate with the Voice button in maps. Oh and In b4 where's my speed limit pop up Cody Toombs Speed limits are still limited geographically. Since I was in the Bay Area last week, I finally saw them pop up for the first time on my phone and in Android Auto. Funny enough, I now have a Speed Limit toggle in settings on one phone, but nowhere else :/ And now I'm probably not going to see the speed limits again for a long time. Paul_Werner Yeah and we used to have them and they disappeared. At least it did for me here in the Milwaukee, WI area. Same for when I travel to Chicago Nicholas Matranga Finally, it was so annoying to have to save my school address as my work address just to get commute updates. mike shwilly Grow up Maxr1998 Had to do the same, I'm very glad they implement this option now that I will have finished school in less then a month... (And haven't visited it for anything except a few exam-days since late April..) Hamilton Jimenez Vasquez Finally, Im glad that we can save more pinned-saved choices other than the usual Home and Work, although I would prefer to customize them on my own in the same manner we customize the saved list. I could make a really good use of few in my mind like Church, Work2, University, etc. Jon Xuereb Couldn't you use this school one for University Hamilton Jimenez Vasquez I used the word University just an example, the point is that it would be great to customize those pinned saves using our own creations. Taylor Hardy I work from comfort and ease of my property or home, through doing easy gigs that only takes from you a Computer and web connection and I am also joyful than before... After six months time in this project and also i got made in sum 36,000 usd... Basically I make near 80 bucks/hr and work for three to four hours every day.And excellent point relating to this work is that you can easily handle time and effort while you work and for how long as you prefer and you generate a paycheck per week........ learn by clicking here how to do it right now Paul_Werner I can't wait to see that "nearby need" implemented. Your guesswork on it sounds like it could be a really useful feature. h4rr4r Why are these static names? Why can't I add random strings and assign them saved locations? Ken Vincent what ever happened to speed limits? I thought that was on the verge of being a thing more then a year ago. UKTK8 "In the coming weeks" Meaning whenever Google d#$% well pleases. Jon Xuereb Lawyers I'm assuming dmo580 Yet Waze and other GPS apps have no issues. How about just displaying my current speed? Ken Vincent Not only that, but google provides speed limits as a service. I would imagine that is where Waze gets their speed limit info. https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/roads/speed-limits Jon Xuereb Because Google Maps is exponentially larger in terms of user base, and google is a bigger target for lawsuits Ken Vincent Waze is wholly owned by Google. They are not even an Alphabet company, they are Google. Jon Xuereb Still the size of the userbase affects the their risk assessment icyhotmike why not just let us add "Saved" locations such as Home and Work and whatever else we want? Damn Google in control of everything. makapav My God the Google apps and ecosystem are becoming such a clusterfuck with no sources of truth for data points. All the information is spread across random places. Richard Oldroyd I do use home a lot but for the others like gym I save as a contact and nav just as quick. Richard Oldroyd I'd love maps to display my current speed and advise what the speed limit is. Obviously they would have to add a warning saying they can not be held responsible for displaying an incorrect speed limit. I'd also like to see us be able to choose what is displayed underneath where they show destination time and miles to go, it would be useful to see arrival times at all stops not just the one you are currently naving to.

Google Phone v10 enables post-call messages for failed calls, prepares for enhanced incoming calls on RCS and voicemail backup [APK Teardown + Download] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/05/23 1:19pm PDTMay 23, 2017 61 Plus 1 on G+ 111 Share on Facebook 54 Share on Twitter Total Shares226 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Article Contents 1 What's New 1.1 Post-call messages 2 Teardown 2.1 RCS Calling 2.2 Voicemail Backup 3 Download With the dust settling after the deluge caused by I/O 2017, it's time to take a closer look at some of the many other things that came with out last week. Some interesting changes came with a brand new version of the Google Phone app included with Android O Developer Preview 2. There's a new prompt suggesting users send a message after a call fails to connect. A deep dive into the apk also turned up signs that Google is working on new RCS calling features and preparing some kind of backup option for voicemail. What's New Unofficial Changelog: (the stuff we found) Post-call messaging Post-call messages Earlier this month, a teardown of of v9 provided a good hint that the Phone app would begin showing suggestions for messages to send after completing a call. With v10, that feature is now live, but not quite as functional as previously expected. Left: snackbar prompt. Right: new message screen. The post-call messaging feature appears as a snackbar prompt asking why you called, to which you can send a message. The prompt only appears after attempting a call that fails without making a connection. To be specific, the prompt won't show up if you hang up, a voicemail service answers, or anything else occurs that would be considered a connection. Basically, if you hear a sound indicating the other end is ringing, any outcome from that point on is probably not going to trigger the prompt. You're most likely to see this prompt in an area where cellular reception isn't good enough to establish a voice call, but you can also force it to show up by trying to make a call while airplane mode is active. Otherwise, it's probably not going to turn up anywhere else. If you opt to send a message, you'll be taken to a screen with a message box and three pre-written messages with different levels of urgency. Tapping a message will put it into the textbox below, but you can continue to make edits before sending. The exact text of the prompt seems to be a mismatch for the current functionality, which left us wondering if this feature is also intended to work in other scenarios like when the call is redirected to voicemail or disconnects within a second of being picked up. Perhaps this is just the first step and other use cases will be handled in the future. In the meantime, this actually might be handy if you're in the middle of nowhere and staring at a single signal bar with no hope of making a call. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. RCS Calling It's no secret that Google is working to add fairly extensive RCS support to both its Phone app and Android Messages. Now it's just a matter of which features are going to be added and when we'll get to use some of them. This update to the Phone app gives us a bit more insight into some new rich calling features that we'll soon have at our disposal. A stack of new notification strings reveal that Google's developers are currently working on supporting incoming calls with additional data. At this time, it's clear calls can include a location, photo, message, or any combination of those. One line also mentions "attachments," which may suggest other types of data are supported, but not necessarily known in advance. This would make sense for things like URLs or specially crafted data packets can be handed off between other apps. It's also worth noting that these strings are split up for regular and "important" calls, which lines up with the commonly known feature allowing callers to indicate a degree of urgency. code <string name="important_notification_incoming_call_attachments">Important incoming call with attachments</string> <string name="important_notification_incoming_call_with_location">Important incoming call with location</string> <string name="important_notification_incoming_call_with_message">Important incoming call with message</string> <string name="important_notification_incoming_call_with_message_location">Important incoming call with message and location</string> <string name="important_notification_incoming_call_with_photo">Important incoming call with photo</string> <string name="important_notification_incoming_call_with_photo_location">Important incoming call with photo and location</string> <string name="important_notification_incoming_call_with_photo_message">Important incoming call with photo and message</string> <string name="important_notification_incoming_call_with_photo_message_location">Important incoming call with photo, message and location</string> <string name="notification_incoming_call_attachments">Incoming call with attachments</string> <string name="notification_incoming_call_with_location">Incoming call with location</string> <string name="notification_incoming_call_with_message">Incoming call with message</string> <string name="notification_incoming_call_with_message_location">Incoming call with message and location</string> <string name="notification_incoming_call_with_photo">Incoming call with photo</string> <string name="notification_incoming_call_with_photo_location">Incoming call with photo and location</string> <string name="notification_incoming_call_with_photo_message">Incoming call with photo and message</string> <string name="notification_incoming_call_with_photo_message_location">Incoming call with photo, message and location</string> It's not yet clear if attachments will be shown on the screen with incoming calls, but I think it's a pretty safe bet that they will be. After all, knowing there's a photo with the call isn't nearly as compelling as actually seeing it. This was part of the pitch for the Knock Knock feature when Google introduced the Duo app at last year's I/O keynote. The same certainly can be said about locations and messages, as well. So far, there doesn't appear to be an interface for callers to actually attach this type of data, so it's safe to say development is still ongoing. Seeing as most carriers are still stuck on very rudimentary implementations of RCS and intra-network compatibility is moving at a sloth-like pace, I'm sure Google will have this done long before any of us would get to use it. Voicemail Backup Are you the type of person that never deletes voicemails? This one might be for you. It seems that Google will begin asking users if they want to turn on "extra storage" when their voicemail inbox fills its capacity. This allows Google to "manage and backup your voicemail messages" to free up some space. code <string name="voicemail_error_inbox_almost_full_turn_archive_on_title">Turn on extra storage and backup</string> <string name="voicemail_error_inbox_almost_full_turn_archive_on_message">Your mailbox is almost full. To free up space, turn on extra storage so Google can manage and backup your voicemail messages.</string> <string name="voicemail_error_inbox_full_turn_archive_on_title">Turn on extra storage and backup</string> <string name="voicemail_error_inbox_full_turn_archive_on_message">Your mailbox is full. To free up space, turn on extra storage so Google can manage and backup your voicemail messages.</string> <string name="voicemail_action_turn_archive_on">Turn on</string> <string name="voicemail_action_dimiss">No Thanks</string> At this point, I should say that there are a few different things this could be, and I'm at a loss for which one it is. For starters, this could be a new aspect for Project Fi subscribers and the included voicemail service. If so, it might mean Google intends to prompt people with a lot of saved voicemails to push the older ones into their Drive storage. It's a simple explanation, and might be an attempt to squeeze a few bucks out of people that never delete anything, but hardly seems necessary. Another possibility is that this only relates to the voicemails downloaded and stored on your phone, which means it's just a basic housekeeping feature to keep unnecessary audio files out of your local storage or expand the quota to allow for more. I tend to doubt this is the explanation because the text doesn't really line up with that purpose and it seems like the type of thing that should happen automatically, users shouldn't even need to be prompted. Finally, I'm going to take the opportunity to speculate about something a little crazy. Perhaps this is intended for the voicemail service provided by other carriers. If this is the case, I imagine the phone app might detect your voicemail is nearing capacity and offer to manage backups of it. If the user agrees, Google will connect to that provider's voicemail and proceed to back up all of the messages to Drive for the user, then delete them to free up space. Again, this is massively speculative and feels like a long shot... But it's also the type of weirdly cool feature Google occasionally comes up with. There's not much else to go on with this, but it's entirely possible this feature / warning / error message is already live. It may only show up for users connecting to a specific carrier or with special circumstances that aren't very predictable. I'm not really the right person to test it since I only have three voicemails saved, but perhaps readers with a larger backlog will have something to add to this. Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way. Rather than wait for Google to push this download to your devices, which can take days, download and install it just like any other APK.

Carson Saldanha They were mistaken. Artem Russakovskii Which feature specifically? Pedram Haghzaban This post-call messages for failed calls Duder12 Voicemail features will never matter since carriers don't allow them in the US. Prop Dad I use this app for VM. What features don't matter? Richard Riker strange. minsdk is 23, target is 25. Won't install on N (app is not compatible) even when i'm running v9 already. Any dependancy update needed? because no problem with clock from the preview Carson Saldanha Just to confirm, you're trying to sideload it on a Nexus/Pixel device, right? Artem Russakovskii Are you on arm64? Richard Riker uh...totally overseen that. Corey Kinard Is there any way auto post-call spam messages, sent from (detected) spam callers, could be auto blocked and deleted the same way they plan on doing with the verification codes?

John Unfortunately, many features don't work on the patched version. There are older official versions available for non-Nexus devices at apkmirror. Version 9.something is the latest. We will likely never see an official version. Previous official versions that work on non-Nexus phones were mistakes that were pulled. Samsung and others modify their dialers so that Google Phone doesn't work well unless the stock apps are disabled which may require root. Carlos Rodríguez Midly related, but SMS backups are coming to Nexus devices on O. If you toggle the switch of and on in Settings > System > Backup, a new option for SMS backup appears, just like on the Pixel. Cheers! Lynxy Dear lord, you're right! I'll try to test that the next time I reset the phone while on O. Alex I don't see that option. Nexus 6P in the UK. Latest O version. Carlos Rodríguez In phone settings > system > backup, turn off the switch for backup in Google Drive, then turn it back on. You'll see the SMS backup like on the Pixel. Alex Hmm, that requires deleting what's already backed up. I think I'll skip this until it is rolled out properly. Thanks for the help though. Carlos Rodríguez Yes, deletes the backup, but makes a new one as soon you turn it on. No loss of data actually. Fayas Android O on Nexus 5X. can't see that option to backup SMS. Carlos Rodríguez It only appeared for me when I turned backup off and on. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/6e53aa283e8271597b15df245154ecc06126d368853b89fa516c6076dbf49ac2.jpg Fayas Thanks, I got it after turning off and on back. But it shows me as waiting to back up for SMS and Call Log. Don't know why. Carlos Rodríguez It will eventually back up the SMS. The call log is stil waiting. James Well according to Google's implementation of the omtp visual voicemail standard (https://source.android.com/devices/tech/config/voicemail) it's vvm client "Fetches details of voicemail quota (total mailbox size and occupied size)" from the carrier so it's probably for carriers that have implemented the stock omtp vvm standard like t-mobile. James Briano Tangentially related: Anyone else getting errors with the phone app on Dev Preview 2? App keeps crashing when I have an incoming call. Nexus 6P. Cody Toombs I haven't put the SIM card into my 6P for more than a couple of minutes since the developer previews started going on there, so I can't comment to that exact scenario, but it has been working perfectly on my Pixel running 7.1.2. I've had pretty regular issues with Google apps crashing on DP1 and DP2. It may be a coincidence, but it seems especially bad for any app that uses hardware components like GPS and cellular radio. I'm not complaining since we all should know the deal with bleeding edge releases, but I think the O developer previews have been the buggiest I've used since Google started with KitKat. Andy J "It's not yet clear if attachments will be shown on the screen with incoming calls, but I think it's a pretty safe bet that they will be." Yes - yes it is. All the stuff people are left wondering about is covered in a LOT of depth in the Universal Profile spec - in this particular case, selecting a photo to be shown on the receivers screen when the phone call comes in - is specifically detailed in the spec. It's worth also being aware that as it's also specifically in the spec that the phone book must expose which contacts support Universal Profile - that I'd expect both the contacts app and the dialer app to be opened up to all devices on the Play Store before too much longer - otherwise only Messages supports RCS and people will have phones where they can't actually tell if they can make a video call or send someone a file (or their location) - all they can do is send them a message. Santos Chavez Perhaps the next step is including Google Phone, Android Messages and Google Contacts preloaded on most phones-- some manufacturers have already pledged to include Android Messages as the sole default app so they may expand it to those apps, too, who knows. In the meantime current devices will be able to download the Google dialer and contact apps from the playstore for full RCS capabilities. Like some already have to do for Android Messages currently. mike shwilly Can i just have Swipe to Delete sms feature? Manikandan Guru Working fine on my OP3T. aRvInD Instead of this pretty useless idea, I wish Google places Redial button in same place. Which more people will find relevant and useful... hp-fourtwenty double tap the dial button to redial. tap it once to see the last number dialed. aRvInD No you misunderstood context. I wrote about redial only with call doesn't connect or failed without connecting.. After call disconnects then open dialer - double tap dialer, Simple button there to redial wouldve been great.. F4LL0U7 It's really frustrating that with all of these enhancements, there STILL isn't a way to use your Google Voice number by default instead of your carrier number. You can set the option to place all calls through GV, but if I try to send an SMS follow-up to a rejected call, or send an SMS through Assistant, it still uses the carrier number. Santos Chavez Yeah, I'm hoping for better Voice integration now that Google's revived it. Especially on the sending SMS part; why not have an option of at least routing all SMS through the Google Voice app (which can be done by setting it as the default SMS app, an option that doesn't exist currently). When that is enabled, any background SMS are also sent via that app, for instance when using Assistant. You'd think a Google service would be tightly integrated at the OS level with the whole OS, especially on phones in which Google has full software and hardware control. no? :P I mean, Project Fi is somewhat integrated into the OS, and it uses the same backend as Google Voice... and even then it's not perfect integration either.

[Update: Now $75 Off] Deal Alert: Pixel 32GB (international version) is $50 off on eBay Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/05/26 2:20pm PDTMay 26, 2017 2 Plus 1 on G+ 53 Share on Facebook 57 Share on Twitter Total Shares112 Deals News Pixel Update 1: 2017/05/26 2:32pm PDT It looks like the price has dropped another $25, making this a $75 savings in total. For a device that hasn't seen much in the way of price drops or It's no secret that Google has had some serious supply issues with its flagship Pixel phone. That goes for pretty much any combination of size, color, or storage. Rumors even began to surface alleging that Google had stopped production of the devices altogether. That wasn't the case, but nonetheless, you will still struggle to actually find the Pixel if you wish to buy it. A 32GB Pixel (international version) on eBay for $50 off the list price could be the answer to that problem. This is the entry level 5" Pixel, with 32GB of storage in the color Very Silver - and it's available for $599. That's $50 less than the $649 Google is still charging for it. Beware though, this is the international version of the device. So if you live in the US you'll have to check the bands to see if it works on your network. This version won't play nice with Verizon or Sprint, so if you're on either of those carriers you can rule this out. If you live outside the US then this is definitely for you. Shipping appears to be free in the US, but here in the UK, it's $18.99. That still works out a bargain for me, especially if you account for the exchange rate. You'll have to do the sums from where you are to see if the deal is as good for you. It's worth mentioning that getting your warranty honored might be tough with this type of purchase, so bear that in mind. It's hard to say how many of these they have, other than a "limited quantity," so you'll have to be quick if you want to get your hands on arguably the best Android phone of 2016. Update 1: 2017/05/26 2:32pm PDT It looks like the price has dropped another $25, making this a $75 savings in total. For a device that hasn't seen much in the way of price drops or sales since launch, $75 off isn't bad. Anyone interested in a Pixel that uses a network compatible with this international model should give it a serious think.

Middlefinger As a back up phone yeah, its not reliable enough to be a daily driver. Its problems seem to be a mixture of hardware bugs, and Googles poor software QC. me me "bargain" JL "buggy" Gladysrcrosby Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job. Even everyone not used to this, can make $89/per h easily and the earnings can go even higher over time...

It doesnt matter how 'high end' a device is, if it doesn't work properly, its worthless. jonzey231 $50 is worth a guarantee that Google will honor the warranty....trust me...I wish I would've gotten my 6P direct. Andy What do you mean? jonzey231 If you don't buy the phone from Google, they won't help you. They send you to the manufacturer. I was forced to go to Huawei for my 6P and it was a little over 3 weeks before I got it back....and the problem is still there. Spend the extra $50 and buy it through Google so you're guaranteed to get support through their CS channels. You'll be glad you did in 6 months when something inevitably goes wrong. IMHO get the OnePlus 3T. Costs less but has better overall specs aside from the camera which is still pretty good in its own right. My brother has one and my roommate just got his last week and they both have no intention of going back to a major brand ever again. YaKillaCJ Same happened when I got the OnePlus One. It changed the way I (and many others) view a "budget" device from an unknown brand. needa I felt the same way after using an OPO for nearly three years. Got me an XL in mint condition for $450. Google edition even. Still had 3520 mAh in the batt too. Would have bought the black 3T had they been in stock. Took me three days to hunt down this deal. Andy Got my wife the pixel. Runs great. Just had the microphone problem. Google swapped without question. Wife seems to think it takes horrible selfies. Rod Weird, as it's cameras are regarded among the best currently. Random! @andy maybe you should let her know that the camera isn't the problem... It's actually her face. If you do warn her about this, I promise to visit you at the hospital. Andy Thanks for the tip. VAVAMk_2 Huzzah! Master Yates Agreed with you regarding the 3T. Lets see if the excellent updates and support evaporate when the One Plus 5 is released? That's the real test. IcerC Except in this case Google is the Manufacturer, that might change things. VAVAMk_2 Google didn't make the camera. Uses a Sony made sensor but the camera software is Google's and regarded among the best in post processing, particularly HDR. Roy Ahh so nice call me when the 1+2 will get Nougat and your friend will get or never get Android O. ddevito #Fail Andy S8 release response? AdMoc Does not ship to Poland as fck always -_- Random! Look for some service like Shipito. I believe they have an EU warehouse. Shakil Shaikh $60 shipping? kristin ANY Pixel made by google is compatible with any provider. It doesnt matter if its international or not. This writer is an odiot. Scott Scrivens https://www.techwalls.com/google-pixel-pixel-xl-model-number-differences/ Kevin Davis "Odiot", lmao. 😂 Oh, and you're wrong, too. kristin I called google about this. It would be up your phone company provider whether it worked or not. So it may not work with att or tmobile either. kristin This may or may not work on any provider. Its up to the provider. You want a pixel? Go to swappa.com and get one used in mint condition for much cheaper. Ive gotten a few phones from them since ive been on project fi and had no issues. Ill never buy a new phone again. Random! $50 off? How cute... If they get to $300 off ($350 final price) within a month, I might even convince myself it's worth to stare at those bezels everyday. Other than that (impossible) scenario, I'd rather get the 3T, Axon 7, or even the LG G5. Gjorgi Lazarovski The Pixel is probably not dropping in price anytime soon. iKon The most overrated smartphone of 2016. Only the camera is decent. Ugly ass design, overpriced and dull with no features compared to competition Roy You mean the best smartphone of 2016, best camera rare band front, best software, best updates. Great battery, great display. xyz No, he means "The most overrated smartphone of 2016. Only the camera is decent. Ugly ass design, overpriced and dull with no features compared to competition." Roy No, I'm sure he/she means "the best smartphone of 2016, best camera rare band front, best software, best updates. Great battery, great display". iKon No I meant what I said. The pixel is a flop and even Google knows it. No matter how much money they put into advertising there are alot of better choices out there.. only hard core Google fanboys try and big it up Roy Yes yada yada and still every reviewer said is the best smartphone of 2016. So.. even David here. In the on of the day it's a lots about the UI and I just don't like Samsung software. Ordeith LOL. You're such a Google sycophant, Roy. Roy You feeling really smart? I'm Imagine your ass all over your face. nirmitlamed Google is so off track in figuring out what customers wants and competing against the other monstrous companies. I would very much like to hear how many Pixels Google sold in the last year since they told us they sold more than they expected. Lawrence I can put my coffee cup on the Bezel David Nowicki I'm a big Nexus fan, but why would you pay $749 for the Pixel XL vs the OnePlus 3T at about half the price ? And soon the OnePlus 5 at $450 or so with S8+ specs will be a steal compared to the Pixel 4Ui812 Supply and demand. Limit the supply and you increase demand. It's like P.T. Barnum said , "There's a sucker born every minute".

Google argued that it was too financially burdensome and logistically challenging to compile and hand over salary records that the government has requested, sparking a strong rebuke from the US Department of Labor (DoL), which has accused the Silicon Valley firm of underpaying women.  Google officials testified in federal court on Friday that it would have to spend up to 500 hours of work and $100,000 to comply with investigators’ ongoing demands for wage data that the DoL believes will help explain why the technology corporation appears to be systematically discriminating against women. Noting Google’s nearly $28bn annual income as one of the most profitable companies in the US, DoL attorney Ian Eliasoph scoffed at the company’s defense, saying, “Google would be able to absorb the cost as easy as a dry kitchen sponge could absorb a single drop of water.” The tense exchanges in a small San Francisco courtroom emerged in the final day of testimony in the most high-profile government trial to date surrounding the intensifying debate about the wage gap and gender discrimination in the tech industry. The DoL first publicly accused Google of “systemic compensation disparities” during a hearing in April, saying a preliminary inquiry had found that the Mountain View tech firm underpays women across positions. The current court battle stems from the DoL’s lawsuit filed against Google in January, accusing the company of violating federal laws by refusing to provide salary history and contact information of employees as part of a government audit. As a federal contractor, Google is required to comply with equal opportunity laws and allow investigators to review records. Labor officials have said they uncovered pay disparities in a 2015 snapshot of salaries and that investigators needed an earlier snapshot and compensation history of the employees to better understand the wage gap. The agency has also argued that it needs contact information of employees so it can conduct confidential interviews.  “This is obviously a very time-consuming and burdensome project,” said Lisa Barnett Sween, one of Google’s attorneys, claiming that the company has already worked 2,300 hours at a cost of nearly $500,000 to partially comply with the government’s demands, which she argued were broad and unconstitutional. “Our courts must act to check this abuse of power.” Google has vehemently denied the claims that it underpays women, claiming that it has closed its gender pay gap globally and that in the US it provides equal pay across races. Google has also argued that the DoL’s data request would violate the privacy of employees and fourth amendment rights against unreasonable search and seizure. In one revealing exchange, Frank Wagner, the company’s director of compensation, admitted in court that if women are paid less than men in the same positions, those salary disparities can persist even if the employees perform at the same level. Asked about a hypothetical, Wagner explained that if a female employee starts at a lower salary than a male colleague in the same job at Google, she may continue to make less even if they both excel in their first year and score the same on evaluations. Wagner claimed that eventually, their wages would likely be adjusted to match each other: “There would be convergence over time.” Eliasoph, the DoL attorney, said that it was outrageous for Google to argue that historical salary data was irrelevant to the government’s audit, considering it is widely understood that discriminatory wages lead to continued disparities as women advance in their careers. “This claim requires putting one’s head in the sand with respect to 30 years of law on pay discrimination.” Kristin Zmrhal, Google’s senior legal operations manager, also testified that the process of compiling data for the DoL has required engineers, lawyers and employees across departments to build new systems, conduct extensive quality reviews of files, redact documents and complete other complex tasks. “It became too burdensome,” she said, noting Google was forced to hire a third-party vendor to help. “The team was bogged down.” Eliasoph pointed out that Google has consistently earned millions in lucrative government contracts and has recently announced “with great public fanfare” that it invested $150m in diversity initiatives. “Google cannot claim ... that it now has no money to comply with a federal agency seeking to ensure compliance with equal opportunity laws on behalf of the public.” He also claimed that Google, with more than 21,000 employees, was trying to present itself as “too big to comply” and that the company should not be able to skirt anti-discrimination laws just because it is large and has a complex compensation model: “Google takes routine requests and makes them sound onerous by emphasizing the number of people involved.”  Sween asserted that Google has complied with the “overwhelming majority” of the government’s demands, adding, “The agency has little if any regard for the fourth amendment rights of its contractors.” Earlier this month, the tech firm’s lawyers also unsuccessfully argued that the case should be dismissed altogether, claiming that a DoL official may have violated ethics rules by talking to the Guardian about the federal investigation. In that interview in April, regional solicitor Janet Herold said that the initial data suggested that “discrimination against women in Google is quite extreme, even in this industry”. Surveys have repeatedly found that women are often paid less than men for the same jobs across Silicon Valley. An account of sexual harassment at Uber earlier this year has also sparked a widespread debate about misogyny and misconduct in tech. Google is one of three powerful Silicon Valley firms to face DoL lawsuits related to discrimination claims over the last year.  Go to MSN Home Go to MSN News Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

Jide Remix Mini Android Desktop PC Review: Interesting Software Let Down By Bargain-Bin Hardware Michael Crider Follow View All Posts 2015/12/19 9:00am PDTDec 19, 2015 79 Plus 1 on G+ 35 Share on Facebook 0 Share on Twitter Total Shares114 News Reviews Article Contents 1 Specs 1.1 Hardware 1.2 Software 1.3 Applications 1.4 Performance 1.5 Conclusion Android is many things. A mobile operating system, a tool for smart watches and set-top boxes, and much more. But one of the things it most certainly is not is a desktop OS... at least in its current form. That said, it's also the world's biggest piece of open-source software, so when Jide decided to make what it calls "the world's first true Android PC," they were more than free to do so. Whether or not it's a good idea is a subject for discussion... and this review. Specs Processor 1.2GHz quad-core Allwinner A53 RAM 2GB Storage 16GB, MicroSD card slot Wireless Wi-Fi b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.0 Battery AC Adapter OS Android 5.1 Dimensions 124 x 88 x 26mm Price $69.99 Colors Black Buy Amazon With the Remix Mini, you get a tiny Roku-sized box that, at least technically, works like a desktop PC. Plug in a monitor or television via the standard HDMI port, add a mouse and keyboard (either via USB or Bluetooth), connect it to the Internet via Wi-Fi or a standard Ethernet port, and you're good to go. And as odd an idea as an Android-powered desktop might seem like on the surface, the Remix Mini manages to be much more than the sum of its figurative parts, thanks to some impressive work on the software. Jide has successfully adapted Android into a keyboard-and-mouse interface, or at least much more of one than any previous attempts, like ASUS' Transformer tablets. Unfortunately, the Remix Mini is almost exactly the sum of its literal parts - even for its super-cheap $70 price tag, the performance is objectively terrible. It might do for a guest machine or a somewhat underpowered set-top box... but unfortunately, there are other devices that fill both roles effectively, for comparable prices. Hardware The Remix Mini looks quite a lot like a Roku. Or a Nexus Player, or an Amazon Fire TV, or any of the other vaguely interchangeable hockey pucks that hide behind your TV. The difference is that this one is intended to act like a desktop computer. Around back are an HDMI port, two standard USB ports, a headphone/microphone jack (though audio through HDMI works as well), a MicroSD card slot, and a proprietary power port. There's no power button on the device, at least not at first glance. The printed logo on the top hides a capacitive button - just tap it to power the gadget on or off. Other than that, it's extremely nondescript. You can hide it behind a desk or monitor (with a little tape - there's no mounting solution), or even slip it in a pocket for travelling. You'll have to fill the other pocket with the power and HDMI cords, and since you're bringing a bag for the mouse and keyboard, you might as well put it all in there. Crack open the plastic and you'll find specifications that completely fail to wow. The Remix Mini is based on a 1.2GHz quad-core 64-bit SoC from Allwinner - not the most auspicious start. There are two models advertised on Jide's site, one with just 1GB of RAM and 8GB of storage, and the other with 2GB and 16GB, respectively. The only one being sold on Amazon is the latter, for $69.99, and it's the one we were sent to review. You'll also get Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Ethernet support. Even for the low price, the specs are underwhelming. With no battery, screen, mobile radio, et cetera, I would have expected some of the more core specs to be better. I understand that Jide was going for the absolute smallest price possible, but it comes at the cost of performance - more on that later. Software Remix OS is what Android would be if you tried to turn it into a PC with a mouse and keyboard UI. And considering that the developers needed to tweak or rewrite very nearly everything at the core of the operating system, it's actually quite impressive. Remix's interface runs on top of Android 5.1, and despite some of the extreme changes, includes full access to the Google Play Store and other Google services. The desktop is, well, a desktop. It's an impressive copy of most of the paradigms that Windows users will be familiar with. Windows is definitely the template here, not OS X, any flavor of Linux, or even Chrome, with the main "start" button on the lower-left corner, a taskbar full of currently-running apps, and a set of tools in the lower-right. Each Android app opens as its own window, which can be dragged around, resized, and generally messed with in a familiar way. My Microsoft keyboard and mouse set played nice with the UI; the Windows key opened the start menu, most of the familiar keyboard shortcuts worked, even the semi-proprietary media controls were functional. Windows can be opened and closed in the usual way, and apps downloaded from the Play Store work as you'd expect them to. Up to a point, anyway - obviously the transition from a touchscreen UI to mouse and keyboard has a few hiccups. Starting up Remix OS for the first time is a bit of a chore. My review unit immediately needed a software update, which took the better part of two hours. And if you have a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse ready and waiting, you might need to grab something else: there's no way to connect Bluetooth accessories before the initial setup for Remix and Google's services, so you must have a USB mouse at the very least. Once you start to actually use the device, everything sort of falls into place. You might almost believe you were using a heavily-skinned version of Google's Chrome OS, but Remix has the advantage of access to the full complement of Play Store apps. Resizing and repositioning, including fullscreen view, is possible in every app. That said, the apps usually launch in their ideal forms (usually utilizing a tablet interface), and manually resizing them is awkward and often results in worse use of space. The intersection between the windowed apps and the total desktop UI can be awkward as well - for instance, clicking the "fullscreen" button in the YouTube app will make the video extend to the edges of the window, but then you have to click the fullscreen button on the window itself to see the video as large as possible. Clicking on the hamburger menu on the far right of the taskbar will open up the notifications in a fashion very similar to Windows 10, though you also get a peek at them as they come in, Lollipop-style. The desktop UI doesn't lend itself well to widgets, which is probably why you can't put any on the main screen - if you want to see them, you'll have to click the Start button, then click the Widgets button, at which point an OS X-style screen used only for the widgets will appear. A final note: at the moment Remix works only at resolutions of 720p or 1080p. That's fine if you're planning on using the Remix Mini with a TV or a cheap monitor, but if you have a 16:10 or 4:3 ratio screen, the image will be stretched out with no real fix. Applications Remix includes only a few apps by default: the Play Store, Play Movies, Docs, Sheets, Slides, Gmail, and Chrome from Google, plus customized versions of a calculator, download manager, file explorer, Settings menu, a user feedback tool, and the aforementioned Widgets screen. There's also an app called simply "RAR" that can compress or decompress files. Other than that, you'll be getting everything from the Play Store or from manual APK installations, even some ubiquitous apps like YouTube and Netflix. And this kind of works, if only because Jide seems to have intentionally made the core operating system as minimalist as possible. Though Remix OS is not too difficult to get into, the usual mishmash of manufacturer bloatware wouldn't help. Performance The Remix Mini runs like its trying to swim through molasses on a high-gravity planet. It's not the only problem with the relatively novel hardware and software, but it's definitely the deal-breaker for me. Just getting Chrome to open a page can be a pain, and just about every action on the device takes several seconds to complete. Video is jittery with errors in sound playback (so forget about using this as a media player), and high-end games simply will not run. Even simple games like 2048 stutter and chug. And keep in mind, this is on the better of the two configurations, with 2GB of RAM - I can only assume that the 1GB version is much worse. The focus on an interface that's more complex than standard Android, and is designed to allow reasonable multi-tasking, is probably the reason for this slow performance. And I don't want to be too hard on the Remix Mini, since it is offering a combination of hardware and software that's fairly unique. But the fact remains that this kind of performance would be damning even for a budget phone, to say nothing of something that bills itself as a desktop PC alternative. Conclusion The Remix Mini is cool. It's like a Raspberry Pi for people (like me) who couldn't program their way through a decoder ring cypher. And Jide deserves points for their software, which expands Android in ways that simply can't be found on any other product. But unfortunately, that software still has a lot of little kinks to work out before it feels like a "real" desktop OS. And on top of that, the bargain bin hardware inside the Remix Mini makes it screech to a halt when it's trying to do, well, pretty much anything. If you're looking for a sub-$100 desktop, you'd be better served by a Chrome-powered gadget like the Asus Chromebit. If you're looking for a set-top box, any of the various Roku designs is an easy pick. If you want a tiny Android-powered desktop machine, you might want to check out Jide's products... in another year or two. The Remix Mini is simply too unfinished and too underpowered to recommend.

Tomasz Kucza For me it would also need a full browser. Mobile Chrome is very limited. sproc $150 can net you a decent win10 box. Problem is, it is win10 :) -Matoro Zeliph- I like the software interface. This is what it should be like when connecting your android phone to a dock and monitor. Eh well, maybe we'll get that someday. Kawshik Ahmed Actually Motorola had such technology called Webtop which turned Android phones into Desktop like OS when connected into a dock. Google removed Webtop after they bought Motorola. Google shouldn't have done this the technology would have improved much by now. Motorola had desktop and laptop dock before MS Continuum -Matoro Zeliph- Yeah. It's a shame. Daniel Marcus Unfortunately, WebTop was removed well before Google bought Motorola Mobility. Roh_Mish The laptop part actually make for a good Raspberry Pi terminal. I have seen a few people using it online. Aabhas I must say, RpiB2 with a preloaded sd card works very well. Only if someone could optimize the remix Android for that. Ubuntu Mate works fine. Android, being lighter, should work much faster. ethd Remix OS would perform worse on a Raspberry Pi 2 than on this. I'm not just being intentionally difficult, either: This Remix Mini has better hardware in every aspect as compared to the Raspberry Pi 2 and still doesn't work well. I think you don't realize just how incredibly lightweight Ubuntu MATE is, even compared to Android. I’jaaz Tello Well, yeah, Android use compiled code and seems to have memory issues. Something that most of Linux doesn't have an issue with. I mean, I ran a box that had ChromeOS + Ubuntu running side by side on 1 gig of ram and 16 gigs of solid state. It worked just fine ethd Not to sound like a jerk, but I don't think you totally understand what you're talking about. Linux uses code compiled ahead of time and has practically since the beginning. Since Lollipop, Android does too. The memory leak issue is definitely real though. I’jaaz Tello You do sound like a jerk. But yes, I do know. I said compiled as in compiled ahead of time.... Lemme quote myself, I said "compiled code" as in past tense code. I do understand how confusing that could sound, but I did mean "compiled" code. Because that is what happens to the code. The runtime compiler stuff is long gone. What I meant was that programmers might have a better understanding of how memory was allocated if they used C to program their applications. As in, what certain programmers do on Linux. I’jaaz Tello Duh!! Brain fart there. Yeah, me knows all that. I've actually compiled some code me self. But the code is more low level, right? I was pretty sure (I could be wrong) that C had more memory allocation control than Java.... Again, dunno what I was thinking. I must have been half asleep. I mean, I compile things on Linux all the time, and I know that Lollipop finally made that happen. Though the main thing I like about Linux is that I can run something like Arch that gives me more control over what runs as a process. That really makes things snappy, y'know? Though you're right about the memory leaks. That's the biggest bummer. Oh, and the crappy skins certain manufacturers put on android. ethd It's true that code in C is lower level, but it's also worth noting that there's nothing stopping developers from using C or C++ on Android, and in fact many game developers do. Java is just an order of magnitude easier than those two languages, especially for apps simpler than games. Michael Carr Part of Android's heft and relative sluggishness in real-world usage comes from the Google apps. They've been getting heavier over the last few years, and phones that were speedy 12 months ago can feel slower now with the same (fully-updated) list of installed apps. ethd The great thing about Remix OS is that it doesn't let any app run in the background by default, including Google's. You have to explicitly enable it. But on the flipside, that means that this computer's shoddy performance isn't because of Google's apps. OhLongJohnson Many of the Amazon reviews point out they were Kickstarter backers. Even if this isn't a power house, I am glad to see a project actually be completed and shipped out to backers. David Onter Yes, there were no delays at all. There was the Kickstarter campaign which I supported and I got my Remix last month, just like announced. ethd This is disappointing, but I kinda expected this. An Allwinner 1.2GHz 64-bit SoC seemed like a recipe for horrible performance - I'm sure it's the CPU more than anything that is causing such disappointing performance. I've been running Jide's official Remix OS on my Nexus 10 for the past few months and it's pretty awesome. I still kinda want to give this a try despite its lousy performance. Tomasz Kucza It may also be flash. Slow flash can kill any device's performance. ethd True enough. I remember my old (now broken and discarded) Nexus 7 2012 with fantastic SoC performance with its Tegra 3 and utterly horrible flash performance that made the device unusable when it was, for example, installing updates from Google Play. Joeyfrombklyn And a fast stable internet connection, I would think help things move a little smoother. ethd It would help Internet-related stuff of course, but it doesn't sound like a lot of the flaws of the Remix Mini are caused by a bad or mediocre connection. Joeyfrombklyn Yes correct, I was struck by the authors complaint of web pages loading painfully slow and thought about hearing people bitch about devices being slow and a lot of times it can be a slow internet connection. Best. Jfb. David Onter The flash is quite fast, installing Apps is very quick (quicker than on my HTC One M8). Slowpoke Allwinner? I thought they were dead. It's even worse than a MediaTek. Still, the UI seems excellent, and it looks very familiar for a Windows 10 user. someone755 Quite honestly I was impressed by the UI from the screenshots. The disappointment came when I read "Allwinner" for the first time in my life though, and it only went downhill from there. I expected a price this low to pack more punch, since most bells and whistles are removed from its phone/tablet counterpart (most notably the display, mobile radios, and various buttons and sensors), but this kind of performance couldn't justify 20€ in my book.

Rolo Nieves MediaTek SoCs at least works decently, but Allwinner... F**k. Faheem Ahmed no gps,gyrsoscope.compass Daniel Marcus Interestingly, that sort of UI is not as rare as you might think. I just got a Cube T8 which is backed by a MediaTek processor. It includes a very similar windowing feature, and the processor on this tablet seems to handle it just fine. Alexander Trust It might be and older version of Remix OS because Cube is one of Remix' partners, cf. http://www.jide.com/en/remixos/devices Daniel Marcus Oh, you might be right! I have the Cube T8. Good to see Teclast on there too. Cube and Teclast are both great budget tablet OEMs. TedPhillips remixOS has been on my todo list check out for a while. they seem to have the best 'productivity' implementation of android so far. iirc their tablet was much more powerful, tegra 4 maybe? need to look into if there is any device i already have i can put it on. probably not though. seems like an adt-1 might be a good fit for a sup'ed up remix desktop, though. TedPhillips remind me, did AP do a review on the Jide Ultra (tablet)? Sebastian Gorgon that software is what Chrome OS needs to be, it's what Pixel C was born to run. TedPhillips i agree, gut check would be that they should offer a build for pixel C owners. beat google to the punch on their own hardware. Niels There are already builds available for Nexus 10 and Nexus 9 (http://www.jide.com/en/remixos/devices), so a build for Pixel C is a real possibility. I don't know how unlockable Pixel C's bootloader is though, is it as easy as a Nexus? Roh_Mish Pixel devices were easy to unlock till now. C should be easy to unlock too Deckard_Cain When I select the individual screenshots on this article, the image doesn't zoom in. Increase the resolution so we can see better the screenshots! Caleb Escamilla IV been rocking the remix mini for over a month and a half and yes the softwear is jittery at times but the company is one that actually listen to its end users and is working on updating the softwear as quickly as the can. They truly understand that with out the end users feed back there nothing. I believe that this mini Android PC is going to become an amazing product and would recommend it to anyone willing to be on the edge of technology and willing to send feed back at stress test to the Jedi team to look at and fix Mi II Lo To me that's a big problem Caleb, people more willing to bitch about spending $60 on what in essence is an experimental device and being disappointed; instead of going straight to customer support with the issue and then calmly waiting for a resolution. Jide has answered my 5 issues (only two relate to a device issue) within what I thought was a reasonable time. One device Issue was fixed with the second patch update before I got a written response! So yeah I spent $100 on two of the 2gb devices and both are working good for me. I am also involved in the community because I am hoping it succeeds! Omar F. Rodriguez Morales Mmm maybe this device was ment for regular use like checking social media, emails and so, not anything pretty demanding, i would definitely use like a kiosk just to show a web app using chrome browser Joeyfrombklyn Agreed I think that's what this is meant for, at this point in time, with a fast stable internet connection it should serve people well enough to do the basics. David Onter It is. Just watch some interviews, etc. Their slogan is also "Finally, less can be more". Omar F. Rodriguez Morales It's not a beast like the nvidia shield, maybe it's in the same level with the nexus player, I like NP for the TV although, this could be a good distraction if I really really need a mouse and a keyboard Tsun_Pooka I like that the interface is really similar to Windows 10, and that's impressive on an Android setup. Is there any way to get Remix OS as a dual boot with Windows 10 then? Joeyfrombklyn I have to agree for the most part concerning performance, but for some on tight budgets this may be a viable option for light web browsing, email, I think the concept is fantastic and as others have commented the UI looks very nice, hopefully someone will ( get it ) and get the hardware a bit more robust 1st one to market will sell a shit ton of them. Paul Maybe it's the review kit you have but I don't have any issues playing catch up video or live streaming from my own DLNA box, Google Movies, NOW TV and YouTube (Play Music doesn't work but they are working on a fix for that. Between my Chromecast (which is being used only for Play Music now) and my Remix Mini I have a great media player device. It is hooked up to my TV and works brilliantly far better than I expected, it's hidden out the way, goes to sleep when not in use a simple move of the mouse wakes it up. I bought two of these via the KickStarter project. Gave one to my mother and she loves it, got to grips with it right away as she has an android phone so 99% of it works the same just on a bigger screen (also helps when she has a tech issue I know how to help her out). For basic stuff like email, web browsing (yes a desktop chrome browser would be nice) playing music, listening to the radio, watching tv and movies it's a great little device and hasn't slowed down once for me even when using multiple windows, for example I have used WPS Office and a browser for research, while listening to YouTube music playlists and having email open I didn't see any issues at all. And not forgetting it's very portable so on away trips I simply plug it into the hotels TV HDMI and I have everything as if at home. EzequielBruni Ok, right now I'm using my laptop to run a pseudo-smart TV. While this might not be a great production desktop, do ya'll think it could run a TV just fine? The desktop interface works from me. I need to use it with a VPN, and also want to stream games from my desktop a la Steam In-home streaming. (Yay for the ethernet port!) Think it would work for all of that? David Onter Nah, keep your laptop. bpcooper14 Fill disclosure. I am one of the kickstarter backers. In my experience with the month I have used the mini, I've been impressed with the updates to address some of the issues users have encountered. I think I've gotten 3 updates thus far. Is it a powerhouse desktop replacement? Nope. I've been able to watch movies, browser the web, work within Microsoft documents, and lite gaming. For the $40 I paid, I got my monies worth and it will continue to improve. Version 2 will no doubt address complement concerns people might have. Great first effort in my opinion. Faheem Ahmed wish they launch a launcher in playstore @androidpolice David Onter Running several apps in windows at the same time is not just a launcher... Faheem Ahmed BUT MAN LOOK AT BRIGHT SIDE....HAVE U USED FIREFOXOS DE FOR ANDORID..ITS A LAUNCHER!! @FIREFOX Faheem Ahmed NO VGA,NO TEGRAX1,NO OPENSOUSCE larry9 I love the concept and it sounds like the software part of this product is very sound. Often a "new concept" product is introduced on very capable hardware, soon followed by a budget version. It seems they could now fairly quickly launch the more capable version. For twice the hardware cost the performance should be way way better. David Onter I also received mine a few weeks ago and was honestly suprised by how decent it is software-wise. The hardware on the other hand is pretty bad. The SoC costs 5$, is advertised as "the most cost-efficient 64bit-chipset on the market" and gets a score of 21363 on AnTuTu. The performance is overall alright, even if some glitches have to be expected. I also noticed that the audio chip the Mini uses is really bad (probably the built-in one), even though there's an "output raw audio signal"-option in the settings which I haven't tested yet. If somebody is curious which version of Android is underneath of Remix OS 2.0, it's Android 5.1. I'm not a native speaker and writing longer texts is a pain for me, so I'll write some more things as a list: *) The "RAR" app that is preinstalled is simply the compression app by WinRar from the Play Store which can be installed on about every device. *) The Mini is supposed to support 4k too, but it currently doesn't reliably work. Jide is working with Allwinner on an Update that should address this. *) Jide's support is great and they're normaly very direct. They also have an own forum and regulary ask questions/involve the community in the development on their social channels. *) There have been no informations concerning root or custom development so far, but at least Allwinner isn't known for their dev support. We'll see. *) The company Jide-Tech is a Chinese-based startup founded by 3 Ex-Googlers. *) Jide has forshadowed that they're working on a "Pro"-model several times and are already asking on Facebook what people would expect from it. Gaurav Arora I think their next hardware model will be the one to look out for! Alex Lees I ordered the 2GB model from Kickstarter. Got charged €19 for customs. Probably wouldn't have bought if that was the case although it does state customs charges may apply. I'm selling mine, I haven't even opened it. They sent it with a european adapter even though I asked them to change it for a UK one, they refused. The UK plug was added as an option after I'd pledged so I originally chose European. Lord_Santa If Jide have any sense, they will port Remix OS 2.0 to the Pixel C. Zan Zac Zac I have exactly the same version. i think that performance-wise it is what i had expected. I have installed Kodi and popcorn time and they work flawlessly. Even 1080p does not stutter. The processor does its job for the purpose i bought it for. Which is not 3d gaming or other power user tasks. In my opinion, with the excellent support taken into consideration, it is worth it. wuafri I already use Android OS. as a dekstop with Vysor . Andrew M. Sheppard You just save me 12.00. I was going to purchase another copy of VMLite's VNC Viewer. I'd rather support Koush. Thanks! Mi II Lo I got to say I just did not have the troubles you did Michael. I mean I understand that it is not all they said it would be, and I admit I was hoping for better, but in my usage I have not come across all the lag and other troubles you are pointing out in your piece. Having said that, the forum has plenty of complaints about many things you wrote about, but just as many folks offering workarounds or other solutions. Jide is still pumping fixes and many would say they did rush out their product before it was fully baked. This is their initial offering however and if they can fix everything for everyone and upgrade their device then this should be very promising! There is also plenty of folks posting apps that work great and peripherals that are working. So as with all new devices and UI's mileage will vary! Said Tahsin Dane This customized Android OS would be a great fit for a cheap laptop. erick just get an intel/windows10 based pc/hdmi stick for the real deal. quad core Pentium with HD/4K graphics. Christopher Holly the only issue that I have had, was that the Kickstart unit I got, the capacitive button doesn't work. Sigh. Waiting still on RMA...But the unit works and seems to be totally usable, cruddy processor or not. It will hang occasionally, but my experience with using it for web browsing has been fairly positive. The OS is really usable for the desktop, compared to simply using the Android OS with HID. Gary Deezy I wonder how this would compare to the $100 intel compute sticks with 2GB of RAM and Win10? Tony i have a problem, when i try to reproduce videos on youtube app or instagram even in the main repro de os crash... help. sorry for my english Gugman ...so forget about using this as a media player... now that is a very bold statement, as I just watched mkv file from usb, nba game at 60fps around 5gb big with no issues at all, using Kodi as a player Titus C I do not care who the builder of the hardware is, remix mini works better as a 'smart' addition to my old plasma TV and now is more usable than my new Samsung Smart TV. I only use use Remix mini for reading emails and browsing and watching video streaming either from hbogo, youtube or my Synology nas located at my office (through DS video) and all of them work flawlessly. So for me is perfectly ok as is. Would have liked widgets - at least usual ones like clock and weather just to make the desktop a bit more friendly but not a big deal that they are mising.

The most significant thing about the handset is that it runs on Android O. The listing the phone on Geekbench suggests that it will be a regular variant of Google's 2016 flagship. As you can see from the image, the model has managed to bag 1631 points on the single-core test, while it has received 3876 on the multi-core test. As we know, the average Google Pixel with Android Nougat scores more than 4000 points on the multi-core test. Also Read: Set of things you can do with Google Play Music Google recently announced the Android O at its I/O 2017 developer conference. During the announcement, Google claimed that the successor of Android Nougat will be more useful and deliver Fluid Experiences with features including Picture-in-picture, Notification Dots, Autofill with Google, and Smart Text Selection. Additionally, Android O will also come with TensorFlow Lite tech, some pertinent security enhancements, new developer tools, and a new programming language. Now, coming back to the Google Pixel phone, other features are still the same. This means that it comes equipped with a Snapdragon 821 chipset along with 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM. Android O will likely launch later this year, and we are assuming that it could feature with the upcoming Google Pixel 2. Rumors have it that it will be officially called the Android 8.0 Oreo. It will be made available first to Nexus and Pixel devices. It will then gradually make its way to other Android handsets from the different brands.

Google is now offering four free months of Google Play Music for new subscribers Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/26 2:17pm PDTMay 26, 2017 82 Plus 1 on G+ 614 Share on Facebook 102 Share on Twitter Total Shares798 Google News Right now it looks like Google is running a special offer for Google Play Music. New subscribers that sign up here can get four free months of service instead of the usual three. No telling how long this offer might last, so if you have been considering subscribing, now might be the time to do it. It could save you an extra $10. Again, this particular offer is only for new subscribers. I've been a fan of Play Music for a long time, though the device removal limit does get in the way when you switch between devices and ROMs as often as I do. Being able to mix your own library with those of a service also comes in handy. That way I can continue to support artists I am passionate about, without eschewing the larger selection of a subscription offering for the purposes of content discovery, all while being able to fill the gaps in that library. There are a lot of different music services out there, but if you're interested combining your curated library with music available via a subscription, then your options are limited. Spotify does allow you to play back locally stored files, which is convenient, but it isn't quite the same. Amazon also allows you to upload your music for playback via Amazon Music, and with Amazon Prime membership, you get a small library of streaming music to go along with that. For $10 a month ($8 for Prime members) you can access their full library as well. But, Google Play Music has a great interface and plugs nicely into all the other Google services we love. Maybe with this new offer, it's time you gave Google Play Music a chance? After all, even if it doesn't end up working out, you still got four free months of music out of the deal.

Carson Saldanha Wait, wdym 3 different countries? Did you share it with others or something? Ailín Ó’S I live in Ireland, so that's my main account. I have a secondary account based in England as part of a mail forwarder service I use, and my bf is Greek so I had him check the code on his account :) Carson Saldanha Oh wow! Carson Saldanha Hey, since I know it worked for you, are you able to use YouTube Red along with this Play Music free trial? Because my YT Red doesn't seem to be enabled for me. Ailín Ó’S No, unfortunately not as I live in the EU and YouTube Red is only available in USA. Carson Saldanha Weird, I'm in the US though. Ailín Ó’S Ooh that is odd. Sign out of the app then sign back in maybe? Carson Saldanha No luck :( I'm in contact with Google support atm Hopefully they can sort this out Mike Worth it alone for Youtube Red MisterAlex Sweet, I wasn't sure if that was included. Thanks. Should mention that in the main blog post. Ben Still no student membership >:( Ailín Ó’S Spotify is a great alternative @€$£5/month. Ben I know that's what I use just because it's half the price. Ailín Ó’S In Ireland Vodafone have a partnership with Spotify whereby it costs €5 standard instead of €10 regardless of if you're a student or not, they even bundle it with some of their plans. Vodafone do the same in some other countries they operate in (not all). Maybe see if any network in your country has a partnership like that? Worth a shot! Ben Oh yeah I'm on EE in the UK and I've got Apple Music for free for 6 months but like iTunes is a massive stinking turd. Ailín Ó’S I'd rather go back to the days of getting music via Bluetooth from friends than use crApple Music 😂😂 Rahul Krishna In india, we have play music for 1.4 usd/month Umang Ladia I'm only seeing 2 months offer in India.?? Rahul Krishna Well I subscribed to it when it launched here (about 2 months ago), so I can't confirm that. But at this price, there is nothing to be disappointed about. aRvInD I wish Spotify launches soon here. I can't keep using that patched version here...!! Rahul Krishna Me too xyz As it should be, you can't charge European or American prices in India. Rahul Krishna Yes true. There are lots​ of people here with a very cheap Android phone. They cannot pay much money. Julian Coronado That's actually what's keeping me away from Play Music. I've used my free months and I loved the Youtube Red too. But as a student, Spotify for $5 / month is too great to pass up on. Emiliejmosley Google is paying 97$ per hour! Work for few hours & have longer with friends and family! !sm141c: On tuesday I got a great new Land Rover Range Rover from having earned $8752 this last four weeks..

Cakefish Spotify ftw ToniCipriani ✓pǝᴉɟᴉɹǝʌ I don't think this is a new offer, got this a while back. In fact my 4 months is expiring next week. Prefer Spotify over it. Song selection a tad bit weaker, and for foreign songs it tries to translate the song names to English and makes it hard to look up. folkrav I like it, it's way cheaper than Spotify for me - my mother, my sister, my wife and myself each pay 30$ a year and we're set - but Jesus do I hate the clients. I don't like the website's interface, I hate the Android app. But yeah, I'll deal with it cause it's cheap, I guess. Carson Saldanha Got it! Yay! Jim I wish I could somehow get it on my Amazon Echo hahaha. I guess if I had paid for a Google Home it would be worth trying out. Forget vega #getEVGA Why google play music isn't available in my country ? Ailín Ó’S Try Apple Music? They seem to be just about everywhere. Iamsecond And this is why Apple continue to dominate, because Apple are truly interested in being an international company whereas Google is just playing at it. Such a shame xyz Because Google sucks. Bartek Juszczak My GPM radio's are so good these days I love that Google is so into AI. Whether It's just "I'm being lucky" or radio from a specific song, band or album they very rarely disappoint me these days. I just make sure to thumbs up if it plays a song I particularly love. I am a student and could go cheaper with spotify but the AI generated playlists have me locked in. If it's £5 cheaper but I'm not gonna enjoy it nearly as much then it's not really a good deal. AndTheWorldMayNeverKnow I used the 3 or 4 months free trial during the holidays then bought the family plan for $14.99 a month. 4 people in my family us it and it works great, the app could use some tweaks but it's really good overall. paev If you listen to main stream music it doesn't really matter what service to use. However, if you like something unusual, weird or other languages then Google is a way to go. I found bands on Google music that Spotify displayed as not found. Google also have new synth bands that Spotify doesn't. I'm for Google too. Daniel I discovered that GPM is kinda like a music label. I once went to a section of Google play explaining how indie artists can use GPM like a music label as long as they own all their rights. Ryne Hager Ultraista (among others) keeps me using Google Play Music as well as Spotify. Carson Saldanha Does anyone else who activated the Play Music trial have YouTube Red working as well? My YT Red doesn't seem to be enabled while my Play Music is. Michael Carr I spotted a similar offer a couple of months ago, and I took it after a day or two's thought. Just last week, I moved directly into a family plan. PewPewYoureDead It's hard to recommend Google Play Music until they revamp the UI. Margaritas Ante Porcos Google Music is the only choice in some markets, like Russia, where no Spotify or Pandora are available. There are too many shortcomings in Google Music and Google never shows interest in making services better than below average. I really wonder why Google refuses to become the best at anything. Real magic here. Pixel syndrome all the way. Yet Google Music is on my phone and I use it because there's no choice whatsoever. Rob You answered your own question. If there's no alternative, then they don't have any incentive to improve the service. SupahNin10doh Stupid Dorito logo... Raymond Berger Huh, I just subscribed to the trial but you youtube red hasn't kicked in yet. Any idea how long it takes? Iamsecond If you live in the UK, about 2 years so far h20ray Google Play Music is currently available in select territories and for select account types. Umang Ladia I'm only seeing 2 months offer in India, anybody can confirm? Mohammad Ovais Yeah, same for me. Maybe it's region limited. Isolde I think you need to open the link in a browser, if you open it in the app it's just the normal 2 months. bligui Confirmed need to open it from link and it works Manoj | Blogging Triggers Is Google Music really worth to it? We have better alternatives Sathiya Moorthy Karan I came across a great post, it seems to be so cool http://developeit.net/android-news-image-scanner-finder/ Zachariah Mann It only shows up as 2 free months for me. I live in Michigan. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a19b7e9dddb67bf897c751aedf63c01917048214140db901fd783b2182d8d5c0.png Jefferson Rodrigues https://play.google.com/music/listen?coupon=120DFREE&coupontype=vanity#/sulp Zachariah Mann That link still brought me to the same page on the Play Music App which offers 2 months free. Does it matter if I'm opening it on a computer or web page? Jefferson Rodrigues I don't know. Mikael Jakobsson Should mabye joine premium at Google Music if that coste like $2 max a month dont understand why they should take as mutch as someone some has app or Win32 software to PC so music controllers one they keyboards works. Tab out frome a game for pause music when the round is over is just bad. Arif Gürü And stil isnt available on Turkey xyz "No telling how long this offer might last, so if you have been considering subscribing, now might be the time to do it." No thanks, I'll just use YouTube. Only thing YT needs is an option to play audio only so I can save a wee bit more data when I don't need video. Cai Copley Nope. If it wasn't for the fact work pays for Spotify Premium and the fact Spotify has Crossfade to emulate a DJ system, maybe I'd give it a whirl. bligui Not working any more to bad Follow Android Police 1.49M 472k 145k 119k Latest Deals 9 [Deal Alert] Chromecast Ultra is $59.99 ($10 off) at Google Store, Best Buy, B&H and others 2017/06/04 12:16pm PDTJun 4, 2017 13 [Deal Alert] Google Home is $109 ($20 off) at Best Buy, Google Store, B&H, and others 2017/06/04 10:07am PDTJun 4, 2017 12 [Deal Alert] Kick off the weekend with 24 temporarily free and 52 on-sale apps 2017/06/03 6:50pm PDTJun 3, 2017 18 [Deal Alert] Get a Nextbit Robin for $129.99 on eBay 2017/06/03 9:39am PDTJun 3, 2017 33 [Deal Alert] A Stork's Journey is currently free on Google Play Movies & TV 2017/06/01 10:50pm PDTJun 1, 2017 Latest Poll How many photos are on your Google Photos account?

With its sensing, mapping, and localization capabilities, the Google Tango platform has a lot of promise for robotics. Here’s an update on some of what Google has been working on with it: And here’s the talk that Johnny Lee from the Tango project gave at Google I/O earlier this month. [ Google Tango ] Flyability’s Elios drone has the ability to fly almost anywhere thanks to the clever design of its roll cage. It’s already been deep down inside glaciers, so the next logical place to send it is a cave: Flyability took part in the scientific expedition (ref article from ESA) organized by the La Venta Association and Commissione Grotte Eugenio Boegan, together with the European Space Agency and astronaut Luca Parmitano, in the La Cucchiara caves near Sciacca, Sicily. Part of ESA’s Cooperative Adventure for Valuing and Exercising human behavior and performance Skills course (CAVES-X1), this expedition was primarily meant to train astronauts in an environment replicating extraterrestrial conditions. It has also been the opportunity to deploy Elios in extreme conditions by performing the exploration of an underground abyss. The known part of the cave consists of a gallery that ends in a 100 m deep abyss. This is as far as humans could go in the exploration and that’s where the collision-tolerant drone was used to continue the journey. With an ambient temperature of 37°C, 100% of humidity and continuous rain from condensation, the Flyability team joining the expedition operated the drone to find potential unexplored paths. Using Elios’ thermal camera to detect hidden hot air sources, the team could very quickly and clearly identify openings of various size. [ Flyability ] via [ ESA ] Thanks Adrien! You should probably not try this with your robot: [ Denso Robotics ] Evezor is a SCARA-type robot arm designed to be able to automate tasks using any tool you decide to strap to it: It’s a compelling vision, certainly, but the early bird price is over $3,000, and the project is looking for $250k. If you know this is for you, you’ll probably jump on it, but it’s a big investment for most makers. [ Evezor ] via [ BBG ] One of the desires with robotic systems is to devise easier ways to setup and program the robots. One potential approach to setup is known as “Programming by Demonstration” in which a human trainer demonstrates the task to the robot, and from that demonstration the robot learns the task which can be performed. During her summer internship at Fetch Robotics, Sarah Elliott worked on a web-based programming by demonstration system for the Fetch. [ Fetch Robotics ] Drone behemoth DJI continues to outdo itself with the launch of Spark, a very compact camera drone with a range of autonomous capabilities, including obstacle sensing, hand-gesture recognition, and pre-programmed flight behaviors like following and circling: One of the most impressive things is that you get all this for just $500. [ DJI ] Introducing Daisy, an 18-DOF hexapod walking robot built from X-Series modular actuators. This robot is now on display the the Chicago Museum of Science and Industry as part of their Robot Revolution exhibit. [ Hebi Robotics ] via [ CMU RI ] I’m not sure that I need my toy racecars to make snarky comments (I do just fine on my own, thank you very much), but the amount of sensing and actuation in Sphero’s latest toy is impressive: The car will run at up to 10 km/h, make it 40 minutes on a charge, and there are all kinds of moves and sounds that you can control with an app. But along with all of that intelligence and sensing and actuation comes a price to match: the toy is now on sale for $300. [ Sphero ] Security robots certainly have value, but the bad guys can probably outrun most of them. That’s not a problem for the O-R3, a security ground robot that can deploy an untethered drone to pursue a suspect: [ Otsaw ] via [ Engadget ] Sweep, the alarmingly affordable high quality lidar sensor from Scanse, is now available with an add-on kit that lets you take 3D scans of very large areas: The kit is $350, and the lidar itself isn’t included. But you have one on pre-order already anyway, right? [ Scanse ] Thanks Tyson! Lockheed Martin successfully launched Vector Hawk, a small, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), on command from the Marlin MK2 autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) during a cross-domain command and control event hosted by the U.S. Navy. In addition to Marlin and Vector Hawk, the Submaran, an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) developed by Ocean Aero, provided surface reconnaissance and surveillance. During the Annual Navy Technology Exercise (ANTX) activities in August, the Submaran relayed instructions to Marlin from a ground control station via underwater acoustic communications. Following these instructions, the Marlin launched the Vector Hawk using a specially-designed canister from the surface of the Narragansett Bay. Following launch, Vector Hawk successfully assumed a mission flight track. All three autonomous vehicles—Marlin, Submaran and Vector Hawk—communicated operational status to the ground control station to maintain situational awareness and provide a means to command and control all assets. The four-pound Vector Hawk can fly for 70-plus minutes, at line-of-sight ranges up to 15 kilometers. Operators can recover and re-launch the Vector Hawk in a matter of minutes (including changing the system’s battery). Vector Hawk is built on an open architecture to enable rapid technology insertion and payload integration. Marlin MK2 is a battery powered, fully autonomous underwater vehicle that is 10 feet long with a 250 pound payload capacity, 18-24 hour endurance, depth rating of 1000 feet and weighs approximately 2,000 pounds. [ Lockheed Martin ] Scientists at Scuola Sant’Anna in Italy and EPFL (Ecole polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne) in Switzerland have built a prototype of a smart, light-weight and easy-to-personalize exoskeleton that counteracts the loss of balance and promotes balance recovery after an accidental slip. This is a first in wearable machines, which are normally used to assist or enhance regular movement, instead of preventing an unexpected event like falling. [ EPFL ] The EduExo is a robotic exoskeleton kit that you assemble and program yourself. It contains the hardware that you need to build an elbow exoskeleton. An accompanying handbook contains a tutorial that will guide you through the different assembly steps. In addition, the handbook provides background information on exoskeleton history, functionality and technology. In the end, you will have a good understanding about exoskeleton technology and its application, together with hands-on experience building and programming your own robotic exoskeleton. The Kickstarter is already funded, but you can pledge $180 towards a kit, or $250 if you want a kit that includes muscle control. [ EduExo ] The Acorn team has deployed a Sawyer collaborative robot operating a band saw, where the robot transfers, aligns and cuts pieces of wood to be used as mounts for rubber stamps. Sawyer cuts, drills and inserts the wooden handles for the stamp mounts, effectively automating a complicated, multi-step process. [ Rethink Robotics ] The Office of Naval Research (ONR) TechSolutions-sponsored Mine Warfare Rapid Assessment Capability (mRAC) is a man-portable threat detection and localization system that utilizes an ultra-sensitive magnetometer sensor package installed onboard a small quadrotor platform. [ ONR ] Elad Inbar CEO & Founder of RobotLAB Inc talking with the Learning Counsel about STEM, robotics and the ways in which schools can use technology to reimagine classroom learning.

According to a report in ReCode on Friday, the US Labour Department has sued Google for salary records, arguing it is legally entitled to on grounds that Google is a government contractor. Google has been accused of "systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce." The search engine giant argued in a US court that it would take 500 hours and $100,000 to fulfil the Labour Department's request. According to Google, the requests from the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP), a section of the Labour Department, were "overbroad in scope or reveal confidential data." "We've worked hard to comply with the OFCCP's current audit and have provided hundreds of thousands of records over the last year, including those related to compensation," the report quoted a Google spokesperson as saying. "However, the handful of OFCCP requests that are the subject of the complaint are overbroad in scope, or reveal confidential data, and we've made this clear to the OFCCP, to no avail." The spokesperson added that these requests include thousands of employees' private contract information which they safeguard rigorously. Refuting the claims of the Labour Department, Google claimed that its own analysis of its data showed no gender pay gap, and that its pay model prevented such discrimination. However, not all former employees agreed on this. --IANS qd/ruwa/bg SEARCH More from Sify: talking point on sify news Latest Features Modi-fying bilateral relations: PM's four-nation Europe tour 'Mor' about law!

Google has finally introduced the Google Opinion Rewards app for the Indian market. The app is created by Google Surveys team and allows users to answer quick surveys. The app is now available in India, Singapore and Turkey. The app is available for download from Google Play Store.    The app asks for few surveys, and in turn, users get Google Play credit. The credit can then be used to buy applications or games from Google Play Store. The app is ideal for those who want to buy their favourite games but don’t want to spend real money.      The working of the application is pretty simple. Once you download the app, you need to answer some basic questions about your name, age group, gender and so on. Google will send you surveys around once a week, although it may be more or less frequent. The moment a new survey arrives, you will get a notification on your phone and can receive up to $1.00 ( approx. Rs 64) in Play credit for completing it.   Google is working hard to make the Google Play Store much safer as well. The company, during its annual developer conference, announced a new programme known as Google Play Protect, which safeguard users from malicious and dangerous apps. Play Protect will be built into every device with Google Play and automatically takes action to keep users’ data and device safe. Google says that it scans more than 50 billion apps every day, and the new feature will detect and remove apps that might be harmful.

AFL: Dreamtime at the ‘G was a highlight in its 21st instalment, with over 85,000 packing the MCG for Sir Doug Nicholls’ Indigenous round. The Tigers came out on top in what was a pulsating encounter between these two powerhouse teams. Earlier in the day, the Dees easily accounted for a disappointing Suns after the Suns started brightly in Alice Springs, while the Dogs got back on track with a comfortable win over the Saints. The night ended with a total boilover in Adelaide, with the Crows thumping the Dockers by 100 points. Super Netball: The biggest game of the day lived up to expectation, with the Lightning and Giants playing out a thriller which the Lightning won by the smallest of possible margins. It was a crucial win, which puts the Lightning in the major semi-final against the Vixens, who breezed past the West Coast Fever in the last game of the night, 68-42. Earlier, the Firebirds ended their season on a high with a win over the Swifts. Neither team, however, will play finals this year. Super Rugby: The Rebels were again disappointing, with their loss to the Crusaders compounded by their Wallaby backrower Sean McMahon appearing to break his arm. It’s now 20 matches - including this entire Super Rugby campaign - since an Australian team has beaten a team from New Zealand, heaping more misery on Australian Rugby Union. The Waratahs also lost to the Highlanders, leaving the ‘Tahs second in the Australian conference behind the Brumbies. NRL: The Sharks overran the Bulldogs in the dying minutes, while the Warriors beat a depleted Broncos earlier in the day. Shaun Johnson starred for his side, with two first-half assists and one try to go along with his four conversions. Play of the day: I liked Shai Bolton’s game-saving tackle in the dying minutes of the Dreamtime clash against the Dons. Pressure acts are chronically underrated and this one turned the match. AFL (@AFL) Here's why Tiger fans are enamored with Shai Bolton. #AFLTigersDons pic.twitter.com/wI5bpmm5lV May 27, 2017 Today’s big winners/losers: Hard to go past the Dockers as the big losers of the day. Embarrassing for Ross Lyon who usually prides himself on fielding competitive teams, win or lose. This is clearly tongue in cheek, but David Myers gets a mention for tackling his own team-mate: Andrew McCormack (@_AMcCormack) So...David Myers just tackled his own team mate #AFLTigersDons pic.twitter.com/Gt4HbNjw1s May 27, 2017 The biggest winners were likely the Lightning, with so much on the line in their clash with the Giants. Comeback of the day: Surely the late win by the Sharks over the Bulldogs. As he did for most of the game, Paul Gallen inspired with a 25-metre run in the lead-up to Chad Townsend’s 78th-minute field goal that broke the 8-8 deadlock. rugbyleaguehub.com (@leaguehubcom) #NRLcrocby The run from PaulGallen13. The extra point from chadtownsend10!#NRLSharksBulldogs#NRL pic.twitter.com/jbCbF0jBXX from NRL May 27, 2017 If today were a song: This is not in the usual spirit of this category, but today I kept thinking of Treaty, by Youth Yindi. Hard to believe the song was written in 1991, after Bob Hawke had - in 1988 - promised a treaty by 1990. This week, 27 years later, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander leaders again called for a treaty, as well as the constitutional enshrinement of Indigenous voices in parliament. The call for treaty was made in explicit comparison to the more ‘mainstream’ desire for constitutional recognition that has been featured in the AFL’s Indigenous Round (with players’ jumpers carrying the ‘Recognise’ symbol). As Calla Wahlquist writes, “the statement said that the high rates of incarceration, youth detention and child removal showed the need for a significant practical change, not a symbolic reform”. Thanks very much to everyone who joined me here on the liveblog tonight, in comments below and on Twitter- I really enjoyed your input. Looking forward to seeing you back here next time, and do join Paul Connolly at midday tomorrow for Sunday’s Australia sportwatch.

Ross Lyon has never coached a side that has lost by 100 points or more - until now. The Crouch brothers set the win up for the Crows, as did Rory Sloane. Eddie Betts was at his scintillating best, kicking three goals while Andy Otten bagged four. Ross Lyon looked to have some stern words with his players after the siren. As in the Dreamtime game, most players swapped guernseys with their opponents after the siren. Eddie Betts kicked three goals as the Crows condemned the Dockers to a three-figure loss.

Heaping more misery on the hapless Rebels, their Wallaby backrower Sean McMahon appeared to have broken his arm to end his hopes of playing in Australia’s Test series next month. McMahon was playing only his third game of the season after returning from injury but went down after making a tackle in the 73rd minute and was escorted from the field by medical staff. The loss meant it’s now 20 matches - including this entire Super Rugby campaign - since an Australian team has beaten a team from New Zealand.

They threatened to lose another tight one after failing to capitalise on the many opportunities, they created, but finally held on as the rain trickled down on the Dreamtime clash. That’s their sixth win after they started with five-straight. The Bombers will be proud of their efforts, but will surely be disappointed after such a convincing win against the Eagles last week. Nice scenes after the siren with some of the players swapping jumpers, including captains Cotchin and Heppell. Cotchin put the red and black for a moment before a club official appeared to tell him to take it off. He replaced it with a Tigers jacket. Jack Riewoldt and the Tigers will be relieved to come away with the win after three consecutive losses under a goal.

Gallen twice came up with critical plays to set up Saturday night’s victory, including a 25-metre run in the lead-up to Chad Townsend’s 78th-minute field goal that broke an 8-8 deadlock. The former NSW State of Origin skipper also turned the game when, with his team down by six points with 13 minutes to play, he picked up a grubber in-goal and just managed to force his way back into the field of play. With four stars away on Origin duty, Gallen - playing in his first club game during Origin since 2010 - finished with a team-high 181 metres and three tackle breaks. The win extends Cronulla’s winning streak to three and consolidates their top-four spot, while the defeat for the Bulldogs is compounded by a shoulder injury to skipper James Graham. Here’s the field goal that sealed the win for Cronulla. Unbelievable chase by Sharks captain Paul Gallen who dragged his team over the line. rugbyleaguehub.com (@leaguehubcom) #NRLcrocby The run from PaulGallen13.

The sides could barely be split all night, and scores were tied at three-quarter-time. A 15-14 final term ensured the Lightning crossed the line by the barest of margins. The win was crucial, as it means the Lightning will finish second and go into the major semi-final against the Vixens. Whoever wins the Major proceeds straight to the grand final, while the loser gets the all-important second-chance. Meanwhile the Giants will now face the Magpies in the minor semi-final. It’s a blow for the Giants, who have lost their last two games. Nonetheless, they took it up to the Lightning, with the game going down to the wire.

The 29-year-old four-time world champion broke his own lap record late in the session, clocking 1:12.395 to eclipse the time he set on Thursday by three-tenths of a second. In all, four drivers produced laps under the one minute 13 second mark but they did not include Daniel Ricciardo, whose best lap, a 1:13.392, was only good enough for sixth and almost one second off the pace of Vettel. Lewis Hamilton again struggled with his Mercedes and was only fifth fastest at the end of the session. Qualifying begins at 2:00pm on Saturday (10pm AEST).

The Tahs’ hopes of topping the Australian conference dropped on Saturday when they surrendered a 14-13 halftime lead and conceded 17-straight points after the break. The Highlanders scored six tries to four. They capitalised on a one-man advantage early in the second half, when they scored two tries while Waratahs lock Dean Mumm was in the sin-bin. Mumm, who earlier this week announced he would retire at the end of this year, was given a yellow card for a dangerous tackle, but looked a little unlucky. A converted try to replacement halfback Jake Gordon cut the deficit to nine points and lifted the Tahs in their push for a bonus point. Those were quickly extinguished with Daniel Lienert-Brown and Lima Sopoaga touching down for the home team, before Gordon scampered away after taking a quick tap to notch his second five-pointer. The loss leaves the Tahs second in the Australian conference behind the Brumbies, who can stretch that lead by beating the Jaguares on Sunday morning in Buenos Aires.

For the Broncos, a pair of tries to James Roberts within ten minutes put a scare through the Warriors, but James Gavet crossed the line five minutes later to assure the Warriors of the win. The loss sees the Broncos drop from second to third, while the Warriors sit two points outside the eight, with five wins from 12 outings. Shaun Johnson was clearly best on ground against the Broncos.

In the meantime, here’s some reading material in advance of the America’s Cup. The oldest international sporting trophy (dating back to 1851), the America’s Cup is happening in Bermuda this year, and was perhaps one of the most fascinating sources of sporting news this week after claims of espionage ‘like James Bond or the CIA’ emerged. If you know little about the sport (or even if you do), it’s worth reading this feature on how cutting-edge engineering and technology is propelling the sport further into the future. The reigning champions are Oracle Team USA who have Australian Jimmy Spithill at the helm. Another Australian, Nathan Outteridge is steering the hopes of Swedish entry Artemis Racing. The winner of the Louis Vuitton (yes, you read that correctly) Cup Qualifiers will meet Defending Champions Oracle USA. Not sure if it’s just me, but the idea of being out in the water in Bermuda makes me think something extraordinary might happen. For fellow nerds out there, you might want to check out this Guardian article from last year about the ‘mystery’ of the Bermuda Triangle.

Google announced at I/O 2017 that you can make physical photo books from the pictures you have on its Photos app. Initially users could only do it on the desktop browser. Now, Google updated the Photos app on iOS and Android to make it easier for you to make the books. The softcover 7-inch album will cost US$10 for 20 pages, while the hardcover 9-inch version will cost $20 for 20 pages. The downside is this feature is currently only available in the US and Google hasn’t made any announcements if it’ll bring it outside of the country. We’re hoping it makes its way here.

The tech billionaire's blimp, according to The Guardian, is currently under construction at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's) Moffett Field in Santa Clara County, California. The space agency leased a hangar to Alphabet subsidiary Planetary Ventures in 2014 for $1.6bn over the course of 60 years. The helium-fed balloon behemoth will reportedly be almost 200 metres long and is expected to cost $100m to $150m. It is said to have been conceived for use with hydrogen, but evidently someone recalled the fiery fate of the Hindenburg. Moffett Field, just down the road from Google's Mountain View, California, headquarters, previously served a now-defunct commercial zeppelin business, Airship Ventures, which operated sightseeing flights from the facility between 2008 and 2012. Lack of sponsorships and a tenfold increase in the price of helium contributed to the firm's demise, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. The failed company's 75-metre airship, Eureka, has since been disassembled and shipped back to its maker, Zeppelin Luftschifftechnik GmbH, in Germany. Igor Pasternak, CEO of airship company Aeros, expressed optimism about the commercial potential of airships in a phone interview with The Register. Past airship efforts, he suggested, focused too much on niche markets. He described airships as a way to make cargo distribution direct, rather than flowing through an inefficient chain of ports and distribution points. He likened the decentralization airships can bring to the way the internet reshaped information distribution. But it may be a while before airships fill the skies. It will take more than five years, he said. "It took a long time to get from America Online to Gmail," he pointed out. Tech billionaires have shown an affinity for airy ventures. Larry Page, Alphabet's CEO and Google's other founder, owns two flying car companies, Kitty Hawk and Zee.Aero. The two startups are competing to design personal aircraft more appealing than ultralights and more affordable than private planes. Amazon's Jeff Bezos and Tesla's Elon Musk have focused their attention on rocketry, though Musk (who also has an affinity for tunneling) has expressed interest in electric planes. The general public too can look forward to personal air transport, which will probably look more like Uber's Elevate project than Brin's floating folly. But don't expect much for a decade or more, according to a paper published earlier this month by researchers at Duke University and NASA. There may be some outliers – like AeroMobil, which has begun taking pre-orders to deliver a commercially available flying car in 2017. But with a price tag of at least $1.2m, the AeroMobil flying car isn't reaching beyond the traditional private jet market. According to the paper's co-authors – Victoria Chibuogu Nneji, Alexander Stimpson, and Mary (Missy) Cummings from Duke, and Kenneth H Goodrich, from NASA Langley Research Center – the technology necessary for on-demand passenger air travel and the requisite regulatory framework won't be ready for a decade or more. As the paper recounts, prior efforts to democratize air travel have struggled with issues of cost and safety. Faced with low public interest and accidents, New York Airways, which offered helicopter transit in New York City from 1949 to 1979, couldn't make enough money to sustain operations. Then there's the Small Aircraft Transportation System (SATS), a $69m initiative between 2001 and 2005, conceived as a joint partnership between NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration to create a market for low-cost regional aviation using jets like taxis. Its impact was blunted by a decline in the number of private pilots, the limited number and locations of airports that handle general aviation, the challenge of air traffic management, and the high cost of aircraft, the paper explains.

One of the features that Google showed off during the event was called Notification Dots, which are small dots that appear on apps when you have a notification. You won’t be able to try notification dots until Android O rolls out later this year, but you can add an unofficial version of the feature to your phone right now. Don't Miss: New report reaffirms the iPhone 8’s most exciting new feature This week, the first beta for Nova Launcher 5.2 arrived on Google Play. Along with some minor fixes and performances improvements, the latest update adds customizable notification dots to the launcher. You can decide where on the app icon they will appear and how large they will be. And just like the real dots, Nova Launcher’s notification dots will match the color scheme of the app icon they appear on. It’s not an exact replica of the notification dots that will appear on Android O, but if you want to take a trial run of the new feature, this might be the best way to do so, other than downloading the Android O beta. Unfortunately, the Android beta is only available on certain phones, while Nova is universal. If you want to try out the latest version of the Nova Launcher, just opt in on Google Play and wait for the update to arrive on your phone or manually download the 5.2 beta from APKMirror.

Society Economy Sport Arts & Showbiz Overview    News    Articles    Interviews  Calendar Invalid query Google's “Personal” tab filters out everything but your own content May 27, 2017 - 11:11 AMT PanARMENIAN.Net - Google has long surfaced personalized results from Gmail, Photos, and other services in Search when it is relevant to a query. There is now a new “Personal” tab (via Search Engine Roundtable) on the web and mobile to quickly see these results from your various Google apps, 9to5Google reports. “Personal” is the newest filter in Google Search that helps users fine-tune results by content type, like Images, News, Shopping, etc. Depending on the query, Google usually reorders the tabs to list the most relevant filters first. However, for the moment, it appears that the Personal tab is always the last item in the “More” menu. This is the case through multiple search terms that readily bring up Gmail and Calendar cards in the main “All” tab. The most common result that appears under Personal are messages from Gmail, with around 10 messages appearing in a card. Tapping one will immediately open the full message in a tab, with the option to load in Gmail. Results from Calendar and Photos work similarly, with the latter immediately opening up the image, with a “View all Google Photos results” link at the bottom of the card offering to perform a full search in Photos. Similar to the rest of Google Search, ads do appear in the Personal tab, but at the very bottom underneath cards and results on the web. The Personal tab appears to be widely rolled out, with users first seeing the filter yesterday. Available on the web and mobile, it does not appear in the Google app for Android.

[Update: False alert] Google says gifting in the Play Store is "Infeasible," marks it as "Won't Fix" in the Issue Tracker Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/05/26 4:14am PDTMay 26, 2017 15 Plus 1 on G+ 67 Share on Facebook 45 Share on Twitter Total Shares127 Google News Update 1: 2017/05/26 5:03am PDT False alert. Issue was closed in 2013 because it was submitted to the wrong tracker. You know how almost every app or software store lets you buy apps and gift them to someone else? Well, you better put your dreams of ever doing that on Android to rest. Or burying them under 10 feet of disappointment. Someone at Google recently took a look at the Issue Tracker, saw the issue labeled "Implement Gifts within Android Market," which has been added back in 2010 when the Play Store was still the Android Market and which has gathered over 1100 stars and hundreds of comments from users requesting app gifting, and decided to be the bearer of bad news because you know what, this is "infeasible" and Google "won't fix" it. But the writing has been on the wall for a few days; we could have seen it coming if we had been playing closer attention. Credit gifting disappeared from the US Play Store on May 16, and then the support page for Google Play gift cards and promo codes was updated on May 17 to replace the "Google Play credit gifts" section with "Google Play book gifts." That change clearly shows that credit gifting was completely gone, not a glitch, and that from now on, you can only gift music and books, but definitely not credit. Above: Pre-May 17. Below: Current support page. Put 1 and 1 together and you understand that the future of gifting or buying someone credit on Google Play is grim. You better kill your dreams of purchasing apps/games for your friends or employees, gifting a niece or nephew some Play credit for new games educational apps, or encouraging your parents to use a certain app by buying it for them. I still can't wrap my head around the fact that Google, the behemoth that can make AI understand every word I say and predict the news I want to read and the traffic on my way to work, is saying that app gifting is "Infeasible" when other app stores have clearly managed to make it feasible. I'm sure there's a reason, but I can't think of any that would be unsurmountable for Google but not for others, or any that would apply to apps and games but not to books and music. The latter traditionally carry a lot more licensing and legislative limits than apps/games. As a consolation, you can turn to Google Play gift cards and Family Sharing in the countries where they're available to share or send apps and games to others. Update 1: 2017/05/26 5:03am PDT False alert. Issue was closed in 2013 because it was submitted to the wrong tracker. I apologize for the false alert. It looks like the issue was actually marked as "Infeasible" back in 2013 because it was posted to the wrong issue tracker and couldn't be fixed by the AOSP team but had to be submitted to the Google Product Forums instead. The issue has just picked up a lot of comments recently, which brought it to the attention of our tipster and thus our inbox, and with the recent disappearance of the Play credit gifting option, we incorrectly assumed there was a link there. What remains true though is that credit gifting is completely gone and you can only send music and books now. There's no proof that app/game gifting wouldn't make an appearance at some point, so I suppose there's a silver lining somewhere.

Rita El Khoury Yup, as shown in the screenshots, Books and Music gifting is available. But credit buying for others or gifting apps/games is now a dead dream.

Low tech is better... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/276e854598d2a91aa3a795a84e4ecbec4f4f587c8e3da3c55b968c90ad4ec402.jpg Kristian Ivanov https://gfycat.com/RevolvingEdibleCivet h4rr4r Totally wrong article actually. This issue tracker is not for the play store. Thomas Gladdines If I ever had to implement gifting apps I would make it an in app purchase and then simply show a 100% off coupon.

After six months in this job opportunity and managed to get remunerated totally 36 thousand usd... Normally I acquire almost eighty bucks/h and work for 3 to 4 hrs daily.And tremendous factor regarding this task is the fact you can easily handle your time any time you do the job and for just how long as you may wish for and you earn a paycheck weekly........ learn by clicking here how to do it right now jirka maly Google incopetents are more obvious in 6 apps for communication: Allo, Duo, hangouts, messages, voice, G+ Sorry (not really), but Google is led by complete idiots absolutely without a proper tactic thinking Kristian Ivanov I was thinking of posting a really witty comment about this, but the disappointment level was so low that I kind'a don't feel it's worth the effort. Nicholas Conrad Witty comment status: won't fix. Kristian Ivanov It was going to be awesome though, it involved old people, polar bears and a skateboard...oh well, at some point in the future when this is in the news again I'll post it :c Daniel But there's a good reason for it, it's not just that Google is evil: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/36916787#comment108 Status: Won't Fix (Infeasible) This report applies to a mobile Google application or service, and the issue tracker where you reported it specializes in issues within the Open Source source code of the Android platform. We are not able to provide support for Google products in this issue tracker. Please report this issue in the appropriate Google Product Forum at https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!forum/en/ God of chaos It all makes sense now! demarcmj Reading!?! What is this sorcery? Rita El Khoury Ugh... My ctrl+F skills failed me, I admit. Also my little knowledge of how the Issue Tracker works. I could see when or why it was marked as Infeasible so I incorrectly assumed it was now, when the comments flared up again. Nicholas Conrad Don't get down on yourself Rita, we all have days like this at work. Even knowing the premise of the article was mistaken, I'd rather read it again than another JRE video summary article. Rita El Khoury Thanks... I guess?! demarcmj The issue tracker is partly at fault. If you hover over the resolution in that side panel, the mouse turns to the finger like it's a link... but clicking on it doesn't do anything. You would think it would take you to the resolution post for more details. But nope. Rita El Khoury Exactly. I was thinking there's something wrong with Chrome or my connection and restarted it, but clicking wouldn't take me anywhere, so I was like... well, seems like this doesn't show an explanation. demarcmj Doesn't work in Firefox or IE either (haven't tried it in Edge, or whatever they're calling the Windows 10 browser). Do they have an issue tracker for the issue tracker? Mark R. Andrachek, Jr. No. But they might have a product forum. Which nobody at google will ever check, and some "community volunteer" will suggest your reboot your PC. Rita El Khoury Arghhhhh... You're right. Many of us here at AndroidPolice looked at this and we failed to see that it was marked as Infeasible in 2013. I'll edit the post to ad that info. In our defense, many of us at AP looked at this tip and thought the status change was new, especially with the way comments were flaring up on it in the past day and with all the changes to Google Play credit gifting. Daniel No problem! :) Thanks for adding the info FaultException It wasn't marked as infeasble recently, it was marked in 2013, because it's the wrong forum (the tracker is for AOSP/Android itself) See comment #108: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/36916787#comment108 demarcmj Yup... and most of the comments since then are people bickering about not wanting to receive emails every time someone comments on the issue. Real productive thread they have going on over there [eyeroll] Zomby2D I'm guilty of contributing to the email pollution. I had the issue starred but I haven't been getting email notifications for the longest time from this. I don't even remember noticing that it had been closed all that time ago. I just started receiving notifications again last week and figured that the ticket being closed was the reason why people were suddenly complaining. Having the reason for closing it lost in the sea of comments didn't help. Rita El Khoury Right. Fixing the post to reflect that. Dennis Ulijn I can also see the fact that people buy 100 apps with a stolen credit card and sell them on the black market, like G2A or G2play. You talk about a lot of other stores doing this already, but the uplay and steam store have had a lot of problems with this and still have those problems, without a good way to combat it. Besides that, how will you solve the VAT system? Who pays? I can see how a lot of people want it, and of course i don't mind having the possibility, but there are more problems than 'just implement it'. Carson Saldanha I think it's due to security reasons but that sucks... h4rr4r Read the update! couldn't be fixed by the AOSP team but had to be submitted to the Google Product Forums instead. h4rr4r Good retraction, update! Rita El Khoury "because it was posted to the wrong issue tracker and couldn't be fixed by the AOSP team but had to be submitted to the Google Product Forums instead." Isn't that enough of an explanation? h4rr4r I was at first talking about just the update line. But on reading the full explanation I thought it was pretty good. Ideally the update line at the top would say something about why not when. Rita El Khoury That's an automatically truncated blurb that our WordPress theme does at the top. I'll manually change it to clarify that in a bit, I was just in a rush to update the post before we got more comments telling us how wrong we were. h4rr4r YAY! krazyfrog Apple has had App Store gifting for all content since years now and somehow it's "infeasible" for Google. 🙄 Rita El Khoury Refresh your page ;) Peter World Citizen I had seen people got fired for lesser mistakes. ;) Rita El Khoury We'd be firing half the AP team and Artem. Many of us looked at this and didn't notice. Guess the post I/O haziness hasn't dissipated yet. Mark R. Andrachek, Jr. Google's Issue Tracker recently got a re-vamp. They can control, I'm sure, what the closed states are for things in their own tracker. They really need to have a closed/won't fix state that indicates that the issue has been raised in the wrong venue going forward, if they want to keep the issue tracker limited to just AOSP. These kind of things keep coming up in the AOSP issue tracker and _will continue_ to come up in the AOSP tracker if nothing changes. They don't expose issue tracking for anything else. Finding these product forums at all, much less the right one, is an exercise in madness. And then when you do find them, they're typically staffed by unpaid community volunteers. Chances are high that nobody from Google will actually see your issue, much less respond. It's like shouting into the void. Funem They should just make it so you can purchase an item, then chose to install it or create a sort of promo code which you can then just give to someone to use. They could tie it in to the promo code system they have now. Until its claimed you could still retain the option to install it by using the code yourself. prwnd Dear Community, I suggested this and I apologise because I did not find it was changed in 2013.

Suggested Sharing is going live in Google Photos for some users Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/25 5:30pm PDTMay 25, 2017 41 Plus 1 on G+ 118 Share on Facebook 77 Share on Twitter Total Shares236 Applications Google News Google Photos is ground zero for the company's crazy machine learning technology. At Google I/O 2017, a number of new features were announced for Photos, including suggested sharing based on who's in a certain photo. But for that to work, Google needs to figure out who is who, and now the Photos web app is asking users to identify what they look like. Upon visiting photos.google.com, you may be welcomed by the above screen. Google already uses machine learning wizardry to match faces to people, so all you have to do is select which face is yours. Once you do that, you'll be able to search for "me" in the Photos search to find pictures of yourself. According to a recent teardown, this option should appear at some point in the Photos app as well, but it didn't for me. Presumably, this will be far more useful once the other features announced at Google I/O show up. Let us know in the comments if you have received the pop-up.

I got the pop up just the other day. I can search for "me" in addition to others such as my daughter's name. John Doe I did but for some reason it shows a photo of me from over 6 years ago even though I have plenty of recent photos LoL Corbin Davenport Yep, my picture was an awful photo of me from several years ago. John Doe I was able to change it by going to people then clicking on the picture and even when you choose a picture with a lot of people in it figures out which one is you and zooms in...creepy bozzykid It doesn't matter what photo you choose of yourself. The rest are all linked to you anyways. This isn't replacing your profile pic. John Doe No but some photos it has not figured out its me or at least when I click on me it doesn't show all the pictures of me but it is good enough to find pictures of me when I was a child which is crazy because I changed a lot. Stakoman Is this US only? would be great if you guys made a "how to enable face recognition google photos" post Suicide_Note Use a US VPN to start using the face recognition. Once you get things setup, you can stop using the VPN, though face recognition should still work. rndusrnm479461 You can use a VPN (get tunnelbear cause it's free) for Android, then clear cache, open photos and enable grouping of faces in the settings. Then you can disable VPN. I did this about a year ago and I've had it ever since without any problem both on Android and on the web. bozzykid I believe it uses one of the firsts photos you have stored. It has already linked the rest to you anyways. Régis Knechtel Not always, apparently, cause it used a recent photo for me. I think it's random. Brendapdaniels Google is paying 97$ per hour!

LightofHonor Has been there for me for awhile. Useful since I can search multiple names and it shows all the pictures with those people in it. Defenestratus No. Régis Knechtel "his option should appear at some point in the Photos app as well" It asked to chose my face me today in the android app, while I was setting up a new phone. jcopernicus I accidentally closed the prompt...how to I get it back? Corbin Davenport On the web, go to Settings -> Group similar faces, and there should be an option to pick your face. Yatin No, I'm from India Drakenoid Yes, I'm also from India. Naga Sridhar I am from India too, but are you in India? myssi Pop-up recieved, I'm from Pakistan. Tomáš Petrík And I guess we will be left out in the EU, again :/ Indefinite Implosion I'm in NL and got it a few days ago? A day or two after the announcement maybe (crunch time, so days are a blur). I didn't tip because it doesn't do anything right now so hardly seems worthy of a post. roberto.elena Do you already have "group similar faces" activated? If yes, then you will get this update. Tomáš Petrík No, it is disabled for accounts registered in the EU due to some stupid privacy ruling of the EU. roberto.elena I know, but you can activate it using a VPN (or at least that was possible when they launched Google Photos). Once it's activated, you don't need the VPN anymore, and you get all updates related to face recognition features. Nelson Not correct. I'm in Europe and by using Opera VPN plus Google Photos cache clear the feature appeared Amir Instead of copying and pasting your Debbie Downer response on every single comment, go try it with a VPN. Gosh! Tomáš Petrík I don't know who Debbie Downer is and I posted a similar response only due to the fact that I want to react to multiple people and I want them all to get a notification so that they know somebody replied to their post. Suicide_Note Use a US VPN and you can join the party. Tomáš Petrík It's not about VPN this time. Accounts registered in the EU have facial recognition disabled due to some stupid privacy ruling of the EU. Jens Törnblad That's why you activate the feature with a VPN. Suicide_Note Ah, okay. I wasn't aware of that. Definitely sucks. Mr K Nope. I cleaned data from Google Photos and force closed, activated Tunnelbear (it's free for 500MB but you won't use more than 50) in the US and opened Photos. Configured everything (make sure face recognition" is activated in settings) and everything works fine. I just got the notification in Photos for web about this new feature. And you can of course uninstall the VPN when everything is set up. rndusrnm479461 Get tunnelbear for Android. Choose a US vpn. Clear Google Photos cache -> open it -> enable grouping of faces in the settings. You only have to do this once. I did it a year ago and it has worked ever since on all my devices. Tomáš Petrík It's not about VPN this time, though. Accounts registered in the EU have facial recognition disabled due to some stupid privacy ruling of the EU. rndusrnm479461 Really? I registered mine in EU in ~2008 and activated face grouping in early 2016 without problems. henleyb I got it a day or two ago. Was an old photo but searching for 'me' did bring up correct photos for me so that's something. Looking forward to the sharing stuff next. :) Suicide_Note Haven't seen this popup yet, but on a related note, photo books have gone live for me in the Photos app. Taylor Hardy I work from ease of my residence, with the help of easy jobs that merely usually requires from you a Computer system and even on-line connection and I am also more successful than ever before...

I immediately went to my S7 to see did I have it and nothing. Joao Letelier Ummm... I have been able to search for "me" since last year on the photos app on my phone. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/6ec05347bcd3f095b697a97df58508cf28a8d34b7fc289baa308796bc81cf2b3.jpg Deeco Skynet. slowly, but surely...

As you can see, the new tool enables you to create a GIF using any data points – Google suggests you can use Google Trends data, but the actual input is manual, so you can use any data you want. You fill in the relevant fields, select the colors for each point, enter in a title, then press ‘Launch Comparisons’ and you'll get a sample of your new GIF, like this. The GIF option provides you with an interesting way to present relevant data – you have to experiment with it a bit to get it exactly how you’d like (note the full title is cut off in the Twitter listing in my example), but it’s an interesting option, especially for those looking for new ways to highlight such insights. As you may have noticed, content creators love to add in Google Trends data to underpin their points - though it can sometimes lead to come misleading stats. Here’s an example (as highlighted by Danny Page in his excellent Medium post on the subject), when the Brexit vote was completed, and the subsequent confusion was in full swing, Google Trends published this tweet: "What is the EU?" is the second top UK question on the EU since the #EURefResults were officially announced pic.twitter.com/1q4VAX3qcm — GoogleTrends (@GoogleTrends) June 24, 2016 Which lead to this article in The Washington Post. But as Page points out, their definition of ‘frantic’ may not quite be accurate – when you put that increased search volume in context, matched against other trends, you can see that while the volume had increased, it wasn't getting massive attention. As such, it’s important to put the data in context – but when used well, Google Trends can provide some great visualizations and data accompaniments, which is what Google’s looking to help boost with their new data tool. GIFs can also help boost content engagement – on Twitter, for example, Tweets with GIFs generate 6X more engagement than basic text updates. It’s a small addition, sure, but an interesting one – an easy to use data visualization tools which you can use in your content.  Author Information Andrew Hutchinson @adhutchinson Sign up for the Social Media Today newsletter You'll get a daily email with the latest news, lessons, and insights on: Social Media Marketing Digital Strategy and more Yes, I'd like to receive Marketing Dive's daily newsletter as well.

[Update: Now $75 Off] Deal Alert: Pixel 32GB (international version) is $50 off on eBay Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/05/26 2:20pm PDTMay 26, 2017 2 Plus 1 on G+ 53 Share on Facebook 57 Share on Twitter Total Shares112 Deals News Pixel Update 1: 2017/05/26 2:32pm PDT It looks like the price has dropped another $25, making this a $75 savings in total. For a device that hasn't seen much in the way of price drops or It's no secret that Google has had some serious supply issues with its flagship Pixel phone. That goes for pretty much any combination of size, color, or storage. Rumors even began to surface alleging that Google had stopped production of the devices altogether. That wasn't the case, but nonetheless, you will still struggle to actually find the Pixel if you wish to buy it. A 32GB Pixel (international version) on eBay for $50 off the list price could be the answer to that problem. This is the entry level 5" Pixel, with 32GB of storage in the color Very Silver - and it's available for $599. That's $50 less than the $649 Google is still charging for it. Beware though, this is the international version of the device. So if you live in the US you'll have to check the bands to see if it works on your network. This version won't play nice with Verizon or Sprint, so if you're on either of those carriers you can rule this out. If you live outside the US then this is definitely for you. Shipping appears to be free in the US, but here in the UK, it's $18.99. That still works out a bargain for me, especially if you account for the exchange rate. You'll have to do the sums from where you are to see if the deal is as good for you. It's worth mentioning that getting your warranty honored might be tough with this type of purchase, so bear that in mind. It's hard to say how many of these they have, other than a "limited quantity," so you'll have to be quick if you want to get your hands on arguably the best Android phone of 2016. Update 1: 2017/05/26 2:32pm PDT It looks like the price has dropped another $25, making this a $75 savings in total. For a device that hasn't seen much in the way of price drops or sales since launch, $75 off isn't bad. Anyone interested in a Pixel that uses a network compatible with this international model should give it a serious think.

Middlefinger As a back up phone yeah, its not reliable enough to be a daily driver. Its problems seem to be a mixture of hardware bugs, and Googles poor software QC. me me "bargain" JL "buggy" Gladysrcrosby Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job.

It doesnt matter how 'high end' a device is, if it doesn't work properly, its worthless. jonzey231 $50 is worth a guarantee that Google will honor the warranty....trust me...I wish I would've gotten my 6P direct. Andy What do you mean? jonzey231 If you don't buy the phone from Google, they won't help you. They send you to the manufacturer. I was forced to go to Huawei for my 6P and it was a little over 3 weeks before I got it back....and the problem is still there. Spend the extra $50 and buy it through Google so you're guaranteed to get support through their CS channels. You'll be glad you did in 6 months when something inevitably goes wrong. IMHO get the OnePlus 3T. Costs less but has better overall specs aside from the camera which is still pretty good in its own right. My brother has one and my roommate just got his last week and they both have no intention of going back to a major brand ever again. YaKillaCJ Same happened when I got the OnePlus One. It changed the way I (and many others) view a "budget" device from an unknown brand. needa I felt the same way after using an OPO for nearly three years. Got me an XL in mint condition for $450. Google edition even. Still had 3520 mAh in the batt too. Would have bought the black 3T had they been in stock. Took me three days to hunt down this deal. Andy Got my wife the pixel. Runs great. Just had the microphone problem. Google swapped without question. Wife seems to think it takes horrible selfies. Rod Weird, as it's cameras are regarded among the best currently. Random! @andy maybe you should let her know that the camera isn't the problem... It's actually her face. If you do warn her about this, I promise to visit you at the hospital. Andy Thanks for the tip. VAVAMk_2 Huzzah! Master Yates Agreed with you regarding the 3T. Lets see if the excellent updates and support evaporate when the One Plus 5 is released? That's the real test. IcerC Except in this case Google is the Manufacturer, that might change things. VAVAMk_2 Google didn't make the camera. Uses a Sony made sensor but the camera software is Google's and regarded among the best in post processing, particularly HDR. Roy Ahh so nice call me when the 1+2 will get Nougat and your friend will get or never get Android O. ddevito #Fail Andy S8 release response? AdMoc Does not ship to Poland as fck always -_- Random! Look for some service like Shipito. I believe they have an EU warehouse. Shakil Shaikh $60 shipping? kristin ANY Pixel made by google is compatible with any provider. It doesnt matter if its international or not. This writer is an odiot. Scott Scrivens https://www.techwalls.com/google-pixel-pixel-xl-model-number-differences/ Kevin Davis "Odiot", lmao. 😂 Oh, and you're wrong, too. kristin I called google about this. It would be up your phone company provider whether it worked or not. So it may not work with att or tmobile either. kristin This may or may not work on any provider. Its up to the provider. You want a pixel? Go to swappa.com and get one used in mint condition for much cheaper. Ive gotten a few phones from them since ive been on project fi and had no issues. Ill never buy a new phone again. Random! $50 off? How cute... If they get to $300 off ($350 final price) within a month, I might even convince myself it's worth to stare at those bezels everyday. Other than that (impossible) scenario, I'd rather get the 3T, Axon 7, or even the LG G5. Gjorgi Lazarovski The Pixel is probably not dropping in price anytime soon. iKon The most overrated smartphone of 2016. Only the camera is decent. Ugly ass design, overpriced and dull with no features compared to competition Roy You mean the best smartphone of 2016, best camera rare band front, best software, best updates. Great battery, great display. xyz No, he means "The most overrated smartphone of 2016. Only the camera is decent. Ugly ass design, overpriced and dull with no features compared to competition." Roy No, I'm sure he/she means "the best smartphone of 2016, best camera rare band front, best software, best updates. Great battery, great display". iKon No I meant what I said. The pixel is a flop and even Google knows it. No matter how much money they put into advertising there are alot of better choices out there.. only hard core Google fanboys try and big it up Roy Yes yada yada and still every reviewer said is the best smartphone of 2016. So.. even David here. In the on of the day it's a lots about the UI and I just don't like Samsung software. Ordeith LOL. You're such a Google sycophant, Roy. Roy You feeling really smart? I'm Imagine your ass all over your face. nirmitlamed Google is so off track in figuring out what customers wants and competing against the other monstrous companies. I would very much like to hear how many Pixels Google sold in the last year since they told us they sold more than they expected. Lawrence I can put my coffee cup on the Bezel David Nowicki I'm a big Nexus fan, but why would you pay $749 for the Pixel XL vs the OnePlus 3T at about half the price ? And soon the OnePlus 5 at $450 or so with S8+ specs will be a steal compared to the Pixel 4Ui812 Supply and demand. Limit the supply and you increase demand. It's like P.T. Barnum said , "There's a sucker born every minute".

By: Bloomberg | Published:May 27, 2017 1:02 pm Apple is working on a processor devoted specifically to AI-related tasks, according to a person familiar with the matter. Related News Apple WWDC 2017 keynote: What time is livestream, how to watch and everything else to note Apple WWDC 2017: Look for signs when Tim Cook takes the stage Apple WWDC 2017: iOS 11 to Siri speaker, everything to be announced Apple Inc. got an early start in artificial intelligence software with the 2011 introduction of Siri, a tool that lets users operate their smartphones with voice commands. Now the electronics giant is bringing artificial intelligence to chips. Apple is working on a processor devoted specifically to AI-related tasks, according to a person familiar with the matter. The chip, known internally as the Apple Neural Engine, would improve the way the company’s devices handle tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence — such as facial recognition and speech recognition, said the person, who requested anonymity discussing a product that hasn’t been made public. Apple declined to comment. Engineers at Apple are racing to catch their peers at Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. in the booming field of artificial intelligence. While Siri gave Apple an early advantage in voice-recognition, competitors have since been more aggressive in deploying AI across their product lines, including Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Home digital assistants. An AI-enabled processor would help Cupertino, California-based Apple integrate more advanced capabilities into devices, particularly cars that drive themselves and gadgets that run augmented reality, the technology that superimposes graphics and other information onto a person’s view of the world. “Two of the areas that Apple is betting its future on require AI,” said Gene Munster, former Apple analyst and co-founder of venture capital firm Loup Ventures. “At the core of augmented reality and self-driving cars is artificial intelligence.” Improved Performance Apple devices currently handle complex artificial intelligence processes with two different chips: the main processor and the graphics chip. The new chip would let Apple offload those tasks onto a dedicated module designed specifically for demanding artificial intelligence processing, allowing Apple to improve battery performance. Should Apple bring the chip out of testing and development, it would follow other semiconductor makers that have already introduced dedicated AI chips. Qualcomm Inc.’s latest Snapdragon chip for smartphones has a module for handling artificial intelligence tasks, while Google announced its first chip, called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), in 2016. That chip worked in Google’s data centers to power search results and image-recognition. At its I/O conference this year, Google announced a new version that will be available to clients of its cloud business. Nvidia Corp. also sells a similar chip to cloud customers. The Apple AI chip is designed to make significant improvements to Apple’s hardware over time, and the company plans to eventually integrate the chip into many of its devices, including the iPhone and iPad, according to the person with knowledge of the matter. Apple has tested prototypes of future iPhones with the chip, the person said, adding that it’s unclear if the component will be ready this year. Apple’s operating systems and software features would integrate with devices that include the chip. For example, Apple has considered offloading facial recognition in the photos application, some parts of speech recognition, and the iPhone’s predictive keyboard to the chip, the person said. Apple also plans to offer developer access to the chip so third-party apps can also offload artificial intelligence-related tasks, the person said. Developer Conference Apple may choose to discuss some of its latest advancements in AI at its annual developer’s conference in June. At the same conference, Apple plans to introduce iOS 11, its new operating system for iPhones and iPads, with an updated user-interface, people with knowledge of the matter said last month. The company is also said to discuss updated laptops with faster chips from Intel Corp. An AI chip would join a growing list of processors that Apple has created in-house. The company began designing its own main processors for the iPhone and iPad in 2010 with the A4 chip. It has since released dedicated processors to power the Apple Watch, the motion sensors across its products, the wireless components inside of its AirPods, and the fingerprint scanner in the MacBook Pro. The company has also tested a chip to run the low-power mode on Mac laptops. In 2015, Bloomberg reported that Apple’s culture of secrecy stymied the iPhone maker’s ability to attract top AI research talent. Since then, Apple has acquired multiple companies with deep ties to artificial intelligence, has begun publishing papers related to AI research, has joined a key research group and has made hires from the field. In October 2016, Apple hired Russ Salakhutdinov from Carnegie Mellon University as its director of AI research.

Even today the first generation TPUs beat anything commercially available. But Google now has generation 2 which is just miles ahead of anything else. A TPU pod is able to generate 11.5 peta flops of fp16. No that is NOT a typo. But the key is Google is doing it on a small fraction of the power of any compe or. So Google inference per joule is a tiny fraction of someone like Nvidia. Smart move on Apple to try to copy Google and create something similar. Google shared the details of their generation 1 in a paper that Apple could then just use to build theirs.

Set a specific time to get the things done in a stipulated time frame. - Social media platforms occupy a major part in our everyday lives and at the same time create distractions with our work. Just turn off your phone notifications or you can check these in your break time. - Keep your goals in sight all the time especially when you're working. When you see your goals many times throughout the day, your motivation level will be up to get things done effectively. - Apply two-minute rule to your life. If any task takes less than two minute, then do it now.

By: Bloomberg | Published: May 27, 2017 12:37 PM Theresa May, who is leaving the summit a day early to return to London, led the push for the changes in the wake of the bombing.(Reuters) Group of Seven leaders meeting in Sicily on Friday called on Google Inc., Facebook Inc. and other internet companies to do “substantially” more to take extremist material offline. The gathering comes just four days after a suicide bomber killed 22 people in Manchester, an attack “that demonstrates that we must now redouble our efforts,” the leaders said in a statement after the first day of talks. They pledged to tackle the risk posed by fighters as they disperse from the battlefields of Syria, Libya and elsewhere. The show of unity comes as the U.K. is still on the highest alert for further terrorist attacks, with thousands of troops taking to the streets to help keep the public safe. U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May, who is leaving the summit a day early to return to London, led the push for the changes in the wake of the bombing. You may also like to watch: “Against the backdrop of Monday’s cowardly attack in Manchester, we have discussed what more we can do together to address the threat from terror,” May said. “Make no mistake, the fight is moving from the battlefield to the internet.” May had pushed for a statement that would urge companies to develop tools to automatically identify material based on what it contains and who has posted it — and help the authorities identify and catch extremists. “While being one of the most important technological achievements in the last decades, the Internet has also proven to be a powerful tool for terrorist purposes,” the G-7 leaders said in a statement. The called on internet service providers and social media companies “to substantially increase their efforts to address terrorist content.” The G-7 leaders also pledged to help create an industry-led forum to work together on the issues. Speaking to reporters, May said that G-7 ministers would soon meet on the issue. “That is a big step forward,” May told reporters. “We have put our full weight behind the creation of this.” No Comments.

With the arrival of a new lead model, the RRP of the older edition, the Galaxy S7 series in this case, drops noticeably. But such phones are packed with high-end, future-proof technology which doesn't simply become redundant in the space of a year; far from it, in fact, the Galaxy S7 is still a potent device in the marketplace. The Samsung Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 EDGE were two of the best phones of 2016 - and it isn't just us holding this opinion. Nope, at MWC 2017, the GSM Association (GSMA), the global mobile operator trade body which runs the show, officially awarded the Samsung Galaxy S7 EDGE with the title of "Best Smartphone of 2016". The award was handed to Samsung under the category of "Best Mobile Handsets and Devices," at the associations annual Global Mobile Awards, which takes place at the expo every year. In a statement regarding the award, Samsung said: "As the world leader in mobile innovation, Samsung continues to relentlessly pursue the best in hardware, software and services, redefining what is possible for consumers across the globe. The Galaxy S7 edge was awarded for its refined design, advanced camera and outstanding performance." Junho Park, Samsung's vice president of global product strategy for mobile, said "We are honored to be recognized for our craftsmanship in design and innovation with the Galaxy S7 edge." "This award is a testament to our constant pursuit of excellence as we continue to exceed consumers’ expectations through revolutionary mobile technology." In the mobile space 2016 was an interesting year, a lot of cool stuff happened, and some stuff not so cool - like the Galaxy Note 7 exploding all over the place. However, in terms of the "best" phones of the year, there weren't a great many options. Of course from the Apple camp there was the iPhone 7 series; not bad, but fairly incremental, and the major overhaul is coming in 2017 by all accounts. Outside of the iOS stable, Windows Phone appears to be dead, leaving Android to clean house. Even here, however, for genuinely excellent smartphones in 2016 it pretty much narrows down to the Samsung Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 EDGE, the LG G5, the OnePlus 3T, and the Google Pixel and Pixel XL. And it's worth pointing out that Samsung's Galaxy S7 duo and the LG G5 both launched earliest in the year - February - and were STILL kicking pretty much everything else's ass until offerings from Google and OnePlus arrived in the latter quarter of 2016. In the run-up to the big reveal, both  Galaxy S7 devices proved possibly Samsung's worst-kept secret to date, not that this is meant as a slight against Samsung - pretty much every manufacturer is unable to keep things wrapped up tight these days and in-development products always leaks onto the web in abundance. Consequently, once again much of the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge design, and many of the features, are not a surprise to anyone who had been keeping an eye on things in the six months or so ahead of the launch. As per the rumours, the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge are not tremendously different design-wise from the Galaxy S6 series, and this is no bad thing because those devices were absolutely gorgeous, made from high-end materials, and offered a premium feel in the hand - in my opinion some of the best handsets Samsung has ever made. All good stuff. But there are still some noteworthy differences and new features to make the Galaxy S7 edge stand out from its forebears. Samsung Galaxy S7 EDGE Review: Design & Display No prizes here for guessing that the Galaxy S7 edge features Samsung's unique edge display design - that's where the display panel curves around the two longer sides of the phone using flexible OLED screen technology and contoured glass. It's a signature look, and a very attractive one at that, adding a bit of unusual visual interest to make the phone more than your typical smartphone slab. However, get the Galaxy S7 edge alongside the Galaxy S7 and you'll notice another major difference - the phone's size. Last year's Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge were more-or-less the same in terms of the physical device size and display size, with a few extra millimetres here and there to accommodate the display curvature.  That's all changed for 2016, with the Galaxy S7 edge being a significantly bigger model than the regular Galaxy S7 and packing a 5.5in display compared to the non-edge model's 5.1in screen. The rumours of some additional curves to the Galaxy S7 edge back panel were true, although it's a very small, subtle change that could easily be missed - on the whole it's the spitting image of its predecessor, including the welcome use of glass and metal in the same places and a selection of similar metallic colour options. Just as with the Galaxy S6 series, the build quality here is as superb as the visual design and it's a very robust feeling phone to get to grips with. Also worth noting is that the camera bump has been reduced quite significantly, although it's still not flush. If you've been following the Galaxy S7 series rumours for a while you'll know that water and dust proofing was rumoured, but, as is often the case, there were some conflicting rumours saying it wasn't so. Fortunately, the naysayers were wrong, and the waterproofing that's been missing since the Galaxy S5 has made a welcome return here. It's an IP68 certification, officially good for up to 1.5m of water for up to 30 minutes, although this is really just a legal disclaimer more than anything. At the end of the day, we want waterproofing for rain, spills, and for those rare occasions where you drop your phone in a sink/toilet/river - and in all these scenarios it should be fine. It's also worth mentioning the waterproofing has been achieved through coating of the components of the phone with protective layers, so there are no port covers or rubber grommets to contend with. The display itself is Samsung's usual high end Super AMOLED with a QHD resolution (2560 x 1440 pixels), that's the same resolution as the smaller Galaxy S6 edge display, though naturally the larger screen size means a slightly lower pixel density than both last year's model and the non-edge Galaxy S7; the Galaxy S7 edge's pixel density is 543ppi. Not that any of this is a problem of course, these are all high enough pixel densities to produce incredibly sharp picture quality, while the Super AMOLED provides the rich colour and contrast we've come to expect from Samsung flagships, as well as very good brightness, sunlight performance, and viewing angles. A new feature for the Galaxy S7 edge is the always on display (or AOD, for short)...well, it's new for Samsung's flagship series, anyway - we have seen this elsewhere before though. Of course this doesn't mean the display is literally always on, at least not completely, but it does mean that you can pick some information to be displayed even when the phone is in its sleeping state in a low-power mode. This utilises OLED tech's unique advantage - selectively powering only certain pixels. A shortlist of available display options for AOD includes calendar, clock, and notifications, although we suspect it probably has wider applications than that. As if the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge display specs weren't impressive enough just on paper, prominent display testing and analysis source DisplayMate has published its in-depth examination of the screen technology in use on both handsets. The findings are pretty glowing, to say the very least, with DisplayMate delcaring Samsung's phones as having the brightest displays it has ever tested, together with the most accurate colour it has ever tested too! "While the Galaxy S7 screen size and resolution remain the same as the Galaxy S6, its has been significantly improved for most display performance metrics. The most noticeable one is a Maximum Brightness that is 24% higher than the Galaxy S6, which is quite a significant improvement in high ambient light. The Contrast and Contrast Rating for High Ambient Light have also significantly improved," states the report. "The display on the Galaxy S7 matches and even exceeds the performance of Galaxy Note 5 that we tested in 2015 and rated it as the Best Performing Smartphone Display that we had ever tested. This is a particularly significant enhancement because the 5.1 inch Galaxy S7 display is considerably smaller so the display components had to be scaled down by 20 percent in area from the larger 5.7 inch Galaxy Note 5, and then still deliver the same Maximum Brightness from the smaller pixels." Samsung Galaxy S7 EDGE Review: Hardware & Battery Another revived feature is the inclusion of a microSD card slot, which is great for multimedia collections. Samsung hasn't reintroduced a removable battery pack, however, as this is a unibody phone, but the cell has been bumped up from last year's 2600mAh to an impressive 3600mAh, just as rumours suggested. Obviously this will need testing, but a battery pack that size should offer very good performance, plus we've found the last few Samsung flagships have offered excellent battery life generally and even better with the excellent Super Power Saving mode. The Galaxy S7 EDGE battery life is noticably better than its predecessor and easily one of the best battery performers from the current crop of flagships. For a start, it's a bigger cell than the Galaxy S6 EDGE at 3,600mAh instead of the old 2,600mAh. But it also seems plenty of optimisations have been made, with the phone clocking up a 17 hours and 48 minute result in our continuous video playback test. To put that in perspective, the Galaxy S6 EDGE result was 13 hours, so you get nearly five hours more life out of the Galaxy S7 EDGE - that's most of a working day! Of course you've also got plenty of connectivity capabilities built-in, all that you might expect, including NFC, 4G LTE, and Wi-Fi. It has a microUSB port but it's not the new Type-C version. Both storage options are pretty ample with the base model being 32GB going up to a full 64GB if you're splashing out. Certainly we can see the sense in the modern app and content market of ditching a 16GB lower-tier, but although the presence of 256GB of microSD support is a welcome one it's only really any good for multimedia as Samsung hasn't implemented Android Marshmallow's native Adoptive Storage feature - in other words it can't use cards for storing apps. While the flexibility is nice, we can't help but wonder why Samsung wouldn't either open up support for Adoptive Storage OR introduce a 128GB top-tier storage model above the 64GB one. Without either option, some power users may be in for a tricky time, but most users shouldn't have too much of a problem. Samsung Galaxy S7 EDGE Review: Processor Samsung has pulled its usual trick of shipping different processor models in different regions - the Samsung Exynos and the Qualcomm Snapdragon. Officially the firm has said that CPU performance will be 30% faster than the Galaxy S6 series while the GPU has a 64% uplift. Samsung does have an interesting and rather PC-like solution to performance-related heat this time as well - the handset contains a heat pipe filled with water, and when the SoC heats up the water turns to vapour before being cooled via a heatsink. Smart. Interestingly, Youtube channel JerryRigEverything has now released a video showing the Galaxy S7 edge being dismantled on camera - in case you were wondering what its insides looked like. As well as being quite cool generally, the video showcases the heat-pipe setup from around the 4:30 mark. Video of Galaxy S7 Edge Screen Replacement - Charging Port Repair - battery fix Having spent a bit of time with a few other high-end 2016 Android phones using similar processor setups, I can say that the Exynos 8890-based Galaxy S7 EDGE is definitely in a similar ballpark. In general operation things are silky smooth for navigating Android and hopping between apps, and even when playing intensive 3D games this phone definitely packs a punch. I can't say I noticed any latency issues or lag whatsoever, even when trying to deliberately push the device out of its comfort zone, although it must be said the back panel did heat up a fair bit. Benchmarks tests do show that the Snapdragon 820 edition does ever-so-slightly outperform the Exynos hardware, in particular when it comes to graphics, but the main takeaway here is the difference between the two in most scenarios is a handful of frames-per-second; importantly not enough to be noticeable in actual real-world use. A quick glance at most benchmarking test results and databases online shows that the Galaxy S7 EDGE Exynos model is still one of the top performing smartphones on the market, and I for one think this is reflected in actual operation. NOTHING seems to shake this handset, it just waltzes through whatever you throw at it effortlessly. Latest Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge deals: Samsung Galaxy S7 EDGE Review: Camera Typical of Samsung's flagship series both the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge feature the same camera setup and, again, the rumours were spot on here with a 12MP sensor. That's a lower megapixel rating than previous models, but this is entirely deliberate as Samsung, like many other Android OEMs, has focused on improving other areas of the camera hardware. The sensor uses a higher-rated 1.4um pixels, up from the Galaxy S6, to help with noise reduction, alongside a very wide f/1.7 aperture (last year's was f/1.9 - lower ratings are wider and therefore preferable in allowing in more light), and super-fast dual-pixel phase detection.  Sensor: 12MP, 1/2.6" Aperture: f/1.7 Pixel Size: 1.4 µm Focal Length: 26mm Flash: Dual-LED Features: Optical Image Stabilisation (OIS), dual-pixel phase detection autofocus, simultaneous video and still capture, touch focus, HDR (auto), face and smile detection, panoramic capture, motion panorama, wide angle selfie, "hyperlapse", motion photo Video: 4K, 1080p, 720p Secondary Specs (Sensor, Aperture, Focal Length): 5MP, f/1.7, 22mm I've consistently been impressed by Samsung's camera setups for years now and with the Galaxy S7 this doesn't show any signs of changing. Yes, the sensor has a lower 12MP rating than the Galaxy S6's 16MP setup, but then again so does every major flagship on the market right now because, across the board, OEMs have finally twigged that more MP doesn't mean better image quality all on its own. Thus, plenty of other aspects of the imaging setup have been tweaked instead, including a very large aperture, pixel, and sensor size, resulting in much sharper details and less noise. The Galaxy S6's imaging capabilities were already impressive, but this is even more so.  The dynamic range is very capable as you can see between the shaded roof area and the brightly illuminated street. I also remain very fond of Samsung's approach to photography which is similar to its displays, that is; it is not afraid of punchy colour saturation and contrast. The result of this is really vibrant images, whether that's capturing a really bright blue sky on a sunny day, lush green vegetation, colourful flowers, or the crisp contrast on that statue head pictured below.  As you can see from this coffee bean shot, close-up work still gets plenty of detail and crispness. Capture speed is lightning quick thanks to the dual-pixel phase detection autofocus and this together with the detail-intensive sensor/aperture AND OIS means there's very little chance of picking up any blurriness. The camera interface is nice and simple to use too. Just as with the last few generations of Samsung flagships, here again I am a big fan of the ease-of-use with Samsung's camera hardware and software. Too often there are mobile camera configurations which, while actually sometimes a bit more capable in terms of image fidelity, are frustratingly complex to actually get the best results. I am far happier with Samsung's compromise, it makes me willing to actually use the camera and feel confident I will get good pictures from it, where with rivals, even if I know I can get a decent photo, I also know I will have to faff so much I rarely have the patience to even bother. It must be said, that even these rival cameras which are technically better in terms of image quality (for example, Microsoft's high-end Lumia PureView models) are not very far ahead of the Galaxy S7 at all, while the Galaxy S7 is tons more fun to use and consistently able to produce images you're proud of. For those who do want to fine-tune their photography the Galaxy S7 does include a "Pro" mode for manual control for key features like focus, brightness, ISO, exposure, and more. Samsung Galaxy S7 EDGE Review: Software Of course the Samsung Galaxy S7 EDGE runs Android Marshmallow with a new build of TouchWiz over the top of it, but with that said it doesn't seem massively different from the build currently rolling out to the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 EDGE. As with that build, there are enhancements to the EDGE display functions, which now allow for gesture controls and a wider selection of apps to be used - there's also more room on the edge for more apps, shortcuts and info to be displayed. Samsung Galaxy S7 EDGE Review: Price & Availability Major UK networks have pricing plan details for both the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge. The following network deals are for 24 month contracts for the 32GB Galaxy S7 edge and on all mentioned networks it can be purchased in either Black Onyx or Gold Platinum colour options. EE - £9.99 Up-front and £54.99 per month O2 - £9.99 Up-front and £51 per month Vodafone - £9 Up-front and £56 per month Three - £49 Up-front and £47 per month - Pre-order by March 6 to receive handset by March 8; three days earlier than general release on March 11. Samsung Galaxy S7 EDGE Review: Conclusion A tremendously pleasing smartphone to use. It's been a while since I test-drove something I didn't want to give back, but the Galaxy S7 EDGE fits into that category quite comfortably. It looks sharp, feels reassuringly expensive and robust in the hand, the camera experience is an absolute joy. Performance is what you hope for from a flagship; it's fast, smooth and responsive, while the battery life is amongst the best available. The software is as close to stock Android as Samsung has ever come and as a result is one of the most hassle-free Samsung Galaxy devices I've used to date. Fancy picking yourself up a bargain? Check out how much the Galaxy S6 EDGE is over at Amazon! UPDATE: A Note On Buying Reconditioned Galaxy S6 EDGE Handsets Reconditioned phones are phones that have been used, but have been rejigged, wiped and treated and, for all intents and purposes, look brand new. The best thing about reconditioned phones is that they’re A LOT cheaper than buying new. How cheap? Very cheap – you can pick up a “certified reconditioned” – meaning, the thing looks as good as new – Samsung Galaxy S6 EDGE 32GB for just $319 via Gazelle. That handset is $780 SIM-free new; so that's a massive saving. And when you're saving literally hundreds of dollars, who cares if the handset isn't new, right? As long as it looks new, that's all that counts!  Or, if you’d prefer something newer, like the Galaxy S7, you can nab one of them for $368. That’s a huge saving on buying the handset new and if you’re looking at saving some cash in 2017, as well as getting out of the contract-loop, then you definitely need to consider this route. Latest Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge deals: I’ve bought a few reconditioned phones over the years and I’ve never had any issues. I even bought a reconditioned MacBook Pro back in 2012 and that bad boy is still running like a champ now. Gazelle is one of the best and most trusted places on the web to buy reconditioned, so if you’re after a cheaper way to acquire a flagship phone or a tablet or a Mac check out their site and see what’s on offer.

Google is now offering four free months of Google Play Music for new subscribers Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/26 2:17pm PDTMay 26, 2017 82 Plus 1 on G+ 614 Share on Facebook 102 Share on Twitter Total Shares798 Google News Right now it looks like Google is running a special offer for Google Play Music. New subscribers that sign up here can get four free months of service instead of the usual three. No telling how long this offer might last, so if you have been considering subscribing, now might be the time to do it. It could save you an extra $10. Again, this particular offer is only for new subscribers. I've been a fan of Play Music for a long time, though the device removal limit does get in the way when you switch between devices and ROMs as often as I do. Being able to mix your own library with those of a service also comes in handy. That way I can continue to support artists I am passionate about, without eschewing the larger selection of a subscription offering for the purposes of content discovery, all while being able to fill the gaps in that library. There are a lot of different music services out there, but if you're interested combining your curated library with music available via a subscription, then your options are limited. Spotify does allow you to play back locally stored files, which is convenient, but it isn't quite the same. Amazon also allows you to upload your music for playback via Amazon Music, and with Amazon Prime membership, you get a small library of streaming music to go along with that. For $10 a month ($8 for Prime members) you can access their full library as well. But, Google Play Music has a great interface and plugs nicely into all the other Google services we love. Maybe with this new offer, it's time you gave Google Play Music a chance? After all, even if it doesn't end up working out, you still got four free months of music out of the deal.

Ailín Ó’S In Ireland Vodafone have a partnership with Spotify whereby it costs €5 standard instead of €10 regardless of if you're a student or not, they even bundle it with some of their plans. Vodafone do the same in some other countries they operate in (not all). Maybe see if any network in your country has a partnership like that? Worth a shot! Ben Oh yeah I'm on EE in the UK and I've got Apple Music for free for 6 months but like iTunes is a massive stinking turd.

Forget vega #getEVGA Why google play music isn't available in my country ? Ailín Ó’S Try Apple Music? They seem to be just about everywhere. Iamsecond And this is why Apple continue to dominate, because Apple are truly interested in being an international company whereas Google is just playing at it. Such a shame xyz Because Google sucks. Bartek Juszczak My GPM radio's are so good these days I love that Google is so into AI. Whether It's just "I'm being lucky" or radio from a specific song, band or album they very rarely disappoint me these days. I just make sure to thumbs up if it plays a song I particularly love. I am a student and could go cheaper with spotify but the AI generated playlists have me locked in. If it's £5 cheaper but I'm not gonna enjoy it nearly as much then it's not really a good deal. AndTheWorldMayNeverKnow I used the 3 or 4 months free trial during the holidays then bought the family plan for $14.99 a month. 4 people in my family us it and it works great, the app could use some tweaks but it's really good overall. paev If you listen to main stream music it doesn't really matter what service to use. However, if you like something unusual, weird or other languages then Google is a way to go. I found bands on Google music that Spotify displayed as not found. Google also have new synth bands that Spotify doesn't. I'm for Google too. Daniel I discovered that GPM is kinda like a music label. I once went to a section of Google play explaining how indie artists can use GPM like a music label as long as they own all their rights. Ryne Hager Ultraista (among others) keeps me using Google Play Music as well as Spotify. Carson Saldanha Does anyone else who activated the Play Music trial have YouTube Red working as well? My YT Red doesn't seem to be enabled while my Play Music is. Michael Carr I spotted a similar offer a couple of months ago, and I took it after a day or two's thought. Just last week, I moved directly into a family plan. PewPewYoureDead It's hard to recommend Google Play Music until they revamp the UI. Margaritas Ante Porcos Google Music is the only choice in some markets, like Russia, where no Spotify or Pandora are available. There are too many shortcomings in Google Music and Google never shows interest in making services better than below average. I really wonder why Google refuses to become the best at anything. Real magic here. Pixel syndrome all the way. Yet Google Music is on my phone and I use it because there's no choice whatsoever. Rob You answered your own question. If there's no alternative, then they don't have any incentive to improve the service. SupahNin10doh Stupid Dorito logo... Raymond Berger Huh, I just subscribed to the trial but you youtube red hasn't kicked in yet. Any idea how long it takes? Iamsecond If you live in the UK, about 2 years so far h20ray Google Play Music is currently available in select territories and for select account types. Umang Ladia I'm only seeing 2 months offer in India, anybody can confirm? Mohammad Ovais Yeah, same for me. Maybe it's region limited. Isolde I think you need to open the link in a browser, if you open it in the app it's just the normal 2 months. bligui Confirmed need to open it from link and it works Manoj | Blogging Triggers Is Google Music really worth to it? We have better alternatives Sathiya Moorthy Karan I came across a great post, it seems to be so cool http://developeit.net/android-news-image-scanner-finder/ Zachariah Mann It only shows up as 2 free months for me.

Does it matter if I'm opening it on a computer or web page? Jefferson Rodrigues I don't know. Mikael Jakobsson Should mabye joine premium at Google Music if that coste like $2 max a month dont understand why they should take as mutch as someone some has app or Win32 software to PC so music controllers one they keyboards works. Tab out frome a game for pause music when the round is over is just bad. Arif Gürü And stil isnt available on Turkey xyz "No telling how long this offer might last, so if you have been considering subscribing, now might be the time to do it." No thanks, I'll just use YouTube. Only thing YT needs is an option to play audio only so I can save a wee bit more data when I don't need video. Cai Copley Nope. If it wasn't for the fact work pays for Spotify Premium and the fact Spotify has Crossfade to emulate a DJ system, maybe I'd give it a whirl. bligui Not working any more to bad Follow Android Police 1.49M 472k 145k 119k Latest Deals 9 [Deal Alert] Chromecast Ultra is $59.99 ($10 off) at Google Store, Best Buy, B&H and others 2017/06/04 12:16pm PDTJun 4, 2017 13 [Deal Alert] Google Home is $109 ($20 off) at Best Buy, Google Store, B&H, and others 2017/06/04 10:07am PDTJun 4, 2017 12 [Deal Alert] Kick off the weekend with 24 temporarily free and 52 on-sale apps 2017/06/03 6:50pm PDTJun 3, 2017 18 [Deal Alert] Get a Nextbit Robin for $129.99 on eBay 2017/06/03 9:39am PDTJun 3, 2017 33 [Deal Alert] A Stork's Journey is currently free on Google Play Movies & TV 2017/06/01 10:50pm PDTJun 1, 2017 Latest Poll How many photos are on your Google Photos account?

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Saturday, 27 May 2017 | MYT 1:00 PM Google’s employee-run email list tracks bias complaints The “Yes, at Google” newsletter is less than eight months old but has picked up subscribers and interest in the past few months as other companies have faced more public allegations of sexual harassment. — Reuters At most companies, if you think you’ve witnessed sexual harassment, sexism, bigotry or racism, there’s one way to get it addressed: going to human resources.  At Google, there's another way to air your grievance: submitting your complaint to an employee-run message board that's curated into a weekly email.  The list, called “Yes, at Google,” is a grassroots effort to collect anonymous submissions at Google and parent Alphabet Inc and communicate them across the company, according to five current employees who receive the emails.  “Yes, at Google” tracks allegations of unwelcome behaviour at work in an attempt to make the company more inclusive, said the employees, who did not want to be named because they were not authorised to speak about internal company matters. Since starting in October, more than 15,000 employees – 20% of the company's workforce – have subscribed, according to two of those people.  Google management is aware of the list. “We work really hard to promote and preserve a culture of respect and inclusion,” a Google spokesperson said in a statement. “Our employees have numerous ways to raise issues – both negative and positive – with us, including through grassroots transparency efforts like this one. We take concerns seriously and take appropriate measures to address them.”  The list is run by a group of workers across different product areas, according to a person familiar with the list, though it's not clear who runs the list and how or whether the submissions are vetted before being distributed.  Usually, the people in the complaints are not named, though one submission described an instance when, during a large company meeting in late April, Alphabet executive chairman Eric Schmidt allegedly interrupted chief financial officer Ruth Porat when she had a question addressed to her, which the post categorised as a “gender-related” complaint. A person who attended the meeting said Schmidt answered the question to make a joke. Messages sometimes include job titles and other details.  Google, along with other tech companies, is facing growing pressure from diversity advocates and the media to change the gender and racial makeup of its workforce, which is largely white and Asian men. But inside company walls, employees are also speaking up about what they see as unfair treatment. The weekly e-mail – whose title is meant to suggest that yes, these things happen at Google, even if you don't see them – is one way employees are pushing for awareness and change.  Google management doesn't control or influence the content, though the list's organisers sometimes ask teams or particular employees to respond to an item before publication, according to a person familiar with the list who was not authorised to speak about it. Executives have touted the list internally as a way that Google is trying to make its workplace welcome to all kinds of employees.  In February, former Uber engineer Susan Fowler wrote a widely read blog post detailing alleged sexual harassment and other mistreatment at Uber (in response to Fowler's allegations, Uber is conducting an internal investigation into its workplace culture). After her post, a group of Google vice-presidents sent staff an e-mail that listed resources that might help prevent similar things happening at Google. “Yes, at Google” was included as a resource.  A dispatch from early May viewed by Bloomberg listed dozens of alleged incidents. One person reported a manager to HR for allegedly “joking about raping one of his direct reports,” the e-mail said. “He was promoted.”  Another allegation: “A colleague started a meeting off by making a joke that called a woman in the adjacent meeting room '€some random bitch.’”  In another, a writer alleges that a “Noogler” – new Googler – was invited by an engineer to get drinks with a group of colleagues off campus. It was her second week of work. “Upon arriving, discovered there was no group,” the email said. “Subsequently informed by the engineer that she was expected to ‘sleep with everyone' because that's the culture here.”  The message was accompanied by this note from the newsletter operators: “Per the Employee Relations Team, this is an example of the kind of issue that we need and want to look into as this behaviour is unacceptable and contrary to our Code of Conduct and Policy Against Harassment.” The e-mail urged anyone who knows of the identity of the people involved or the time and place it occurred to share it with the company, “so we can look into this matter and address it appropriately.”  The e-mail also refers to some alleged incidents as examples of when employees should formally raise concerns with the company. “A male Googler drank excessively at an offsite event and touched a few different female Googlers in a manner that made them uncomfortable, made inappropriate comments, and followed two women back to their hotel room and told them ‘I'm following you,'” the email said. “Thanks to Googlers who came forward with information about these incidents, we investigated, substantiated the concerns and terminated the Googler's employment.”  Google management will try to respond to some complaints if they are specific enough, according to a person familiar with the list.  A list like “Yes, at Google” introduces business risks, said Peter Cappelli, a management professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton Business School. If a submission were proven libellous, that could be a legal complication for the company. And having a fifth of a company's workforce reading a weekly collection of complaints could amplify discontent among employees, he said.  In 2014, Google became one of the first high-profile tech companies to release employee diversity figures, starting an industry trend. The company's proportions have not improved much in three years – 81% of its technical staff is male, as of last year, and less than 6% are races other than Asian or white. Google runs implicit bias training internally aimed at addressing some of subtle forms of prejudice that persist inside workplaces.  Google is currently under investigation by the US Department of Labour for alleged systemic pay discrimination against its female employees. Google denied the allegations and said that its yearly analysis of pay across men and women found no gender pay gap.  ”Yes, at Google” wouldn't be the first time employees at the search giant organised to raise awareness about perceived inequality. In 2015, Erica Joy Baker, then a site reliability engineer at the company, started a spreadsheet where employees could submit their salaries and titles to compare them against others. She said that she was called into meetings and told that upper managers were not pleased with the spreadsheet's existence. She quit in 2015 for a job at workplace chat service Slack.  “Our policy is not to comment on individual or former employees, but we can confirm that we regularly run analysis of compensation, promotion, and performance to ensure that they are equitable with no pay gap. Employees are free to share their salaries with one another if they choose,” Google said in a statement regarding salary-sharing in 2015.  The “Yes, at Google” newsletter is less than eight months old but has picked up subscribers and interest in the past few months as other companies have faced more public allegations of sexual harassment. Google also faced blowback in February when Uber said it asked for the resignation of Amit Singhal, a senior executive, after discovering he was the subject of a sexual harassment claim when he worked at Google. Singhal denied the allegation.  Not all the complaints in the Google mailing list include allegations of misconduct such as sexual harassment. Other entries allege workplace comments that might not be obviously offensive to everyone but made some employees uncomfortable, said the current employees.  One submission calls out a comment someone wrote in an internal referral that a job candidate "is definite [sic] one of the smartest girls I've met.” Another: “Coworker to me:‘You know why the schools in Pleasanton are so good, right? Because of all the Chinese people.'”  One employee said that the hairdressers who work at the Google campus sometimes say, “I've never encountered hair like yours before,” which the employee said “comes across as code for ‘I'm not trained to cut the hair of people of your race.'"  One employee said that during a one-on-one performance review with a manager, he was told that his rating dropped from “Exceeds” to “Meets” because he didn't get as much done while on paternity leave. In another, a female subordinate said that her manager asked her to do work that he then took credit for when passing on the work to a higher-ranking director. A female employee was allegedly called a “princess” for favouring salad over burgers. Another employee claims that new desks at a particular office location only come designed for right-handed workers.  The mailing list also includes actions or changes that employees found praiseworthy, according to staff that have viewed them. The drinks menu at weekly all-hands meetings were updated to include a wider range of non-alcoholic beverages, and the men's restrooms in the San Francisco offices have menstruation products to accommodate men who have periods. When YouTube rolled out a data tool with a name that some employees outside the US found offensive, the name was quickly changed.   Cappelli, the management professor, said that despite the risks that such a list poses, a collection of complaints from employees is also a valuable resource for management – especially about sensitive topics that employees may be reluctant to talk about.  Keeping an eye on a list similar to Google's “could be a pretty smart thing for an employer to do,” he said. “You can find out stuff that's going on without having to do surveys. Employees don't necessarily trust hotlines, and they certainly don't always trust going to their supervisor with problems.” — Bloomberg Related Stories You May Be Interested After London attack, Facebook says aims to be hostile environment for terrorists The need to educate investors on ponzi and pyramid scheme Samsung Galaxy Tab S3: Sleek and stylish 5 superpowers every mum has 6 beautiful cities to add to your bucket list How to avoid dehydration during Ramadan Others Also Read Better connectivity in Labis AirAsia warns of ticket scams U.S. Secretary of State Tillerson says China needs to step on North Korea advertisement Latest News Apple to software developers: We have new hardware for your apps European telecoms firms pin hopes on Esports video game gladiators China agrees to delay electric car quota by a year Google’s Chrome browser to start blocking annoying ads next year Bansen Labs adapter allows gamers with disabilities to connect with technology Most Viewed in Tech Bentley on Demand is like Uber for the uber rich Here’s how to know if someone’s blocked you on WhatsApp Toyota-supported flying car hopes to light the Tokyo 2020 Olympic flame Samsung Galaxy Tab S3: Sleek and stylish Google’s Chrome browser to start blocking annoying ads next year China agrees to delay electric car quota by a year Microsoft’s weapon in high-stakes cloud-computing battle with Amazon?

Anyone with the corresponding app on their device can pay for goods and services with a simple tap of their phone against a compatible point-of-sale terminal with near-field communication, or NFC. Here’s everything you need to know about Android Pay, including the places and banks that support it. PayPal joins Android Pay Android Pay is an excellent replacement for your credit or debit cards but what about your PayPal account? Starting May 24, Android Pay users running version 4.4 or higher of the mobile operating system will be able to link PayPal to their profile. Previously, the only way to use the popular web-based payment platform in-store was through a PayPal debit card, or by inputting your phone number and PIN into one of the few compatible terminals out in the wild. To get started paying with PayPal from your Android device, tap the button at the bottom right like you normally would to add a card, then select “Add other payment methods.” PayPal may ask you to load funds to your account if you have not already. If you do not see the option yet, it may take a little while before the update rolls out to your device. Additionally, it is important to note PayPal support is only live for U.S. users at this time. Android Pay is currently only able to pull from your PayPal balance for transactions but eventually, any cards you have saved on your PayPal account will also be supported. International release Android Pay made its debut on the global stage when it launched in the U.K. in May 2016, and the service has slowly continued to expand since. It’s now available in Japan, Ireland, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, and Poland. At Google I/O 2017, the company announced the service will arrive in at least another five countries before the end of the year: Brazil, Canada, Russia, Spain, and Taiwan. We don’t have details on specific launch partners for each territory but check back for updates as more information becomes available. Canada Android Pay could launch in Canada as soon as May 31, according to MobileSyrup, which cites anonymous sources. At the moment, it’s not officially known which banks and card companies will support the platform when it debuts. However, some clues dating back to late last year hint at support from Interac, one of Canada’s debit payment processing networks. This was revealed by 9to5Google when it investigated the Android Pay app back in December. At the time, some users also reported they were able to add and complete transactions with certain Visa cards through Android Pay. This caused many to believe the service had officially been launched, but Google elaborated shortly afterward, claiming that it wasn’t quite ready for prime time yet. Since then, some of the cards that were working have had support removed. Russia Prior to Google I/O, four banks were named in relation to Android Pay’s Russian launch: Sberbank, Alfa, Raiffeisen, and Tinkoff. These banks could be the first to receive the service when it launches over the coming months. The report comes courtesy of Russian news sites by way of AndroidPolice, which also relays that Visa recently updated its Russian support pages with references to Android Pay, before removing them from the site. In tandem with Google’s confirmation at I/O, this means launch could be imminent. Belgium Google is officially bringing Android Pay to Belgium. The company announced the news in a blog post, which highlights that the service will be usable in as many as 85,000 institutions. It will work with both MasterCard and Visa and supports three major banks — BNP, Fintro, and Hello Bank. Not only that, but the company says that CBC, KBC, and KBC Brussels are all on the way. Japan Contactless and mobile payments are already widely used in Japan, and on December 12, Android Pay becomes the latest option for shoppers. However, it has launched with Rakuten Edy, an eMoney service accepted in more than 470,000 locations, rather than local banks. Operated through the usual Android Pay app, you create an Edy card or use an existing one, ready to use in supporting stores. In 2017, Google says to expect more payment options, including Visa and Mastercard, through its cooperation with local payment specialists FeliCa Networks. Ireland On December 6, Android Pay made its way to Ireland, and it promises compatibility “at thousands of retail locations throughout Ireland that accept contactless payments.” From McDonald’s to supermarket Tesco to book retailer Eason, there are plenty of places in which Europeans can now use Android Pay. Here is a list of places where Android Pay is now accepted in Ireland. New Zealand In November, New Zealand received access to Android Pay, and according to Google, it will be available at a number of common locations, including The Warehouse, Domino’s, McDonald’s, etc. As of right now, it only supports the BNZ Flexi Debit Visa card, but it will expand to more services as time goes on. Poland Poland got Android Pay in November, and Google says it’s available at more than 400,000 retail locations such as Costa Coffee, Carrefour, and Rossman. You can add your Mastercard or Visa debit or credit cards from the following Polish banks: Alior Bank, Bank Zachodni WBK, and T-Mobile Banking Services. Google says support for mBank will come soon, as well as other banks in the coming months. The payment service will also be available in various apps soon, including Allegro, Ceneo, Fancy, iTaxi.pl, and Uber. Hong Kong In October, Android Pay launched in Hong Kong, with a related blog post announcement noting that the service would be accepted “at over 5,000 locations in Hong Kong where contactless payments are accepted, including stores such as at 7-Eleven, Circle K, Fortress, Mannings, Maxim’s Cakes, MX, McDonald’s, Pacific Coffee, ParknShop, SmarTone, Watsons, Wellcome, and more.” Moreover, it also works in several apps including Boutir Collect, Deliveroo, Kaligo, Klook, Snaptee, and coming soon, Uber. You can check here to see all the supported banks in Hong Kong, including Hang Seng Bank, DBS Bank, Dah Sing Bank, the Bank of East Asia, Standard Chartered Bank, and more. Australia In Australia, Google has listed an impressive number of supported banks — more than 25 including ANZ, Beyond Bank, and Macquarie. Unfortunately, ANZ is the only one out of the top four banks in Australia to support the payment service. To see the list of supported Australian banks, check here. Aussies will also soon be able to use Android Pay within select apps such as Catch of the Day, Deliveroo, Domino’s, EatNow, Hotel Tonight, Kogan.com and more. That means speedier checkout times in apps as you won’t have to type out all your credit card information. Singapore In late June, Singapore became the third country to get Android Pay. It’s compatible with any contactless terminal in the country and supports loyalty cards and credit card rewards programs. The service is compatible with MasterCard and Visa cards from many of the country’s largest institutions, including DBS Bank, Standard Chartered Bank, OCBC Bank, POSB Bank, and UOB. You can check the full list of supported banks in Singapore here. United Kingdom Google’s first financial partners in the U.K. are the Bank of Scotland, First Direct, Halifax, HSBC, Lloyds Bank, Nationwide, MBNA, and M&S Bank. The search giant recently added Santander, RBS, Ulster Bank, and NatWest to the list. Both MasterCard and Visa debit and credit cards from co-operating banks will work, and TSB customers should know only selected account types can use the service. Even though it supports Apple Pay, it doesn’t look like Barclays will ever support Android Pay. The second-largest U.K. bank launched its own NFC payments service called Contactless Mobile. You can check this list to see which banks support Android Pay in the U.K. Retailers that will accept Android Pay payments include Costa Coffee and Starbucks, Boots, Waitrose, Aldi, Superdrug, and KFC. Plus, like Apple Pay, transport for London’s ticketing system will support it. Various shopping apps such as Deliveroo, Fancy, Kickstarter, Zara, Takeaway.com, and Hotel Tonight will offer Android Pay as a payment option. The contactless payment restriction of £30 remains in place, but in some situations, you’ll be able to spend up to £100 provided you authorize the transaction using a fingerprint or PIN code. SUPPORT IN THE U.S. All four major banks in the U.S. support Android Pay — that’s Chase Bank, Wells Fargo, Citibank, and Bank of America. Chase Bank grossly lagged behind the rest of the major U.S. banks, but as of September 2016, it has finally added support for Android Pay. Of course, plenty of other banks are also lagging behind, but now the likes of BMO Harris have finally added support for the service. In addition to adding your credit and debit cards to the service, Bank of America is installing NFC-enabled ATMs around the country — this would allow you to access your bank account to withdraw cash just by tapping your phone. Other U.S. institutions, integrations In May 2017, Google announced support for 71 new banks and credit unions, including 1st Constitution Bank, Central State Bank, and more. If your bank or credit union didn’t already support Android Pay, it may well do so now. You can check out the full list of supported banks and credit unions for yourself here. Before that, Google added 46 new banks to its roster, but they are names many will not recognize, except for Fifth Third Bank. Some of the others, according to Android Police, include the Alaska USA Federal Credit Union, Greenfield Banking Company, and the Peoples Federal Credit Union. You can check to see if your bank supports the service here. Most banks that already support Apple Pay will back Google’s service since both use similar NFC technology for payments — other top institutions include PNC, Capital One, TD Bank, HSBC, American Express, Ally Bank, and USAA. In mid-December, the company added support for 31 additional rural banks and credit unions across the contiguous United States. They include Allegacy Federal Credit Union, the Bank of Walterboro, Canyon State Credit Union, First Piedmont Federal Savings, Jackson Community Federal Credit Union, Northeast Georgia Bank, San Francisco FCU, USC Credit Union, Verve, and Washington Trust Bank. The expanded support comes on the heels of 19 additions earlier in December 2016. These include 1st Advantage Federal Credit Union, ACU of Texas, Alpine Credit Union, Alternatives FCU, Bank of the Ozarks, Union State Bank of Fargo, and Valley Federal Credit Union. MasterCard, Visa, American Express, and Discover support Android Pay. Sites that support Visa Checkout and Masterpass will soon be able to handle Android Pay as well, thanks to a strategic partnership. You’ll be able to use your fingerprint to confirm payments as well, and Visa Checkout and Masterpass customers will be able to link their accounts with Android Pay as well. The integration will roll out in early 2017. Mobile banking app integration Android Pay is now integrating with several banking apps around the world to make it a little easier to use Android Pay. Now, many customers will be able to add cards to Android Pay from their mobile banking apps at the tap of a button. At the launch of the new feature, there are a few banks that are supported, including Bank of America, Discover, Bank of New Zealand, mBank, and USAA. In-App and mobile web purchases Although you’ll probably use Android Pay mostly in shops, it will also let you make in-app purchases. When you’re about to purchase something in an app that supports the service, you’ll see a button that will allow you to pay using Android Pay, eliminating the need to get your wallet and pull out your credit or debit card. At the moment, Google has listed more than a dozen apps that support in-app purchases with Android Pay including Lyft, OpenTable, Hotel Tonight, Instacart, and, most recently, Etsy. If you make purchases via the Chrome Browser app on your phone, you’re in luck. Google is adding support for Android Pay for certain sites, making the checkout process less of a hassle. It currently works with a handful of sites such as Groupon and 1-800-Flowers. The integration with Visa Checkout and Masterpass is sure to boost the number of sites that support Android Pay as well. “Just like in stores and in apps, Android Pay does not share actual account numbers with merchants, so users can shop online with confidence, knowing that Android Pay keeps their card number secure,” according to the Android blog. COMPATIBLE DEVICES AND SECURITY To use Android Pay, you’ll need an NFC-enabled smartphone running Android 4.4 KitKat and above. It will work at stores with NFC contactless payment terminals. Like most NFC payment systems, Android Pay comes with all the necessary security, including a way to shut down devices that have been stolen so nobody can use your card. The system uses tokenization, which processes transactions via individual random account numbers, rather than your actual credit or debit card account number. In-app purchases are as safe as its NFC contactless counterpart. Rewards and loyalty As Android Pay is meant to replace your wallet, it’s expanding to include all those other cards you would typically have on you as well — gift and loyalty cards. Google has been expanding its partnerships, and as such the company says Android Pay is the first mobile wallet to “deeply integrate” with Uber’s Payment Rewards program. Walgreens says its Balance Rewards members can now apply their loyalty account via Android Pay at checkout. If you’re a member, all you need to do is add your Balance Rewards card to the Android Pay app. When you’re at the register, hold up your Android smartphone to the NFC terminal to apply your rewards information — when you’re ready to pay, hold the smartphone up again at the same place. You’ll have to add your credit or debit card beforehand to complete the purchase, of course. Stores with NFC terminals support Android Pay Like all other forms of NFC payment, Android Pay will be accepted in more than one million stores across the United States, including Toys ‘R’ Us, GameStop, Subway, Whole Foods, and more. Walmart does not accept contactless payments, yet.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Saturday, 27 May 2017 | MYT 12:00 PM Digital wallet services gain rising acceptance by george avalos The most common mobile-payment activities include paying bills through a mobile phone or web browser, buying items or digital content remotely with a phone, and paying for goods in a store with a phone, according to the Federal Reserve Bank in a report titled Consumers and Mobile Financial Services 2016. — Reuters SAN JOSE: Money and wallets simply aren't what they used to be.  Tech giants' card-less payment services – including Apple Pay, Android Pay from Google and Samsung Pay – aim to ease the path to the truly digital wallet, and researchers project huge growth in adoption by retailers and consumers. Even staid financial giants such as Wells Fargo and Bank of America are behind a push to encourage and enable customers to access ATMs without their debit cards.  Yet the digital wallet business has gotten off to a rough start, said Bay Area-based analyst Trip Chowdhry, managing director with Global Equities Research.  "There have been many false starts in this industry," Chowdhry said. "The current payment methods are intrusive, and they are not seamless."  Even so, card-less payment services are here to stay.  "Mobile proximity payments, enabled though near-field-communications, are projected to vastly increase to US$118bil (RM503.68bil) in 2018, up from US$3.5bil (RM14.91bil) in 2014," according to a report by Statista, a web-based data and statistics company. "Some of the benefits of mobile payments include the speed of payment, the convenience as well as the integration with pre-existing loyalty and coupon programs."  These benefits point to a brave new world of virtual wallets.  The most common mobile-payment activities include paying bills through a mobile phone or web browser, buying items or digital content remotely with a phone, and paying for goods in a store with a phone, according to the Federal Reserve Bank in a report titled Consumers and Mobile Financial Services 2016.  As of December 2016, Apple Pay led the way in North American retailers' adoption of mobile-payment systems, with 36% acceptance, according to Statista. PayPal had 34% acceptance, Mastercard PayPass had 25%, Android Pay had 24%, Visa CheckOut had 20% and Samsung Pay had 18%, the report said.  One of the next steps, analysts say, is to make payments seamless for the consumer, and to make it easy for shoppers to pick up items in stores without lining up at check stands.  This sort of convenience is already available in a different industry that new technologies have disrupted: "Uber and Lyft enable users to simply get out of the car at the end of the journey, while the app seamlessly processes the fare in the background," Sunnyvale-based technology company Rambus noted in a report.  The technology providers also need to overcome consumers' worries about security.  Campbell-based market researcher Creative Strategies recently studied digital wallets to assess barriers to greater adoption of the services.  "We found that fears about security, trusting in the apps, are the primary concerns," said Ben Bajarin, a principal analyst. "Consumers don't quite buy the story that they are secure. They are concerned that anything in a digital form can be stolen."  Bajarin said Apple, Android and Samsung mobile payment technologies all encrypt users' information, securing their credit card details.  "Compared to a physical credit card or physical wallet that can be stolen, digital wallets are secure," he said.  Here is a brief look at some of the technology leaders in mobile payments.  Apple Pay  Apple Pay is a free digital wallet and mobile payment service that can be used to make in-person payments and is compatible with an array of contact-less terminals. The system is live in 15 countries, including the United States and Canada, along with United Kingdom, France, Russia, China, Japan and several other European and Asian countries.  Q: How many retailers accept your service today? A: Tens of millions of customers are now using Apple Pay, and more than 13 million contact-less enabled locations exist in the countries where the service is live, Apple said in a statement. More than 4.5 million locations now accept Apple Pay in the US.  Retailers that support Apple Pay include Best Buy, B&H Photo, Bloomingdale's, Chevron, Disney, Dunkin' Donuts, GameStop, Jamba Juice, Kohl's, Lucky, McDonald's, Office Depot, Petco, Sprouts, Staples, KFC, Trader Joe's, Walgreens and Whole Foods, according to the MacRumors site.  Q: What improvements are you making to the service? A: Apple didn't disclose any upcoming upgrades. But Apple Chief Executive Officer Timothy Cook told analysts during a conference call this month: "Apple Pay is experiencing phenomenal traction. We're seeing strong, growing usage as points of acceptance expand, with transaction volume up 450 percent in the US alone."  Android Pay  Google developed the Android Pay digital wallet platform to power tap-to-pay purchases on mobile devices so customers can make payments with Android-based phones, tablets, or watches. Android Pay uses the near-field communications technology to exchange bank card information so funds can be transferred to the retailer.  Q: How many retailers accept your service today? A: "We don't have this number available to share," said Genevieve Park, a Google spokeswoman. However, some of the retailers using Android Pay are Best Buy, BJ's Wholesale Club, Bloomingdale's, Coca Cola, Dunkin' Donuts, Game Stop, Jamba Juice, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Macy's, Meijer, Panera Bread, Subway, Trader Joe's, Walgreens, Wegmans and Whole Foods.  Q: What improvements are you making to the service? A: A Google alliance with PayPal enables people to tap their PayPal accounts to make payments using their Android phones; Google has teamed up with multiple banks, including Bank of America and USAA Bank, to add bank cards to the Android Pay platform; and Gmail users can send money as an attachment in an email, the company said in a statement.  "Android Pay is a mobile wallet that allows Android users to save their credit, debit and loyalty cards to their phone and pay easily in-store, in-app, and on the mobile web," Google said.  Samsung Pay  Samsung Pay uses near-field communication technology and supports more than 500 banks and credit unions, which together represent more than 85% of the US debit card and credit card market.  Q: How many major retailers accept your service today? A: Samsung Pay works at more than 90% of the top 250 retailers and the vast majority of merchants, including small, local businesses, Samsung said. Because Samsung Pay supports both Near-Field Communications (NFC) and Magnetic Secure Transmission (MST) technologies, Samsung Pay is accepted almost anywhere you can swipe or tap your credit card, it said.  Samsung Pay is driving toward the goal of universal merchant acceptance, which is critical to consumer adoption, Samsung said.  Q: What improvements are you making to the service? A: Samsung has provided new incentives to help customers reach for their phones every time they go through checkout. Samsung Rewards, for example, serves as the loyalty platform for the entire Samsung ecosystem, working much like standard credit card points programs.  "With Samsung Rewards rapidly accelerating consumer adoption of mobile payments, and Samsung Pay's ability to work almost anywhere you can swipe a credit card unlike other solutions, we know that Samsung Pay is uniquely positioned to lead the mobile payments industry into the future," said Nana Murugesan, general manager of services and new business at Samsung Electronics America.  Wells Fargo  Instead of a physical card, customers can now use a mobile Wells Fargo app to choose card-free ATM access and then obtain a one-time token for that session to conduct transactions at the machine.  "Wells Fargo is the first large bank in the U.S. to have card-less ATM technology on our entire fleet," said Ruben Pulido, a Wells Fargo spokesman.  Bank of America  Bank of America focuses on digital wallets for its card-less ATM services.  "The way we deployed card-less technologies is we are accepting all digital wallets, including Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Android Pay," said Charles Liu, chief of branch transformation, ATM innovation and market strategy. "We have enabled this so all of the digital wallets will work with our ATMs. You simply place your phone near an ATM terminal and they communicate with each other."  This sort of access is available at more than half of the Bank of America ATMs in the US and can be activated by uploading the bank card information to a digital wallet.  Retailers  Macy's and Bloomingdale's both accept Apple Pay, Android Pay and Samsung Pay, said Orlando Veras, a spokesman for Macy's Inc, whose subsidiaries include the two department store chains.  The only digital wallet Walmart accepts is Walmart Wallet, the retailer said in an e-mailed response. — San Jose Mercury News/Tribune News Service  Related Stories You May Be Interested If a game key bargain looks too good to be true, it probably is The need to educate investors on ponzi and pyramid scheme Samsung Galaxy Tab S3: Sleek and stylish 5 superpowers every mum has 6 beautiful cities to add to your bucket list How to avoid dehydration during Ramadan Others Also Read Barred from boarding Williams set to face Lions, Perofeta gets first start As Russia probe grinds on, Trump struggles to gain traction on agenda advertisement Latest News Apple to software developers: We have new hardware for your apps European telecoms firms pin hopes on Esports video game gladiators China agrees to delay electric car quota by a year Google’s Chrome browser to start blocking annoying ads next year Bansen Labs adapter allows gamers with disabilities to connect with technology Most Viewed in Tech Bentley on Demand is like Uber for the uber rich Here’s how to know if someone’s blocked you on WhatsApp Toyota-supported flying car hopes to light the Tokyo 2020 Olympic flame Samsung Galaxy Tab S3: Sleek and stylish Google’s Chrome browser to start blocking annoying ads next year China agrees to delay electric car quota by a year Microsoft’s weapon in high-stakes cloud-computing battle with Amazon?

Meizu M5 Note review: Do not buy this phone Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/01/18 9:15am PDTJan 18, 2017 19 Plus 1 on G+ 43 Share on Facebook 56 Share on Twitter Total Shares118 Meizu News Phone Reviews Reviews Article Contents 1 Specs 2 The Good 3 The Not So Good 4 Design and materials 5 Camera 6 Performance 7 Software 8 Battery 9 Conclusion It would be understandable if you have never heard of Meizu. While it is one of the top electronics companies in mainland China, the company isn't massively popular outside of the country. The M5 Note is the newest device to come out of Meizu, and like many of its recent phones, is being sold internationally. From the spec sheet, the M5 Note looks like a solid device. A Mediatek Helio P10 CPU, 1080p LCD screen, at least 3GB of RAM, a massive 4,000mAh battery. The price is perhaps most impressive, costing just 899 CNY for the base model - roughly $131 USD. For comparison, the Moto G4 Play with a Snapdragon 410, 720p display, and 2GB of RAM costs more at its regular price. With great specifications at an incredibly low price, the M5 Note almost seems too good to be true. Unfortunately, it is. Specs CPU MediaTek Helio P10 CPU GPU Mali-T860 GPU RAM 3/4GB Display 5.5" 1080p LCD Storage 16GB/32GB/64GB Battery 4,000mAh Cameras 13 MP Rear, 5 MP Front Software Flyme OS 5.2 (based on Android 6.0 Marshmallow) The Good Screen The 1080p display is probably the best feature of the M5 Note. Speakers The built-in speakers are firmly in the 'good enough' category. Ports There's a headphone jack. The Not So Good Software There are countless issues with Flyme OS, starting with no Google services being installed by default. Battery life The poor implementation of Google Play Services causes the battery life to plummet, even with light use. Notifications I could not receive notifications through Google Hangouts, among a few other apps. Ports (again) The M5 Note only has a MicroUSB port, not USB Type-C. Design and materials The M5 Note, as the name might imply, is a rather large phone. The device itself is roughly 154mm tall, 75mm wide, and 8mm thick - almost identical in size to the Pixel XL and now-discontinued Galaxy Note7. Besides the physical size, the first thing you might notice when holding the M5 Note is the weight. Whereas my Pixel is just 143 grams (5.04 oz), the Note is 175 grams (6.17 oz). The extra weight is largely thanks to the included 4,000mAh battery, which I'll get to later. Overall, I didn't really mind the extra weight, but it is certainly noticeable compared to most flagship devices. Aesthetically, the M5 Note seems closest to the iPhone 6S. It has the same reflective metal around the home button's edge, the same aluminum back, the same antenna bands, and so on. The speakers and headphone jack are in the exact same position as well. This premium look and feel (even if unoriginal) seems out of place on a budget phone, and it's one of the M5 Note's best qualities. That being said, the M5 Note is not a completely shameless copy. The large camera lens sits in the top center of the back casing, instead of the iPhone's top-left corner lens. Like most Android devices, the power button and volume rockers are on the same side. Annoyingly (or at least for me), the power button is positioned below the volume. Perhaps the strangest design choice on the M5 Note is the navigation buttons - or rather, lack thereof. The home button, much like on the iPhone, serves as the only means of navigating through the operating system. Pressing the button takes you to the home screen, swiping or tapping the button acts as the back button, and swiping up from the bottom of the display brings up recent applications. While this form of navigation is certainly bizarre, I got used to it fairly quickly. I would have preferred software navigation buttons, but I suppose it could be worse. Camera Previous Next The M5 Note has two cameras - a 13 MP rear camera and a 5 MP front camera. Both are unexceptional, as should be expected for a phone at this price point. Outdoor shots with enough light are usually good, such as the first photo, but still appear washed out. Inside/low-light photos often appear blurry and unfocused, even when capturing stationary objects with the M5 Note on a tripod. With many budget devices, a good camera is often a low priority, and it certainly was with the M5 Note. Performance As you may have noticed in the table above, the M5 Note is powered by the MediaTek Helio P10 CPU. The CPU has eight ARM Cortex A53 cores, clocked at 1.81GHz each. Graphics are handled by the Mali-T860 GPU, and depending on your model, the M5 Note has either 3GB or 4GB of RAM. There's also no USB Type-C port to be found - just microUSB. On the Geekbench 4 CPU test, the Meizu M5 Note scores 696 for single-core performance and 2118 for multi-core performance (full results here). The single-core score is dreadful, comparable to the Samsung Galaxy S4 (679) and Neuxs 7 2013 (660). The multi-core score fares a bit better, ranking close to the OnePlus X (2088) and LG G3 (2142). In day to day usage, I would describe the M5 Note as 'acceptable' in performance. Most apps do take a second or two to open, but overall the phone never felt bogged down or especially slow. Again, for roughly $131 USD, you shouldn't expect flagship-level speed. But what about games? Much like the CPU, the GPU is nothing to write home about. The 3DMark Sling Shot test running at 1080p with OpenGL ES 3.0 scored 498 (full results here). This places the phone alongside the LG Optimus G Pro (488), LG Stylus 2 Plus (510), and Oppo R9 (494). This should be enough to power through most games, with my test of GTA San Andreas only dropping frames when setting visual effects to the max. While I'm on the topic of hardware, let's talk band compatibility. Like many Chinese smartphones, the M5 Note does not support the LTE bands in the United States, and doesn't work at all on CDMA carriers like Verizon. On my Project Fi SIM card (only connecting to T-Mobile towers, since I'm using an unsupported device) I often switched between HSPA+ and 3G. Software Previous Next The Meizu M5 Note runs Flyme OS, the company's skinned version of Android 6.0 Marshmallow. While the Note was originally announced to ship with Flyme OS 6 (still unfortunately based on Marshmallow), my review unit shipped with version 5.2.11. As with many Chinese Android ROMs, Flyme OS takes some visual cues from iOS. The notifications panel has a frosted glass background, the launcher doesn't have a separate app drawer, and so on. While I don't mind the overall design, it doesn't share much in common with Material Design. However, Flyme OS seriously cripples this phone. The major problem is that the device ships without Google Mobile Services, which I consider essential to every Android device. GMS not only includes the Google Play Store, but also Google Play Services - essential for most Google applications to even work. This may be acceptable in China, but with the M5 Note being sold internationally, this is a huge problem. Instead of the Play Store, the M5 Note includes the non-descriptive "App Store" and "Hot Apps." The former seems to be a front-end for the sketchy 9APP repository, filled with unauthorized re-uploads from the Play Store and bootleg games. The latter is simply a list of recommended applications, with only an Install button for each item - you can't even view a description. Once you install an application, it vanishes from Hot Apps entirely. Notice how I said the M5 Note "ships" without Google Mobile Services. One of the many sketchy applications visible in 'Hot Apps' is an installer for Google services, which installs everything you need to get the Play Store and your favorite Google apps up and running. If you have ever flashed a gapps package on a custom ROM, this is the same basic concept. However, there is one problem - Meizu is not a GMS partner, which means they are not allowed to distribute Google's library of applications at all. As outlined by David, allowing users to install GMS on uncertified devices could lead to problems down the road. So why does the M5 Note not have GMS installed by default? The most likely answer is that Meizu also ships phones with YunOS (formally known as Aliyun), which is not strictly Android-compatible. The terms for becoming a GMS partner dictate that the given OEM must not ship devices with incompatible forks of Android. So essentially, until Meizu stops selling YunOS devices, they would be blocked from becoming a GMS partner. Flyme OS has some other issues as well. Initially while writing this review, I was unable to change the wallpaper at all - with the error message asking me to "upgrade the system and try again." A recent system update later fixed this problem. Perhaps as not much of a surprise, the M5 Note with GMS also fails SafetyNet, so you won't be playing Pokemon GO on the M5 Note. In addition, during my entire time using this device, I was unable to receive notifications for Hangouts (as well as two other apps). With it being my most-used communication tool, I had to keep my Google Pixel on-hand at all times to ensure I would receive important messages. Battery This is by far the most surprising aspect of this phone, and the primary reason why I cannot recommend the M5 Note to anyone. As explained in the Software section, the M5 Note has not been approved by Google to run Google Mobile Services. Shortly after setting up the device, I used the Google Services installer to obtain the Play Store and related Google services, as I'm sure many other customers will do. Thanks to Flyme OS not being certified for use with GMS, the Google Play Store absolutely tanks battery life on this phone. With a 4,000mAh battery, I was expecting at least a noticeable increase in battery life over my Nexus 5X. What I got instead was the worst battery life I have ever experienced on an Android device. The Play Store regularly consumed 15-25% of my Note's battery in regular use, with Google Play Services always following closely behind. My typical workload on a phone consists of checking various social media applications, some searches and news reading in Chrome, and the occasional Netflix TV episode or short YouTube video. In the time I was able to stand using the M5 Note as my daily driver, I did not see more than three hours of screen-on-time. You might have already scrolled down to leave a comment along the lines of "Corbin, why don't you just uninstall GMS? Then the battery issue would be solved." And while you might be right, I don't consider Android phones without the Play Store or Google Play Services to be usable at all. Searching on F-Droid for long-abandoned alternatives to my favorite applications is not a very enjoyable experience. Conclusion The Meizu M5 Note, put simply, is a bad phone. I wasn't expecting to be blown away, especially at this price point, but the annoyances are not worth the savings. The poor implementation of Google Play Services, the awful battery life, the sketchy included app store, buggy skin, and issues with notifications make the M5 Note unusable as a phone for me - I would take my first-gen Moto G over this any day. While this is clearly designed for the Chinese market, hence the microUSB port and lack of support for US LTE bands, this still has many more problems than other Chinese-aimed smartphones do. Even if you're in a region where the M5 Note is being sold (which isn't North America), you should absolutely not buy this phone. Tags m5 note meizu meizu m5 note subscribe ...

MJ Since like 2016... Justin W Since Type C became the port flagships began using. Because I've already switched over all of my chargers to Type C connectors, this would be firmly in the "con" category - I won't purchase a device without Type C. ReallyMen That's cute. I switched to type C way back in 2015. When I bought my 6P. But that's the only device I have which has type C. Justin W And I also switched over to type c with my 6P. Doesn't change the fact that the next device you or I get will most likely have Type C. Brian USB Type C is quickly becoming mainstream. It's time to ditch Micro USB. Get with the times :P ReallyMen I am with time. A huge gadget freak. I switched over to type C when I purchased my 6P. Corbin Davenport USB Type-C is still rare on Chinese Android devices, outside of flagship devices. It's understandable, much like the lack of LTE bands for America, but still a bit annoying. ReallyMen Here in India, a budget phone which is around 250$ are coming up with type C, fingerprint reader and they put the VoLTE feature in bold letters (because it's a new thing) and sell it. I feel type C hasn't grown much. Even the PC are taking such a long time to get them on board. M. Luciano 2015 Meloku The sad truth is, besides flagship phones in the US/Europe, not many devices use USB Type-C yet. Pointing this as a "con" is just misleading, specially for a sub-$200 Chinese smartphone. Georgi Marinov Since having a 3,5 mm audio jack on your phone is literally making you Hitler. Samarth I don't think anyone even consider buying a Meizu phone in the first place. KzX Since when having headphone jack count as a con? :3 Sruly J When did he say headphone jack is a con? Max Johnson When Apple (not Lenovo) decides you can't have it. MJ Who would even consider a phone meant for the Chinese market anyway? Is it even available in Europe? Corbin Davenport Yes, Meizu officially sells its phones online (including the M5 Note) in China, India, Israel, Europe, Brazil, and New Zealand: https://www.meizu.com/en/wheretobuy.html MJ I don't think a non-GMS Android phone will sell outside of China or India but good try Meizu. LOL Sruly J What about people who purposely don't want Google services? They're in a minority, but they still exist based on what I see on Reddit and XDA. Although it's not worth it for companies to bring their devices to the market just for this minority of users. MJ I can think of better phone options than this one could put a custom ROM on it without GApps. Regardless, my understanding is Meizu is a company actually trying to produce phones that will SELL WELL outside of China. This is NOT the way to go about it especially considering the questionable legality of the device itself. Sruly J So can I. And yeah, the things which Corbin mentioned in the article about what this phone does are just fishy. Bewear Those people are usually tech-savvy users which are more than able to install a custom ROM without flashing GApps. Sruly J I know. Besides, then they can have a great phone. Someone like that buying a phone like this just to not have GApps is laughable. Max Johnson Designing a phone to sell specifically to minorities (I mean in term of numbers, not race, so don't get sensitive) and rom flashers only is a strange marketing plan. Saying you can flash a rom to a phone to make it functional is a really bad excuse, especially when roms have issues which they usually do. Matteo Franco Meizus sold in Europe from the official source have Google services! I made a friend buy a M2 Note like 2 years and she's super happy with that :) MJ My understanding is Meizu is NOT A GSM PARTNER so if they are selling a phone with Google services on it the legality of it is in question. I assume you mean by an official source you are talking about a re-seller. They are known to to slap unofficial ROMs on Meizu phones. It's cool she likes it but personally I don't buy knockoff products. http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/12/15/an-obscure-chinese-smartphone-entering-europe-presents-a-sticky-problem-for-googles-android/ Matteo Franco I didn't read that article in particular before. That's kinda shocking... Those I was talking about are not resellers, but "official stores" that are indicated on their european website. BTW, as they state on their specs list on those "official stores" there's a pretty straightforward line affirming that phones are coming with the Play Store preinstalled (as you can see below)... It doesn't seem really correct then. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/33df4dcf05d88d283871db25ec2e111f54eb83a466914aeea809c339e15048fb.png Thomas Gladdines Indeed there wouldn't be any play services issues if you actually buy it from an official seller instead of some shady reseller that installs outdated gapps, adware and some mystery meat on it. Sruly J So... I'm getting the impression that Corbin isn't a fan of the Meizu M5 Note. Jeaninevbeck Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Alexander Bus I hope Chinese phones get way more popular in the West just so I wouldn't have to read "It's understandable if you haven't heard of this company" in the beginning of every single review about one of them. Sruly J Except that most Chinese OEMs will never reach that accomplishment. Alexander Bus Sure, but there's two or three that stand out. Xiaomi is definitely one of them, Meizu is/was on the verge. M. Luciano I hope that they do not become more popular because they are bringing a lot of very bad Hardware with corrupted software and almost no security to these markets and they price them so cheap that people buy them because they don't know any better. I would much rather that they focus on putting out some quality devices and actually getting them up to par on the software and security front prior to releasing anything in the US. Alexander Bus >very bad Hardware with corrupted software and almost no security You buy cheap shit, you get cheap shit. Don't do that. Get a decent Xiaomi, flash your non-MIUI ROM of choice, and you've got yourself a great phone. Xiaomi Mi5 (not Mi5s) is currently a steal at ~230-250$, it's a sick 2016 flagship. m477 Even Xiaomi's bottom of the line is pretty good. Markoff LeEco phones are better value, saying it as happy owner of two Xiaomi or Zuk 2 is steal as well David Berry Id say it's hard to go wrong with a redmi pro from xiaomi . that's a nice phone for the $ & you get amoled. Meizu are like a samsung 2nd. Id rather buy an older or refurbed samsung & get the real thing. Meizus problem is explained above making it just like umi. At least meizu is going back to samsung & mtk now for their soc AsterMK Alright, I won't get into the bad hardware part because it's simply not true for any of the top Chinese OEMs, and into corrupted software because I'm not sure what that even is, but it's funny how you talk about "almost no security" when Xiaomi has the best track record for updates and security patches from any OEM. M. Luciano Xiamoi is beating Google and Blackberry? I didn't know that. But Xiaomi aside, it's only been about 10 weeks since we were reading about OEMs letting third parties access and modify their low level firmware, which resulted in back doors being created. The excuse was "it is used for customer service" and it impacted at least 2 OEMs. AsterMK Yeah they are. Even on budget devices like my Redmi Note 2 they currently have the January patch level. Those backdoors were found on none of the popular Chinese OEM. Not Xiaomi, or Huawei, or Oppo, or OnePlus, or Lenovo and Motorola. M. Luciano Huawei, ZTE and BLU. AsterMK Do you have a source for that? First time I hear about Huawei having the backdoor. M. Luciano Android Police and others from circa Nov 15th Anon lol none of those are actually verified data. even the source has not been verified by an independent 3rd party. want to know some verified ones? google for CarrierIQ. this californian company implemented backdoors into phones from apple, samsung, HTC, LG, RIM, AT&T, Sprint, Verizon. still think you are safe from these known brands? ha. What is Carrier IQ? Carrier IQ logs information about your whereabouts as well as other personal data such as browsing history, application usage and phone numbers. Carrier IQ users are unaware of the software's existence, as it runs hidden in the background and doesn't require authorized consent to function. From a permissions standpoint -- with respect to Android -- the software is capable of logging user keystrokes, recording telephone calls, storing text messages, tracking location and more. It is often difficult or impossible to disable. M. Luciano Carrier IQ is also stupid. Thankfully every phone I've ever bought has been immune to it. Lloyd Bannings Read that article again. I did a search and found no keyword about Huawei in the main article at all. ZTE and BLU, however, are on the list. Huawei is definitely on the better side in terms of quality and security control than those companies. Link: http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/11/15/security-firm-reportedly-finds-spyware-on-chinese-android-phones-including-blu-devices-sold-in-the-us/ AsterMK I didn't find anything about Huawei on those lists. David Berry I read one that mentioned huawei, zte & others. It was definitely there.i remember thinking what nexus lovers would think? I mean i don't think it makes too much difference if china or sth korea have my info.as if samsung don't sell off our info? It's just the other doors that can potentially be opened leave you vulnerabie on cheaper chinese phones Someone That's true, I own the Redmi note 4 and I got the security patch for 1.1.2017 a week ago! And the phone is perfect without any bugs that I noticed so I'm happy especially because the phone was so cheap 😀 Markoff not sure where are you from but Huawei and Lenovo are HUGE in Europe, followed by Asus and few other brands something like HTC is pretty much unknown since nobody buy it, heck even Sony would be dead if not for subsidizing with contracts Bewear Shitty iOS ripoffs? Nope. rockstarr27 Hmm not sure if I should buy this or not, review was unclear on that. Pedro Diego Fernández He basically told that it's not worth because it's not GMS partner so, you install the google apps with a third party and it may not work well and drain the battery... It's cheap, but maybe you can find some better options with little more money like a Xiaomi and wont have problems with the Gapps Markoff they recommend it since only thing they found can be easily fixed by installing clean custom ROM Corbin Davenport This phone has a Mediatek SoC, so custom ROMs will likely never happen for this. TechGuy22 mediatek you say http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/4c/4cbe603c8a9b399d005eb1a57df4ad371e8fba0f05f2e1e60c1bc8cad9317f8d.jpg CasperTFG Exact same thought every time I read specs on a new device. Giorgio Xenofonte Well, it seems an android review made by an IPHONE fan... :D Miku is Best Vocaloid Explain yourself. Jordan Palmer Not entirely sure how you came to that conclusion. Giorgio Xenofonte It is when you do a review seeing mostly what a thing does not do, instead of what it does... "OMG, where is app store? i dont like it.. it is named google play" "OMG, I cant deal with so many tweaks, roms... I just like it simple" Type-C? Meh... Design? Meizu had "iphone" design before apple Play Store? Camon, it is a chinese phone, there is no play store there... AND you can easily install gapps. This is a LOW PRICE PHONE, by a good brand... so, a good review could see all the good things the device has... not just FLYME IT :D Corbin Davenport My last iPhone was an iPhone 3G. Giorgio Xenofonte Just a metaphor. You approached the cellphone with a heavy load. AsterMK "While this is clearly designed for the Chinese market, hence the microUSB port" How are the two related? Rey Dislike of change. Many including corporations still use XP and IE6. AsterMK I guess, but you're not going to find many Type C phones at that price point in any country, not just China. Besides, China had the first USB C phone in the world. Adam Margeson Correct on the first part, but my Corp finally upgraded to Win7 about 2 years ago. Corbin Davenport As I mentioned in another comment, Type-C on phones/tablets is still rather rare in China, besides on some flagship devices. Jesus Martinez ummm, yeeeaah, USB-C isnt even common here in the US. Sure its going to start being adopted by remind me again why I should care? I have a SGS7E. and that comes with a microusb? you telling me my phone is an absolute piece of ****?? have you not read, some foreign countries/companies are suing google bevause they feel google play services are a monopoly, forcing others from not being able to install their apps. Sure, google apps are badass but if this doesnt even work eith LTE in the US, im guessing they dont really care if they sell like hotcakes here or not. also, arent people always bitching that they want a bare stock experience? sure this is a crappy ios clone ripoff, but at least they have a starting base point for less apps. and as for the camera, if people are willing to sacrifice quality and use a camera phone for everything, surely they dont care about its quality. i care, so i bought a Canon 80D and I have an expensive lens that isnt the crappy lens kit. AsterMK Not really true. China had the first USB C phone to begin with and plenty new mid rangers have it. andrew8806 Software: "There are countless issues with Flyme OS, starting with no Google services being installed by default". Battery life: "The poor implementation of Google Play Services causes the battery life to plummet, even with light use." I am confused with this statement. lol. 2×4 the implementation is poor because it is uncertified and not optimized andrew8806 Yes, but you can't say battery life is bad due to installing an application that the manufacture intended to not be installed on (not certified). If no Google services are installed on it, then installing it manually and giving poor review for battery life just doesn't make sense to me. Thats like me installing facebook on my Moto G and giving the phone a bad review because Facebook eats my battery. 2×4 yes you can because they have a GMS installer app EXPLICITLY to CIRCUMVENT GMS certification while still making GMS apps "available" andrew8806 Well that is an interesting way of implementing. Gotcha. jesuguru Fair enough, but the review correctly implies that an Android phone meant to be sold internationally (where Google services are used, unlike China) should be pre-optimized at least enough to not have battery life decimated after many users predictably install Google services on their Android phone. Renan Maybe when/if TWRP becomes avaliable to this phone, OpenGApps can be flashed? I mean, at least I think that their installation of GMS would work better. Jordan Palmer It's an MTK SoC, so I would not hold my breath. Cesar Cardoso "And while you might be right, I don't consider Android phones without the Play Store or Google Play Services to be usable at all. Searching on F-Droid for long-abandoned alternatives to my favorite applications is not a very enjoyable experience." Corbin, a rhetorical question: what about Amazon Appstore? Thomas Gladdines Sorry to say this: Actually it's a crappy review since an original Meizu phone would never ship with google services. So reviewing it based on something it doesn't have is kinda odd. The reseller probably installed the google services before he shipped the device and used some crappy outdated gapps package and didn't check if any other modifications are necessary for gapps to work properly. And to complete the party the reseller probably added some adware for fun :P The Meizu OS skin is actually pretty nice in my opinion, it's very different from stock indeed but there's great attention to detail and has some interesting additions. And this is a budget Meizu device from around $100 so it's obviously has a Mediatek soc, compared to high end Meizu phones with an Exynos soc. Corbin Davenport The phone was sent as a review unit from Meizu, not a reseller. flipp0 Factory reset the phone and install Google services again. Also, make sure that you have the lastest firmware installed. I have owned several Meizu phones and every one of them had great battery life (with Google play installed). My name is…. Why do you even review non Google devices? I already know AndroidPolice people is gonna shit on it, you guys are a joke. Steve Crap article based off a review unit. Buy it from AliExpress and basically everything you read in this article is crap. Got mine a week ago and it's running flyme 6.0 with google services pre installed - via the seller. Haven't had a single crash or issue in the week I have owned it. Battery life is on par with my 7 plus and get 2 days out of it. Diogo Neves Two friends of mine own the thing and they have nothing but great things to say. Amazing battery life even with the GMS installed and amazing performance for the price. Can't agree with this review. Try another unit before you bash the product for flaws that not everyone has. Steve McQueen SOLD! Rawhi Mohammad Meizu probably didn't pay AP enough this time. Alexis Barrientos 7.0 in January 2017... Not 6.0 Martin Only if they was judging the other OEMs that are releasing phones with problems and lack of updates... ! But of course liking Google's a** pays the bills I guess.. :) Tin My Meizu M1 note is still going strong after nearly 2 years of abuse. The battery still endures 1 day easily. I usually do web browsing 3-4-5 hours a day. Still 40-50% of battery left when I plug to charger at night. LG G3 could not hold charge that long. My wife's redmi note2 as well does not hold charge that long after 6-7 months. They have similar capacity battery of 3000 mAh. Flyme is brilliant if you are used to. I find it easier and quicker to use than usual android 3 buttons in LG and Xaiomi. Gesture wake up is briliant. I do not need to use power button at all. Google play installation is a breeze. I use Google Now as home screen so I do not have all the app icons on the screen. I got bored and bought mi max last month. It is too big and not very practical for daily use. Now I switched back to my M1 note. Dmitry Stepanushkin nice title. lol Vivek Rameses No Google services is a great fucking thing. That should be the selling point. Régis Knechtel "With a 4,000mAh battery, I was expecting at least a noticeable increase in battery life over my Nexus 5X"...."I did not see more than three hours of screen-on-time". Well, I don't know if there's something wrong with my Nexus 5X, but I've NEVER got more than 3 hours of screen-on time. It's usually just 2.5 h :( SE.Quence sot depending on your pattern of use, preferred network (wifi/lte) and so on. Greater improvement I got after reflashing to custom ROM. AQ Have you considered that the google apps you installed from this questionable & unofficial source might be maliciously modified & that is whats draining the battery like mad? Corbin Davenport As mentioned in the article and another comment, the GMS installed is made by Meizu, was found the in the Meizu-developed 'Hot Apps', and was recommended for use to us by a Meizu representative. It's as official as it gets, unfortunately. AQ Oh, I missed the part of "former" in the article, I just read it as both pointing to a sketchy third party. John Liu I think most of your problems are caused by the GMS, including the battery problem SE.Quence Moreover, no Qualcomm SoCs, mostly MTK with weak graphics, always locked bootloader so no any custom ROMs, no FM-radio, no IR remote and so on compared to his rival Xiaomi Redmi 3 Pro based on Snapdragon 650 with stronger performance and battery life. Kostas 💪🎩 It's nice seeing reviews of devices from chinese manufacturers. Considering this author's background with development, it would be nice to also see a personal note at the end of the article, regarding 3rd party development support of the device. Corbin Davenport It should run all Android 6.0-compatible apps. likurges god what I would give to have this skin or at least make my nexus 5 look like this. I don't give a shit if it look like an iphone clone or something, I find it to be one of the prettiest looking skins of android. It's just so clean and slick. Yeah I know the software itself is crap, but they can improve! Corbin Davenport Yeah, the UI itself isn't half bad. Certainly better than some of the other skins I've seen. Rob I wouldn't dare signing in to my main Google account on that phone. Did you (I suppose you did)? Moose Shame that the reviewer had such a bad experience with this phone. I have tried two Meizu phones in recent years - the budget M2 Note and the Pro 5. The former came with a global ROM so had no Chinese apps. Google services were already there. I had no problems with this phone, great battery life although the SOC was a bit laggy and the screen was a fingerprint magnet. However, the Pro 5 was a real flagship. Still I had to install Google services myself and the installed apps were all in Chinese and I got some Chinese notifications occasionally. But it was speedy and had fantastic battery life, plus no problems with anything. One thing I really loved about both these phones was the one-touch on the home button to go back so no need for a separate back button. And you could swipe up from the bottom to show recent apps, very convenient. (Lenovo's Zuk phones work in a similar way). I generally like Meizu phones, my only wish is that they would stop using underwhelming Mediatek processors. Now that they have resolved their differences with Qualcomm maybe we will see some improvement in this area. 1977Rider The problem with notifications happens with my meizu M3 (a.k.a Meizu m3 mini) and M3s, they dont appear until you open the app (whatsapp, as a example). I have the same problems you described (Im brazilian, imported my phones from aliexpress). Pokemon go runs on my M3s (with log in problens) but dont work on M3 mini. The notification problems seems "better" when i uninstalled Gapps, but that F***** my experience with the phones... Argh Flipp0 I have had problems with whatsapp notifications on both Meizu M2 Note and Meizu Max. But I managed to fix both of them. On M2 Note I rooted the phone and uninstalled security manager. On Meizu Max I whitelites whats app in the battery and ram settings and disabled linked launch is settings: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEeMTnFk0Ns Bohari Japar I consider myself a Meizu fan after purchasing MX6 last year. A year before that I got myself Nexus 5x (small upgrade from Nexus 5), all I can say is, Ive never been more impressed. Its really cheap. But, I had to get rooted, extract opengapps and placed all the googliess apk manually because flashing the gapps zip files can be a bit tricky. Right now it feels very good. Markoff so your only complaint is that you don't know how to install custom ROM? because i don't see any provided reason why to not buy this phone in article besides complaining that you are lazy to replace ROM with clean custom ROM like Lineage Flipp0 I don't think custom roms is available for M5 Note but the newest firmware version is available here (both Flyme 5 Stable and Flyme 6 Beta): https://forum.meizufans.eu/category/144/meizu-m5-note Flipp0 Poor review. Countless people use this phone with Google Play and no battery life problems at all. You either got a defective unit or something went wrong with Google Play on your device. Factory reset the phone and install Google Play again. When it comes to missing notfications, I am sure that you can solve this issue by tweaking the power management settings. BIG IMPACT ENT This may sound crazy but..does anybody here have an android phone they need to get rid of?..wouldn't mind sending it to Africa. I am enthusiastic about but phones here aren't that affordable, not especially for people in school. Santiago Boscolo Wow a really good review!! Have you seen the agm a2? Eric "Disclaimer: Since Meizu is not a registered Google Services partner, the international M5 Note comes without Google's services preinstalled. Instead, the phone gives you access to an installer which installs them for you hassle free. Other reviewers have been pointing out that these, essentially sideloaded, Google apps and services drain the battery faster than usual, but we assure you this behavior was only found on the reviewers units, which were sent out running an earlier pre-production version of the ROM. With the latest software build we've been enjoying great battery life." - GSM Arena mf1gt3r This review seems biased. Simtopia23 Android Police = no Google implementations? don't buy it!! I've seen and read most of your reviews, and your reviews are misleading and bashing against chinese phones. Don't pretend every Android user uses the full suite of Google apps because i can tell you, this is not the case even in many countries in EU. RIZA YILMAZ Is this website working under Apple's sponsorship? I am using m5 note and device has no battery or performance issues. This is a cheap middle level phone. What are you waiting for? Alex This put simply, is a bad review. I wasn't expecting to be blown away, but the annoyances are not worth the reading... First of all, you cannot compare the weight of a 5.5" budget phone to a 5.0" flagship device. The Google Picel XL which has thas the same screen size weights only 7 grams less. I own a Meizu phone with Flyme OS and it definitely does not cripple the phone. It actually runs smooth and GMS work completely fine. I could go on.

Google Maps v9.54 prepares to add saved locations for your school and gym, notification channels, and what looks like a task list [APK Teardown] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/05/26 6:22am PDTMay 26, 2017 41 Plus 1 on G+ 69 Share on Facebook 51 Share on Twitter Total Shares161 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Article Contents 1 Teardown 1.1 Saved locations for School and Gym 1.2 The 'Other' Notification Channel 1.3 A few new prompts 1.4 A task list called "Nearby Need?" 2 Download An update to Google Maps v9.54 began rolling out to users through the beta channel yesterday, but it doesn't appear to have any visible changes going live quite yet. However, a teardown of the apk does bring a few hints about what to expect in the future. There are clues about a couple of new saved destinations like the Home and Work slots that have become so useful, the first stirring of support for Android O's notification channels, a few new "promos" to get people interested in various features, and a very curious feature that might turn out to be a task list of sorts. As usual, we've got a link at the bottom to download this update to sideload if you're not interested in waiting for Google to deliver it to your device. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. Saved locations for School and Gym If you find yourself regularly using the Home and Work saved locations for quick navigation, you'll enjoy this one. The Maps team is expanding the list to include two more common destinations: your gym and your school. <string name="GYM_LOCATION">Gym</string> <string name="SCHOOL_LOCATION">School</string> Since those two strings don't really include any specific telltale signs that they're intended to be default saved locations, I've included the two previously existing lines for Home and Work for comparison. It's pretty obvious that the naming convention matches up. <string name="HOME_LOCATION">Home</string> <string name="WORK_LOCATION">Work</string> There is also a newly added icon for education, which I would naturally assume will go with the School destination. There doesn't appear to be a similar icon dedicated to the Gym slot, but it's not as if Google can't easily color-fill the existing fitness icon. Nevertheless, this one missing icon might be a hint that Google won't make these new destination slots available until a future update includes the missing icon. These two new entries will obviously operate just like Home and Work for the purposes of navigation and quick route selection. And as always, users don't have to actually link these slots to real schools or gyms. I'm sure a lot of people will welcome this simple improvement because so many of us travel to more than just work and home in a typical day. The 'Other' Notification Channel I'll just make a quick mention of this topic since it's not really that interesting. Google Maps is going to have a notification channel on Android O titled "Other notifications." <string name="OTHER_NOTIFICATION_CHANNEL">Other notifications</string> I doubt this will be the only custom channel for Maps. After all, there are several subsections in Settings dedicated to each notification type, so we'll probably see the channel list grow a fair amount in the future. I would assume the Maps team is still trying to decide how to best organize the app's notifications. This "other" channel will probably become a placeholder for most of the notifications until they are organized into suitable channels. A few new prompts I normally skip changes that are meant to advertise existing features, but sometimes the focus of banners and notifications can give a little insight into the features and apps that may not be performing as well as expected or simply need user awareness. The latest Maps update includes three new promos. The first banner is for the Google Trips app. Launched around this time last year, Trips is basically an itinerary management app that's also intended for making local recommendations. Trips probably doesn't have a very substantial user base yet, so it's not hard to imagine why Google is trying to breathe a little more life into it. code <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_TITLE">Take your travel info with you</string> <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_TITLE_WITH_AREA_NAME">Take your %1$s travel info with you</string> <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_BODY">Reservations • Things to do • Day plans</string> <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_DOWNLOAD_LINK">Get Google Trips app</string> <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_DISMISS_LINK">No thanks</string> The next addition is intended to get users to try out the recently launched location sharing feature. It's pretty normal to show prompts to get users only newly released features, so there's nothing unusual about this one, but you can probably expect to see it in your navigation setup soon. code <string name="CAR_TI TLE_JOURNEY_SHARING">Share journey</string> <string name="JOURNEY_SHARING_PENDING_PROMPT_TEXT">Share your trip with %1$s</string> <string name="JOURNEY_SHARING_PENDING_PROMPT_TTS">Sharing your real-time location with %1$s until you arrive.</string> <string name="CAR_MENU_START_JOURNEY_SHARING">Share journey</string> <string name="CAR_MENU_STOP_JOURNEY_SHARING">Stop sharing</string> The final promotional banner will belong to the always familiar Local Guides program. As usual, it's going to encourage users to contribute to Maps for points. The one interesting oddity is that these strings have "v2" in their names. It's possible this just means they are for a new set of promos, or this might hint at a revised version of the points program. I would expect the former, but it's at least worth acknowledging the latter is possible. code <string name="POINTS_V2_PROMO_TITLE">Reach new Local Guides levels</string> <string name="POINTS_V2_PROMO_TEXT">Now earn more points for your reviews, photos, edits, and adding new places.</string> <string name="POINTS_V2_PROMO_GOTO_STATS">SEE YOUR LEVEL</string> <string name="POINTS_V2_PROMO_OPEN_HELP">Learn more</string> A task list called "Nearby Need?" There's very little to go on for this topic, but it looks just weird enough that I suspect there's a feature brewing in there somewhere. A pair of new layouts were added with the name "nearby need," one of which defines the look of a list, and the other is for items in that list. There is also a single string with a related name and just the word "navigate" for text. <string name="NEARBY_NEED_NAVIGATE">Navigate</string> /layout/nearby_need_item.xml /layout/nearby_need.xml Based on this very limited amount of information, it does sound a little like a shopping list of sorts. Perhaps less like a grocery list and more like a list of chores or tasks – e.g. getting new tires on the car, picking up some materials for a weekend project, and buying new clothes. I would assume each item goes into a list and Google Maps will make it easy to navigate to the next nearest place where each of these things can be taken care of. I'm not actually sure if these are related, but there are also three new images to be found in the resources, and they certainly would fit with my theory. The first is for creating new tasks, the second is for completed tasks, and the final one is for "old" completed tasks. I suppose the old one might be for things a user did on previous days but hasn't removed from the list. This is all guesswork right now, but many people have been asking for ways to use Maps to get through chores, and this feels like the first hint of something like that. The one aspect that's not yet hinted at, but I certainly hope to see, is a feature that will sort tasks efficiently so people can choose the shortest (or fastest) route to get everything done. I'll keep watching and follow up when there are more developments.

They are used when you go to Your Contributions -> Check the Facts/Uncover Missing info. I think after all this time those two are still only for lvl 5 local guides... so yeah. Cody Toombs Right, the look of the images aren't new, but the files containing those images are. Or said more clearly, there are now multiple copies of those icons. mmark27 I sure would like there to be a "Work" and then a "Parking for Work" section for those that don't park right next to their office. Point being, if I want walking direction/estimations, give them from my office. If I want driving directions/estimations on time, know that I have to walk to my car, then drive from my parking location. The School addition will be good to finally have pop up automatically now though. Cody Toombs If you're not going to use all four slots for their intended purpose, you might just assign one of the others to be your work parking. Frankly, I would have liked these saved slots to have custom labels, since some people don't fit into this one shape. For example, I know somebody that has to travel to two different sites for the same job, and another friend that was enrolled in two different schools at the same time. It's not like one of these destinations can't go into the "Gym" slot, but it would be nice if the titles could make sense. mmark27 Right. I now have my "Work" location saved as my parking lot, which is silly, but it's the only way to get decent estimations. Your fix is what I'll be doing otherwise unless they fix it. The subtly though in this situation is El Goog knowing that the Work and Work Parking are linked existentially, so they can decipher where my body is and estimate from there, etc. Same can be said for Home and Home Parking if not directly on site. Would seem like Google's apartment-city-dwelling-first mentality would be more amenable to this off the bat. I agree that we should be able to have free labels on places and also as many places as we can stomach estimations/notifications on time to. Google knows where I am at all times....make it actually useful, guys. henleyb I work from home and Google would keep asking me to set my work address which is of course the same as my home address, it was a small but annoying thing. :) Cody Toombs I hated that for years. I've been working from home in one capacity or another for more than a decade and it took far too long to see Maps lighten up on having a different Work address. Austin Spangrud Sure would be nice if maps got integrated assistant into it. None of the commands and home commands that I have integrate with the Voice button in maps. Oh and In b4 where's my speed limit pop up Cody Toombs Speed limits are still limited geographically. Since I was in the Bay Area last week, I finally saw them pop up for the first time on my phone and in Android Auto. Funny enough, I now have a Speed Limit toggle in settings on one phone, but nowhere else :/ And now I'm probably not going to see the speed limits again for a long time. Paul_Werner Yeah and we used to have them and they disappeared. At least it did for me here in the Milwaukee, WI area. Same for when I travel to Chicago Nicholas Matranga Finally, it was so annoying to have to save my school address as my work address just to get commute updates. mike shwilly Grow up Maxr1998 Had to do the same, I'm very glad they implement this option now that I will have finished school in less then a month... (And haven't visited it for anything except a few exam-days since late April..) Hamilton Jimenez Vasquez Finally, Im glad that we can save more pinned-saved choices other than the usual Home and Work, although I would prefer to customize them on my own in the same manner we customize the saved list. I could make a really good use of few in my mind like Church, Work2, University, etc. Jon Xuereb Couldn't you use this school one for University Hamilton Jimenez Vasquez I used the word University just an example, the point is that it would be great to customize those pinned saves using our own creations. Taylor Hardy I work from comfort and ease of my property or home, through doing easy gigs that only takes from you a Computer and web connection and I am also joyful than before... After six months time in this project and also i got made in sum 36,000 usd... Basically I make near 80 bucks/hr and work for three to four hours every day.And excellent point relating to this work is that you can easily handle time and effort while you work and for how long as you prefer and you generate a paycheck per week........ learn by clicking here how to do it right now Paul_Werner I can't wait to see that "nearby need" implemented. Your guesswork on it sounds like it could be a really useful feature. h4rr4r Why are these static names? Why can't I add random strings and assign them saved locations? Ken Vincent what ever happened to speed limits? I thought that was on the verge of being a thing more then a year ago. UKTK8 "In the coming weeks" Meaning whenever Google d#$% well pleases. Jon Xuereb Lawyers I'm assuming dmo580 Yet Waze and other GPS apps have no issues. How about just displaying my current speed? Ken Vincent Not only that, but google provides speed limits as a service. I would imagine that is where Waze gets their speed limit info. https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/roads/speed-limits Jon Xuereb Because Google Maps is exponentially larger in terms of user base, and google is a bigger target for lawsuits Ken Vincent Waze is wholly owned by Google. They are not even an Alphabet company, they are Google. Jon Xuereb Still the size of the userbase affects the their risk assessment icyhotmike why not just let us add "Saved" locations such as Home and Work and whatever else we want? Damn Google in control of everything. makapav My God the Google apps and ecosystem are becoming such a clusterfuck with no sources of truth for data points. All the information is spread across random places. Richard Oldroyd I do use home a lot but for the others like gym I save as a contact and nav just as quick. Richard Oldroyd I'd love maps to display my current speed and advise what the speed limit is. Obviously they would have to add a warning saying they can not be held responsible for displaying an incorrect speed limit. I'd also like to see us be able to choose what is displayed underneath where they show destination time and miles to go, it would be useful to see arrival times at all stops not just the one you are currently naving to. Sathiya Moorthy Karan Really usefull information Regards, Sathiya Moorthy K developeit.net Jason List/Task ?? Why does Google keep messing with reminders/task ? Just create a dedicated reminders/task app already and move on. I hate that my reminders are spread out all over the place. Inbox, Calendar, Assistant, Keep. Get it together Google.

Generate Enquiries for your Business by Listing on Economictimes.com List Your Business Find Service Near You By Sreeraman Thiagarajan Looks like Google I/O, their annual developer conference is now likely to stay at their backyard at Shoreline Amphitheatre as opposed to Moscone center in San Francisco where eight of their previous conferences were held. Shoreline Amphitheatre is an open-air venue in the pacific coast of California with abundant sun shine, and Google's CEO Sundar Pichai opened the keynote by urging the 7000 plus members present to apply the sunscreen liberally and declared ''it's on us". The #io17 keynote was two-part series and long enough that we had a lunch break in between; there was a whole bunch of announcements made to please two types of people who matter to Google the most - Developers and Consumers. Gone are the tactics of skydiving glass wearers and giving away of a bounty of laptops and smartphones to attendees. After 18 years since inception, Google has now sobered up and it is a bit boring when I realized they are losing their child like enthusiasm. Nevertheless, they have aged well, and this year's IO clearly focused on driving home one message 'Mobile first world to AI first world'. Here is how they did it. Bragging and show of strength: While Android has crossed two billion users, six other Google products enjoy a billion plus users every month, they are Search, Gmail, Chrome, YouTube, Maps, and Play Store. Pichai and his clique proudly demonstrated how machine learning and AI are being integrated into their products for transitioning from a mobile first world to a AI first world. Gmail gets Smart Replies, something that is borrowed from their messaging app Allo. Upcoming Android O gets Smart Text selection which automatically differentiates between a phone number and a postal address when you select a text, Android phones are now fortified with Google Play Protect, which uses machine learning to scan one billion devices and 50 billion apps each day to protect its users from malware and it even helps in finding lost phones. Pichai also emphasized how voice and image has become an important mode of computing and even showed off a chart that claims their algorithm has lower error rate than humans in terms of image recognition. This was quickly followed by announcement of Google Lens for Assistant, which essentially uses smartphone camera as an input device and reduces the need to search through typing text or giving voice commands. Each of the above is made possible by deploying Machine learning and AI at scale through their advanced TPU deployed on Google cloud. TPU or tensor processing units are much faster and powerful than normal CPU and GPU. By deploying them on cloud and making it accessible for everyone, Google thinks every developer can build next generation products. Collectively they call this as 'Google.ai' which is an ensemble of tools, efforts and research that aims to bring the benefits of AI to everyone. Some of the applied AI areas from Google.AI transcend way beyond just making Google products smarter. From DNA sequencing to helping pathologist diagnose cancer better, Google.AI is on a poignant journey to make the world a better place. With such profound application of technology, the atmosphere around the keynote hit a crescendo of drama but Sundar swiftly brought the geeky mood back by showing a light-hearted application called AutoDraw which uses applied AI to convert our scribbles of a cat into an actual cat drawing. Digital inclusion: Not to be confused with reaching and including people at grassroots level, here we are talking about Google being inclusive of first world citizens and Apple fans. The most compelling use case of AI to make an average users' life better is through Google Assistant. The chatty, natural language assistant that aims to help us in real world was launched during io16 for Google Home and subsequently introduced for Pixel phones, it is now available for iPhone. On both Android and iPhone, Google Assistant will now work in French, German, Brazilian Portuguese and Japanese. And coming soon are Italian, Spanish and Korean But that's not all. Google just opened the Assistant SDK for developers and OEM of any apps and electronic appliances to be Google Assistant compatible. They have already worked with leading consumer appliances brand including LG, Bang & Olufsen, Sony among others and these products are hitting the shelf soon. With this, you can ask your smartphone to turn the AC on or play music in home audio system. Besides Assistant coming to iPhone, Daydream VR is coming to headsets from partners including HTC and Lenovo which will not require a smartphone or PC to power the user's VR experience. Users just put the headsets on and it works. They work on a principle Google calls as 'WorldSense' which is powered by technology from its Tango AR system. Attracting the next billion users: India alone added over 100 million people online last year - this is the highest growth among any country in the world. Google tried to woo Indians with Android One, a bunch of low cost devices launched during 2015, but they did not do very well. Google is now taking off from exactly where they left off from Android One, this time with a strategy that stems from software, an OS called Android Go, and not through price controls through affordable or cheap hardware /smartphones. Google announced Android Go at this IO, a modified OS spinoff from its latest Android O. Android Go is poised to work on cheap smartphones with less than 512MB of RAM and comprises a rebuilt set of Google apps such as YouTube Go, a new leaner version of Google Play Store and more. It is interesting and amusing to see how Google promotes both web and apps, two opposing tech philosophies in same measure. While Android GO helps in delivering leaner apps, Progressive Web Apps and Accelerated Mobile Page (PWA & AMP respectively) helps have better web experiences even in 2G connections and slower devices. While io16 saw Flipkart lite demo their PWA site that even works offline, this year we saw representatives of Ola on stage who booked a cab using PWA which uses just 0.5MB of data on a web browser and requires no app download, as opposed to a 100MB of space Ola app occupies on IOS or 60MB on Android. Pichai also briefly mentioned about how Google Translate is now using neural machine translation technology to translate between English and nine widely used Indian languages in a more accurate way. Beside the keynote, there were dedicated sessions and talks to win in India where internet based products cannot expect continuous internet connectivity! Strengthening their ad business: By knowing their consumers well. Nearly 90% of Google's revenue till date comes from advertising revenues. They are the world's leading media company and in second slot comes Facebook. Facebook has its social graph which plainly knows what places, brands, events and people their consumers 'likes' and who are they related to and how they feel about a given topic. Armed with this information they can show more relevant ads that delivers better ROI for their paying customers. Google lacks such a social graph until now. Microsoft acquired LinkedIn and the benefits of knowing how people are connected and behave in a professional context will lead in huge accrual of insights for a company creating and selling productivity products. Understanding connections and relations between people is where Google has a chink in the armor and they are fixing it in an amazing way with Google Photos and Home - both products work in a way that connects individual users to their friends and family. Let Google learn about 'us' than just know about me basis what I searched or browsed. Google photos has over 500 million users who upload billion of pictures every day and this IO they launched a feature called 'Suggested Sharing' which nudges a user to share pictures with friends or family who is in the picture captured by the user. Another feature announced is the 'Shared Libraries' which can automatically send and receive relevant photos between two contacts. Now imagine the possibilities of creating a contextual understanding of each of its user as a connection to another user. There it is, Google photo is Google's own social graph; and they are taking this so seriously that have launched a physical photo book printing service called 'Photo Books' in US. It starts at $9.99 and all the IO attendees get a photo book for free. Sure, why not start with the developer community to test the new social graph. Though Google does not talk about its enterprise and business solutions such as AdWords or Analytics in IO, it does a follow up event called Marketing Next where new updates and products features that matter to advertiser are announced. Everything else: We saw was not new bets like Allo or Duo that took on competition like last year, but a bunch of innovations that would keep Google on top the game they are already good at. YouTube supports 360-degree video on connected TVs, content creators and artistes get additional means to generate revenue through Super Chat, a feature where fans can pay for their comment to be pinned and highlighted during a live performance on YouTube. The developer community in the amphitheater cheered with an intensity that would shame soccer hooligans when Kotlin, a new age programming language, was declared as officially supported for Android! With Daydream, Google is pushing the boundaries of VR. Not only are the taking smartphone out of the VR headsets but are also making it more useful than just entertainment and games. A new navigational concept called VPS or Virtual Positioning Service was announced, it is an advanced VR based navigation that accurately works in indoor spaces. In the demo video, we saw how VPS can help you find a right tool at the aisle in a massive shopping store. As a conclusion when Pichai came back to stage, he announced the biggest incremental feature that Google Search has ever got - Google for Jobs. A Google's take on simplifying job search for both blue and white collars across skills and experience. They are doing this in collaboration with LinkedIn, Facebook, Monster among others and of course it uses Machine learning to make the job hunt easy for users. Google has realized the shift from mobile to AI, it is not only reimagining each of its product to stay ahead of the curve but is also urging developers to join the journey. The restraint displayed in not launching any more me too products as challengers unlike previous years says volumes about a matured leadership. Every new feature or innovation they are working on ultimately leading to better advertising solution and thus increased revenue is a masterclass in business strategy; something that many new age, cash-burning startups can learn from. After all, greatest innovation happens through collaborations and we see them in plenty at a developer conference aptly names IO which stands for 'innovation in the open'.

PHOTO: AFP A total of 34 artificial intelligence startups were acquired in the first quarter of this year, more than twice the amount of activity in the year-ago quarter, according to the research firm CB Insights. Tech giants seeking to reinforce their leads in artificial intelligence or make up for lost ground have been the most aggressive buyers. Alphabet Inc’s Google has acquired 11 AI startups since 2012, the most of any firm, followed by Apple Inc, Facebook Inc and Intel Corp, respectively, according to CB Insights. The companies declined to comment on their acquisition strategies. A spokesman for Apple did confirm the company’s recent purchase of Lattice Data, a startup that specializes in working with unstructured data. The first quarter also saw one of the largest deals to date as Ford Motor Co invested $1 billion in Argo AI, founded by former executives on self-driving teams at Google and Uber Technologies Inc. The next revolution: artificial intelligence Startups are looking to go deep on applications of artificial intelligence to specific fields, such as health and retail, industry observers say, rather than compete directly with established companies. “What you will see is very big players will build platform services, and startup communities will migrate more to applied intelligent apps,” said Matt McIlwain, managing director of Madrona Venture Group. Healthcare startup Forward, for example, is using artificial intelligence to crunch data that can inform doctors’ recommendations. “For people who really want to focus on core AI problems, it makes a lot of sense to be in bigger companies,” said Forward Chief Executive Officer Adrian Aoun, who previously worked at Google. “But for folks who really want to prove a new field, a new area, it makes more sense to be separate.” Artificial intelligence companies that do remain independent field a steady stream of suitors: Matthew Zeiler, chief executive of Clarifai, which specializes in image and video recognition, said he has been approached about a dozen times by prospective acquirers since starting the company in late 2013. Toyota to use Nvidia’s AI technology for self-driving cars Clarifai’s pitch to customers such as consumer goods company Unilever Plc and hotel search firm Trivago is bolstered by its narrow focus on artificial intelligence. “(Google) literally competes with almost every company on the planet,” Zeiler said. “Are you going to trust them with being your partner for AI?” Tech giants have been locked in a bidding war for academics specializing in artificial intelligence. Startups rarely have the capital to compete, but a company with a specialized mission can win over recruits, said Vic Gundotra, chief executive of AliveCor, which makes an AI-driven portable heart monitor. “They say, ‘I want to come here and work on a project that might save my mother’s life,’” Gundotra said.

PhoneDog Android And Me TodaysiPhone NEW Call T-Mobile at (855) 668-8976 TmoNews Unofficial T-Mobile Blog, News, Videos, Articles and more Navigation Home Submit News 700MHz LTE map Upcoming Phones HOT TOPICS: Samsung Galaxy Note 7 LG V20 Google Pixel Extended Range LTE Android 7.0 Nougat You are here: Home > T-Mobile offers to pay for Verizon switchers’ phones, two-lines-for-one deal also coming T-Mobile offers to pay for Verizon switchers’ phones, two-lines-for-one deal also coming May 24, 2017 Alex Wagner 108 Comments Yesterday T-Mobile CEO John Legere teased that T-Mo had multiple announcements coming up, and today a couple of them have been made. Starting May 31st, T-Mobile will kick off its #GetOutoftheRed promotion to help Verizon customers switch to T-Mo. Verizon customers in good standing with their carrier can get their iPhone or Google Pixel paid off by T-Mobile when they switch to T-Mobile and sign up for T-Mobile One, and they can keep their existing device. The phones that qualify for this promotion include the iPhone SE, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, Google Pixel, and Google Pixel XL. T-Mobile says that these devices were selected because “phones need certain software to be globally compatible, and some phones don’t yet have that software.” Magenta does say that it’s working with unspecified device makers to make more phones compatible with this promotion. Additionally, Verizon customers switching to T-Mobile must add T-Mo’s Premium Device Protection Plus insurance plan to their device to qualify. This insurance plan costs $15 per month and includes protection against loss, theft, and accidental damage, McAfee ID Protection, McAfee Content Protection, and other features. T-Mobile says that it’ll pay Verizon customers that take advantage of this promotion with a digital prepaid MasterCard card that typically arrives within 15 days. While this #GetOutoftheRed promotion is focused on Verizon customers (because VZW phones are unlocked), T-Mobile is doing something for AT&T and Sprint subscribers, too. Starting on May 31st, AT&T and Sprint customers can switch to T-Mobile and get their existing device paid off when they buy a new phone from T-Mobile on EIP. And unlike Carrier Freedom, those customers won’t be forced to trade in their existing device. Finally, T-Mobile says that starting tomorrow, May 25th, T-Mobile One customers with at least two voice lines can get two additional lines of service for the price of one. The cost of the second line will be offset by a bill credit. Our friends over at Wirefly have a great tool to compare T-Mobile plans against each other and against other plans on the market.

(J²) Right… I’d found that the system doesn’t consistently apply these. TylerCameron Yeah their billng process it’s horrible Steve_NYC So true. I actually considered moving to the T-Mobile One Plan even though it would have cost me more money, just to get away from the insanity of their bill credit process. I finally got things straightened out, but I am sure it will be a problem in the future. It’s gotten to the point that I think it’s deliberate. Mike I had a free line from November that I had to call in every month. to get credit. They finally fixed it to be automatic this month. best part I got extra bill credits for months since last November and my bill is now negative so I didn’t have to make a payment this month. Al William So in order to get the free line, you need to have at least a total of 4 voice lines? Corey Jalette You need to have 2 voice lines to get this promo, which you get 2 lines for the price of 1. So in total you end up woth 4 lines, 1st 2 have to be voice, the 2 you’re adding could be whatever you want. So if you’re on the 2/100 plan right now if you add 2 tablets it would be 120 a month (20 per tablet but 1 is free) or if you add 2 voice lines it would be 140 (40 for adding a 3rd line then 4th is free) Al William Thanks for the clarification! So minimum 2 voice lines and the other 2 could be voice or data. I just wish they get rid of these bill credits. Sometimes it’s such a nightmare. Corey Jalette It can be yes but that’s how pretty much everything is done. Just like they had a free line deal in march it’s listed on my account as a free line on us but I still get the charge on my bill, but it’s auto credited. The only time it wasn’t was the first month because I added it before the end of the billing cycle. Cost $49 but they also credited my account manually that one time. Haven’t had an issue since. AWasserberg7 This article mentions Magenta. What *is* Magenta? Is that some cute term of affection for T-Mobile? kev2684 Are you serious? It’s their brand color. VZW = Red AT&T = Blue T-Mobile = Magenta Sprint = Yellow Nobody Special Cricket (umm, green) lol Genecio MetroPCS= Purple Black&Orange= Boost The Waz Just confirmed by T-Force that if you have a 2 for 100 plus a “this ones on us promo” giving you total 3 lines, you will lose your free line if you take advantage of the promotion of 2 for 1 tomorrow. They stated that they have to move you to a different Tmobile One plan….makes no sense since there is only 1 plan…… Corey Jalette This is ONLY if you’re adding a voice line people. If you’re adding tablet/smartwatch/mobile Internet plans that doesn’t affect your phone plan promo of 2/100. Corey Jalette Add 2 tablets with unlimited data on your plan for $20/month. They frequently have a free tablet promo with qualifying data plan. Snatch those up and you’re golden. The Waz Yes this will affect both. IF you have the 2 for 100 and the “this one is on us” free line….you will lose both promotions…confirmed with t force and John directly. Ben Also why can’t the t force reps do this. Seems very simple. chnage to the 4 plan rate, open the C-2 documentation, search this one on us, ask supervisor to open the page, enter the code on my account to reflect the 4th line as being free. And then add the 1 for 2 lines, or 50 percent off a one more line. This way I keep hookup and this one on us promo. and also eligible for future lines down the road. Yea this is very strange Corey Jalette Not the case, I was able to add 1 more tablet line to my plan for half off yesterday. 2/100 all in promo with 1 free tablet line from March. Now 1 more tablet at half off. 4/$110 not including any kickbacks which both phone lines usually stay under 2gb so 4/$90 now. Had to pay the sim/activation charge of $25 +tax, and my first month will cost about $40 for adding midway through billing cycle. Then $10 or less(if kickback is on). Ben Also why can’t the t force reps do this. Seems very simple. chnage to the 4 plan rate, open the C-2 documentation, search this one on us, ask supervisor to open the page, enter the code on my account to reflect the 4th line as being free. And then add the 1 for 2 lines, or 50 percent off a one more line. This way I keep hookup and this one on us promo. and also eligible for future lines down the road. So yea im wondering is anyone can find a loophole or something Andrew Singleton the reason is that you’re on a 2-line promotional plan paying $20 less than everyone else, and you’ve added a line. since you’re unable to add another line on that plan, you are forced to switch to a 3+ line plan, and that will cause activation-related discounts to drop. Corey below is correct, because internet lines (tablet, watch, syncup drive) are their own rate plan and don’t affect your voice configuration. Ben Also why can’t the t force reps do this. Seems very simple. chnage to the 4 plan rate, open the C-2 documentation, search this one on us, ask supervisor to open the page, enter the code on my account to reflect the 4th line as being free. And then add the 1 for 2 lines, or 50 percent off a one more line. This way I keep hookup and this one on us promo. and also eligible for future lines down the road. J Gerard Yeah! Let’s switch to T-MOBILE because we want to not be able to make phone calls half the time, and not have a signal to look something up when we actually need it. Oh yeah, and to not be able to upload pictures of something fun that we’re doing until we’re at home connected to WiFi later that night or the next day. Before any of you “magenta” fans TRIES to defend them… I’ve been a Verizon customer for about 12 years except for 6 months last year, when I switched because of crappy TMobile’s cheap prices and convincing (misleading) advertising. It was HORRIBLE. I used to get pissed and call them to ask why I could never get a signal. After 6 months, I finally admitted to myself that it was a ridiculous mistake and switched back to The Red! NEVER any issues with Verizon’s service. Never. “Magenta” is only good at talking a big game. If anyone’s thinking about switching to T-Mobile, DON’T DO IT. They are the worst. Go to any other carrier. Doesn’t have to be Verizon. kev2684 It’s all about location, location, location. Just because your area is bad, doesn’t mean everybody will have the same problem as you. J Gerard … EXCEPT that I live in a city. Oh, and Verizon’s coverage is flawless here. I happen to also know (through friends) that AT&T and Sprint are good here, too. Oh, but it’s all about location, location, location. Weak argument. T-Mobile just sucks! There’s a reason it’s so CHEAP! Austin8480 … OK JGerard. Next time, PLEASE use all capital letters to truly get YOUR point across. What I find PATHETIC is that you are a die hard Verizon turd in a TMobile blog. Oh wait, I meant Verizon TURD. Forgot to emphasize that. NOBODY in this room gives a flying —- about your opinion because you slummed it for 6 months and went to Magenta and it was as big of a mistake as…well, I will let you figure it out. J Gerard You were so busy typing a 3rd grade level post that you forgot to make a point. Here’s one for you: T-Mobile is inferior to almost all other carriers. Austin8480 If T-Mobile is so inferior, why are you even giving this blog the time of day. Are you upset that no kids want to hop in your van and eat your chocolate, so you are going to take out your frustrations on the inferior wireless network? thepanttherlady *Tip* Starbursts don’t melt :D theseanteam The hate is strong in this one. Those six months must have really scarred you or something. When you say almost all other carriers, which ones are you referring to? There are only four major carriers after all. And actually, that argument about location is a pretty strong one. T-Mobile’s network is the fastest in many locations, but can be really poor (or even non-existent) in others. The same can be said about everyone–including Verizon. Every carrier has their strong and weak areas. For someone to deny such would have to either be 1) ignorant 2) biased beyond belief or 3) troll. yankeesusa Yea, it still amazes me that people complain about coverage and then lump everyone else in america as having the same coverage, like we all live in the same area. Oh well. People never learn. I’m just happy tmobile works for me and that my data speeds are the highest iv’e ever had. At my house i’m getting close to 100megs almost every time. But hey i guess that’s not good enough for some. thepanttherlady I moved to Crestline a couple of weeks ago. No service. :'( kev2684 I had to google where that is lol :D Yeah it’s rural Ohio but I suppose Band 12 is coming? I’ve seen sightings on Band 12 in Jacksonville, FL lately as well as other parts of the country it’s currently not available. They’re probably working on it at the moment. thepanttherlady Sorry, I should have been more specific. It’s Crestline, CA. I made the same mistake when I called a county office but only Googled Crestline. Guy was really confused as they don’t have my address there. Took me a minute to figure out he was in Ohio. LOL kev2684 You’re literally live in a mountain! Views must be spectacular! thepanttherlady Some of them really are. :) Zacamandapio Verizon here we gooooooo. By the way, we went to Lake Gregory. :) thepanttherlady I’m literally 7 minutes from there. Went there 2 weekends ago to check it out. Water level is a little on the low side. Met a couple that same night that said they’d drained it for some reason and cited “water politics” because I guess the locals aren’t happy about it. Drove up from the Hesperia side this past Saturday and got to see Lake Silverwood. Will have to check it out this summer. Nice drive but hated seeing so many dead trees. :( ETA: I had to get Frontier (Verizon) internet so I could actually use my cell phone. What really sucks is: 1. I literally just got a hotspot through T-Mobile a month ago when they were offering another free line. It’s unusable. 2. I now HAVE to buy phones that have WiFi calling. Blah! thepanttherlady From the day we moved in 5/7: http://imgur.com/UQHsBZF http://imgur.com/t9Z64Q3 http://imgur.com/tm7ReiU And the lake :) http://imgur.com/1YUxwV9 http://imgur.com/tnGMcoq http://imgur.com/zhY16YK http://imgur.com/eaXr58H http://imgur.com/JO9BHJW Sharti24 Who will you be switching to? thepanttherlady I’m not switching. Yet anyway. I lose service 1/2 way up (or down) the mountain so I’ll probably have to get a very cheap pre-paid service/phone for emergencies in case I break down. Not all turnouts have a call box. I still work in Orange County and T-Mobile works fine most places I go. If it starts to be a problem then I’ll have to consider my options. Sharti24 Have tmobile send you a range extender. Not the one you plug into the internet but the one that has two boxes that boosts signal Berzerker Yeah, if you live in Bumblefuck, Montana, don’t switch. Greg Piller Shoot, I just signed up in Montana for TMO. Guess I’m “bumblefucked” lol. I have traveled to every state and been in EVERY U.S. major city multiple times living in every timezone and 11 states. My goodness you have a warped idea of “crap state”. Montana is paradise partner. You have to be from either NYC or California with that f’ed up mentality. He is right & not just in “crap” places but a lot of places like Chicago, IL where I was born and raised. Verizon & AT&T ARE better, Considerably better now in most places but TMO is gaining on them quickly & may reach parity in a few years. When THAT happens if TMO is still competitive, one would have to be a lunatic to stay with AT&T or Verizon. Berzerker …lol. I never said Montana was a “crap state.” It’s the easiest thing to think of when you think of wilderness where you won’t have service for miles. I could have picked a bunch of states, but Montana has, IIRC, the smallest habitation of humans to state ratio, behind Alaska of course. Easy target. Greg Piller To me 4 lines for $120 with TMO is enough of a savings to ditch AT&T. Verizon & AT&T and some of their customers can be arrogant & I think John Legere is one helluva CEO. I can pick up a burner sim with AT&T’s Cricket when I travel a bit and use it until TMO improves in Montana & then it’s sianara to ATT. Happy to be back with TMO. I was formerly a customer since the Voicestream days but when I moved west couldn’t keep them. Their coverage improvement in Montana & the nation as a whole with him at the helm has been nothing short of INCREDIBLE. I hope if the Sprint deal happens Legere is retained as CEO. mreveryphone Hummm… I travel the country for my job and I rarely have issues with T-Mobile… Is it perfect?? No… But no carrier is.. Verizon worked out for you, that’s great. T-Mobile works for millions, that’s also great. But this butt hurt rant is ridiculous and pure comedy! J Gerard “butt hurt rant” is kind of a dumb way to describe what I’m saying. But, I’ll consider the source, eh? Do you know ANYONE who thinks that T is better than V? Nope. So, the difference between us is that I choose to have a better service and I’m willing to pay a little more for it. You are cheap, and you’re willing to have an inferior service because it’s cheaper. That’s it. You know Verizon is better than T-Mobile Francisco Peña Anyone switching carriers should NEVER just switch without taking advantage of the initial return period. I was with VZW for yrs myself. Loved it, with my UDP that was grandfathered. Even went through one wave of price hikes to stay. Then the wife wanted a non-feature phone, and the price hike for her would have boosted out then $108 monthly payment, to $160 once we got a basic data plan, her line access fee (joke) and a new phone. So I looked into TMo. I purposely bought a phone the yr before that worked with Tmo and VZW (moto X DE) and signed up for one line of TMo, switched my Moto to Tmo and reactivated an older LTE phone I had back on VZW. Then I went around for a week doing speed tests everywhere I went. Stuck in traffic? speed test. Both side by side on the seat. Mall? yup, side by side in my hands. Work? yup. Home? yup. I hated VZW at work because my Moto could never get a signal inside the building, which caused my battery to die quickly each day. TMo? got a strong signal. Home, both were weak, but about the same. Driveway? same. So after 10 days, I went in to TMo and switched. Got 2 new phones (had a deal on G4s then) and was spending $140 for 2 lines/10GB each (was the $100/2L/10GB deal) with those phones. Has it been perfect? no. Has it been enough to switch back? no. After some finagling, got a $70 plan with 6GB each for 2 lines. Then have gotten a free line on top of that.. so now I pay $130 for 3 lines, with 6GB each (two don’t come close, mine has Stash so I’m good) and 2 new G6 phones. So for the price, its awesome. Can I deal with some poor service on the outskirts of town? sure. Oh, that Moto X? got it on the 3rd line… theseanteam I don’t think anyone has ever claimed that T-Mobile has better coverage than Verizon, but the point is it has the same quality of coverage in many places. Where I live, T-Mobile has equal coverage and faster speeds. It might not be like that for you, as everyone’s experience will vary. I’m sure if others suffered with bad service, they would switch carriers as well. But your superiority complex is just silly. mreveryphone I know plenty of people that think T-Mobile is better than VW… And I know people that think the opposite, it depends where you live. The service was inferior for you but not for me by any means… I appreciate the cheap name calling, I’ll be cheap all day if it means saving money but getting better service FOR ME… I’ve had service in buildings where others on VW had 0, I’ve smoked people on VW in data speeds tests so I’ll be cheap all day long!! Lol Vazaha There’s an unwritten agreement when you join T-Mobile that you will refrain from living in or going to crappy places. If you live in a decent place T-Mobile is fine. If T-Mobile sucks in your area, you know why :). Vazaha But seriously, I’m always envious of ATT and V when I go to crap places. tranceformer978 Why are you going to crap places? Melissa Cardenas Well what the hell are you doing on this website then? This is a T-Mobile forum obviously most people on here have T-Mobile and they Happy with it so they ain’t gonna listen to you . T-Mobile did not work in my old house so i had Verizon. Now in my new house Verizon don’t work at all and i had to get T-Mobile again because T-Mobile works here fine , So no carrier is perfect. It all depends on location!! J Gerard I get tech news alerts on my phone and things like this come up sometimes and I click on them. I believe that’s allowed! Apparently, what’s not allowed here is proper grammar and punctuation. I almost had to have your post translated in order to read it, but I figured it out eventually. Where did you go to school? Melissa Cardenas What ever im in a hurry and didn’t have time to spell check .But seriously don’t change the subject i don’t get why people like you come talk trash on a T-Mobile forum. ?? Makes no sense haha . And what ever im PRETTY sure you understood fine what i wrote in my first comment. Bull that you almost had to get it translated. Omar Boyer Melisa hes just being an idiot haha i understood perfectly well your first post. And i see they gave u some thumbs up on that first post so others also understood you no need to translate it . Ignore this lowlife with nothing to do. If he wants to stop making an Azz out of himself he should just block the notifications he gets from here. Melissa Cardenas i have better things to worry about ;) omar. And like you said he should just turn off notifications from here then. Eric Harlow Don’t give J Gerard the satisfaction in getting a reaction out of you and allow him to control the situation don’t dumb down to his level Eric Harlow Get off Melissa Cardenas butt about grammar here. This is a forum! Not a college message board or an college English Composition course. T-mobile has improved drastically within the last 3 years. T-mobile works for me out here in San Diego and in my future home in Missoula, Montana. I have mental disabilities that I got serving in The US Navy for twenty years and I dislike your comments towards Melissa Cardenas. This is a T-mobile fan website to discuss peacefully about T-mobile, so get your BIG RED DUMB AND DUMBER ASS OUT OF HERE. Andrew Addison You just made my night with that bomb diggity comment towards that boozo the snow clown filled with stuffy nose, trying to come off as English weirdo professor correcting people on their grammar fool there Bro. Is this guy here serious right now? He had no reason to talk down to someone like that and also talk down on the finest company/carrier, advising everyone to stay away from the best carrier/company which that one being T-Mobile-MetroPCS. We will forever be way Better in USA than any other carrier would have been. Eric Harlow OOH REALLY!!! HOW AWESOME!! Glad I made your night! RLB63 I actually feel sorry for you. How miserable your life must be for you to spend so much time on a site of a company you seem to hate so much. Cellphone companies aren’t making political statements. Seem way to smart for that. Don’t attack social issues. Attacking T-Mobile worth while to you and to spend so much time. You must not have anything better to do with your life. Eric Harlow I think you were supposed to reply back to J Gerard not me. I have been a T-mobile customer for over ten years and I am happy to be a T-mobile customer. Haze1nut English is a 3rd language for me, behind French and Portuguese. Correct my grammar for me, will you. It obviously makes you feel superior. Ascertion You think everyone that switches to T-Mobile can’t “Make calls half of the time”? You’re out of your mind! Tony Chen agreed, t mobile has gained millions of customers each quarter. if the drop calls were so bad why would t mobile gain 100% of new customers agaIN? another blockbuster quarter by t mobile. moonoverparma Funny, I’ve never had a problem. Nobody Special Several years ago i had a verizon phone (when the iphone’s came out they were the only one that were selling them with unlimited data at that time) and i had T-Mobile flip phone that i was using to make international calls. I have to admit, Verizon was more reliable than T-Mobile during my cell phone usage. I chose T-mobile over Verizon because of many reasons…. but it was never due to their coverage, because their coverage was horrible… but since then their coverage has improved. But i switched primarily due to the inexpensive international calls. That was a deal breaker for me, i was content with the terrible coverage with anticipation that they would improve their service. and with Verizon i was paying around $89 dollars for unlimited data and text and 450 minutes of voice calls. my tmobile line (from what i can remember) was around $78 dollars for unlimited talk and text and data. But fastforward to today, I have 5 Unlimited Everything (data/text/voice) lines with unlimited international calling (mobile+landlines) and international text for a low cost of $110 plus taxes and fees. Believe me i checked, Verizon or AT&T have nothing in comparison to what i have with T-Mobile. And i am not bashing you or Verizon at all, Verizon does have a more reliable coverage area but in the end i sided with T-Mobile over Verizon. If Verizon ever came up with incredible deals like T-Mobile has been doing almost every month i wouldnt turn down a great opportunity. RECAP: Verizon “Better Coverage” T-Mobile “Better Prices” It all boils down to what are you comfortable with. Im comfortable with crappy coverage. And My T-Mobile calls do drop often, but what i do is (i press redial) GOTCHA :) Gust OK so here’s the deal. In the morning when you wake up if you have T-Mobile you have to get up take a shower have breakfast shave go outside of your house in other to make a phone call. If you have AT&T or Verizon in the morning when you wake up you can reach for your cell phone and make a phone call. It is that simple. But you know what I have T-Mobile because over one year it saves me about $200 as compared to AT&T or Verizon. So I put up with the crap! Timothy Poplaski T-Mobile supports WiFi calling. You don’t have home WiFi? DM725 How do you not have wifi calling enabled? Maybe you need to buy a phone from the last 2 years… (My Motorola Nexus 6 Supported Wifi Calling….) RLB63 They have equipment they they will ship out for free with a deposit that will boost their signal on your house if you don’t have Wi-Fi calling. My phone automatically switches on Wi-Fi when I get home. Not for signal or to save data. It’s because with all the talk that cell signals MIGHT cause cancer why risk it? It is able to enable Wi-Fi, and it disables it when I leave the house. So that might be an option if you have Wi-Fi…. Phone Guy All lies. So funny, yet sad. yankeesusa LOL, not everyone lives where you live and have bad coverage with tmobile. 4 years ago i would have never used tmobile, now i no longer have sprint and got rid of my verizon line because tmobile is great for me where i live and work. I just recently drove across florida,georgia,nc and tennesse and had no issues. I was able to test it side by side with an att phone and the whole time both phones had coverage except up in the smokies near newfound gap where no one has signal. Don’t lump everyone in the same pile just because it doesn’t work for you. DM725 LoL, where the hell do you live? eanfoso The only one after verizon is at&t because we know that sprint and us cellular sucks more than t mobile Andrew Singleton T-Mobile has the lowest churn rate (people trying it and leaving) of all carriers. Could you please explain why? J Gerard Ha! Oh, I promise you I don’t feel like an idiot surrounded by people who work themselves up into a breathless rant trying to defend a crappy service. gmo8492 Crappy for who exactly, churn has gone down to record lows and T-Mobile has over 73 million subs, so if it doesn’t work out you can switch. Brad C It’s not for everyone, but has worked damn well for me for 12yrs.. I *actually* tried Verizon a few months ago, and came back after two weeks after awful LTE performance JG You’re cracking me up reading your comments! I have TMo and put up with their spotty coverage because I’m paying less per month staying with them. I can admit that. There is alot I enjoy about TMo, but dropped calls and dead zones IS a reality. I have a band 12 phone in metro PHX. Not sure why others feel the need to berail someone who doesn’t agree with them just for argument’s sake. Timothy Poplaski Because you aren’t saying, “Bad coverage in PHX”, you’re saying “Bad coverage”. I can drive for at least an hour in any direction and have solid coverage. It all depends on where you live, and you’re phone. Even phones with band 12 won’t all have the same results because some phones get better reception than others. So, I won’t even argue about coverage in PHX. Never been there, likely never will, so it just doesn’t matter to me. My excellent coverage probably doesn’t matter to you. It’s all about where you use your phone. navi harriram Dude you could of tested the network out on a $10 weekly plan or $3 daily. You don’t buy cell phone service every day so do the work. The sales rep just wants a commission check so they’ll say anything to get you to switch. That’s why I don’t work for wireless companies anymore. Too much bull to deal with yankeesusa Not everyone is defending a company that may or may not work depending on where you live. But many people actually do research and pick a company that specifically works for your needs depending on your area. I had verizon and sprint before tmobile and i have never ever gotten the speeds i get now not to mention i have great coverage ‘WHERE I LIVE”, YOU SEE, that’s the important thing, i researched and made sure it worked for me. I don’t just blindly select a company just because their commercial says so. Screamin That’s strange because T-Mobile has been #1 in customer service AND satisfaction for well over 2 years now… and yes, that includes coverage. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) I am thinking about switching to Verizon due to poor coverage. In San Diego area I get one to bars. I moved from Minnesota and T-mobile coverage in MN is excellent there with all bars. In San Diego it’s very poor in some areas. When iPhone 8 is release I am switching to Verizon. I love T-mobile plans but coverage in my area is poor. Sharti24 Agreed. On base (32nd street) forget about tmobile coverage. sprint excels on 32nd. go over to corando island its even worse! just throw your phone over board. no tmobile coverage on the air base at all. im using an iphone 6s Band 12 which is deployed in SD yankeesusa I agree, if in your area tmobile is not good and is affecting productivity or just not letting you use your phone to its fullest your’e better off changing. I have great coverage where I live and work and when i travel over 99% of the time i have no issues. But i got my wife on cricket which is att so for the times where tmobile may not get signal i have the att towers just in case. I’m on an old grandfathered single line plan that allows work discount so i’m keeping as long as i can. Screamin Sometimes it’s not always the cell coverage causing the issue, but the phone itself, especially if it’s an older device that supports fewer cell bands. With T-Mobile’s latest acquirement of spectrum you can expect a huge improvement in cell signal, both in range and structure penetration, within the year. Of course you can switch if you want, but they’re only going to get better. They’ve more than doubled the coverage in the past 2 years and have just as much coverage as Verizon with a network that’s actually futureproof unlike the other guys. DM725 Agreed, I know people that don’t realize they are using a phone without band 12, that doesn’t have wifi calling or Volte support, and has an extremely weak antenna. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) My phone is iPhone 7 and not an old device: Andrew Singleton if you hold an iphone 7 next to a galaxy s8, the s8 will have more bars every time. that’s due to a more powerful signal on galaxies and the fact that bars don’t mean anything with low-frequency spectrum. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) My roommate is on T-mobile and his current phone is galaxy s8. We experience the same issue. RLB63 Have you talked to T-Mobile C.S.? If they get people complaining about certain areas they tend to look into those areas. Is it outside or inside or both where you have problems? Inside out could be the building. They can seems you a device to boost the signal for your phone. Patel Nisha You couldn’t pay me to use a iPhone . And why would I switch Verizon to T-unmobile. So I can have a sub par data connection with hardly any coverage…. Andrew Why are you on TmoNews, then? Andrew Addison Lol I was just thinking the exact same thing. Lol DM725 I’m sorry you live in a place that T-Mobile doesn’t prioritize. Here in NY, we have no such issues. Andrew Singleton the offer is also good for pixels, and you don’t know anything about the network. in 1 year, verizon will wish it had t-mobile’s network. browne81 I cavy take this anymore. There is always someone in these forums going miss information. I have to speak up. As awhole some networks are better than others. I’m not going to get into my opinion on which is better nation wide. What I will say is this. The best carrier is the one that works where you frequent the most. No matter what carrier a person loves there is another person out there that thinks it terrible. So all these people saying bad things about T-Mobile should get the facts straight. Lastly I due example I don’t like sprint but I know there are people that have a great time with them. You don’t see me on a sprint site saying how bad they are. Is my spelling perfect no. Is my grammar perfect no. It’s this a college paper? No. So I really don’t care. AJ2 still waiting for them to do a $50 deal for single customers. browne81 They have a prepaid plan for 45 Sharti24 4 for $100 sounds better Line 1 $50 Line 2 $75 Line 3 $90 Line 4 $100 John De Leon I have Verizon and would switch IF T-Mo had better in-building coverage. Several of my fellow employee friends have T-Mo and they have horrible coverage in our work locations. They have to step outside to recieve/make calls. Chris Siegell I don’t see the Galaxy S8+ mentioned? You would think that this phone would be “globally compatible” for the switch? Ming Chang Chuang did they say how long to keep the T-Mo’s Premium Device Protection Plus insurance plan? Can i remove this coverage after 2 months?

Editorial Director at Mobile Nations, analyst at iMore, video and podcast host, you can follow him @reneritchie on Snapchat, Instagram, and Twitter. Google has Tensor cores. Could Apple soon have AI cores of its own? Apple is already driving mobile silicon in a way few if any other companies have been able to keep up with. Now, a new report claims Apple will be using its considerable chipset chops to accelerate artificial intelligence as well. Mark Gurman, writing for Bloomberg: Apple is working on a processor devoted specifically to AI-related tasks, according to a person familiar with the matter. The chip, known internally as the Apple Neural Engine, would improve the way the company's devices handle tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence -- such as facial recognition and speech recognition. If true, this should surprise no one. Arguably, Apple's biggest advantage in computing right now is that the company custom crafts the complete stack, from atom to bit to pixel. That includes an ever-increasing amount of custom silicon. A few years ago, Apple offloaded motion tracking from its main A-series system-on-a-chip to an M-series sensor fusion hub. A few years later, it added onboard natural language parsing to the M-series to enable "Hey, Siri!" in as power-efficient a way as possible. The latest A-series, A10 Fusion, combines two high-efficiency cores with two high-performance cores to try to eek out as much battery life as possible while pushing pixels and bits as fast as possible. Anything that makes sense to offload to increase efficiency and performance, you can bet Apple is working on offloading. Including and especially AI, since it's such a hot topic these days. While Siri gave Apple an early advantage in voice recognition, competitors have since been more aggressive in deploying AI across their product lines, including Amazon's Echo and Google's Home digital assistants. This part reads oddly to me. Nothing against Mark, but it's a particularly bad narrative pervasive across U.S. media. Google Home is a single product. Echo is a growing line of similar, home-based products. Apple has pushed Siri from iPhone to and through iPad, Apple Watch, Apple TV, Mac, CarPlay, HomeKit, and accessories like AirPods. Apple has also expanded Siri across dozens of languages, including Chinese, Hebrew, and Arabic, as well as dozens of regions. It's fair to say no other vendor has yet been as aggressive as Apple in deploying virtual assistants across product lines or to customers around the world. "Two of the areas that Apple is betting its future on require AI," said Gene Munster, former Apple analyst and co-founder of venture capital firm Loup Ventures. "At the core of augmented reality and self-driving cars is artificial intelligence." This also reads oddly to me. Almost everything Apple does already requires AI. AI is going to be everywhere in computing the same way math is everywhere. There's nothing unique about special projects like augmented reality or cars. Machine learning, computer vision, and related technologies are already powering everything from battery efficiency to photo tagging, sequential inference to computational photography. Just because Google made its sound like they invented AI on the I/O 2016 stage, and it's now parroted alongside AR and VR the way mobile/social/local was a decade ago, doesn't mean companies like Apple (and Google) haven't been working on it for years. What's interesting isn't that the big tech giants are working on it; it's how they will use it to solve real problems in the information and computer space and, in Apple's case, how it will solve those problems while protecting our security and privacy at the same time.

Echo is growing line of similar, home based products. Apple has pushed Siri from iPhone to and through iPad, Apple Watch, Apple TV, Mac, CarPlay, HomeKit, and accessories like AirPods." ... except that Google's Assistant is available across mobile devices (Android, iOS), within Chrome I believe, not just through the Home product. And Alexa is present and capable on the Echo products as well as through the Alexa app, the Amazon app, the Fire stick, presumably the Fire TV, and so on. It's a valid comparison, correct? And - pardon my ignorance - is Siri present in Airpods independent of the phone? 0 1 week ago Reply bhatech Yeah smh at google home is a single product. Hello !!! google now, assistant, voice recognition is everywhere. 0 1 week ago Reply cuttheredwire The AirPods have a tap for Siri feature. Viticci mentioned he uses them for Siri in his latest podcast. "While Siri gave Apple an early advantage in voice recognition, competitors have since been more aggressive in deploying AI across their product lines, including Amazon's Echo and Google's Home digital assistants." Rene's point is that the media forgets that Siri is in so many places. Apple has been aggressively implementing Siri, but you would never know it by news coverage. He does *not* claim that Google is less aggressive or in fewer places in any way at all. 0 1 week ago Reply bhatech News coverage is about how Siri sucks, no one complains that's not in many places. They complain because it's bad compared to competition. 0 1 week ago Reply bhatech "This part reads oddly to me. Nothing against Mark, but it's a particularly bad narrative pervasive across U.S. media." Nothing against Rene, but it's just pro apple narrative from you, Gruber and few others on everything Apple does. At least Mark is honest even though he loves Apple products. Pretty much everyone is right Siri lacks and is just dumb compared to google. And, yeah Google does it many languages as well if that's your defense for whatever little Siri can do. On the positive side, I'm excited to see what Apple comes up and see how it can compete with Google given it has no other option other than pushing privacy story and how it can do everything on device. They would love to be like google but given the lack of their ability we have to see how well they can do this AI stuff on device and keeping privacy in mind. "Just because Google made its sound like they invented AI on the I/O 2016 stage, and it's now parroted alongside AR and VR the way mobile/social/local was a decade ago, doesn't mean companies like Apple (and Google) haven't been working on it for years." Really? You are so hurt on this? Even on MacBreak weekly you brought this up. This is what Apple does for pretty much everything in their keynote. Every feature they talk as if they invented it even though it's on competitor's device for years. 0 1 week ago Reply cuttheredwire They all try to make it sound like they invented it. Heck, people have forgotten there were smart phones before 2007. There were, but far fewer people had them. As for the narrative, I am seeing a lot of criticism on the media praising the Echo and viewing the Apple Watch as a flop. Yet I've read on multiple places that the watch sells more in volume and for a profit while the Echo is sold for a loss and fewer are sold. Numbers are not released, so I'm going to dig for the articles (but I believe Above Avalon was one of them). What is interesting is the way the Echo has caught the attention of the media. It's different and it is functional. There is plenty to write about since it is so open (too open for my tastes). The hardware is getting refreshed at a good pace too. As for Siri, yep, it needs work. Actually, it needs a way for me to tell it that, no, it did not understand me. That's really all I want… that and to have more fluid conversations. 0 1 week ago Reply Jose_Rey Really? The Echo losing money? That seems strange to me. I mean, after all, it's useless if you have no internet. It cannot do anything unless it has access to it. No timers, alarms, nada. At least that's what they said in the reviews. 0 1 week ago Reply themacbuddha How Apple approaches the digital assistant is predicated on these factors: Security/Privacy, Ubiquity, and Extensibility. Security/Privacy---Data storage and manipulation is best served on the local device when it can be and only stored and manipulated on the cloud if it can be done so at the deepest level. For a photo to be synced to and manipulated in the iCloud and for Apple to do so having excluded their ability to hold any encryption key protecting it is a very, very, very tall order. There is a reason they hired Jonathan Zdziarski. The call to crop and apply a filter needs to happen on all devices AND the cloud without compromising privacy. Keeping customer data encrypted at these levels on their servers is not in Google's best interest or even their wheelhouse. Google doesn't talk the security game. Therefor they keep themselves open to running fast and loose with your data. That means ample blood in the water for any number of bad players to go after. The trope of Google User Data Anonymization is prime for failure. Not a matter of "if" but "when". The continued treatment of end user devices as dumb terminals and the shoving of ever more data and processing power to the cloud leads to laziness on the OEM's part. We've seen this battle before. One can only assume that Samsung is not simply glomming Viv to things but actually following through on the promise of Android as a true open source solution. Don't Hold Your Breathe. Reports that Apple is creating custom silicon for managing digital dossiers should not surprise anyone. Nor should the fact that they are telling Qualcomm to take a hike now be a surprise. That they added Intel as a supplier for cellular modems is quite telling - they are going to make their own modems too. 0 1 week ago Reply themacbuddha Ubiquity---Though it might seem obvious to most the scale of this can not be understated. The "Internet of Things" is akin to the "World Wide Web" in my mind. Tremendous promise turns into absolute morass of pain. To put some perspective to something that was mentioned in an earlier post regarding the Amazon Echo line: There is plenty of talk about how wonderful Tesla is doing. Yet the Apple Watch has generated more unit sales then Echo and more revenue then Tesla. Apple Watch is primed to leap forward this fall. This is not to belabor those companies' successes but to illustrate that the reach of Apple products and there for Siri (or whatever the overall solution is deemed to be called) exemplifies how far it can go. Apple Watch can be viewed as an accessory to iPhone. And what of any Siri Speaker (hate that name) product. What of a newer wifi system that integrates and amplifies Siri and HomeKit. What of CarPlay and other integrated auto systems. Project Titan is aptly named but probably a **** lot closer than most think to producing fruit. Extensibility---Echo has both language support and security working against it. Amazon is predominately US company. However one must appreciate that it is Walmart and their ilk that Amazon is truly competing against. Don't undersell that. Google's bread and butter on the other hand is in advertising. And they will ride that pony straight in to the ground. Their forte is on the server. Their greatest success found almost exclusively within a web browser. Again...Advertising and the World Wide Web! When combined, the most hated concept in existence. They will have a difficult time assailing that wall. I foresee a lot of WTF results that is far worse the bane of Siri now. And where might Apple fit in this? Yes, yes, yes! Fluid conversation is nice but natural language is better suited. In fact it is absolutely imperative. And never mind about just simple language support. What about muddled accents and mixed languages - Spanglish anyone? Recognize the extent third party support for Siri introduces a set of complexities far, far, far beyond the chicken scratch/Graffiti approach of Google Assistant and Alexa, and is dependant on Apple growing domains instead of leaving businesses to grab at the lowest hanging fruit. Make no mistake it is not about competing against Android/Amazon/Google/Advertising/BuynLarge. It's about creating a platform for communication and commerce that doesn't bank on the gullibility of the end user. It's all my data; what I buy, who I buy it from, what I do with it? Whose to say that a viable solution positively requires that I give up that control. Just remember....the road less travelled. (All Over The Place, I Know!) 0 1 week ago Reply johnnygoodface That last sentence says it all! Yes indeed, security and privacy are the hole point of making an AI chip in the phone, so that requests are analyzed and decisions are taken locally, and not from a distant server, and this will hopefully makes the response time much faster. 0 1 week ago Reply delta4s Google and Amazon are into AI for the purpose and goal of increased efficiency in advertising and selling of your data. The promoted benefits to you personnally are a side effect and not the goal. However, Apple really needs to step up. Siri has improved but has a long way to go. Apple doesn't have the cloud infrastructure setup to process AI so it needs to do it not the device. I wonder if that data can transferred to a new device. 0 1 week ago Reply johnnygoodface "I wonder if that data can transferred to a new device."? That's indeed a very good question, one Apple should take into consideration, since all that the AI chip will have learned will need to be backup to iCloud too ---- sorry I should have replied to delta4s instead 0 1 week ago Reply Menu Log in or Sign up Search Apple Apps & Games Accessories & Toys Photo & Video Health & Fitness Movies & Music Transport Security Rumors Analysis How To The Best Reviews Deals Newsletter Forums Podcasts Android Central WindowsCentral iMore CrackBerry Connectedly TeslaCentral VRHeads MrMobile Modern Dad About Contact Us Jobs Privacy & Terms Mobile Nations 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2017 Mobile Nations Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Careers: Writer | Dev Licensing External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

Migraine World Summit’s Tools (Web): A Comprehensive List of Migraine-Fighters The Migraine World Summit is a gathering of some of the world’s leading experts on this disease. It’s a good idea to sign up for this anyway, but what’s cooler is that attendees made a list of tools to fight migraines. The list is divided into sections that target specific parts of the migraine experience, like battling an acute migraine attack or preventing migraines altogether, or factors like sleep, vision, hydration, and so on. You’ll find apps, books, exercises, advice, and a whole lot of other useful tips here. Remember, these are all advised by people who have been suffering from migraines themselves. These are tips you might not see otherwise. For example, some clinical studies have found that the right dose of ginger can abort a migraine, so you might want to eat ginger sweets and candies. 3. Palouse Mindfulness (Web): Free Course for Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Researchers have found that a particular type of meditation can help some migraine sufferers. The study also found that all migraine sufferers can safely practice this meditation exercise with no adverse effects. It’s called Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR). We’ve previously featured mindful meditation apps to improve your life 6 Mindful Meditation Apps That Will Improve Your Life 6 Mindful Meditation Apps That Will Improve Your Life Living a more mindful live through meditation can have amazing positive effects.

You’ll find videos, practice sheets, yoga demonstrations, research material, and more. The extensive FAQ section should answer any queries you might have. Potter advises that taking an MBSR course in person would be better, but this is still a good alternative. 4. Binaural Beats Therapy (Web, Android, iOS): The Right Sounds for Migraines A few studies have suggested that migraine sufferers should listen to binaural beats therapy (BBT). You’ll need headphones for this one. BBT plays two tones, one in each ear. The tones are similar, but at different frequencies. When your brain hears these two “similar but different” tones, it forms a third, imaginary tone of its own. This is called a binaural beat. BBT puts the mind in a relaxed state and helps in meditation too.

[Update: Now $75 Off] Deal Alert: Pixel 32GB (international version) is $50 off on eBay Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/05/26 2:20pm PDTMay 26, 2017 2 Plus 1 on G+ 53 Share on Facebook 57 Share on Twitter Total Shares112 Deals News Pixel Update 1: 2017/05/26 2:32pm PDT It looks like the price has dropped another $25, making this a $75 savings in total. For a device that hasn't seen much in the way of price drops or It's no secret that Google has had some serious supply issues with its flagship Pixel phone. That goes for pretty much any combination of size, color, or storage. Rumors even began to surface alleging that Google had stopped production of the devices altogether. That wasn't the case, but nonetheless, you will still struggle to actually find the Pixel if you wish to buy it. A 32GB Pixel (international version) on eBay for $50 off the list price could be the answer to that problem. This is the entry level 5" Pixel, with 32GB of storage in the color Very Silver - and it's available for $599. That's $50 less than the $649 Google is still charging for it. Beware though, this is the international version of the device. So if you live in the US you'll have to check the bands to see if it works on your network. This version won't play nice with Verizon or Sprint, so if you're on either of those carriers you can rule this out. If you live outside the US then this is definitely for you. Shipping appears to be free in the US, but here in the UK, it's $18.99. That still works out a bargain for me, especially if you account for the exchange rate. You'll have to do the sums from where you are to see if the deal is as good for you. It's worth mentioning that getting your warranty honored might be tough with this type of purchase, so bear that in mind. It's hard to say how many of these they have, other than a "limited quantity," so you'll have to be quick if you want to get your hands on arguably the best Android phone of 2016. Update 1: 2017/05/26 2:32pm PDT It looks like the price has dropped another $25, making this a $75 savings in total. For a device that hasn't seen much in the way of price drops or sales since launch, $75 off isn't bad.

Middlefinger As a back up phone yeah, its not reliable enough to be a daily driver. Its problems seem to be a mixture of hardware bugs, and Googles poor software QC. me me "bargain" JL "buggy" Gladysrcrosby Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job. Even everyone not used to this, can make $89/per h easily and the earnings can go even higher over time...

It doesnt matter how 'high end' a device is, if it doesn't work properly, its worthless. jonzey231 $50 is worth a guarantee that Google will honor the warranty....trust me...I wish I would've gotten my 6P direct. Andy What do you mean? jonzey231 If you don't buy the phone from Google, they won't help you. They send you to the manufacturer. I was forced to go to Huawei for my 6P and it was a little over 3 weeks before I got it back....and the problem is still there. Spend the extra $50 and buy it through Google so you're guaranteed to get support through their CS channels. You'll be glad you did in 6 months when something inevitably goes wrong. IMHO get the OnePlus 3T. Costs less but has better overall specs aside from the camera which is still pretty good in its own right. My brother has one and my roommate just got his last week and they both have no intention of going back to a major brand ever again. YaKillaCJ Same happened when I got the OnePlus One. It changed the way I (and many others) view a "budget" device from an unknown brand. needa I felt the same way after using an OPO for nearly three years. Got me an XL in mint condition for $450. Google edition even. Still had 3520 mAh in the batt too. Would have bought the black 3T had they been in stock. Took me three days to hunt down this deal. Andy Got my wife the pixel. Runs great. Just had the microphone problem. Google swapped without question. Wife seems to think it takes horrible selfies. Rod Weird, as it's cameras are regarded among the best currently. Random! @andy maybe you should let her know that the camera isn't the problem... It's actually her face. If you do warn her about this, I promise to visit you at the hospital. Andy Thanks for the tip. VAVAMk_2 Huzzah! Master Yates Agreed with you regarding the 3T. Lets see if the excellent updates and support evaporate when the One Plus 5 is released? That's the real test. IcerC Except in this case Google is the Manufacturer, that might change things. VAVAMk_2 Google didn't make the camera. Uses a Sony made sensor but the camera software is Google's and regarded among the best in post processing, particularly HDR. Roy Ahh so nice call me when the 1+2 will get Nougat and your friend will get or never get Android O. ddevito #Fail Andy S8 release response? AdMoc Does not ship to Poland as fck always -_- Random! Look for some service like Shipito. I believe they have an EU warehouse. Shakil Shaikh $60 shipping? kristin ANY Pixel made by google is compatible with any provider. It doesnt matter if its international or not. This writer is an odiot. Scott Scrivens https://www.techwalls.com/google-pixel-pixel-xl-model-number-differences/ Kevin Davis "Odiot", lmao. 😂 Oh, and you're wrong, too. kristin I called google about this. It would be up your phone company provider whether it worked or not. So it may not work with att or tmobile either. kristin This may or may not work on any provider. Its up to the provider. You want a pixel? Go to swappa.com and get one used in mint condition for much cheaper. Ive gotten a few phones from them since ive been on project fi and had no issues. Ill never buy a new phone again. Random! $50 off? How cute... If they get to $300 off ($350 final price) within a month, I might even convince myself it's worth to stare at those bezels everyday. Other than that (impossible) scenario, I'd rather get the 3T, Axon 7, or even the LG G5. Gjorgi Lazarovski The Pixel is probably not dropping in price anytime soon. iKon The most overrated smartphone of 2016. Only the camera is decent. Ugly ass design, overpriced and dull with no features compared to competition Roy You mean the best smartphone of 2016, best camera rare band front, best software, best updates. Great battery, great display. xyz No, he means "The most overrated smartphone of 2016. Only the camera is decent. Ugly ass design, overpriced and dull with no features compared to competition." Roy No, I'm sure he/she means "the best smartphone of 2016, best camera rare band front, best software, best updates. Great battery, great display". iKon No I meant what I said. The pixel is a flop and even Google knows it. No matter how much money they put into advertising there are alot of better choices out there.. only hard core Google fanboys try and big it up Roy Yes yada yada and still every reviewer said is the best smartphone of 2016. So.. even David here. In the on of the day it's a lots about the UI and I just don't like Samsung software. Ordeith LOL. You're such a Google sycophant, Roy. Roy You feeling really smart? I'm Imagine your ass all over your face. nirmitlamed Google is so off track in figuring out what customers wants and competing against the other monstrous companies. I would very much like to hear how many Pixels Google sold in the last year since they told us they sold more than they expected. Lawrence I can put my coffee cup on the Bezel David Nowicki I'm a big Nexus fan, but why would you pay $749 for the Pixel XL vs the OnePlus 3T at about half the price ? And soon the OnePlus 5 at $450 or so with S8+ specs will be a steal compared to the Pixel 4Ui812 Supply and demand. Limit the supply and you increase demand. It's like P.T. Barnum said , "There's a sucker born every minute".

New Level 4 Local Guides for Google Maps will no longer receive free 100GB of Drive storage Richard Gao Follow View All Posts 2017/03/03 7:30pm PDTMar 3, 2017 64 Plus 1 on G+ 120 Share on Facebook 71 Share on Twitter Total Shares255 Google News Local Guides is a program by Google Maps in which you "help others explore the world and get great benefits in return" (Google's words, not mine). Well, it looks like those great benefits are about to become merely average benefits, as Google is completely ditching free Drive storage for new Level 4 Local Guides, who currently get 100GB for one year. This removal of free Drive storage as a reward follows a similar event from back in July of 2016, when the promo for new Level 4 Guides was slashed from 1TB for two years to 100GB for one year. When that happened, we assumed that Google Maps was having too many people reach Level 4 too quickly; the same thing is probably applicable here. Here's Google's explanation: As our global community of Local Guides continues to grow, we occasionally make changes to our program. We look forward to offering our most active and consistently-contributing Local Guides more features and perks throughout the year. Not all hope is lost, though; if you're a Local Guide, you'll still receive your free 100GB if you reach Level 4 prior to March 17th at 11pm EST. As someone who's recently gotten into this whole thing, I'm probably going to be adding to my current 63 points (Level 3) quite rapidly in the span of the next two weeks.

Just reached Level 4 last week! :) mchalakov I still have my 1TB for one more year Steven Kelby Me too, but then what do we do? Forced to buy a pixel phone I guess. Or pay $125 per year. Ramon Or delete shit..Storage with expired dates shouldn't be a thing. Steven Kelby Yeah it's a trap. What a scam. JG $125 for a year doesn't sound all that bad... Though your a little high... If you buy a whole year, it's only $99.99 ($9.99/month if you pay per month). Though I really don't need a whole terabyte (right now I'm only using 1.09GBs of my 1TB+19GB)... I may go for the $19.99/year for 100GBs though... Steven Kelby I'm in Australia so it costs more here, that's AUD. I guess it's not too bad but a hard drive is much cheaper. Just need to have it networked off site at a friends house in case the house burns down! Vlad What if there's an earthquake and both your houses fall down? Steven Kelby Hopefully I'll get squashed too so it won't matter. Checkmate. Vlad That's... actually the answer I wanted. mchalakov You are not forced to do anything...your files will not be deleted even when the promo runs out. I'm pretty sure you didn't fill the full 1TB.Also you knew before that the this is a timed promotion. I really don't get the drama around here... Steven Kelby I did fill the full 1tb already, music, pics and video from my phones and cameras. It's good that it won't get deleted, I didn't know that. Đức Thành AFAIK your data won't get deleted when the extra storage expires, but in order to upload new files you'll have to either delete files to free up space or buy new space, which can be quite inconvenient at times. Kevin Brown I do too. Thanks for reminding me. I have unlimited storage through Crash Plan for my home network. I'll download my photos from Drive and upload them to Crash Plan from one of my on-site data servers. I'll write a script to pull down the photos, and let Crash Plan do its thing view every 15 minute back up. Google doesn't stick with ANYTHING, it's like an elementary school Jr Achievement "business." Never count on anything coming from Google to last. mchalakov Why ..a lot of Google services are running and lasting and still last :D Nothing is unlimited. I really doubt that you do need more than 1TB for your photos. For me on the other side - I'm working as a photographer...and I do shoot in RAW. I'm on my 2nd full TB at home :D Besides when the 1TB promo is over next year all the files will still be accessible ,you just can't upload more. Kevin Brown Tell me one service that Google's put out in the past ten years that's still running. Other than search and AdWords.. I will download because Google cannot be trusted to keep those photos. They are not customer focused one whit. I also shoot in RAW with my camera, and I too upload to my home network, which is backed up to Crash Plan. I also have a second backup to a former employer. The Google bit is just phone photos that are spur of the moment. 1639GB used as of today. That includes things like work documents, Titanium Pro backups on top of my photos. Kevin Brown Top 10 of many services Google has killed, and told customers to go eat shit and die. http://lifehacker.com/top-10-services-google-killed-off-1792897076 Andy The expiration made it pretty meaningless to me anyway.

Howard Stern ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Snuck right in since I got level 4 just last month Kevin Davis Damn, almost to level 4, I guess I'd better pick up the pace for the next couple of weeks, as the author mentioned. KingS I'm so glad I reached level last year shortly before they got rid of the 1TB offer. David Hyman Me too! Not that I am anywhere near my 1TB limit, it's nice to have Đức Thành How long does the 1 TB last? Fiorta Just claimed mine two days ago... Just in time it appears Ash The person who works so much to reach level 4, Google should give them atleast 50 GB free for life Samarth I second that! Vratislav Jindra I third that. SimonPieman Works so much by posting shit reviews consisting of "ok" for places they have never been to.. Google would have been better going for quality over quantity. Ash You are right. But not all are like this. I am at level 2 in 4 years and all my reviews are original and detailed plus i upload photos as well. It might take my another 1-2 years to reach level 4 Drakenoid I wrote detailed reviews in a rush last year when 1tb promotion was announced as being removed and got to level 4 and got the promotion but I was downgraded to level 3 for some reason, despite none of my reviews being basic. So it doesn't matter. You can try to do what I did, maybe you'll get this promotion. Ozl I reached level 4 by mostly uploading pictures mchalakov This is a risk of any service using user submitted content. They do review the reviews. kerma frog sound like you did it as well faggot Sushil Singh I have reached level 4 in 2 years and review and add photos only places i personally visit. Đức Thành If someone manages to reach level 4 in less than 4 months, they probably deserve better than 50 GB, but I'd still take what I can get. Too bad it won't even be an option. AOSPrevails I made lv4 a year ago, back when the reward was 1TB, it got so popular that Google had to nerf it to 100GB and now this. exadeci It was planned all along, they just want free workers so they attract you with advantages and make you "special" with event in their HQ but at the end of the day you work harder and for cheaper (even taking in account the advantages and events) than minimum wage workers and now that they got an army of Local Guides they don't need to offer you anything more than a "badge" Leonardo Baez I need 120pts to reach level 5, what would I get? Tizio Caio An applause Đức Thành A notification from Google that says "Congratulations on reaching Level 5 as a Local Guide!" JP How can you reach level 4 quickly? I'm at 3. Morten Ulv The quickest is probably to do quick reviews of places you've been or answer questions about places you've been. You only get one point per business if I remember correctly, so answering one question per place is enough if you really want to power through. R Gerald Saul You get one point per business, but you get a point for a review, a point for a picture, a point for updating detailed information, etc. Nicholas Conrad Airports and malls my friend. Vlad I modified the schedule of all McDonald's in my country with McDrives. They all have non-stop schedule, so I just took the list from their website and changed all of it on Google Maps. For some reason, I got dropped back to level 2 or 3 after a day, but I already redeemed my 1 TB. Drakenoid They do that, even I got dropped to level 3 (it may have been 2 but it's been an year and am on level 3 now at least) abc I've heard that being a loser with a lot of free time is very helpful. Jason Farrell Same here, but I've only reviewed stuff for fun over the years, instead of spamming crappy "OK" reviews for every little dinky place I've been to like some people do. I've got 111 of the 200 points needed to level up to lvl4, but since I'm already paying $20/yr for the 100GB there's not much point. Drakenoid Write as many detailed reviews as you can for the places you've been to, and redeem it as soon as you get to level 4. JG You can get up to 5 points per location: 1. If it's not yet on Maps, add it 2. If any information (hours, website, phone etc) is incorrect out missing, submit corrections 3. Answer some super yes/no questions 4. Write a review 5. Submit a photo You get 1 point for each, regardless if you submit multiple photos or answer multiple questions. But more never hurts. Spend a weekend walking around your local downtown, mall, and anywhere else there are a lot of businesses. If nothing else, snap a picture of each. If you know the place, answer questions about it. If you really know it, leave a review. That'll get you at least one, if not 3 points per location. Đức Thành Though these are not things I don't already have a good idea about, they're very nice and detailed tips regardless. Saved for future references, thanks. Nate Somsen I just might plug my blog, I wrote like two weeks ago, with helpful ideas on how to get those points... http://www.natesomsen.com/blog/your-guide-to-google-local-guides/ exadeci >Level 4 Guides was slashed from 1TB for two years to 100GB for one year. 100 GB for a year costs you $24, trying to get level 4 will consume you more time than it's value. 1TB for 2 years was $240 Marcell Lévai I have 148 points, so I need around 50 to get to level 4. Well, I guess I'll start taking photos everywhere. I am a paying Google Drive customer, but also a student, so not needing to pay for 100 gigs of Drive storage for a year would be nice. :P Ramon Yawn. Like..Why give storage only to take it away. So I fill half of that extra 100 GB. After it expires then what? "You're out of space, please delete. Spare me the stress. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ The old promos for Moto X for free 1 yr. storage said anything on the drive would stay there, but you couldn't add anything when the year expired. Zorak✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵉᵛᶦˡ And that "anything" includes email attachments, found out the hard way. Vlad No, that includes not being able to receive emails. It's on their FAQ... Zorak✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵉᵛᶦˡ Not sure if you're trying to confirm or contradict, but since you initiated your statement with a negative I'll assume it's the latter so allow me to offer this anecdotal evidence, when my free storage period ran out I kept receiving notifications telling me to delete contents to be able to receive emails. But if in fact you're trying to confirm you should read PixelXLellence's comment and my reply again. Hint: I referenced to the "anything" on the later part of the sentence. Vlad Oops, sorry. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ +1 for the Zorak avatar https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/space-ghost.jpg?w=805 Zorak✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵉᵛᶦˡ Heh, thanks. I tried to find someone more Evil™ than Dick Dastardly and who better than Zorak. And it worked. I'm way more evil now and the politically correct bunch finds me unequivocally detestable. https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b2/Space_Ghost_Coast_to_Coast.png P.S. It's all in the eyes. Morten Ulv If you already pay for it, you save like 20 bucks that year. Oh joy. :P Jesús Cuenca Once i got $20 from google to use on cabify, that was nice :v Impulse_Vigil Dang, I'm at 52 pts, time to get contributing. Đức Thành You can make it. I believe in you. Miku is Best Vocaloid I need to hurry the fuck up, I'm level 3. Đức Thành Same, been contributing since January. How long have you been a Local Guide? Miku is Best Vocaloid Since September, I wasn't very active the last few months. Đức Thành How many points have you got? I had 87 points yesterday, and today I'm at 112. Wanna bet on who will level up first? :D Morten Ulv Oh right. I got level 4 back in november, but wanted to wait to redeeming it. Missed the part about expiration after 30 days. Oh well, not like I really need it anyway, seeing as photos are free and it expires after a year. JPLoureiro I contribute for fun and don't expect much in return except for some geeky stats and badges, though some credit for Google play would be nice as well. Đức Thành Same but this news still makes me upset for some reason. I wasn't even aware of the rewards before this (I was vaguely aware that there were awards for Local Guides but that's it, and I'm not even doing this for the rewards). I wonder what this phenomenon is called. Rok Tur! Another job illuminated by technology the critic LOL Same, I like to give fair reviews etc, and I always read other reviews when I go to places. Google credits or some T-shirts would be nice for every level up Chips N I wasn't aware of the program. I knew I got "points" or gained levels for it, but I thought it was just "pointless" fun, no pun intended. It would always ask me nonstop about places I've driven past or places I go in to for a quick five minutes and then leave (just browsing, etc.) If they gave even a penny for each review (in credit), I'd be a tad more tempted to put some thought into leaving a review, for places I've actually been to, of course. Trent I hit level 5 a while back and just recently passed 5,000 points. I hope and think that the reason for these scale backs is to give people like me more incentive to go for the new tiers when they're announced. Đức Thành Well fuck me, 2017 has been a quite effortful yet unrewarding year so far. Not counting many other things mostly unrelated, I've begun actively contributing to Google Maps for the last three months, and while I've added several places, made edits, posted hundreds of photos (reached over 15.000 views just a few days ago) and written quality reviews and yet this is all I got from Google: https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b1f85b49be32e63f852423898894791d3b68700553c85aa1791d8352a68cbe1b.png It's just not a very fair system. And now I have to add "getting 87 more Local Guide points in the next 2 weeks" to the list of things to do, if I want to get a reward. Life just doesn't let you catch a break, as it would seem. Maxr1998 Yeah, I also think that's very unfair.. I'm living in the countryside, so it took ages for to reach lvl 3, now I won't even get storage anymore once I finally reach lvl 4. Oh, btw, 87 to 200 is an additional 113 points.. Đức Thành I feel for you man. My problem is mostly a technical one, as I find the whole process of sharing photos to Google Maps from Google Photos to be quite cumbersome (my Nexus 5 has 2-3 GB to store new photos and I back up and delete local photos every 1-2 days or so, so when I get into the mood of actually contributing to Google Maps every few days, I would have to dive into Photos, find photos of places I took few days prior and download them, then upload to Maps; and while this doesn't sound like that much of a problem it becomes a problem for me as I take a *shit load* of photos everyday). 113 points? Well shit, I guess that means more work for me, then. Shon G. I just uploaded about 20 pictures directly from Photos. Đức Thành The problem is I also want to do a review when I add photos, or at least get credited for it, but the way Maps currently implements it, if you add photos directly from Photos via Maps's suggestions it does neither and your contributions stay anonymous. Which is kinda pointless to me. Drakenoid Maps should show your photos from Google photos backup in the app itself, so try that out. Đức Thành I am well aware, what I am complaining about is Maps's current implementation of it. Đức Thành Dunno if you're interested, but I'm here to report on the progress and this is what I managed in the span of one day (going out has been costly and time-consuming and I'm wondering if this is really worth it): https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/6b084860808db2c74a19d67429f11e554a5f1b88fc19f5c0b3d9f9e1c6b308b8.png So um, let's see, 88 points to go? This is getting increasingly harder than I thought. But at the same time if you view this as a game it could be quite a fun challenge. By the way, how many points have you got? I think there are a few things you can do to earn points even if you live in the countryside, like visiting monuments and adding new landmarks and whatnot. Just a suggestion. Maxr1998 Great work! I was at 104 15 minutes ago, but you reminded me to open GMaps and now I'm at 111. I might be able to get to 200 until March 17 if I push myself hard enough, but it still sucks to have to hurry so much. Also, since the promotion is only valid one year, it doesn't help me much since I have 100 GB since March 2018 anyway, because of my HTC phone from last year. Would have loved to be able to continue with a fresh year of 100 GB next year, by then finishing my Local guide lvl, but now I will probably have to pay then (I actually need the 100GB for my photos). Maxr1998 So a little update from my side, I hope that you managed to reach lvl 4, I didn't. I got to around 145, 55 more points just wasn't possible (and I still didn't reach it, currently 152). In the end I didn't even bother anymore, I'll probably just buy a subscription next year when my HTC Promotion ends, as I would have had to do anyway, so no real loss for me tbh.. Đức Thành Sorry for the late reply (thanks to crappy ISPs in my country I have had to use a VPN service every time I want to read any disqus comments and I am just too busy to bother nowadays), but here's some update from me as well. I did actually manage to reach Lv 4 more than a day before the deadline, and I still get emails from Google Maps team notifying me about how many views my photos get (more than 100.000 views the last time I checked), but I never did receive any news about the storage reward. I almost went to post a complaint on Local Guides community, but in the end I decided it wasn't worth it. So here's the funny thing: I was very active in contributing to Google Maps before, and I never really cared about getting the reward and certainly wasn't even aware that there was a reward system before I read this news about Google reducing the reward. But after this whole thing I completely stopped posting anything thanks to a lack of motivation. I think the reward system kinda ruined this hobby for me and turned it into some labor work; and thanks to how badly Google manages the reward system's actual execution, it turned into unrewarded work in the end. Now I don't even bother thinking about this as it leaves a bad taste, and it's ironic that I used to make really good photo posts and reviews before this happened, and it used to be fun. So I guess your not making it is actually a fortune thing, haha. KingS Yeah i feel ya. I got a photo with over 3 million views and it only counts as 1 point, like a photo with only 20 views. Anyways, Id recommend taking a lot of photos when youre out and about, because Google Maps will suggest you add them and they each doing as a point. Also, andere questions about businesses you've been to and keep your reviews short, but detailed. Đức Thành I already do that, maybe much more than I can possibly be expected of, simply because I like to do things properly and thoroughly, but thanks! I will keep it up. Michael D. Local guides are improving Google Maps for free, something that would otherwise would cost lots of money, and this is how Google is thanking us? I'm already a level 4 guide but seeing that there are no real benefits for all the work I've done and the data I've been submitting, I will stop doing so. I've been doing this just for fun, but in reality I've been helping them acquire costly data. Well, that's about what does it. henleyb I do it just to help others and overall hopefully ensure companies improve their services etc. The extra benefits are nice but feel a little shallow with it being for just the year. Especially since if you use it blindly you're then going to have to move all your data before it expires or start paying. Why not give 20GB for life or something, that would be a nice gesture for Google to acknowledge that while we are helping others we're also helping their company too. Either way, I find Google maps incredibly helpful for a vast range of reasons so I'm happy to contribute to 'pay back' and hopefully make it better for everyone without any rewards. Đức Thành Same, I'm a little disappointed in Google tbh but the reason I will keep contributing regardless is going to be because of the community. I was a nerd (still am) who didn't know the street names inside a 1 km diameter around my own area just a year ago, but thanks to people's contributions to Maps I can go out with much more confidence now and I am getting to know way more streets and new interesting places (even helped me with several jobs in the outskirt of my hometown), so being able to contribute back to the community can be seen as a reward in itself. Still disappointed in Google, though. Oh well. LOL Google has been a bunch of cheap little motherfuсkers lately Hamilton Jimenez Vasquez Totally agreed with you, Im level 4, but lately Im losing my inspiration for contributing. Cakefish I'm currently Level 3. It's like an addictive minigame. A clever way of crowdsourcing information. Corey Munns I reached level 4 back in December but still haven't gotten my 100gb. Emily My 100 GB only lasted 4 months anyway. When it prematurely ended, I went round and round with help desk people. In the end Drive people said they couldn't help me because it was a Local Guides thing, and Local Guides people said they couldn't help because it was a Drive thing. x.Ramin What about your data? Does it get deleted too? Đức Thành Carl Sagan Dammit Google, I probably should add this "Drive vs. Local Guides rewards contradiction thing" to the "list of things to resolve when I become the head of Google one day," if that issue still hasn't been resolved by then. (Typing this with a straight face because I'm completely and totally serious.) Light I was working on it. Reviewing everywhere I went and all. Well then, I'll just stop and continue on Tripadvisor. No reward, no help building the platform. At least Tripadvisor is mainstream, so I contribute to something people actually use for reviews at least. Đức Thành TripAdvisor is even worse when it comes to the process of making contributions though. Really inconvenient and effortful, and not as many people get to reap the benefits from your reviews either. Chronos90 Do I have to do something to get this reward? I was close to Level 4 and added another review which took me to Level. Didn't got any notice yet LOL I'm almost level 6 bitchеs Margaritas Ante Porcos People are as greedy as orthodox priests. All good deeds need to be paid, otherwise no reviews. eep2378 Good thing I'm level 4 already...😀 Ailín Ó’S I still have the 1TB of free storage but I'm not sure how I feel about this. On one hand it will help limit people reviewing places they've never been to with a "cool" or "good" or whatever just to get the points but on the other it no longer incentivises people to genuinely contribute to the app and make it better. belac77 I wonder if they'll replace it with another perk? mchalakov Whoa...chill everybody. Even though we as Local Guides are helping Google ,we are also helping each other. Especially in some areas which you don't have any information. The moment you started doing this you knew there is going to be nothing in return or if there is anything it's a limited promotion. So if you want 100GB buy it it's $2 /month. kerma frog how bout no? Maleko Wow... I did a lot to get to Level 4 to redeem that free storage, and I did it with decent photos and decent reviews etc... Firstly it's pointless to have the storage expire, especially when Google don't offer 500GB in their storage tariff. Now to remove the incentive totally... dick move. GarethSargeant 100 reviews since yesterday. Sticking with places I've been to though. My name is…. And thats why they dont offer GB any more. Nate Somsen You'd think that Google would have some kind of algorithm to detect an unnatural increase in contributions in such a short amount of time... Đức Thành Why though? Regardless of the frequency of new photos and reviews, it's the accuracy and quality that matters, right? Some people like to take lots of photos of places but don't contribute right away every time, and when they do it in their spare time just have to batch-process a bunch of new places, I think it should be fair game. Ohid Khan https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/6d2b4544c67bb885685a2487b72f82a4d31c0735e832702b911d6210b1a3a29c.jpg Wendy’s Angels Does she come from a pedophile family? She's another like chelsea handler, with her old slutty self, creaming over Obama. Doby Gillis Your dementia is kicking in. WTF does that have to do with the article? Dirge No worries, I got the 1TB free for 2 years back in July. TheScienceEnthusiast1130 LMFAO Google = $$$ SB Level 5 - 167 photos - over a million views. Geoff Johnson Glad I got in when it was 1TB, which is good through March 2018. Андрей Бельский And what if i have been of 4th level (long ago) and will reach 5th level. will I get this 100gb storage as promotion? Biggles Remember when the Google motto was "don't be evil"? We've done a pile of work for Google for free. It'd cost them a lot of money to either buy the data if they could buy it somewhere, or cost them a lot of money to hire people to do data entry. Either way, it saved them forking out. And it improved their search and maps tremendously, so that it strengthened their grip of the market and they make yet more money. The cost to them was drive space, and probably so little in financial terms that they'd struggle to actual calculate it. People are upset less because of the cost of Drive storage, less because the perks changed, but more because Google made out they cared about their users and having a community of local guides. And it turns out that they don't care. Anthony I'm happy I hit level 4 back when it was 1tb. I didnt know it went down. Anthony https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/18c73e40001f06e7055d333e9d4ad4b7ac0a0c1db1e2b065f1971cce06ae3d02.png Omega192 ITT a bunch of entitled whiners. Oh, you've "done a pile of work for Google for free"? They've been providing many if not most of their services to you for free, Maps included. If you really cba to contribute to Maps unless you're given something in return, then go right ahead and stop contributing. No one is forcing you to continue. Wouldn't be surprised if this was brought on by people leaving low effort reviews just to get to the point they were rewarded. God forbid Google take steps to lessen that rather than just shell out unlimited rewards at a loss. chimichanga I've reached level 4 a few days ago but still haven't seen an increase in Google Drive space. How long does this usually take? Was thinking it would be more or less imminent. chimichanga all good, have actually received it now Vladislav Shumkin so the bonus drive space just arrives later automatically? or you need to apply somewhere to redeem? chimichanga yes, an email to activate the free storage arrived around 3 days after I reached level 4 Anthony C Russano III I was lucky enough to secure the FREE 1TB before they pulled it. I am so stoked on that one. hehehe Follow Android Police 1.49M 472k 145k 119k Latest Deals 9 [Deal Alert] Chromecast Ultra is $59.99 ($10 off) at Google Store, Best Buy, B&H and others 2017/06/04 12:16pm PDTJun 4, 2017 13 [Deal Alert] Google Home is $109 ($20 off) at Best Buy, Google Store, B&H, and others 2017/06/04 10:07am PDTJun 4, 2017 12 [Deal Alert] Kick off the weekend with 24 temporarily free and 52 on-sale apps 2017/06/03 6:50pm PDTJun 3, 2017 18 [Deal Alert] Get a Nextbit Robin for $129.99 on eBay 2017/06/03 9:39am PDTJun 3, 2017 33 [Deal Alert] A Stork's Journey is currently free on Google Play Movies & TV 2017/06/01 10:50pm PDTJun 1, 2017 Latest Poll How many photos are on your Google Photos account?

By Jason Ward Friday, May 26, 2017 at 12:00 pm EDT 69 Comments Jason L Ward is a columnist at Windows Central. He provides unique big picture analysis of the complex world of Microsoft. Jason takes the small clues and gives you an insightful big picture perspective through storytelling that you won't find anywhere else. Seriously, this dude thinks outside the box. Follow him on Twitter at @JLTechWord. He's doing the "write" thing! "Mobile first, cloud first" has been Microsoft's CEO Satya Nadella's guiding mantra for the company since 2014. Things have recently changed, however. Nadella often says mobility is not about a single device but rather the mobility of a user's experiences across many devices supported by an intelligent cloud. Google's CEO Sundar Pichai said in an interview just before Google I/O 2016 that he's "on a journey from mobile to AI." The interview further expounded: "Pichai is also focused on shifting Google's journey from 'mobile-first to AI-first.'" Coincidentally, during his keynote at Build 2017, Nadella shared that Microsoft too is moving from a mobile-first, cloud-first vision to one that places AI at the forefront. So is Microsoft following Google? The future of the PC is a family of devices connected by an intelligent cloud Shift from mobile first, cloud first? Nadella stated the following during his Build 2017 keynote: We're moving from what is today's mobile-first, cloud-first world to a new world that is going to be made of an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge. [The] user experience is getting distributed across devices. It's no longer just mobile first ... it's not about one device, an app model for one device. The user experience itself is going to span all of your devices ...Your personal digital assistant by definition is going to be available on all your devices. [As] you move between devices it's going to be there helping you gets tasks done. Nadella during his Build 2017 keynote. Oddly, it seems that Nadella is defining mobile first as being centered around one device and a single app model, rather than how he historically defined it. Furthermore, his shift toward an intelligent cloud and intelligent edge vision now adopts the "mobility-of-experiences" definition he historically applied to his mobile-first, cloud-first vision. He further explained this platform shift has an AI focus that benefits from investments in the "edge of the cloud." Serverless computing allows for pieces of logic to exist outside of the bounds of a virtual machine (VM) making that logic mobile. Existing on the "edge of the cloud" where hundreds of gigabytes of data can be processed for tasks such as those associated with an autonomous or connected car, computational power moves to the cloud's edge. Nadella explained that AI in such an environment is more distributed. Clearly, Microsoft's "mobility-of-experiences" vision remains unchanged, though it resides beneath an AI-first umbrella. Furthermore, investments in AI have been a decades-long strategy for Microsoft. Given these facts, one must wonder if Nadella's public setting of a new pole star from mobile first, cloud first to an AI-focused guidance is a reactive measure to Google's clear dedication to and observable success in the same. Google's all about AI Like Microsoft, Google invested in first-party hardware but for different reasons. Microsoft's hardware strategy positions a growing family of Windows 10 devices as an actual and aspirational medium for the Universal Windows Platform (UWP). Google's hardware strategy provides a platform for its AI vision. Both Microsoft and Google are invested in hardware, though for different reasons Google's earlier AI, Google's Now, was founded on the popular industry-leading Google search engine. Its ability to serve and anticipate a range of Android and iPhone users' needs made it a leading personal assistant. Unlike its rivals, Apple's Siri and Microsoft's Cortana, however, it lacked attributes that made it personal. With Google Assistant, which is described as a user's personal Google, the Mountain View company has attempted to reframe the powerful search engine as every individual's personal Google. Ok, Google Assistant Google Assistant is more personal than its predecessor and gets to know users over time. During Google I/O 2016, the Google Home smart speaker, the Pixel smartphones, and Google's new messenger Allo were all introduced as platforms for the Assistant. Truth be told, Google Assistant is as much a defensive move as it is an offensive move for Google. In an app- and AI-dominated world, "search" is no longer just a destination we go to; it's integrated into our apps and digital assistants. Google confronts this challenge to its core (ad revenue) business by making search personal and marketing Assistant as an evolution of the familiar Google search engine. Google wants users to know its AI has the advantage of being based on the world's leading search engine. Rishi Chandra, vice president of product management for Google's living room devices, said: "There is no better engine of answering any question that you have. We fundamentally believe that." Microsoft may fear that this is true given the number two position of Bing and consumers' general lack of awareness of Cortana. Google's AI push This year, Google expanded its AI vision by adding Google Assistant to smartwatches, Android TV, cars and the iPhone (joining Siri and Cortana). The company also expanded the Assistant's ability through Google Home and Chromecast. Visual responses from Google Home can now appear on the TV. Google I/O 2017. Google Lens, the company's AI-driven camera app, allows users to point their phones' cameras at people, places and things to glean information about them based on Google's extensive knowledge graph. Like Microsoft and the 2016 private preview release and recent general release of the Cortana SDK, Google has released the Assistant SDK. Third parties can now integrate Assistant into their hardware as Cortana was incorporated into the Harman Kardon speaker. Microsoft, Cortana and AI In 2014, while the tech world was focused on health platforms, wearables and the rumored bigger iPhones, Microsoft was fine-tuning its AI vision. Cortana was about to make its debut on Windows Phone. Beyond a mere voice assistant, it was obvious then Cortana had potential as an intelligent UI for transient computing across Windows devices. AI, bots and canvases: An evolving view of Microsoft's AI vison In early 2014, few foresaw Microsoft's embrace of the iPhone and Android, however, though by July 2015 it was evident. Nor did I see, then, Cortana as a singular artificial intelligent UI for users' experiences across Windows, iOS and Android bound together by the Microsoft graph, as demonstrated at Build 2017. Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer gave a forward-looking description of the unifying effects of Microsoft's graph in 2013. His statements are specific to Windows devices but foreshadow Microsoft's Windows-as-a-hub, binding users' cross-platform experiences: The experience we will deliver across all our devices centers on the idea of better connecting people with the things they care about most ... files, documents, photos, videos, notes, websites, snippets, digital history, schedules, tasks, and mail and other messages, combined with real-time information from our devices and services. It is more than what we think of as the shell today, and no current label really fits where we are headed. The shell will support the experiences layer and broker information among our services to bring them together on our devices in ways that will enable richer and deeper app experiences. Microsoft's graph as a unifier of all platforms and experiences is a vital part of the company's AI and platform vision. As a single underlying "super platform," Microsoft's graph enables Cortana to become the UI for experiences for all platforms. This approach to AI in conjunction with Cortana's democratization via the SDK makes Microsoft's strategy a worthy contender to Google's well-positioned Assistant. Are Microsoft's AI efforts following Google's? Microsoft began investments in machine learning, natural language processing, and deep neural networks long before Google became an AI-first company. Ballmer and Gates pave way for Nadella's AI vision In the following video, Microsoft Research's Eric Horvitz talks about the company's investments in AI: During Build 2016, Microsoft introduced Conversation as a Canvas and the Bots Framework. Nadella also described Cortana as a meta-app that would interface with bots. Apps such as Skype, WhatsApp, Line, Slack and others were described as canvases for conversations that would connect with bots and AI, and human language was then identified as the UI. This year's integration of iOS and Android into the Microsoft graph and Cortana's positioning as its UI is the progression of an AI vision at Microsoft that had early roots in Microsoft Bob. So, no, Microsoft is not following Google's AI efforts. I believe, however, that Nadella's statement shifting Microsoft from a mobile-first, cloud-first motto is a deliberate public acknowledgment of his awareness of how important and competitive AI has become and will be. Considering Microsoft's already considerable investments in and previously communicated plans for AI, I believe Microsoft wanted the industry and competitors to know that, like Google, Redmond is all about AI.

I feel you might be thoroughly versed in Google and Apple's efforts and largely just beginning research on Microsoft's efforts via build or others?    Some AI related questions that might broaden this article.  Why did MS choose the more expensive FPGA option instead of Google going the cheaper route.  How would that infrastructure  affect AI?  Does Google have similar cognitive services available? Tensor-flow how does it compare  Does Apple?  Are they available for all devs to work on or just a feature on their app?  Does Google have an IOT program like MS-IOT, are cognitive services or AI available for them?  What is intelligent edge does their competitors have something similar, how are they different?  We now have cortana skills how is it different from alexa's skills, do other competitors have it as well.  bot framework, what is it, how did it come to be, how is it different from wechat (the first messaging app to employ bots) and how does it use AI?  Then you could wrap it all up.       AI is more than just digital assistants.   0 1 week ago Reply Jason Ward Thanks for the feedback, Kram.

The interview further expounded: "Pichai is also focused on shifting Google's journey from '*mobile-first to AI-first.'"* Thanks for jumping in!🙂 The advantage Google has is their consumer success. Google Now and Assistant have more mindshare than Cortana which from a consumers perspective makes it appear Googles ahead. Computer and cloud i intelligence is far deeper than assistants' as we know and Microsoft's platform position with integrating intelligence in products, Services etc is "invisible" to many consumers. Thanks again! 0 1 week ago Reply Drael646464 I think there might be more money here in enterprise. Farmers, manufacturers, labourers can all use IoT in a way that improves business. For the average person, turning the lights on when you get home, or playing your favourite tune when you get into the bath would be nice, but its more of a luxury, and as such, not as worth the expenditure. By contrast enterprise would spend millions, billions, for the right AI/IoT products.  That's not to say consumers won't use AI or IoT products, just that I doubt they'll have rapid product adoption, or be wildly profitable for quite some time yet. Makers would have to prove some functional or entertainment value. ATM its mostly gimmicky. I think google knows its in trouble. A large company like apple could take dark data (the internet), catergorize it into tags, and use those tags to match topic questions via AI (interestingly apple recently brought the former, and partnered into the later via IBM).   A purely content based search would beat a marker based one hands down. Perhaps thats a machine learning product that would be very hard to create, given its broader and more complex than most such applications, but if anyone ever makes one, and they have mindshare like apple does, they could kill googles core business virtually overnight.  -1 1 week ago Reply Drael646464 Just as interestingly Apple also hired a project manager for a "search engine capable of supporting hundreds of millions of users", or at least placed an ad for such, back in 2015.

Which is why I will NOT waste my money on that stupid Harman-Kardon speaker. Yet another piece of hardware battling with my other hardware to hear, understand and react to my commands.  Microsoft's approach to AI will begin to mature when Cortana recognizes ME, absolutely uniquely, and does so as ONE entity regardless of how many devices are within earshot (or, eventually, visual range).  1 1 week ago Reply gchand05 Security however is a concern. The thought is that the more an AI knows about me, the more useful it is but at the cost of my personal security. I think Apple has a slight ACE up their sleave here.

The article points to a shift some may not have known occurred in Nadella's guiding principal from the well known mobile-first cloud-first motto to an AI-focused one. It then frames that in a slightly broader context including one of Microsoft's main competitors (though there are others) who competes on the broadest range of similar services than any of MS other rivals: cloud, productivity, AI, hardware etc. (Other rivals compete with MS on less fronts.) Also, not all readers here, as MS fans, watch the competition as closely as others, so by providing the context of Googles AI foundations, progress and hardware strategy that is AI focused (whereas Microsoft's is UWP focused) readers can see where MS sits in relation to Google. This provokes critical thinking to see MS in relation to the broader picture rather than in a microcosm. Pointing then to Microsoft's long AI, machine learning, deep neural network history brings a history to the forefront that may be being overshadowed by Google's very public and consumer recognized AI efforts with Google Home, Assistant, ect. Some folks because Google's AI efforts are very consumer facing on the large Android platform may not realize the investments Microsoft has made and is making in AI. This article provides that information and perhaps let's some who think MS is following Google's AI strategy know, (because of thier consumer facing progress), that "No" MS is not following Google. You point out that I open with a question "is MS following Google and close with the response "No" they are not." And you then present that that partial conclusion (you missed the fuller answer as I pointed out at the beginning of this reply) as if a "No" somehow takes away from what is communicated.

Obviously Microsoft has decades worth of investments in AI and is not following Google's very respectable advancements in the area. What I found interesting as I watched Satya Nadella's Build 2017 keynote, however, was his very clear and deliberate departure from the mantra we Windows phone fans know all too well, "Mobile-first, Cloud-first", to an intelligence-driven (AI-driven) guidance. It immediately reminded me of Google's CEO Sundar Pichai's departure from a mobile-first, to an AI-first focus that he articulated a year ago. Clearly, Microsoft has had investments in AI for years, but only now is it placing the emphasis on AI as it's guidance as Google did last year. What do you think? Is Microsoft trying to make sure the industry and competitors know that it's AI strategy is a priority by placing it as the public guidance for the company, rather than Mobile-first, cloud-first philosophy (which Nadella articulates is still part of the company's strategy by the way)? The industry is increasingly AI-driven from IoT, mixed reality, Surveillance Tech and more. Public perception is a part of industry rival battles just technology advancement's and products. I think it was was for MS to "update" it's guiding philosophy to an AI-driven one to match it's investments and the industry's direction. Google's jump on this a year earlier of course, gives it the perception as being more forward-thinking here. What do you think? Was Microsoft being reactive here? Were they to slow to focus thier public message and philosophy with an alignment with it's AI investments allowing Google to position more aggressively as more forward thinking in regards to an AI-driven focus. LET'S TALK! 4 1 week ago Reply salazka AI  is very much Cloud First.  And of course, no, MS is not following Google's  "lead"  however Google is the most populist brand of all, and as such it has better success in marketing terms.

Beating someone in GO, is different than running an entire city with an AI heart, (IBM does that without a making much fuss about it,) or leading in image and voice recognition etc. etc. as Microsoft does. Cortana is not AI, not by a longshot, but it should be empowered by AI if Microsoft wants Cortana to thrive and their hidden deeply undergound marvels to come to the surface.  Last but not least, for AI to work, it needs a lot of data, data that is acquired by users as they go about their daily usage scenarios. And while google  has a "carte blanche" there, Microsoft is constantly a victim of endless ridiculous press bourne witchhunts.

I think google is smart to be AI first right now, because someone like apple could beat them at their own game with an AI that actually catergorizes content rather than uses markers. MS on on the other hand, like apple, and sony have the potential for AR/VR markets - because they have more powerful hardware under their platforms.  This is another reason why google has to be AI first - phones will not be a profit core of VR/AR. Googles best chance of future proofing itself is the IoT.  0 1 week ago Reply Stephen Townsley Microsoft isnt following Google's lead but heading to a different space. Google is strong in the consumer space. It occupies 80% of the smartphone market and it's devices are available globally. It's leveraging that Google AI is an "ambient presence" everywhere. Amazon is it's main competition with Alexa. Microsoft Cortana is only fully functional in the USA and only really present on the PC for all practical purposes. Microsoft are largely ignoring consumer and are hitting the enterprise sector using their on-premise dominance to move to hybrid and full cloud adoption. The Google consumer has a cheap TV solution in chromecast, a mobile phone solution, an assistant solution. The Microsoft consumer has a $400 Xbox One for movies, Cortana that is only fully enabled in the USA, no mobile platform for 99% of consumers and no home voice control interface. On the latter they are 18 months behind and are waiting for a partner to produce a "US Only" device. There is nothing wrong with being an enterprise company. Nadella's mission was not innovation but shareholder value.  The easiest way to summarise this is that you can get 5 installs for a family edition of Office 365 but Groove music still has no family plan after many years. It's not following Google but rather Microsoft is on a parallel track in which consumer isn't included. 1 1 week ago Reply Urbautz Then i have a different Cortana than yours. It run's on my Lumia 950, it runs on my Blackberry DTEC50, it runs on my Surface 3. It even runs in my BMW iDrive when the phone is connected.  Also, i control my smart home via Homematic and Phillips Hue (both have 3rd party Cortana enabled apps) And the only piece of addintional hardware i needed for this is the Windows Hello Capable Webcam for my Desktop.    1 1 week ago Reply Stephen Townsley Cortana is different in different markets. The US has the full feature set whereas the UK, where I am, doesn't support flight tracking from email messages. (Having said that I am flying on holiday at the weekend so I will see if it picks up on that) 0 1 week ago Reply bleached Ie8irri8jdriiiiidjdiijdc in fr r orídosee xiiiii a irríddrîdrkdyid Dr 00id oii in djdPhone -1 1 week ago Reply 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2016 Mobile Nations • Terms and Conditions • Privacy Policy • Careers: Writer | Dev • Licensing • External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

Google is now offering four free months of Google Play Music for new subscribers Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/26 2:17pm PDTMay 26, 2017 82 Plus 1 on G+ 614 Share on Facebook 102 Share on Twitter Total Shares798 Google News Right now it looks like Google is running a special offer for Google Play Music. New subscribers that sign up here can get four free months of service instead of the usual three. No telling how long this offer might last, so if you have been considering subscribing, now might be the time to do it. It could save you an extra $10. Again, this particular offer is only for new subscribers. I've been a fan of Play Music for a long time, though the device removal limit does get in the way when you switch between devices and ROMs as often as I do. Being able to mix your own library with those of a service also comes in handy. That way I can continue to support artists I am passionate about, without eschewing the larger selection of a subscription offering for the purposes of content discovery, all while being able to fill the gaps in that library. There are a lot of different music services out there, but if you're interested combining your curated library with music available via a subscription, then your options are limited. Spotify does allow you to play back locally stored files, which is convenient, but it isn't quite the same. Amazon also allows you to upload your music for playback via Amazon Music, and with Amazon Prime membership, you get a small library of streaming music to go along with that. For $10 a month ($8 for Prime members) you can access their full library as well. But, Google Play Music has a great interface and plugs nicely into all the other Google services we love. Maybe with this new offer, it's time you gave Google Play Music a chance? After all, even if it doesn't end up working out, you still got four free months of music out of the deal.

Carson Saldanha Wait, wdym 3 different countries? Did you share it with others or something? Ailín Ó’S I live in Ireland, so that's my main account. I have a secondary account based in England as part of a mail forwarder service I use, and my bf is Greek so I had him check the code on his account :) Carson Saldanha Oh wow! Carson Saldanha Hey, since I know it worked for you, are you able to use YouTube Red along with this Play Music free trial? Because my YT Red doesn't seem to be enabled for me. Ailín Ó’S No, unfortunately not as I live in the EU and YouTube Red is only available in USA. Carson Saldanha Weird, I'm in the US though. Ailín Ó’S Ooh that is odd. Sign out of the app then sign back in maybe? Carson Saldanha No luck :( I'm in contact with Google support atm Hopefully they can sort this out Mike Worth it alone for Youtube Red MisterAlex Sweet, I wasn't sure if that was included. Thanks. Should mention that in the main blog post. Ben Still no student membership >:( Ailín Ó’S Spotify is a great alternative @€$£5/month. Ben I know that's what I use just because it's half the price. Ailín Ó’S In Ireland Vodafone have a partnership with Spotify whereby it costs €5 standard instead of €10 regardless of if you're a student or not, they even bundle it with some of their plans. Vodafone do the same in some other countries they operate in (not all). Maybe see if any network in your country has a partnership like that? Worth a shot! Ben Oh yeah I'm on EE in the UK and I've got Apple Music for free for 6 months but like iTunes is a massive stinking turd. Ailín Ó’S I'd rather go back to the days of getting music via Bluetooth from friends than use crApple Music 😂😂 Rahul Krishna In india, we have play music for 1.4 usd/month Umang Ladia I'm only seeing 2 months offer in India.?? Rahul Krishna Well I subscribed to it when it launched here (about 2 months ago), so I can't confirm that. But at this price, there is nothing to be disappointed about. aRvInD I wish Spotify launches soon here. I can't keep using that patched version here...!! Rahul Krishna Me too xyz As it should be, you can't charge European or American prices in India. Rahul Krishna Yes true. There are lots​ of people here with a very cheap Android phone. They cannot pay much money. Julian Coronado That's actually what's keeping me away from Play Music. I've used my free months and I loved the Youtube Red too. But as a student, Spotify for $5 / month is too great to pass up on. Emiliejmosley Google is paying 97$ per hour! Work for few hours & have longer with friends and family! !sm141c: On tuesday I got a great new Land Rover Range Rover from having earned $8752 this last four weeks..

Cakefish Spotify ftw ToniCipriani ✓pǝᴉɟᴉɹǝʌ I don't think this is a new offer, got this a while back. In fact my 4 months is expiring next week. Prefer Spotify over it. Song selection a tad bit weaker, and for foreign songs it tries to translate the song names to English and makes it hard to look up. folkrav I like it, it's way cheaper than Spotify for me - my mother, my sister, my wife and myself each pay 30$ a year and we're set - but Jesus do I hate the clients. I don't like the website's interface, I hate the Android app. But yeah, I'll deal with it cause it's cheap, I guess. Carson Saldanha Got it! Yay! Jim I wish I could somehow get it on my Amazon Echo hahaha. I guess if I had paid for a Google Home it would be worth trying out. Forget vega #getEVGA Why google play music isn't available in my country ? Ailín Ó’S Try Apple Music? They seem to be just about everywhere. Iamsecond And this is why Apple continue to dominate, because Apple are truly interested in being an international company whereas Google is just playing at it. Such a shame xyz Because Google sucks. Bartek Juszczak My GPM radio's are so good these days I love that Google is so into AI. Whether It's just "I'm being lucky" or radio from a specific song, band or album they very rarely disappoint me these days. I just make sure to thumbs up if it plays a song I particularly love. I am a student and could go cheaper with spotify but the AI generated playlists have me locked in. If it's £5 cheaper but I'm not gonna enjoy it nearly as much then it's not really a good deal. AndTheWorldMayNeverKnow I used the 3 or 4 months free trial during the holidays then bought the family plan for $14.99 a month. 4 people in my family us it and it works great, the app could use some tweaks but it's really good overall. paev If you listen to main stream music it doesn't really matter what service to use. However, if you like something unusual, weird or other languages then Google is a way to go. I found bands on Google music that Spotify displayed as not found. Google also have new synth bands that Spotify doesn't. I'm for Google too. Daniel I discovered that GPM is kinda like a music label. I once went to a section of Google play explaining how indie artists can use GPM like a music label as long as they own all their rights. Ryne Hager Ultraista (among others) keeps me using Google Play Music as well as Spotify. Carson Saldanha Does anyone else who activated the Play Music trial have YouTube Red working as well? My YT Red doesn't seem to be enabled while my Play Music is. Michael Carr I spotted a similar offer a couple of months ago, and I took it after a day or two's thought. Just last week, I moved directly into a family plan. PewPewYoureDead It's hard to recommend Google Play Music until they revamp the UI. Margaritas Ante Porcos Google Music is the only choice in some markets, like Russia, where no Spotify or Pandora are available. There are too many shortcomings in Google Music and Google never shows interest in making services better than below average. I really wonder why Google refuses to become the best at anything. Real magic here. Pixel syndrome all the way. Yet Google Music is on my phone and I use it because there's no choice whatsoever. Rob You answered your own question. If there's no alternative, then they don't have any incentive to improve the service. SupahNin10doh Stupid Dorito logo... Raymond Berger Huh, I just subscribed to the trial but you youtube red hasn't kicked in yet. Any idea how long it takes? Iamsecond If you live in the UK, about 2 years so far h20ray Google Play Music is currently available in select territories and for select account types. Umang Ladia I'm only seeing 2 months offer in India, anybody can confirm? Mohammad Ovais Yeah, same for me. Maybe it's region limited. Isolde I think you need to open the link in a browser, if you open it in the app it's just the normal 2 months. bligui Confirmed need to open it from link and it works Manoj | Blogging Triggers Is Google Music really worth to it? We have better alternatives Sathiya Moorthy Karan I came across a great post, it seems to be so cool http://developeit.net/android-news-image-scanner-finder/ Zachariah Mann It only shows up as 2 free months for me. I live in Michigan. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a19b7e9dddb67bf897c751aedf63c01917048214140db901fd783b2182d8d5c0.png Jefferson Rodrigues https://play.google.com/music/listen?coupon=120DFREE&coupontype=vanity#/sulp Zachariah Mann That link still brought me to the same page on the Play Music App which offers 2 months free. Does it matter if I'm opening it on a computer or web page? Jefferson Rodrigues I don't know. Mikael Jakobsson Should mabye joine premium at Google Music if that coste like $2 max a month dont understand why they should take as mutch as someone some has app or Win32 software to PC so music controllers one they keyboards works. Tab out frome a game for pause music when the round is over is just bad. Arif Gürü And stil isnt available on Turkey xyz "No telling how long this offer might last, so if you have been considering subscribing, now might be the time to do it." No thanks, I'll just use YouTube. Only thing YT needs is an option to play audio only so I can save a wee bit more data when I don't need video. Cai Copley Nope. If it wasn't for the fact work pays for Spotify Premium and the fact Spotify has Crossfade to emulate a DJ system, maybe I'd give it a whirl. bligui Not working any more to bad Follow Android Police 1.49M 472k 145k 119k Latest Deals 9 [Deal Alert] Chromecast Ultra is $59.99 ($10 off) at Google Store, Best Buy, B&H and others 2017/06/04 12:16pm PDTJun 4, 2017 13 [Deal Alert] Google Home is $109 ($20 off) at Best Buy, Google Store, B&H, and others 2017/06/04 10:07am PDTJun 4, 2017 12 [Deal Alert] Kick off the weekend with 24 temporarily free and 52 on-sale apps 2017/06/03 6:50pm PDTJun 3, 2017 18 [Deal Alert] Get a Nextbit Robin for $129.99 on eBay 2017/06/03 9:39am PDTJun 3, 2017 33 [Deal Alert] A Stork's Journey is currently free on Google Play Movies & TV 2017/06/01 10:50pm PDTJun 1, 2017 Latest Poll How many photos are on your Google Photos account?

Suggested Sharing is going live in Google Photos for some users Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/25 5:30pm PDTMay 25, 2017 41 Plus 1 on G+ 118 Share on Facebook 77 Share on Twitter Total Shares236 Applications Google News Google Photos is ground zero for the company's crazy machine learning technology. At Google I/O 2017, a number of new features were announced for Photos, including suggested sharing based on who's in a certain photo. But for that to work, Google needs to figure out who is who, and now the Photos web app is asking users to identify what they look like. Upon visiting photos.google.com, you may be welcomed by the above screen. Google already uses machine learning wizardry to match faces to people, so all you have to do is select which face is yours. Once you do that, you'll be able to search for "me" in the Photos search to find pictures of yourself. According to a recent teardown, this option should appear at some point in the Photos app as well, but it didn't for me. Presumably, this will be far more useful once the other features announced at Google I/O show up. Let us know in the comments if you have received the pop-up.

I got the pop up just the other day. I can search for "me" in addition to others such as my daughter's name. John Doe I did but for some reason it shows a photo of me from over 6 years ago even though I have plenty of recent photos LoL Corbin Davenport Yep, my picture was an awful photo of me from several years ago. John Doe I was able to change it by going to people then clicking on the picture and even when you choose a picture with a lot of people in it figures out which one is you and zooms in...creepy bozzykid It doesn't matter what photo you choose of yourself. The rest are all linked to you anyways. This isn't replacing your profile pic. John Doe No but some photos it has not figured out its me or at least when I click on me it doesn't show all the pictures of me but it is good enough to find pictures of me when I was a child which is crazy because I changed a lot. Stakoman Is this US only? would be great if you guys made a "how to enable face recognition google photos" post Suicide_Note Use a US VPN to start using the face recognition. Once you get things setup, you can stop using the VPN, though face recognition should still work. rndusrnm479461 You can use a VPN (get tunnelbear cause it's free) for Android, then clear cache, open photos and enable grouping of faces in the settings. Then you can disable VPN. I did this about a year ago and I've had it ever since without any problem both on Android and on the web. bozzykid I believe it uses one of the firsts photos you have stored. It has already linked the rest to you anyways. Régis Knechtel Not always, apparently, cause it used a recent photo for me. I think it's random. Brendapdaniels Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Defenestratus No. Régis Knechtel "his option should appear at some point in the Photos app as well" It asked to chose my face me today in the android app, while I was setting up a new phone. jcopernicus I accidentally closed the prompt...how to I get it back? Corbin Davenport On the web, go to Settings -> Group similar faces, and there should be an option to pick your face. Yatin No, I'm from India Drakenoid Yes, I'm also from India. Naga Sridhar I am from India too, but are you in India? myssi Pop-up recieved, I'm from Pakistan. Tomáš Petrík And I guess we will be left out in the EU, again :/ Indefinite Implosion I'm in NL and got it a few days ago? A day or two after the announcement maybe (crunch time, so days are a blur). I didn't tip because it doesn't do anything right now so hardly seems worthy of a post. roberto.elena Do you already have "group similar faces" activated? If yes, then you will get this update. Tomáš Petrík No, it is disabled for accounts registered in the EU due to some stupid privacy ruling of the EU. roberto.elena I know, but you can activate it using a VPN (or at least that was possible when they launched Google Photos). Once it's activated, you don't need the VPN anymore, and you get all updates related to face recognition features. Nelson Not correct. I'm in Europe and by using Opera VPN plus Google Photos cache clear the feature appeared Amir Instead of copying and pasting your Debbie Downer response on every single comment, go try it with a VPN. Gosh! Tomáš Petrík I don't know who Debbie Downer is and I posted a similar response only due to the fact that I want to react to multiple people and I want them all to get a notification so that they know somebody replied to their post. Suicide_Note Use a US VPN and you can join the party. Tomáš Petrík It's not about VPN this time. Accounts registered in the EU have facial recognition disabled due to some stupid privacy ruling of the EU. Jens Törnblad That's why you activate the feature with a VPN. Suicide_Note Ah, okay. I wasn't aware of that. Definitely sucks. Mr K Nope. I cleaned data from Google Photos and force closed, activated Tunnelbear (it's free for 500MB but you won't use more than 50) in the US and opened Photos. Configured everything (make sure face recognition" is activated in settings) and everything works fine. I just got the notification in Photos for web about this new feature. And you can of course uninstall the VPN when everything is set up. rndusrnm479461 Get tunnelbear for Android. Choose a US vpn. Clear Google Photos cache -> open it -> enable grouping of faces in the settings. You only have to do this once. I did it a year ago and it has worked ever since on all my devices. Tomáš Petrík It's not about VPN this time, though. Accounts registered in the EU have facial recognition disabled due to some stupid privacy ruling of the EU. rndusrnm479461 Really? I registered mine in EU in ~2008 and activated face grouping in early 2016 without problems. henleyb I got it a day or two ago. Was an old photo but searching for 'me' did bring up correct photos for me so that's something. Looking forward to the sharing stuff next. :) Suicide_Note Haven't seen this popup yet, but on a related note, photo books have gone live for me in the Photos app. Taylor Hardy I work from ease of my residence, with the help of easy jobs that merely usually requires from you a Computer system and even on-line connection and I am also more successful than ever before...

If you're looking to install it on your phone, you can opt-in to the first public beta, which is also available as the second Developer Preview. Supported devices This update is around 919 MB in size, and you can download over a WiFi and the preview is supported on Pixel Pixel XL Pixel C Nexus 6P Nexus 5X Nexus Player How to install If you have any of these devices, head on to Google’s Android Beta Program website. Once you log in with your Google account, it will take you to the page and explains what the program is all about. It also has a usual disclaimer and warning saying “may contain errors and defects that can affect the normal functioning of your device.” Now tap on the enroll button right next to your device and check the box, select Join beta, and you will be in. Once you get a beta for your device, you will get a notification of any other updates. Head on to Settings -> About phone -> System updates. SEE ALSO: How to set up speech-to-text in Android Once you select it, the update will install over-the-air normally, with a reboot, and whenever another update comes, you’ll go through the same process.

A source familiar with Google’s plans says the new program will focus on early-stage startups. Where the new investment seems to differ most from Google’s existing investing groups is that it’s led by engineers, not venture capitalists. Google VP of engineering Anna Patterson, whose focus as an executive is AI, is in charge of the effort, according to Axios. One thing we don’t know about the new program is how strategic its focus is. Will Google be looking to partner with or acquire portfolio companies, or will investing be more focused on returns? Here are a few startups that reflect areas in which Google may be interested in investing: Imagen This New York-based startup has reportedly raised $15 million to apply AI to analysis of medical images for earlier disease detection. That sounds like something up the alley of Google, which has a lot of interest in computer vision, and Google parent company Alphabet at large, which counts two health care subsidiaries in its ranks. Imagen also has a former Googler as VP of engineering, according to LinkedIn. Diffbot Here’s another one in the computer vision area. Diffbot extracts information from websites, which sounds a bit like the “copyless paste” feature expected in the new version of Android, Android O. The company has raised $10 million, according to AngelList. Anodot Anodot automates the detection of outliers in large datasets. This could be a useful for enterprise companies crunching data in the the cloud. Anodot has raised $12.5 million in funding.

What I do love about Apple is its support for third-party keyboards. You can ditch the generic offering and download enough keyboards for every conceivable customisation option you want. Image credit: John Moore/Getty Keep in mind you don't have to commit. Don't be afraid to install more than one keyboard! If I'm looking for some particular animated image I'll use GIPHY Keys more than Gboard, but during normal texting hours or when typing in a note-taking app like Bear, swipe-friendly keyboards are my tool of choice. Gboard (Android, iOS) Google's keyboard (available for iOS and Android) is packed with just enough features to be useful but not too many to be cumbersome or unwieldy. It's been my keyboard of choice since its debut, thanks to its simple search integration: In true Google fashion, you can search from the keyboard itself and send links as well as descriptive cards to recipients. Its responsive swipe functionality is great for popping in and out, while other keyboards I've tried in the past were somewhat sluggish in acknowledging my swiping as spelling. You can pull images and GIFs from Gboard to send or save (though the results sometimes differ between its desktop and Gboard searches). Sure, you can type on it like a traditional keyboard, but Gboard also features glide typing — swiping your finger across letters to spell words — just like Swype and Swiftkey, and it learns from your history to improve its predictive search and text suggestion without transmitting personal data to the company. If you're on a bigger phone, the combination of glide typing and a one-handed typing setting on Gboard is a godsend, and makes texting easier and less stressful on your weak human form. Like talking to your phone? Gboard supports text dictation just like Apple's keyboard. Gboard for Android packs in a few more extra features than its iOS counterpart, including language auto-detection complete with autocorrect and suggested text, as well as live translation. Word Flow (iOS) Unfortunately Word Flow is not yet in the Australian store, but we figured it still deserved a shout out for its unique design. Made by a team in Microsoft's experimental Garage division, Word Flow's easy one-handed use lets me knock some text off even while straphanging. Its standout feature is its curved keyboard mode: The keyboard sits in the corner of your screen and makes it easy for your thumb to reach every letter. You can even glide type while it's curved, and see its suggested text (though the curvature reduces the selection choice list). The built-in web search powered by Bing lets you copy and paste images and GIFs, too. If you're suffering from thumb trouble during your typing sessions or just want to be able to reach your keys without two hands, then this is definitely a keyboard to test. 60 Keyboard Shortcuts For Popular Office Apps (Infographic) Of course, you may not need all 60 of these, but knowing them will make you flexible, fast, and ready to work with whatever tool you're presented with, whether it's a Windows PC, a Mac, an Excel spreadsheet, or a Powerpoint slideshow. Plus, there are extras in here for Gmail and Chrome to boot. Read more Swiftkey (Android, iOS) With SwiftKey, Microsoft now has two different keyboards in Apple's app store. Swiftkey just got a much-needed redesign and with it a more minimal, functional look. It's also more responsive than before, registering swipes quickly enough. It supports swipe typing like Gboard and Word Flow, and custom themes in case you want to add colours to your keycaps. Hooking Swiftkey up to your Facebook or Google account gives it access to your data (it's encrypted before leaving your device, and Swiftkey doesn't have your login information) that it uses to personalise your autocorrect functionality as well as predictive text suggestions. It will even show you how it's adjusting your typing style and how much time you're saving by not tapping away at letters. It also has a few tricks up its sleeve if you're looking to expand your language options — a recent update boosted support to over 100 languages. GIPHY Keys (iOS) I like GIFs. You like GIFs. We all like GIFs. Why not use a GIF-friendly keyboard? In terms of typing, you won't find anything revolutionary here. You'll be tapping away just like before. Giphy Keys isn't as full-featured as Gboard, nor does it feature glide typing functionality like Swype. It's cute, though — and it blows the competition out of the water in terms of GIF search functionality. Giphy is the gold standard of GIF integration across the web, especially since it lets you access the Betaworks company's repository of both pop culture and original GIF content through its slew of categories — or you can search them yourself from the keyboard. WATCH MORE: Tech News & Life Hacks Comments tim @tim May 29, 2017, 10:57am On iOS I haven't really taken advantage of it yet but the westpac keyboard is neat, you can transfer money, send account info, send a cardless withdrawl code from the keyboard (after authentication each time). Although it does lose the ability to use shortcuts (like i use @@, @@@ and @@@@ for my email addresses) but since i dont need to send account info/cash every day i dont neccesarly have to use it as my main keyboard, but its handy to be able to do it from a sms message. Reply 0 chompers @evan May 29, 2017, 1:26pm I use swype on my iphone and ipad. It's the best I've found so far. Unfortunately on iphone it does sometimes go bonkers and freezes. The only workaround (short of restarting the phone) is to go into settings, allow if full access and then turn full access back off. Reply 0 samdell @samdell May 30, 2017, 8:54am Using iOS, I flick from GBoard, Swype and SwiftKey as I love the swype inputs of all three. My preference is GBoard but I sometimes get angry as it has the worst auto correct and despite using it for over a year, never seems to learn. Reply 0 Join the discussion!

How The Promise Of The NBN Fell Short For So Many Australians Tooran Alizadeh 05 Jun 2017 11:15 AM Eight years into the Australian government’s National Broadband Network (NBN) project, the nation has an average internet speed – 50th in the global rankings – that lags well behind many advanced economy countries. Ongoing secrecy around the NBN, a project that’s likely to cost more than A$50 billion, makes it impossible for the public in most cases to know when and what quality service they will receive. Further, new research shows the NBN rollout was politically motivated and socioeconomically biased from the beginning. It is perhaps time to remind ourselves of the ups and downs of the project that was once announced as a dream national infrastructure project for the 21st century. This requires a ten-year journey back in time, before we can figure out what needs to be done next. Want Lifehacker's email newsletter? Subscribe Alert me about competitions & deals Have a tip?

[Update: Now $75 Off] Deal Alert: Pixel 32GB (international version) is $50 off on eBay Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/05/26 2:20pm PDTMay 26, 2017 2 Plus 1 on G+ 53 Share on Facebook 57 Share on Twitter Total Shares112 Deals News Pixel Update 1: 2017/05/26 2:32pm PDT It looks like the price has dropped another $25, making this a $75 savings in total. For a device that hasn't seen much in the way of price drops or It's no secret that Google has had some serious supply issues with its flagship Pixel phone. That goes for pretty much any combination of size, color, or storage. Rumors even began to surface alleging that Google had stopped production of the devices altogether. That wasn't the case, but nonetheless, you will still struggle to actually find the Pixel if you wish to buy it. A 32GB Pixel (international version) on eBay for $50 off the list price could be the answer to that problem. This is the entry level 5" Pixel, with 32GB of storage in the color Very Silver - and it's available for $599. That's $50 less than the $649 Google is still charging for it. Beware though, this is the international version of the device. So if you live in the US you'll have to check the bands to see if it works on your network. This version won't play nice with Verizon or Sprint, so if you're on either of those carriers you can rule this out. If you live outside the US then this is definitely for you. Shipping appears to be free in the US, but here in the UK, it's $18.99. That still works out a bargain for me, especially if you account for the exchange rate. You'll have to do the sums from where you are to see if the deal is as good for you. It's worth mentioning that getting your warranty honored might be tough with this type of purchase, so bear that in mind. It's hard to say how many of these they have, other than a "limited quantity," so you'll have to be quick if you want to get your hands on arguably the best Android phone of 2016. Update 1: 2017/05/26 2:32pm PDT It looks like the price has dropped another $25, making this a $75 savings in total. For a device that hasn't seen much in the way of price drops or sales since launch, $75 off isn't bad. Anyone interested in a Pixel that uses a network compatible with this international model should give it a serious think.

Then I'll get one. shamatuu that will never happen james fuston Looks like we found the one guy still using a Fire Phone. Middlefinger As a back up phone yeah, its not reliable enough to be a daily driver. Its problems seem to be a mixture of hardware bugs, and Googles poor software QC. me me "bargain" JL "buggy" Gladysrcrosby Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job. Even everyone not used to this, can make $89/per h easily and the earnings can go even higher over time... This is how i started !so184c: ➽➽ ➽➽;➽➽ http://GoogleFinancialCashJobs474MarketConsultantGetPaid$97/Hour... ★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫::::::!so184c:....,.... abc "bezel" Master Yates After handling a S8, OMG those Bezels. Max Johnson "blacklisted" Taylor Hardy I work from convenience of my residence, via hassle-free tasks which only needs only from you a Laptop in addition to on-line connection and I am just more successful than ever before... After six months with this work and therefore managed to get paid in total 36 thousand dollars... Mainly I make close to 80 bucks/h and work for 3 to 4 hours time daily.And fantastic point regarding this work is that you can easily arrange time period whenever you get the job done and for how long as you may wish for and you achieve a check each week.----->>>> learn by clicking here how to do it right now Middlefinger Even at $99 its not worth the bugs. It doesnt matter how 'high end' a device is, if it doesn't work properly, its worthless. jonzey231 $50 is worth a guarantee that Google will honor the warranty....trust me...I wish I would've gotten my 6P direct. Andy What do you mean? jonzey231 If you don't buy the phone from Google, they won't help you. They send you to the manufacturer. I was forced to go to Huawei for my 6P and it was a little over 3 weeks before I got it back....and the problem is still there. Spend the extra $50 and buy it through Google so you're guaranteed to get support through their CS channels. You'll be glad you did in 6 months when something inevitably goes wrong. IMHO get the OnePlus 3T. Costs less but has better overall specs aside from the camera which is still pretty good in its own right. My brother has one and my roommate just got his last week and they both have no intention of going back to a major brand ever again. YaKillaCJ Same happened when I got the OnePlus One. It changed the way I (and many others) view a "budget" device from an unknown brand. needa I felt the same way after using an OPO for nearly three years. Got me an XL in mint condition for $450. Google edition even. Still had 3520 mAh in the batt too. Would have bought the black 3T had they been in stock. Took me three days to hunt down this deal. Andy Got my wife the pixel. Runs great. Just had the microphone problem. Google swapped without question. Wife seems to think it takes horrible selfies. Rod Weird, as it's cameras are regarded among the best currently. Random! @andy maybe you should let her know that the camera isn't the problem... It's actually her face. If you do warn her about this, I promise to visit you at the hospital. Andy Thanks for the tip. VAVAMk_2 Huzzah! Master Yates Agreed with you regarding the 3T. Lets see if the excellent updates and support evaporate when the One Plus 5 is released? That's the real test. IcerC Except in this case Google is the Manufacturer, that might change things. VAVAMk_2 Google didn't make the camera. Uses a Sony made sensor but the camera software is Google's and regarded among the best in post processing, particularly HDR. Roy Ahh so nice call me when the 1+2 will get Nougat and your friend will get or never get Android O. ddevito #Fail Andy S8 release response? AdMoc Does not ship to Poland as fck always -_- Random! Look for some service like Shipito. I believe they have an EU warehouse. Shakil Shaikh $60 shipping? kristin ANY Pixel made by google is compatible with any provider. It doesnt matter if its international or not. This writer is an odiot. Scott Scrivens https://www.techwalls.com/google-pixel-pixel-xl-model-number-differences/ Kevin Davis "Odiot", lmao. 😂 Oh, and you're wrong, too. kristin I called google about this. It would be up your phone company provider whether it worked or not. So it may not work with att or tmobile either. kristin This may or may not work on any provider. Its up to the provider. You want a pixel? Go to swappa.com and get one used in mint condition for much cheaper. Ive gotten a few phones from them since ive been on project fi and had no issues. Ill never buy a new phone again. Random! $50 off? How cute... If they get to $300 off ($350 final price) within a month, I might even convince myself it's worth to stare at those bezels everyday. Other than that (impossible) scenario, I'd rather get the 3T, Axon 7, or even the LG G5. Gjorgi Lazarovski The Pixel is probably not dropping in price anytime soon. iKon The most overrated smartphone of 2016. Only the camera is decent. Ugly ass design, overpriced and dull with no features compared to competition Roy You mean the best smartphone of 2016, best camera rare band front, best software, best updates. Great battery, great display. xyz No, he means "The most overrated smartphone of 2016. Only the camera is decent. Ugly ass design, overpriced and dull with no features compared to competition." Roy No, I'm sure he/she means "the best smartphone of 2016, best camera rare band front, best software, best updates. Great battery, great display". iKon No I meant what I said. The pixel is a flop and even Google knows it. No matter how much money they put into advertising there are alot of better choices out there.. only hard core Google fanboys try and big it up Roy Yes yada yada and still every reviewer said is the best smartphone of 2016. So.. even David here. In the on of the day it's a lots about the UI and I just don't like Samsung software. Ordeith LOL. You're such a Google sycophant, Roy. Roy You feeling really smart? I'm Imagine your ass all over your face. nirmitlamed Google is so off track in figuring out what customers wants and competing against the other monstrous companies. I would very much like to hear how many Pixels Google sold in the last year since they told us they sold more than they expected. Lawrence I can put my coffee cup on the Bezel David Nowicki I'm a big Nexus fan, but why would you pay $749 for the Pixel XL vs the OnePlus 3T at about half the price ? And soon the OnePlus 5 at $450 or so with S8+ specs will be a steal compared to the Pixel 4Ui812 Supply and demand. Limit the supply and you increase demand. It's like P.T. Barnum said , "There's a sucker born every minute".

Google is working on a solution to the problem. By Martin Pratt 27 May 2017 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share by email Google updates its Android smartphone operating system every year. Android O is on the horizon, but has your phone even updated to Android N? It takes too long to get updates to Android smartphones and finally Google has a plan to fix that. Google’s answer to the update roadblock is Project Treble, which completely retools the Android architecture making it easier for device manufacturers to update their phones. Just 7.1% of the two billion active Android devices are running Android N, while around 360 million devices are still using Android K, which released in 2013. Project Treble is unlikely to be of any use to anyone still using KitKat, but the changes to the underlying Android architecture could help future phones from HTC, Samsung and LG stay up to date. The chart below shows how the vast majority of Android phone users are on out of date versions. Best Buy smartphones – the best reviewed phones on the market. How does Project Treble work? To understand how Project Treble works it’s good to know why it needs to exist. Manufacturers such as Samsung, LG and HTC use Android in everything from their budget handsets to their flagship ranges. When Google announces a new version of Android the manufacturers begin the long process of adapting it to work with their phones. First off, they need to determine which phones can handle the new OS. The latest phones shouldn’t have any problems, but older, less powerful models may have difficulty running the new features. Our own testing has discovered phones that get worse after an OS update, so slapping a new version of Android onto a manufacturers entire range isn’t a good idea. The sheer amount of time it takes to adapt a new OS to a phone means adding it to older phones just isn’t worth the hassle. Phone manufacturers like to add their own special flavour to the stock Android OS. Samsung has TouchWiz, HTC has Sense, but whichever brand you go for there will be some kind of overlay. It takes time to get these extra features working with new versions of Android. Once the manufacturers have adapted their overlays to work with the new OS there is a period of testing to ensure that there are no problems. Providers like Vodafone and EE run their own tests too, which causes further delays. When the update is finally ready it will be released in selected countries. The staggered push of the update is a final test to see whether the new OS is working. By releasing it to countries with a smaller number of users, the manufacturers and networks can identify any last minute problems before they unleash it onto the millions of smartphones in the UK and America. Being a country of smartphone users we’re too risky for the first wave, but conversely we are a priority once the manufacturers are confident their phones behave themselves after the update. Project Treble aims to cut down how long it takes to roll out updates by separating the Android operating system from the ‘Vendor interface’. This interface handles the mundane, but important, low-level software and drivers. Previously it would be up to device manufacturers to adapt the vendor interface, a laborious process of code rewriting. Project Treble removes this lengthy process, which leaves the manufacturers free to work on the other aspects of the upgrade. We should get quicker updates and manufacturers may be keen on bringing the new software to older handsets in the future now the method is streamlined. When can we expect speedier updates? Here’s the catch to all this good news, only the Google Pixel is compatible with Project Treble, which means the Samsung Galaxy S8, LG G6 and HTC U11 will have the same update woes they’ve always had – bad news if you were looking to upgrade to a shiny new Android handset in 2017. Despite the current crop of state-of-the-art handsets not being compatible, Project Treble is still a step in the right direction to eradicating one of Android most significant issues.

ROS LBoard 1 ‘Developed nation status is about accepting others, even LGBTs’ Nawar Firdaws Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US Technology, the way forward for businesses Nora Jaswa | May 27, 2017 Google Malaysia advises companies to use technology to the fullest to carve out a niche for themselves in the industry. KUALA LUMPUR: Businesses, especially start-ups, should embrace technology in their everyday operations, says Google Malaysia. Communications head Zeffri Yusof said this would help them leverage on opportunities and assist in managing operations. “Technological software, for example, can help smoothen the gathering of data for a company, and this data can be analysed more accurately to give companies an edge in the market,” he said. Zeffri said a company could be a strong industry player when investments in technology were prioritised. “Take Google Maps, for example. We use layers of data using a global information system, or GIS, to create accurate coordinates and give more information about a place,” he said. He added that using data to create visualisations would give a company a wider overview of its operations and expedite decision-making. It will also eventually optimise a company’s operational cost, he said. Google Malaysia emerged first in a recent survey by JobStreet.com of the top 10 companies Malaysians aspire to work for. The survey involved 10,241 Malaysian employees across all position levels. According to the survey, Malaysians prioritise career development opportunities, citing this as the main reason they would want to work with top companies. Using its technology, Google gathers online data on its candidates to determine the best fit. “With the data, Google Malaysia has derived our own formula to find the best candidate and refine our search,” Zeffri said. The US-based tech giant is not the only company that uses technology as its main enabler. Recently, UEM Edgenta, a company providing asset management services to clients around the world, said it has plans for greater use of technology to streamline its three core offerings. Managing director and CEO Azmir Merican said UEM Edgenta would use technology enablers, develop smart solutions and make full use of the company’s centralised monitoring facility (CnC) to gain efficiency across its operations. “This is to reduce redundancies and operational expenditure and further showcase our business expertise in end-to-end services to our current and potential customers,” he said.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Get Android O features on any Android phone right now with this free launcher Jacob Siegal @JacobSiegal May 26th, 2017 at 9:01 PM Share Tweet We’re likely still a few months out from the release of Android 8.0, but we got a glimpse at some of its most interesting new features and additions at Google I/O earlier this month. One of the features that Google showed off during the event was called Notification Dots, which are small dots that appear on apps when you have a notification. You won’t be able to try notification dots until Android O rolls out later this year, but you can add an unofficial version of the feature to your phone right now. Don't Miss: New report reaffirms the iPhone 8’s most exciting new feature This week, the first beta for Nova Launcher 5.2 arrived on Google Play. Along with some minor fixes and performances improvements, the latest update adds customizable notification dots to the launcher. You can decide where on the app icon they will appear and how large they will be. And just like the real dots, Nova Launcher’s notification dots will match the color scheme of the app icon they appear on. It’s not an exact replica of the notification dots that will appear on Android O, but if you want to take a trial run of the new feature, this might be the best way to do so, other than downloading the Android O beta. Unfortunately, the Android beta is only available on certain phones, while Nova is universal. If you want to try out the latest version of the Nova Launcher, just opt in on Google Play and wait for the update to arrive on your phone or manually download the 5.2 beta from APKMirror.

Claims that ABC News siphons readers away from Fairfax publications are unfounded. AAP Image/Joel Carrett Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger Fairfax CEO Greg Hywood has been busy. His company’s announcement on 3 May 2017 that Fairfax would sack 125 of its newsroom staff led to Sydney Morning Herald and The Age journalists going on strike, at the worst possible time in the Australian political calendar. Meanwhile, media reports highlighted Hywood’s annual pay of over A$7 million – which at a median reported salary for journalists of just over A$51,000 would comfortably pay for the most of the staff laid off in Hywood’s announcement. This is not to say that Hywood does not deserve a CEO-level salary, of course. But in light of the criticism of the job losses at Fairfax, his defence of executive pay levels was tin-eared, to say the least: We pride ourselves on providing above-market salaries… We need good people to work at this business. You don’t fix the issues confronting the media business by doing the same thing again and again, and expecting a different result. Yet here we are again, with more journalists sacked, and no clear indication of how this is going to make Fairfax’s news outlets more attractive. Faced with such questioning from the Senate inquiry into public interest journalism, Hywood resorted to a familiar trope for commercial media executives – blame market distortion by the public broadcaster: The ABC is creating additional pressure on commercial media by aggressively competing for the same audience that commercial media rely on by providing online content for free, undermining our ability to create a sustainable model. However, this seems to be fundamentally ignorant of the fact that for years now, the ABC has done what few commercial news outlets have been prepared to do: promote the news stories published by its competitors. Promoting the work of others The ABC has long partnered with Microsoft’s Bing search engine to include a block of links to related content from elsewhere on the web alongside its own stories. This recognises audiences’ interest in seeing multiple independent angles on the same story. Sadly, commercial outlets like the Sydney Morning Herald (SMH) still lack this basic feature and link only to (often virtually identical) stories on their sister sites, such as The Age. Related links in a recent ABC News article - including to Fairfax property Australian Financial Review. Screenshot by Axel Bruns Rather than siphoning eyeballs from its commercial competitors, could ABC News be a driver of traffic to them, then? Traffic data from Hitwise, which tracks Australian users’ web browsing patterns, can provide an answer to this question. First, let us put these sites in perspective. In order to compare like with like, we’ll use the numbers for ABC News here, rather than visits to the main ABC site with its multitude of non-news content. Hitwise data report that the SMH consistently attracts a much larger volume of visits than ABC News. In March 2017, for instance, its 38.2 million total visits constitute about a quarter more than ABC News’ 29.9 million. The Age receives around 27.5 million total visits over the same period. Neither can compete with undisputed market leader news.com.au, with 72.8 million total visits that month. Put together, visits to these two Fairfax properties are already more than twice as large as those to ABC News, then – if the ABC is undermining Fairfax’s market position, it’s not making a very good job of it. Traffic patterns But this is not a zero-sum game, of course. Visitors to ABC News, aided by its helpful links to external content, may well find themselves heading to the Fairfax outlets for more information. Even in the absence of outbound links from Fairfax, the same might be true in reverse, too. Here, the upstream websites recorded by Hitwise – that is, the sites visited just before coming to the SMH or ABC News – tell an interesting story. The SMH receives the vast plurality of its inbound reader traffic from Google sites: some 38.9% of its traffic enter via Google Australia, Google (international), Google News Australia, or Gmail. Another 7.8% arrive via Facebook or Twitter. Similar patterns hold for other sites: in March, The Age receives 28.2% of its traffic from Google sites, and 9.2% from Facebook or Twitter. For ABC News, those percentages are 26.9% and 7.9%, respectively. news.com.au gets 32.2% of its traffic from Google sites, and 7.9% from social media. ABC News’ outbound links are necessarily a much smaller factor than the connections provided by these internet giants, but should not be ignored. In March, 2.1% of the SMH’s traffic began with readers coming in from ABC sites. For The Age, the percentage is even greater: 2.9% of its traffic originated from ABC sites. But the ABC does not play favourites amongst the commercial sites: 2.2% of news.com.au traffic arrived from here. Such public service is hardly reciprocated, however: only 0.9% of ABC News’ already lower volume of traffic originated from the two Fairfax sites. Empty corporate rhetoric There are deeper traffic patterns that the Hitwise data cannot reveal. What we see here are only the sites visited immediately before – not pages opened independently in another user session, or arrived at through a more circuitous route. And yes, as quality news publications ABC News and the two Fairfax sites do operate in the same market segment, of course. But Hywood’s, and other media executives’, statements continue to assume that online audiences make a conscious binary choice between one outlet and another, and that public service media therefore distort the market. This fails to understand how serendipitous our news discovery has become in an age of search and social recommendations. It also fails to recognise that serious news followers – the core audience for these sites – will often read multiple stories on the same events, from multiple outlets. Not least perhaps because they know that understaffed newsrooms now regularly struggle to cover major issues in sufficient detail. The traffic patterns we have seen here, at any rate, reveal that audiences lost to ABC News should be the least of Greg Hywood’s worries. The major Fairfax sites consistently outperform the ABC in terms of reader traffic, and the public broadcaster is even a net source of visits to the SMH and The Age. Similarly, when Hywood calls for “a level playing field which allows local media to take the necessary steps to compete with Google and Facebook”, he fails to recognise that these platforms are the single greatest source of traffic to Fairfax’s sites. Fairfax, and other news sites, are not competing with Google and Facebook: for better or worse, they fundamentally rely on them for visibility and visitors. Media businesses that cannot adjust to this fact are doomed to struggle. Data on Australian Internet users’ news browsing patterns are provided courtesy of Hitwise.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « The Case about the Downing of an Air Egypt Flight related to Apple Devices is still ongoing with Apple not Involved | Main | Apple Opened their First Singapore Store Today with 237 Staff and Angela Ahrendts Greeting Happy Customers » May 26, 2017 Apple's advances in AI Continue to Surface at a Record Pace as news of a 'Neural Engine' Chip now Emerges   Even though Apple was the first major tech company to adopt a digital assistant for use in their smartphone natively, progress on this front seemed to be at a snails pace. Then out of nowhere Amazon shocked the market with a smarter digital assistant on a home device called Echo. Google Home rapidly followed and their latest upgrade will offer free phone calls within the U.S. and Canada and deeper connectivity to Android. Now Microsoft, Harman Kardon and many tech companies are jumping on the bandwagon with new smart home digital assistant based devices aimed to land on the market this fall.   Even Samsung has technically jumped into the market with Bixby in the last month on their Galaxy S8 that they promise will be integrated into future devices and appliances as part of their IoT roadmap. In fact a new design patent that surfaced on May 16 shows us that they have an advanced Echo-like device with a full flexible display on the drawing board that could run Android as their patent figures suggest below.   We noted in a report back on May 11 that the AI Wars were almost reaching Fever Pitch levels. Almost ever week if not every day there's an AI story surfacing. On May 14 Apple aquired their third major AI company in three years. On the same day we posted a patent report titled "Apple has designed a new Siri Architecture allowing Two Digital Assistants to Communicate with Each Other." Last month we posted a patent report tiled "Apple Patent Reveals a Visual System to Assist Siri in Future Devices to understand Gestures, Activities, & More"   At the top of this month we posted a report titled "Inventec Lands First Order for Apple's Echo-Like Home Device with Siri." Although it's a supply chain rumor, Apple fans hope that this could be a big moment at Apple's WWDC in June. Some believe it will launch this fall. Yet what matters is that Apple brings a new Siri based device into the home to support their Smart Home project and to keep the competition at bay.   Google is crafting the argument that they are the one's to beat in AI without question. Patently Apple covered Google's vision in two reports titled "The Vision of Artificial Intelligence According to the Gospel of Google" and "The Google Manifesto: The Arrival of the AI Revolution."   Apple supplier TSMC sees some of the sand beginning to shift into new directions. Co-CEO Mark Liu.Mobile let if be known last month that while smartphones will still drive the market for them in the short term, that new and innovative features for smartphones and other mobile devices including virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), context-aware computation, and artificial intelligence (AI) and deep machine learning require support of more powerful computing technology." Translation: new chips are on their roadmap to power new technologies and features like VR/AR and AI.   The hint of new advanced chips coming to market gave way this afternoon to a new report by Bloomberg claiming that "Apple is working on a processor devoted specifically to AI-related tasks, according to a person familiar with the matter. The chip, known internally as the Apple Neural Engine, would improve the way the company's devices handle tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence -- such as facial recognition and speech recognition." So now the chip will have a name.   The timing of this latest leak about the Apple Neural Engine may have been timed perfectly to start cranking up their developers and fans for the WWDC keynote on June fifth.   The news of advances to Siri in the works have been mounting so fiercely in the last few months that it's now time for Team Apple to knock one out of the park and set their developers on fire for the next phase of Apple AI.   On the flip-side, it's always best to not get over-hyped about anything Apple until it actually unfolds. We know positive things are in the works and they'll roll out whenever Apple is ready to unleash them. But I have to admit, I'm definitely pumped-up for next month's event – are you?   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Google is now offering four free months of Google Play Music for new subscribers Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/26 2:17pm PDTMay 26, 2017 82 Plus 1 on G+ 614 Share on Facebook 102 Share on Twitter Total Shares798 Google News Right now it looks like Google is running a special offer for Google Play Music. New subscribers that sign up here can get four free months of service instead of the usual three. No telling how long this offer might last, so if you have been considering subscribing, now might be the time to do it. It could save you an extra $10. Again, this particular offer is only for new subscribers. I've been a fan of Play Music for a long time, though the device removal limit does get in the way when you switch between devices and ROMs as often as I do. Being able to mix your own library with those of a service also comes in handy. That way I can continue to support artists I am passionate about, without eschewing the larger selection of a subscription offering for the purposes of content discovery, all while being able to fill the gaps in that library. There are a lot of different music services out there, but if you're interested combining your curated library with music available via a subscription, then your options are limited. Spotify does allow you to play back locally stored files, which is convenient, but it isn't quite the same. Amazon also allows you to upload your music for playback via Amazon Music, and with Amazon Prime membership, you get a small library of streaming music to go along with that. For $10 a month ($8 for Prime members) you can access their full library as well. But, Google Play Music has a great interface and plugs nicely into all the other Google services we love. Maybe with this new offer, it's time you gave Google Play Music a chance? After all, even if it doesn't end up working out, you still got four free months of music out of the deal.

Carson Saldanha Wait, wdym 3 different countries? Did you share it with others or something? Ailín Ó’S I live in Ireland, so that's my main account. I have a secondary account based in England as part of a mail forwarder service I use, and my bf is Greek so I had him check the code on his account :) Carson Saldanha Oh wow! Carson Saldanha Hey, since I know it worked for you, are you able to use YouTube Red along with this Play Music free trial? Because my YT Red doesn't seem to be enabled for me. Ailín Ó’S No, unfortunately not as I live in the EU and YouTube Red is only available in USA. Carson Saldanha Weird, I'm in the US though. Ailín Ó’S Ooh that is odd. Sign out of the app then sign back in maybe? Carson Saldanha No luck :( I'm in contact with Google support atm Hopefully they can sort this out Mike Worth it alone for Youtube Red MisterAlex Sweet, I wasn't sure if that was included. Thanks. Should mention that in the main blog post. Ben Still no student membership >:( Ailín Ó’S Spotify is a great alternative @€$£5/month. Ben I know that's what I use just because it's half the price. Ailín Ó’S In Ireland Vodafone have a partnership with Spotify whereby it costs €5 standard instead of €10 regardless of if you're a student or not, they even bundle it with some of their plans. Vodafone do the same in some other countries they operate in (not all). Maybe see if any network in your country has a partnership like that? Worth a shot! Ben Oh yeah I'm on EE in the UK and I've got Apple Music for free for 6 months but like iTunes is a massive stinking turd. Ailín Ó’S I'd rather go back to the days of getting music via Bluetooth from friends than use crApple Music 😂😂 Rahul Krishna In india, we have play music for 1.4 usd/month Umang Ladia I'm only seeing 2 months offer in India.?? Rahul Krishna Well I subscribed to it when it launched here (about 2 months ago), so I can't confirm that. But at this price, there is nothing to be disappointed about. aRvInD I wish Spotify launches soon here. I can't keep using that patched version here...!! Rahul Krishna Me too xyz As it should be, you can't charge European or American prices in India. Rahul Krishna Yes true. There are lots​ of people here with a very cheap Android phone. They cannot pay much money. Julian Coronado That's actually what's keeping me away from Play Music. I've used my free months and I loved the Youtube Red too. But as a student, Spotify for $5 / month is too great to pass up on. Emiliejmosley Google is paying 97$ per hour! Work for few hours & have longer with friends and family! !sm141c: On tuesday I got a great new Land Rover Range Rover from having earned $8752 this last four weeks.. Its the most-financialy rewarding I've had..

Cakefish Spotify ftw ToniCipriani ✓pǝᴉɟᴉɹǝʌ I don't think this is a new offer, got this a while back. In fact my 4 months is expiring next week. Prefer Spotify over it. Song selection a tad bit weaker, and for foreign songs it tries to translate the song names to English and makes it hard to look up. folkrav I like it, it's way cheaper than Spotify for me - my mother, my sister, my wife and myself each pay 30$ a year and we're set - but Jesus do I hate the clients. I don't like the website's interface, I hate the Android app. But yeah, I'll deal with it cause it's cheap, I guess. Carson Saldanha Got it! Yay! Jim I wish I could somehow get it on my Amazon Echo hahaha. I guess if I had paid for a Google Home it would be worth trying out. Forget vega #getEVGA Why google play music isn't available in my country ? Ailín Ó’S Try Apple Music? They seem to be just about everywhere. Iamsecond And this is why Apple continue to dominate, because Apple are truly interested in being an international company whereas Google is just playing at it. Such a shame xyz Because Google sucks. Bartek Juszczak My GPM radio's are so good these days I love that Google is so into AI. Whether It's just "I'm being lucky" or radio from a specific song, band or album they very rarely disappoint me these days. I just make sure to thumbs up if it plays a song I particularly love. I am a student and could go cheaper with spotify but the AI generated playlists have me locked in. If it's £5 cheaper but I'm not gonna enjoy it nearly as much then it's not really a good deal. AndTheWorldMayNeverKnow I used the 3 or 4 months free trial during the holidays then bought the family plan for $14.99 a month. 4 people in my family us it and it works great, the app could use some tweaks but it's really good overall. paev If you listen to main stream music it doesn't really matter what service to use. However, if you like something unusual, weird or other languages then Google is a way to go. I found bands on Google music that Spotify displayed as not found. Google also have new synth bands that Spotify doesn't. I'm for Google too. Daniel I discovered that GPM is kinda like a music label. I once went to a section of Google play explaining how indie artists can use GPM like a music label as long as they own all their rights. Ryne Hager Ultraista (among others) keeps me using Google Play Music as well as Spotify. Carson Saldanha Does anyone else who activated the Play Music trial have YouTube Red working as well? My YT Red doesn't seem to be enabled while my Play Music is. Michael Carr I spotted a similar offer a couple of months ago, and I took it after a day or two's thought. Just last week, I moved directly into a family plan. PewPewYoureDead It's hard to recommend Google Play Music until they revamp the UI. Margaritas Ante Porcos Google Music is the only choice in some markets, like Russia, where no Spotify or Pandora are available. There are too many shortcomings in Google Music and Google never shows interest in making services better than below average. I really wonder why Google refuses to become the best at anything. Real magic here. Pixel syndrome all the way. Yet Google Music is on my phone and I use it because there's no choice whatsoever. Rob You answered your own question. If there's no alternative, then they don't have any incentive to improve the service. SupahNin10doh Stupid Dorito logo... Raymond Berger Huh, I just subscribed to the trial but you youtube red hasn't kicked in yet. Any idea how long it takes? Iamsecond If you live in the UK, about 2 years so far h20ray Google Play Music is currently available in select territories and for select account types. Umang Ladia I'm only seeing 2 months offer in India, anybody can confirm? Mohammad Ovais Yeah, same for me. Maybe it's region limited. Isolde I think you need to open the link in a browser, if you open it in the app it's just the normal 2 months. bligui Confirmed need to open it from link and it works Manoj | Blogging Triggers Is Google Music really worth to it? We have better alternatives Sathiya Moorthy Karan I came across a great post, it seems to be so cool http://developeit.net/android-news-image-scanner-finder/ Zachariah Mann It only shows up as 2 free months for me. I live in Michigan. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a19b7e9dddb67bf897c751aedf63c01917048214140db901fd783b2182d8d5c0.png Jefferson Rodrigues https://play.google.com/music/listen?coupon=120DFREE&coupontype=vanity#/sulp Zachariah Mann That link still brought me to the same page on the Play Music App which offers 2 months free. Does it matter if I'm opening it on a computer or web page? Jefferson Rodrigues I don't know. Mikael Jakobsson Should mabye joine premium at Google Music if that coste like $2 max a month dont understand why they should take as mutch as someone some has app or Win32 software to PC so music controllers one they keyboards works. Tab out frome a game for pause music when the round is over is just bad. Arif Gürü And stil isnt available on Turkey xyz "No telling how long this offer might last, so if you have been considering subscribing, now might be the time to do it." No thanks, I'll just use YouTube. Only thing YT needs is an option to play audio only so I can save a wee bit more data when I don't need video. Cai Copley Nope. If it wasn't for the fact work pays for Spotify Premium and the fact Spotify has Crossfade to emulate a DJ system, maybe I'd give it a whirl. bligui Not working any more to bad Follow Android Police 1.49M 472k 145k 119k Latest Deals 9 [Deal Alert] Chromecast Ultra is $59.99 ($10 off) at Google Store, Best Buy, B&H and others 2017/06/04 12:16pm PDTJun 4, 2017 13 [Deal Alert] Google Home is $109 ($20 off) at Best Buy, Google Store, B&H, and others 2017/06/04 10:07am PDTJun 4, 2017 12 [Deal Alert] Kick off the weekend with 24 temporarily free and 52 on-sale apps 2017/06/03 6:50pm PDTJun 3, 2017 18 [Deal Alert] Get a Nextbit Robin for $129.99 on eBay 2017/06/03 9:39am PDTJun 3, 2017 33 [Deal Alert] A Stork's Journey is currently free on Google Play Movies & TV 2017/06/01 10:50pm PDTJun 1, 2017 Latest Poll How many photos are on your Google Photos account?

Reuters/Eric Gaillard Google has announced a new system that can track credit card purchases made offline. The tech giant, which can already track online shopping, declared that it will launch a tool designed to monitor how much money people spend in merchants’ brick-and-mortar stores. The combined ad clicks of individuals  logged into Google services will be matched to perform the analysis. Ponemon Institute privacy research firm chairman Larry Ponemon said that aggregated data can be translated to data that can identify users. Google’s senior vice president of ads and commerce Sridhar Ramaswamy assured that “incredibly smart people” were consulted in creating the system, which he described it as “secure and privacy safe.” The internet company said it has access to around 70 percent of US credit and debit card sales via its partnerships with companies that monitor data. It is unclear how much access Google has to Australians’ credit card details. It clarified it would not be able to examine specific items people are purchasing or how much a specific individual spends. What Google can do is automatically alert merchants when their digital ads convert into sales at a brick-and-mortar store. Previously, an advertiser may conclude that an ad is a waste of money when people click on it without buying. Therefore, the program can possibly influence merchants to further their digital marketing budgets. Ponemon recognised that Google has good intentions but pointed out that companies and governments in the future might not. Miro Copic, a marketing professor at San Diego State University, also expressed concern over the new tracking device’s safety, saying the kinds of data Google collects might be targeted by hackers. “The privacy implications of this are pretty massive, so Google needs to tread very carefully,” news.com.au quotes Copic as saying. Meanwhile, Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, told The Washington Post that what he found fascinating was that while companies become ever more intrusive as far as data collection is concerned, they also become more “secretive.” Google already has the ability to determine what their users like through  searches they make as well as videos they watch. Online advertisements are targeted to those interests. The new program carries tracking into offline stores, with the company explaining that its computers largely depend on login information like email addresses spot people clicking on ads.

Resold Pixel phones originally purchased from Project Fi are having their IMEIs blacklisted Richard Gao Follow View All Posts 2017/05/25 5:30am PDTMay 25, 2017 59 Plus 1 on G+ 150 Share on Facebook 58 Share on Twitter Total Shares267 Google News Pixel Pixel XL Project Fi Back in November, when the Pixel was slowly beginning to ship to customers, there were numerous reports of people getting their Google accounts banned for purchasing Pixel and Pixel XL devices with the intent to resell them. It turns out that this issue hasn't exactly been laid to rest, as it seems that Pixel phones purchased from Project Fi for this purpose are now getting blacklisted via their IMEI numbers. As an overview, people originally bought Pixels from both the Google Store and Project Fi to sell them to a New Hampshire-based reseller. Why New Hampshire, you may ask? There's no sales tax. Both parties here were supposed to make a profit, but Google ended up banning a ton of accounts for a violation of their terms of service.. Considering how important Google is in our lives (Gmail, Google Photos, YouTube, Play Store, etc.), a lot of people were obviously not happy. In the end, Google did restore many of these accounts, but it was obviously enough for a good scare. However, it seems that Google still hasn't completely forgiven people for violating their ToS. Kyle Bennett, the editor-in-chief and founder of the HardOCP website, had his Pixel XL's IMEI blacklisted just yesterday. IMEIs are typically blacklisted by carriers when phones are lost or stolen, but that's clearly not what happened here. Calling T-Mobile didn't do anything, as their staff told him that they could not reverse the blacklisting. His communication with Swappa support was more interesting, though; here's what they told him: "Sorry to hear of the complaints. We have seen a great number of Pixel devices becoming blacklisted the past two days. We are still trying to figure out why this has happened to so many devices. We are working to find out the cause of this widespread issue. It would be best for both of you to keep on top of Google and pressing them for an explanation. In one other case, I saw this morning Google agreed to send the buyer a replacement device so that might be an option to look into. Seller please work with the buyer and Google to see if they can get to the bottom of it." Kyle then contacted Google support, with the first representative claiming that he had simply received a spam message. When he showed a second rep how his IMEI had indeed been blacklisted via Swappa's ESN/IMEI checker (useful tool if you're buying a phone, by the way), he was told that his Pixel XL hadn't been reported as stolen, but that it had been originally purchased through Project Fi. Kyle was also once again told that his phone hadn't really been blacklisted, but a quick rescan of his IMEI in Swappa proved otherwise. His case was escalated to Project Fi's support team, but the customer service rep refused to give him a reference number and told him that he'd receive it via email. After contacting a third representative, Kyle was informed that his phone had indeed been blacklisted, but that Google wasn't responsible for doing so. This lends further credence to the Project Fi explanation, as it's the carrier and not the manufacturer that has the ability to blacklist devices. The situation is still ongoing, but that's all we know for now; we'll update with more information as we get it.

Okay. NeverrKnowsBest You can sell a Project Fi phone. You just buy them in bulk and try to make a profit off Project Fi. Stupid that the customer is being punished for this, though. Green Dog Is it clear that this is one of the phones that was bought in bulk from that retailer? From my reading, it was just a resold phone. I mean obviously, it's not happening to all phones, but the fact that it's still happening is a concern. NeverrKnowsBest The IMEIs are being linked to one particular reseller in New Hampshire. celestre Do you have more information than is present in the article on this? NeverrKnowsBest I'm just going off what the article said. I would love to read more, but I highly doubt they are just flipping the switch on every resold Project Fi phone. That just isn't very plausible, at least to my knowledge. datkidpatrick you misunderstood the article... they referenced a time where a bulk reseller's phones were black listed... but now it is happening to a bunch of random sellers that decided to sell the phone... Richard Gao The bulk reseller's phones weren't blacklisted at that time. It is entirely possible that these are the same phones. datkidpatrick i purchased mine straight from project fi... sold it 3 months ago and the seller told me the other day it was blacklisted... and yes my mistake.. the bulk resellers email's were blocked or something like that... Cael Did you pay off the phone before you sold it? datkidpatrick yes i did... Corey Kinard So they're punishing someone that fully paid for a device from you, who fully owned the device? They're legally allowed to just fully break something they've already sold and have no right to? This is worse than when carriers wouldn't unlock phones... datkidpatrick im still giving google the benefit of doubt that it was a mistake... they just need to fix it PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ You'll easily win in small claims court if you have to refund and take the phone back. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ What kind of financing plan did you have? They were first sold in Oct. 22 2016 and this is only May 2017. I seem to remember 24 month financing or 12 month financing. You paid your phone off three months ago and already had sold it on Swappa for some time? datkidpatrick ya youre allowed to pay it off early... PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Maybe that's what caused the error at Fi in blacklisting by accident. datkidpatrick ya that doesn't make any sense... but it got fixed this morning by google... NeverrKnowsBest I see that now. Thanks for the clarification. In any case, there has to be something in common with these blacklisted phones, I don't think Google/Project Fi would blacklist all second hand phones, I don't think that's very plausible. Corey Kinard Do you really need to think straight when you are in competition for largest company in the world? They probably got algorithms looking for shit and those algorithms mess up. 4Ui812 That's pretty shitty Google. David Bowline Is it really? What's shitty is the people buying in bulk just to make an easy buck and therefore screwing people over. Swappa needs to go after these people. jonzey231 Yeah but if I bought a Pixel LAST YEAR and wanted to sell it no in preparation for the next Pixel or the OP5, for example, my customer may get screwed even though it was just an innocent buy and resell. Max Uh? That's not what happened here... so far this situation seems to be the result of a reseller elaborate plan to evade tax and sell the scarce phone for a bigger profit. This wasn't an individual reselling his/her own phone. jonzey231 Uh? I know that it was originally caused by the douche bags in NJ, but now it's affecting regular people. David Bowline No they won't. I'll bet you can call Google and set it up at the time. Use your noggin and quit jumping to conclusions before the fact. jonzey231 But you saying that is also jumping to conclusions, just on the other side of the argument. If you want to argue me, call Google and play it out. Report your findings here. Otherwise, your words mean no more or less than mine. 4Ui812 That's called capitalism. No one is forcing you to buy it. What Google needs to do is fix all the reported issues with that shitty phone. As for the limited supply of said phone , again that's Google's fault (hell , I wouldn't be surprised if Google intentionally limted the supply ... That's a play out of nintys handbook) Duder12 I have a pixel. There is nothing wrong with my phone. I love it. SirCanealot But I have a Pixel and it is broken. Surely this is not possible to exist in reality? :O :O :O David Bowline If Google is selling phones to a specific customer, who then turns around and sells them en masse, how is Google to know what was sold legally and what was stolen? Google has every right to blacklist those phones. Nobody forced anyone to buy a phone from some jerk on swappa. Its the responsibility of the middle man seller to take care of the problem, not Google. This isn't rocket science here. 4Ui812 You're right , it's not rocket science. If the phone is reported as stolen then it's ok to black list the IMEI. This story makes no mention of phones being stolen. Therefore like I said.... That's pretty shitty Google. A Person It may suck, but who is to decide how my money is spent? kbbl Caveat emptor. SeanPR11 Or.... don't buy your phone from a New Jersey Douchebag. If people don't buy from them, they will stop doing this bullshit. It sucks that regular people are caught in the middle (which happens all too often). It seems Swappa should have known these phones were out there (given the business they are in) and flagged them with the IMEI checker. Alex Excuse them for doing whatever they like with a product they purchased. Pfff David Bowline Then Google can assume that they were stolen and blacklist them. It's not Googles fault here. JFC. SeanPR11 Amen. Ryan from GroupTweet Yes, its shitty. If anything Google should go after the reseller, not the innocent legitimate customers that bought the devices and who are now punished because their phones are blacklisted. Alexander Z Great Swappa can't GO after anyone. Maybe suspend/revoke their account but that's it. My trusted seller hasn't been any help at all with the blacklisted pixel I bought. It's so messed up!! T4rd Saw the site/forum owner of a site I frequent get hit with this on his Pixel this week too. Crazy how the Pixel is being plagued with all sorts of extraneous issues. They can't stay in stock, forcing people to buy second hand, then they get black listed because of some weird policy Google has with Project Fi phones. Max Well being out of stock has nothing strange coming from a Google phone, that's been their main issue for a few years now (Nexus), and it happens even to Apple on launch but the difference is that they're a lot better ramping up production afterwards. This blacklisting is really weird, but so far it seems to be potentially related to a shady reseller so we'll have to wait and see if we get more clarification soon. Geoff Johnson As someone from New Hampshire, it's weird to see my state in an AP article, since nothing interesting ever happens here lol. This sucks though because buyers who bought their Pixel 2nd hand months ago now suddenly might get it blacklisted? J.J. Holy f. That is terrible. So random guy buys a second hand pixel (because Google was out of stock) later gets blacklisted by Google/fi. Gets no help from Google. Never buys a Google phone again. Real smart. Green Dog This on top of the seeming shaky quality of the phones may force me to an iPhone. J.J. I feel ya there but, i just can't do the iPhone thing. Loving this s8+ right now. Duder12 When consumers say this its just sad. Why when you have a difficult time with one android manufacturer immediately think its all Androids and switch to the iPhone? This is how Apple gets tons of customers. Everyone that had a bad time with Samsung just assumed their only other option was iPhone bc MARKETING. Green Dog Because I don't want to have to deal with OS updates through the carrier or a limited phone in terms of LTE bands, as is common for Android phones? People like other phones and I've played with some of them, but I like the Pixel/Nexus lines. But this does give me pause. blenderboy Well, the only offering that competes with iPhone in the world of android is the pixel phone. Samsung displays(hardware in general) are great but software experience can't be compared with iPhone or pixel. It is just sad that they can't keep up with Apple or Google. Google is trying really hard to reach there. I am still using Android because of the platforms openness. Duder12 Fair enough but you know what I mean. You are an exception but A LOT of consumers act this way. Honestly I bought my Pixel through the Google Store last fall and its been solid. I love it. Google needs to sort out the second hand market but these are growing pains. Hardware is still new to them bc the nexus line had help from the OEMs. Now they dont. marcusmarcus2 His comment does not address all Androids. He is only speaking of this one phone. It could be he was between using phones by Google and iPhones and he choose to go with Google's phone. Now with this situation, he decided to go to his second choice. I'm not defending switching to an iPhone over another manufacturer, just pointing out his statement you criticized did not say what you thought it was saying and you were the one to actually apply his statement to all Androids. Just playing the devil's advocate here Alex Because when you pay 7-8-900€ (the price of an iPhone) on an Android phone you expect it to be flawless. And that's normal! However, in real life, regardless if you pay 300 or 800€, Android remains Android, with its notoriously inconsistent battery life, inexplicable wakelocks, unfixed bugs (don't get me stored on the "low priority" bugs with thousands of stars), 2 year updates, etc, etc. tekfr33kn That seems a little dramatic considering that iPhones are far from flawless. You also pay that amount for your average laptop and they aren't flawless. It seems you, or someone else, is holding Android phones to an unrealistic standard. Alex Please don't compare a laptop with an Android phone. It makes absolutely no sense. Isn't it rather that manufacturers (Google being the first of them) increase the prices each year to hallucinating levels with little to no innovation or improvement in user experience. Take the S8 line. Beautiful phones, remarkable design, but a fraction of the cost you pay goes to that crap Bixby that nobody wants tekfr33kn I'll agree with you that Google is artificially raising the price far beyond what it should be but that's basic capitalism and market forces. If the market doesn't want those kinds of prices or can't support it, it won't sell. The issue is that people are actually willing to pay that. iPhones are the primary example. There's about $400 - $500 worth of stuff put in a phone that goes for $800 - $1000 and they still sell like hotcakes. I also agree with you about the S8's and Bixby but again, the market says that the S8 is a hot seller and so Samsung isn't about to change that trend. That kind of makes your argument moot. As for comparing a smartphone to a laptop - if you can't see the comparisons, it's either willful ignorance or you just don't know a thing about electronic devices (specifically smartphones or laptops). In either case, I can't help you with that. The fact is that they share more in common that differences. It's one of the many reasons that development strategies (hardware and software) often translate quite well between them. xyz Uhm, because the phone in question is the overpriced Google phone that is intended to compete with the iPhone and which Google fanboys insist is the greatest Android phone of all time. psychic99 It costs about the same to make a Pixel XL as it does an iphone 7, so why would you expect Google to make less margin than Apple? I will say their ecosystem and support SUCKs compared to Apple, so yeah it should be hundred less because the lifecycle experience of a Pixel will be much worse than Apple and the fact that they artificially end support after 2 years is atrocious. I have 4+ year old Nexus that operate just fine on custom ROMs. And BTW I don't think it is worth it either and happily keep my Nexus 6p for less than 50% the cost. I can't rationalize the price they are asking. Google's support is not consistent. Either they will go over the top to help, or tell you go away you are screwed, There is nothing in the middle, and until you engage them you have no idea if you are going to get help or the hand. Yet another reason they should be hundreds less. Merrill Sampson Just FYI, Google announced at IO a few days ago that they're extending the support cycle on the Pixel from 2 year to 5. marcusmarcus2 Do you have a source for that? https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/4457705?hl=en#nexus_devices Android Version updates: October 2018 Security updates: October 2019 Duder12 Dont forget that apple blocked iPhones that had their fingerprint sensor replaced. Also, dont forget Apple is trying to get a bill banned that will allow consumers to have 3rd parties fix phones. PS: My Pixel is fucking awesome. NexusKoolaid "Dont forget that apple blocked iPhones that had their fingerprint sensor replaced." And this in and of itself was a good thing. With the sensor and the CPU being paired, the sudden appearance of a new sensor having a new signature was deemed to be a security breach. I'm not standing up for Apple here, just calling a spade a spade. And I don't know what information Apple could have shared with 3rd party repair houses (if they were inclined to play nice with them) without compromising security. "PS: My Pixel is fucking awesome." I wish I had one. But they were so hard to get hold of for so long that at this point I'll hang on to my 6P until the Pixel2 is out. psychic99 On Android if you reinstall the O/S or make major modifications they simply invalidate the fingerprint then you have to enter the password manually as a failback. Then you can enrol your fingerprint again. In fact every few days you have to manually enter your pin on N to get into the phone. Sounds like a reasonable method, rather than locking the phone forever. Apple went one step farther. You should go watch youtube... Apple is on a mission to make 3rd party repair a thing of the past. They even specifically make it hard to repair. They want control of the supply chain and dispose of equipment as fast as possible. NexusKoolaid On your first point, there is little control over hardware used to support the platform, so core design decisions are prone to fall back to a software solution. Apple on the other hand has tight control of their hardware and have the option for hardware based solutions, whatever the motivation might be, such as better security or to maintain control of their platform (probably a mix on the two). On your second point, I've read the headlines and seen videos on Youtube (like Louis Rossman). Yeah - their crusade against 3rd party repair sickens me to no small degree. Not just because it would prevent me from seeking out more economical and timely repair of my phone (if I had an iPhone), but because this type of precedent could trickle down to other things I might want to tinker with. Jay Hate to say it but that is the risk people run when you don't buy your devices brand new. J.J. True. But they exasperate said risk artificially for the perceived end goal.... More Profit. The truth is they are doing the exact opposite. This news definitely makes me pause on buying a pixel at all. The Second hand market is real and if i have a bad experience do to Google on a second hand device i will probably not buy new from them when i have the funds. james fuston If you (or the person who sells you a phone) violates the terms of service, you're gonna have a bad time regardless of manufacturer. blenderboy Real question to ask, did Apple ever had similar issue with many devices? hunter2 Probably not since Apple realizes that the perceived strong resale value is a determining factor for many people. Even people who may have never sold a product second hand gain some comfort from the knowledge that they could potentially recoup a lot of their costs if they ever needed to sell. ericshmerick Do the TOS say you can never ever resell the device? Serious question. ekana_stone No the TOS is that you resell as soon as you bought it, so like if you bought from fi cuz it's cheaper and the resold it a little under asking. It's only those phones that were black listed ericshmerick What defines "as soon as?" 5 minutes after purchase? 1 week? 2.8 months? 3 years? marcusmarcus2 Do we have confirmation that it is only those phones that were black listed? Could they have inadvertently black listed other phones from fi? EarlyMon The TOS say that commercial resale is not allowed and lots of them were resold by a private company in a scheme that tried to avoid sales tax. Chris Pretty sure that the Supreme Court just ruled that after you purchase the item the first time that you are allowed to resell it. EarlyMon Commercial resale, not individual resale, is the issue here - a gray market supplier. Look at the number of complaints from people who expected Google support and didn't think that it mattered that they were buying what they thought were the Google version only to find out that they were Verizon models. That's one of the things that the store I referred to evidently did. Who mail orders a Pixel from a New Hampshire store to save the cost of taxes added when we all know what the only outlets are? Santos Chavez It actually does say that isn't allowed, hence why they initially banned several accounts the first time. It was a breach of their TOS, and it still is. It's likely Project Fi saw these phones as stolen and blacklisted them. james fuston "You may only purchase Devices for your personal use. You may not commercially resell any Device, but you may give the Device as a gift." So if you purchase the device and resell it in New (unopened) condition, yeah. Fi could also pretty easily make the case that if you purchased the phone and turned around to sell it before the expiry of the original installment plan that you had purchased it with the intention of reselling. MisterAlex That's still not a commercial sale. If I go to the store, buy a Nintendo Switch, and immediately list it as a brand new Switch on Craigslist, I'm not a commercial seller. I'm still an individual selling something that's fully within my "first sale" rights to sell. james fuston Yeah, that's true if you're reading the second, and only the second, sentence there. The first one pretty clearly states "You may only purchase Devices for your personal use" MisterAlex If you think that reselling a personally owned item goes beyond the bounds of personal use, you're kidding yourself (and so is anyone who thinks that line of thinking would hold water, legally speaking). First Sale is a very broad consumer protection, my friend. Once you buy something of your own, you can do whatever you want with it, including sell it. (Edit: in the States, anyway.) james fuston Yep! Totally fine for you to sell it. Also totally fine for Google to deactivate your phone when you've done something you agreed not to do at the time of purchase. It's then legally on you to prove that they overstepped. MisterAlex You're clearly not parsing what I'm posting. Selling privately owned property is within the bounds of "personal use." james fuston Seeing as Google specifically included a clause about gifting, I'd venture to say they disagree with you. MisterAlex That's fine. Sony also disagreed that it had done anything wrong by removing Other OS. james fuston Cool! So we agree that whether or not you believe Google's terms of service to be legal, it's entirely on the customer to take action after being penalized for a violation of said terms of service. MisterAlex It's always up to the wronged party to seek litigation against a wrongdoer. james fuston In that case, I have no idea why you started commenting on legality when I was discussing terms of service violations. Rather, I would have no idea why if this weren't the comment section. MisterAlex A TOS is not a legally binding agreement. You defended enforcement of a TOS when that enforcement went contrary to law. That's why I brought up the comparison to Sony's PS3 lawsuit (which it lost). james fuston I'm not discussing whether terms of service are legally binding. I'm discussing whether or not the action being described (selling the phone) violates the ToS. It does. MisterAlex And my counter was to point out that putting something in a TOS doesn't make it hunky-dory. In fact, it's quite possible for a TOS to violate law. As I've illustrated. bekifft This is where America is so great. Even if the TOS is unenforceable by law, it is technologically enforceable, obviously. So they do it anyway, and now the onus is on you the little guy to get the multinational corporation to knock it off. Vape John most likely carrier issues the blacklisting... so project fi is the culprit psychic99 More profit? The sell them $150 below market rates. That is not free. I don't know what is actually going on but I would suspect that the original owner did something wrong or unethical. To be honest Google's systems are weird. I ported out my nexus5x and it took them almost 3 months to Bill me for the remainder. So maybe the original person cancelled their card, played games with DPP, activated it for one day and did it again. And again. xyz Fortunately, you can just buy an iPhone and get top notch support. hunter2 So the answer is to buy everything new and toss the old device in the landfill? Kind of sad to see how people just roll over and let over-reaching companies basically decimate the second hand market so they can increase their profits. Jay Never said that and you know it. I said this is the risk you take.. It's as simple as that. trixnkix637 That's the risk you take for not buying from reputable sources. Buying used has risks. Sucks he found out the hard way. jb0nez But the article says it's not Google, it's the carrier who blacklisted. Whatever that means... hunter2 That makes no sense. The carrier technically blocks that IMEI on their network, but only after another carrier submits it to the blacklist. It would be like if you SWATTED somebody and then said "it was the police who came to your house with guns not me". pfmiller On top of that this seems like an abuse of the blacklisting system. The system is intended to discourage theft, not as a means for companies to get revenge on their customers. psychic99 That's not true. Companies have been blacklisting devices for years if tos wasn't met. I have bought 3 phones through fi and they are heavily discounted. Google doesn't do that for free they expect you to activate them on fi for more than one day. Also if you are buying a phone from an individual and not a dealer you are taking a risk straight up. I have had friend have their phones blacklisted when they have bought phones from people and then they turned around and reported them as stolen. Swappa is a marketplace not a arbitrator. They are facilitating a sale. You guys need to know the difference. PayPal is your friend. hunter2 That's dumb. The whole point of cancellation fees is to re-coup the cost of subsidies if you break the contract. By going a different route, the only people who are getting punished are the people buying these phones. psychic99 Lots of people don't pay them and I have seen numerous accounts where friends have bought phones and have told me they got a "deal of a lifetime" to find their devices blacklisted and guess what they were people who never paid off their termination fees or have sold them then reported them stolen. And as an individual you need to take responsibility, if you purchase anything through a private transaction you should ask for poof of sale, do they own it, have it put in writing, etc. That way if the seller does something illegal then you have a remedy. This doesn't derisk anything tho. This is good education for people, to know where responsibility lies and the risks of buying from an individual versus an established dealer. In the case of Swappa, you should buy via Paypal, so there is a remedy. You can chargeback your loss if this happens within 6 months (I have done this will unethical sellers), so they are not being punished they are being inconvenienced. But that is the RISK you take buying from an individual. hunter2 I know you want to see Google as the good guy here, but within these comments there are accounts from people who bought outright, and months later sold their Pixel's and now months after that sale are being contacted by the seller about the device being blacklisted. bekifft I think you're missing his point. It's not about Google being the good or bad guy, it's that buying something third party is inherently risky and he's right, you should ask for a chain of evidence that proves the device is legit. Maybe I'm also just tired of people claiming they can find things so cheap online, when most of it is scams like this, and just devalues the whole market. hunter2 You need to look through these comments. There are people here who bought their phones directly from Fi and after switching carriers their fully paid off phones have been blacklisted. They were the original owners and these phones were never sold. There are also people here who bought phones, used them for months, and sold them after they were fully paid off. These people are saying that the proper they sold the phones to are now coming back and telling them they're blacklisted. bekifft In that case that is indeed disturbing. I am a Fi subscriber though I bought my phone direct from the Google store. Sounds like someone made a big mistake on the back end. Lance Biddle I bought my phone from Project Fi, and it has become blacklisted after changing to another carrier. Google is definitely the bad guy right now IMO pfmiller Just because other companies have been doing it, doesn't mean that it's not an abuse of the system. It's clearly not what the blacklisting system was intended for. Lance Biddle How about when you buy the phone from Project Fi, decide to switch carriers and the phone you outright own becomes black listed. I cannot connect to the Verizon service I'm paying for. And Verizon cannot do anything about. And Google/Project Fi isn't. I've wasted way too much time on the phone trying to get this resolved. They have told me it could be 2-5+ days to get it fixed. WTF!! Never Google again. Never. J.J. I'm sorry. That sucks hard. ProductFRED Considering the original seller probably isn't going to pay people back, all Google did was fuck over a bunch of legitimate customers. iPhone reselling is also a big issue, especially on new releases, but you don't see Apple doing this. J.J. Agree 💯. Most of these customers involved (who probably have had hardware and software issues already on top​ of this) will never buy a pixel again! Cassidy James Blaede Just for the record, the majority of Pixel users likely never have hardware or software issues. I, my mom, and a couple of my friends have Pixels and haven't had any issues. You probably hear about issues on Reddit a lot because the only reason to visit the Pixel subreddit is to complain. 🙃 Jordan L no issues here too. J.J. Not a redditer lol, but many other sites show the issues(as low as they may be) and if you were on the fence about spending that kind of money, these stories alone may sway many Duder12 Yep. Just like iphone touch disease and early shutdowns. Tr3ple Never had those issues. xyz That's true. I personally don't know anyone who has been murdered. Therefore, no one gets murdered. Cassidy James Blaede I'd wager that the majority of people don't get murdered. 😉 Written Description My Pixel XL has performed flawlessly since its purchase and it's my first Android phone after using every iPhone from the first generation on. Google's AI is better, its cloud storage is infinitely better, and I don't see going back to Apple anytime soon. J.J. I'm glad you have not had issues.... Others however have Duder12 Not me. Corey Kinard 3rd Np. Duder12 Mines been great... atl3630 great here too. Cael Apple is not a "carrier". ProductFRED Neither is Google. They just use other carriers' networks. Either way, that isn't justification for what they're doing. Unless they plan on replacing everyone's Pixel (which looks like a hard no), they fucked over a lot of legitimate customers. I buy my devices off of swappa most of the time. Tell me how I would get this fixed if neither the seller nor Google want to take responsibility. marcusmarcus2 Google is an MVNO. Per https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-mvno-cell-phone-carrier-578673 "An MVNO is a cell phone carrier (such as a prepaid wireless carrier) that typically does not have its own network infrastructure and licensed radio spectrum" Apple is not even an MVNO carrier. drksilenc fi is a carrier... JD With Fi Google is a Carrier. Mitch Gray This just happened to my fiance's phone. I bought it on swappa for her birthday months ago because Google store didn't have any in stock and this morning it is blacklisted. I'm so furious. I have had every Google phone since the Galaxy Nexus and because of this policy I will never buy another phone of theirs. She is now stranded without a phone and has no way of using it for work at the busiest time of the year for her (she is a teacher and it's graduation week). Who do I contact about this? We shouldn't be punished because someone gamed the system. J.J. I feel so bad for you. I hope you get it resolved. This is an atrocity! J.J. Should definitely hassle fi/Google and let them know if they don't resolve you will never buy and tell everyone you know not to buy and so on jibust No, stop don't tell them that, they might not withstand the shock of loosing them. /S T4rd I would contact the seller of the phone and/or Swappa if they're the service you went through. If they're no help somehow, then contact Paypal if that's how you paid for it. Google isn't going to unblacklist the phone regardless of what you say to them. It's virtually impossible for a phone to be unblacklisted once it has happened, so you're going to have to just get a refund and buy another phone. A Person Good luck with that. I am hesitant to ever buy again from Swappa.. and I used to love, love, love them. I purchased a device that was blatantly not as described. I then contacted Swappa and they instructed me that it is now between me and the seller. So I contacted the seller via the sale page and was basically told: "ummmm, nah". datkidpatrick at that point you could have went thru paypal and filed a claim... T4rd That's why you buy from reputable sellers. The few minor issues I've had on there were resolved quickly. atl3630 yes, same here. To date I've never had a swappa problem that didn't get resolved and the people have been very helpful. Don't blame swappa for shitty sellers. Buy from reputable sellers (like me). yankeesusa Swappa only helps communicating. To resolve any issues you must file a PayPal claim. datkidpatrick contact the seller and see if they can contact project fi/google... King_Android Ijs, BBB is an extremely powerful tool in order to get your voice heard from Corporate asap...... Stephen Hicks If the phone is under warranty still, file an RMA claim and state the bluetooth isn't working correctly on the device and that you've already tried factory resetting the phone as well as reconnected all the bluetooth devices with no improvement. Might work? njn There is no warranty for second hand phones. JRock I purchased a bootlooping 6P off eBay for cheap, erasing/flashing firmware had same result, RMA'd to Huawei and they promptly sent me a brand new one. Mark Depending on the credit card you used to buy the phone, you might have an extended warranty that might cover this. atl3630 You can get your money back. Contact the seller through swappa and tell them the issue. They will likely tell you it's been to long, I don't care, etc. If so, then file a PayPal claim. You have six months PayPal protection. Document that the phone no longer works and send it back to the seller with tracking. Then PayPal will refund you money, no matter what the seller says. M3D1T8R But doing this will just end up screwing over the seller. PayPal will simply take the money from their account and refund it to the buyer. So that's not fair to the seller either. PayPal's "seller protection" is a fraud. And their customer service is a total joke. They should be boycotted. atl3630 How does that screw over the seller? The seller screwed himself when he sold the phone. His beef is with ProjectFi, not the buyer. Frankly the buyer shouldn't have to deal with this crap since buyers have no way to determine the history of a phone. The seller sold a phone that stopped working. That's on them. M3D1T8R Because, obviously, the seller doesn't necessarily know the history and every previous owner of every phone. What if it's a phone someone bought previously used. They used it for a while just fine, and resold it. Then this IMEI block thing happened. atl3630 Yeah, that would suck. But still, it's not the buyer's fault. If something happens and somebody gets cheated out of $500+ then you better bet people are going to exercise whatever option they can to recover their money. PayPal protection would do that for them in the first 6 months. ericshmerick So anyone who sells a phone is on the hook for its functionality until the end of time? GTFO of here with that. It's ridiculous and you know it. atl3630 Six months, moron. PayPal protection is 6 months. Like it or not, facts. Stop being a little bitch. Roh_Mish What if the seller had bought directly from google. AP mentioned about the trains but there doesn't appear to to be a link between this and that fraud. Also there are many cases where buyer on PayPal will request a reverse and never return the product, screwing over the seller. And PayPal won't do anything about this. vn33 That really sucks .. .especially to someone near and dear to you. I would be beyond furious! Hope everything works out!! Duder12 Swappa will cover you here. You are fine. Get the ball rolling. Anwar Imraan Lucas To me it seems that the original buyer had reported his credit card lost or stolen and is disputing charges on his card which in terms maybe blacklisting those devices as stolen.. blindexecutioner You do Google the service of endless beta testing their software on a way overpriced phone and they blacklist you. Nice. Lawrence Good, that is what you get for buying the Bezel XL ericshmerick OH YOUUUU!!1 theadamsegal Yet another reason I will not buy a Google device again. Tiberian For the record: Kyle Bennett is the owner and founder of HardOCP, not just a simple writer for the site. ;) Richard Gao Did not know that. Thanks! datkidpatrick this happened by to me as well... i sold my pixel 3 months ago and the buyer just informed me it was blacklisted... i had no clue project fi was doing this and legit thought the buyer was trying to scam me... i contacted project fi support and was advised it was escalated to be removed from the blacklist... i paid off the phone before i sold it... this is definitely a mistake by google/project fi... they should be correcting this soon... Jordan L Can a carrier just randomly blacklist IMEIs?! I guess so. I was reading this thread thinking 'well, people probably just bought a stolen Pixel unknowingly' but your case proves this wrong. Navneet Suresh Shitty move Google ! :/ Jay If this happened to me, I'd just return the phone to the seller, get refunded, and make them have to deal with this. Swappa made a huge fucking deal about refunding buyers after the Note7 debacle and it should be the same thing here. freshprince_87 I hope that Kyle guy reads your comment. This may help him Jay Honestly, Swappa needs to be pushing this harder. I sold my Note7 last year and despite the fact that the buyer could have gone and gotten the refund from T-Mobile themselves, they chose to take Swappa up on their suggestion of getting the refund from me. (Add to this that Swappa said if I didn't agree to the refund, they'd "suggest" the buyer take the issue up with PayPal as the device was not sold as advertised. Seriously..) datkidpatrick it isn't the sellers fault... and its something that can be fixed... Jay I fail to see how this isn't the seller's fault for trying to game the system and make a profit. This sure as hell isn't Google's fault.. so who do you want to blame then? The unsuspecting buyers? datkidpatrick it is googles fault... the point they referred to in november is completely separate from the issue happening now... the issue happening now is many pixel phones that were sold and originated from fi is getting blacklisted... i sold my pixel after paying it of legit and it just got blacklisted... now please tell me how i tried to game the system... Jay For all I know, you could be one of those shady scalpers too who tried to make a profit by gaming the system. The burden of fixing this issue should still lie on the sellers. If someone wants their money back, they have every right to make you do the legwork of figuring out how you'll make your money back. datkidpatrick I contacted project fi for the buyer and it is escalated... again the point is it wasn't my fault... marcusmarcus2 If you are just trying to sell 1 phone that you got and paid for without trying to "game the system" it is not your fault, but it is your responsibility as the seller to try and resolve the issue, which it sounds like you are doing. Who's fault is it? Hard to tell until Google releases a comment about why this is happening. Did they block these by mistake? Then it is Googles fault. Are they doing it to block the bulk buyers that were "gaming the system" and just went over board and blocked some extra phones that were not part of those that gamed the system? Then it would be the fault of Google and those that gamed the system that caused Google to make the choice. hunter2 I wouldn't say it's his responsibility. He's selling a device. If the maker of that device decides to flip a kill switch in 18 months and disable every device out there then why blame him. Google is flipping a kill switch an all kinds of devices (just below there is a comment from a guy who bought and paid for his phone, then later switched carriers and had his originally bought phone killed). Trying to blame middle men here is crazy. marcusmarcus2 I'm not blaming the seller. Please re-read. I said the fault is with Google if they are the ones that decided to black list them. It is the sellers responsibility to try figure out why a device they sold is blacklisted. If they did nothing wrong, then they should be able to get it unblacklisted by working with Google. From the looks of some of the comments on here, it looks like the buyer would not be able to get the device of the black list but the seller should be able to. Again, I'm not blaming the middle man. There is a difference between fault and responsibility. Fault sounds like it is fully on Google. Responsibility goes across everyone though with some having more responsibility. Buyer has some responsibility to report the issue to the seller instead of just reporting it to paypal. Seller has more responsibility than the seller because they would be the one who would be able to work with Google/fi to get it off the black list. Google/fi would have even more responsibility to explain why devices are being blacklisted and getting devices off the black list if they should not be on there. Max As a somewhat frequent seller/buyer on Swappa and Ebay I can say that this is definitely the sellers responsibility to fix the problem or promptly accept a return for a refund otherwise this isn't so different from a bait and switch situation. datkidpatrick how is it a bait and switch if i paid off a phone legit and decided to sell it after... 3 months later it gets blacklisted... this is a mistake by google and its their responsibility to fix... Max If you paid off the phone legit and didn't do anything shady then it wouldn't have been blacklisted and if it was you, as the original buyer, are the one with more authority to contact Google, not the second hand buyer, therefore it's your responsibility to fix it. The buyer with a blacklisted phone has zero reasons to believe that you were truthful in your description even if you were. datkidpatrick well i did contact project fi for the buyer and it is escalated... Max Then you're doing the right thing (taking responsibility) and hopefully this gets resolved quickly by Fi! Although I don't know if they can just un-blacklist a phone? Hopefully they can. ericshmerick If I buy a product from a retail store and 92 days later it has an issue, guess what they will tell me when I show up barking for a refund? Yeah, pound sand kid. That's what they will say. So why do Swappa sellers suddenly have the responsibility to refund forever ala Costco? I get people are pissy at the situation, but the seller isn't responsible for Google's shadyness here. Max We're not talking about "an issue" here because that's what warranties are for, we're talking about a phone reported as lost/stolen after being sold this could potentially mean a fraudster that didn't fully pay the phone or a thief that sold a stolen phone, I doubt any serious retailer would do that... By the way that's what buyer protections are for, Paypal has six months of protection and credit card providers can be very flexible if you explain your case well and you're in the right. If a retailer pull something like this they would never win a chargeback. Max We're not talking about "an issue" here because that's what warranties are for, we're talking about a phone reported as lost/stolen after being sold this could potentially mean a fraudster that didn't fully pay the phone or a thief that sold a stolen phone, I doubt any serious retailer would do that...

If a retailer pull something like this they would never win a charge back and the manufacturer and distributor would never be involved in the original transaction or charge back, it would be up to the retailer to go after the manufacturer or distributor. ericshmerick But nothing shady or illegal is going on here. If I and the original buyer and I use it on project fi for two months, then decide to sell it. How does that suddenly implicate me as being some sort of shady criminal? I would simply be selling a legally purchased piece of hardware that was paid in full. Max Can you please elaborate how the buyer knows that you sold "a legally purchased piece of hardware that was paid in full" if he has a blacklisted phone reported as lost/stolen in the hands? Good luck convincing the buyer, Paypal and a Bank that you're in the right in such a situation... Luxferro If they sold you shady (stolen or not legal) products you'd be dealing with them. tnt These are not devices being bought from an official retailer. There's no need to question the history of a device bought from Costco. Swappa (and Ebay and Craigslist for that matter) are not the same type of market. It's the seller's responsibility to know the history (as much as possible anyway) of the devices they're selling. freshprince_87 I guess it's safer to buy a Verizon Google Pixel instead if you intend on reselling it later. So the future buyer isn't screwed by Google. That is such a ridiculous policy drksilenc have to have a line with verizon to do that though. Wendell Brown Apparently not, this dude says his WERE Verizon phones that were locked.... https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/6d2yse/2_of_my_3_google_pixel_phones_blacklisted_on_the/ Me Google is just shooting themselves in the foot at this point with the Pixel Yan Qin I just sold my Pixel XL and switch to Galaxy S8, I do think I was out of my mind that I actually bought Pixel at full price. Jordan L anyone resell a project fi phone NOT through Swappa and have it blacklisted? maybe ProjectFi blacklisted only Swappa phones(still a strange move if it was on purpose) Jagermeister 2 of my 3 Pixel phones showed up blacklisted 2 days ago. I made a reddit post yesterday of my issue. I though it was part of an insurance fraud scam. https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/6d2yse/2_of_my_3_google_pixel_phones_blacklisted_on_the/ I had originally though our phones were from Verizon not Google Fi. We were happy Pixel customers that are now considering purchasing different phones because Google can report as stolen whenever they feel a Google Fi device was not transferred to a new owner per their TOS. How can any user purchasing a pre-owned or "new" Google Pixel be sure that it isn't a Google Fi device and won't be blacklisted in the future? Max Johnson Note to self, don't buy second hand Google devices. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Note to everyone: Don't buy first hand Google devices. Max Why? Mine works perfectly fine and so far it's the best phone I've ever owned. Dana Yeah, it's fine as long as you don't get it from Project Fi because you can't sell it if you want to upgrade to a new device. Max LOL, what? I simply bought it directly from store.google.com, no issues here and I can provide proof. This is something related to phones sold through Fi. hunter2 Congrats, scroll up one comment and you'll find a guy who's phone is blacklisted despite him being the original owner and being fully paid off. To answer your question of "Why", it's because not everyone is as comfortable gambling with their money as you are. Max 1) It was blacklisted by the carrier, not the manufacturer. 2) It was blacklisted after it was resold, sucks but as far as we know it doesn't affect the original seller, there's a difference there. 3) We don't know yet why this really happened. 4) Even with all of the above, I don't see how it fits in a "Don't buy first hand Google devices." statement. Maybe if you tell me "Don't deal with Project Fi service" I could somewhat agree. hunter2 http://disq.us/p/1iz7ts3 Sorry, should have permalinked the comment since the order is moving per votes. That guy was the original owner and claims to have been paid off. Moved to Verizon at some point and had the device he originally bough directly from Google blacklisted. Max Well that negates my point 2 and sucks even more. But still the blame here points 100% to Project Fi and not the phone itself nor Google as the manufacturer of the phone. Something really strange is happening with Project Fi devices and hopefully they will find out soon if it's an error, incompetence, sabotage or maybe even hacking. hunter2 I guess it depends on how willing you are to absolve the parent company of things a specific branch is doing. It would be like saying "don't blame MS, it's the IE team who makes the browser" during the IE6 days. Max Legally is evident that the responsibility is on Google but if you think that the group in charge of designing and manufacturing the Pixel has any minimal clue about what happens inside the group of the MVNO Project Fi then you're frankly clueless about how such a huge company works. By the way IE and Edge sucks but Visual Studio rocks and I'm liking more Windows 10 recently but I guess I should avoid using everything Microsoft because IE really sucks, right? hunter2 If a decisions like these can be made without going far enough up the chain of command that you're dealing with some higher ups, then I don't really want to know how this company runs. It's enough to tell me that I can't really trust them because you can't really depend on a company keeping in line with their corporate ideals when individual units can work with this much impunity. Avoiding/disliking MS was never about IE sucking. It was about IE being openly hostile and damaging to the web. This complaint was obviously projected at Microsoft themselves since no one believed that the IE team was working in a bubble. I don't know how old you are so maybe you weren't around when all this was going on. It's not about disliking a company because one or some of their many products are inferior. It's about disliking them because they employ user hostile tactics and you don't feel like you can support that (or at the very least want to punish them in the tiny way you can by voting with your wallet). Max So you already got an official response from Google about this? Can you share it? Because so far I have only read guesses about what is happening and nothing official yet. I'm old enough to have used MS-DOS 5 & 6 as well as Windows 3.1. That doesn't change the fact that saying "don't buy anything from a company" based on one division issues is just silly. If Google officially says that all of this was planned then maybe you could have a point, until then you're just stretching facts to prove a weak point. hunter2 I don't need to fill in the facts. I'm saying either way it's bad. The facts are that this happened. Additional facts about why it happened are irrelevant Max Well, if you're happy thinking like that be my guest, I guess some people is unable to see the colors and think the world is black and white. hunter2 For people whom this isn't a mundane thought experiment but are actually in a position where they need to buy a new device (not everyone is able to be without their phone until Google ultimately resolves this); the shades of gray in this scenario don't change their circumstances. The facts are that they have a phone that was remotely disabled. I'm assuming your shades of gray are the how's and why's of that? How is that of any consequence to these people? Steve_Jobroni Shut up, troll. DanSan got em! Matt This will be great for their resale value. ericshmerick Swappa comments: I GEEVE U $200 BUY NOW FINAL OFFERS!! JD Wooooo! Go Pixel, I'm definately not going near any Google hardware with a 1000ft pole now.I may use my 1001ft pole. In Many states, and at least in Canada this is not legal, you can't blacklist a phone for ToS violation. There's a very narrow list of reasons for a device to be blacklisted. Cuong This is a really shitty move from Google. At least sent a notification few days in advance and offer a way to appeal. What if a person was in an emergency situation? Imagine the lawsuit for that, Google. Why customers have to suffer because Google can't control their resellers? ericshmerick 911 always works. segag Thats Fuck all! Snowsky Mountain This may seriously make me rethink my use of Google hardware (especially phones). Stevie Do no evil Google. Do no evil. My Dixie Wrecked Yeah, they got rid of that mandate years ago. Seriously. Look it up. mxwp lol, yeah it was pretty funny. but i give Big G props for being somewhat honest about that. "hmm, we're huge now and so just cannot help to do some evil" Corey Kinard Just looked​ it up. Looks like it's still in place for Google. Alphabet's is different l though. It's "do the right thing." Sruly J Bought an unlocked Pixel yesterday for $334. Before I send it in to get checked and fixed by Google, I really should check the IMEI (normally I'd have the IMEI first, but the seller didn't give it to me). Michael D’Ambrosio "Someone with an answer." That'll get you far with Tech support. Smh vn33 Does the blacklisted phone works out of US, say in Canada? I assume yes, if it's the carriers that are doing the blacklisting. that said, it would really dampen my desire for a phone from Google. Stevie I am crossing my fingers that they don't come after my Nexus 6. Already bought and activated. There's no going back right? speedy1979 So to clarify google is randomly blacklisting any google pixel that is resold. I actually considered buying a ProjectFi device sometime ago; so glad I didn't go through with it. Kris Crowley I have fi service. When you buy a phone through fi you got a discount or a phone that you can't get through the Google store if you want. There is a disclaimer that if you buy it and never activate it that you will be charged additional Monies within 30 days. Now without knowing isn't possible that A the phone was bought at a discount and B the additional fee was levied but never paid? trixnkix637 Know the risks of buying used people. Do your homework. Asking where the seller bought the phone originally could've prevented all of this. Can't blame Google because someone tried to game the system both ways. marcusmarcus2 Know the risks of not using commas, people. You should never buy people, whether they are used or new. Rony Hmmm, is there a difference between a new and a used person. I've scoured the forums and haven't got a clear answer. marcusmarcus2 You would have to ask them before you buy them. They usually know when they've been used. But again, you should not buy any people. Def Ref But if you try to rent people, you start hearing words like "solicitation" and that's no fun. marcusmarcus2 Don't rent them either. While we are at it. Do not borrow, loan or steal people. Def Ref Is enticement allowed in your no fun world? Asking for a friend. marcusmarcus2 I don't see a problem with enticement as long as that enticement does not lead to stealing people. "No fun world"? You mean my world where I think people should not be viewed or treated as items/property? If yes, then yeah, I guess it is a no fun world. Def Ref Lighten up, Francis. marcusmarcus2 Lighten up, Francis? https://38.media.tumblr.com/39ef7347a58e308e67a5bd01cd124431/tumblr_nsld6lafvE1qh124lo1_500.gif Def Ref https://youtu.be/0OnpkDWbeJs That the title is misspelled AND mispunctuated is bonus. trixnkix637 Didn't NY and NV allow for the renting of people or is that wishful thinking? Asking for a friend. Rod This was so good, I had to sign into Disqus to upvote. trixnkix637 Buying people has been around for ages. Can't just stop now because of commas. marcusmarcus2 Buying used has been around for ages. trixnkix637 And so has it's risks. ericshmerick Wow I feel bad for the Swappa sellers who are getting PayPal charge backs right about now. Alexander Z Great This was the response I received. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/948da6656e25823e8dc529c4571fbc2d347f5e820ee9b7c91844d48c9745a112.png DanSan owner of the device ≠ person who purchased. way to go google. InnocentEd News flash this could happen with any phone from any manufacturer on any network that is resold used. I've had it happen with 2 iPhones and Apple could have cared less. You buy used, you take the risk. It's amazing how even credited tech journalists assume devices on Swappa are always going to be 100% safe. If Project Fi were not allowed to be resold via T&S then it's no diff than blacklisting a resold stolen phone...they had every right. Bewear This is why we can't have nice things. Rony Honestly this makes total sense. Its technically stealing the phone if you buy it for a discounted price and you dont activate it and sell it again. I think they made the right move. raffr It's not "technically" stealing. If you purchase a product at the price requested, you did not steal it. IF, big IF, in your purchase agreement it states you cannot resell the phone without activating it first, then google has a case. Serge Cebrian if you are paying for the service ... you are still paying for it even if you keep your older phone or a better phone if you want to unless you stop paying then its stealing ... but not if you keep the service// marcusmarcus2 They could have blacklisted these phones for that reason. But they could have also been overzealous when blacklisting devices and blacklisted numerous other devices that people did not do that with. It may have been the right move to block those that did do that, but if they inadvertently blocked additional devices, then hopefully they make the right move and unblock those devices that should not have been blocked. newtonfb Not new. Wife got a 5x on swappa. Phone was originally on FI but never taken off the account. We tried to activate it on FI but they did we couldn't until the owner released the phone? It worked fine on any other carrier. Had to get a new 5x Lance Biddle I paid off my pixel through project fi. I recently switched to Verizon. Yesterday Verizon notified me that my phone had been reported as stolen! When I awoke this morning my service had been disabled by Verizon. The support from Project Fi has been abysmal. What do I do to fix this? Corey Kinard Go to Reddit. Get ready for talks with the Better Business Bureau. Keep contacting Fi, keep screenshotting all the correspondences, you get all the buyers info in order to prove you are the original device owner. You don't fix this, you didn't cause it to break. Google fixes this. Everyone affected just has to light a fire under their ass. tnt Keep pushing / escalating with Project Fi. Ryan from GroupTweet I bought a Pixel from Tradeport USA (NH based company, shit!) about 3 months ago. The phone is on T-mobile right now and still currently working (fingers crossed). From my interpretation this appears only to be affecting Pixels bought through Google Fi - and perhaps not ones bought via Google Play store unlocked? Is that correct? Is there anyway I can check to see if my pixel was in fact sold via Google FI vs Google Play? Really hoping I don't wake up to a bricked phone in the next couple mornings... Sruly J You could contact Google, provide them with the IMEI, and they could let you know if it was bought through Google Play. Ryan from GroupTweet Thanks - but don't want to risk tipping them off that my phone should be on the blacklist :( Sruly J But wouldn't they know anyways if it should be blacklisted? I mean, how else would they have blacklisted so many phones this week? lauriedesautels So I have the Pixel and was planning on selling it via Swappa after my credits end from another phone. They ended up giving me a brand new Pixel XL but their service has become horrible where I live. So please correct me if I am wrong but if the Pixel is paid off and I switch carriers/ my Pixel is a paperweight? (I don't plan on using the phone on another carrier after 3 mo). ericshmerick According to this place, you can never sell it. You must carry it with you to your grave. Robert Montoya I have a Pixel that is currently blacklisted as of 5/23/2017 I bought it from Swappa... Google says they will lift the ban in 24 to 48 hours... That was 24 hours ago.. Phone still Blacklisted Wendell Brown I must have missed where it was shown that these deactivated phones were on Project Fi. As best I can tell, the only link to Fi is from an OLD article about the guy reselling phones several months ago. Is there any proof that this is in any way Fi related? MadJoe I have to say, if Google ever blacklisted my phone in a misguided sour-grapes attempt to punish the person who sold it to me, and without compensating me for it I would be rather angry. It would also be the absolute last Google product I ever purchased. As it is, this story has me glad I don't own anything more than a $25 Chromecast that I never use. I was seriously considering the Pixel 2 as my next phone, but not any more. If they were going to be such babies about the phones being resold, they should have vetted their buyers a little better. Corey Kinard It doesn't look like they were making any money off of you in the first place... Second-hand buyers/ bargain hunters rarely go out and pre-order $800 phones. Maybe you're different. They're definitely fucking up, but considering how little the pixel one sold and how much money they make I'm not sure they'll care about this any which way the wind blows. Same way Apple can just outright tell their customers to go fuck themselves over certain problems. MadJoe The problem is that too many people will ignore a company's unscrupulous behavior. If more of us would punished them by taking away access to our wallets, they'd think twice about trying to screw us. But people are lazy and lack commitment. So you're absolutely right, Google won't feel any hit by my deciding not to buy any more of their shit because a shit-ton of blind lemmings will gladly line up to jump off that spot on the cliff I chose not to use. And when a couple of them get screwed, they will cry "why isn't anyone else interested in helping me?" as the rest of the heard ignore them. On the bright side, the cycle will continue ad nauseum until I'm in a hole in the ground. Bruce Considering the ridiculous amount they are charging for the phones (Apple pricing without the Apple level support), this just about kills the resale value for a Pixel. Who the hell is going to buy a used phone for $500+ (because the original cost is so high) if their phones get blacklisted months later. And who the hell is going to buy the phones at the original price, when resale value will drop like a rock. And this doesn't even take into account all the BS that comes with the phone to begin with. 2 years of guaranteed OS updates. Hardware issues (Bluetooth, speakers, water resistance...) which don't get acknowledged amid finger pointing. Insufficient inventory even if they were open to replacements. The 128GB version (the 32GB is too little and the 64 GB doesn't exist) costs almost a $1000. The first time they tried this with the Nexus One, it didn't go well. This doesn't seem to be going much better. The Galaxy Nexus couldn't be upgraded because of drivers. The only real hits have been the Nexus 5 and the 6P. UniBroW *clutches iPhone 7 plus despite it's inferiority to android* Tj Hariharan Wait, do we actually KNOW that the phones that are blacklisted were originally purchased for reselling for profit? All i got from this article was that the phone was originally purchased from Project Fi.. RTNDO128 My phone was effected by this. I've been having issues with no T-Mobile service for the past couple of days on Project Fi. After reading this article, I used the Swappa IMEI checker and what do you know, my phone is reported "lost/stolen". I bought my Pixel on eBay at the beginning of January. Now I'm beyond their 30 day gaurentee. What an absolute clusterfuck. RTNDO128 My phone was effected by this. I've been having issues with no T-Mobile service for the past couple of days on Project Fi. After reading this article, I used the Swappa IMEI checker and what do you know, my phone is reported "lost/stolen". I bought my Pixel on eBay in the middle of February. Now I'm beyond their 30 day guarantee. What an absolute clusterfuck. Y2J You have 180 days in Paypal. RTNDO128 Thanks, I filed a claim with them. Hopefully this situation is covered. Max Did you contact first the seller? Otherwise it's a dick move to file a claim without first giving the seller the opportunity to see if he collaborates... RTNDO128 Thanks for your opinion. As stated, I'm beyond the 30 day eBay guarantee window. I created a "dispute" through the PayPal Resolution Center, which sends a message directly to the seller. PayPal is totally uninvolved with the dispute until I choose to escalate, which will only happen if I cannot get this resolved with the seller first. I just want to have our conversations documented in the event that the seller does not want to deal with this situation. Ken Kinda weird Google said that IMEI can't be blocked by manufacturer, I'm sure that's true. But what when manufacturer is also technically the carrier? Da_James Are you saying that "buying" a device in the USA doesn't mean you own it? Just SUE. Steve_Jobroni > as it's the carrier and not the manufacturer that has the ability to blacklist devices Do people not read the full article anymore? There seems to be a lot of Jabroni's blaming Google when it's the carrier that can only do the blacklisting. Sir_Brizz But that carrier is Project Fi, aka Google... Aleksandr Ivanov Change IMEI, problem solved! AbdulB1 lol Cassidy James Blaede I'd be interested in hearing how widespread this actually is, and a response from Google. My mom bought a Pixel from Swappa because Google was out of stock, and she's been loving it. I'd hate for her phone to become a brick because of this. Leonardo Baez I see a class action demand on the horizon? Đức Thành I'm a die-hard Google fan, but wow does Google need some fixing. justmy2pennies2012 There is one simple way Google can prevent the second hand market from making a profit. 1. Provide enough stock for all those who want to purchase the device! :) Bonus: Price the device accrodingly!! I gave up trying to buy one new from VZW and the Play Store. MisterAlex Did getting a Pixel phone through Fi require signing away your rights regarding "first sale?" And is that enforceable? RayNeverLearns You are Android Police. You might want to stay more up to date on this story and keep your readers updated, especially one that has a big impact on one of the purest Android flagships. http://www.techspot.com/news/69452-pixel-phones-project-fi-showing-up-blacklisted.html datkidpatrick happy to announce the phone i sold has been taken off the blacklist after communicating with project fi... so if you're affected by this contact google or more specifically project fi support... RayNeverLearns I believe Project Fi has done this for all affected Pixels. I didn't contact the person who sold it to me (Craigslist 7 months ago... wouldn't know where to even start) yet my phone was whitelisted earlier today. A little pain and it took almost 3 days, but a good resolution. datkidpatrick thats great... happy it's fixed... Amir What an idiotic move by Google. That's suicide. HardWired I wonder how long before Tesla implement a similar system in their cars :) Sorry you signed an agreement, the car has been disabled because you decided to sell it to a used car salesman for resale. Same sort of punishment that should not be legal.

Image Credit: Robbie Shade Google has reportedly launched a new program to support promising AI ventures. The initiative will provide services ranging from mentorship to workspace, according to Axios. The most promising startups or projects may receive co-investments from the new initiative and Google Ventures ranging from $1 million to $10 million. A Google spokesperson declined to comment. The new initiative could have something to do with Google’s recent acquisition of Kaggle, a data science startup that hosted competitions in which data scientists solve challenges provided by other companies. A series of new AI initiatives were recently announced at I/O, the annual Google developer conference, including the unveiling of a second-generation tensor processing unit for AI processing in the cloud and an invitation for mobile developers to use TensorFlow Lite. As part of its initiatives to democratize AI, Google also recently introduced the TensorFlow Research Cloud, a free AI computing service for top researchers and organizations like Harvard Medical School who are willing to share the results of their work in an open source environment.

Google is now offering four free months of Google Play Music for new subscribers Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/26 2:17pm PDTMay 26, 2017 82 Plus 1 on G+ 614 Share on Facebook 102 Share on Twitter Total Shares798 Google News Right now it looks like Google is running a special offer for Google Play Music. New subscribers that sign up here can get four free months of service instead of the usual three. No telling how long this offer might last, so if you have been considering subscribing, now might be the time to do it. It could save you an extra $10. Again, this particular offer is only for new subscribers. I've been a fan of Play Music for a long time, though the device removal limit does get in the way when you switch between devices and ROMs as often as I do. Being able to mix your own library with those of a service also comes in handy. That way I can continue to support artists I am passionate about, without eschewing the larger selection of a subscription offering for the purposes of content discovery, all while being able to fill the gaps in that library. There are a lot of different music services out there, but if you're interested combining your curated library with music available via a subscription, then your options are limited. Spotify does allow you to play back locally stored files, which is convenient, but it isn't quite the same. Amazon also allows you to upload your music for playback via Amazon Music, and with Amazon Prime membership, you get a small library of streaming music to go along with that. For $10 a month ($8 for Prime members) you can access their full library as well. But, Google Play Music has a great interface and plugs nicely into all the other Google services we love. Maybe with this new offer, it's time you gave Google Play Music a chance? After all, even if it doesn't end up working out, you still got four free months of music out of the deal.

Carson Saldanha Wait, wdym 3 different countries? Did you share it with others or something? Ailín Ó’S I live in Ireland, so that's my main account. I have a secondary account based in England as part of a mail forwarder service I use, and my bf is Greek so I had him check the code on his account :) Carson Saldanha Oh wow! Carson Saldanha Hey, since I know it worked for you, are you able to use YouTube Red along with this Play Music free trial? Because my YT Red doesn't seem to be enabled for me. Ailín Ó’S No, unfortunately not as I live in the EU and YouTube Red is only available in USA. Carson Saldanha Weird, I'm in the US though. Ailín Ó’S Ooh that is odd. Sign out of the app then sign back in maybe? Carson Saldanha No luck :( I'm in contact with Google support atm Hopefully they can sort this out Mike Worth it alone for Youtube Red MisterAlex Sweet, I wasn't sure if that was included. Thanks. Should mention that in the main blog post. Ben Still no student membership >:( Ailín Ó’S Spotify is a great alternative @€$£5/month. Ben I know that's what I use just because it's half the price. Ailín Ó’S In Ireland Vodafone have a partnership with Spotify whereby it costs €5 standard instead of €10 regardless of if you're a student or not, they even bundle it with some of their plans. Vodafone do the same in some other countries they operate in (not all). Maybe see if any network in your country has a partnership like that? Worth a shot! Ben Oh yeah I'm on EE in the UK and I've got Apple Music for free for 6 months but like iTunes is a massive stinking turd. Ailín Ó’S I'd rather go back to the days of getting music via Bluetooth from friends than use crApple Music 😂😂 Rahul Krishna In india, we have play music for 1.4 usd/month Umang Ladia I'm only seeing 2 months offer in India.?? Rahul Krishna Well I subscribed to it when it launched here (about 2 months ago), so I can't confirm that. But at this price, there is nothing to be disappointed about. aRvInD I wish Spotify launches soon here. I can't keep using that patched version here...!! Rahul Krishna Me too xyz As it should be, you can't charge European or American prices in India. Rahul Krishna Yes true. There are lots​ of people here with a very cheap Android phone. They cannot pay much money. Julian Coronado That's actually what's keeping me away from Play Music. I've used my free months and I loved the Youtube Red too. But as a student, Spotify for $5 / month is too great to pass up on. Emiliejmosley Google is paying 97$ per hour! Work for few hours & have longer with friends and family! !sm141c: On tuesday I got a great new Land Rover Range Rover from having earned $8752 this last four weeks.. Its the most-financialy rewarding I've had..

Cakefish Spotify ftw ToniCipriani ✓pǝᴉɟᴉɹǝʌ I don't think this is a new offer, got this a while back. In fact my 4 months is expiring next week. Prefer Spotify over it. Song selection a tad bit weaker, and for foreign songs it tries to translate the song names to English and makes it hard to look up. folkrav I like it, it's way cheaper than Spotify for me - my mother, my sister, my wife and myself each pay 30$ a year and we're set - but Jesus do I hate the clients. I don't like the website's interface, I hate the Android app. But yeah, I'll deal with it cause it's cheap, I guess. Carson Saldanha Got it! Yay! Jim I wish I could somehow get it on my Amazon Echo hahaha. I guess if I had paid for a Google Home it would be worth trying out. Forget vega #getEVGA Why google play music isn't available in my country ? Ailín Ó’S Try Apple Music? They seem to be just about everywhere. Iamsecond And this is why Apple continue to dominate, because Apple are truly interested in being an international company whereas Google is just playing at it. Such a shame xyz Because Google sucks. Bartek Juszczak My GPM radio's are so good these days I love that Google is so into AI. Whether It's just "I'm being lucky" or radio from a specific song, band or album they very rarely disappoint me these days. I just make sure to thumbs up if it plays a song I particularly love. I am a student and could go cheaper with spotify but the AI generated playlists have me locked in. If it's £5 cheaper but I'm not gonna enjoy it nearly as much then it's not really a good deal. AndTheWorldMayNeverKnow I used the 3 or 4 months free trial during the holidays then bought the family plan for $14.99 a month. 4 people in my family us it and it works great, the app could use some tweaks but it's really good overall. paev If you listen to main stream music it doesn't really matter what service to use. However, if you like something unusual, weird or other languages then Google is a way to go. I found bands on Google music that Spotify displayed as not found. Google also have new synth bands that Spotify doesn't. I'm for Google too. Daniel I discovered that GPM is kinda like a music label. I once went to a section of Google play explaining how indie artists can use GPM like a music label as long as they own all their rights. Ryne Hager Ultraista (among others) keeps me using Google Play Music as well as Spotify. Carson Saldanha Does anyone else who activated the Play Music trial have YouTube Red working as well? My YT Red doesn't seem to be enabled while my Play Music is. Michael Carr I spotted a similar offer a couple of months ago, and I took it after a day or two's thought. Just last week, I moved directly into a family plan. PewPewYoureDead It's hard to recommend Google Play Music until they revamp the UI. Margaritas Ante Porcos Google Music is the only choice in some markets, like Russia, where no Spotify or Pandora are available. There are too many shortcomings in Google Music and Google never shows interest in making services better than below average. I really wonder why Google refuses to become the best at anything. Real magic here. Pixel syndrome all the way. Yet Google Music is on my phone and I use it because there's no choice whatsoever. Rob You answered your own question. If there's no alternative, then they don't have any incentive to improve the service. SupahNin10doh Stupid Dorito logo... Raymond Berger Huh, I just subscribed to the trial but you youtube red hasn't kicked in yet. Any idea how long it takes? Iamsecond If you live in the UK, about 2 years so far h20ray Google Play Music is currently available in select territories and for select account types. Umang Ladia I'm only seeing 2 months offer in India, anybody can confirm? Mohammad Ovais Yeah, same for me. Maybe it's region limited. Isolde I think you need to open the link in a browser, if you open it in the app it's just the normal 2 months. bligui Confirmed need to open it from link and it works Manoj | Blogging Triggers Is Google Music really worth to it? We have better alternatives Sathiya Moorthy Karan I came across a great post, it seems to be so cool http://developeit.net/android-news-image-scanner-finder/ Zachariah Mann It only shows up as 2 free months for me. I live in Michigan. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a19b7e9dddb67bf897c751aedf63c01917048214140db901fd783b2182d8d5c0.png Jefferson Rodrigues https://play.google.com/music/listen?coupon=120DFREE&coupontype=vanity#/sulp Zachariah Mann That link still brought me to the same page on the Play Music App which offers 2 months free. Does it matter if I'm opening it on a computer or web page? Jefferson Rodrigues I don't know. Mikael Jakobsson Should mabye joine premium at Google Music if that coste like $2 max a month dont understand why they should take as mutch as someone some has app or Win32 software to PC so music controllers one they keyboards works. Tab out frome a game for pause music when the round is over is just bad. Arif Gürü And stil isnt available on Turkey xyz "No telling how long this offer might last, so if you have been considering subscribing, now might be the time to do it." No thanks, I'll just use YouTube. Only thing YT needs is an option to play audio only so I can save a wee bit more data when I don't need video. Cai Copley Nope. If it wasn't for the fact work pays for Spotify Premium and the fact Spotify has Crossfade to emulate a DJ system, maybe I'd give it a whirl. bligui Not working any more to bad Follow Android Police 1.49M 472k 145k 119k Latest Deals 9 [Deal Alert] Chromecast Ultra is $59.99 ($10 off) at Google Store, Best Buy, B&H and others 2017/06/04 12:16pm PDTJun 4, 2017 13 [Deal Alert] Google Home is $109 ($20 off) at Best Buy, Google Store, B&H, and others 2017/06/04 10:07am PDTJun 4, 2017 12 [Deal Alert] Kick off the weekend with 24 temporarily free and 52 on-sale apps 2017/06/03 6:50pm PDTJun 3, 2017 18 [Deal Alert] Get a Nextbit Robin for $129.99 on eBay 2017/06/03 9:39am PDTJun 3, 2017 33 [Deal Alert] A Stork's Journey is currently free on Google Play Movies & TV 2017/06/01 10:50pm PDTJun 1, 2017 Latest Poll How many photos are on your Google Photos account?

[Update: Now $75 Off] Deal Alert: Pixel 32GB (international version) is $50 off on eBay Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/05/26 2:20pm PDTMay 26, 2017 2 Plus 1 on G+ 53 Share on Facebook 57 Share on Twitter Total Shares112 Deals News Pixel Update 1: 2017/05/26 2:32pm PDT It looks like the price has dropped another $25, making this a $75 savings in total. For a device that hasn't seen much in the way of price drops or It's no secret that Google has had some serious supply issues with its flagship Pixel phone. That goes for pretty much any combination of size, color, or storage. Rumors even began to surface alleging that Google had stopped production of the devices altogether. That wasn't the case, but nonetheless, you will still struggle to actually find the Pixel if you wish to buy it. A 32GB Pixel (international version) on eBay for $50 off the list price could be the answer to that problem. This is the entry level 5" Pixel, with 32GB of storage in the color Very Silver - and it's available for $599. That's $50 less than the $649 Google is still charging for it. Beware though, this is the international version of the device. So if you live in the US you'll have to check the bands to see if it works on your network. This version won't play nice with Verizon or Sprint, so if you're on either of those carriers you can rule this out. If you live outside the US then this is definitely for you. Shipping appears to be free in the US, but here in the UK, it's $18.99. That still works out a bargain for me, especially if you account for the exchange rate. You'll have to do the sums from where you are to see if the deal is as good for you. It's worth mentioning that getting your warranty honored might be tough with this type of purchase, so bear that in mind. It's hard to say how many of these they have, other than a "limited quantity," so you'll have to be quick if you want to get your hands on arguably the best Android phone of 2016. Update 1: 2017/05/26 2:32pm PDT It looks like the price has dropped another $25, making this a $75 savings in total. For a device that hasn't seen much in the way of price drops or sales since launch, $75 off isn't bad.

Then I'll get one. shamatuu that will never happen james fuston Looks like we found the one guy still using a Fire Phone. Middlefinger As a back up phone yeah, its not reliable enough to be a daily driver. Its problems seem to be a mixture of hardware bugs, and Googles poor software QC. me me "bargain" JL "buggy" Gladysrcrosby Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job. Even everyone not used to this, can make $89/per h easily and the earnings can go even higher over time...

It doesnt matter how 'high end' a device is, if it doesn't work properly, its worthless. jonzey231 $50 is worth a guarantee that Google will honor the warranty....trust me...I wish I would've gotten my 6P direct. Andy What do you mean? jonzey231 If you don't buy the phone from Google, they won't help you. They send you to the manufacturer. I was forced to go to Huawei for my 6P and it was a little over 3 weeks before I got it back....and the problem is still there. Spend the extra $50 and buy it through Google so you're guaranteed to get support through their CS channels. You'll be glad you did in 6 months when something inevitably goes wrong. IMHO get the OnePlus 3T. Costs less but has better overall specs aside from the camera which is still pretty good in its own right. My brother has one and my roommate just got his last week and they both have no intention of going back to a major brand ever again. YaKillaCJ Same happened when I got the OnePlus One. It changed the way I (and many others) view a "budget" device from an unknown brand. needa I felt the same way after using an OPO for nearly three years. Got me an XL in mint condition for $450. Google edition even. Still had 3520 mAh in the batt too. Would have bought the black 3T had they been in stock. Took me three days to hunt down this deal. Andy Got my wife the pixel. Runs great. Just had the microphone problem. Google swapped without question. Wife seems to think it takes horrible selfies. Rod Weird, as it's cameras are regarded among the best currently. Random! @andy maybe you should let her know that the camera isn't the problem... It's actually her face. If you do warn her about this, I promise to visit you at the hospital. Andy Thanks for the tip. VAVAMk_2 Huzzah! Master Yates Agreed with you regarding the 3T. Lets see if the excellent updates and support evaporate when the One Plus 5 is released? That's the real test. IcerC Except in this case Google is the Manufacturer, that might change things. VAVAMk_2 Google didn't make the camera. Uses a Sony made sensor but the camera software is Google's and regarded among the best in post processing, particularly HDR. Roy Ahh so nice call me when the 1+2 will get Nougat and your friend will get or never get Android O. ddevito #Fail Andy S8 release response? AdMoc Does not ship to Poland as fck always -_- Random! Look for some service like Shipito. I believe they have an EU warehouse. Shakil Shaikh $60 shipping? kristin ANY Pixel made by google is compatible with any provider. It doesnt matter if its international or not. This writer is an odiot. Scott Scrivens https://www.techwalls.com/google-pixel-pixel-xl-model-number-differences/ Kevin Davis "Odiot", lmao. 😂 Oh, and you're wrong, too. kristin I called google about this. It would be up your phone company provider whether it worked or not. So it may not work with att or tmobile either. kristin This may or may not work on any provider. Its up to the provider. You want a pixel? Go to swappa.com and get one used in mint condition for much cheaper. Ive gotten a few phones from them since ive been on project fi and had no issues. Ill never buy a new phone again. Random! $50 off? How cute... If they get to $300 off ($350 final price) within a month, I might even convince myself it's worth to stare at those bezels everyday. Other than that (impossible) scenario, I'd rather get the 3T, Axon 7, or even the LG G5. Gjorgi Lazarovski The Pixel is probably not dropping in price anytime soon. iKon The most overrated smartphone of 2016. Only the camera is decent. Ugly ass design, overpriced and dull with no features compared to competition Roy You mean the best smartphone of 2016, best camera rare band front, best software, best updates. Great battery, great display. xyz No, he means "The most overrated smartphone of 2016. Only the camera is decent. Ugly ass design, overpriced and dull with no features compared to competition." Roy No, I'm sure he/she means "the best smartphone of 2016, best camera rare band front, best software, best updates. Great battery, great display". iKon No I meant what I said. The pixel is a flop and even Google knows it. No matter how much money they put into advertising there are alot of better choices out there.. only hard core Google fanboys try and big it up Roy Yes yada yada and still every reviewer said is the best smartphone of 2016. So.. even David here. In the on of the day it's a lots about the UI and I just don't like Samsung software. Ordeith LOL. You're such a Google sycophant, Roy. Roy You feeling really smart? I'm Imagine your ass all over your face. nirmitlamed Google is so off track in figuring out what customers wants and competing against the other monstrous companies. I would very much like to hear how many Pixels Google sold in the last year since they told us they sold more than they expected. Lawrence I can put my coffee cup on the Bezel David Nowicki I'm a big Nexus fan, but why would you pay $749 for the Pixel XL vs the OnePlus 3T at about half the price ? And soon the OnePlus 5 at $450 or so with S8+ specs will be a steal compared to the Pixel 4Ui812 Supply and demand. Limit the supply and you increase demand. It's like P.T. Barnum said , "There's a sucker born every minute".

Suggested Sharing is going live in Google Photos for some users Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/25 5:30pm PDTMay 25, 2017 41 Plus 1 on G+ 118 Share on Facebook 77 Share on Twitter Total Shares236 Applications Google News Google Photos is ground zero for the company's crazy machine learning technology. At Google I/O 2017, a number of new features were announced for Photos, including suggested sharing based on who's in a certain photo. But for that to work, Google needs to figure out who is who, and now the Photos web app is asking users to identify what they look like. Upon visiting photos.google.com, you may be welcomed by the above screen. Google already uses machine learning wizardry to match faces to people, so all you have to do is select which face is yours. Once you do that, you'll be able to search for "me" in the Photos search to find pictures of yourself. According to a recent teardown, this option should appear at some point in the Photos app as well, but it didn't for me. Presumably, this will be far more useful once the other features announced at Google I/O show up. Let us know in the comments if you have received the pop-up.

I got the pop up just the other day. I can search for "me" in addition to others such as my daughter's name. John Doe I did but for some reason it shows a photo of me from over 6 years ago even though I have plenty of recent photos LoL Corbin Davenport Yep, my picture was an awful photo of me from several years ago. John Doe I was able to change it by going to people then clicking on the picture and even when you choose a picture with a lot of people in it figures out which one is you and zooms in...creepy bozzykid It doesn't matter what photo you choose of yourself. The rest are all linked to you anyways. This isn't replacing your profile pic. John Doe No but some photos it has not figured out its me or at least when I click on me it doesn't show all the pictures of me but it is good enough to find pictures of me when I was a child which is crazy because I changed a lot. Stakoman Is this US only? would be great if you guys made a "how to enable face recognition google photos" post Suicide_Note Use a US VPN to start using the face recognition. Once you get things setup, you can stop using the VPN, though face recognition should still work. rndusrnm479461 You can use a VPN (get tunnelbear cause it's free) for Android, then clear cache, open photos and enable grouping of faces in the settings. Then you can disable VPN. I did this about a year ago and I've had it ever since without any problem both on Android and on the web. bozzykid I believe it uses one of the firsts photos you have stored. It has already linked the rest to you anyways. Régis Knechtel Not always, apparently, cause it used a recent photo for me. I think it's random. Brendapdaniels Google is paying 97$ per hour!

LightofHonor Has been there for me for awhile. Useful since I can search multiple names and it shows all the pictures with those people in it. Defenestratus No. Régis Knechtel "his option should appear at some point in the Photos app as well" It asked to chose my face me today in the android app, while I was setting up a new phone. jcopernicus I accidentally closed the prompt...how to I get it back? Corbin Davenport On the web, go to Settings -> Group similar faces, and there should be an option to pick your face. Yatin No, I'm from India Drakenoid Yes, I'm also from India. Naga Sridhar I am from India too, but are you in India? myssi Pop-up recieved, I'm from Pakistan. Tomáš Petrík And I guess we will be left out in the EU, again :/ Indefinite Implosion I'm in NL and got it a few days ago? A day or two after the announcement maybe (crunch time, so days are a blur). I didn't tip because it doesn't do anything right now so hardly seems worthy of a post. roberto.elena Do you already have "group similar faces" activated? If yes, then you will get this update. Tomáš Petrík No, it is disabled for accounts registered in the EU due to some stupid privacy ruling of the EU. roberto.elena I know, but you can activate it using a VPN (or at least that was possible when they launched Google Photos). Once it's activated, you don't need the VPN anymore, and you get all updates related to face recognition features. Nelson Not correct. I'm in Europe and by using Opera VPN plus Google Photos cache clear the feature appeared Amir Instead of copying and pasting your Debbie Downer response on every single comment, go try it with a VPN. Gosh! Tomáš Petrík I don't know who Debbie Downer is and I posted a similar response only due to the fact that I want to react to multiple people and I want them all to get a notification so that they know somebody replied to their post. Suicide_Note Use a US VPN and you can join the party. Tomáš Petrík It's not about VPN this time. Accounts registered in the EU have facial recognition disabled due to some stupid privacy ruling of the EU. Jens Törnblad That's why you activate the feature with a VPN. Suicide_Note Ah, okay. I wasn't aware of that. Definitely sucks. Mr K Nope. I cleaned data from Google Photos and force closed, activated Tunnelbear (it's free for 500MB but you won't use more than 50) in the US and opened Photos. Configured everything (make sure face recognition" is activated in settings) and everything works fine. I just got the notification in Photos for web about this new feature. And you can of course uninstall the VPN when everything is set up. rndusrnm479461 Get tunnelbear for Android. Choose a US vpn. Clear Google Photos cache -> open it -> enable grouping of faces in the settings. You only have to do this once. I did it a year ago and it has worked ever since on all my devices. Tomáš Petrík It's not about VPN this time, though. Accounts registered in the EU have facial recognition disabled due to some stupid privacy ruling of the EU. rndusrnm479461 Really? I registered mine in EU in ~2008 and activated face grouping in early 2016 without problems. henleyb I got it a day or two ago. Was an old photo but searching for 'me' did bring up correct photos for me so that's something. Looking forward to the sharing stuff next. :) Suicide_Note Haven't seen this popup yet, but on a related note, photo books have gone live for me in the Photos app. Taylor Hardy I work from ease of my residence, with the help of easy jobs that merely usually requires from you a Computer system and even on-line connection and I am also more successful than ever before... After six months time in this work and i got paid in total Thirty six Thousand us dollars...

I immediately went to my S7 to see did I have it and nothing. Joao Letelier Ummm... I have been able to search for "me" since last year on the photos app on my phone. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/6ec05347bcd3f095b697a97df58508cf28a8d34b7fc289baa308796bc81cf2b3.jpg Deeco Skynet. slowly, but surely...

Google earlier this week unveiled Google Attribution, a tool that uses machine learning to measure the effectiveness of online marketing campaigns across a variety of devices and channels. Part of a series of new measurement tools introduced at Google Marketing Next, Google Attribution aims to help marketers determine what is driving consumers to make their online purchasing decisions. Google is at an "inflection point," noted Sridhar Ramaswamy, senior vice president of ads and commerce, when it comes to the use of technology to measure online marketing effectiveness. "What's exciting is that things that were really hard we're going to be able to make easy, because technology is doing the heavy lifting," he told conference attendees. Seconds Matter Page-loading time is an important factor in terms of how long advertisers have to hook a consumer online, Ramaswamy said. As load time increased from one to seven seconds, the probability of a consumer bouncing more than doubled, found a recent study that analyzed 900,000 mobile landing pages in more than 100 countries. That translates to conversions falling by up to 20 percent for every one second delay in page-load time. Most existing attribution measurement tools have three main shortcomings, according to Ramaswamy. First, they lose track of the customer journey when they move between tools; second, they are hard to set up; and third, they are not integrated with ad tools. Because of those shortcomings, marketers typically are stuck with using last-click attribution, which misses the impact of most marketing touchpoints. The new Google Attribution tool incorporates data from AdWords, Google Analytics and DoubleClick Search, which provides a more comprehensive picture of data from all marketing channels, according to Google. Google Attribution also makes it easy to switch over to data-driven attribution, which uses ads, keywords and campaigns that have the greatest impact on a company's goals, Google said. Using the data-driven attribution model typically requires a minimum set of data, which is 15,000 clicks, and at least 600 conversions within a 30-day period. Google will offer an enterprise version, Google Attribution 360, to meet the needs of larger advertisers, noted Bill Kee, group product manager at the company. Google Attribution currently is in beta and will roll out to additional customers over the next few months. Not Quite Ready Google Attribution is an "aspirational sell" for advertisers, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses, suggested Paul Teich, principal analyst at Tirias Research. "Google intends to make it free, so it will see a lot of uptake, but many users will have zero comparative experience to judge how much better they are doing with Attribution," he told the E-Commerce Times. The major benefit will be providing more-accessible feedback for designing online user experiences, Teich said, noting that it's not clear how artificial intelligence can make a contribution -- at least until Attribution has been able to analyze millions of Web pages. Google is ahead of the curve compared to other Internet companies, which are only average at measuring the efficacy of online marketing, observed Michael Jude, a program manager at Stratecast/Frost & Sullivan. "Machine learning does give it an edge in making sense of the relationship between key clicks and online purchases," he told the E-Commerce Times. "While simple algorithms can provide some insight, especially as applied to last click models, machine learning can understand such things as click back, where the last key click is not the purchase, but rather an artifact of comparison shopping," Jude explained. Data Points Google made several other announcements related to providing additional marketing data. It launched a new AdWords beta to let advertisers use fast-loading AMP pages as landing pages for search ads and to speed up ads across the Google Display Network. This follows Google's introduction about 18 months ago of the Accelerated Mobile Pages project to speed up the Web with faster browsing. Google also announced a new tool to bring in-market audiences to Search, in order to help advertisers reach users who are ready to buy their products. Using machine learning, the tool analyzes trillions of search queries and millions of websites to determine when searchers are close to making a buying decision on a product. The company unveiled plans to roll out store-sales measurement at the device and campaign levels, which will allow advertisers to measure in-store revenue and store visits delivered by search and shopping ads. If advertisers collect email information at the point of sale through loyalty programs, Google said, store transactions can be imported directly into Adwords by the advertiser or through a third-party data partner.

Google is now offering four free months of Google Play Music for new subscribers Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/26 2:17pm PDTMay 26, 2017 82 Plus 1 on G+ 614 Share on Facebook 102 Share on Twitter Total Shares798 Google News Right now it looks like Google is running a special offer for Google Play Music. New subscribers that sign up here can get four free months of service instead of the usual three. No telling how long this offer might last, so if you have been considering subscribing, now might be the time to do it. It could save you an extra $10. Again, this particular offer is only for new subscribers. I've been a fan of Play Music for a long time, though the device removal limit does get in the way when you switch between devices and ROMs as often as I do. Being able to mix your own library with those of a service also comes in handy. That way I can continue to support artists I am passionate about, without eschewing the larger selection of a subscription offering for the purposes of content discovery, all while being able to fill the gaps in that library. There are a lot of different music services out there, but if you're interested combining your curated library with music available via a subscription, then your options are limited. Spotify does allow you to play back locally stored files, which is convenient, but it isn't quite the same. Amazon also allows you to upload your music for playback via Amazon Music, and with Amazon Prime membership, you get a small library of streaming music to go along with that. For $10 a month ($8 for Prime members) you can access their full library as well. But, Google Play Music has a great interface and plugs nicely into all the other Google services we love. Maybe with this new offer, it's time you gave Google Play Music a chance? After all, even if it doesn't end up working out, you still got four free months of music out of the deal.

Carson Saldanha Wait, wdym 3 different countries? Did you share it with others or something? Ailín Ó’S I live in Ireland, so that's my main account. I have a secondary account based in England as part of a mail forwarder service I use, and my bf is Greek so I had him check the code on his account :) Carson Saldanha Oh wow! Carson Saldanha Hey, since I know it worked for you, are you able to use YouTube Red along with this Play Music free trial? Because my YT Red doesn't seem to be enabled for me. Ailín Ó’S No, unfortunately not as I live in the EU and YouTube Red is only available in USA. Carson Saldanha Weird, I'm in the US though. Ailín Ó’S Ooh that is odd. Sign out of the app then sign back in maybe? Carson Saldanha No luck :( I'm in contact with Google support atm Hopefully they can sort this out Mike Worth it alone for Youtube Red MisterAlex Sweet, I wasn't sure if that was included. Thanks. Should mention that in the main blog post. Ben Still no student membership >:( Ailín Ó’S Spotify is a great alternative @€$£5/month. Ben I know that's what I use just because it's half the price. Ailín Ó’S In Ireland Vodafone have a partnership with Spotify whereby it costs €5 standard instead of €10 regardless of if you're a student or not, they even bundle it with some of their plans. Vodafone do the same in some other countries they operate in (not all). Maybe see if any network in your country has a partnership like that? Worth a shot! Ben Oh yeah I'm on EE in the UK and I've got Apple Music for free for 6 months but like iTunes is a massive stinking turd. Ailín Ó’S I'd rather go back to the days of getting music via Bluetooth from friends than use crApple Music 😂😂 Rahul Krishna In india, we have play music for 1.4 usd/month Umang Ladia I'm only seeing 2 months offer in India.?? Rahul Krishna Well I subscribed to it when it launched here (about 2 months ago), so I can't confirm that. But at this price, there is nothing to be disappointed about. aRvInD I wish Spotify launches soon here. I can't keep using that patched version here...!! Rahul Krishna Me too xyz As it should be, you can't charge European or American prices in India. Rahul Krishna Yes true. There are lots​ of people here with a very cheap Android phone. They cannot pay much money. Julian Coronado That's actually what's keeping me away from Play Music. I've used my free months and I loved the Youtube Red too. But as a student, Spotify for $5 / month is too great to pass up on. Emiliejmosley Google is paying 97$ per hour! Work for few hours & have longer with friends and family! !sm141c: On tuesday I got a great new Land Rover Range Rover from having earned $8752 this last four weeks.. Its the most-financialy rewarding I've had..

Cakefish Spotify ftw ToniCipriani ✓pǝᴉɟᴉɹǝʌ I don't think this is a new offer, got this a while back. In fact my 4 months is expiring next week. Prefer Spotify over it. Song selection a tad bit weaker, and for foreign songs it tries to translate the song names to English and makes it hard to look up. folkrav I like it, it's way cheaper than Spotify for me - my mother, my sister, my wife and myself each pay 30$ a year and we're set - but Jesus do I hate the clients. I don't like the website's interface, I hate the Android app. But yeah, I'll deal with it cause it's cheap, I guess. Carson Saldanha Got it! Yay! Jim I wish I could somehow get it on my Amazon Echo hahaha. I guess if I had paid for a Google Home it would be worth trying out. Forget vega #getEVGA Why google play music isn't available in my country ? Ailín Ó’S Try Apple Music? They seem to be just about everywhere. Iamsecond And this is why Apple continue to dominate, because Apple are truly interested in being an international company whereas Google is just playing at it. Such a shame xyz Because Google sucks. Bartek Juszczak My GPM radio's are so good these days I love that Google is so into AI. Whether It's just "I'm being lucky" or radio from a specific song, band or album they very rarely disappoint me these days. I just make sure to thumbs up if it plays a song I particularly love. I am a student and could go cheaper with spotify but the AI generated playlists have me locked in. If it's £5 cheaper but I'm not gonna enjoy it nearly as much then it's not really a good deal. AndTheWorldMayNeverKnow I used the 3 or 4 months free trial during the holidays then bought the family plan for $14.99 a month. 4 people in my family us it and it works great, the app could use some tweaks but it's really good overall. paev If you listen to main stream music it doesn't really matter what service to use. However, if you like something unusual, weird or other languages then Google is a way to go. I found bands on Google music that Spotify displayed as not found. Google also have new synth bands that Spotify doesn't. I'm for Google too. Daniel I discovered that GPM is kinda like a music label. I once went to a section of Google play explaining how indie artists can use GPM like a music label as long as they own all their rights. Ryne Hager Ultraista (among others) keeps me using Google Play Music as well as Spotify. Carson Saldanha Does anyone else who activated the Play Music trial have YouTube Red working as well? My YT Red doesn't seem to be enabled while my Play Music is. Michael Carr I spotted a similar offer a couple of months ago, and I took it after a day or two's thought. Just last week, I moved directly into a family plan. PewPewYoureDead It's hard to recommend Google Play Music until they revamp the UI. Margaritas Ante Porcos Google Music is the only choice in some markets, like Russia, where no Spotify or Pandora are available. There are too many shortcomings in Google Music and Google never shows interest in making services better than below average. I really wonder why Google refuses to become the best at anything. Real magic here. Pixel syndrome all the way. Yet Google Music is on my phone and I use it because there's no choice whatsoever. Rob You answered your own question. If there's no alternative, then they don't have any incentive to improve the service. SupahNin10doh Stupid Dorito logo... Raymond Berger Huh, I just subscribed to the trial but you youtube red hasn't kicked in yet. Any idea how long it takes? Iamsecond If you live in the UK, about 2 years so far h20ray Google Play Music is currently available in select territories and for select account types. Umang Ladia I'm only seeing 2 months offer in India, anybody can confirm? Mohammad Ovais Yeah, same for me. Maybe it's region limited.

Here are a few ways machine learning has improved Gboard Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/24 4:33pm PDTMay 24, 2017 38 Plus 1 on G+ 113 Share on Facebook 127 Share on Twitter Total Shares278 Applications Google Videos Google has been improving Gboard with the same type of tools it uses for speech recognition: machine learning. The budding technology is rapidly becoming a ubiquitous method for improving results and performance. If a network can be trained to accurately accomplish something in a performant way, odds are you'll see it introduced to any product it can be applied to. Gboard and text-input as a whole are no different, and we are reaping the benefits of improved corrections and predictions every time we swipe out a low-accuracy message to a friend. But how do these improvements work? This is going to be a pretty technical post, and I'm going to do my best to simplify things to a level where everyone can enjoy the subject. All of this is based on a recent Google Research blog post. If you are really into machine learning and you already know what every term I might use means, the source link is probably the best place for you to learn about the cool new stuff in Gboard. If, however, you think you might want a few of the concepts or terms explained, then this article might be the place for you. Google's latest research blog post is all about one thing: Gboard. The authors talk about some of the new features that were shown off at I/O, like the transliteration tools for typing in a language you might only have a phonetic familiarity with. But the biggest things discussed in the article relate to how input is determined, and the models and math that determine which swipes equate to which words, and how to most accurately correct mistakes. The two solutions Google has found revolve around its neural spatial models for processing input, and finite-state transducers for state progression to accurately determine content. These sound like complex ideas, but their cleverness can be explained. Input Neural spatial models are just a fancy way of saying machine learning applied to any space. For instance, the physical Gboard keyboard layout itself. When we type, we sometimes type wrong. And when we swipe, we sometimes swipe wrong. I might have meant to drag over "P" for this word, but I only made it to O. That's where these neural spatial models come in handy. They are able to determine probabilities for which letters you meant to hit based on physical proximity of input, as well as predictive models based on trained corrections. Originally, Gboard used a Gaussian model, combed with a set of simple rules. That's a fancy way of saying it used physical proximity in a sort of bell-curve out from a given key, combined with a basic understanding of certain common errors. The developers have replaced the older Gaussian and rule-based model with an LSTM, or long short-term memory model, trained by a CTC, or connectionist temporal classification. Big somewhat scary acronyms, but they're actually pretty simple ideas. A long short-term memory is a particular kind of neural net ideal for use in applications of intermittent or unknown event/time latencies, and Google has previously used these for speech recognition, the Google Assistant, and Google Translate. A connectionist temporal classification is a specific method of training a neural network. After all, a neural network is nothing without data to derive weighted triggers and values from. In this case, it means segmenting data input to the network by time and allowing the network to retroactively refer to input, states, and output before and after the current set. To further simplify, it means referring to data at many stages of analysis from multiple periods of time, increasing the value of context in the network's training. To pull data for training, Google used data sets comprised of information collected when users opt-in to share snippets, and set reverted corrections and suggestions as negative signals, and accepted corrections or suggestions as positive. To help visualize how it might work, we have this image. In the above, the left represents individual data points from the word "could" as swiped on Gboard. The right is a normalized temporal data for the same swiped input. By being able to refer to the probable center of an input, in temporal context with inputs that came before and after, we can tell that the overall path means "Could" even if we might not have hit a couple of letters quite right. Google was further able to adapt some of its speech recognition tools and data and apply it to corrections and suggestions in Gboard, optimizing things over iterations with a heavy dose of Tensorflow to increase the speed of analysis and output and decrease the number of errors. All that is well and good, but Google can also leverage the rules of a language to enhance predictions. As a basic example, consider: If you tapped O-T instead of I-T, Gboard can look at its dictionary and determine that "OT" isn't something you are likely to input, but that the similar "IT" is a word. Furthermore, "I" is physically close to "O," so you probably meant "IT." Easy. Well, Google is able to do a similar but improved sort thing via what is called a finite-state transducer. Processing To vastly over-simplify, a finite-state transducer, in this case, means an order of operations for processing input. The operational flow above shows the various stages of potential input for the words "I," "I've," and "If." In this image, input at each stage comes before the ":" (with ε representing nothing as either input or output), and potential outputs are shown after the ":" as they each become logical. So we start having input the letter "i." From the top path we can see, if there is no additional input, then "I" is the correct output. If an apostrophe or space follows, followed by the letter "v," then "I've" is the likely output. If the letter "f" follows, then "If" is the likely output. The final two flows at the bottom return to start. You can think of it as just a series of rules for input and output. Google is able to use these same tools at other scales. For instance, developers can create these logical chains for whole words and their contexts, combined with the spatial models above and statistical likelihoods for possible inputs. These tools also apply to the transliteration features that were shown off at I/O. By implementing those same workflows and networks towards phonetically spelled input, it can guess what characters or words in another language you might mean. For anyone that might speak a language, but not know how to spell it, that's pretty cool. Unfortunately, if you can't read the language, you aren't really in a position to know if what it's typing is right or wrong, but it's still a useful tool. Output Gboard and machine learning are both pretty fantastically interesting and complex subjects. I hope our simplification of the tools behind it has helped you understand a bit more behind how it all works. It's useful to have knowledge about how the things we use on a daily basis work, not just in an abstract sense for intellectual fulfillment, but to provide us with a base for troubleshooting when things might go wrong. Now when GBoard makes seemingly odd recommendations, you might have a small idea as to why.

It's also buggy and crashy as hell. I switched to SwiftKey and haven't looked back. elijahblake it is very, very, very, bad at predicting correct words.. I do miss swiftkey sometimes. I guess i'm just hanging in there hoping the gboard starts learning. Just today instead of "this" it put "thoe" Dennis Ulijn I accidentally typed htought and it corrected it to brought instead of thought... Like... Why?! dimm0k I've mentioned this before... prior to the change of name to Gboard when it was Google Keyboard, the prediction was actually decent! since the name change however I agree that the prediction has been pretty crappy! words that I've typed pretty often still get mistaken for some other random word that doesn't even work in the sentence I'm typing out! JD I'm not the only one the noticed. That since the GBoard change it's turned to shit. When it was Google Keyboard it was neck and neck with Swiftkey David Thoren That's interesting.. I've never really used the prediction to type with, I just swipe through without looking, so I can't really speak to that.. But I have never seen Gboard crash or even get unstable. KlausWillSeeYouNow Gboard is totally unstable on my LG V20. Maybe it's just something specific to my device – but only recent versions of Gboard have had this issue for me. I miss the days of Google Keyboard, a stable product that actually worked. gv Haven't had any stability problems with g'board; don't think it's even crashed once on my axon7. But then again, it doesn't work worth a damn either, so is that really such an accomplishment? KlausWillSeeYouNow Yeah. Amen. Sounds like you and I should have a beer sometime. We clearly feel the same about Gboard. gv You can apply all the fancy machine learning you want, doesn't change that gv is total shit at predicting swiped words... it's so bad that I've gone back to swype despite it being a resource hog and slow. My favorite thing is you'll swipe a word, and gv will take a guess and be really wrong. So you'll back over it, swipe it again and gv will guess the EXACT SAME WORD. So you'll back over it, swipe it again, and gv will now be so sure that it won't offer *any* alternative suggestions (even though the alternative suggestions were also wrong) the third time. Machine learning, my ass! Machine stupidity; if it wasn't the correct word the first or second time you can be damn sure it's not the correct word the third time! So then you type in the word you actually want, and next sentence you need the same word. Idiot gv then suggests the original word AGAIN when you swipe it. Machine learning, my ass! At least swype is smart enough to know that if you just used a word it didn't swype in correctly, next time you swype something close to that (even if you didn't permanently add it to the dictionary) that's likely the word you wanted! KlausWillSeeYouNow AMEN! PREACH! I second this. It's so annoying. You said it better than I ever could, pal. Whatever Gboard's doing, it isn't working. Carson Saldanha I'm even on the beta on my 2014 Nexus 6 and it's running just fine--no crashes or anything. blahmoomoo If they can one day figure out when I mean to say "if" or "of", I'll be happy. It feels like less of a problem recently, but it still happens sometimes... Lare2 The problem I have with Gboard is that when you write on two languages and forget to change the language, over the time, it will start suggesting words on the wrong language. Rod This. On the other hand, Swiftkey handles languages nicely. h4rr4r It does this to me constantly. What I hate is that enabling a language for this requires adding its keyboard. For languages with the same alphabet but different layout it is really annoying. big_al77 I love gboard. Best keyboard for a while now Miku is Best Vocaloid I started using it as soon as they added bilingual prediction. Ha hecho mi vida mucho más fácil.

Ahora puedo escribir mis mensajes en spanglish sin problemas :) matteventu And why the hell when I write in Italian it often tells me "Download now the Portuguese dictionary" (or some shit like that) as a tip? Can't it understand that I'm writing in Italian, with also the Italian dictionary set up? Lare2 It's​ doing the same to me when typing in Spanish. Stu I've finally made the switch from fleksy to gboard. Not the smoothest transition but there are some pluses. I just wish that when I turned off auto capitalization it worked for everything and not just the first letter of a sentence. Wouldn't mind if it knew that punctuation went at the end of the last word, even if I put a space already (like with commas). Would also be nice if when I added words to the dictionary it knew better when to suggest them or auto add them. Even when I add shortcuts in the dictionary I still have to type very deliberately, add apostrophes myself, etc. My name is…. A far lesser keyboard to Swiftkey. Mike Each have their pros and cons, I personally prefer Gboard for it's speed but Swiftkey has more features going for it. KlausWillSeeYouNow There's nothing fast about having to correct nearly every word Gboard predicts or swipes wrong. It will change correctly typed words, like "got," to stuff that can neither be contextually nor structurally related, like "hey." It was just like torture. I wanted to love Gboard but couldn't :( Aaron I want to love Gboard still. Just couldn't keep using Swiftkey after after the MS buyout. KlausWillSeeYouNow Why? It's not like it has Outlook built in or anything. Prezes Dyrektor Because Microsoft spying on us is evil, and Google or Facebook for example are fair and righteous /s Aaron IDK. My ever growing disdain for Windows has expanded to all Microsoft products. It's not necessarily rational. Brandon Giesing I'm pretty sure they mean speed as in it doesn't lag your whole device like SwiftKey does. Yeah you do waste more time technically because correcting stuff non-stop but Gboard is definitely faster than SwiftKey when it comes to not lagging. KlausWillSeeYouNow I've had the exact opposite experience. Everything about SwiftKey is faster. Gboard is a lagfest. Dmitry Stepanushkin Sure some people will use swipe input, but I prefer tap, especially for English keyboard, it's much faster for me, and swipe feels unreliable. Mike I try to Swype all the time and it just feels like I'm wasting time versus just tapping. Christopher Bement Swiping is way faster for me. tlogank Gboard kills the battery on my S7 for some reason. I get more alerts about it eating my battery up than any other app. Wish that wasn't the case because it's my favorite keyboard, but I can't keep using it as is. Carson Saldanha Try setting the theme to black AMOLED. I know that shouldn't be the fix and probably won't fully fix it, but it'll for sure help a little and will only take a while until you get used to the look. tlogank I'm getting notices for it even when I'm not using it. It's like doing stuff in the background or something. Carson Saldanha Strange. Have you tried a reinstall? Christopher Bement What have you tried in an attempt to fix it? tlogank Not much besides uninstalling and reinstalling it. Doesn't seem to help for more than a day. Druter Gboard is one of the most inaccurate keyboards on the Play store right now. Sometimes it almost seems as if it's trying to make typing as full of errors as possible. I have taken to reading everything two or three times to catch the errors and it still manages to sneak some in there. I do not have confidence enough in Gboard to type even short sentences and hit send without proofreading. If this is machine learning, the machine needs to go back to school Captain_Invisible Yup! It is by far the worst correction I have ever experienced in a keyboard. I can press all the right letters for a word (that makes complete sense) just to have it "correct" to another word... Michael Oghia The spell check isn't as good as it used to be either. obk88 just used it for about a week its very intriguing...using gifs, doing quick search from the keyboard and also used the translation option...but typing is just more effortless on swfitkey. Prediction is better on swiftkey, no suggestions in chrome or other apps is really annoying & gliding isnt as smooth...google is going in the right direction but this app still needs work...for now im back on swfitkey but keeping an eye on gboard for sure gv gboard may have machine learning algorithms, but they suck out loud. The ONLY thing it has going for it is launch speed. Other than that, it's far slower because it mis-predicts what word I'm swiping nearly 85% of the time. Seriously, I was swiping a text the other day and it didn't swipe a correct word. Eventually wound up thumbing the message just so I could talk! tehboogieman One of my biggest issues with Gboard is the inconsistency of whole word delete when swipe typing. I recently discovered there is a swipe backspace feature that I haven't read about anywhere that partially makes up for it, but I wish they would make the experience more consistent. If AP hasn't mentioned it yet it might be post worthy. I like a lot of the other improvements that Gboard has over the previous Google/AOSP keyboard. I've noticed a lot of improvements in text correction that takes a little getting used to, where it actually corrects groups of words or phrases in some situations. Still annoyed that I can't sync with my other devices just because I have one GSuite account EH101 The GSuite thing pisses me off. And it's not even the 'main' account. Martin AP wrote about the "delete whole words by sliding from backspace" thing back when it was introduced a year ago, but then the keyboard was still called Google Keyboard. Ailín Ó’S SwiftKey will remain my goto however. Nathan J And yet, they still can't tell the difference between to and too, or insist I meant CSV when I trace type "can." Rod Great post! Amarus Kh I've been trying Gboard for four weeks now since I got a new phone, but I just can't get myself to like it. I find it annoying that it doesn't show suggestions in many types of input fields (e.g. my email address in user fields, chrome search/address bar, etc.), swiping is unreliable most of the time, predictions are rarely relevant and don't seem to have improved with use, and so on. I'm going back to Swype. Dave i use texpand for emails h4rr4r Can machine learning add the rest of the keys to the keyboard? xphyle Swiftkey for the Win. Samson In German no sign of improvement so far. F4LL0U7 That's really great, but they still haven't fixed the bug where you can't open the emoji gallery when using a physical bluetooth keyboard. ChrisHigs Most of the time i find it pretty good, but occasionally *is* it's frustrating. Sometimes it won't suggest the word I want when I am *doing* swiping directly over the letters of the word but suggests *stone* some other *weird* word. Like cos. No chips. No I want chips. Grr. Cos. No again. Cos cos cos cos cos cos. What I was trying to type was "chops" but it won't let me. Surrey Street Surrey Surrey Street Surrey. Why won't it recognise "suet". Flip, grr, flip, no, flop *send* seems another tricky *I've* one. I'm not going over the i but it suggests flip instead of flop half the time. This is all *speed* swiped on gboard and the asterisks are incorrect suggestions it made. bekifft Type them out, and drag the incorrect suggestions to the trash can. It should learn. The more you accept the incorrect corrections the more it will reinforce them. May want to clear all learned words and start over. ChrisHigs Thanks. I didn't know you could drag suggestions to delete them. I've just been playing with swiping some of those words again and making sure it's using the correct one and it's definitely behaving better. Like chop. I can now swipe chop and chip without it being confused. And flop. Flop flop flop. And flip. Yup. Handling them better now. Shame there's no way to manually type in a correction or see a longer list of words. bekifft You can't explicitly correct a particular word as far as I can tell, but if you remove the auto suggestion it is supposed to learn intelligently. I guess this is the future, we have to teach the machines like children and hope they grow up to be good. Martin Now if only Gboard could understand that when I type "har" ("have" in Swedish), I don't mean "här" or "hår" ("here" and "hair", respectively). Had I been using an English keyboard layout it would have been understandable, but with a Swedish layout Å and Ä are separate keys on the opposite side of the keyboard, meaning that I really, really didn't go anywhere near those letters. SwiftKey had the same problem, but fixed it many years ago. MHS I'm Danish, and with Swiftkey you can even change layout of the English keyboard to the same as Danish (or Swedish in your case). That way there's no language switching at all. Kevin I'd consider gboard among the worst for autocorrect. Example: I type "if I spell" googles three auto corrects from left to right is spell, spelling and spelled. When is "if I spelling" ever right? And why is that center? Swiftkey however, from left to right; spelled, spell, and spell it. All improved and in an order that makes the most sense. xyz And a Happy Holi to you too, machine. D.Smithee I like Gboard--I really do. But it's got too many niggling problems for me to leave Swiftkey. Like not putting a space after a comma or period. Like the keyboard itself being too small for my hands. Like the word sync feature being NOWHERE near as good as Swiftkey. But it's getting better with every iteration--so maybe one day...

Here are a few ways machine learning has improved Gboard Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/24 4:33pm PDTMay 24, 2017 38 Plus 1 on G+ 113 Share on Facebook 127 Share on Twitter Total Shares278 Applications Google Videos Google has been improving Gboard with the same type of tools it uses for speech recognition: machine learning. The budding technology is rapidly becoming a ubiquitous method for improving results and performance. If a network can be trained to accurately accomplish something in a performant way, odds are you'll see it introduced to any product it can be applied to. Gboard and text-input as a whole are no different, and we are reaping the benefits of improved corrections and predictions every time we swipe out a low-accuracy message to a friend. But how do these improvements work? This is going to be a pretty technical post, and I'm going to do my best to simplify things to a level where everyone can enjoy the subject. All of this is based on a recent Google Research blog post. If you are really into machine learning and you already know what every term I might use means, the source link is probably the best place for you to learn about the cool new stuff in Gboard. If, however, you think you might want a few of the concepts or terms explained, then this article might be the place for you. Google's latest research blog post is all about one thing: Gboard. The authors talk about some of the new features that were shown off at I/O, like the transliteration tools for typing in a language you might only have a phonetic familiarity with. But the biggest things discussed in the article relate to how input is determined, and the models and math that determine which swipes equate to which words, and how to most accurately correct mistakes. The two solutions Google has found revolve around its neural spatial models for processing input, and finite-state transducers for state progression to accurately determine content. These sound like complex ideas, but their cleverness can be explained. Input Neural spatial models are just a fancy way of saying machine learning applied to any space. For instance, the physical Gboard keyboard layout itself. When we type, we sometimes type wrong. And when we swipe, we sometimes swipe wrong. I might have meant to drag over "P" for this word, but I only made it to O. That's where these neural spatial models come in handy. They are able to determine probabilities for which letters you meant to hit based on physical proximity of input, as well as predictive models based on trained corrections. Originally, Gboard used a Gaussian model, combed with a set of simple rules. That's a fancy way of saying it used physical proximity in a sort of bell-curve out from a given key, combined with a basic understanding of certain common errors. The developers have replaced the older Gaussian and rule-based model with an LSTM, or long short-term memory model, trained by a CTC, or connectionist temporal classification. Big somewhat scary acronyms, but they're actually pretty simple ideas. A long short-term memory is a particular kind of neural net ideal for use in applications of intermittent or unknown event/time latencies, and Google has previously used these for speech recognition, the Google Assistant, and Google Translate. A connectionist temporal classification is a specific method of training a neural network. After all, a neural network is nothing without data to derive weighted triggers and values from. In this case, it means segmenting data input to the network by time and allowing the network to retroactively refer to input, states, and output before and after the current set. To further simplify, it means referring to data at many stages of analysis from multiple periods of time, increasing the value of context in the network's training. To pull data for training, Google used data sets comprised of information collected when users opt-in to share snippets, and set reverted corrections and suggestions as negative signals, and accepted corrections or suggestions as positive. To help visualize how it might work, we have this image. In the above, the left represents individual data points from the word "could" as swiped on Gboard. The right is a normalized temporal data for the same swiped input. By being able to refer to the probable center of an input, in temporal context with inputs that came before and after, we can tell that the overall path means "Could" even if we might not have hit a couple of letters quite right. Google was further able to adapt some of its speech recognition tools and data and apply it to corrections and suggestions in Gboard, optimizing things over iterations with a heavy dose of Tensorflow to increase the speed of analysis and output and decrease the number of errors. All that is well and good, but Google can also leverage the rules of a language to enhance predictions. As a basic example, consider: If you tapped O-T instead of I-T, Gboard can look at its dictionary and determine that "OT" isn't something you are likely to input, but that the similar "IT" is a word. Furthermore, "I" is physically close to "O," so you probably meant "IT." Easy. Well, Google is able to do a similar but improved sort thing via what is called a finite-state transducer. Processing To vastly over-simplify, a finite-state transducer, in this case, means an order of operations for processing input. The operational flow above shows the various stages of potential input for the words "I," "I've," and "If." In this image, input at each stage comes before the ":" (with ε representing nothing as either input or output), and potential outputs are shown after the ":" as they each become logical. So we start having input the letter "i." From the top path we can see, if there is no additional input, then "I" is the correct output. If an apostrophe or space follows, followed by the letter "v," then "I've" is the likely output. If the letter "f" follows, then "If" is the likely output. The final two flows at the bottom return to start. You can think of it as just a series of rules for input and output. Google is able to use these same tools at other scales. For instance, developers can create these logical chains for whole words and their contexts, combined with the spatial models above and statistical likelihoods for possible inputs. These tools also apply to the transliteration features that were shown off at I/O. By implementing those same workflows and networks towards phonetically spelled input, it can guess what characters or words in another language you might mean. For anyone that might speak a language, but not know how to spell it, that's pretty cool. Unfortunately, if you can't read the language, you aren't really in a position to know if what it's typing is right or wrong, but it's still a useful tool. Output Gboard and machine learning are both pretty fantastically interesting and complex subjects. I hope our simplification of the tools behind it has helped you understand a bit more behind how it all works. It's useful to have knowledge about how the things we use on a daily basis work, not just in an abstract sense for intellectual fulfillment, but to provide us with a base for troubleshooting when things might go wrong. Now when GBoard makes seemingly odd recommendations, you might have a small idea as to why.

It's also buggy and crashy as hell. I switched to SwiftKey and haven't looked back. elijahblake it is very, very, very, bad at predicting correct words.. I do miss swiftkey sometimes. I guess i'm just hanging in there hoping the gboard starts learning. Just today instead of "this" it put "thoe" Dennis Ulijn I accidentally typed htought and it corrected it to brought instead of thought... Like... Why?! dimm0k I've mentioned this before... prior to the change of name to Gboard when it was Google Keyboard, the prediction was actually decent! since the name change however I agree that the prediction has been pretty crappy! words that I've typed pretty often still get mistaken for some other random word that doesn't even work in the sentence I'm typing out! JD I'm not the only one the noticed. That since the GBoard change it's turned to shit. When it was Google Keyboard it was neck and neck with Swiftkey David Thoren That's interesting.. I've never really used the prediction to type with, I just swipe through without looking, so I can't really speak to that.. But I have never seen Gboard crash or even get unstable. KlausWillSeeYouNow Gboard is totally unstable on my LG V20. Maybe it's just something specific to my device – but only recent versions of Gboard have had this issue for me. I miss the days of Google Keyboard, a stable product that actually worked. gv Haven't had any stability problems with g'board; don't think it's even crashed once on my axon7. But then again, it doesn't work worth a damn either, so is that really such an accomplishment? KlausWillSeeYouNow Yeah. Amen. Sounds like you and I should have a beer sometime. We clearly feel the same about Gboard. gv You can apply all the fancy machine learning you want, doesn't change that gv is total shit at predicting swiped words... it's so bad that I've gone back to swype despite it being a resource hog and slow. My favorite thing is you'll swipe a word, and gv will take a guess and be really wrong. So you'll back over it, swipe it again and gv will guess the EXACT SAME WORD. So you'll back over it, swipe it again, and gv will now be so sure that it won't offer *any* alternative suggestions (even though the alternative suggestions were also wrong) the third time. Machine learning, my ass! Machine stupidity; if it wasn't the correct word the first or second time you can be damn sure it's not the correct word the third time! So then you type in the word you actually want, and next sentence you need the same word. Idiot gv then suggests the original word AGAIN when you swipe it. Machine learning, my ass! At least swype is smart enough to know that if you just used a word it didn't swype in correctly, next time you swype something close to that (even if you didn't permanently add it to the dictionary) that's likely the word you wanted! KlausWillSeeYouNow AMEN! PREACH! I second this. It's so annoying. You said it better than I ever could, pal. Whatever Gboard's doing, it isn't working. Carson Saldanha I'm even on the beta on my 2014 Nexus 6 and it's running just fine--no crashes or anything. blahmoomoo If they can one day figure out when I mean to say "if" or "of", I'll be happy. It feels like less of a problem recently, but it still happens sometimes... Lare2 The problem I have with Gboard is that when you write on two languages and forget to change the language, over the time, it will start suggesting words on the wrong language. Rod This. On the other hand, Swiftkey handles languages nicely. h4rr4r It does this to me constantly. What I hate is that enabling a language for this requires adding its keyboard. For languages with the same alphabet but different layout it is really annoying. big_al77 I love gboard. Best keyboard for a while now Miku is Best Vocaloid I started using it as soon as they added bilingual prediction. Ha hecho mi vida mucho más fácil.

Can't it understand that I'm writing in Italian, with also the Italian dictionary set up? Lare2 It's​ doing the same to me when typing in Spanish. Stu I've finally made the switch from fleksy to gboard. Not the smoothest transition but there are some pluses. I just wish that when I turned off auto capitalization it worked for everything and not just the first letter of a sentence. Wouldn't mind if it knew that punctuation went at the end of the last word, even if I put a space already (like with commas). Would also be nice if when I added words to the dictionary it knew better when to suggest them or auto add them. Even when I add shortcuts in the dictionary I still have to type very deliberately, add apostrophes myself, etc. My name is…. A far lesser keyboard to Swiftkey. Mike Each have their pros and cons, I personally prefer Gboard for it's speed but Swiftkey has more features going for it. KlausWillSeeYouNow There's nothing fast about having to correct nearly every word Gboard predicts or swipes wrong. It will change correctly typed words, like "got," to stuff that can neither be contextually nor structurally related, like "hey." It was just like torture. I wanted to love Gboard but couldn't :( Aaron I want to love Gboard still. Just couldn't keep using Swiftkey after after the MS buyout. KlausWillSeeYouNow Why? It's not like it has Outlook built in or anything. Prezes Dyrektor Because Microsoft spying on us is evil, and Google or Facebook for example are fair and righteous /s Aaron IDK. My ever growing disdain for Windows has expanded to all Microsoft products. It's not necessarily rational. Brandon Giesing I'm pretty sure they mean speed as in it doesn't lag your whole device like SwiftKey does. Yeah you do waste more time technically because correcting stuff non-stop but Gboard is definitely faster than SwiftKey when it comes to not lagging. KlausWillSeeYouNow I've had the exact opposite experience. Everything about SwiftKey is faster. Gboard is a lagfest. Dmitry Stepanushkin Sure some people will use swipe input, but I prefer tap, especially for English keyboard, it's much faster for me, and swipe feels unreliable. Mike I try to Swype all the time and it just feels like I'm wasting time versus just tapping. Christopher Bement Swiping is way faster for me. tlogank Gboard kills the battery on my S7 for some reason. I get more alerts about it eating my battery up than any other app. Wish that wasn't the case because it's my favorite keyboard, but I can't keep using it as is. Carson Saldanha Try setting the theme to black AMOLED. I know that shouldn't be the fix and probably won't fully fix it, but it'll for sure help a little and will only take a while until you get used to the look. tlogank I'm getting notices for it even when I'm not using it. It's like doing stuff in the background or something. Carson Saldanha Strange. Have you tried a reinstall? Christopher Bement What have you tried in an attempt to fix it? tlogank Not much besides uninstalling and reinstalling it. Doesn't seem to help for more than a day. Druter Gboard is one of the most inaccurate keyboards on the Play store right now. Sometimes it almost seems as if it's trying to make typing as full of errors as possible. I have taken to reading everything two or three times to catch the errors and it still manages to sneak some in there. I do not have confidence enough in Gboard to type even short sentences and hit send without proofreading. If this is machine learning, the machine needs to go back to school Captain_Invisible Yup! It is by far the worst correction I have ever experienced in a keyboard. I can press all the right letters for a word (that makes complete sense) just to have it "correct" to another word... Michael Oghia The spell check isn't as good as it used to be either. obk88 just used it for about a week its very intriguing...using gifs, doing quick search from the keyboard and also used the translation option...but typing is just more effortless on swfitkey. Prediction is better on swiftkey, no suggestions in chrome or other apps is really annoying & gliding isnt as smooth...google is going in the right direction but this app still needs work...for now im back on swfitkey but keeping an eye on gboard for sure gv gboard may have machine learning algorithms, but they suck out loud. The ONLY thing it has going for it is launch speed. Other than that, it's far slower because it mis-predicts what word I'm swiping nearly 85% of the time. Seriously, I was swiping a text the other day and it didn't swipe a correct word. Eventually wound up thumbing the message just so I could talk! tehboogieman One of my biggest issues with Gboard is the inconsistency of whole word delete when swipe typing. I recently discovered there is a swipe backspace feature that I haven't read about anywhere that partially makes up for it, but I wish they would make the experience more consistent. If AP hasn't mentioned it yet it might be post worthy. I like a lot of the other improvements that Gboard has over the previous Google/AOSP keyboard. I've noticed a lot of improvements in text correction that takes a little getting used to, where it actually corrects groups of words or phrases in some situations. Still annoyed that I can't sync with my other devices just because I have one GSuite account EH101 The GSuite thing pisses me off. And it's not even the 'main' account. Martin AP wrote about the "delete whole words by sliding from backspace" thing back when it was introduced a year ago, but then the keyboard was still called Google Keyboard. Ailín Ó’S SwiftKey will remain my goto however. Nathan J And yet, they still can't tell the difference between to and too, or insist I meant CSV when I trace type "can." Rod Great post! Amarus Kh I've been trying Gboard for four weeks now since I got a new phone, but I just can't get myself to like it. I find it annoying that it doesn't show suggestions in many types of input fields (e.g. my email address in user fields, chrome search/address bar, etc.), swiping is unreliable most of the time, predictions are rarely relevant and don't seem to have improved with use, and so on. I'm going back to Swype. Dave i use texpand for emails h4rr4r Can machine learning add the rest of the keys to the keyboard? xphyle Swiftkey for the Win. Samson In German no sign of improvement so far. F4LL0U7 That's really great, but they still haven't fixed the bug where you can't open the emoji gallery when using a physical bluetooth keyboard. ChrisHigs Most of the time i find it pretty good, but occasionally *is* it's frustrating. Sometimes it won't suggest the word I want when I am *doing* swiping directly over the letters of the word but suggests *stone* some other *weird* word. Like cos. No chips. No I want chips. Grr. Cos. No again. Cos cos cos cos cos cos. What I was trying to type was "chops" but it won't let me. Surrey Street Surrey Surrey Street Surrey. Why won't it recognise "suet". Flip, grr, flip, no, flop *send* seems another tricky *I've* one. I'm not going over the i but it suggests flip instead of flop half the time. This is all *speed* swiped on gboard and the asterisks are incorrect suggestions it made. bekifft Type them out, and drag the incorrect suggestions to the trash can. It should learn. The more you accept the incorrect corrections the more it will reinforce them. May want to clear all learned words and start over. ChrisHigs Thanks. I didn't know you could drag suggestions to delete them. I've just been playing with swiping some of those words again and making sure it's using the correct one and it's definitely behaving better. Like chop. I can now swipe chop and chip without it being confused. And flop. Flop flop flop. And flip. Yup. Handling them better now. Shame there's no way to manually type in a correction or see a longer list of words. bekifft You can't explicitly correct a particular word as far as I can tell, but if you remove the auto suggestion it is supposed to learn intelligently. I guess this is the future, we have to teach the machines like children and hope they grow up to be good. Martin Now if only Gboard could understand that when I type "har" ("have" in Swedish), I don't mean "här" or "hår" ("here" and "hair", respectively). Had I been using an English keyboard layout it would have been understandable, but with a Swedish layout Å and Ä are separate keys on the opposite side of the keyboard, meaning that I really, really didn't go anywhere near those letters. SwiftKey had the same problem, but fixed it many years ago. MHS I'm Danish, and with Swiftkey you can even change layout of the English keyboard to the same as Danish (or Swedish in your case). That way there's no language switching at all. Kevin I'd consider gboard among the worst for autocorrect. Example: I type "if I spell" googles three auto corrects from left to right is spell, spelling and spelled. When is "if I spelling" ever right? And why is that center? Swiftkey however, from left to right; spelled, spell, and spell it. All improved and in an order that makes the most sense. xyz And a Happy Holi to you too, machine. D.Smithee I like Gboard--I really do. But it's got too many niggling problems for me to leave Swiftkey. Like not putting a space after a comma or period. Like the keyboard itself being too small for my hands. Like the word sync feature being NOWHERE near as good as Swiftkey. But it's getting better with every iteration--so maybe one day...

 YOUR E-MAIL VERIFICATION CODE The Ministry of Finance has charged Google with a penalty of TL 300 million ($84 million) on the grounds that the company issued invoices for its advertising sales over Ireland and caused tax losses to Turkey. The Treasury Department's Tax Inspection Board reached a conclusion during routine audits into the world's largest search engine, Google. Tax inspectors found that despite the fact that Google has been conducting its online advertising activities from its Turkish office in Tekfen Plaza in Levent, Istanbul, the company issued the advertising sales bills for Turkish customers through Ireland and causing a huge tax loss to Turkey. U.S.-based multinational corporations such as Apple, Microsoft, Google and Twitter have allegedly carried out their commercial activities outside the U.S. through the companies they established in Ireland in order to evade taxes. The international press occasionally covers the situation, which has caused serious tension between the European Union (EU) and the U.S., especially now that the tax battles have escalated. It is known that these companies, which also operate in Turkey, have transferred their commercial income obtained from Turkey to Ireland, even though they have sales offices and serious commercial organizations in the country. After detecting that Google issued the invoices for its advertising sales over Ireland, tax inspectors reported that Google had an office as part of Article 5 of the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement signed in 2011 between Ireland and Turkey. Google, which has been operating in Turkey since 2006 in the field of online advertising as its main activity, has also gained ad revenue through YouTube since 2014. In their 2015 review, inspectors proposed a corporate tax of approximately TL 300 million and VAT on behalf of Google for the periods of 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013. It was later learned that Google did not appeal to the Tax Court for penalties, and that it benefited from tax amnesty. Google paid the said penalties within the scope of the related law.

The app has received a couple of few exciting updates in the last few months. A new feature spotted by 9to5google is hitting the app in the coming months. This new feature called Archive, will let you remove those private images from the main Photo tab without getting rid of them from your library. Not everyone has seen the new Archive feature yet—and the last time I checked, it wasn’t there. However, the report went on to say that the Archive option is placed in the drawer above Trash. You can access Archive from the overflow menu of any picture—and of course, it comes with a tutorial popping up the first time you open it. 9to5google also reported that Archive will remain in albums and search results. Archive has already gone live on Android, with no date set for the web and iOS versions. However, the possibility of having the feature extended to the iOS and web version in the coming days is high—and probably won’t be long. Google Photos recently announced a major milestone—it now has 500 million active users—and that in itself is an achievement. It is indeed a great achievement when you consider the number of apps providing almost similar services these days. Of course, one has to take into account the fact that the name Google always rings a bell; but the fact that not every app from the Mountain View California-based company has been that successful. Along with announcing its 500 million milestone, Google also introduced three new features last week to make sharing and printing on the app easier and interesting. Everyone, and that includes you, will soon be able to order printed books of photos when using the app. You will also be able to share all photos automatically with a significant order, get automated suggestions about what to share based on clues. One of the features added is called Suggested Sharing, a new feature that will help you share and receive all those important photos—and yes, it saves you the stress of having to manually do it by yourself. This feature is based on Google’s machine learning technology—and will remind you to share, and automatically select the right photos, suggest who to send it to according to who is in the photos. Suggested Sharing is easy to use, simply tap the send button, and your friends and family will see all your photos. They will also get a reminder from the app to share their photos too. “Now all the photos of that birthday dinner or weekend trip are in one place, including—and especially—the photos you didn’t take,” said Anil Sabharwal, Vice President Google Photos.

Photograph: Lucy Nicholson/Reuters Google Accused of underpaying women, Google says it's too expensive to get wage data Officials said it was too financially burdensome and logistically challenging to hand over salary records that the government requested in discrimination case Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Sam Levin in San Francisco @SamTLevin email Friday 26 May 2017 17.49 EDT Google argued that it was too financially burdensome and logistically challenging to compile and hand over salary records that the government has requested, sparking a strong rebuke from the US Department of Labor (DoL), which has accused the Silicon Valley firm of underpaying women. Google accused of 'extreme' gender pay discrimination by US labor department Read more Google officials testified in federal court on Friday that it would have to spend up to 500 hours of work and $100,000 to comply with investigators’ ongoing demands for wage data that the DoL believes will help explain why the technology corporation appears to be systematically discriminating against women. Noting Google’s nearly $28bn annual income as one of the most profitable companies in the US, DoL attorney Ian Eliasoph scoffed at the company’s defense, saying, “Google would be able to absorb the cost as easy as a dry kitchen sponge could absorb a single drop of water.” The tense exchanges in a small San Francisco courtroom emerged in the final day of testimony in the most high-profile government trial to date surrounding the intensifying debate about the wage gap and gender discrimination in the tech industry. The DoL first publicly accused Google of “systemic compensation disparities” during a hearing in April, saying a preliminary inquiry had found that the Mountain View tech firm underpays women across positions. The current court battle stems from the DoL’s lawsuit filed against Google in January, accusing the company of violating federal laws by refusing to provide salary history and contact information of employees as part of a government audit. As a federal contractor, Google is required to comply with equal opportunity laws and allow investigators to review records. Labor officials have said they uncovered pay disparities in a 2015 snapshot of salaries and that investigators needed an earlier snapshot and compensation history of the employees to better understand the wage gap. The agency has also argued that it needs contact information of employees so it can conduct confidential interviews. Google would be able to absorb the cost as easy as a dry kitchen sponge could absorb a single drop of water DoL attorney Ian Eliasoph “This is obviously a very time-consuming and burdensome project,” said Lisa Barnett Sween, one of Google’s attorneys, claiming that the company has already worked 2,300 hours at a cost of nearly $500,000 to partially comply with the government’s demands, which she argued were broad and unconstitutional. “Our courts must act to check this abuse of power.” Google has vehemently denied the claims that it underpays women, claiming that it has closed its gender pay gap globally and that in the US it provides equal pay across races. Google has also argued that the DoL’s data request would violate the privacy of employees and fourth amendment rights against unreasonable search and seizure. In one revealing exchange, Frank Wagner, the company’s director of compensation, admitted in court that if women are paid less than men in the same positions, those salary disparities can persist even if the employees perform at the same level. Asked about a hypothetical, Wagner explained that if a female employee starts at a lower salary than a male colleague in the same job at Google, she may continue to make less even if they both excel in their first year and score the same on evaluations. Wagner claimed that eventually, their wages would likely be adjusted to match each other: “There would be convergence over time.” Eliasoph, the DoL attorney, said that it was outrageous for Google to argue that historical salary data was irrelevant to the government’s audit, considering it is widely understood that discriminatory wages lead to continued disparities as women advance in their careers. “This claim requires putting one’s head in the sand with respect to 30 years of law on pay discrimination.” Kristin Zmrhal, Google’s senior legal operations manager, also testified that the process of compiling data for the DoL has required engineers, lawyers and employees across departments to build new systems, conduct extensive quality reviews of files, redact documents and complete other complex tasks. “It became too burdensome,” she said, noting Google was forced to hire a third-party vendor to help. “The team was bogged down.” Eliasoph pointed out that Google has consistently earned millions in lucrative government contracts and has recently announced “with great public fanfare” that it invested $150m in diversity initiatives. “Google cannot claim ... that it now has no money to comply with a federal agency seeking to ensure compliance with equal opportunity laws on behalf of the public.” He also claimed that Google, with more than 21,000 employees, was trying to present itself as “too big to comply” and that the company should not be able to skirt anti-discrimination laws just because it is large and has a complex compensation model: “Google takes routine requests and makes them sound onerous by emphasizing the number of people involved.” Revealed: Google tried to block media coverage of gender discrimination case Read more Sween asserted that Google has complied with the “overwhelming majority” of the government’s demands, adding, “The agency has little if any regard for the fourth amendment rights of its contractors.” Earlier this month, the tech firm’s lawyers also unsuccessfully argued that the case should be dismissed altogether, claiming that a DoL official may have violated ethics rules by talking to the Guardian about the federal investigation. In that interview in April, regional solicitor Janet Herold said that the initial data suggested that “discrimination against women in Google is quite extreme, even in this industry”. Surveys have repeatedly found that women are often paid less than men for the same jobs across Silicon Valley. An account of sexual harassment at Uber earlier this year has also sparked a widespread debate about misogyny and misconduct in tech. Google is one of three powerful Silicon Valley firms to face DoL lawsuits related to discrimination claims over the last year.

[Marco Paköeningrat/Flickr] Languages: Français | Deutsch Comments Print The European Commission on Tuesday (2 May) unveiled a proposal that could significantly expand its powers to request access to sensitive corporate data as a way to enforce EU single market rules or to inform new pieces of legislation. Companies have voiced opposition to the proposal, arguing it would force them to disclose “sensitive” business information to EU authorities upon request. If the proposal goes through, firms which refuse to comply could be fined up to 1% of their turnover from the previous year, on top of a possible fine of up to 5% of daily turnover. The proposed Single Market Information Tool is part of a legislative package designed to improve the functioning of the EU’s single market. In “targeted” cases, when neither national authorities or the companies involved have voluntarily provided the information, the Commission would be able to request the data directly from the firms. Officials explained this would be needed only in a very limited number of cases, around 1% of the total. Asking Google for its algorithm One example is the use of unjustified geo-blocking practices by online services. Some of the information needed to regulate these services should be based “on detailed price and cost data which only service providers possess”, according to EU legislators. MEPs want to lift online geoblocking for Spotify and ebooks MEPs in the Internal Market Committee approved geoblocking rules that could open up access to music streaming sites and ebook sales across the EU, going beyond the European Commission’s proposal and setting up a fight with industry groups. Asked if valuable corporate secrets, like Google’s search algorithm, could also fall under the scope of the new information tool, an official confirmed that it could be the case “but seems highly implausible”. “Asking for Google’s search algorithm could theoretically fall under its scope, but seems highly implausible, an official explained.” The European Commission says it needs deeper inside knowledge of some industries in order to inform new EU laws. If legislation is based on incomplete information, it could potentially “harm” the industries concerned, it argues, saying that even a marginal improvement in the level of detail could have “enormous benefits” for an entire industry. In the case of geo-blocking, 1% of revenues of copyright-intensive industries adds up to more than €9 billion. Three-step approval Limits would be placed on the Commission’s new discretionary powers, along with a three-step approval process. When a company does not reply to a request, or when the response is unsatisfactory, Brussels could insist a second time that if there is no response, if the answer comes late or is unsatisfactory, it could then ask for sanctions. European Commission officials played down the risk of penalties, saying that the executive already has the authority to request information from companies directly in competition cases. The Commission has fined various companies in the past for failing to cooperate or providing misleading information on merger cases. Tetra Laval, a Swiss-Swedish carton packaging company, was fined €90,000 in 2004, and Deutsche BP €35,000 in 2002. No company has been sanctioned since merger rules were strengthened in 2004. However, the executive is investigating Facebook for providing misleading information on its buyout of WhatsApp. Facebook gave misleading information during WhatsApp buyout, Commission says The European Commission could fine Facebook up to €170 million after it accused the social media giant with providing misleading information during its acquisition of WhatsApp. The Commission expanded its powers to request information to state aid cases in 2013, on the back of revelations regarding the ‘sweetheart’ deals EU governments sometimes offer multinationals. But the executive has so far only used its new competences in state aid cases against Starbucks and Fiat. During preliminary discussions in Council working groups, member states asked for a say in the process. As a result, the draft proposal foresees that the executive would notify every request for information from companies. However, governments would have access to the information only if the process ends up in an infringement procedure before the European Court of Justice and only if the information is not confidential. Member states were also concerned that the proposal could be burdensome for the private sector. The European Commission argued that it would not use it indiscriminately. It will be a “very infrequent” tool, an official assured, saying small companies with less than ten employees or a turnover below €10 million will be excluded. The Commission also stressed that the information provided would be treated confidentially, applying the same practices used in competition cases. ‘Serious concerns’ But despite the executive’s guarantees, the private sector remained critical. “We have serious concerns,” said the Director General of BusinessEurope, Markus Beyrer. In a statement, the organisation said that the new information tool could lead to “unacceptable risks regarding highly sensitive business information,” without clear justification or explanation of how the European Commission intends to use it. BusinessEurope and Eurochambres, the umbrella organisation for small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe, agreed that this new instrument would represent an additional burden to companies. Eurochambres described the proposal as “misdirected”, saying member states are to blame for outstanding barriers in the single market, not companies. “The Commission is kidding itself if it thinks that a lack of commercial data is the root cause of single market malfunctions. It is member state administrations that regularly fall short in implementing requirements,” said Arnaldo Abruzzini, CEO of Eurochambres. Commission takes legal action against seven EU countries over VW scandal Seven countries have broken EU law for refusing to sanction Volkswagen after it used illegal software to manipulate its vehicles’ emissions tests. “The recent struggle for the Commission to get reliable data from car manufacturers about their emissions practices are a case in point. This could be a decisive tool to tilt the scale in favour of consumers and the companies who play by the rules,” said Monique Goyens, director general of the European Consumer Organisation (BEUC). Positions Elżbieta Bieńkowska, Commissioner for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs,  said: "The new Single Market Information Tool will further contribute to the Commission's enforcement work, so that citizens' Single Market rights are duly respected and EU businesses face fewer barriers when scaling up and entering new markets." Background As part of the package to improve the functioning of the single market, the European Commission also presented a  proposal for a Single Digital Gateway. This portal will help people and companies to have easier access to information and online administrative procedures and assistance services. Any procedure currently available online for domestic users will be accessible to users from other Member States. A total of 13 key administrative procedures will have to be made available online, including requests for a birth certificate, to register a car, start a business or register for social security benefits.

This time, researchers say they have found a new class of Android exploits altogether, that they call Cloak and Dagger. The reason for the name is that the exploits operate silently in the background, without the user ever knowing about their existence. Discovered by researchers at the at the University of California Santa Barbara and the Georgia Institute of Technology, the Cloak and Dagger attacks user two sets of permissions on Android. The first is the System Alert Window, which is also known as 'draw on top', allowing apps to create overlays or draw on top of other apps and the Android interface. The second is Bind Accessibility Service, known as 'a11y', which allows uses the numerous accessibility services available on Android to help people with sight and other challenges. Using either or both of these permissions, a malicious app could make users fall for clickjacking. This is a concept where a malicious app shows users one interface, which actually masks another interface below. For example, users could be shown an innocuous questionnaire, but below it, app permissions could be being toggled instead without users' knowledge. Unsurprisingly, these two permissions allow all sorts of attacks to exploit users. "These attacks allow a malicious app to completely control the UI feedback loop and take over the device - without giving the user a chance to notice the malicious activity," the description of the Cloak and Dagger attacks reads on a dedicated website. Notably, these attacks even affect all the latest versions of Google's mobile platform, including Android 7.1.2 Nougat, and require merely two permissions. Alarmingly, the System Alert Window or 'draw on top' permission is not required to be explicitly granted by the user when an app is installed via Google Play. To make things worse, as we explained above, if an malicious app with the Draw on Top permission is installed, it could easily scam a user into granting it the Bind Accessibility Service permission. If you are concerned already, wait till you hear the worst part, these vulnerabilities have not been fixed till now. While these researchers first talked to Google around 9 months back and some vulnerabilities were fixed over months with updates, some of them are still present in the latest version of the platform as the tools involved in the exploit are also required by some applications, as pointed out in a report by Android Police. Overlays can always prove to be a security threat and this is why an overlay notification was added with Android Marshmallow as well. However, it was removed with Android Nougat, Android Police nots. The invisible Grid attack, which makes use of these vulnerabilities, can enable keystroke recording that can give away users password and other sensitive data to the hijackers as well. In a statement to Engadget, Google has responded to the Cloak and Dagger attacks, and said, "We've been in close touch with the researchers and, as always, we appreciate their efforts to help keep our users safer. We have updated Google Play Protect -- our security services on all Android devices with Google Play -- to detect and prevent the installation of these apps. Prior to this report, we had already built new security protections into Android O that will further strengthen our protection from these issues, moving forward." However, the researchers say that they were able to get malicious app approved from the store and that it is still available on Google Play. Thus, until Android O comes along, users don't have much they can do to avoid being trapped, beyond regular security practices. Install apps only from trusted sources, don't install random apps, and, keep a close watch on what permissions an app is asking for.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Apple is working on a ‘Neural Engine’ to improve AI in iOS devices Image Source: Apple Jacob Siegal @JacobSiegal May 26th, 2017 at 5:07 PM Share Tweet Apple is developing a processor dedicated to AI-related tasks, according to a new report from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. Gurman’s source says that the chip is known internally as the ‘Apple Neural Engine,’ and that it will be used to improve the way that Apple’s myriad devices respond to requests that typically require human intelligence, including facial recognition and speech recognition. Don't Miss: New report reaffirms the iPhone 8’s most exciting new feature The report claims that Apple is in a rush to catch up with its competition at Amazon and Google when it comes to artificial intelligence. Although Siri was the first virtual assistant to reach the mainstream, it has since been surpassed by the like of Alexa and Google Assistant, both of which have become even more ubiquitous with the release of smart speakers like Amazon Echo and Google Home. An AI-enabled processor would help Cupertino, California-based Apple integrate more advanced capabilities into devices, particularly cars that drive themselves and gadgets that run augmented reality, the technology that superimposes graphics and other information onto a person’s view of the world. As it stands, Apple uses the main processor and the graphics chip to run virtually everything on its iOS devices, including AI processes. The Neural Engine would allow Apple to offload those processes onto a discreet module, freeing up the other chips and possibly improving battery life in the process. One source says that Apple will eventually implement the chip into its most popular devices, including the iPhone and iPad. The company has even begun testing new iPhone models with the Neural Engine, but it’s unclear if it will be ready in time for the launch of the iPhone 7s and iPhone 8 this fall. Depending on how far along the project is by next month, there’s a chance Apple will take some time at its annual WWDC conference to discuss it advancements in the AI field. The AI chip would join iOS 11 and and new MacBooks as the featured topics of discussion for the event, which starts on June 5th.

The campaign is named ‘browse against the machine’ and should change the domination of Google’s Chrome browser which currently holds a worldwide market share of about 60%. That is 4x times more than its second competitor, Firefox. Google’s domination of the browser market is making that its “influence on the internet economy and individuals is out of balance”, according to Mozilla’s Eric Petitt. He also argues that it provides Google more control over the web and way people use the web. The campaign ‘browse against the machine’ should change that. In the campaign Mozilla advertises 5 of Firefox’s biggest advantages, hoping it will make people switch from Chrome. The campaign underlines how Firefox uses less memory than Chrome, how Firefox provides users more control over your data and privacy, that Firefox is independent, that the browser isn’t developed by the largest advertising company in the world but instead by a, “non-profit organization whose mission is to preserve a healthy web in part by keeping corporate power in check”. “Some folks might interpret “browse against the machine” as a desperate cry, but it isn’t. Firefox grew in users last year and Mozilla is financially healthier now than it has ever been”, Petitt writes on the Mozilla website. “Mozilla has always put its independence ahead of maximizing profit. It is an imperfect world with Google’s search engine dominance, but we still remain the only independent alternative on the web today”, he concludes.

The G7 group issued an unprecedented order telling internet outfits like Google, Facebook and Twitter to “act urgently” in developing new tools to block violent content. The joint statement represented a significant win for Theresa May at her first G7 summit. The PM has led the charge against online terror, first as Home Secretary and then as Prime Minister – and now has other world leaders on her side. British officials said US President Donald Trump and new French President Emmanuel Macron proved key allies at the summit in Sicily, pressing other leaders to back the plan.

The G7 calls for communication service providers and social media companies to substantially increase their effort to address terrorist content. “We encourage the industry to act urgently in developing and sharing new technology and tools to improve the automatic detection of content promoting incitement to violence. And we commit to supporting industry efforts in this vein including the proposed industry-led forum for combating online extremism.” Donald Trump and Theresa May at the G7 summit in Sicily (Photo: Getty) The leaders also agreed to work harder to tackle pro-jihadi propaganda with their own pro-Western messages. The statement added: “We will support the promotion of alternative and positive narratives rooted in our common values. We will counter propaganda supporting terrorism.” Speaking afterwards, Mrs May said the commitment was a “significant” step forward. The PM said: “We will put our full weight behind the creation of this industry-led forum which will develop the technology and techniques that will be used to take material down. “I am very clear that we want this to be done more urgently and more rapidly than it is at the moment. It’s important that companies recognise their social responsibility. We need to work together to fight the evil of terrorism and no one can be in any doubt about what happened in Manchester of just how evil those terrorists are.” Theresa May has led the charge against online terror (Photo: Getty) Mrs May also revealed British jihadis fighting with Islamic State could be intercepted, arrested and jailed by security services in countries like Turkey as they try to return home. The PM urged fellow leaders to pool intelligence on homegrown jihadis with authorities in “third countries” they pass through while making their way back. Read More Jeremy Corbyn talks terror, Boris Johnson's 'monstrous' gaffe and manifesto maths: 5 things we learned on the election trail today The return of IS’s “foreign fighters” is one of the key threats faced by Western nations. It is feared the trickle of returning battle-hardened terrorists could soon become a flood as the terror group continues to lose ground in Iraq and Syria. Addressing leaders at a G7 session on counter-terrorism today, Mrs May said: “More of these fighters may try to return to their original country and pose a threat there. The G7 needs to share our expertise with countries foreign fighters travel through or fight in. We want to ensure those countries have the legal means to appropriately prosecute, extradite or deport.” British officials highlighted the case of London-born jihadi Aine Davis, arrested in Istanbul in 2015 after Turkish security tracked him on his way back from Syria. He was found guilty of being a senior member of a terrorist organisation and jailed for seven-and-a-half years. Mrs May told President Trump, President Macron and other leaders the case showed why intelligence on homegrown jihadis must be shared. The fight against ISIS has moved to the internet She said: “We need to securely share data on our foreign fighters, such as names and nationalities, so they can be spotted by different countries as they cross borders, and decisions made on whether they should be arrested.

When our allies find evidence, such as video or papers, of illegal activity involving foreign fighters, for example a Brit in a conflict zone, they should pass that to our authorities.” Twitter declined to comment directly but said during the reporting period of July 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016, a total of 376,890 accounts were suspended for violations related to the promotion of terrorism. The firm added: “We plan to share updates on our efforts to combat violent extremism by including them in this new section of our transparency report.” Video Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8Cancel Play now Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Politics Newsletter Follow @MirrorPolitics Subscribe to our Politics newsletterEnter emailSubscribe More On Google G7 summit Theresa May Donald Trump Middle East Syria Syria conflict Terrorism News all Most Read Most Recent LionsLions rescued from circus and flown to Africa to keep them 'safe' butchered in suspected witchcraft killing Male lions Jose and Liso were found with their heads severed and their paws hacked off for potions and charms London Bridge terror attackMan flees London Bridge terror attack still holding pint of beer in his hand - and Brits couldn't be more proud The image has been shared thousands of times, with Brits defending it as using "our dark humour helping us to cope" London Bridge terror attackFamily of London Bridge terrorist killed by police say 'we just want to grieve in peace' The 27-year-old attacker, currently identified only as 'Abz', lived in Barking, East London with his wife and two young children London Bridge terror attackFirst police officer at London Bridge attack "was rugby player who took on all terrorists until forced to ground" A British Transport Police officer stabbed during the London terror incident took on the knifemen armed only with his baton, and has been praised for his bravery London Bridge terror attackLondon Bridge terrorist 'ringleader' was former Underground and KFC worker who tried to brainwash kids in local park The 27-year-old attacker, currently identified only as 'Abz', lived in Barking, East London with his wife and two young children London Bridge terror attackCommuters face chaos around London Bridge as terror attack investigation continues Police said cordons put in place while officers carry out investigation work would remain "well into Monday" London Bridge terror attackFamily of London Bridge terrorist killed by police say 'we just want to grieve in peace' The 27-year-old attacker, currently identified only as 'Abz', lived in Barking, East London with his wife and two young children TerrorismSecurity barriers installed at London bridges after terror attack killed seven and injured 48 Many have questioned why barriers weren't installed after the Westminster attack General election pollsUK general election 2017 poll tracker: All the latest results as Conservatives battle Labour Polls are a crucial part of the election wallchart - even if they've got a bad rep.

Resold Pixel phones originally purchased from Project Fi are having their IMEIs blacklisted Richard Gao Follow View All Posts 2017/05/25 5:30am PDTMay 25, 2017 59 Plus 1 on G+ 150 Share on Facebook 58 Share on Twitter Total Shares267 Google News Pixel Pixel XL Project Fi Back in November, when the Pixel was slowly beginning to ship to customers, there were numerous reports of people getting their Google accounts banned for purchasing Pixel and Pixel XL devices with the intent to resell them. It turns out that this issue hasn't exactly been laid to rest, as it seems that Pixel phones purchased from Project Fi for this purpose are now getting blacklisted via their IMEI numbers. As an overview, people originally bought Pixels from both the Google Store and Project Fi to sell them to a New Hampshire-based reseller. Why New Hampshire, you may ask? There's no sales tax. Both parties here were supposed to make a profit, but Google ended up banning a ton of accounts for a violation of their terms of service.. Considering how important Google is in our lives (Gmail, Google Photos, YouTube, Play Store, etc.), a lot of people were obviously not happy. In the end, Google did restore many of these accounts, but it was obviously enough for a good scare. However, it seems that Google still hasn't completely forgiven people for violating their ToS. Kyle Bennett, the editor-in-chief and founder of the HardOCP website, had his Pixel XL's IMEI blacklisted just yesterday. IMEIs are typically blacklisted by carriers when phones are lost or stolen, but that's clearly not what happened here. Calling T-Mobile didn't do anything, as their staff told him that they could not reverse the blacklisting. His communication with Swappa support was more interesting, though; here's what they told him: "Sorry to hear of the complaints. We have seen a great number of Pixel devices becoming blacklisted the past two days. We are still trying to figure out why this has happened to so many devices. We are working to find out the cause of this widespread issue. It would be best for both of you to keep on top of Google and pressing them for an explanation. In one other case, I saw this morning Google agreed to send the buyer a replacement device so that might be an option to look into. Seller please work with the buyer and Google to see if they can get to the bottom of it." Kyle then contacted Google support, with the first representative claiming that he had simply received a spam message. When he showed a second rep how his IMEI had indeed been blacklisted via Swappa's ESN/IMEI checker (useful tool if you're buying a phone, by the way), he was told that his Pixel XL hadn't been reported as stolen, but that it had been originally purchased through Project Fi. Kyle was also once again told that his phone hadn't really been blacklisted, but a quick rescan of his IMEI in Swappa proved otherwise. His case was escalated to Project Fi's support team, but the customer service rep refused to give him a reference number and told him that he'd receive it via email. After contacting a third representative, Kyle was informed that his phone had indeed been blacklisted, but that Google wasn't responsible for doing so. This lends further credence to the Project Fi explanation, as it's the carrier and not the manufacturer that has the ability to blacklist devices. The situation is still ongoing, but that's all we know for now; we'll update with more information as we get it.

Okay. NeverrKnowsBest You can sell a Project Fi phone. You just buy them in bulk and try to make a profit off Project Fi. Stupid that the customer is being punished for this, though. Green Dog Is it clear that this is one of the phones that was bought in bulk from that retailer? From my reading, it was just a resold phone. I mean obviously, it's not happening to all phones, but the fact that it's still happening is a concern. NeverrKnowsBest The IMEIs are being linked to one particular reseller in New Hampshire. celestre Do you have more information than is present in the article on this? NeverrKnowsBest I'm just going off what the article said. I would love to read more, but I highly doubt they are just flipping the switch on every resold Project Fi phone. That just isn't very plausible, at least to my knowledge. datkidpatrick you misunderstood the article... they referenced a time where a bulk reseller's phones were black listed... but now it is happening to a bunch of random sellers that decided to sell the phone... Richard Gao The bulk reseller's phones weren't blacklisted at that time. It is entirely possible that these are the same phones. datkidpatrick i purchased mine straight from project fi... sold it 3 months ago and the seller told me the other day it was blacklisted... and yes my mistake.. the bulk resellers email's were blocked or something like that... Cael Did you pay off the phone before you sold it? datkidpatrick yes i did... Corey Kinard So they're punishing someone that fully paid for a device from you, who fully owned the device? They're legally allowed to just fully break something they've already sold and have no right to? This is worse than when carriers wouldn't unlock phones... datkidpatrick im still giving google the benefit of doubt that it was a mistake... they just need to fix it PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ You'll easily win in small claims court if you have to refund and take the phone back. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ What kind of financing plan did you have? They were first sold in Oct. 22 2016 and this is only May 2017. I seem to remember 24 month financing or 12 month financing. You paid your phone off three months ago and already had sold it on Swappa for some time? datkidpatrick ya youre allowed to pay it off early... PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Maybe that's what caused the error at Fi in blacklisting by accident. datkidpatrick ya that doesn't make any sense... but it got fixed this morning by google... NeverrKnowsBest I see that now. Thanks for the clarification. In any case, there has to be something in common with these blacklisted phones, I don't think Google/Project Fi would blacklist all second hand phones, I don't think that's very plausible. Corey Kinard Do you really need to think straight when you are in competition for largest company in the world? They probably got algorithms looking for shit and those algorithms mess up. 4Ui812 That's pretty shitty Google. David Bowline Is it really? What's shitty is the people buying in bulk just to make an easy buck and therefore screwing people over. Swappa needs to go after these people. jonzey231 Yeah but if I bought a Pixel LAST YEAR and wanted to sell it no in preparation for the next Pixel or the OP5, for example, my customer may get screwed even though it was just an innocent buy and resell. Max Uh? That's not what happened here... so far this situation seems to be the result of a reseller elaborate plan to evade tax and sell the scarce phone for a bigger profit. This wasn't an individual reselling his/her own phone. jonzey231 Uh? I know that it was originally caused by the douche bags in NJ, but now it's affecting regular people. David Bowline No they won't. I'll bet you can call Google and set it up at the time. Use your noggin and quit jumping to conclusions before the fact. jonzey231 But you saying that is also jumping to conclusions, just on the other side of the argument. If you want to argue me, call Google and play it out. Report your findings here. Otherwise, your words mean no more or less than mine. 4Ui812 That's called capitalism. No one is forcing you to buy it. What Google needs to do is fix all the reported issues with that shitty phone. As for the limited supply of said phone , again that's Google's fault (hell , I wouldn't be surprised if Google intentionally limted the supply ... That's a play out of nintys handbook) Duder12 I have a pixel. There is nothing wrong with my phone. I love it. SirCanealot But I have a Pixel and it is broken. Surely this is not possible to exist in reality? :O :O :O David Bowline If Google is selling phones to a specific customer, who then turns around and sells them en masse, how is Google to know what was sold legally and what was stolen? Google has every right to blacklist those phones. Nobody forced anyone to buy a phone from some jerk on swappa. Its the responsibility of the middle man seller to take care of the problem, not Google. This isn't rocket science here. 4Ui812 You're right , it's not rocket science. If the phone is reported as stolen then it's ok to black list the IMEI. This story makes no mention of phones being stolen. Therefore like I said.... That's pretty shitty Google. A Person It may suck, but who is to decide how my money is spent? kbbl Caveat emptor. SeanPR11 Or.... don't buy your phone from a New Jersey Douchebag. If people don't buy from them, they will stop doing this bullshit. It sucks that regular people are caught in the middle (which happens all too often). It seems Swappa should have known these phones were out there (given the business they are in) and flagged them with the IMEI checker. Alex Excuse them for doing whatever they like with a product they purchased. Pfff David Bowline Then Google can assume that they were stolen and blacklist them. It's not Googles fault here. JFC. SeanPR11 Amen. Ryan from GroupTweet Yes, its shitty. If anything Google should go after the reseller, not the innocent legitimate customers that bought the devices and who are now punished because their phones are blacklisted. Alexander Z Great Swappa can't GO after anyone. Maybe suspend/revoke their account but that's it. My trusted seller hasn't been any help at all with the blacklisted pixel I bought. It's so messed up!! T4rd Saw the site/forum owner of a site I frequent get hit with this on his Pixel this week too. Crazy how the Pixel is being plagued with all sorts of extraneous issues. They can't stay in stock, forcing people to buy second hand, then they get black listed because of some weird policy Google has with Project Fi phones. Max Well being out of stock has nothing strange coming from a Google phone, that's been their main issue for a few years now (Nexus), and it happens even to Apple on launch but the difference is that they're a lot better ramping up production afterwards. This blacklisting is really weird, but so far it seems to be potentially related to a shady reseller so we'll have to wait and see if we get more clarification soon. Geoff Johnson As someone from New Hampshire, it's weird to see my state in an AP article, since nothing interesting ever happens here lol. This sucks though because buyers who bought their Pixel 2nd hand months ago now suddenly might get it blacklisted? J.J. Holy f. That is terrible. So random guy buys a second hand pixel (because Google was out of stock) later gets blacklisted by Google/fi. Gets no help from Google. Never buys a Google phone again. Real smart. Green Dog This on top of the seeming shaky quality of the phones may force me to an iPhone. J.J. I feel ya there but, i just can't do the iPhone thing. Loving this s8+ right now. Duder12 When consumers say this its just sad. Why when you have a difficult time with one android manufacturer immediately think its all Androids and switch to the iPhone? This is how Apple gets tons of customers. Everyone that had a bad time with Samsung just assumed their only other option was iPhone bc MARKETING. Green Dog Because I don't want to have to deal with OS updates through the carrier or a limited phone in terms of LTE bands, as is common for Android phones? People like other phones and I've played with some of them, but I like the Pixel/Nexus lines. But this does give me pause. blenderboy Well, the only offering that competes with iPhone in the world of android is the pixel phone. Samsung displays(hardware in general) are great but software experience can't be compared with iPhone or pixel. It is just sad that they can't keep up with Apple or Google. Google is trying really hard to reach there. I am still using Android because of the platforms openness. Duder12 Fair enough but you know what I mean. You are an exception but A LOT of consumers act this way. Honestly I bought my Pixel through the Google Store last fall and its been solid. I love it. Google needs to sort out the second hand market but these are growing pains. Hardware is still new to them bc the nexus line had help from the OEMs. Now they dont. marcusmarcus2 His comment does not address all Androids. He is only speaking of this one phone. It could be he was between using phones by Google and iPhones and he choose to go with Google's phone. Now with this situation, he decided to go to his second choice. I'm not defending switching to an iPhone over another manufacturer, just pointing out his statement you criticized did not say what you thought it was saying and you were the one to actually apply his statement to all Androids. Just playing the devil's advocate here Alex Because when you pay 7-8-900€ (the price of an iPhone) on an Android phone you expect it to be flawless. And that's normal! However, in real life, regardless if you pay 300 or 800€, Android remains Android, with its notoriously inconsistent battery life, inexplicable wakelocks, unfixed bugs (don't get me stored on the "low priority" bugs with thousands of stars), 2 year updates, etc, etc. tekfr33kn That seems a little dramatic considering that iPhones are far from flawless. You also pay that amount for your average laptop and they aren't flawless. It seems you, or someone else, is holding Android phones to an unrealistic standard. Alex Please don't compare a laptop with an Android phone. It makes absolutely no sense. Isn't it rather that manufacturers (Google being the first of them) increase the prices each year to hallucinating levels with little to no innovation or improvement in user experience. Take the S8 line. Beautiful phones, remarkable design, but a fraction of the cost you pay goes to that crap Bixby that nobody wants tekfr33kn I'll agree with you that Google is artificially raising the price far beyond what it should be but that's basic capitalism and market forces. If the market doesn't want those kinds of prices or can't support it, it won't sell. The issue is that people are actually willing to pay that. iPhones are the primary example. There's about $400 - $500 worth of stuff put in a phone that goes for $800 - $1000 and they still sell like hotcakes. I also agree with you about the S8's and Bixby but again, the market says that the S8 is a hot seller and so Samsung isn't about to change that trend. That kind of makes your argument moot. As for comparing a smartphone to a laptop - if you can't see the comparisons, it's either willful ignorance or you just don't know a thing about electronic devices (specifically smartphones or laptops). In either case, I can't help you with that. The fact is that they share more in common that differences. It's one of the many reasons that development strategies (hardware and software) often translate quite well between them. xyz Uhm, because the phone in question is the overpriced Google phone that is intended to compete with the iPhone and which Google fanboys insist is the greatest Android phone of all time. psychic99 It costs about the same to make a Pixel XL as it does an iphone 7, so why would you expect Google to make less margin than Apple? I will say their ecosystem and support SUCKs compared to Apple, so yeah it should be hundred less because the lifecycle experience of a Pixel will be much worse than Apple and the fact that they artificially end support after 2 years is atrocious. I have 4+ year old Nexus that operate just fine on custom ROMs. And BTW I don't think it is worth it either and happily keep my Nexus 6p for less than 50% the cost. I can't rationalize the price they are asking. Google's support is not consistent. Either they will go over the top to help, or tell you go away you are screwed, There is nothing in the middle, and until you engage them you have no idea if you are going to get help or the hand. Yet another reason they should be hundreds less. Merrill Sampson Just FYI, Google announced at IO a few days ago that they're extending the support cycle on the Pixel from 2 year to 5. marcusmarcus2 Do you have a source for that? https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/4457705?hl=en#nexus_devices Android Version updates: October 2018 Security updates: October 2019 Duder12 Dont forget that apple blocked iPhones that had their fingerprint sensor replaced. Also, dont forget Apple is trying to get a bill banned that will allow consumers to have 3rd parties fix phones. PS: My Pixel is fucking awesome. NexusKoolaid "Dont forget that apple blocked iPhones that had their fingerprint sensor replaced." And this in and of itself was a good thing. With the sensor and the CPU being paired, the sudden appearance of a new sensor having a new signature was deemed to be a security breach. I'm not standing up for Apple here, just calling a spade a spade. And I don't know what information Apple could have shared with 3rd party repair houses (if they were inclined to play nice with them) without compromising security. "PS: My Pixel is fucking awesome." I wish I had one. But they were so hard to get hold of for so long that at this point I'll hang on to my 6P until the Pixel2 is out. psychic99 On Android if you reinstall the O/S or make major modifications they simply invalidate the fingerprint then you have to enter the password manually as a failback. Then you can enrol your fingerprint again. In fact every few days you have to manually enter your pin on N to get into the phone. Sounds like a reasonable method, rather than locking the phone forever. Apple went one step farther. You should go watch youtube... Apple is on a mission to make 3rd party repair a thing of the past. They even specifically make it hard to repair. They want control of the supply chain and dispose of equipment as fast as possible. NexusKoolaid On your first point, there is little control over hardware used to support the platform, so core design decisions are prone to fall back to a software solution. Apple on the other hand has tight control of their hardware and have the option for hardware based solutions, whatever the motivation might be, such as better security or to maintain control of their platform (probably a mix on the two). On your second point, I've read the headlines and seen videos on Youtube (like Louis Rossman). Yeah - their crusade against 3rd party repair sickens me to no small degree. Not just because it would prevent me from seeking out more economical and timely repair of my phone (if I had an iPhone), but because this type of precedent could trickle down to other things I might want to tinker with. Jay Hate to say it but that is the risk people run when you don't buy your devices brand new. J.J. True. But they exasperate said risk artificially for the perceived end goal.... More Profit. The truth is they are doing the exact opposite. This news definitely makes me pause on buying a pixel at all. The Second hand market is real and if i have a bad experience do to Google on a second hand device i will probably not buy new from them when i have the funds. james fuston If you (or the person who sells you a phone) violates the terms of service, you're gonna have a bad time regardless of manufacturer. blenderboy Real question to ask, did Apple ever had similar issue with many devices? hunter2 Probably not since Apple realizes that the perceived strong resale value is a determining factor for many people. Even people who may have never sold a product second hand gain some comfort from the knowledge that they could potentially recoup a lot of their costs if they ever needed to sell. ericshmerick Do the TOS say you can never ever resell the device? Serious question. ekana_stone No the TOS is that you resell as soon as you bought it, so like if you bought from fi cuz it's cheaper and the resold it a little under asking. It's only those phones that were black listed ericshmerick What defines "as soon as?" 5 minutes after purchase? 1 week? 2.8 months? 3 years? marcusmarcus2 Do we have confirmation that it is only those phones that were black listed? Could they have inadvertently black listed other phones from fi? EarlyMon The TOS say that commercial resale is not allowed and lots of them were resold by a private company in a scheme that tried to avoid sales tax. Chris Pretty sure that the Supreme Court just ruled that after you purchase the item the first time that you are allowed to resell it. EarlyMon Commercial resale, not individual resale, is the issue here - a gray market supplier. Look at the number of complaints from people who expected Google support and didn't think that it mattered that they were buying what they thought were the Google version only to find out that they were Verizon models. That's one of the things that the store I referred to evidently did. Who mail orders a Pixel from a New Hampshire store to save the cost of taxes added when we all know what the only outlets are? Santos Chavez It actually does say that isn't allowed, hence why they initially banned several accounts the first time. It was a breach of their TOS, and it still is. It's likely Project Fi saw these phones as stolen and blacklisted them. james fuston "You may only purchase Devices for your personal use. You may not commercially resell any Device, but you may give the Device as a gift." So if you purchase the device and resell it in New (unopened) condition, yeah. Fi could also pretty easily make the case that if you purchased the phone and turned around to sell it before the expiry of the original installment plan that you had purchased it with the intention of reselling. MisterAlex That's still not a commercial sale. If I go to the store, buy a Nintendo Switch, and immediately list it as a brand new Switch on Craigslist, I'm not a commercial seller. I'm still an individual selling something that's fully within my "first sale" rights to sell. james fuston Yeah, that's true if you're reading the second, and only the second, sentence there. The first one pretty clearly states "You may only purchase Devices for your personal use" MisterAlex If you think that reselling a personally owned item goes beyond the bounds of personal use, you're kidding yourself (and so is anyone who thinks that line of thinking would hold water, legally speaking). First Sale is a very broad consumer protection, my friend. Once you buy something of your own, you can do whatever you want with it, including sell it. (Edit: in the States, anyway.) james fuston Yep! Totally fine for you to sell it. Also totally fine for Google to deactivate your phone when you've done something you agreed not to do at the time of purchase. It's then legally on you to prove that they overstepped. MisterAlex You're clearly not parsing what I'm posting. Selling privately owned property is within the bounds of "personal use." james fuston Seeing as Google specifically included a clause about gifting, I'd venture to say they disagree with you. MisterAlex That's fine. Sony also disagreed that it had done anything wrong by removing Other OS. james fuston Cool! So we agree that whether or not you believe Google's terms of service to be legal, it's entirely on the customer to take action after being penalized for a violation of said terms of service. MisterAlex It's always up to the wronged party to seek litigation against a wrongdoer. james fuston In that case, I have no idea why you started commenting on legality when I was discussing terms of service violations. Rather, I would have no idea why if this weren't the comment section. MisterAlex A TOS is not a legally binding agreement. You defended enforcement of a TOS when that enforcement went contrary to law. That's why I brought up the comparison to Sony's PS3 lawsuit (which it lost). james fuston I'm not discussing whether terms of service are legally binding. I'm discussing whether or not the action being described (selling the phone) violates the ToS. It does. MisterAlex And my counter was to point out that putting something in a TOS doesn't make it hunky-dory. In fact, it's quite possible for a TOS to violate law. As I've illustrated. bekifft This is where America is so great. Even if the TOS is unenforceable by law, it is technologically enforceable, obviously. So they do it anyway, and now the onus is on you the little guy to get the multinational corporation to knock it off. Vape John most likely carrier issues the blacklisting... so project fi is the culprit psychic99 More profit? The sell them $150 below market rates. That is not free. I don't know what is actually going on but I would suspect that the original owner did something wrong or unethical. To be honest Google's systems are weird. I ported out my nexus5x and it took them almost 3 months to Bill me for the remainder. So maybe the original person cancelled their card, played games with DPP, activated it for one day and did it again. And again. xyz Fortunately, you can just buy an iPhone and get top notch support. hunter2 So the answer is to buy everything new and toss the old device in the landfill? Kind of sad to see how people just roll over and let over-reaching companies basically decimate the second hand market so they can increase their profits. Jay Never said that and you know it. I said this is the risk you take.. It's as simple as that. trixnkix637 That's the risk you take for not buying from reputable sources. Buying used has risks. Sucks he found out the hard way. jb0nez But the article says it's not Google, it's the carrier who blacklisted. Whatever that means... hunter2 That makes no sense. The carrier technically blocks that IMEI on their network, but only after another carrier submits it to the blacklist. It would be like if you SWATTED somebody and then said "it was the police who came to your house with guns not me". pfmiller On top of that this seems like an abuse of the blacklisting system. The system is intended to discourage theft, not as a means for companies to get revenge on their customers. psychic99 That's not true. Companies have been blacklisting devices for years if tos wasn't met. I have bought 3 phones through fi and they are heavily discounted. Google doesn't do that for free they expect you to activate them on fi for more than one day. Also if you are buying a phone from an individual and not a dealer you are taking a risk straight up. I have had friend have their phones blacklisted when they have bought phones from people and then they turned around and reported them as stolen. Swappa is a marketplace not a arbitrator. They are facilitating a sale. You guys need to know the difference. PayPal is your friend. hunter2 That's dumb. The whole point of cancellation fees is to re-coup the cost of subsidies if you break the contract. By going a different route, the only people who are getting punished are the people buying these phones. psychic99 Lots of people don't pay them and I have seen numerous accounts where friends have bought phones and have told me they got a "deal of a lifetime" to find their devices blacklisted and guess what they were people who never paid off their termination fees or have sold them then reported them stolen. And as an individual you need to take responsibility, if you purchase anything through a private transaction you should ask for poof of sale, do they own it, have it put in writing, etc. That way if the seller does something illegal then you have a remedy. This doesn't derisk anything tho. This is good education for people, to know where responsibility lies and the risks of buying from an individual versus an established dealer. In the case of Swappa, you should buy via Paypal, so there is a remedy. You can chargeback your loss if this happens within 6 months (I have done this will unethical sellers), so they are not being punished they are being inconvenienced. But that is the RISK you take buying from an individual. hunter2 I know you want to see Google as the good guy here, but within these comments there are accounts from people who bought outright, and months later sold their Pixel's and now months after that sale are being contacted by the seller about the device being blacklisted. bekifft I think you're missing his point. It's not about Google being the good or bad guy, it's that buying something third party is inherently risky and he's right, you should ask for a chain of evidence that proves the device is legit. Maybe I'm also just tired of people claiming they can find things so cheap online, when most of it is scams like this, and just devalues the whole market. hunter2 You need to look through these comments. There are people here who bought their phones directly from Fi and after switching carriers their fully paid off phones have been blacklisted. They were the original owners and these phones were never sold. There are also people here who bought phones, used them for months, and sold them after they were fully paid off. These people are saying that the proper they sold the phones to are now coming back and telling them they're blacklisted. bekifft In that case that is indeed disturbing. I am a Fi subscriber though I bought my phone direct from the Google store. Sounds like someone made a big mistake on the back end. Lance Biddle I bought my phone from Project Fi, and it has become blacklisted after changing to another carrier. Google is definitely the bad guy right now IMO pfmiller Just because other companies have been doing it, doesn't mean that it's not an abuse of the system. It's clearly not what the blacklisting system was intended for. Lance Biddle How about when you buy the phone from Project Fi, decide to switch carriers and the phone you outright own becomes black listed. I cannot connect to the Verizon service I'm paying for. And Verizon cannot do anything about. And Google/Project Fi isn't. I've wasted way too much time on the phone trying to get this resolved. They have told me it could be 2-5+ days to get it fixed. WTF!! Never Google again. Never. J.J. I'm sorry. That sucks hard. ProductFRED Considering the original seller probably isn't going to pay people back, all Google did was fuck over a bunch of legitimate customers. iPhone reselling is also a big issue, especially on new releases, but you don't see Apple doing this. J.J. Agree 💯. Most of these customers involved (who probably have had hardware and software issues already on top​ of this) will never buy a pixel again! Cassidy James Blaede Just for the record, the majority of Pixel users likely never have hardware or software issues. I, my mom, and a couple of my friends have Pixels and haven't had any issues. You probably hear about issues on Reddit a lot because the only reason to visit the Pixel subreddit is to complain. 🙃 Jordan L no issues here too. J.J. Not a redditer lol, but many other sites show the issues(as low as they may be) and if you were on the fence about spending that kind of money, these stories alone may sway many Duder12 Yep. Just like iphone touch disease and early shutdowns. Tr3ple Never had those issues. xyz That's true. I personally don't know anyone who has been murdered. Therefore, no one gets murdered. Cassidy James Blaede I'd wager that the majority of people don't get murdered. 😉 Written Description My Pixel XL has performed flawlessly since its purchase and it's my first Android phone after using every iPhone from the first generation on. Google's AI is better, its cloud storage is infinitely better, and I don't see going back to Apple anytime soon. J.J. I'm glad you have not had issues.... Others however have Duder12 Not me. Corey Kinard 3rd Np. Duder12 Mines been great... atl3630 great here too. Cael Apple is not a "carrier". ProductFRED Neither is Google. They just use other carriers' networks. Either way, that isn't justification for what they're doing. Unless they plan on replacing everyone's Pixel (which looks like a hard no), they fucked over a lot of legitimate customers. I buy my devices off of swappa most of the time. Tell me how I would get this fixed if neither the seller nor Google want to take responsibility. marcusmarcus2 Google is an MVNO. Per https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-mvno-cell-phone-carrier-578673 "An MVNO is a cell phone carrier (such as a prepaid wireless carrier) that typically does not have its own network infrastructure and licensed radio spectrum" Apple is not even an MVNO carrier. drksilenc fi is a carrier... JD With Fi Google is a Carrier. Mitch Gray This just happened to my fiance's phone. I bought it on swappa for her birthday months ago because Google store didn't have any in stock and this morning it is blacklisted. I'm so furious. I have had every Google phone since the Galaxy Nexus and because of this policy I will never buy another phone of theirs. She is now stranded without a phone and has no way of using it for work at the busiest time of the year for her (she is a teacher and it's graduation week). Who do I contact about this? We shouldn't be punished because someone gamed the system. J.J. I feel so bad for you. I hope you get it resolved. This is an atrocity! J.J. Should definitely hassle fi/Google and let them know if they don't resolve you will never buy and tell everyone you know not to buy and so on jibust No, stop don't tell them that, they might not withstand the shock of loosing them. /S T4rd I would contact the seller of the phone and/or Swappa if they're the service you went through. If they're no help somehow, then contact Paypal if that's how you paid for it. Google isn't going to unblacklist the phone regardless of what you say to them. It's virtually impossible for a phone to be unblacklisted once it has happened, so you're going to have to just get a refund and buy another phone. A Person Good luck with that. I am hesitant to ever buy again from Swappa.. and I used to love, love, love them. I purchased a device that was blatantly not as described. I then contacted Swappa and they instructed me that it is now between me and the seller. So I contacted the seller via the sale page and was basically told: "ummmm, nah". datkidpatrick at that point you could have went thru paypal and filed a claim... T4rd That's why you buy from reputable sellers. The few minor issues I've had on there were resolved quickly. atl3630 yes, same here. To date I've never had a swappa problem that didn't get resolved and the people have been very helpful. Don't blame swappa for shitty sellers. Buy from reputable sellers (like me). yankeesusa Swappa only helps communicating. To resolve any issues you must file a PayPal claim. datkidpatrick contact the seller and see if they can contact project fi/google... King_Android Ijs, BBB is an extremely powerful tool in order to get your voice heard from Corporate asap...... Stephen Hicks If the phone is under warranty still, file an RMA claim and state the bluetooth isn't working correctly on the device and that you've already tried factory resetting the phone as well as reconnected all the bluetooth devices with no improvement. Might work? njn There is no warranty for second hand phones. JRock I purchased a bootlooping 6P off eBay for cheap, erasing/flashing firmware had same result, RMA'd to Huawei and they promptly sent me a brand new one. Mark Depending on the credit card you used to buy the phone, you might have an extended warranty that might cover this. atl3630 You can get your money back. Contact the seller through swappa and tell them the issue. They will likely tell you it's been to long, I don't care, etc. If so, then file a PayPal claim. You have six months PayPal protection. Document that the phone no longer works and send it back to the seller with tracking. Then PayPal will refund you money, no matter what the seller says. M3D1T8R But doing this will just end up screwing over the seller. PayPal will simply take the money from their account and refund it to the buyer. So that's not fair to the seller either. PayPal's "seller protection" is a fraud. And their customer service is a total joke. They should be boycotted. atl3630 How does that screw over the seller? The seller screwed himself when he sold the phone. His beef is with ProjectFi, not the buyer. Frankly the buyer shouldn't have to deal with this crap since buyers have no way to determine the history of a phone. The seller sold a phone that stopped working. That's on them. M3D1T8R Because, obviously, the seller doesn't necessarily know the history and every previous owner of every phone. What if it's a phone someone bought previously used. They used it for a while just fine, and resold it. Then this IMEI block thing happened. atl3630 Yeah, that would suck. But still, it's not the buyer's fault. If something happens and somebody gets cheated out of $500+ then you better bet people are going to exercise whatever option they can to recover their money. PayPal protection would do that for them in the first 6 months. ericshmerick So anyone who sells a phone is on the hook for its functionality until the end of time? GTFO of here with that. It's ridiculous and you know it. atl3630 Six months, moron. PayPal protection is 6 months. Like it or not, facts. Stop being a little bitch. Roh_Mish What if the seller had bought directly from google. AP mentioned about the trains but there doesn't appear to to be a link between this and that fraud. Also there are many cases where buyer on PayPal will request a reverse and never return the product, screwing over the seller. And PayPal won't do anything about this. vn33 That really sucks .. .especially to someone near and dear to you. I would be beyond furious! Hope everything works out!! Duder12 Swappa will cover you here. You are fine. Get the ball rolling. Anwar Imraan Lucas To me it seems that the original buyer had reported his credit card lost or stolen and is disputing charges on his card which in terms maybe blacklisting those devices as stolen.. blindexecutioner You do Google the service of endless beta testing their software on a way overpriced phone and they blacklist you. Nice. Lawrence Good, that is what you get for buying the Bezel XL ericshmerick OH YOUUUU!!1 theadamsegal Yet another reason I will not buy a Google device again. Tiberian For the record: Kyle Bennett is the owner and founder of HardOCP, not just a simple writer for the site. ;) Richard Gao Did not know that. Thanks! datkidpatrick this happened by to me as well... i sold my pixel 3 months ago and the buyer just informed me it was blacklisted... i had no clue project fi was doing this and legit thought the buyer was trying to scam me... i contacted project fi support and was advised it was escalated to be removed from the blacklist... i paid off the phone before i sold it... this is definitely a mistake by google/project fi... they should be correcting this soon... Jordan L Can a carrier just randomly blacklist IMEIs?! I guess so. I was reading this thread thinking 'well, people probably just bought a stolen Pixel unknowingly' but your case proves this wrong. Navneet Suresh Shitty move Google ! :/ Jay If this happened to me, I'd just return the phone to the seller, get refunded, and make them have to deal with this. Swappa made a huge fucking deal about refunding buyers after the Note7 debacle and it should be the same thing here. freshprince_87 I hope that Kyle guy reads your comment. This may help him Jay Honestly, Swappa needs to be pushing this harder. I sold my Note7 last year and despite the fact that the buyer could have gone and gotten the refund from T-Mobile themselves, they chose to take Swappa up on their suggestion of getting the refund from me. (Add to this that Swappa said if I didn't agree to the refund, they'd "suggest" the buyer take the issue up with PayPal as the device was not sold as advertised. Seriously..) datkidpatrick it isn't the sellers fault... and its something that can be fixed... Jay I fail to see how this isn't the seller's fault for trying to game the system and make a profit. This sure as hell isn't Google's fault.. so who do you want to blame then? The unsuspecting buyers? datkidpatrick it is googles fault... the point they referred to in november is completely separate from the issue happening now... the issue happening now is many pixel phones that were sold and originated from fi is getting blacklisted... i sold my pixel after paying it of legit and it just got blacklisted... now please tell me how i tried to game the system... Jay For all I know, you could be one of those shady scalpers too who tried to make a profit by gaming the system. The burden of fixing this issue should still lie on the sellers. If someone wants their money back, they have every right to make you do the legwork of figuring out how you'll make your money back. datkidpatrick I contacted project fi for the buyer and it is escalated... again the point is it wasn't my fault... marcusmarcus2 If you are just trying to sell 1 phone that you got and paid for without trying to "game the system" it is not your fault, but it is your responsibility as the seller to try and resolve the issue, which it sounds like you are doing. Who's fault is it? Hard to tell until Google releases a comment about why this is happening. Did they block these by mistake? Then it is Googles fault. Are they doing it to block the bulk buyers that were "gaming the system" and just went over board and blocked some extra phones that were not part of those that gamed the system? Then it would be the fault of Google and those that gamed the system that caused Google to make the choice. hunter2 I wouldn't say it's his responsibility. He's selling a device. If the maker of that device decides to flip a kill switch in 18 months and disable every device out there then why blame him. Google is flipping a kill switch an all kinds of devices (just below there is a comment from a guy who bought and paid for his phone, then later switched carriers and had his originally bought phone killed). Trying to blame middle men here is crazy. marcusmarcus2 I'm not blaming the seller. Please re-read. I said the fault is with Google if they are the ones that decided to black list them. It is the sellers responsibility to try figure out why a device they sold is blacklisted. If they did nothing wrong, then they should be able to get it unblacklisted by working with Google. From the looks of some of the comments on here, it looks like the buyer would not be able to get the device of the black list but the seller should be able to. Again, I'm not blaming the middle man. There is a difference between fault and responsibility. Fault sounds like it is fully on Google. Responsibility goes across everyone though with some having more responsibility. Buyer has some responsibility to report the issue to the seller instead of just reporting it to paypal. Seller has more responsibility than the seller because they would be the one who would be able to work with Google/fi to get it off the black list. Google/fi would have even more responsibility to explain why devices are being blacklisted and getting devices off the black list if they should not be on there. Max As a somewhat frequent seller/buyer on Swappa and Ebay I can say that this is definitely the sellers responsibility to fix the problem or promptly accept a return for a refund otherwise this isn't so different from a bait and switch situation. datkidpatrick how is it a bait and switch if i paid off a phone legit and decided to sell it after... 3 months later it gets blacklisted... this is a mistake by google and its their responsibility to fix... Max If you paid off the phone legit and didn't do anything shady then it wouldn't have been blacklisted and if it was you, as the original buyer, are the one with more authority to contact Google, not the second hand buyer, therefore it's your responsibility to fix it. The buyer with a blacklisted phone has zero reasons to believe that you were truthful in your description even if you were. datkidpatrick well i did contact project fi for the buyer and it is escalated... Max Then you're doing the right thing (taking responsibility) and hopefully this gets resolved quickly by Fi! Although I don't know if they can just un-blacklist a phone? Hopefully they can. ericshmerick If I buy a product from a retail store and 92 days later it has an issue, guess what they will tell me when I show up barking for a refund? Yeah, pound sand kid. That's what they will say. So why do Swappa sellers suddenly have the responsibility to refund forever ala Costco? I get people are pissy at the situation, but the seller isn't responsible for Google's shadyness here. Max We're not talking about "an issue" here because that's what warranties are for, we're talking about a phone reported as lost/stolen after being sold this could potentially mean a fraudster that didn't fully pay the phone or a thief that sold a stolen phone, I doubt any serious retailer would do that... By the way that's what buyer protections are for, Paypal has six months of protection and credit card providers can be very flexible if you explain your case well and you're in the right. If a retailer pull something like this they would never win a chargeback. Max We're not talking about "an issue" here because that's what warranties are for, we're talking about a phone reported as lost/stolen after being sold this could potentially mean a fraudster that didn't fully pay the phone or a thief that sold a stolen phone, I doubt any serious retailer would do that...

If a retailer pull something like this they would never win a charge back and the manufacturer and distributor would never be involved in the original transaction or charge back, it would be up to the retailer to go after the manufacturer or distributor. ericshmerick But nothing shady or illegal is going on here. If I and the original buyer and I use it on project fi for two months, then decide to sell it. How does that suddenly implicate me as being some sort of shady criminal? I would simply be selling a legally purchased piece of hardware that was paid in full. Max Can you please elaborate how the buyer knows that you sold "a legally purchased piece of hardware that was paid in full" if he has a blacklisted phone reported as lost/stolen in the hands? Good luck convincing the buyer, Paypal and a Bank that you're in the right in such a situation... Luxferro If they sold you shady (stolen or not legal) products you'd be dealing with them. tnt These are not devices being bought from an official retailer. There's no need to question the history of a device bought from Costco. Swappa (and Ebay and Craigslist for that matter) are not the same type of market. It's the seller's responsibility to know the history (as much as possible anyway) of the devices they're selling. freshprince_87 I guess it's safer to buy a Verizon Google Pixel instead if you intend on reselling it later. So the future buyer isn't screwed by Google. That is such a ridiculous policy drksilenc have to have a line with verizon to do that though. Wendell Brown Apparently not, this dude says his WERE Verizon phones that were locked.... https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/6d2yse/2_of_my_3_google_pixel_phones_blacklisted_on_the/ Me Google is just shooting themselves in the foot at this point with the Pixel Yan Qin I just sold my Pixel XL and switch to Galaxy S8, I do think I was out of my mind that I actually bought Pixel at full price. Jordan L anyone resell a project fi phone NOT through Swappa and have it blacklisted? maybe ProjectFi blacklisted only Swappa phones(still a strange move if it was on purpose) Jagermeister 2 of my 3 Pixel phones showed up blacklisted 2 days ago. I made a reddit post yesterday of my issue. I though it was part of an insurance fraud scam. https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/6d2yse/2_of_my_3_google_pixel_phones_blacklisted_on_the/ I had originally though our phones were from Verizon not Google Fi. We were happy Pixel customers that are now considering purchasing different phones because Google can report as stolen whenever they feel a Google Fi device was not transferred to a new owner per their TOS. How can any user purchasing a pre-owned or "new" Google Pixel be sure that it isn't a Google Fi device and won't be blacklisted in the future? Max Johnson Note to self, don't buy second hand Google devices. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Note to everyone: Don't buy first hand Google devices. Max Why? Mine works perfectly fine and so far it's the best phone I've ever owned. Dana Yeah, it's fine as long as you don't get it from Project Fi because you can't sell it if you want to upgrade to a new device. Max LOL, what? I simply bought it directly from store.google.com, no issues here and I can provide proof. This is something related to phones sold through Fi. hunter2 Congrats, scroll up one comment and you'll find a guy who's phone is blacklisted despite him being the original owner and being fully paid off. To answer your question of "Why", it's because not everyone is as comfortable gambling with their money as you are. Max 1) It was blacklisted by the carrier, not the manufacturer. 2) It was blacklisted after it was resold, sucks but as far as we know it doesn't affect the original seller, there's a difference there. 3) We don't know yet why this really happened. 4) Even with all of the above, I don't see how it fits in a "Don't buy first hand Google devices." statement. Maybe if you tell me "Don't deal with Project Fi service" I could somewhat agree. hunter2 http://disq.us/p/1iz7ts3 Sorry, should have permalinked the comment since the order is moving per votes. That guy was the original owner and claims to have been paid off. Moved to Verizon at some point and had the device he originally bough directly from Google blacklisted. Max Well that negates my point 2 and sucks even more. But still the blame here points 100% to Project Fi and not the phone itself nor Google as the manufacturer of the phone. Something really strange is happening with Project Fi devices and hopefully they will find out soon if it's an error, incompetence, sabotage or maybe even hacking. hunter2 I guess it depends on how willing you are to absolve the parent company of things a specific branch is doing. It would be like saying "don't blame MS, it's the IE team who makes the browser" during the IE6 days. Max Legally is evident that the responsibility is on Google but if you think that the group in charge of designing and manufacturing the Pixel has any minimal clue about what happens inside the group of the MVNO Project Fi then you're frankly clueless about how such a huge company works. By the way IE and Edge sucks but Visual Studio rocks and I'm liking more Windows 10 recently but I guess I should avoid using everything Microsoft because IE really sucks, right? hunter2 If a decisions like these can be made without going far enough up the chain of command that you're dealing with some higher ups, then I don't really want to know how this company runs. It's enough to tell me that I can't really trust them because you can't really depend on a company keeping in line with their corporate ideals when individual units can work with this much impunity. Avoiding/disliking MS was never about IE sucking. It was about IE being openly hostile and damaging to the web. This complaint was obviously projected at Microsoft themselves since no one believed that the IE team was working in a bubble. I don't know how old you are so maybe you weren't around when all this was going on. It's not about disliking a company because one or some of their many products are inferior. It's about disliking them because they employ user hostile tactics and you don't feel like you can support that (or at the very least want to punish them in the tiny way you can by voting with your wallet). Max So you already got an official response from Google about this? Can you share it? Because so far I have only read guesses about what is happening and nothing official yet. I'm old enough to have used MS-DOS 5 & 6 as well as Windows 3.1. That doesn't change the fact that saying "don't buy anything from a company" based on one division issues is just silly. If Google officially says that all of this was planned then maybe you could have a point, until then you're just stretching facts to prove a weak point. hunter2 I don't need to fill in the facts. I'm saying either way it's bad. The facts are that this happened. Additional facts about why it happened are irrelevant Max Well, if you're happy thinking like that be my guest, I guess some people is unable to see the colors and think the world is black and white. hunter2 For people whom this isn't a mundane thought experiment but are actually in a position where they need to buy a new device (not everyone is able to be without their phone until Google ultimately resolves this); the shades of gray in this scenario don't change their circumstances. The facts are that they have a phone that was remotely disabled. I'm assuming your shades of gray are the how's and why's of that? How is that of any consequence to these people? Steve_Jobroni Shut up, troll. DanSan got em! Matt This will be great for their resale value. ericshmerick Swappa comments: I GEEVE U $200 BUY NOW FINAL OFFERS!! JD Wooooo! Go Pixel, I'm definately not going near any Google hardware with a 1000ft pole now.I may use my 1001ft pole. In Many states, and at least in Canada this is not legal, you can't blacklist a phone for ToS violation. There's a very narrow list of reasons for a device to be blacklisted. Cuong This is a really shitty move from Google. At least sent a notification few days in advance and offer a way to appeal. What if a person was in an emergency situation? Imagine the lawsuit for that, Google. Why customers have to suffer because Google can't control their resellers? ericshmerick 911 always works. segag Thats Fuck all! Snowsky Mountain This may seriously make me rethink my use of Google hardware (especially phones). Stevie Do no evil Google. Do no evil. My Dixie Wrecked Yeah, they got rid of that mandate years ago. Seriously. Look it up. mxwp lol, yeah it was pretty funny. but i give Big G props for being somewhat honest about that. "hmm, we're huge now and so just cannot help to do some evil" Corey Kinard Just looked​ it up. Looks like it's still in place for Google. Alphabet's is different l though. It's "do the right thing." Sruly J Bought an unlocked Pixel yesterday for $334. Before I send it in to get checked and fixed by Google, I really should check the IMEI (normally I'd have the IMEI first, but the seller didn't give it to me). Michael D’Ambrosio "Someone with an answer." That'll get you far with Tech support. Smh vn33 Does the blacklisted phone works out of US, say in Canada? I assume yes, if it's the carriers that are doing the blacklisting. that said, it would really dampen my desire for a phone from Google. Stevie I am crossing my fingers that they don't come after my Nexus 6. Already bought and activated. There's no going back right? speedy1979 So to clarify google is randomly blacklisting any google pixel that is resold. I actually considered buying a ProjectFi device sometime ago; so glad I didn't go through with it. Kris Crowley I have fi service. When you buy a phone through fi you got a discount or a phone that you can't get through the Google store if you want. There is a disclaimer that if you buy it and never activate it that you will be charged additional Monies within 30 days. Now without knowing isn't possible that A the phone was bought at a discount and B the additional fee was levied but never paid? trixnkix637 Know the risks of buying used people. Do your homework. Asking where the seller bought the phone originally could've prevented all of this. Can't blame Google because someone tried to game the system both ways. marcusmarcus2 Know the risks of not using commas, people. You should never buy people, whether they are used or new. Rony Hmmm, is there a difference between a new and a used person. I've scoured the forums and haven't got a clear answer. marcusmarcus2 You would have to ask them before you buy them. They usually know when they've been used. But again, you should not buy any people. Def Ref But if you try to rent people, you start hearing words like "solicitation" and that's no fun. marcusmarcus2 Don't rent them either. While we are at it. Do not borrow, loan or steal people. Def Ref Is enticement allowed in your no fun world? Asking for a friend. marcusmarcus2 I don't see a problem with enticement as long as that enticement does not lead to stealing people. "No fun world"? You mean my world where I think people should not be viewed or treated as items/property? If yes, then yeah, I guess it is a no fun world. Def Ref Lighten up, Francis. marcusmarcus2 Lighten up, Francis? https://38.media.tumblr.com/39ef7347a58e308e67a5bd01cd124431/tumblr_nsld6lafvE1qh124lo1_500.gif Def Ref https://youtu.be/0OnpkDWbeJs That the title is misspelled AND mispunctuated is bonus. trixnkix637 Didn't NY and NV allow for the renting of people or is that wishful thinking? Asking for a friend. Rod This was so good, I had to sign into Disqus to upvote. trixnkix637 Buying people has been around for ages. Can't just stop now because of commas. marcusmarcus2 Buying used has been around for ages. trixnkix637 And so has it's risks. ericshmerick Wow I feel bad for the Swappa sellers who are getting PayPal charge backs right about now. Alexander Z Great This was the response I received. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/948da6656e25823e8dc529c4571fbc2d347f5e820ee9b7c91844d48c9745a112.png DanSan owner of the device ≠ person who purchased. way to go google. InnocentEd News flash this could happen with any phone from any manufacturer on any network that is resold used. I've had it happen with 2 iPhones and Apple could have cared less. You buy used, you take the risk. It's amazing how even credited tech journalists assume devices on Swappa are always going to be 100% safe. If Project Fi were not allowed to be resold via T&S then it's no diff than blacklisting a resold stolen phone...they had every right. Bewear This is why we can't have nice things. Rony Honestly this makes total sense. Its technically stealing the phone if you buy it for a discounted price and you dont activate it and sell it again. I think they made the right move. raffr It's not "technically" stealing. If you purchase a product at the price requested, you did not steal it. IF, big IF, in your purchase agreement it states you cannot resell the phone without activating it first, then google has a case. Serge Cebrian if you are paying for the service ... you are still paying for it even if you keep your older phone or a better phone if you want to unless you stop paying then its stealing ... but not if you keep the service// marcusmarcus2 They could have blacklisted these phones for that reason. But they could have also been overzealous when blacklisting devices and blacklisted numerous other devices that people did not do that with. It may have been the right move to block those that did do that, but if they inadvertently blocked additional devices, then hopefully they make the right move and unblock those devices that should not have been blocked. newtonfb Not new. Wife got a 5x on swappa. Phone was originally on FI but never taken off the account. We tried to activate it on FI but they did we couldn't until the owner released the phone? It worked fine on any other carrier. Had to get a new 5x Lance Biddle I paid off my pixel through project fi. I recently switched to Verizon. Yesterday Verizon notified me that my phone had been reported as stolen! When I awoke this morning my service had been disabled by Verizon. The support from Project Fi has been abysmal. What do I do to fix this? Corey Kinard Go to Reddit. Get ready for talks with the Better Business Bureau. Keep contacting Fi, keep screenshotting all the correspondences, you get all the buyers info in order to prove you are the original device owner. You don't fix this, you didn't cause it to break. Google fixes this. Everyone affected just has to light a fire under their ass. tnt Keep pushing / escalating with Project Fi. Ryan from GroupTweet I bought a Pixel from Tradeport USA (NH based company, shit!) about 3 months ago. The phone is on T-mobile right now and still currently working (fingers crossed). From my interpretation this appears only to be affecting Pixels bought through Google Fi - and perhaps not ones bought via Google Play store unlocked? Is that correct? Is there anyway I can check to see if my pixel was in fact sold via Google FI vs Google Play? Really hoping I don't wake up to a bricked phone in the next couple mornings... Sruly J You could contact Google, provide them with the IMEI, and they could let you know if it was bought through Google Play. Ryan from GroupTweet Thanks - but don't want to risk tipping them off that my phone should be on the blacklist :( Sruly J But wouldn't they know anyways if it should be blacklisted? I mean, how else would they have blacklisted so many phones this week? lauriedesautels So I have the Pixel and was planning on selling it via Swappa after my credits end from another phone. They ended up giving me a brand new Pixel XL but their service has become horrible where I live. So please correct me if I am wrong but if the Pixel is paid off and I switch carriers/ my Pixel is a paperweight? (I don't plan on using the phone on another carrier after 3 mo). ericshmerick According to this place, you can never sell it. You must carry it with you to your grave. Robert Montoya I have a Pixel that is currently blacklisted as of 5/23/2017 I bought it from Swappa... Google says they will lift the ban in 24 to 48 hours... That was 24 hours ago.. Phone still Blacklisted Wendell Brown I must have missed where it was shown that these deactivated phones were on Project Fi. As best I can tell, the only link to Fi is from an OLD article about the guy reselling phones several months ago. Is there any proof that this is in any way Fi related? MadJoe I have to say, if Google ever blacklisted my phone in a misguided sour-grapes attempt to punish the person who sold it to me, and without compensating me for it I would be rather angry. It would also be the absolute last Google product I ever purchased. As it is, this story has me glad I don't own anything more than a $25 Chromecast that I never use. I was seriously considering the Pixel 2 as my next phone, but not any more. If they were going to be such babies about the phones being resold, they should have vetted their buyers a little better. Corey Kinard It doesn't look like they were making any money off of you in the first place... Second-hand buyers/ bargain hunters rarely go out and pre-order $800 phones. Maybe you're different. They're definitely fucking up, but considering how little the pixel one sold and how much money they make I'm not sure they'll care about this any which way the wind blows. Same way Apple can just outright tell their customers to go fuck themselves over certain problems. MadJoe The problem is that too many people will ignore a company's unscrupulous behavior. If more of us would punished them by taking away access to our wallets, they'd think twice about trying to screw us. But people are lazy and lack commitment. So you're absolutely right, Google won't feel any hit by my deciding not to buy any more of their shit because a shit-ton of blind lemmings will gladly line up to jump off that spot on the cliff I chose not to use. And when a couple of them get screwed, they will cry "why isn't anyone else interested in helping me?" as the rest of the heard ignore them. On the bright side, the cycle will continue ad nauseum until I'm in a hole in the ground. Bruce Considering the ridiculous amount they are charging for the phones (Apple pricing without the Apple level support), this just about kills the resale value for a Pixel. Who the hell is going to buy a used phone for $500+ (because the original cost is so high) if their phones get blacklisted months later. And who the hell is going to buy the phones at the original price, when resale value will drop like a rock. And this doesn't even take into account all the BS that comes with the phone to begin with. 2 years of guaranteed OS updates. Hardware issues (Bluetooth, speakers, water resistance...) which don't get acknowledged amid finger pointing. Insufficient inventory even if they were open to replacements. The 128GB version (the 32GB is too little and the 64 GB doesn't exist) costs almost a $1000. The first time they tried this with the Nexus One, it didn't go well. This doesn't seem to be going much better. The Galaxy Nexus couldn't be upgraded because of drivers. The only real hits have been the Nexus 5 and the 6P. UniBroW *clutches iPhone 7 plus despite it's inferiority to android* Tj Hariharan Wait, do we actually KNOW that the phones that are blacklisted were originally purchased for reselling for profit? All i got from this article was that the phone was originally purchased from Project Fi.. RTNDO128 My phone was effected by this. I've been having issues with no T-Mobile service for the past couple of days on Project Fi. After reading this article, I used the Swappa IMEI checker and what do you know, my phone is reported "lost/stolen". I bought my Pixel on eBay at the beginning of January. Now I'm beyond their 30 day gaurentee. What an absolute clusterfuck. RTNDO128 My phone was effected by this. I've been having issues with no T-Mobile service for the past couple of days on Project Fi. After reading this article, I used the Swappa IMEI checker and what do you know, my phone is reported "lost/stolen". I bought my Pixel on eBay in the middle of February. Now I'm beyond their 30 day guarantee. What an absolute clusterfuck. Y2J You have 180 days in Paypal. RTNDO128 Thanks, I filed a claim with them. Hopefully this situation is covered. Max Did you contact first the seller? Otherwise it's a dick move to file a claim without first giving the seller the opportunity to see if he collaborates... RTNDO128 Thanks for your opinion. As stated, I'm beyond the 30 day eBay guarantee window. I created a "dispute" through the PayPal Resolution Center, which sends a message directly to the seller. PayPal is totally uninvolved with the dispute until I choose to escalate, which will only happen if I cannot get this resolved with the seller first. I just want to have our conversations documented in the event that the seller does not want to deal with this situation. Ken Kinda weird Google said that IMEI can't be blocked by manufacturer, I'm sure that's true. But what when manufacturer is also technically the carrier? Da_James Are you saying that "buying" a device in the USA doesn't mean you own it? Just SUE. Steve_Jobroni > as it's the carrier and not the manufacturer that has the ability to blacklist devices Do people not read the full article anymore? There seems to be a lot of Jabroni's blaming Google when it's the carrier that can only do the blacklisting. Sir_Brizz But that carrier is Project Fi, aka Google... Aleksandr Ivanov Change IMEI, problem solved! AbdulB1 lol Cassidy James Blaede I'd be interested in hearing how widespread this actually is, and a response from Google. My mom bought a Pixel from Swappa because Google was out of stock, and she's been loving it. I'd hate for her phone to become a brick because of this. Leonardo Baez I see a class action demand on the horizon? Đức Thành I'm a die-hard Google fan, but wow does Google need some fixing. justmy2pennies2012 There is one simple way Google can prevent the second hand market from making a profit. 1. Provide enough stock for all those who want to purchase the device! :) Bonus: Price the device accrodingly!! I gave up trying to buy one new from VZW and the Play Store. MisterAlex Did getting a Pixel phone through Fi require signing away your rights regarding "first sale?" And is that enforceable? RayNeverLearns You are Android Police. You might want to stay more up to date on this story and keep your readers updated, especially one that has a big impact on one of the purest Android flagships. http://www.techspot.com/news/69452-pixel-phones-project-fi-showing-up-blacklisted.html datkidpatrick happy to announce the phone i sold has been taken off the blacklist after communicating with project fi... so if you're affected by this contact google or more specifically project fi support... RayNeverLearns I believe Project Fi has done this for all affected Pixels. I didn't contact the person who sold it to me (Craigslist 7 months ago... wouldn't know where to even start) yet my phone was whitelisted earlier today. A little pain and it took almost 3 days, but a good resolution. datkidpatrick thats great... happy it's fixed... Amir What an idiotic move by Google. That's suicide. HardWired I wonder how long before Tesla implement a similar system in their cars :) Sorry you signed an agreement, the car has been disabled because you decided to sell it to a used car salesman for resale. Same sort of punishment that should not be legal.

The thing does cost $4,999, but some companies may find it pretty useful. Regardless, those who do happen to have one can now enjoy the official app, which Google has just released via the Play Store. What the app can do will depend on the type of device you are using. It can accomplish certain tasks when using a tablet, while using the application with a smartphone will turn your device into a glorified controller of sorts. Tablet users can create jams, as well as collaborate on them. It’s also possible to share, work together and insert content into jams. On the other hand, smartphone users can’t create new jams, but they can control what happens in the physical Jamboard. You can use the app to detect Jamboards around you, throw content at them and include sticky notes. Go ahead and download the Jamboard app now, but it will be pretty useless unless you have that $4,999 screen. Have any of our readers tried this thing?

It has raised speculation the handset will has a port on top to enable accessories to be plugged in - including the camera, which could be used to create augmented reality apps. Scroll down for video Essential tweeted this image showing what appears to be a 360 degree camera on top An edited version of the image reveals what looks like a 360 degree camera Earlier this year it was reported Rubin had recruited over 40 people to his new firm, to be called Essential, according to Bloomberg. It aims to build an entire technology ecosystem using AI - from phones and smart home gadgets to app stores. A previous tweet shows an extremely small bezel, with Rubin saying he was 'excited to get it into more people's hands'. Rubin also teased last month that Essential is working on a device that would have 360-degree video recording capabilities RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next NASA to reveal new details on groundbreaking mission to...

Share this article Share 32 shares A previous tweet shows an extremely small bezel, with Rubin saying he was 'excited to get it into more people's hands'. 'Armed with about a 40-person team, filled with recruits from Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google, Rubin is preparing to announce a new company called Essential and serve as its Chief Executive Officer, according to people familiar with the matter,' Bloomberg said. A search in LinkedIn reveals several of the employees, including Niccolo De Masi, the ex-CEO of Glu Mobuile, who is listed as the firm's President & COO.  Rubin also recently hired Andy Fouché from Magic Leap, a Google backed firm developing AR glasses.  Bloomberg claims Essential will produce an range of both home and mobile products, and Rubin discussed his handset plans with Sprint executives at the recent CES show. Rubin also teased last month that Essential is working on a device that would have 360-degree video recording capabilities ANDY RUBIN'S CAREER  Born in 1963, New Yorker Any Rubin worked on the first generation of wireless digital assistants, known as PDA. In December 1999 he launched Danger, creator of the Hiptop, a proto-smartphone, which was later bought by Microsoft.  Rubin cofounded Android in 2003 and sold it to Google in 2005, moving to the firm. In December 2013, Rubin started management of the robotics division of Google, before leaving on 30 October 2014 to start an incubator for hardware startups. Rubin and his wife, Rie, also own and operate Voyageur du Temps, a bakery in Los Altos, CA.   Rubin registered Essential Products Inc. with California regulators in November 2015, and in late 2016, the company registered 'Essential' with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. There, it listed smartphones, tablets, accessories and 'computer operating software for mobile phones' among its goods and services.  According to Bloomberg, the handset will be aimed at the luxury end of the market, and could be expanded using plug in modules.  Rubin is aiming to put the phone on sale around the middle of this year for a price close to that of an iPhone 7 ($649), a person familiar with the matter told Bloomberg, although they admitted 'all of the plans are still in flux'. Rubin is convinced AI is the next big change to ripple through the technology industry.  'New computing platforms happen every 10 to 12 years,' he said at the Bloomberg Technology Conference in June.  He believes that AI in the future will go one step further - being so powerful that it underpins every connected device. Mr Rubin said a combination of quantum computing and AI advancements could yield a conscious intelligence that would control every internet-enabled gadget.  Andy Rubin has recruited over 40 people to his new firm, to be called Essential, according to Bloomberg. It aims to build an entire technology ecosystem from phones to app stores and smart home gadgets.  'If you have computing that is as powerful as this could be, you might only need one. 'It might not be something you carry around; it just has to be conscious.' While Mr Rubin's claims are currently theoretical, his investment fund, Playground Global, is investing $300 million in companies trying to make this future of AI a reality. One of the companies his fund is investing in, is a quantum computing firm. Its name has not been disclosed. The company is made up of researchers who may one day be able to commercialise quantum devises using standard manufacturing processes, which could massively boost processing power.  Bloomberg claims Essential will produce an range of both home and mobile products, and Rubin (pictured) discussed his handset plans with Sprint executives at the recent CES show. Mr Rubin said: 'In order for AI to blossom and fulfill consumer needs, it has to be about data. 'That's where robotics come in - robots are walking mobile sensors, who can sense their environment and interact and learn from those interactions.'  Foxconn is in talks to manufacture Rubin's new smartphone, according to people familiar with the matter. At least one prototype of Rubin's phone boasts a screen larger than the iPhone 7 Plus's (5.5-inches) but has a smaller overall footprint because of the lack of bezels, one of the people said.   RUBIN'S DOG TAKES ON A ROBOT   While at Google's Rubin's dog hit the headlines after taking on a robot. A feisty terrier has taken on Boston Dynamics' 'Spot' dog by barking at it and even giving chase, showing that in the event of a robot uprising, dogs will still be man's best friend.The dog, named Cosmo, is said to belong to Andy Rubin, the co-founder of Android, who has previously managed the robotics program at Google. Google acquired Boston Dymamics, which makes numerous sized robotic animals in differing sizes, including Spot, which can run, climb stairs, jog next to its owner and even cope with being kicked.

MailOnline puts Sony's XB40 to the test Sony SRS-XB40 has a built-in multi-coloured line light, speaker lights and a flashing strobe. It features 24 hours of battery life and claims to be a 'mini-disco on the move'. But does it live up to the claim? Samsung's Galaxy S8: A hefty price tag and a dumb personal assistant Samsung's new Galaxy S8 phone is stunning, but its $100 price hike is hard to swallow. Overall the S8 is for those who want elegance - and are willing to pay for it. Affordable, robust and surprisingly responsive: Samsung's Galaxy A5 With the eagerly awaited Galaxy S8 having been pushed back, South Korea-based Samsung has plugged the gap with the Samsung Galaxy A5, a high-end device with a mid-range price tag. Is it really worth paying £280 for Nintendo's Switch? MailOnline's verdict While the design is impressive and easy to use, the game line up is disappointing. Google's Daydream: The $79 headset that could bring VR to the masses Google's $79 headset is superb in terms of hardware - but is currently let down by a lack of apps. However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant. It's the king of the Android handsets - but still not great. Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats. The $1,000 wireless speaker that really IS worth the price: Naim Mu-so Qb review Naim's incredible Mu-So Qb takes you back to the good old days - where the music captivates and enthralls, rather that simply being something in the background. The hi-tech $2,000 spin bike that really could change your life Peloton's hi-tech bike lets you stream live and on demand rides to your home - and it's one of the best examples of fitness technology out there - at a price. Apple's new 9.7inch iPad Pro is a powerhouse you can take anywhere Apple has added a few improvements to the smaller version, creating a tablet that is astonishingly powerful, but, unlike its big brother, is something you'll be able to carry everywhere. Speaker that looks as good as its sounds: B&W Zeppelin Wireless review It's not cheap, but the $699 (£500) Zeppelin Wireless is perfect for the design conscious music fan. The best all in one wireless speaker you'll ever hear: Naim Mu-so review It might not be a name familiar to the US market, but Naim is a legendary British brand hoping to make a splash with the American launch of its $1499 Mu:So speaker.

(Chinatopix via AP) By The Washington Post | PUBLISHED: May 26, 2017 at 1:38 pm | UPDATED: May 27, 2017 at 6:31 am By Hamza Shaban, (c) 2017, The Washington Post AI: 2, Humanity: 0. A computer designed by Google researchers has beaten the world’s top Go player for the second game in a row, capturing the best-of-three match in Wuzhen, China, and confirming AI’s supremacy in what many consider as one of humanity’s most complex boardgames. Ke Jie, a 19-year-old Go grandmaster, began the game with stellar play, said Demis Hassabis, the CEO of DeepMind, the artificial intelligence firm that created AlphaGo, at a press conference. Google acquired his company in 2014. But the Chinese prodigy was eventually bested by AlphaGo. In South Korea last year, DeepMind’s machine defeated another championship-caliber player, Lee Sedol, stunning some in the field of artificial intelligence. “For the first 100 moves it was the closest we’ve ever seen anyone play against the Master version of AlphaGo,” Hassabis said after the game. “Today’s game was different from the first,” Ke said Thursday at the press conference. “AlphaGo made some moves which were opposite from my vision of how to maximize the possibility of winning. I also thought I was very close to winning the game in the middle but maybe that’s not what AlphaGo was thinking.” AlphaGo’s sudden dominance over human competitors has surprised AI researchers, who had suspected that machines would take much more time to master the intricacies of Go. The program began as a research project three years ago. In a 2016 Nature article, Google said that AlphaGo had beaten European champion Fan Hui, five games to zero, in a match that took place during the previous October, behind closed doors. That marked the first time any computer program had beaten a professional player at Go. The program went on to beat more stand out players. AlphaGo’s wins have revealed the ways that computers can augment human capability and spur new ways of thinking. And more broadly, the computer program’s feat helps validate a more optimistic take on the future of automation and AI, one in which humans aren’t necessarily displaced, but are enhanced in some way. This week’s match in China also demonstrated the very human limitations that can surface amid competition, primarily how stress and emotions can hinder decision making.”I was very excited. I could feel my heart bumping,” Ke said after the game. “Maybe because I was too excited I made some stupid moves.” Beyond the game of Go, DeepMind scientists believe that the technology that powers AlphaGo can help societies develop better ways to conserve energy and boost health research. The third and final game pitting Ke against AlphaGo will take place on Saturday, as part of Google’s “Future of Go Summit.” Another match will feature two professional human players facing one another, but each will have their own AlphaGo teammate.

There is now a new “Personal” tab (via Search Engine Roundtable) on the web and mobile to quickly see these results from your various Google apps. Nintendo Switch “Personal” is the newest filter in Google Search that helps users fine-tune results by content type, like Images, News, Shopping, etc. Depending on the query, Google usually reorders the tabs to list the most relevant filters first. However, for the moment, it appears that the Personal tab is always the last item in the “More” menu. This is the case through multiple search terms that readily bring up Gmail and Calendar cards in the main “All” tab. The most common result that appears under Personal are messages from Gmail, with around 10 messages appearing in a card. Tapping one will immediately open the full message in a tab, with the option to load in Gmail. Results from Calendar and Photos work similarly, with the latter immediately opening up the image, with a “View all Google Photos results” link at the bottom of the card offering to perform a full search in Photos. Similar to the rest of Google Search, ads do appear in the Personal tab, but at the very bottom underneath cards and results on the web. The Personal tab appears to be widely rolled out, with users first seeing the filter yesterday. Available on the web and mobile, it does not appear in the Google app for Android.

The addition of the tab was first reported by Search Engine Roundtable, which spotted the change earlier today. The Personal tab works similarly to the way the existing Maps, News, or Images tabs work — instead of showing you a search for links, it just takes the entered search terms and shows you results from your Google accounts instead. The Personal tab doesn’t show up by default — you’ll have to click through to the “More” option; it’ll be on the bottom. Google seems to be slowly rolling out the feature to users. In an informal polling of Verge staffers, most didn’t have it enabled yet. If you do have the Personal tab, though, the feature works on both the web and mobile versions of Google. We’ve reached out to Google for more information as to when users can expect to see the Personal filter on their own accounts, and will continue to update this post as we get more information.

Lidar is technology that uses near-infrared light to detect the shape of objects around it. next play/pause pre Waterloo Region Record By John R. Quain Giant tech companies are fighting over the technology in court. Startups around the world are racing to develop new versions of it. And engineers say it is essential to making autonomous cars safe. The obscure object of desire: lidar. "We believe it will be the basis for autonomous driving," said Guillaume Devauchelle, who oversees innovation at Valeo, a major parts supplier to automakers. The technology, which uses near-infrared light to detect the shape of objects around it, is the centrepiece of an intense court fight in California between Uber and Waymo, the self-driving business operated by Google's parent, Alphabet. In the case, Waymo accuses a former Google engineer, Anthony Levandowski, of stealing trade secrets about the company's lidar designs for his own autonomous driving startup — which he sold to Uber for nearly $700 million. Lidar — pronounced LIE-dar — is shorthand for light detection and ranging. It is a type of sensor that is at the heart of many autonomous car designs and is critical to several worldwide high-resolution mapping efforts. The same technology is used to delineate terrain from airplanes and detect speeding violations. The advantage of lidar is that it can generate precise three-dimensional images of everything from cars to trees to cyclists in a variety of environments and under a variety of lighting conditions. While autonomous car designs use numerous sensors, including ultrasonic, radar and video camera components, lidar has unique abilities. Unlike cameras, for example, lidar cannot be fooled by shadows or blinded by bright sunlight. The biggest hurdle to widespread lidar adoption is an economic one, and that is where the battle is being waged. When Google initially started its autonomous vehicle research eight years ago, the lidar sensors it used cost roughly $75,000. Those sensors were made by Velodyne Lidar, an industry leader. Velodyne declined to say what the current pricing is for such systems, but Waymo's chief executive, John Krafcik, said in a recent presentation that his company had reduced the cost of its lidar system by 90 per cent. But even at $7,500, such systems are seen as too expensive to meet automakers' demands. "Car companies want it to cost $100 and perform 10 times better, be smaller — and very reliable," said Omer Keilaf, chief executive of Innoviz Technologies, a lidar developer based in Israel. "So there's a big vacuum in the industry right now." The race to fill that void is largely focused on producing solid-state lidar systems, which would shrink the size of the sensors, eliminate moving parts involved in the optical mechanisms and enable the kind of mass manufacturing that could bring costs down, said Hongbo Zhang, a research associate at Virginia Tech who is working on a lidar design. Established automotive suppliers, such as Velodyne and Valeo; technology companies like Waymo and Uber; and relative newcomers like Innoviz, LeddarTech and Quanergy all have their sights set on making less expensive sensors. Luminar Technologies, a lidar company that recently came out of stealth mode, is focusing on improving the performance of sensors by extending the effective range of lidar past 200 metres. (Top-of-the-line sensors now have a range of 120 metres.) Austin Russell, Luminar's chief executive, said the company accomplished the longer range by using a more sensitive receiver, as well as a more powerful light output that remains safe enough to avoid damaging people's vision. Velodyne, which says it is the only current third-party lidar supplier for fully autonomous vehicles now being tested, is well aware that startups are gunning for its business. Velodyne is working on its own solid-state Velarray lidar sensor, said Mike Jellen, Velodyne president, and it plans to start mass-producing them next year in a 200,000-square-foot factory in San Jose. While there has been considerable speculation about how Velodyne will face the potential price competition, Jellen declined to estimate how much the new sensors might cost, saying only that a complete lidar sensor package for future vehicles might be priced in the "low thousands" per vehicle. Other companies building complete autonomous driving packages expect prices to fall faster. "In five years, for ridesharing cars, it could be an $8,000" option, said Jeffrey Owens, chief technology officer for Delphi. Delphi recently announced it was working with Intel, BMW and Mobileye on an autonomous driving platform. "In 2025, it could be $5,000," he said. "The problem is that we're still in AI learning mode and only buying in quantities of a couple-thousand," said Jellen, referring to artificial intelligence. "The problem is, the market isn't there yet." There are also some technical kinks that need to be ironed out with new systems. Different versions of lidar paint images of the world around them in different ways, said Zhang at Virginia Tech. That means different lidar sensors from different companies cannot simply be exchanged for one another on an autonomous BMW or Ford vehicle. How a car is trained and learns will partly depend on the specific type of lidar used. Despite these challenges, Keilaf of Innoviz and many others say there will not be fully autonomous cars without lidar — and it will have to be cheap. It will also have to meet exceptionally high standards. "An autonomous vehicle that's 99 per cent safe won't be good enough," said Russell of Luminar. "This is mission critical. You can't afford to miss a single object because that object could be a person."

Let alone trying to dial in with the help of Google's voice assistant. The good news is that these can be easily managed and organized. From your phone Android's stock phone app should be the first thing to try. Go to your Contacts -- we tried this on LG and Samsung phones, but depending on your phone's brand it can be a little different -- on the app, tap the Menu button > Manage Contacts > then select Merge. A screen with all repeated contacts will show up, so you can confirm which you want to merge one by one. From your desktop browser / Google Contacts A second method is made available from your Google Account. Log in to your Gmail Account and then go to your Contacts (or enter directly from this link). On the right sidebar there's a "Duplicates" option, which will show a list with all the candidates to be merged. Select "Merge" on each and you're done. An additional word of caution The two alternatives above are easy and accessible default options that Google provides to merge contacts. Unless you have thousands of contacts and hundreds of duplicates, they should serve you well. But an additional word of caution. There are a ton of "free" apps on the Play Store to merge contacts, however even if some of those promise to automatically merge with one click, we wouldn't compromise on security by letting a third-party ask for Google account credentials solely for this purpose. 5 days, 5 killer tech tips is a TechSpot monthly feature On the third week of every month, we'll publish 5 killer tech tips, one for each day of the week for a given app, service, or platform.

(Photo by Jeff Gritchen, Orange County Register/SCNG) Show Caption of Expand   Five minutes into a test for memory, I’m pretty sure I’m really dumb, I’ve lost my mind — or both. Yeah, yeah, I know based on some of my columns some would vote both. But cut me some slack. Unknown to many people — like me — the earlier Alzheimer’s disease is detected, the better the chance of stopping it. Related Articles How an Orange County doctor is slowing Alzheimer’s progression in this patient Experts report that it can be delayed for as long as two decades. For many baby boomers, that means a lifetime. The Orange County Vital Brain Aging Program advises that if you are 45 or older get checked. The Alzheimer’s Association is looser. It’s basically if you can’t remember how to use the microwave, get tested. After talking to a Mission Viejo finance guy named Ted Esau whose dad died with Alzheimer’s, I’m taking no chances. Better early testing than wondering why I interviewed someone. I arrive at the Hoag Neurosciences Institute in Newport Beach and Celine Keeble, education and screening coordinator, explains the test in detail with patience and a smile. She rattles off a list of words. I’m a little overwhelmed and feel I’m lucky if I’m reciting back half. Photographer Jeff Gritchen is nearby, and I’m pretty sure he’s wondering about my sanity. I just hope he doesn’t report back to our version of Editor Perry White (Clark Kent’s boss, if I recall correctly) that one of his columnists is bonkers. Slowing Alzheimer’s The day starts badly. Even Google is forgetful. She — yes, my Google is a woman — sends me on a detour around a non-existent traffic jam. I arrive late to the institute next to Hoag Hospital. Honest, it was Google’s fault that I didn’t know where to go. Thanks to a subsidy from the institute and community donations, the Vital Brain Aging Program, OCBrain.org, only charges $45 and parking is free. As I register, I fill out a card that will be mailed next year reminding me to come in for re-testing. But what if I don’t recall the previous test? The receptionist laughs. They’ll call. I fill out a list of questions that are similar to an online self-assessment that the program offers at OCBrain.org. They include memory, depression, risk factors. Since the program began seven years ago, some 4,500 local residents have had assessments. More than 25 percent were referred to their primary care physician for a check-up. But three-fourths of those tested were over 64 — well after most experts advise to start testing. Much of the reason for getting tested is creating a baseline. If the following year’s result is lower, adjustments in behavior, diet and medicine can be made. Sometimes, Keeble says, the next test shows improved memory. Ways to protect memory include managing medical conditions, exercising at least three days a week for 30 minutes, maintaining a healthy weight, getting seven to eight hours sleep, having low cholesterol, challenging your mind. Dr. William Shankle is program director for memory and cognitive disorders at the Hoag Neurosciences Institute. “The big change in my field,” he says, “is that we do have the ability to test for (impairment) with a simple memory test while someone is still functioning normally.” But Shankle adds that it’s a challenge to convince people that memory testing is as normal and as useful as getting a blood test. UC Irvine Institute for Memory Impairments and Neurological Disorders, too, offers test opportunities. Its focus is research participation. The website is Mind.uci.edu. Of those tested through the Orange County Vital Brain Aging Program, 23 percent were impaired. More men than women were impaired. And — as expected — cognitive ability declined as people aged. But not as much as you might expect. Through age 75, fewer than 10 percent of participants were found impaired. By age 84, that reached 40 percent. By 94, it was close to 75 percent. But, mind you, being impaired includes a wide range of abilities from simple memory loss to serious Alzheimer’s. Keeble asks a list of questions. I admit to some depression, a little memory loss. When vinyl rocked the world, I could reel off the band members of Led Zeppelin. But now, I sometimes mix up John Bonham (drums) and John Paul Jones (bass). I know. Shameful, right? While Keeble compiles my results, she points out depression and stress can affect memory. Fear of testing Keeble is in the field nearly every day. She reports one of the toughest things she encounters is fear. People are afraid they might be getting Alzheimer’s. Yet often it’s simple aging or normal forgetfulness. When I was in my 20s, I sometimes locked my keys in my car. I still do. (Yes, I keep a spare.) I misplace my wallet. Years ago, I found it in the freezer. Recently, I found it in the garbage. Still, Keeble encounters true Alzheimer’s. “Some people cry,” Keeble says. “It’s true there’s no cure,” she acknowledges. “But there are lots of things that be done that can impact the quality of life.” Engaging different areas of the brain helps create connections, she explains. Being creative and problem-solving are key. Learning to do something new such as salsa dancing or taking up piano combine a variety of things that help with protecting memory. As we wrap up, Keeble hands me a sheet of paper. It is my memory screen results. There are no right or wrong answers. But there is an intricate interplay in the questions that test a variety of brain functions. The document says: “Normal memory.” For a test appointment: 949-764-6288. I’ll be back next year.

Google Earth, the software program that allows users to virtually explore our planet through topographic maps, satellite imagery, and more, relaunched last month with a suite of new features including guided tours of buildings by Frank Gehry and Zaha Hadid. Teaming up with storytellers, scientists, and nonprofits from around the world, Google created “Voyager,” a showcase of interactive guided tours that take users from the mountains, islands, and jungles of the world courtesy of BBC Earth’s “Natural Treasures” to treks on the Galápagos Islands to discoveries of Machu Picchu. As part of Voyager, Google Earth has compiled a tour of six Hadid-designed structures including the MAXXI museum in Rome, the Contemporary Arts Center in Cincinnati, and the headquarters of Belgium’s Port Authority in Antwerp. Eight of Gehry’s buildings are also featured, and they include the Vitra Design Museum in Weil am Rhein, Germany, the Frederick R. Weisman Art Museum in Minneapolis, the Cinémathèque Française in Paris, and the Dancing House in Prague. Each map point comes with a brief description and the ability to view the structure in 3D or 2D (aerial). This view also provides crucial geographic and spacial context that allows virtual visitors to see the surrounding neighborhoods and cities in which the buildings stand. Other features include “Knowledge Cards” and the ability to experience a locale in 3D and see it from every angle. The relaunch comes just days before Earth Day and is available on the web in Chrome and on Android, rolling out soon.

Generally speaking, Android TV was not hugely on the agenda, but at the same time, it did make a big impression. This is because Google took the opportunity to announce that a new interface was coming to Android TV. This is an interface designed to work with Android O, and if you do own a Nexus Player and know how to install the developer preview of Android O, then you can actually check out the new interface now. We already did take a closer look at the new interface when it was first shown off at Google I/O, and also a more in-depth look with our own Nexus Player (in the video below), so most of what is to be expected, is already known. The interface is very different from what is currently available on Android TV, as it does look to bring more focus to specific content. Which is a good thing. Although, at the same time, the early impressions left from the new interface is that less content is initially available. That is, there is less content available on-screen, at any given time. For instance, to access your apps on the new interface, you now have to click through to a dedicated app slide-out menu. Not a big deal, but not as quick as it was before – when they were all in view, all the time. This inevitably means there is now a very clear focus on select apps. Which does pose one particular issue going forward, as developers will need to take advantage of the relevant APIs to ensure that their apps are also able to adopt and make use of the new layout. If not, then those apps might not be as easily as accessible as before. In fact, Google even released a new developer posting on this on Thursday, further introducing the new layout and presumably, looking to garner interest from the developer side. The post specifically highlights that the new interface is “content-centric” and “organizes video content into channels and programs in a way that’s familiar to TV viewers.” While on that surface that sounds great, is it? After all, while flipping through channels on a TV is “familiar to TV viewers,” it is arguably, not a great experience, and certainly not the best experience for a device that mainly adopts an app-based UI. Which is largely the point here. If you are to take away anything from Google I/O 2017 on Android TV, then the new layout itself, is not the thing to focus on. That is the red herring here. What is much more important to understand is that Google (and the Android TV team specifically) no longer view Android TV as an app-based entity. Instead, it seems Android TV is going to become much more of a channel-based product going forward. Something that is clearly apparent in the terminology now being used by Google and the Android TV team, as they no longer refer to Android TV apps as apps, but instead, “channels.” While it can be debated as to whether that is a good thing or not, what is clear is that the success of this approach will largely depend on whether developers take to the new interface or not. After all, once this interface and channel-centric approach does become much more readily available on third-party Android TV devices, it will be up to those Android TV ‘channel’ developers to create and maintain their apps as channels. Which seems like it could be a lot of work for developers of lesser-known apps. As it is already an issue getting standard Android apps ported over to Android TV. These apps therefore, could end up becoming more of a background feature on Android TV devices, with your mainstream HBO, DIRECTV, Netflix, and so on, taking more of a center stage. While none of this will matter in the grand scheme of things – as those same ‘background apps’ will still be accessible through the system, they will no longer naturally be able to command as much prime real estate on the leanback launcher as they once did – and certainly not as much as the big-name options will. If that is the case, then while this might be a ‘channel-centric’ approach, you might also find that it is becoming a little more provider-centric, and less user-centric. Something that the most skeptical of people could focus on in more detail if they wanted – providers = revenue. While that is all just food for thought for now, unfortunately, there was not much else Android TV-based on offer at this year’s event. Google did briefly touch on Google Assistant compatibility with Android TV, but that touching was brief, with no further or firm details provided on when it will actually become available. Much was the case with the developer posting that came through yesterday. With the announcement simply detailing that the Google Assistant is “coming later this year.” Post navigation Download: Google Maps v9.54 Has Code for Notification Channels Samsung DeX Now Available in Canada for $249 May 26, 2017 | Android News , Android TV News , Special Features Show Comments Hide Comments () Latest News Wi-Fi Certification Granted For Leaked Samsung Galaxy A4 2017 Carriers Exchange Spectrum Licenses After FCC Auctions Pick Up the Google Chromecast Ultra for $59 – 6/4/17 Stream Live Games with MLB’s At Bat VR App & Google Daydream Android 7.1.1 Rolling Out to the Nextbit Robin Deal: Google Home for just $105 – 6/2/17 The ‘Lenovo Moto’ Brand Is No More, Motorola CMO Suggests Leaked OnePlus 5 Sketch Shows Horizontal Dual Camera Setup Samsung Display Files Five New Display Design Patents Stephen Curry NBA Edition of Vivo X9 Released Facebook’s Latest Tweak Expands Album’s Features 2017 Chevrolet Bolt EV Review: Android Auto Goes Electric Pick Up a Tronsmart 18W Quick Charge 3.0 USB Wall Charger for $11.59 – 6/3/17 First Ever Cross-Carrier RCS Interconnect in NA Established You Can Watch A Stork’s Journey For Free On Play Movies & TV Essential Accused Of Trademark Infringement By Spigen Report: Facebook’s Talk Is A Teen App, Controlled By Parents Pick Up a Samsung Galaxy S7 for just $229 – 6/1/17 Google Confirms Archive Suggestions For Google Photos Android Nougat Release Notes Are Up For The Moto X Play Kyocera DA58 Passes Through The FCC Load More Posts Follow Share

The new group will be separate from Google parent-company Alphabet's existing venture arms, CapitalG and GV, according to Axios. The new investment initiative suggests a greater alignment with Google CEO Sundar Pichai's "AI first" strategy. Jordan Novet | @jordannovet Friday, 26 May 2017 | 3:38 PM ETCNBC.com SHARES Getty Images Google CEO Sundar Pichai Google has established a new organization to invest in artificial intelligence startups, according to a new report. The new effort shows Google taking its experience with venture capital and applying it to AI, a type of computing that it has been increasingly using across its applications. The new organization will be separate from Google parent company Alphabet's funding activity within GV (formerly Google Ventures) and CapitalG (formerly Google Capital), Axios reported on Friday. Google itself has also made venture investments on its own. Google chief executive Sundar Pichai in the past year has started positioning the company as being "AI first" as opposed to being "mobile first." Having an investment group focusing on that does make sense given that thesis. show chapters Google pushes further into virtual reality by building standalone VR headsets    Thursday, 18 May 2017 | 3:47 PM ET | 01:37 Google has dedicated AI research groups including DeepMind, whose AlphaGo AI Go player earlier this week beat the top human Go player, Ke Jie. Google uses AI in its search engine, Gmail, Google Maps, Google Photos, and Google Translate, among other things. Startups who take on funding from the new group can receive mentorship, as well as services and space to operate, Axios said. AI startups have many places to go to for money, including other corporate venture arms and institutional venture capital firms. But having backing from the new group could provide a particular mark of legitimacy at a time when so many startups today claim to be using AI. Google declined to comment.

Google's Verify Apps now shows apps that it has recently scanned Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/02/13 12:51pm PDTFeb 13, 2017 24 Plus 1 on G+ 66 Share on Facebook 56 Share on Twitter Total Shares146 Google News Google rolled out the Verify Apps framework many years ago to scan apps as they were installed. Then, in 2014 it added the ability to constantly scan apps to watch for malicious behavior. You were sort of taking Google at its word as a user that Verify Apps was indeed rummaging around to keep tabs on things. Now you can see some of what it's doing—the settings menu now shows which apps have recently been scanned. The Verify Apps menu is buried quite deep. It won't even appear when searching the settings. You'll find it under Google > Security > Verify Apps. That last jump wasn't available before. There were only a few settings toggles for Verify Apps, and they were in the main Google security menu. Now, there's a section at the top with four app icons of the apps most recently scanned, along with the time the last scan was completed. This seems to have popped up in the last few weeks via an update to Google Play Services. I've confirmed that a phone with a 10.0.x build did not have the updated menu, and a phone running v10.2.x did have it. This appears to only be a cosmetic tweak. The icons are not interactive and no additional information is provided. It's just a little extra peace of mind. Thanks: Alexander Blur Tags Google play services security verify apps subscribe ...

There were only a few settings toggles for Verify Apps, and they were in the main Google security menu." I can't understand why that whole sub menu is not part of the main security section in setting. Lateef Alabi-Oki Because Verify Apps is part of Google Play Services, not Android. Peter Smart Lock is also from Google Play Services but that's included in the main Security settings. I think Verify Apps in it's previous incarnation was included in the main security settings back in KitKat era. Lateef Alabi-Oki Good point. MJ Ummmm Google Play services is part of Android. All security setting in one spot and not hidden makes sense to me. Lateef Alabi-Oki Google Play Services is not part of Android. Although, I do agree that security settings should be found in one place. MJ I can't believe two people upvoted your totally wrong statement. A phone OEM can't even say their phone has Android on it without passing the CTS and being a GMS partner (aka license it from Google) which part of that is installing the Google Play services. No one is running AOSP on their phone. LOL Please let me know what legit Android phone OEM doesn't ship phones with Google Play services? Lateef Alabi-Oki Huawei, Xiaomi and a horde of Chinese, Indian and Russian OEMs ship Android phones without GPS. Saying Google Play Services is part of Android is like saying Gmail, or Google Maps, or Google Chrome is part of Android. Because an app or service ships with most Android devices doesn't make it part of Android. There's a real and technical demarcation between Android APIs and Google specific APIs. Google Play Services falls under Google specific APIs. MJ Thanks, no one cares about Chinese phone sold in China. LOL Google Play services is an app like Gmail. What? I guess you still understand difference between Android the OS distribution that comes on your phone and AOSP (which nobody runs). Who knew Fire tablets ran Android. Thanks for your input... Lateef Alabi-Oki This is not about "winning" arguments. There's no argument to be had. There are facts, and then there are alternatives facts. The fact of the matter is that Google services and apps are not part of Android. Also on Android, an app is basically a service that has a UI. So the difference between a service like Google Play Services and an app like Gmail is conspicuously superficial. MJ I agree this is no argument because what you are saying is incorrect. Again, Google decides what can be called Android...not you or me. Period. End of story. Lateef Alabi-Oki My Nexus 7 2013 is running LineageOS, the 3rd party Android ROM formerly known as CyanogenMod. I haven't flashed Gapps on it. So no Google Play Services or Google Play Store. Are you saying that device is not running Android? Because when I go to the about section of the device, it clearly tells me it's running Android Nougat. So pray tell me what this device is running if it's not Android? MJ They don't charge money for that huh? LOL Yes, they can't include Gapps or Play services with it because they don't have a license with Google. Please try to produce a phone or a custom ROM that you charge for and call it Android then try to sell that in the US. Amazon can't even do that... LineageOS is an OS based on AOSP but it's NOT Android which is an brand. This is why I say Play Services is part of Android because it is required if you want to call it Android. Lateef Alabi-Oki A device that passes the Android Compatibility Test Suite can be called Android. I don't know where you get the idea that a device that doesn't include Gapps or Play Services cannot be called Android. And no, Play Services is not part of Android. Here's a link to the official Android architecture. Please point me to where you see Play Services. https://source.android.com/devices/index.html Here's a link with the requirements to pass the Android Compatibility Test Suite. Once again, please point me to where Play Services is a requirement to build or sell Android devices with or without the Android brand. https://source.android.com/compatibility/index.html Here's a link about GMS licensing. Note where it says GMS, which includes Play Services, is not part of Android and only runs on top of Android. I'll bold that for you. After building an Android compatible device, consider licensing Google Mobile Services (GMS), Google’s proprietary suite of apps (Google Play, YouTube, Google Maps, Gmail, and more ) that run on top of Android. GMS is not part of the Android Open Source Project and is available only through a license with Google. For information on how to request a GMS license, see Contact Us. https://source.android.com/compatibility/index.html#licensing-gms MJ I never said Google Play services is part of AOSP and I have said the opposite. LOL Again, I have talking about Android the BRAND. I know AOSP exists but no phone runs that. The only reply I am interested is the answer to this question --> What phone can I buy in the US that doesn't have Google Play services installed? Thanks again for your input... Lateef Alabi-Oki Again, the criteria for labelling a devices as an Android device has nothing to do with Google Play Services or geographic location. Even Google says Google Play Services is not part of Android. As I've linked numerous times from Google and Android official sites, you can brand your device as Android as long as it passes the CTS. As for Android devices that don't have Play Services in the US, Amazon and Ebay are rife with them. I bought a Xiaomi device without Google Play Services on Ebay a few years ago. It was advertised and branded as an Android (TM) device. Lateef Alabi-Oki In addition to my above response, even more proof that Google Play Services and the Google Apps are not part of Android. How can I get access to the Google apps for Android, such as Maps? The Google apps for Android, such as YouTube, Google Maps, Gmail, and more, are Google properties that are not part of Android and are licensed separately. Contact [email protected] for inquiries related to those apps. https://source.android.com/source/faqs.html Andy Roid MJ just got blown the f out JD Because fuck consistency and common sense, it's the Google way that's why. Sruly J I like the improvement which Google has made to how security works. I took an old phone and tried installing an APK infected by ransomware. Right away it for picked up by Verify Apps. Peter Please can you post a screenshot of what happens when Verify Apps does it's thing. Sruly J I'll try later. Gotta find the APK again. Peter Thanks. Sruly J @Paul_Werner:disqus @disqus_Jj8ZZd6BPC:disqus Verify Apps blocks APK installation completely for dangerous apps. In this case, it blocked the installation of ransomware. I turned Verify Apps off, and app installation worked. When/if I get an alert later about the app, I'll post it here. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d72838119f33f71993c32d9a48055d77b75ff7512b196b70a09a15e2b00d45e9.jpg Sruly J @Paul_Werner:disqus @disqus_Jj8ZZd6BPC:disqus I changed the time on the phone to initiate scanning, then changed it back.

Paul_Werner Nice, I'd be interested in seeing this too Suicide_Note APKPLZ!! Sruly J Sorry. I don't think APKMirror will accept it. ;) Shockingly though, it's really easy to find. 1 apk site removed it, a different one still has it available. Artem Russakovskii Yeah, we definitely won't. Sruly J I should hope not. It would be awful for numerous reasons. thunderqus is there automated process which will identify infected APK uploaded on APKMirror or you will need to manually approve or remove it?

Vivek Rameses People actually use this setting? This is one of the first things I disable after setting up my devices. Sruly J Out of curiosity, why? Jason Farrell Probably because he thinks he can handle security manually (dumb), and it'd just slow the phone down (wrong).

SMS support for Hangouts officially ends today, excluding Google Voice and Project Fi subscribers Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/22 2:29pm PDTMay 22, 2017 101 Plus 1 on G+ 289 Share on Facebook 105 Share on Twitter Total Shares495 Applications Google News Videos Today is the day that Hangouts finally loses SMS support. We were warned by Google about it months ago when Hangouts started showing a warning that it would no longer support the feature. But, as of today, it's finally set to happen. For anyone who isn't on Project Fi or Google Voice — both of which will continue to support SMS in Hangouts — this is the end of an era. Many people, myself included, made the final push into Hangouts over other services when SMS support was added. The integrated conversations made it much easier to keep short communications together in one place. So far there's no word on if SMS support will be coming to Allo. Now that Hangouts support for SMS is finally over, we aren't really left with a clear migration method. Anyone that might have made use of it will have to either deal with using two separate apps again or move over to a new service. If you are looking for recommendations, Google's stock Android Messages isn't so bad. But, if you've been enjoying having SMS and chats merged, that isn't really a solution. Allo is always an option. But, that's the same issue from the other side, you'd still need to find a way to send SMS messages. There's always Facebook Messenger or Signal, which both provide a combined SMS and chat solution. Each has its disadvantages, though. The latter doesn't have quite the same feature set that Hangouts did, and the former is a Facebook product. Either way, it's closing time. You might have just enough left to send one last SMS before the lights are shut off. If you still plan on using Hangouts for chats going forward, make sure you've updated to the latest version over at Google Play or APKMirror. Download QR-Code Hangouts Developer: Google Inc.

Good_Ole_Pinocchio Google doesn't care about you. humulos A truer statement has never been said Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2c9aad5a41d09ce24c4c4e04e7b3a28a2004487ff015df2fc519b5c2a9556024.gif Adrien Aubel Google's messaging strategy is now: - Android Messages for carriers & OEMs - meaning strictly SMS/RCS - Allo for their new consumer messaging service, and the focus of their upcoming work - Hangouts for business/enterprise Nothing personal :) humulos How innocent we once were, at the time when we witnessed Talk, Voice, SMS and G+ Messages become a single product, fulfilling all our dreams. Undone in naught but a few years, with this final limb being ripped from the body. But I guess I'm on Project Fi, so I'm good for now. My parents weren't happy about this news, since our family communicates primarily on large Hangouts threads. mxwp but if they are using actual Hangouts IM threads and not SMS they can still use Hangouts Shannon Butler Home-based mummy Kelly Richards from New York after quitting from her fulltime occupation has able to make from $26000 to $28000 on a monthly basis from freelancing in the house... This is just one way she successfully done it >>> learn by clicking here how to do it right now humulos For sure, and they still do. They just don't like having to use multiple apps for messaging. Adrien Aubel IMHO those big plans haven't been followed by strict coding/design rules, and Hangouts became progressively a technical mess, then a true nightmare for anybody to work on, with the UI becoming slower with each version, fortunately partly compensated by faster phones. To be fair, SMS/MMS can be very complicated to deal with, and Android development was much harder and potentially messy when Babel has been developed, the technologies available nowadays would have helped a lot. So down the road it would have been neither productive or future-proof to keep iterating all efforts inside Hangouts, at least without a total recode from the ground up. Right now I wonder if they will indeed clean the code up to remove all carrier SMS/MMS, and eventually speed up the app and make it smaller, or just roughly disable it. t_newt If Hangouts became a technical mess, the solution isn't to drop Hangouts, it's to fix Hangouts. They could have made it a framework for their products that any of their messengers could be installed into. Instead they are trying to make it an enterprise Slack competitor. What company is going to trust their company to Google's leftovers? "SMS/MMS can be very complicated to deal with". Apparently this is true at Google. Duder12 They aren't getting the left overs. They are getting two brand new products. Hangouts Meet and Hangouts Chat. OhYeah! 2 products solving a problem that the last hangouts solved already in one app. Great nigra truo Well, that is why we use whatsapp, does a lot more and is just one application and while Americans are backwards in Whatsapp use, it is the world wide defacto standard, many people that use Whatsapp have not written a SMS in year and I know that for me it is a pain in the ass, because it is of lousy reliabilty, often you don't know if the person received the message, much less if they have read it, you can't record voice memos of unlimited length, can't voice call or video call them and it is not encrypted ( functions that whatsapp supports natively) Here is a little comparison of SMS vs Whatsapp: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1StygzfbH0eSg7gwCgPUdpenzDeTbsuwKk3dMiG-BGQY/edit?usp=sharing It is not hard to see that it will replace SMS, as it already has for 1 billion people. pfmiller SMS can be complicated to deal with, but it's not dealt with by Hangouts. The OS handles SMS itself and then gives whichever SMS app you select access to the SMS message database. Adrien Aubel If you mean that the app doesn't have to interact directly with the radio, you're right. But the APIs provided for SMS/MMS by Google are nonetheless very tricky to integrate beautifully with. For example, the ContentProvider could be so much cleaner to interact with, and some OEMs like Samsung crash on non-simple queries. Another example is that most apps ship their own MMS logic, usually based on Google's own sources ( https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/services/Mms/+/master/ ), in case the carrier or OEM customized the system MMS logic and made it not work properly with apps other than their own, or if the system isn't configured correctly, and let the user the option to switch between this logic ("Legacy") and their system when it comes to send MMS. We could expect better from an OS serving 2B active users, but I'm glad it's at least open to 3rd party apps, unlike iOS. JG Personally, rather than spinning Allo off as its own new app, I would have preferred Google to treat it as the next major update to Hangouts. Have the team re-work the app from the ground up, streamlining the code, etc. If I'm not mistaking, around that time, Facebook and Shazam were launching their own reworked Lite app versions designed to use less bandwidth, storage and resources. Reworking Hangouts would have followed suite. Essentially, Google could have made their first Go ready app a year or so early. Hangouts already has a large username, and it has all of the features users have been asking for - cross device/platform and SMS support. And I don't think the is any issue with SMS being a challenge to implement as they have their own SMS app, Android Messages which send to work well enough to be the default app to push RCS. It shouldn't be too hard to fold it (and the Assistant) into Hangouts while streamlining it. My name is…. Nobody ever used Hangouts for SMS outside America. Actually, nobidy uses SMS no more. There DOES exist a world outside America, you know, and its much bigger!! sproc Haha, you wish. Everyone I know is stuck on sms. They try whatsapp and stuff then abandon it. Adrien Aubel Especially iOS users, who already have a great "Messages" app that outsmarts SMS when possible. For them it doesn't make too much sense to download another messaging app every now and then. Rodrigo Gomes da Silva So.. where are you from? Jay No you wish, but you must be in the states. No one i know uses SMS anymore. It's an archaic dead service, only used for bank transaction notifications and amazon deliveries. Everyone else is either on whatsapp (yes 220 million of us in this country and growing at 4 million a month) or (wechat which is like what 85-90 percent of China) No one cares for SMS. xyz And where do you live? America. We already know. TheDrunkenClam What an unnecessarily smug and nagging comment. Winston Well it's true, even if it's smug. Outside the US, SMS is pretty much dead as we've all moved towards WhatsApp, as carriers still don't give unlimited texts by default. I think it's time to start asking another company for SMS integration. Christopher Gannon That would work if so many people in the US weren't using iMessage, where the only way a non-apple user can chat is via SMS. Then apple makes it very difficult NOT to use it, so good luck convincing your friends to give up siri, etc. I'd also like a solution, like hangouts or iMessage, where messages aren't restricted to a phone, and I can seamlessly use both on my laptop, tablet or phone.

I live in us and everyone uses sms, so that's what I use. What everyone else uses is moot. Michael Sørensen Nonsense. I'm not in the US (Europe) and the VAST majority in my country still use SMS. Alejandro And how do you send voice clips through SMS? Good luck with that runamonk Why the fuck are you sending voice clips? Just call them for fucks sake lol. Jesus you kids these days. IT'S A PHONE. Adrien Aubel At invi we observed that a significant amount of our users rely heavily on push to talk and voice typing. We want to improve it so that when you pick up the phone and put it on your ear it plays any unread message to make it more lightweight, as well as an auto-transcribe, but it's already pretty useful when you and your contact are used to it. When you're biking, on your way to the office, cooking, cute messages to your SO, ideas (that you can send to yourself as well), ... You can let your recipient get to your message whenever (s)he wants rather than requiring his/her availability right here and then. That being said, we'll bring soon WebRTC video calls / possible Duo integration to get face-to-face in one tap, and we expect this to indeed take over and reduce the microphone features usage. nigra truo Hahaha, you look silly defending a deficiency, voice memos are super useful, especially when driving or if somebodie's on a call. Used by many not stuck on sms. runamonk I'm not defending anything, sms is old and very long in the tooth. It should have been removed years ago. Andrew MMS handles voice clips just fine in my experience. dblock Easy, if your SMS app supports this (mine does), you can send voice clips as an attachment like any other MMS message. nigra truo Wow, the man is still using the archaic technology that is mms. Hahaha! I have not sent one like that since 2011, when i discovered whatsapp. Adrien Aubel I don't know if that's exactly what you meant, but on invi ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi ) you have push to talk, voice typing, and ability to share audio externally from any app (depending on the format and your carrier we may host it ourselves and send a link FYI). It's not just yet open outside of USA but I can eventually give you an APK if you can't wait to try it out, lmk! Tomáš Petrík Free for everyone, you say? Not here... And yes, I am in the EU. nigra truo Sms is over in europe, don't know where you are from, but you might want to be less backward and start using whatsapp like a billion other people, sms is archaic and it Can't do so many things that whatsapp can, which is already the defacto international IM standard, even on iphones, as it supports all the platforms. Michael Sørensen Scandinavia. And no one uses WhatsApp. Maybe backwards, but it works, and I still haven't seen a compelling argument for changing... Josh Brown outside america and use it everyday. Jason Hirsch I was very annoyed at having to add Hangouts as my SMS client. I couldn't keep separate separate anymore. Now in combination with Fi, GV, 2 phones and obi it's a nightmare. On this overseas trip i couldn't force Fi to dial via WiFi. So i had to go back and install Hangouts dialer. If they (Google) have a master plan there's no rhyme or reason to it. Nick I'm not sure what the future holds for us Fi users, but it's looking grim. My family and work is in the same boat it seems. I have been promoting Hangouts for a long time since it could handle everything I needed plus some, now as our services split out communications start to waver... All I can hope for now is they at least follow through with their promises to allo and add desktop support. (Status: Soon ™) atc-tech Google Voice users should still be able to use it too, I think? I don't know. I switched the the updated GV app when it came out around the same time the hangouts DEintegration was announced, so I'm not sure, but I think Voice users still can... Aaron Berlin Who knows what the plan is long-term for GVoice in Hangouts, but the actual GVoice app is actually good now. No equivalent to the chrome extension/desktop app, though. Ryne Hager You are right, Google Voice users can also continue to receive SMS messages in the app, I'll make that more clear. atc-tech Cool. I wasn't sure GV still could, but I thought I remembered hearing that we could. I gave up already though and use the prettier new GV app... Wish they would add back more features though. Ryne Hager The new app is so pretty. I do wish my GV voicemails would show up in my call logs again, though. atc-tech Yes! Along with the options for do not disturb mode. mxwp i exclusively use my GVoice number for calls and texts and use it on Hangouts. the update GVoice app has an annoying bug in that it tries to connect every account on your phone instead of just your main one. i have submitted it as a bug but have not heard anything back Tom Harman So when does Allo officially get SMS support, lol. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Same time it gets tablet support: Never. rndusrnm479461 Am I the only one who doesn't understand what's so good about SMS integration in either Allo or Hangouts? Is it really hard for you people to use 2 apps? Jesus christ. Google's "Android Messages" is lightweight anyway, why is it such a problem to use it? It shouldn't even eat much RAM. Kyle Gospodnetich Yes, yes you are. Please never work for Google, or really any company that has a hand in communications. My name is…. No, he is not Kyle Gospodnetich Congrats, now there's two of you idiots. iluvthesoftsoft One do-it-all app > two apps Adrien Aubel Let me know what you think about invi, https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi, we're trying to fix texting on Android and provide transparent switch between SMS&IM (devices handshake when you get into chats so that we determine whether you or the recipient has poor reception and should prefer SMS for example). MJ Two apps? One app for SMS and than Facebook, WhatsApp, Allo/Hangouts, and whatever to cover all my contacts. SMS is the only thing I can message 100% of my contacts with. Adrien Aubel Google's messaging strategy is now: - Android Messages for carriers & OEMs - meaning strictly SMS/RCS - Allo for their new consumer messaging service, and the focus of their upcoming work - Hangouts for business/enterprise They can't risk to upset carrier and OEMs by implementing non-carrier features in Android Messages / the default SMS app they provide. Or at least it's a risk they're not ready to take at that time. Btw I wouldn't say "Android Messages" is that lightweight btw, notably on modern devices it could be so much smoother :( sam1331 I don't get it either. When Android Messages came out I switched my SMS over to it. I quickly realized I was using it almost exclusively for 2 factor verification codes. But really, the notifications all go to the same place, I already have to decide whether to use Hangouts or Facebook Messenger when talking to basically anyone anyway. I also think people should push a little harder to move conversations over from SMS to something else, I've never found that to be very difficult. mxwp SMS is convenient because you know it will work with any American with a cell phone... including "dumb" flip phones. And it actually is really difficult to get people to switch to another service. Apple users just use imessage to send their SMS to me. And then I send them my glorious green bubbles and those ishills can suck it. YaKillaCJ Sms integration is important because it is supported by 100% of telecommunications service providers and integrated on all devices that can make a phone call and has a screen. You can even sms a home phone without a screen depending on carrier/service provider. Thus it messaging that works with 100% of your contacts. Having multiple Apps spread across 100s of contacts is plain annoying. So if any App wants to be taken serious, it needs to be serious and have sms. What's App already fills the void for bypassing sms across the globe. rndusrnm479461 This answer makes the most sense. Thanks. Adrien Aubel Let me know what you think about invi! play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi We're still new and young but we're very serious about our ambitions and not settling when we know it could/should be better. To fix texting on Android, we provide transparent switch between SMS&IM (devices handshake when you get into chats so that we determine whether you or the recipient has poor reception and should prefer SMS for example). Very handy in some countries/areas/events. And lets you reach *anybody* (that has a phone number). My name is…. Nobody uses SMS no more, and if i wanna send a text message to the last of the Mohicans, i will use my SMS app. I dont want no stupid integration and no stupid 'SMS fallback' that will make things worse. Chatting is not texting. YaKillaCJ There are only 2 widely used methods of messaging across mobile devices. Sms and What's App. Sms is supported on EVERY device from 2 way pagers and flip phones to house phones and smartphones. Any device that has a phone number supports sms. The majority of people doesn't care about added features like stickers and gif. We just care that all I need is the person phone number and from there I can call or text them. That's it. Bottom line is that it has to be a standard adopted by carriers on a worldwide scale. Hence what's app reason for such large scale use is it uses existing phone numbers for login, existing phone book for contact list, free, minimum data usage and encrypted. Even that is still not even used by a third of the devices that use sms. Ryuuie Last I checked, WhatsApp charged $1 or someshit. erptastic It has not done that officially for years. And even before that, they always just extended my account. Ryuuie Ah. Looks like it was recent and official as of last January but they dropped it. It was an annual $1 fee to use the app. disqus_Xz3y8OiO3O It's free YaKillaCJ Who actually pays that. I don't recall anyone ever paying. Besides, it's only $1 a year and that significantly cheaper than carriers who don't have unlimited sms charge. nigra truo The majority of people don't care about features? Go check the market share of whatsapp, you are misinformed. The majority does care and only hillbillies still use flip phones. ;-) YaKillaCJ Features are nice but seamless compatibility is more important. Btw last I recall, less than half of mobile phones in use are smartphones worldwide. Using What's App doesn't allow me to message 100% of my contacts, SMS does. Bottomline. nigra truo You can't send SMS internationally, the plans are very expensive. That is why Whatsapp got so incredible successful. Also, you have to remember that we are not talking about third world nations, which don't even have phones at all or have no good mobile networks, and in all others, Whatsapp has taken over and will be the new standard in the US too, once some people stop resisting it and try it out. I have a large group of people here in the USA with which I'm in contact daily, over Whatsapp and I'm doing communication that can't be done with SMS and would need another 5 apps to accomplish (which many people of course have not installed) nigra truo Sms has endless limitations that is making it useless compated to something as full featured as whatsapp, i found it easier to convince my backwards US friends to use whatsapp, as this will be the universal standard anyway, 1 billion users gives you a hint. YaKillaCJ I do agree that the standard needs to move forward. What I'm saying is that it would have to be a standard adopted by carriers & service providers worldwide. Until then, any App that wants to be taken serious and get use needs to fall back on the current standard. What's App billion users is small compared to the billions in use that support SMS. USA alone has 500million numbers that support sms and that just 1 country. nigra truo Nope, the US does not have 500 million SMS capable phones, that is wishful thinking, of 325 Million people, they would have to use two phones all the time, not to speak that 325 million you have to subtract babies and very old people that are not texting anyone. Whatsapp IS the standard, you can install it on any current phone, no matter who produced it, flip phones are the small minority now and since Whatsapp is free, unlike SMS (phone providers STILL charge you for it, either in a flat fee or individually), it makes it much more attractive to many. I have had the experience when I use SMS, people get offended when I send them a SMS just because they might be on a cheap plan and using a flip phone and each SMS costs them 30 cents and they ask me to please stop. This is not what you would call a barrier free system. Also, some plans have limits of how many you can send or receive and SMS is such a dumb and obsolete technology that it can only send 160 characters in one message and has to string several ones together. Sadly, no phone provider has invented anything useful in the last 20 years, SMS is ancient and the next technology that they tried to replace SMS with fell flat on its face. Companies in this respect know much more what customers want and can make it much more affordable or, in the case of Whatsapp, free. It was invented to avoid (international) ripoff by phone companies and be able to keep contact with your friends abroad without having to shell out 1 dollar per SMS. Sadly, the phone providers are the most technologically incompetent companies out there, it took a company like Apple to reinvent the smartphone, because the phone providers, which this is a core business are were too dumb to pull it off ;-) mxwp in the larger scheme of things, I agree with you that it is not a big deal. still, having one app do both was convenient. the other complaint is Android fanboys being envious of iMessage, which Hangouts could have become. exadeci The main reason that people use Imessage is that you get rich messaging capabilities out of the box if the person you are talking to has an Iphone everything is abstracted, you add someone's number and you start chatting right aways no need to exchange accounts id's or find which app you both use. And if the other doesn't have an Iphone you can still message them or if you killed your data plan it sends an sms. But Google doesn't add sms support because they are pushing for RCS which is a GOOD thing: Standalone Messaging 1-to-1 Chat Group Chat File Transfer Content Sharing Social Presence Information IP Voice call Best Effort Video call Geolocation Exchange Audio Messaging Network based blacklist Capability Exchange based on Presence or SIP OPTIONS All this WITHOUT using any data, data needs an link to be established this doesn't. Chris Hannan It's not hard for most of us to use it. The problem is the people we contact don't want to use separate apps. Everyone with iPhones uses iMessage because it just works by default. But barely anybody I know uses Hangouts and nobody I know uses Allo. If it was all built into one app that shipped with Android phones, more people would use it. Troy Leonard and I removed Hangouts as of today I will no longer consider using any google messaging service ever again Sruly J Isn't Gmail a form of messaging? (Or do you not use Gmail?) Troy Leonard Not for long I'm transitioning over to outlook.com. And upgrading my phone to an iPhone. I'm sick of slow to no updates on my phone,and done with Google ruining everything I ever liked about their apps and Android. naysayer Good riddance. Adrien Aubel Let me know what you think about invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi), a new app that we're making that brings a lot of the goodies iMessage brings to iOS users, with big long-term ambitions, and still trying to preserve a consistent and sleek UI. Hopefully that will make you stick to Android and you'll make your iPhone friends jealous in a few months/years ;) Zsolt V Why bother evangilizing? He already decided Outlook on an iPhone is better than Gmail, so let him enjoy it. Troy Leonard Your link is broken Adrien Aubel Fixed thanks! Disqus didn't like the closing ')' at the end of the link. XgudwilX eww outloook😲 Total Insecurity Saying "upgrading my phone to an iPhone" is the same as converting from atheism to any religion. Just a downgrade. bekifft It's true, and their failings and obvious ulterior motives in messaging have, for the first time in a decade, made me consider moving my email back to a private service over which I have control. Roy Thank you and have a nice flight. -Matoro Zeliph- Just want to make sure I'm not missing anything. So Google Voice SMS will no longer work too? Corbin Davenport That will still work as well. Ryne Hager Google voice will still work, just like Fi. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ It's primarily that regular SMS will no longer function in the app. A while back they killed of threading of SMS/MMS and Hangout messages, and now they are killing SMS/MMS entirely out of the app and suggestin people to switch to Android Messages. -Matoro Zeliph- Ok cool! I'm good then. Thanks for the clarification everyone Bill Blandford Hangouts SMS looks like it still works for Google Voice SMS too. Essentially, this is like Fi, which is a Google Voice number at heart. My wifi-only-device kids use Hangouts to call and text with a Google Voice #. Timmy Turner Yeah GV will continue to work through Hangouts since the number you use via Project-Fi is a GV given number. Adrien Aubel For people that were still using Hangouts and want to try a new app that also does SMS & IM, that tries to provide a fast & polished experience to fix texting on Android, I'd love some honest feedback! https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi We're trying hard to "make it right" and have so much planned on the roadmap, so any feedback is great to have to tweak things up. Let us know what you think! exadeci While the initiative is nice, why would we use your messaging app? If I want an instant message app that does sms and that no one else uses I already got Signal and at least Signal is proven to be secure. What makes Messenger (Facebook), WhatsApp and Imessage good? Their userbase. Ask anyone for a way to communicate and they will use one of those apps, no need for fallback sms when everyone has an account. Adrien Aubel Thanks for your feedback @exadeci:disqus! Great questions :) And Signal is nice as well! It's not for everybody but if you're happy with it keep using it but make sure to check us out in a few months to check that you haven't been missing out, we're going fast! I think there's much more to iMessage that makes it good than their userbase. It is a polished app that just works, and lets you reach anybody, therefore becoming your trusted "go to" texting app. We expect Google to release this summer new capabilities that will let you use IM in more scenarios. Very interesting stuff that we can't wait to let our users benefit from. But our initial target is actually SMS users, people that unlike you and I don't really care about the details, they just want a reliable app that sends and receive their messages. And they're actually quite happy with SMS/MMS in that regard, it just works (when you don't fight with APNs, something we try to prevent as well). We want to transparently "upgrade" those users that may be using Android Messages or a 3rd party app custom-made for the carrier or OEM, not necessarily developed with great care and polishment, and sometimes truly terrible (really, you wouldn't believe what's on some popular carriers, that most users end up using 10 times a day for years). Right now invi is mostly upgrading the transport of your messages and general experience as we develop another big focus of ours: bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages exchanged being plain text. Texting can be the most impersonal way of communication and this flattens relationships. A bar suggests as you type relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps you transmit how you truly felt when writing this message, it doesn't flatten as much your emotions (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). It always send instantly over IM as well (no upload or anything like that, optimized WebP images for super-fast download). Open your top 3 chats on Signal, chats that you have with people you care the most about, look at all this flat plain texting, and try to visualize the gap compared to what it could be, how it could have been more personal and transmitting more of your feelings or emotions. We're targeting this gap, and again, we're just getting started but have serious ambitions and motivation. If you use Snapchat, look at all that rich media that gets thrown to your eyes or that you throw to people, that doesn't always make sense and is often disconnected from conversations, sometimes losing its value and feeling like you just threw a bottle in the ocean, just leaving you with a list of who saw it. We're looking at that gap as well, as invi becomes more and more rich in terms of content creation. After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. We are in talks with some OEMs and resellers to make invi default which would help grow invi's user base and help us improve our product with more diverse usage, while some upcoming features of invi should ultimately help us get a lot more users naturally. exadeci Signal has actually Gifs from Giphy, stickers and the possibility to send a location but I don't use this kind of feature even on Messenger it's quite rare that I send a sticker. Google is strongly pushing for RCS adoption which would add all these emotions sharing: https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Rogers_Google_RCS.gif https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Telenor_6P_GIF_0UHHQdI.gif https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/RCS_Android_Update.width-600.png Adrien Aubel Exactly, but how relevant is Giphy? Again don't compare with things you've seen so far but with what it could potentially be if it truly understood your relationships and intentions, if it combined that with your taste and the way you usually communicate with this specific person. And what if your friends or other people were able to add their own media and stickers through channels and then be discovered, liked and followed, with deep intelligence powering it all and bringing the right content to the right user? We built invi to support all this, we don't just use a Giphy API, we used the most advanced and lightweight technologies to communicate in realtime with our backend, even on pretty bad 3G, from where we curate the media that eventually gets recommended to you. The screenshots you attached look great as well, but see Android Messages is a good example there's only 5 packs of stickers that won't get more relevant or smarter no matter how many stickers you use or how many times you use Android Messages. Idk who would use a given sticker hundreds of times, but anyway I'm not sure those were really representative of how Android Messages is most commonly used. The features are technically there, as often, but they're very limited in their potential as of now. The Awesome Bar isn't for everyone but can eventually help people like you, as images just get displayed while you're typing, no action required, and if you see one that you like you can just tap it to see how it looks and enrich your message, send and you're done. Google is pushing RCS, very true! And we're excited about the great work the Jibe team did in the past couple years. They're a bit shy to share their RCS client implementation at the moment, it may be unstable or not well documented at the moment, but we're meeting regularly with Google and hope to add RCS to our transparent switch as soon as possible, even though the user base is a bit limited at the moment it has the potential to grow fast and solve many issues. If they're reluctant for too long we may use other hubs that would communicate seamlessly through Unified Profile. But for now, we're watching the number of users actually benefiting from RCS grow while we focus on other areas of improvements. sam1331 I am actually kind of optimistic about all this, more so than I was maybe a year ago. They've been putting out a steady stream or improvements to Allo, and when I've experimented with it with a friend it actually is an enjoyable experience. Releasing it without a web app is just shocking, but if that's added and it works well, I could totally see moving over to it from Hangouts, where I do the vast majority of my communicating. The other piece of the puzzle is Duo. If they can integrate a Duo button in Allo conversations (like it seems they will), and they eventually add group calling, which can't be that far off, then I think it will be a nice solution for myself and my family. And I've got quite a few friends that are all about Android instead of iOS, so I can see them switching to Allo from Hangouts. But not until there is a web app, because they aren't stupid. Chad Knasinski I would use Allo if they added SMS support and a desktop version like Hangouts had. Nick.Trite Same here. I have Fi so I'll continue to use Hangouts for SMS. I really love the fact that I can switch seamlessly from desktop to mobile and still be sending SMS. Until Allo does that, I won't consider moving. Chad Knasinski Ditto Sir_Brizz And multi-device support. Can't even use it or sync it on my LTE Tablet... Carson Saldanha So, basically Hangouts but revamped? We've come in full-circle. Sir_Brizz Sure. The problem is that every other chat platform has these features in 2016. Including Hangouts. Roy Me to, love it. mxwp unless they remove hangouts from gmail, people will still secretly be using "hangouts" all the time. in fact, the only way Allo will ever take off without SMS is if it replaces Hangouts (gtalk) on gmail and inbox. Chad Knasinski So correct me if I am wrong here but Google wants us to do this with our messages: SMS - Google Messenger Business SMS - Hangouts Messages - Allo Facebook - Messenger Video Chat - Duo Business Video Chat - Hangouts Video Really? Are you kidding me here? Timmy Turner You've got it right and if there's a joke, you'll being waiting a while for the punchline. disqus_em5YfkbWdk What Business SMS and how is 8t different from other SMS? Zsolt V What does Facebook have to do with anything you wrote? So you are corrected. SpadeX Are you new to tech world? John Not exactly. SMS - Messenger SMS (Project Fi and Voice) - Hangouts SMS (Voice) - Voice Chat - Allo Chat - Hangouts Video chat - Duo Video chat - Hangouts Voice call - Hangouts Voice call (Voice) - Voice Nicholas Conrad Email - Gmail Business Email - G Suite SMS - Google Messenger Business SMS - Hangouts Messages - Allo Facebook - Google+ Video Chat - Duo Business Video Chat - Hangouts Meet Phone calls - Google Voice/Project Fi/Google Home FIFY xyz That's only for Google fanboys. Regular people ditched Google's messaging apps a long time ago. Timmy Turner I recommend Textra to anyone looking for a new SMS app. Sleek, customizable and continually updated/supported. Adrien Aubel Textra is very nice, notably customization-wise as you said, you can go deep and fine-tune basically any UX element. And it's super fast and lightweight as well. I am working as well on a new SMS app that also provides IM similarly to iMessage on iPhone, and many other features, most of them upcoming though. Would you mind giving me a honest feedback when you have the time? It's called invi on the Play Store https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi Timmy Turner Sure thing. freshprince_87 That invi SMS app is an awesome app. Near flawless app. but I stop using it because I kept having problems with MMS messages and also it just like Allo in the sense where if you uninstall the app and reinstall it on the same phone all your instant messages are all gone including some of the regular SMS /MMS messages. You need to make the app save all your messages on to an account like a Google account in the cloud. So that no matter what device you use the instant messages will still be there. Adrien Aubel @freshprince_87:disqus Thank you for your feedback! MMS can be very tricky and every carrier has its own set of specificities, I'm sorry about that, it shows we're still young but obviously like you said, such a core functionality bug makes our whole effort worthless for you here. Do you mind sharing your carrier, device model, and Android version? Did you try using "Legacy MMS" in the app settings? About the IM sync, that's an issue we're definitely looking into, considering all potential security and privacy issues, notably as some countries like USA recycle pretty aggressively your phone numbers, and with the desire to bring a Web client in mind. Google should announce this summer APIs that will eventually help us regarding security, so stay tuned :) freshprince_87 Thanks. I didn't use the legacy MMS. I hope that you add the IM sync soon. I'm on a T-Mobile service using the Moto Z Play on Android Nougat 7.0 Adrien Aubel Ok thank you, if you don't mind I have other questions to dive into your problem :) What specifically was failing? MMS sending, receiving, or both? Did it show an error? Is it only on group MMS or all MMS? Whatever information you may have will be helpful. Our next release should bring MMS reliability improvements and notably Wifi texting when supported by the carrier (first MMS may send up to 60s to send as we're trying out routes but then all other Wifi MMS should send very fast). Tom Westrick https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5ecvBaqHBk MJ Thank God I use Project Fi otherwise this would suck big time for me. TJ Mills Thank God I have Google voice.... Def Ref Actually, it sucks for Fi users who wish to economize on data because Hangouts no longer uses cellular SMS but requires a data connection, wifi or cell data. I didn't realize this was happening (because they said Fi wasn't going to be affected) until I got my replacement Nexus 6P and suddenly wasn't receiving SMS texts. They couldn't sort it out, even sending me a new SIM which didn't work either. It wasn't until I really started digging that I discovered that SMS required data to work and you'd either have to use a different SMS app (and lose multi-device sync; esp ability to type on computer thru Gmail) or turn on data. Lame. MJ OK... I am on WiFi most of the day myself but even with no WiFi it's still texting. Confused, you don't have data on Project Fi? Def Ref I keep my mobile data turned off unless I need traffic info for navigation or need to be in contact with someone via FB Messenger. Otherwise between home, work, Xfinity hotspots, etc., I'm usually not far from wifi. I don't care if I can't get my email for a half-hour while I'm driving. When you're paying per MB, you start noticing how much data apps guzzle. But last month I only used 85MB, so my next bill will be just over $24 with tax. Point is that before they killed SMS support, I didn't need to have data turned on to receive texts. Now I do. MJ I just don't see how you would guzzle data if usually on WiFi. I leave data on and use less than a GB a month. Granted, I don't check my email on my phone ever. LOL Dracono Love hangouts never used SMS. It also seems most negative reviews about it being slow was always tired to the SMS feature. I'm now curious with the removal of they'll us the opportunity to evolve or let it idle. mxwp it will evolve into a business app... but hopefully still available for consumers VAVAMk_2 Just give us SMS support in Allo for Christ's sake! Adrien Aubel SMS/MMS can be quite hard to deal with technically and Google didn't choose to go that way. It is possibly also due to the push they did to replace the default SMS app on many OEMs and carriers, strategically it's hard for them to push much of Google's agenda through the SMS app they give carriers, and they're mostly limited to SMS/RCS. Roy Christ will not give you SMS, bat Star of David could promise you RCS in Allo. mxwp Big G repeatedly stated it would never happen tim242 Liar. Adrien Aubel https://twitter.com/amitfulay/status/840236304130428928 Roy Great. It's was the plan all along. Now Allow will get RCS and web browser everything gonna integrate with Duo. I'm all the way in. I never like Hangout. I love Allo. #stop stop babies don't you cry. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I don't think that's possible. RCS is still mainly just an extension of SMS. If it doesn't support SMS, I don't see it handling RCS. Roy When RCS will come it will be with SMS already. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Based on what? Besnik Rrustemi No problem guys,we have like 69 other Messaging Apps by Google to choose from and maybe 2 new others coming soon. Roy Haha it's so old. Can someone can come with new jokes here? Besnik Rrustemi Well sorry Old Man then, never knew your age before. * Respect for Old People * Sir_Brizz Let the confusion officially begin! Indianajonze google can go fk themselves Robert Gerhart Why isn't anybody asking the bigger question: why the hell does anyone use outdated SMS in the first place? It's like complaining that Hangouts doesn't integrate butter churns and wagon wheels either. There is nothing more annoying than a text message. Adrien Aubel SMS is always nice to have in some situations, that happen more or less depending on where you live. Uncovered areas, concerts or big games, people having no LTE-enabled plans, or simply on some roads and highways. In USA for example all those scenarios happen a lot, notably in some states. And eventually, in most countries you still use SMS for 3rd party services, banks, transportation, or even government-related messages. Most importantly, in countries that still use SMS you can reach *anybody you know* from one app. And that's really a great thing to have. Now you're right, IM is so much more pleasant. Instant delivery, read status, last active time, way faster image format and transport. At invi ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi ) we try to take advantage of this and combine both the way it should be. When you open a chat with somebody, we trigger a handshake to check that both you and the recipient are well connected. If one of both doesn't answer on time, it simply switches to SMS/MMS, it's automatic and out of your way. Otherwise you take advantage of state-of-the-art transport with some unique optimizations. Try to send a GIF over IM and see how fast it goes, compared to MMS or even Whatsapp. Let me know what you think! Aaron Simple; SMS is ubiquitous. Every cellular device in operation can send and receive SMS, from the most current and expensive flagships like the iPhone and Galaxy, to the cheapest budget devices, all the way down to the oldest flip phones. I can text my dad on his flip, my wife on her Nexus or my Capt on his iPhone and each one will receive that message and reply. Show me an IM that can do all of that (that isn't on the iPhone). I guess that invi app that guy's been pedaling might, but I'm waiting for it to gain some traction before trying to convince anybody to switch to yet another IM. Rod The rest of the world uses Whatsapp, everyone has it installed. JG Even people with generic flip phones? Rod Nope, but I don't remember the last time I saw someone with a flip phone. The poor now bear Galaxy Win/Pocket/etc JG My aunt still has one. She recently attempted to upgrade to a smartphone but that seems to have failed big time... Apparently my telling her to tap the icon that's labeled "EMAIL" to get her email is too complicated... That and the free phone she got is a PoS... 512MB of RAM and only 4GB of storage - with the OS consuming all but like 100MB there of. So it didn't perform quite so hot. She seemed a bit surprised her free phone didn't perform as well as my Pixel XL does... Rod You're better off simply calling her. Lol JG Or even better off not getting in touch with her period. I also happened to see another flip phone in use while I was out traveling today. TJ Mills Everyone in China uses Wi chat. Rod I believe you meant WeChat. Yes, but WhatsApp still has the largest userbase. TJ Mills Yes, I did mean WeChat. I knew it looked wrong. My point is that not everyone is on WhatsApp in all places in the world. Where SMS is ubiquitous. Rod I have a friend that came from China, and he says most people in China uses WhatsApp as well. It's pretty omnipresent. Aaron And if everyone in the US would get on board with a single IM that would be great. But here iPhone users tend to stick with the stock Messages app. Great for sending iMessages between each other and SMS to the rest of us. Terrible for convincing them to switch to another IM. And most Android users I know use whatever stock SMS message app came with their phone for texting with iPhone users and old people and FB Messenger for IM with everyone in their friends list. So if you have a strategy for getting everyone on a single IM platform I'm sure the Allo team at Google would love to hear it. Jordan L I agree with your post. iphone users LOVE their stock messaging app, as they should it's the best app on their phone. It feels like, at least in my circle, iphone users have the stock messaging app, Facebook Messenger, and Whatsapp. "older" people only have the stock app as they can barely use their phones in the first place. "younger" people all three. Rod Yeah, I know how it works in USA. As a foreigner, it's funny to see how much you guys rely on SMS lol. Aaron Not funny haha but funny sad. :( Rod USA is a world apart. lomsha Believe it or not, even 2g is still a luxury in some countries, which makes​ instant messaging iffy. In those cases sms is a great alternative. Not everyone is in the 1st world with a sweet smartphone and reliable data access. TJ Mills Standard is better than better. When someone comes up with a universal replacement that works on all classes of phones, then the world can switch. Until then it's a mishmash of services and applications​to communicate. Why does everyone still use email? Because of the standards. Michael Sørensen Convince me why I shouldn't... Currently I can write to anyone for free without first asking them what their preferred platform is. And they can reply for free regardless of said preferred platform. Again, convince me why that's not good enough? And don't say "stickers". Just don't. Security? Bah, no sensitive information sent. Robert Gerhart Two words: phone call. Just freaking CALL them... You already have the phone in your hand, and you know they have one as well. If you can condense what you need to say into 144 characters, it probably isn't important enough to bother the other person with in the first place. No more retarded tap-tap-tap... Turb0wned That was a stupid answer. I'm not going to have 15 different messaging apps to be able to talk to people. iMessage just works with everyone. Adrien Aubel Agreed that there's something pretty great about being able to reach *all your friends* from a single app. At least the ones that have a freaking phone numbers :D Of course, it's just how messaging should be but it also makes sense that all big players would heavily restrict any 3rd party integration, messaging is a huge, strategical, market. nigra truo Very good point, sms is over and has been for a long time, it is just that americans are strangely still in love with the ancient spartanic standard, they are backwards compared to the rest of the globe. Whatsapp for example does not support sms because it REPLACES it obviously. Sms can't do rich communication without ugly crutches, try making a free voice or video call through it, send a full size video, high resolution photos, a contact, a document, your location, an audiorecording and everything encrypted. All these things whatsapp can do natively, on all platforms, not just on iphones or apple devices, 1 billion users speak a clear language. Midnitte At this point, I'm held hostage stuck using Hangouts since it's the only thing that natively supports desktop messaging. Sigh. Bryan Chandler Signal has a Chrome app for desktop messaging. https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/signal-private-messenger/bikioccmkafdpakkkcpdbppfkghcmihk?hl=en Midnitte Ah yea, I would prefer something native though, plus I still use Hangouts for some contacts. I lament the loss of merged conversations too Lord Argyris "Each has its disadvantages, though. The latter doesn't have quite the same feature set that Hangouts did, and the former is a Facebook product." It's lines like these that keep.me coming back to AP. JD My support for Google and their messaging platforms ended the beginning of May. Kelly Clubb Well this sucks for any user that enjoyed an easy to use sms app. I use Hangouts and thankfully for project fi will continue it's support BossMa1n3 Eh..doesn't effect me stop using hangout for sms awhile ago..more interested in a flat screen phone with side bezels as thin as the one in the pic.. Grey PLEASE Bring Hangouts Chat and Hangouts Meet to all users. That has so many new and awesome features. It's like everything Allo isn't. DragoCubed The comment section is rough b_boogey_xl Bye Hangouts! hp-fourtwenty oh ffs...voice is still supported??? hell yeah!! nxtiak I'm waiting for the day G+ contacts disappear from Hangouts. I hate how on PC when I type a name to start a conversation it lists random people on G+. SHOW ME THE NAMES FROM MY DAMN CONTACTS GOOGLE!!!!!!!!! Maave RIP Hangouts. I had group chats, Google Voice, and SMS all in one. Now my group chats have moved to Telegram but I'm still stuck with nerfed Hangouts for GV. Chris Wachtman Hey, what's wrong with facebook? /s Gordon Spurgeon Spooner I switched to Signal because of this mess and I've very happy I did---it works great. The only feature I miss is tablet support, but it's coming soon, and unlike Google, when Signal receives a new feature, it's actually ready to be released, and works well. Jason E Perkins Boy am I glad for the second half of that title. ROB TEXTRA DC_Guy If Apple would just open up iMessage to Android, 99% of our messaging problems would be over. haha Dragos Lucian Totally forgot Hangouts existed. I've been using Telegram for quite some time now and I'm more than happy with it. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ The name of the app is very off-putting if they ever wanted to increase adoption among business/serious users. But as I found out just yesterday, it's actually a really nice SMS apparatus. rap Some say SMS is dead. But not everyone has a smartphone or data. SMS works without either. nigra truo Well, if you have a minimalist phone and plan, you will likely be forced to pay for SMS by the same token. Data is the future, smartphones also, it is just a matter till SMS is gone for good everywhere. The most mentioned point is the point that you have to pay for SMS one way or another, it is never free. Adam Margeson Haven't been using it since I switched over to Allo. 1966CAH When it comes to messaging, Google is like an ex-girlfriend. Once, so sweet and alluring, now somebody I want nothing to do with. johdaxx Well, I hope they can sort this mess out eventually. I don't really care too much about SMS per se...but I do need some way to message people that don't have whatever apps I have or have apps I don't have. Especially if they have the audacity to use an iPhone or something. Brandon Hann This didn't affect me since I use Google Voice exclusively and have a data-only plan for my cell service. Let's just hope Google doesn't kill off Google Voice in the future. keithzg I would say, why remove a feature when you're clearly still supporting it for some users anyways, so it's no more maintenance to just leave it enabled for everyone? I would say that, if I thought there was any coherent or rational approach to messaging strategy and development at Google. Personally I switched to Facebook Messenger for SMS, if only because of Chat Heads (multitasking for IM is pretty nice). Was tempted towards Signal, but Signal wants you to import and encrypt your SMS's, and I don't want to get locked into an SMS app. derp_cookies These guys are starting to remind me more and more of Hooli. xyz Good decision. Next step is to discontinue Hangouts, then Allo, then Messages, and then Duo.

Resold Pixel phones originally purchased from Project Fi are having their IMEIs blacklisted Richard Gao Follow View All Posts 2017/05/25 5:30am PDTMay 25, 2017 59 Plus 1 on G+ 150 Share on Facebook 58 Share on Twitter Total Shares267 Google News Pixel Pixel XL Project Fi Back in November, when the Pixel was slowly beginning to ship to customers, there were numerous reports of people getting their Google accounts banned for purchasing Pixel and Pixel XL devices with the intent to resell them. It turns out that this issue hasn't exactly been laid to rest, as it seems that Pixel phones purchased from Project Fi for this purpose are now getting blacklisted via their IMEI numbers. As an overview, people originally bought Pixels from both the Google Store and Project Fi to sell them to a New Hampshire-based reseller. Why New Hampshire, you may ask? There's no sales tax. Both parties here were supposed to make a profit, but Google ended up banning a ton of accounts for a violation of their terms of service.. Considering how important Google is in our lives (Gmail, Google Photos, YouTube, Play Store, etc.), a lot of people were obviously not happy. In the end, Google did restore many of these accounts, but it was obviously enough for a good scare. However, it seems that Google still hasn't completely forgiven people for violating their ToS. Kyle Bennett, the editor-in-chief and founder of the HardOCP website, had his Pixel XL's IMEI blacklisted just yesterday. IMEIs are typically blacklisted by carriers when phones are lost or stolen, but that's clearly not what happened here. Calling T-Mobile didn't do anything, as their staff told him that they could not reverse the blacklisting. His communication with Swappa support was more interesting, though; here's what they told him: "Sorry to hear of the complaints. We have seen a great number of Pixel devices becoming blacklisted the past two days. We are still trying to figure out why this has happened to so many devices. We are working to find out the cause of this widespread issue. It would be best for both of you to keep on top of Google and pressing them for an explanation. In one other case, I saw this morning Google agreed to send the buyer a replacement device so that might be an option to look into. Seller please work with the buyer and Google to see if they can get to the bottom of it." Kyle then contacted Google support, with the first representative claiming that he had simply received a spam message. When he showed a second rep how his IMEI had indeed been blacklisted via Swappa's ESN/IMEI checker (useful tool if you're buying a phone, by the way), he was told that his Pixel XL hadn't been reported as stolen, but that it had been originally purchased through Project Fi. Kyle was also once again told that his phone hadn't really been blacklisted, but a quick rescan of his IMEI in Swappa proved otherwise. His case was escalated to Project Fi's support team, but the customer service rep refused to give him a reference number and told him that he'd receive it via email. After contacting a third representative, Kyle was informed that his phone had indeed been blacklisted, but that Google wasn't responsible for doing so. This lends further credence to the Project Fi explanation, as it's the carrier and not the manufacturer that has the ability to blacklist devices. The situation is still ongoing, but that's all we know for now; we'll update with more information as we get it.

Okay. NeverrKnowsBest You can sell a Project Fi phone. You just buy them in bulk and try to make a profit off Project Fi. Stupid that the customer is being punished for this, though. Green Dog Is it clear that this is one of the phones that was bought in bulk from that retailer? From my reading, it was just a resold phone. I mean obviously, it's not happening to all phones, but the fact that it's still happening is a concern. NeverrKnowsBest The IMEIs are being linked to one particular reseller in New Hampshire. celestre Do you have more information than is present in the article on this? NeverrKnowsBest I'm just going off what the article said. I would love to read more, but I highly doubt they are just flipping the switch on every resold Project Fi phone. That just isn't very plausible, at least to my knowledge. datkidpatrick you misunderstood the article... they referenced a time where a bulk reseller's phones were black listed... but now it is happening to a bunch of random sellers that decided to sell the phone... Richard Gao The bulk reseller's phones weren't blacklisted at that time. It is entirely possible that these are the same phones. datkidpatrick i purchased mine straight from project fi... sold it 3 months ago and the seller told me the other day it was blacklisted... and yes my mistake.. the bulk resellers email's were blocked or something like that... Cael Did you pay off the phone before you sold it? datkidpatrick yes i did... Corey Kinard So they're punishing someone that fully paid for a device from you, who fully owned the device? They're legally allowed to just fully break something they've already sold and have no right to? This is worse than when carriers wouldn't unlock phones... datkidpatrick im still giving google the benefit of doubt that it was a mistake... they just need to fix it PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ You'll easily win in small claims court if you have to refund and take the phone back. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ What kind of financing plan did you have? They were first sold in Oct. 22 2016 and this is only May 2017. I seem to remember 24 month financing or 12 month financing. You paid your phone off three months ago and already had sold it on Swappa for some time? datkidpatrick ya youre allowed to pay it off early... PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Maybe that's what caused the error at Fi in blacklisting by accident. datkidpatrick ya that doesn't make any sense... but it got fixed this morning by google... NeverrKnowsBest I see that now. Thanks for the clarification. In any case, there has to be something in common with these blacklisted phones, I don't think Google/Project Fi would blacklist all second hand phones, I don't think that's very plausible. Corey Kinard Do you really need to think straight when you are in competition for largest company in the world? They probably got algorithms looking for shit and those algorithms mess up. 4Ui812 That's pretty shitty Google. David Bowline Is it really? What's shitty is the people buying in bulk just to make an easy buck and therefore screwing people over. Swappa needs to go after these people. jonzey231 Yeah but if I bought a Pixel LAST YEAR and wanted to sell it no in preparation for the next Pixel or the OP5, for example, my customer may get screwed even though it was just an innocent buy and resell. Max Uh? That's not what happened here... so far this situation seems to be the result of a reseller elaborate plan to evade tax and sell the scarce phone for a bigger profit. This wasn't an individual reselling his/her own phone. jonzey231 Uh? I know that it was originally caused by the douche bags in NJ, but now it's affecting regular people. David Bowline No they won't. I'll bet you can call Google and set it up at the time. Use your noggin and quit jumping to conclusions before the fact. jonzey231 But you saying that is also jumping to conclusions, just on the other side of the argument. If you want to argue me, call Google and play it out. Report your findings here. Otherwise, your words mean no more or less than mine. 4Ui812 That's called capitalism. No one is forcing you to buy it. What Google needs to do is fix all the reported issues with that shitty phone. As for the limited supply of said phone , again that's Google's fault (hell , I wouldn't be surprised if Google intentionally limted the supply ... That's a play out of nintys handbook) Duder12 I have a pixel. There is nothing wrong with my phone. I love it. SirCanealot But I have a Pixel and it is broken. Surely this is not possible to exist in reality? :O :O :O David Bowline If Google is selling phones to a specific customer, who then turns around and sells them en masse, how is Google to know what was sold legally and what was stolen? Google has every right to blacklist those phones. Nobody forced anyone to buy a phone from some jerk on swappa. Its the responsibility of the middle man seller to take care of the problem, not Google. This isn't rocket science here. 4Ui812 You're right , it's not rocket science. If the phone is reported as stolen then it's ok to black list the IMEI. This story makes no mention of phones being stolen. Therefore like I said.... That's pretty shitty Google. A Person It may suck, but who is to decide how my money is spent? kbbl Caveat emptor. SeanPR11 Or.... don't buy your phone from a New Jersey Douchebag. If people don't buy from them, they will stop doing this bullshit. It sucks that regular people are caught in the middle (which happens all too often). It seems Swappa should have known these phones were out there (given the business they are in) and flagged them with the IMEI checker. Alex Excuse them for doing whatever they like with a product they purchased. Pfff David Bowline Then Google can assume that they were stolen and blacklist them. It's not Googles fault here. JFC. SeanPR11 Amen. Ryan from GroupTweet Yes, its shitty. If anything Google should go after the reseller, not the innocent legitimate customers that bought the devices and who are now punished because their phones are blacklisted. Alexander Z Great Swappa can't GO after anyone. Maybe suspend/revoke their account but that's it. My trusted seller hasn't been any help at all with the blacklisted pixel I bought. It's so messed up!! T4rd Saw the site/forum owner of a site I frequent get hit with this on his Pixel this week too. Crazy how the Pixel is being plagued with all sorts of extraneous issues. They can't stay in stock, forcing people to buy second hand, then they get black listed because of some weird policy Google has with Project Fi phones. Max Well being out of stock has nothing strange coming from a Google phone, that's been their main issue for a few years now (Nexus), and it happens even to Apple on launch but the difference is that they're a lot better ramping up production afterwards. This blacklisting is really weird, but so far it seems to be potentially related to a shady reseller so we'll have to wait and see if we get more clarification soon. Geoff Johnson As someone from New Hampshire, it's weird to see my state in an AP article, since nothing interesting ever happens here lol. This sucks though because buyers who bought their Pixel 2nd hand months ago now suddenly might get it blacklisted? J.J. Holy f. That is terrible. So random guy buys a second hand pixel (because Google was out of stock) later gets blacklisted by Google/fi. Gets no help from Google. Never buys a Google phone again. Real smart. Green Dog This on top of the seeming shaky quality of the phones may force me to an iPhone. J.J. I feel ya there but, i just can't do the iPhone thing. Loving this s8+ right now. Duder12 When consumers say this its just sad. Why when you have a difficult time with one android manufacturer immediately think its all Androids and switch to the iPhone? This is how Apple gets tons of customers. Everyone that had a bad time with Samsung just assumed their only other option was iPhone bc MARKETING. Green Dog Because I don't want to have to deal with OS updates through the carrier or a limited phone in terms of LTE bands, as is common for Android phones? People like other phones and I've played with some of them, but I like the Pixel/Nexus lines. But this does give me pause. blenderboy Well, the only offering that competes with iPhone in the world of android is the pixel phone. Samsung displays(hardware in general) are great but software experience can't be compared with iPhone or pixel. It is just sad that they can't keep up with Apple or Google. Google is trying really hard to reach there. I am still using Android because of the platforms openness. Duder12 Fair enough but you know what I mean. You are an exception but A LOT of consumers act this way. Honestly I bought my Pixel through the Google Store last fall and its been solid. I love it. Google needs to sort out the second hand market but these are growing pains. Hardware is still new to them bc the nexus line had help from the OEMs. Now they dont. marcusmarcus2 His comment does not address all Androids. He is only speaking of this one phone. It could be he was between using phones by Google and iPhones and he choose to go with Google's phone. Now with this situation, he decided to go to his second choice. I'm not defending switching to an iPhone over another manufacturer, just pointing out his statement you criticized did not say what you thought it was saying and you were the one to actually apply his statement to all Androids. Just playing the devil's advocate here Alex Because when you pay 7-8-900€ (the price of an iPhone) on an Android phone you expect it to be flawless. And that's normal! However, in real life, regardless if you pay 300 or 800€, Android remains Android, with its notoriously inconsistent battery life, inexplicable wakelocks, unfixed bugs (don't get me stored on the "low priority" bugs with thousands of stars), 2 year updates, etc, etc. tekfr33kn That seems a little dramatic considering that iPhones are far from flawless. You also pay that amount for your average laptop and they aren't flawless. It seems you, or someone else, is holding Android phones to an unrealistic standard. Alex Please don't compare a laptop with an Android phone. It makes absolutely no sense. Isn't it rather that manufacturers (Google being the first of them) increase the prices each year to hallucinating levels with little to no innovation or improvement in user experience. Take the S8 line. Beautiful phones, remarkable design, but a fraction of the cost you pay goes to that crap Bixby that nobody wants tekfr33kn I'll agree with you that Google is artificially raising the price far beyond what it should be but that's basic capitalism and market forces. If the market doesn't want those kinds of prices or can't support it, it won't sell. The issue is that people are actually willing to pay that. iPhones are the primary example. There's about $400 - $500 worth of stuff put in a phone that goes for $800 - $1000 and they still sell like hotcakes. I also agree with you about the S8's and Bixby but again, the market says that the S8 is a hot seller and so Samsung isn't about to change that trend. That kind of makes your argument moot. As for comparing a smartphone to a laptop - if you can't see the comparisons, it's either willful ignorance or you just don't know a thing about electronic devices (specifically smartphones or laptops). In either case, I can't help you with that. The fact is that they share more in common that differences. It's one of the many reasons that development strategies (hardware and software) often translate quite well between them. xyz Uhm, because the phone in question is the overpriced Google phone that is intended to compete with the iPhone and which Google fanboys insist is the greatest Android phone of all time. psychic99 It costs about the same to make a Pixel XL as it does an iphone 7, so why would you expect Google to make less margin than Apple? I will say their ecosystem and support SUCKs compared to Apple, so yeah it should be hundred less because the lifecycle experience of a Pixel will be much worse than Apple and the fact that they artificially end support after 2 years is atrocious. I have 4+ year old Nexus that operate just fine on custom ROMs. And BTW I don't think it is worth it either and happily keep my Nexus 6p for less than 50% the cost. I can't rationalize the price they are asking. Google's support is not consistent. Either they will go over the top to help, or tell you go away you are screwed, There is nothing in the middle, and until you engage them you have no idea if you are going to get help or the hand. Yet another reason they should be hundreds less. Merrill Sampson Just FYI, Google announced at IO a few days ago that they're extending the support cycle on the Pixel from 2 year to 5. marcusmarcus2 Do you have a source for that? https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/4457705?hl=en#nexus_devices Android Version updates: October 2018 Security updates: October 2019 Duder12 Dont forget that apple blocked iPhones that had their fingerprint sensor replaced. Also, dont forget Apple is trying to get a bill banned that will allow consumers to have 3rd parties fix phones. PS: My Pixel is fucking awesome. NexusKoolaid "Dont forget that apple blocked iPhones that had their fingerprint sensor replaced." And this in and of itself was a good thing. With the sensor and the CPU being paired, the sudden appearance of a new sensor having a new signature was deemed to be a security breach. I'm not standing up for Apple here, just calling a spade a spade. And I don't know what information Apple could have shared with 3rd party repair houses (if they were inclined to play nice with them) without compromising security. "PS: My Pixel is fucking awesome." I wish I had one. But they were so hard to get hold of for so long that at this point I'll hang on to my 6P until the Pixel2 is out. psychic99 On Android if you reinstall the O/S or make major modifications they simply invalidate the fingerprint then you have to enter the password manually as a failback. Then you can enrol your fingerprint again. In fact every few days you have to manually enter your pin on N to get into the phone. Sounds like a reasonable method, rather than locking the phone forever. Apple went one step farther. You should go watch youtube... Apple is on a mission to make 3rd party repair a thing of the past. They even specifically make it hard to repair. They want control of the supply chain and dispose of equipment as fast as possible. NexusKoolaid On your first point, there is little control over hardware used to support the platform, so core design decisions are prone to fall back to a software solution. Apple on the other hand has tight control of their hardware and have the option for hardware based solutions, whatever the motivation might be, such as better security or to maintain control of their platform (probably a mix on the two). On your second point, I've read the headlines and seen videos on Youtube (like Louis Rossman). Yeah - their crusade against 3rd party repair sickens me to no small degree. Not just because it would prevent me from seeking out more economical and timely repair of my phone (if I had an iPhone), but because this type of precedent could trickle down to other things I might want to tinker with. Jay Hate to say it but that is the risk people run when you don't buy your devices brand new. J.J. True. But they exasperate said risk artificially for the perceived end goal.... More Profit. The truth is they are doing the exact opposite. This news definitely makes me pause on buying a pixel at all. The Second hand market is real and if i have a bad experience do to Google on a second hand device i will probably not buy new from them when i have the funds. james fuston If you (or the person who sells you a phone) violates the terms of service, you're gonna have a bad time regardless of manufacturer. blenderboy Real question to ask, did Apple ever had similar issue with many devices? hunter2 Probably not since Apple realizes that the perceived strong resale value is a determining factor for many people. Even people who may have never sold a product second hand gain some comfort from the knowledge that they could potentially recoup a lot of their costs if they ever needed to sell. ericshmerick Do the TOS say you can never ever resell the device? Serious question. ekana_stone No the TOS is that you resell as soon as you bought it, so like if you bought from fi cuz it's cheaper and the resold it a little under asking. It's only those phones that were black listed ericshmerick What defines "as soon as?" 5 minutes after purchase? 1 week? 2.8 months? 3 years? marcusmarcus2 Do we have confirmation that it is only those phones that were black listed? Could they have inadvertently black listed other phones from fi? EarlyMon The TOS say that commercial resale is not allowed and lots of them were resold by a private company in a scheme that tried to avoid sales tax. Chris Pretty sure that the Supreme Court just ruled that after you purchase the item the first time that you are allowed to resell it. EarlyMon Commercial resale, not individual resale, is the issue here - a gray market supplier. Look at the number of complaints from people who expected Google support and didn't think that it mattered that they were buying what they thought were the Google version only to find out that they were Verizon models. That's one of the things that the store I referred to evidently did. Who mail orders a Pixel from a New Hampshire store to save the cost of taxes added when we all know what the only outlets are? Santos Chavez It actually does say that isn't allowed, hence why they initially banned several accounts the first time. It was a breach of their TOS, and it still is. It's likely Project Fi saw these phones as stolen and blacklisted them. james fuston "You may only purchase Devices for your personal use. You may not commercially resell any Device, but you may give the Device as a gift." So if you purchase the device and resell it in New (unopened) condition, yeah. Fi could also pretty easily make the case that if you purchased the phone and turned around to sell it before the expiry of the original installment plan that you had purchased it with the intention of reselling. MisterAlex That's still not a commercial sale. If I go to the store, buy a Nintendo Switch, and immediately list it as a brand new Switch on Craigslist, I'm not a commercial seller. I'm still an individual selling something that's fully within my "first sale" rights to sell. james fuston Yeah, that's true if you're reading the second, and only the second, sentence there. The first one pretty clearly states "You may only purchase Devices for your personal use" MisterAlex If you think that reselling a personally owned item goes beyond the bounds of personal use, you're kidding yourself (and so is anyone who thinks that line of thinking would hold water, legally speaking). First Sale is a very broad consumer protection, my friend. Once you buy something of your own, you can do whatever you want with it, including sell it. (Edit: in the States, anyway.) james fuston Yep! Totally fine for you to sell it. Also totally fine for Google to deactivate your phone when you've done something you agreed not to do at the time of purchase. It's then legally on you to prove that they overstepped. MisterAlex You're clearly not parsing what I'm posting. Selling privately owned property is within the bounds of "personal use." james fuston Seeing as Google specifically included a clause about gifting, I'd venture to say they disagree with you. MisterAlex That's fine. Sony also disagreed that it had done anything wrong by removing Other OS. james fuston Cool! So we agree that whether or not you believe Google's terms of service to be legal, it's entirely on the customer to take action after being penalized for a violation of said terms of service. MisterAlex It's always up to the wronged party to seek litigation against a wrongdoer. james fuston In that case, I have no idea why you started commenting on legality when I was discussing terms of service violations. Rather, I would have no idea why if this weren't the comment section. MisterAlex A TOS is not a legally binding agreement. You defended enforcement of a TOS when that enforcement went contrary to law. That's why I brought up the comparison to Sony's PS3 lawsuit (which it lost). james fuston I'm not discussing whether terms of service are legally binding. I'm discussing whether or not the action being described (selling the phone) violates the ToS. It does. MisterAlex And my counter was to point out that putting something in a TOS doesn't make it hunky-dory. In fact, it's quite possible for a TOS to violate law. As I've illustrated. bekifft This is where America is so great. Even if the TOS is unenforceable by law, it is technologically enforceable, obviously. So they do it anyway, and now the onus is on you the little guy to get the multinational corporation to knock it off. Vape John most likely carrier issues the blacklisting... so project fi is the culprit psychic99 More profit? The sell them $150 below market rates. That is not free. I don't know what is actually going on but I would suspect that the original owner did something wrong or unethical. To be honest Google's systems are weird. I ported out my nexus5x and it took them almost 3 months to Bill me for the remainder. So maybe the original person cancelled their card, played games with DPP, activated it for one day and did it again. And again. xyz Fortunately, you can just buy an iPhone and get top notch support. hunter2 So the answer is to buy everything new and toss the old device in the landfill? Kind of sad to see how people just roll over and let over-reaching companies basically decimate the second hand market so they can increase their profits. Jay Never said that and you know it. I said this is the risk you take.. It's as simple as that. trixnkix637 That's the risk you take for not buying from reputable sources. Buying used has risks. Sucks he found out the hard way. jb0nez But the article says it's not Google, it's the carrier who blacklisted. Whatever that means... hunter2 That makes no sense. The carrier technically blocks that IMEI on their network, but only after another carrier submits it to the blacklist. It would be like if you SWATTED somebody and then said "it was the police who came to your house with guns not me". pfmiller On top of that this seems like an abuse of the blacklisting system. The system is intended to discourage theft, not as a means for companies to get revenge on their customers. psychic99 That's not true. Companies have been blacklisting devices for years if tos wasn't met. I have bought 3 phones through fi and they are heavily discounted. Google doesn't do that for free they expect you to activate them on fi for more than one day. Also if you are buying a phone from an individual and not a dealer you are taking a risk straight up. I have had friend have their phones blacklisted when they have bought phones from people and then they turned around and reported them as stolen. Swappa is a marketplace not a arbitrator. They are facilitating a sale. You guys need to know the difference. PayPal is your friend. hunter2 That's dumb. The whole point of cancellation fees is to re-coup the cost of subsidies if you break the contract. By going a different route, the only people who are getting punished are the people buying these phones. psychic99 Lots of people don't pay them and I have seen numerous accounts where friends have bought phones and have told me they got a "deal of a lifetime" to find their devices blacklisted and guess what they were people who never paid off their termination fees or have sold them then reported them stolen. And as an individual you need to take responsibility, if you purchase anything through a private transaction you should ask for poof of sale, do they own it, have it put in writing, etc. That way if the seller does something illegal then you have a remedy. This doesn't derisk anything tho. This is good education for people, to know where responsibility lies and the risks of buying from an individual versus an established dealer. In the case of Swappa, you should buy via Paypal, so there is a remedy. You can chargeback your loss if this happens within 6 months (I have done this will unethical sellers), so they are not being punished they are being inconvenienced. But that is the RISK you take buying from an individual. hunter2 I know you want to see Google as the good guy here, but within these comments there are accounts from people who bought outright, and months later sold their Pixel's and now months after that sale are being contacted by the seller about the device being blacklisted. bekifft I think you're missing his point. It's not about Google being the good or bad guy, it's that buying something third party is inherently risky and he's right, you should ask for a chain of evidence that proves the device is legit. Maybe I'm also just tired of people claiming they can find things so cheap online, when most of it is scams like this, and just devalues the whole market. hunter2 You need to look through these comments. There are people here who bought their phones directly from Fi and after switching carriers their fully paid off phones have been blacklisted. They were the original owners and these phones were never sold. There are also people here who bought phones, used them for months, and sold them after they were fully paid off. These people are saying that the proper they sold the phones to are now coming back and telling them they're blacklisted. bekifft In that case that is indeed disturbing. I am a Fi subscriber though I bought my phone direct from the Google store. Sounds like someone made a big mistake on the back end. Lance Biddle I bought my phone from Project Fi, and it has become blacklisted after changing to another carrier. Google is definitely the bad guy right now IMO pfmiller Just because other companies have been doing it, doesn't mean that it's not an abuse of the system. It's clearly not what the blacklisting system was intended for. Lance Biddle How about when you buy the phone from Project Fi, decide to switch carriers and the phone you outright own becomes black listed. I cannot connect to the Verizon service I'm paying for. And Verizon cannot do anything about. And Google/Project Fi isn't. I've wasted way too much time on the phone trying to get this resolved. They have told me it could be 2-5+ days to get it fixed. WTF!! Never Google again. Never. J.J. I'm sorry. That sucks hard. ProductFRED Considering the original seller probably isn't going to pay people back, all Google did was fuck over a bunch of legitimate customers. iPhone reselling is also a big issue, especially on new releases, but you don't see Apple doing this. J.J. Agree 💯. Most of these customers involved (who probably have had hardware and software issues already on top​ of this) will never buy a pixel again! Cassidy James Blaede Just for the record, the majority of Pixel users likely never have hardware or software issues. I, my mom, and a couple of my friends have Pixels and haven't had any issues. You probably hear about issues on Reddit a lot because the only reason to visit the Pixel subreddit is to complain. 🙃 Jordan L no issues here too. J.J. Not a redditer lol, but many other sites show the issues(as low as they may be) and if you were on the fence about spending that kind of money, these stories alone may sway many Duder12 Yep. Just like iphone touch disease and early shutdowns. Tr3ple Never had those issues. xyz That's true. I personally don't know anyone who has been murdered. Therefore, no one gets murdered. Cassidy James Blaede I'd wager that the majority of people don't get murdered. 😉 Written Description My Pixel XL has performed flawlessly since its purchase and it's my first Android phone after using every iPhone from the first generation on. Google's AI is better, its cloud storage is infinitely better, and I don't see going back to Apple anytime soon. J.J. I'm glad you have not had issues.... Others however have Duder12 Not me. Corey Kinard 3rd Np. Duder12 Mines been great... atl3630 great here too. Cael Apple is not a "carrier". ProductFRED Neither is Google. They just use other carriers' networks. Either way, that isn't justification for what they're doing. Unless they plan on replacing everyone's Pixel (which looks like a hard no), they fucked over a lot of legitimate customers. I buy my devices off of swappa most of the time. Tell me how I would get this fixed if neither the seller nor Google want to take responsibility. marcusmarcus2 Google is an MVNO. Per https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-mvno-cell-phone-carrier-578673 "An MVNO is a cell phone carrier (such as a prepaid wireless carrier) that typically does not have its own network infrastructure and licensed radio spectrum" Apple is not even an MVNO carrier. drksilenc fi is a carrier... JD With Fi Google is a Carrier. Mitch Gray This just happened to my fiance's phone. I bought it on swappa for her birthday months ago because Google store didn't have any in stock and this morning it is blacklisted. I'm so furious. I have had every Google phone since the Galaxy Nexus and because of this policy I will never buy another phone of theirs. She is now stranded without a phone and has no way of using it for work at the busiest time of the year for her (she is a teacher and it's graduation week). Who do I contact about this? We shouldn't be punished because someone gamed the system. J.J. I feel so bad for you. I hope you get it resolved. This is an atrocity! J.J. Should definitely hassle fi/Google and let them know if they don't resolve you will never buy and tell everyone you know not to buy and so on jibust No, stop don't tell them that, they might not withstand the shock of loosing them. /S T4rd I would contact the seller of the phone and/or Swappa if they're the service you went through. If they're no help somehow, then contact Paypal if that's how you paid for it. Google isn't going to unblacklist the phone regardless of what you say to them. It's virtually impossible for a phone to be unblacklisted once it has happened, so you're going to have to just get a refund and buy another phone. A Person Good luck with that. I am hesitant to ever buy again from Swappa.. and I used to love, love, love them. I purchased a device that was blatantly not as described. I then contacted Swappa and they instructed me that it is now between me and the seller. So I contacted the seller via the sale page and was basically told: "ummmm, nah". datkidpatrick at that point you could have went thru paypal and filed a claim... T4rd That's why you buy from reputable sellers. The few minor issues I've had on there were resolved quickly. atl3630 yes, same here. To date I've never had a swappa problem that didn't get resolved and the people have been very helpful. Don't blame swappa for shitty sellers. Buy from reputable sellers (like me). yankeesusa Swappa only helps communicating. To resolve any issues you must file a PayPal claim. datkidpatrick contact the seller and see if they can contact project fi/google... King_Android Ijs, BBB is an extremely powerful tool in order to get your voice heard from Corporate asap...... Stephen Hicks If the phone is under warranty still, file an RMA claim and state the bluetooth isn't working correctly on the device and that you've already tried factory resetting the phone as well as reconnected all the bluetooth devices with no improvement. Might work? njn There is no warranty for second hand phones. JRock I purchased a bootlooping 6P off eBay for cheap, erasing/flashing firmware had same result, RMA'd to Huawei and they promptly sent me a brand new one. Mark Depending on the credit card you used to buy the phone, you might have an extended warranty that might cover this. atl3630 You can get your money back. Contact the seller through swappa and tell them the issue. They will likely tell you it's been to long, I don't care, etc. If so, then file a PayPal claim. You have six months PayPal protection. Document that the phone no longer works and send it back to the seller with tracking. Then PayPal will refund you money, no matter what the seller says. M3D1T8R But doing this will just end up screwing over the seller. PayPal will simply take the money from their account and refund it to the buyer. So that's not fair to the seller either. PayPal's "seller protection" is a fraud. And their customer service is a total joke. They should be boycotted. atl3630 How does that screw over the seller? The seller screwed himself when he sold the phone. His beef is with ProjectFi, not the buyer. Frankly the buyer shouldn't have to deal with this crap since buyers have no way to determine the history of a phone. The seller sold a phone that stopped working. That's on them. M3D1T8R Because, obviously, the seller doesn't necessarily know the history and every previous owner of every phone. What if it's a phone someone bought previously used. They used it for a while just fine, and resold it. Then this IMEI block thing happened. atl3630 Yeah, that would suck. But still, it's not the buyer's fault. If something happens and somebody gets cheated out of $500+ then you better bet people are going to exercise whatever option they can to recover their money. PayPal protection would do that for them in the first 6 months. ericshmerick So anyone who sells a phone is on the hook for its functionality until the end of time? GTFO of here with that. It's ridiculous and you know it. atl3630 Six months, moron. PayPal protection is 6 months. Like it or not, facts. Stop being a little bitch. Roh_Mish What if the seller had bought directly from google. AP mentioned about the trains but there doesn't appear to to be a link between this and that fraud. Also there are many cases where buyer on PayPal will request a reverse and never return the product, screwing over the seller. And PayPal won't do anything about this. vn33 That really sucks .. .especially to someone near and dear to you. I would be beyond furious! Hope everything works out!! Duder12 Swappa will cover you here. You are fine. Get the ball rolling. Anwar Imraan Lucas To me it seems that the original buyer had reported his credit card lost or stolen and is disputing charges on his card which in terms maybe blacklisting those devices as stolen.. blindexecutioner You do Google the service of endless beta testing their software on a way overpriced phone and they blacklist you. Nice. Lawrence Good, that is what you get for buying the Bezel XL ericshmerick OH YOUUUU!!1 theadamsegal Yet another reason I will not buy a Google device again. Tiberian For the record: Kyle Bennett is the owner and founder of HardOCP, not just a simple writer for the site. ;) Richard Gao Did not know that. Thanks! datkidpatrick this happened by to me as well... i sold my pixel 3 months ago and the buyer just informed me it was blacklisted... i had no clue project fi was doing this and legit thought the buyer was trying to scam me... i contacted project fi support and was advised it was escalated to be removed from the blacklist... i paid off the phone before i sold it... this is definitely a mistake by google/project fi... they should be correcting this soon... Jordan L Can a carrier just randomly blacklist IMEIs?! I guess so. I was reading this thread thinking 'well, people probably just bought a stolen Pixel unknowingly' but your case proves this wrong. Navneet Suresh Shitty move Google ! :/ Jay If this happened to me, I'd just return the phone to the seller, get refunded, and make them have to deal with this. Swappa made a huge fucking deal about refunding buyers after the Note7 debacle and it should be the same thing here. freshprince_87 I hope that Kyle guy reads your comment. This may help him Jay Honestly, Swappa needs to be pushing this harder. I sold my Note7 last year and despite the fact that the buyer could have gone and gotten the refund from T-Mobile themselves, they chose to take Swappa up on their suggestion of getting the refund from me. (Add to this that Swappa said if I didn't agree to the refund, they'd "suggest" the buyer take the issue up with PayPal as the device was not sold as advertised. Seriously..) datkidpatrick it isn't the sellers fault... and its something that can be fixed... Jay I fail to see how this isn't the seller's fault for trying to game the system and make a profit. This sure as hell isn't Google's fault.. so who do you want to blame then? The unsuspecting buyers? datkidpatrick it is googles fault... the point they referred to in november is completely separate from the issue happening now... the issue happening now is many pixel phones that were sold and originated from fi is getting blacklisted... i sold my pixel after paying it of legit and it just got blacklisted... now please tell me how i tried to game the system... Jay For all I know, you could be one of those shady scalpers too who tried to make a profit by gaming the system. The burden of fixing this issue should still lie on the sellers. If someone wants their money back, they have every right to make you do the legwork of figuring out how you'll make your money back. datkidpatrick I contacted project fi for the buyer and it is escalated... again the point is it wasn't my fault... marcusmarcus2 If you are just trying to sell 1 phone that you got and paid for without trying to "game the system" it is not your fault, but it is your responsibility as the seller to try and resolve the issue, which it sounds like you are doing. Who's fault is it? Hard to tell until Google releases a comment about why this is happening. Did they block these by mistake? Then it is Googles fault. Are they doing it to block the bulk buyers that were "gaming the system" and just went over board and blocked some extra phones that were not part of those that gamed the system? Then it would be the fault of Google and those that gamed the system that caused Google to make the choice. hunter2 I wouldn't say it's his responsibility. He's selling a device. If the maker of that device decides to flip a kill switch in 18 months and disable every device out there then why blame him. Google is flipping a kill switch an all kinds of devices (just below there is a comment from a guy who bought and paid for his phone, then later switched carriers and had his originally bought phone killed). Trying to blame middle men here is crazy. marcusmarcus2 I'm not blaming the seller. Please re-read. I said the fault is with Google if they are the ones that decided to black list them. It is the sellers responsibility to try figure out why a device they sold is blacklisted. If they did nothing wrong, then they should be able to get it unblacklisted by working with Google. From the looks of some of the comments on here, it looks like the buyer would not be able to get the device of the black list but the seller should be able to. Again, I'm not blaming the middle man. There is a difference between fault and responsibility. Fault sounds like it is fully on Google. Responsibility goes across everyone though with some having more responsibility. Buyer has some responsibility to report the issue to the seller instead of just reporting it to paypal. Seller has more responsibility than the seller because they would be the one who would be able to work with Google/fi to get it off the black list. Google/fi would have even more responsibility to explain why devices are being blacklisted and getting devices off the black list if they should not be on there. Max As a somewhat frequent seller/buyer on Swappa and Ebay I can say that this is definitely the sellers responsibility to fix the problem or promptly accept a return for a refund otherwise this isn't so different from a bait and switch situation. datkidpatrick how is it a bait and switch if i paid off a phone legit and decided to sell it after... 3 months later it gets blacklisted... this is a mistake by google and its their responsibility to fix... Max If you paid off the phone legit and didn't do anything shady then it wouldn't have been blacklisted and if it was you, as the original buyer, are the one with more authority to contact Google, not the second hand buyer, therefore it's your responsibility to fix it. The buyer with a blacklisted phone has zero reasons to believe that you were truthful in your description even if you were. datkidpatrick well i did contact project fi for the buyer and it is escalated... Max Then you're doing the right thing (taking responsibility) and hopefully this gets resolved quickly by Fi! Although I don't know if they can just un-blacklist a phone? Hopefully they can. ericshmerick If I buy a product from a retail store and 92 days later it has an issue, guess what they will tell me when I show up barking for a refund? Yeah, pound sand kid. That's what they will say. So why do Swappa sellers suddenly have the responsibility to refund forever ala Costco? I get people are pissy at the situation, but the seller isn't responsible for Google's shadyness here. Max We're not talking about "an issue" here because that's what warranties are for, we're talking about a phone reported as lost/stolen after being sold this could potentially mean a fraudster that didn't fully pay the phone or a thief that sold a stolen phone, I doubt any serious retailer would do that... By the way that's what buyer protections are for, Paypal has six months of protection and credit card providers can be very flexible if you explain your case well and you're in the right. If a retailer pull something like this they would never win a chargeback. Max We're not talking about "an issue" here because that's what warranties are for, we're talking about a phone reported as lost/stolen after being sold this could potentially mean a fraudster that didn't fully pay the phone or a thief that sold a stolen phone, I doubt any serious retailer would do that... By the way that's what buyer protections are for, Paypal has six months of protection and credit card providers can be very flexible if you explain your case well and you're in the right. If a retailer pull something like this they would never win a charge back and the manufacturer and distributor would never be involved in the original transaction or charge back, it would be up to the retailer to go after the manufacturer or distributor. ericshmerick But nothing shady or illegal is going on here. If I and the original buyer and I use it on project fi for two months, then decide to sell it. How does that suddenly implicate me as being some sort of shady criminal? I would simply be selling a legally purchased piece of hardware that was paid in full. Max Can you please elaborate how the buyer knows that you sold "a legally purchased piece of hardware that was paid in full" if he has a blacklisted phone reported as lost/stolen in the hands? Good luck convincing the buyer, Paypal and a Bank that you're in the right in such a situation... Luxferro If they sold you shady (stolen or not legal) products you'd be dealing with them. tnt These are not devices being bought from an official retailer. There's no need to question the history of a device bought from Costco. Swappa (and Ebay and Craigslist for that matter) are not the same type of market. It's the seller's responsibility to know the history (as much as possible anyway) of the devices they're selling. freshprince_87 I guess it's safer to buy a Verizon Google Pixel instead if you intend on reselling it later. So the future buyer isn't screwed by Google. That is such a ridiculous policy drksilenc have to have a line with verizon to do that though. Wendell Brown Apparently not, this dude says his WERE Verizon phones that were locked.... https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/6d2yse/2_of_my_3_google_pixel_phones_blacklisted_on_the/ Me Google is just shooting themselves in the foot at this point with the Pixel Yan Qin I just sold my Pixel XL and switch to Galaxy S8, I do think I was out of my mind that I actually bought Pixel at full price. Jordan L anyone resell a project fi phone NOT through Swappa and have it blacklisted? maybe ProjectFi blacklisted only Swappa phones(still a strange move if it was on purpose) Jagermeister 2 of my 3 Pixel phones showed up blacklisted 2 days ago. I made a reddit post yesterday of my issue. I though it was part of an insurance fraud scam. https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/6d2yse/2_of_my_3_google_pixel_phones_blacklisted_on_the/ I had originally though our phones were from Verizon not Google Fi. We were happy Pixel customers that are now considering purchasing different phones because Google can report as stolen whenever they feel a Google Fi device was not transferred to a new owner per their TOS. How can any user purchasing a pre-owned or "new" Google Pixel be sure that it isn't a Google Fi device and won't be blacklisted in the future? Max Johnson Note to self, don't buy second hand Google devices. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Note to everyone: Don't buy first hand Google devices. Max Why? Mine works perfectly fine and so far it's the best phone I've ever owned. Dana Yeah, it's fine as long as you don't get it from Project Fi because you can't sell it if you want to upgrade to a new device. Max LOL, what? I simply bought it directly from store.google.com, no issues here and I can provide proof. This is something related to phones sold through Fi. hunter2 Congrats, scroll up one comment and you'll find a guy who's phone is blacklisted despite him being the original owner and being fully paid off. To answer your question of "Why", it's because not everyone is as comfortable gambling with their money as you are. Max 1) It was blacklisted by the carrier, not the manufacturer. 2) It was blacklisted after it was resold, sucks but as far as we know it doesn't affect the original seller, there's a difference there. 3) We don't know yet why this really happened. 4) Even with all of the above, I don't see how it fits in a "Don't buy first hand Google devices." statement. Maybe if you tell me "Don't deal with Project Fi service" I could somewhat agree. hunter2 http://disq.us/p/1iz7ts3 Sorry, should have permalinked the comment since the order is moving per votes. That guy was the original owner and claims to have been paid off. Moved to Verizon at some point and had the device he originally bough directly from Google blacklisted. Max Well that negates my point 2 and sucks even more. But still the blame here points 100% to Project Fi and not the phone itself nor Google as the manufacturer of the phone. Something really strange is happening with Project Fi devices and hopefully they will find out soon if it's an error, incompetence, sabotage or maybe even hacking. hunter2 I guess it depends on how willing you are to absolve the parent company of things a specific branch is doing. It would be like saying "don't blame MS, it's the IE team who makes the browser" during the IE6 days. Max Legally is evident that the responsibility is on Google but if you think that the group in charge of designing and manufacturing the Pixel has any minimal clue about what happens inside the group of the MVNO Project Fi then you're frankly clueless about how such a huge company works. By the way IE and Edge sucks but Visual Studio rocks and I'm liking more Windows 10 recently but I guess I should avoid using everything Microsoft because IE really sucks, right? hunter2 If a decisions like these can be made without going far enough up the chain of command that you're dealing with some higher ups, then I don't really want to know how this company runs. It's enough to tell me that I can't really trust them because you can't really depend on a company keeping in line with their corporate ideals when individual units can work with this much impunity. Avoiding/disliking MS was never about IE sucking. It was about IE being openly hostile and damaging to the web. This complaint was obviously projected at Microsoft themselves since no one believed that the IE team was working in a bubble. I don't know how old you are so maybe you weren't around when all this was going on. It's not about disliking a company because one or some of their many products are inferior. It's about disliking them because they employ user hostile tactics and you don't feel like you can support that (or at the very least want to punish them in the tiny way you can by voting with your wallet). Max So you already got an official response from Google about this? Can you share it? Because so far I have only read guesses about what is happening and nothing official yet. I'm old enough to have used MS-DOS 5 & 6 as well as Windows 3.1. That doesn't change the fact that saying "don't buy anything from a company" based on one division issues is just silly. If Google officially says that all of this was planned then maybe you could have a point, until then you're just stretching facts to prove a weak point. hunter2 I don't need to fill in the facts. I'm saying either way it's bad. The facts are that this happened. Additional facts about why it happened are irrelevant Max Well, if you're happy thinking like that be my guest, I guess some people is unable to see the colors and think the world is black and white. hunter2 For people whom this isn't a mundane thought experiment but are actually in a position where they need to buy a new device (not everyone is able to be without their phone until Google ultimately resolves this); the shades of gray in this scenario don't change their circumstances. The facts are that they have a phone that was remotely disabled. I'm assuming your shades of gray are the how's and why's of that? How is that of any consequence to these people? Steve_Jobroni Shut up, troll. DanSan got em! Matt This will be great for their resale value. ericshmerick Swappa comments: I GEEVE U $200 BUY NOW FINAL OFFERS!! JD Wooooo! Go Pixel, I'm definately not going near any Google hardware with a 1000ft pole now.I may use my 1001ft pole. In Many states, and at least in Canada this is not legal, you can't blacklist a phone for ToS violation. There's a very narrow list of reasons for a device to be blacklisted. Cuong This is a really shitty move from Google. At least sent a notification few days in advance and offer a way to appeal. What if a person was in an emergency situation? Imagine the lawsuit for that, Google. Why customers have to suffer because Google can't control their resellers? ericshmerick 911 always works. segag Thats Fuck all! Snowsky Mountain This may seriously make me rethink my use of Google hardware (especially phones). Stevie Do no evil Google. Do no evil. My Dixie Wrecked Yeah, they got rid of that mandate years ago. Seriously. Look it up. mxwp lol, yeah it was pretty funny. but i give Big G props for being somewhat honest about that. "hmm, we're huge now and so just cannot help to do some evil" Corey Kinard Just looked​ it up. Looks like it's still in place for Google. Alphabet's is different l though. It's "do the right thing." Sruly J Bought an unlocked Pixel yesterday for $334. Before I send it in to get checked and fixed by Google, I really should check the IMEI (normally I'd have the IMEI first, but the seller didn't give it to me). Michael D’Ambrosio "Someone with an answer." That'll get you far with Tech support. Smh vn33 Does the blacklisted phone works out of US, say in Canada? I assume yes, if it's the carriers that are doing the blacklisting. that said, it would really dampen my desire for a phone from Google. Stevie I am crossing my fingers that they don't come after my Nexus 6. Already bought and activated. There's no going back right? speedy1979 So to clarify google is randomly blacklisting any google pixel that is resold. I actually considered buying a ProjectFi device sometime ago; so glad I didn't go through with it. Kris Crowley I have fi service. When you buy a phone through fi you got a discount or a phone that you can't get through the Google store if you want. There is a disclaimer that if you buy it and never activate it that you will be charged additional Monies within 30 days. Now without knowing isn't possible that A the phone was bought at a discount and B the additional fee was levied but never paid? trixnkix637 Know the risks of buying used people. Do your homework. Asking where the seller bought the phone originally could've prevented all of this. Can't blame Google because someone tried to game the system both ways. marcusmarcus2 Know the risks of not using commas, people. You should never buy people, whether they are used or new. Rony Hmmm, is there a difference between a new and a used person. I've scoured the forums and haven't got a clear answer. marcusmarcus2 You would have to ask them before you buy them. They usually know when they've been used. But again, you should not buy any people. Def Ref But if you try to rent people, you start hearing words like "solicitation" and that's no fun. marcusmarcus2 Don't rent them either. While we are at it. Do not borrow, loan or steal people. Def Ref Is enticement allowed in your no fun world? Asking for a friend. marcusmarcus2 I don't see a problem with enticement as long as that enticement does not lead to stealing people. "No fun world"? You mean my world where I think people should not be viewed or treated as items/property? If yes, then yeah, I guess it is a no fun world. Def Ref Lighten up, Francis. marcusmarcus2 Lighten up, Francis? https://38.media.tumblr.com/39ef7347a58e308e67a5bd01cd124431/tumblr_nsld6lafvE1qh124lo1_500.gif Def Ref https://youtu.be/0OnpkDWbeJs That the title is misspelled AND mispunctuated is bonus. trixnkix637 Didn't NY and NV allow for the renting of people or is that wishful thinking? Asking for a friend. Rod This was so good, I had to sign into Disqus to upvote. trixnkix637 Buying people has been around for ages. Can't just stop now because of commas. marcusmarcus2 Buying used has been around for ages. trixnkix637 And so has it's risks. ericshmerick Wow I feel bad for the Swappa sellers who are getting PayPal charge backs right about now. Alexander Z Great This was the response I received. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/948da6656e25823e8dc529c4571fbc2d347f5e820ee9b7c91844d48c9745a112.png DanSan owner of the device ≠ person who purchased. way to go google. InnocentEd News flash this could happen with any phone from any manufacturer on any network that is resold used. I've had it happen with 2 iPhones and Apple could have cared less. You buy used, you take the risk. It's amazing how even credited tech journalists assume devices on Swappa are always going to be 100% safe. If Project Fi were not allowed to be resold via T&S then it's no diff than blacklisting a resold stolen phone...they had every right. Bewear This is why we can't have nice things. Rony Honestly this makes total sense. Its technically stealing the phone if you buy it for a discounted price and you dont activate it and sell it again. I think they made the right move. raffr It's not "technically" stealing. If you purchase a product at the price requested, you did not steal it. IF, big IF, in your purchase agreement it states you cannot resell the phone without activating it first, then google has a case. Serge Cebrian if you are paying for the service ... you are still paying for it even if you keep your older phone or a better phone if you want to unless you stop paying then its stealing ... but not if you keep the service// marcusmarcus2 They could have blacklisted these phones for that reason. But they could have also been overzealous when blacklisting devices and blacklisted numerous other devices that people did not do that with. It may have been the right move to block those that did do that, but if they inadvertently blocked additional devices, then hopefully they make the right move and unblock those devices that should not have been blocked. newtonfb Not new. Wife got a 5x on swappa. Phone was originally on FI but never taken off the account. We tried to activate it on FI but they did we couldn't until the owner released the phone? It worked fine on any other carrier. Had to get a new 5x Lance Biddle I paid off my pixel through project fi. I recently switched to Verizon. Yesterday Verizon notified me that my phone had been reported as stolen! When I awoke this morning my service had been disabled by Verizon. The support from Project Fi has been abysmal. What do I do to fix this? Corey Kinard Go to Reddit. Get ready for talks with the Better Business Bureau. Keep contacting Fi, keep screenshotting all the correspondences, you get all the buyers info in order to prove you are the original device owner. You don't fix this, you didn't cause it to break. Google fixes this. Everyone affected just has to light a fire under their ass. tnt Keep pushing / escalating with Project Fi. Ryan from GroupTweet I bought a Pixel from Tradeport USA (NH based company, shit!) about 3 months ago. The phone is on T-mobile right now and still currently working (fingers crossed). From my interpretation this appears only to be affecting Pixels bought through Google Fi - and perhaps not ones bought via Google Play store unlocked? Is that correct? Is there anyway I can check to see if my pixel was in fact sold via Google FI vs Google Play? Really hoping I don't wake up to a bricked phone in the next couple mornings... Sruly J You could contact Google, provide them with the IMEI, and they could let you know if it was bought through Google Play. Ryan from GroupTweet Thanks - but don't want to risk tipping them off that my phone should be on the blacklist :( Sruly J But wouldn't they know anyways if it should be blacklisted? I mean, how else would they have blacklisted so many phones this week? lauriedesautels So I have the Pixel and was planning on selling it via Swappa after my credits end from another phone. They ended up giving me a brand new Pixel XL but their service has become horrible where I live. So please correct me if I am wrong but if the Pixel is paid off and I switch carriers/ my Pixel is a paperweight? (I don't plan on using the phone on another carrier after 3 mo). ericshmerick According to this place, you can never sell it. You must carry it with you to your grave. Robert Montoya I have a Pixel that is currently blacklisted as of 5/23/2017 I bought it from Swappa... Google says they will lift the ban in 24 to 48 hours... That was 24 hours ago.. Phone still Blacklisted Wendell Brown I must have missed where it was shown that these deactivated phones were on Project Fi. As best I can tell, the only link to Fi is from an OLD article about the guy reselling phones several months ago. Is there any proof that this is in any way Fi related? MadJoe I have to say, if Google ever blacklisted my phone in a misguided sour-grapes attempt to punish the person who sold it to me, and without compensating me for it I would be rather angry. It would also be the absolute last Google product I ever purchased. As it is, this story has me glad I don't own anything more than a $25 Chromecast that I never use. I was seriously considering the Pixel 2 as my next phone, but not any more. If they were going to be such babies about the phones being resold, they should have vetted their buyers a little better. Corey Kinard It doesn't look like they were making any money off of you in the first place... Second-hand buyers/ bargain hunters rarely go out and pre-order $800 phones. Maybe you're different. They're definitely fucking up, but considering how little the pixel one sold and how much money they make I'm not sure they'll care about this any which way the wind blows. Same way Apple can just outright tell their customers to go fuck themselves over certain problems. MadJoe The problem is that too many people will ignore a company's unscrupulous behavior. If more of us would punished them by taking away access to our wallets, they'd think twice about trying to screw us. But people are lazy and lack commitment. So you're absolutely right, Google won't feel any hit by my deciding not to buy any more of their shit because a shit-ton of blind lemmings will gladly line up to jump off that spot on the cliff I chose not to use. And when a couple of them get screwed, they will cry "why isn't anyone else interested in helping me?" as the rest of the heard ignore them. On the bright side, the cycle will continue ad nauseum until I'm in a hole in the ground. Bruce Considering the ridiculous amount they are charging for the phones (Apple pricing without the Apple level support), this just about kills the resale value for a Pixel. Who the hell is going to buy a used phone for $500+ (because the original cost is so high) if their phones get blacklisted months later. And who the hell is going to buy the phones at the original price, when resale value will drop like a rock. And this doesn't even take into account all the BS that comes with the phone to begin with. 2 years of guaranteed OS updates. Hardware issues (Bluetooth, speakers, water resistance...) which don't get acknowledged amid finger pointing. Insufficient inventory even if they were open to replacements. The 128GB version (the 32GB is too little and the 64 GB doesn't exist) costs almost a $1000. The first time they tried this with the Nexus One, it didn't go well. This doesn't seem to be going much better. The Galaxy Nexus couldn't be upgraded because of drivers. The only real hits have been the Nexus 5 and the 6P. UniBroW *clutches iPhone 7 plus despite it's inferiority to android* Tj Hariharan Wait, do we actually KNOW that the phones that are blacklisted were originally purchased for reselling for profit? All i got from this article was that the phone was originally purchased from Project Fi.. RTNDO128 My phone was effected by this. I've been having issues with no T-Mobile service for the past couple of days on Project Fi. After reading this article, I used the Swappa IMEI checker and what do you know, my phone is reported "lost/stolen". I bought my Pixel on eBay at the beginning of January. Now I'm beyond their 30 day gaurentee. What an absolute clusterfuck. RTNDO128 My phone was effected by this. I've been having issues with no T-Mobile service for the past couple of days on Project Fi. After reading this article, I used the Swappa IMEI checker and what do you know, my phone is reported "lost/stolen". I bought my Pixel on eBay in the middle of February. Now I'm beyond their 30 day guarantee. What an absolute clusterfuck. Y2J You have 180 days in Paypal. RTNDO128 Thanks, I filed a claim with them. Hopefully this situation is covered. Max Did you contact first the seller? Otherwise it's a dick move to file a claim without first giving the seller the opportunity to see if he collaborates... RTNDO128 Thanks for your opinion. As stated, I'm beyond the 30 day eBay guarantee window. I created a "dispute" through the PayPal Resolution Center, which sends a message directly to the seller. PayPal is totally uninvolved with the dispute until I choose to escalate, which will only happen if I cannot get this resolved with the seller first. I just want to have our conversations documented in the event that the seller does not want to deal with this situation. Ken Kinda weird Google said that IMEI can't be blocked by manufacturer, I'm sure that's true. But what when manufacturer is also technically the carrier? Da_James Are you saying that "buying" a device in the USA doesn't mean you own it? Just SUE. Steve_Jobroni > as it's the carrier and not the manufacturer that has the ability to blacklist devices Do people not read the full article anymore? There seems to be a lot of Jabroni's blaming Google when it's the carrier that can only do the blacklisting. Sir_Brizz But that carrier is Project Fi, aka Google... Aleksandr Ivanov Change IMEI, problem solved! AbdulB1 lol Cassidy James Blaede I'd be interested in hearing how widespread this actually is, and a response from Google. My mom bought a Pixel from Swappa because Google was out of stock, and she's been loving it. I'd hate for her phone to become a brick because of this. Leonardo Baez I see a class action demand on the horizon? Đức Thành I'm a die-hard Google fan, but wow does Google need some fixing. justmy2pennies2012 There is one simple way Google can prevent the second hand market from making a profit. 1. Provide enough stock for all those who want to purchase the device! :) Bonus: Price the device accrodingly!! I gave up trying to buy one new from VZW and the Play Store. MisterAlex Did getting a Pixel phone through Fi require signing away your rights regarding "first sale?" And is that enforceable? RayNeverLearns You are Android Police. You might want to stay more up to date on this story and keep your readers updated, especially one that has a big impact on one of the purest Android flagships. http://www.techspot.com/news/69452-pixel-phones-project-fi-showing-up-blacklisted.html datkidpatrick happy to announce the phone i sold has been taken off the blacklist after communicating with project fi... so if you're affected by this contact google or more specifically project fi support... RayNeverLearns I believe Project Fi has done this for all affected Pixels. I didn't contact the person who sold it to me (Craigslist 7 months ago... wouldn't know where to even start) yet my phone was whitelisted earlier today. A little pain and it took almost 3 days, but a good resolution. datkidpatrick thats great... happy it's fixed... Amir What an idiotic move by Google. That's suicide. HardWired I wonder how long before Tesla implement a similar system in their cars :) Sorry you signed an agreement, the car has been disabled because you decided to sell it to a used car salesman for resale.

Name: Subject: Message: Why you won’t be using Bluetooth 5 on your Galaxy S8 just yet – Gary explains Featuresby Gary Sims1 week ago 44 735 13 The Bluetooth Special Interest Group (Bluetooth SIG) announced Bluetooth 5 during the summer of 2016 and then towards the end of that year the new specification was officially ratified and we started to see Bluetooth 5 appear in hardware, first in development boards and then in consumer devices, most notably the Galaxy S8. Last month I got hold of a couple of Bluetooth 5 enabled nRF52840 development boards from Nordic Semiconductor. Using these I was able to test the real world capabilities of Bluetooth 5 and also cut through some of the marketing hype about the new standard. Most notably I was able to clear up the huge confusion around the ideas that Bluetooth 5 offers 4 times the range and twice the speed. In fact it turns out that Bluetooth 5 does offer (almost) twice the throughput when the two communicating devices are close to each other, but towards the edge of the possible range I demonstrated that Bluetooth 5 has the same throughput as Bluetooth 4. At the same time I busted some of the myths about Bluetooth 5 offering 4 times the range. The way it has been presented is that the 4x range and the 2x throughput work hand-in-hand, whereas the truth is that the extra range is only available when using a special connection type built into Bluetooth 5, known as a CODED connection. These CODED connections offer a very low throughput, around 109Kbps, but with the advantage of greater range. Bottom line, forget any dreams of taking your Bluetooth 5 enabled speakers out into the yard while your smartphone is in your bedroom and still getting a good connection speed. For more details on all this you really should watch my video the truth about Bluetooth 5. After my testing with the development boards, I turned my attention to the Samsung Galaxy S8. My aim was to hack together a quick app which allowed me to test the throughput between two Galaxy S8 handsets over Bluetooth 5. So I went to Samsung’s developer website to look for a Software Development Kit (SDK) or maybe some documentation about how to access the Bluetooth 5 features, but I found nothing. Thinking that maybe Android already supported Bluetooth 5 I headed over to the official Android Bluetooth documentation, but again nothing. At this point I was becoming a bit worried, did the Galaxy S8 really support Bluetooth 5? My first port of call was the Bluetooth SIG website. I was able to find there the official certificate that showed that from a hardware point of view the S8 does indeed support Bluetooth 5. But which bits of Bluetooth 5? Support for the 2 Mbps and Coded connections are optional in Bluetooth 5. The only connection that is mandatory is the 1 Mbps connection speed from Bluetooth 4. Fortunately the Galaxy S8 supports the 2Mbps connection speed, however it doesn’t support the CODED connections. This means there is no “4 times the range” support in the Galaxy S8. I emailed the PR people at Bluetooth SIG to try to get some more information. They replied quickly and very nicely, however they weren’t able to add much information. The only information that they could share about the S8 was what is on the certification page. This means there is no '4 times the range' support in the Galaxy S8. While I was talking with the Bluetooth people we (as in the Android Authority team) tried to get some answers from Samsung and from Google. Google At Google I/O, my esteemed colleague Kris Carlon sought out some clever engineers from Google to ask about Bluetooth 5. What we have found out is that Bluetooth 5 will be officially supported in Android O. In fact it is already in the developer preview versions of Android O and the source code has been published in the Android Open Source Project (AOSP). Android O will support the new 2Mbps connection and the new CODED connection type (for that extra range). It will also support the new longer advertising packets. So it looks like Google’s support for Bluetooth 5 in Android O is pretty good and includes everything we need and expect. However, before you get too excited, we must remember that Bluetooth 5 functionality will only be available in handsets which have the relevant Bluetooth 5 hardware (i.e. chipset). You can’t convert an older Bluetooth 4 device into a Bluetooth 5 device just by upgrading to Android O. What this means is that the Samsung Galaxy S8 is well positioned to get native Bluetooth 5 support from Android, but only when Samsung releases an Android upgrade from Nougat to O. Samsung This leads me to one conclusion, you can't use Bluetooth 5 on the Samsung Galaxy S8. While the Bluetooth SIG and Google were very helpful, I can’t say the same about Samsung. Several different members of the Android Authority team have asked different representatives in Samsung about the status of Bluetooth 5 in the Samsung Galaxy S8. We have had a couple of replies thanking us for our question and a promise of a reply, but so far nothing. It has been more than two weeks! Since there is no support in Android N for Bluetooth 5, there is the possibility that Samsung has included support itself or that there is an SDK which developers can use to access the Bluetooth 5 features. The normal port of call for such information is developer.samsung.com/galaxy. Samsung provides a range of software development tools for accessing features like multi-windowing, fingerprint recognition, the S Pen and so on. However there is nothing about Bluetooth 5. Specifically for the S8 there is information about the Edge Panel and Samsung DeX, but no Bluetooth 5 documentation. This leads me to one conclusion, you can’t use Bluetooth 5 on the Samsung Galaxy S8. Wrap-up The Galaxy S8 has the right hardware to support Bluetooth 5, but it doesn’t have the right software. If Google and Samsung follow last year’s playbook then Android O will be released sometime this summer (maybe August) and then Samsung will get to work on releasing a version for the S8. The upgrade to Nougat arrived for the S7 in January/February of this year, so it is likely that the S8 will get Android O during the first part of 2018. Until then the Bluetooth 5 capabilities of the S8 remain locked and unusable.

If that is the case, then take a back seat, fake news, because what we could have is a deliberate right-wing propaganda machine that is altering the way that voters perceive candidates and issues. It could be much more detrimental to our democracy than any fake news. The Guardian has revealed that extreme conservative ideology is cycled through popular social media sites through algorithms so it becomes pervasive, dominant, and constant. Social media manipulation is trouble for democratic society everywhere. Cambridge Analytica’s Data Mining and Trump’s Victory One company that drives data, Cambridge Analytica, goes so far as to take credit for Trump’s election win through its ability to manipulate media messages targeted at persuadable voters. According to the homepage of its website, Cambridge Analytica (CA) uses data to change audience behavior. If you click on the “Political” tab, you can eventually find a description that says, “CA Political’s industry-leading data services help you to find, understand, and engage with voters more effectively. Our services can be purchased individually and tailored to your needs, but combined they offer a fully end-to-end campaign package. CA Political provides clients with a truly quantifiable approach to campaigning.” It is a company that openly brags that the “expertise and intelligence” it provided to the Trump campaign spurred his election win. How did CA’s data analysis lead to what CA describes as the “most remarkable victory in modern U.S. political history?” Why is CA now suing The Guardian for a 2017 article titled, “Robert Mercer: the big data billionaire waging war on mainstream media?“ That article now has a subtitle, “This article is the subject of a legal complaint on behalf of Cambridge Analytica LLC and SCL Elections Limited.” What exactly happened with the Trump campaign data, according to The Guardian‘s inquiry? And do the forces behind his win continue to use data manipulation to influence the US government today? How Trump Campaign Data Links to Google Searches How does a 21st century data-driven campaign for an unlikely candidate for President of the USA work? By designating three integrated teams — research, data science, and digital marketing — CA was able to move millions of data points into targeted messages directed at “the most persuadable voters and the issues they cared about.” The purpose? Hit them with messages at key times to get them to take action to vote for Donald Trump. Doesn’t really sound like anything different than any other contemporary campaign, does it? Just wait. Data mining to target voters is only one aspect of the controversy around CA and The Guardian. In December 2016, writer Carole Cadwalladr chronicled how some topics, when searched on Google, resulted in responses that “were being dominated by right wing and extremist sites.” In an interview, Jonathan Albright, professor of communications at Elon University, North Carolina, says that his research reveals that right-wing news sites attempted to do what most commercial websites try to do: find tricks that elevate their placement on Google’s PageRank system. They try to “game” the algorithm. Albright’s mapping of the news ecosystem has divulged that millions of links between right-wing sites were “strangling” the mainstream media during the 2016 Presidential election. CA was cited by Albright as a company that sites like Breitbart could use to track people as they surf the web, including their visits to Facebook. They wanted to direct specific ads to their advantage. According to Albright: “They have created a web that is bleeding through on to our web. This isn’t a conspiracy. There isn’t one person who’s created this. It’s a vast system of hundreds of different sites that are using all the same tricks that all websites use. They’re sending out thousands of links to other sites and together this has created a vast satellite system of right wing news and propaganda that has completely surrounded the mainstream media system.” Ordering of search results does influence people, says Martin Moore, director of the Centre for the Study of Media, Communication and Power at King’s College, London. He explains, “There’s large-scale, statistically significant research into the impact of search results on political views. And the way in which you see the results and the types of results you see on the page necessarily has an impact on your perspective.” The results of Albright’s research that a vast network of right-wing sites feeds Google searches make me a little sick to my stomach. The Case Study of Donald Trump for President: “A Full-Scale Data-Driven Digital Campaign” Let’s return to the case study of CA’s data collection and analysis for the Donald Trump presidential campaign. Let’s try to figure out what CA did that was different — and how The Guardian‘s expose was so controversial that it led to a lawsuit. CA built 20 custom data models to forecast the voter behavior of 180,000 individuals. Their digital marketing efforts led to a large-scale operation with 8-figure ad budgets and an infrastructure that supported all aspects of the campaign, “influencing voters where and when it counted.” The responses from each individual polled by phone or online were matched with existing data in CA’s database. They analyzed numerous topics — “from their voting history to the car they drive.” As they did so, CA correlated individual behaviors with voting decisions. These models allowed CA to predict the way individuals would vote, even without the backdrop of knowing their specific political beliefs. In essence, consumer and personal behaviors led to data organization and predicted which candidates the polled individuals would most likely prefer when it came time to vote. Then CA organized voters into different categories and determined the best way to influence them through marketing. With these audience segments identified, CA created and implemented a marketing strategy for Trump fundraising. Get Out the Vote programs, heavily laden with persuasive motifs, included targeted advertisements in key battleground states that were directed to the most persuadable voters. Designing Algorithms for Social Media Manipulation What’s essential to understand here is that CA collaborated with “30+ ad tech partners.” Cadwalladr at The Guardian wrote that “Google’s search results on certain subjects were being dominated by right wing and extremist sites.” CA’s marketing operation utilized a number of platforms, including social media, search engine advertising, and YouTube. By using the social media that polled individuals tended to frequent most often, CA was able to appeal to voters using language and imagery in ways very familiar to this audience — ways they would understand and to which they would respond strongly. “We used our data infrastructure to target voters who could be influenced in the most meaningful way. For example, if they cared about healthcare, targeted adverts directed them to websites explaining Trump’s views on the matter.” Trump’s views on healthcare, according to a October 9, 2016, Business Insider article, were criticisms about the Affordable Care Act as having “resulted in runaway costs, websites that don’t work, greater rationing of care, higher premiums, less competition, and fewer choices.” Words like “runaway,” “don’t work,” “rationing,” “higher,” “less,” and “fewer” worked to demoralize persuadable voters who may have already been struggling with health care costs in addition to other living expenses. If, as Albright’s research indicates, millions of links between right-wing sites were responsible for “strangling” the media, CA’s data mining and categorization during the Trump campaign may have worked as triggers to persuade undecided voters that the Trump Republican narrative was normal, sensible, and fiscally responsible. CA kept polling and assessing the Trump campaign progress in an real-time basis, with 17 states pinpointed as essential battleground states and 1500 people polled weekly in those key areas. More important than any other element, CA could also identify which voters were likely to support Donald Trump. Through social media portals that rerouted right-wing messages in deeply complex cycles, potential voters viewed right-wing rhetoric so frequently that it became a familiar message. Dr. Jonathan Rust, director of Cambridge University’s Psychometric Centre, says, “The danger of not having regulation around the sort of data you can get from Facebook and elsewhere is clear. With this, a computer can actually do psychology, it can predict and potentially control human behavior. It’s what the scientologists try to do but much more powerful. It’s how you brainwash someone. It’s incredibly dangerous. “It’s no exaggeration to say that minds can be changed. Behavior can be predicted and controlled. I find it incredibly scary. I really do. Because nobody has really followed through on the possible consequences of all this. People don’t know it’s happening to them. Their attitudes are being changed behind their backs.” So, CA influenced voter intention, and it also inspired people to take specific actions. What were the results? “Donations increased, event turnouts grew, and inactive voters who favored Trump were motivated to get out and vote on election day.” In the final months, reports based on the new data that emerged from polling were sent daily to the Trump campaign. Those reports demonstrated how voters might be shifting their perceptions of issues and candidates. What might that have looked like? Well, with CA’s ability to assess state-by-state reactions to any political event, they were able to understand any unexpected shifts in voting intention. The constant FBI Director Comey announcements about Secretary Clinton’s emails come to mind. With great pride, CA argues that its “work informed the campaign strategy and meant key voters, who might otherwise have stayed home, were reached in their own backyards. This ultimately contributed to the extraordinary victory of Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election.” CA’s efforts toward the Trump campaign, with data-driven marketing techniques, changed behavior in target populations. In other words, CA assisted the Trump campaign to use technology platforms to give voice to racists and xenophobes, according to Cadwalladr in another story in The Guardian. And the results continue to snowball. Trump boasted that Apple CEO Tim Cook called to congratulate him soon after his election victory. “And there will undoubtedly be pressure on them to collaborate,” says Moore at the Centre for the Study of Media, Communication, and Power. There are other reasons to be really concerned over and above Google right-wing search domination and CA’s 30+ media technology partners that have contributed to social media manipulation. What if one person has donated $45 million to different Republican political campaigns and another $50 million to right-wing, ultra-conservative nonprofits? Is he, as Cadwalladr suggests, “trying to reshape the world according to his personal beliefs?” Hedge Fund Billionaire Robert Mercer: The Man behind the Trump Data Mining & Manipulation He’s a brilliant but reclusive computer scientist. He made his fortune in language processing science that fed into today’s AI. Afterward, as joint CEO of Renaissance Technologies, a hedge fund that makes its money by using algorithms to model and trade on the financial markets, he became a billionaire. What has Mercer done to single-handedly promote right-wing agendas? He: funded the Heartland Institute, renowned for its climate denial and across-the-board fight against regulation; donated to the Media Research Center, which has a mission of “correcting liberal bias;” propped up Steve Bannon with $10 million for Breitbart; and, reportedly holds a $10 million stake in Cambridge Analytica (CA), which was spun out of a bigger British company called SCL Group. The Guardian claims that, “with links to Donald Trump, Steve Bannon, and Nigel Farage, the right wing U.S. computer scientist is at the heart of a multi-million dollar propaganda network.” And we are its tools: our social media conversations and interests are being redirected to win votes through ideological mechanisms that are invisible to us. Maybe it’s a coincidence that Greg Gianforte, a Republican technology executive who was charged with assault, defeated Rob Quist, the Democratic candidate, in a special election for Montana’s at-large House of Representatives seat. Or maybe not. Emma Briant, a propaganda specialist at the University of Sheffield, says that CA and other data mining sites like it have the technological tools to effect behavioral and psychological change. The social media sites where we go for leisure and relaxation are a new space where international geopolitics is being played out in real time, and we’re pawns in the game. It’s a new age of persuasion and social media manipulation, and, if Cadwalladr’s research stands up in court, we need to be hypervigilant about the sources we believe and the inferences we make based on those sources.

Anyways, the company had a marketing conference this week and it revealed that it wants to make money on Google Assistant. No kidding. New Beauty & the Beast promo is one way Google could monetize Home. cc: @gsterling @dannysullivan pic.twitter.com/9UlukSocrO — brysonmeunier (@brysonmeunier) March 16, 2017 How? Well, for starters, perhaps you’ll see more of those promotions during the “My Day” briefings from your Google Home. That one for Disney’s “Beauty and the Beast” revamp was an unpaid experiment, but it’s just one option the tech giant can take. The likeliest path — also the one of least resistance — is to use an existing ad product where suggested retailers in traditional search results will also get mentioned when a user asks, “Hey, where can I get XYZ?” Google Assistant may also play off of Alexa’s ability to buy stuff from Amazon in an instant, but instead of Amazon, it’d be through partner retailers through its search engine operations. Each sale would earn Mountain View a cut of the revenue. We’re not exactly cutting brave and bold new grounds like Burger King did, but Google could use less of the controversy as our data overlord at this point.

[Update: False alert] Google says gifting in the Play Store is "Infeasible," marks it as "Won't Fix" in the Issue Tracker Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/05/26 4:14am PDTMay 26, 2017 15 Plus 1 on G+ 67 Share on Facebook 45 Share on Twitter Total Shares127 Google News Update 1: 2017/05/26 5:03am PDT False alert. Issue was closed in 2013 because it was submitted to the wrong tracker. You know how almost every app or software store lets you buy apps and gift them to someone else? Well, you better put your dreams of ever doing that on Android to rest. Or burying them under 10 feet of disappointment. Someone at Google recently took a look at the Issue Tracker, saw the issue labeled "Implement Gifts within Android Market," which has been added back in 2010 when the Play Store was still the Android Market and which has gathered over 1100 stars and hundreds of comments from users requesting app gifting, and decided to be the bearer of bad news because you know what, this is "infeasible" and Google "won't fix" it. But the writing has been on the wall for a few days; we could have seen it coming if we had been playing closer attention. Credit gifting disappeared from the US Play Store on May 16, and then the support page for Google Play gift cards and promo codes was updated on May 17 to replace the "Google Play credit gifts" section with "Google Play book gifts." That change clearly shows that credit gifting was completely gone, not a glitch, and that from now on, you can only gift music and books, but definitely not credit. Above: Pre-May 17. Below: Current support page. Put 1 and 1 together and you understand that the future of gifting or buying someone credit on Google Play is grim. You better kill your dreams of purchasing apps/games for your friends or employees, gifting a niece or nephew some Play credit for new games educational apps, or encouraging your parents to use a certain app by buying it for them. I still can't wrap my head around the fact that Google, the behemoth that can make AI understand every word I say and predict the news I want to read and the traffic on my way to work, is saying that app gifting is "Infeasible" when other app stores have clearly managed to make it feasible. I'm sure there's a reason, but I can't think of any that would be unsurmountable for Google but not for others, or any that would apply to apps and games but not to books and music. The latter traditionally carry a lot more licensing and legislative limits than apps/games. As a consolation, you can turn to Google Play gift cards and Family Sharing in the countries where they're available to share or send apps and games to others. Update 1: 2017/05/26 5:03am PDT False alert. Issue was closed in 2013 because it was submitted to the wrong tracker. I apologize for the false alert. It looks like the issue was actually marked as "Infeasible" back in 2013 because it was posted to the wrong issue tracker and couldn't be fixed by the AOSP team but had to be submitted to the Google Product Forums instead. The issue has just picked up a lot of comments recently, which brought it to the attention of our tipster and thus our inbox, and with the recent disappearance of the Play credit gifting option, we incorrectly assumed there was a link there. What remains true though is that credit gifting is completely gone and you can only send music and books now. There's no proof that app/game gifting wouldn't make an appearance at some point, so I suppose there's a silver lining somewhere.

Rita El Khoury Yup, as shown in the screenshots, Books and Music gifting is available. But credit buying for others or gifting apps/games is now a dead dream. FaultException It was marked infeasible because it was on the wrong issue tracker, and it was back in 2013, not recently at all. See comment #108 on the issue where it was marked. Suicide_Note Not a big deal, really. demarcmj Agree. Low tech is better... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/276e854598d2a91aa3a795a84e4ecbec4f4f587c8e3da3c55b968c90ad4ec402.jpg Kristian Ivanov https://gfycat.com/RevolvingEdibleCivet h4rr4r Totally wrong article actually. This issue tracker is not for the play store. Thomas Gladdines If I ever had to implement gifting apps I would make it an in app purchase and then simply show a 100% off coupon.

After six months in this job opportunity and managed to get remunerated totally 36 thousand usd... Normally I acquire almost eighty bucks/h and work for 3 to 4 hrs daily.And tremendous factor regarding this task is the fact you can easily handle your time any time you do the job and for just how long as you may wish for and you earn a paycheck weekly........ learn by clicking here how to do it right now jirka maly Google incopetents are more obvious in 6 apps for communication: Allo, Duo, hangouts, messages, voice, G+ Sorry (not really), but Google is led by complete idiots absolutely without a proper tactic thinking Kristian Ivanov I was thinking of posting a really witty comment about this, but the disappointment level was so low that I kind'a don't feel it's worth the effort. Nicholas Conrad Witty comment status: won't fix. Kristian Ivanov It was going to be awesome though, it involved old people, polar bears and a skateboard...oh well, at some point in the future when this is in the news again I'll post it :c Daniel But there's a good reason for it, it's not just that Google is evil: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/36916787#comment108 Status: Won't Fix (Infeasible) This report applies to a mobile Google application or service, and the issue tracker where you reported it specializes in issues within the Open Source source code of the Android platform. We are not able to provide support for Google products in this issue tracker. Please report this issue in the appropriate Google Product Forum at https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!forum/en/ God of chaos It all makes sense now! demarcmj Reading!?! What is this sorcery? Rita El Khoury Ugh... My ctrl+F skills failed me, I admit. Also my little knowledge of how the Issue Tracker works. I could see when or why it was marked as Infeasible so I incorrectly assumed it was now, when the comments flared up again. Nicholas Conrad Don't get down on yourself Rita, we all have days like this at work. Even knowing the premise of the article was mistaken, I'd rather read it again than another JRE video summary article. Rita El Khoury Thanks... I guess?! demarcmj The issue tracker is partly at fault. If you hover over the resolution in that side panel, the mouse turns to the finger like it's a link... but clicking on it doesn't do anything. You would think it would take you to the resolution post for more details. But nope. Rita El Khoury Exactly. I was thinking there's something wrong with Chrome or my connection and restarted it, but clicking wouldn't take me anywhere, so I was like... well, seems like this doesn't show an explanation. demarcmj Doesn't work in Firefox or IE either (haven't tried it in Edge, or whatever they're calling the Windows 10 browser). Do they have an issue tracker for the issue tracker? Mark R. Andrachek, Jr. No. But they might have a product forum. Which nobody at google will ever check, and some "community volunteer" will suggest your reboot your PC. Rita El Khoury Arghhhhh... You're right. Many of us here at AndroidPolice looked at this and we failed to see that it was marked as Infeasible in 2013. I'll edit the post to ad that info. In our defense, many of us at AP looked at this tip and thought the status change was new, especially with the way comments were flaring up on it in the past day and with all the changes to Google Play credit gifting. Daniel No problem! :) Thanks for adding the info FaultException It wasn't marked as infeasble recently, it was marked in 2013, because it's the wrong forum (the tracker is for AOSP/Android itself) See comment #108: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/36916787#comment108 demarcmj Yup... and most of the comments since then are people bickering about not wanting to receive emails every time someone comments on the issue. Real productive thread they have going on over there [eyeroll] Zomby2D I'm guilty of contributing to the email pollution. I had the issue starred but I haven't been getting email notifications for the longest time from this. I don't even remember noticing that it had been closed all that time ago. I just started receiving notifications again last week and figured that the ticket being closed was the reason why people were suddenly complaining. Having the reason for closing it lost in the sea of comments didn't help. Rita El Khoury Right. Fixing the post to reflect that. Dennis Ulijn I can also see the fact that people buy 100 apps with a stolen credit card and sell them on the black market, like G2A or G2play. You talk about a lot of other stores doing this already, but the uplay and steam store have had a lot of problems with this and still have those problems, without a good way to combat it. Besides that, how will you solve the VAT system? Who pays? I can see how a lot of people want it, and of course i don't mind having the possibility, but there are more problems than 'just implement it'. Carson Saldanha I think it's due to security reasons but that sucks... h4rr4r Read the update! couldn't be fixed by the AOSP team but had to be submitted to the Google Product Forums instead. h4rr4r Good retraction, update! Rita El Khoury "because it was posted to the wrong issue tracker and couldn't be fixed by the AOSP team but had to be submitted to the Google Product Forums instead." Isn't that enough of an explanation? h4rr4r I was at first talking about just the update line. But on reading the full explanation I thought it was pretty good. Ideally the update line at the top would say something about why not when. Rita El Khoury That's an automatically truncated blurb that our WordPress theme does at the top. I'll manually change it to clarify that in a bit, I was just in a rush to update the post before we got more comments telling us how wrong we were. h4rr4r YAY! krazyfrog Apple has had App Store gifting for all content since years now and somehow it's "infeasible" for Google. 🙄 Rita El Khoury Refresh your page ;) Peter World Citizen I had seen people got fired for lesser mistakes. ;) Rita El Khoury We'd be firing half the AP team and Artem. Many of us looked at this and didn't notice. Guess the post I/O haziness hasn't dissipated yet. Mark R. Andrachek, Jr. Google's Issue Tracker recently got a re-vamp. They can control, I'm sure, what the closed states are for things in their own tracker. They really need to have a closed/won't fix state that indicates that the issue has been raised in the wrong venue going forward, if they want to keep the issue tracker limited to just AOSP. These kind of things keep coming up in the AOSP issue tracker and _will continue_ to come up in the AOSP tracker if nothing changes. They don't expose issue tracking for anything else. Finding these product forums at all, much less the right one, is an exercise in madness. And then when you do find them, they're typically staffed by unpaid community volunteers. Chances are high that nobody from Google will actually see your issue, much less respond. It's like shouting into the void. Funem They should just make it so you can purchase an item, then chose to install it or create a sort of promo code which you can then just give to someone to use. They could tie it in to the promo code system they have now. Until its claimed you could still retain the option to install it by using the code yourself. prwnd Dear Community, I suggested this and I apologise because I did not find it was changed in 2013.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Hamza Shaban By Hamza Shaban May 26 Follow @hshaban China’s 19-year-old Go player Ke Jie reacts during the second match against Google’s artificial intelligence programm AlphaGo in Wuzhen, eastern China’s Zhejiang province on May 25, 2017. AFP PHOTO / STR / China OUTSTR/AFP/Getty Images test AI: 2, Humanity: 0. A computer designed by Google researchers has beaten the world’s top Go player for the second game in a row, capturing the best-of-three match in Wuzhen, China, and confirming AI’s supremacy in what many consider as one of humanity’s most complex boardgames. Ke Jie, a 19-year old Go grandmaster, began the game with stellar play, said Demis Hassabis, the CEO of DeepMind, the artificial intelligence firm that created AlphaGo, at a press conference, according to the Associated Press. Google acquired his company in 2014. But the Chinese prodigy was eventually bested by AlphaGo. In South Korea last year, DeepMind’s machine defeated another championship-caliber player, Lee Sedol, stunning some in the field of artificial intelligence. “For the first 100 moves it was the closest we’ve ever seen anyone play against the Master version of AlphaGo,” Hassabis said after the game, according to the Verge. “Today’s game was different from the first,” Ke said Thursday at the press conference, according to the Verge. “AlphaGo made some moves which were opposite from my vision of how to maximize the possibility of winning. I also thought I was very close to winning the game in the middle but maybe that’s not what AlphaGo was thinking.” AlphaGo’s sudden dominance over human competitors has surprised AI researchers, who had suspected that machines would take much more time to master the intricacies of Go. The program began as a research project three years ago. In a 2016 Nature article, Google said that AlphaGo had beaten European champion Fan Hui, five games to zero, in a match that took place during the previous October, behind closed doors. That marked the first time any computer program had beaten a professional player at Go. The program went on to beat more stand out players. AlphaGo’s wins have revealed the ways that computers can augment human capability and spur new ways of thinking. And more broadly, the computer program’s feat helps validate a more optimistic take on the future of automation and AI, one in which humans aren’t necessarily displaced, but are enhanced in some way. This week’s match in China also demonstrated the very human limitations that can surface amid competition, primarily how stress and emotions can hinder decision making.“I was very excited. I could feel my heart bumping,” Ke said after the game, The New York Times reported. “Maybe because I was too excited I made some stupid moves.” Beyond the game of Go, DeepMind scientists believe that the technology that powers AlphaGo can help societies develop better ways to conserve energy and boost health research. The third and final game pitting Ke against AlphaGo will take place on Saturday, as part of Google’s “Future of Go Summit.” Another match will feature two professional human players facing one another, but each will have their own AlphaGo teammate. business on-innovations innovations Dallas shooting updates News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 follow-dallas false after3th false Please provide a valid email address.

Google Maps v9.54 prepares to add saved locations for your school and gym, notification channels, and what looks like a task list [APK Teardown] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/05/26 6:22am PDTMay 26, 2017 41 Plus 1 on G+ 69 Share on Facebook 51 Share on Twitter Total Shares161 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Article Contents 1 Teardown 1.1 Saved locations for School and Gym 1.2 The 'Other' Notification Channel 1.3 A few new prompts 1.4 A task list called "Nearby Need?" 2 Download An update to Google Maps v9.54 began rolling out to users through the beta channel yesterday, but it doesn't appear to have any visible changes going live quite yet. However, a teardown of the apk does bring a few hints about what to expect in the future. There are clues about a couple of new saved destinations like the Home and Work slots that have become so useful, the first stirring of support for Android O's notification channels, a few new "promos" to get people interested in various features, and a very curious feature that might turn out to be a task list of sorts. As usual, we've got a link at the bottom to download this update to sideload if you're not interested in waiting for Google to deliver it to your device. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. Saved locations for School and Gym If you find yourself regularly using the Home and Work saved locations for quick navigation, you'll enjoy this one. The Maps team is expanding the list to include two more common destinations: your gym and your school. <string name="GYM_LOCATION">Gym</string> <string name="SCHOOL_LOCATION">School</string> Since those two strings don't really include any specific telltale signs that they're intended to be default saved locations, I've included the two previously existing lines for Home and Work for comparison. It's pretty obvious that the naming convention matches up. <string name="HOME_LOCATION">Home</string> <string name="WORK_LOCATION">Work</string> There is also a newly added icon for education, which I would naturally assume will go with the School destination. There doesn't appear to be a similar icon dedicated to the Gym slot, but it's not as if Google can't easily color-fill the existing fitness icon. Nevertheless, this one missing icon might be a hint that Google won't make these new destination slots available until a future update includes the missing icon. These two new entries will obviously operate just like Home and Work for the purposes of navigation and quick route selection. And as always, users don't have to actually link these slots to real schools or gyms. I'm sure a lot of people will welcome this simple improvement because so many of us travel to more than just work and home in a typical day. The 'Other' Notification Channel I'll just make a quick mention of this topic since it's not really that interesting. Google Maps is going to have a notification channel on Android O titled "Other notifications." <string name="OTHER_NOTIFICATION_CHANNEL">Other notifications</string> I doubt this will be the only custom channel for Maps. After all, there are several subsections in Settings dedicated to each notification type, so we'll probably see the channel list grow a fair amount in the future. I would assume the Maps team is still trying to decide how to best organize the app's notifications. This "other" channel will probably become a placeholder for most of the notifications until they are organized into suitable channels. A few new prompts I normally skip changes that are meant to advertise existing features, but sometimes the focus of banners and notifications can give a little insight into the features and apps that may not be performing as well as expected or simply need user awareness. The latest Maps update includes three new promos. The first banner is for the Google Trips app. Launched around this time last year, Trips is basically an itinerary management app that's also intended for making local recommendations. Trips probably doesn't have a very substantial user base yet, so it's not hard to imagine why Google is trying to breathe a little more life into it. code <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_TITLE">Take your travel info with you</string> <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_TITLE_WITH_AREA_NAME">Take your %1$s travel info with you</string> <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_BODY">Reservations • Things to do • Day plans</string> <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_DOWNLOAD_LINK">Get Google Trips app</string> <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_DISMISS_LINK">No thanks</string> The next addition is intended to get users to try out the recently launched location sharing feature. It's pretty normal to show prompts to get users only newly released features, so there's nothing unusual about this one, but you can probably expect to see it in your navigation setup soon. code <string name="CAR_TI TLE_JOURNEY_SHARING">Share journey</string> <string name="JOURNEY_SHARING_PENDING_PROMPT_TEXT">Share your trip with %1$s</string> <string name="JOURNEY_SHARING_PENDING_PROMPT_TTS">Sharing your real-time location with %1$s until you arrive.</string> <string name="CAR_MENU_START_JOURNEY_SHARING">Share journey</string> <string name="CAR_MENU_STOP_JOURNEY_SHARING">Stop sharing</string> The final promotional banner will belong to the always familiar Local Guides program. As usual, it's going to encourage users to contribute to Maps for points. The one interesting oddity is that these strings have "v2" in their names. It's possible this just means they are for a new set of promos, or this might hint at a revised version of the points program. I would expect the former, but it's at least worth acknowledging the latter is possible. code <string name="POINTS_V2_PROMO_TITLE">Reach new Local Guides levels</string> <string name="POINTS_V2_PROMO_TEXT">Now earn more points for your reviews, photos, edits, and adding new places.</string> <string name="POINTS_V2_PROMO_GOTO_STATS">SEE YOUR LEVEL</string> <string name="POINTS_V2_PROMO_OPEN_HELP">Learn more</string> A task list called "Nearby Need?" There's very little to go on for this topic, but it looks just weird enough that I suspect there's a feature brewing in there somewhere. A pair of new layouts were added with the name "nearby need," one of which defines the look of a list, and the other is for items in that list. There is also a single string with a related name and just the word "navigate" for text. <string name="NEARBY_NEED_NAVIGATE">Navigate</string> /layout/nearby_need_item.xml /layout/nearby_need.xml Based on this very limited amount of information, it does sound a little like a shopping list of sorts. Perhaps less like a grocery list and more like a list of chores or tasks – e.g. getting new tires on the car, picking up some materials for a weekend project, and buying new clothes. I would assume each item goes into a list and Google Maps will make it easy to navigate to the next nearest place where each of these things can be taken care of. I'm not actually sure if these are related, but there are also three new images to be found in the resources, and they certainly would fit with my theory. The first is for creating new tasks, the second is for completed tasks, and the final one is for "old" completed tasks. I suppose the old one might be for things a user did on previous days but hasn't removed from the list. This is all guesswork right now, but many people have been asking for ways to use Maps to get through chores, and this feels like the first hint of something like that. The one aspect that's not yet hinted at, but I certainly hope to see, is a feature that will sort tasks efficiently so people can choose the shortest (or fastest) route to get everything done. I'll keep watching and follow up when there are more developments.

They are used when you go to Your Contributions -> Check the Facts/Uncover Missing info. I think after all this time those two are still only for lvl 5 local guides... so yeah. Cody Toombs Right, the look of the images aren't new, but the files containing those images are. Or said more clearly, there are now multiple copies of those icons. mmark27 I sure would like there to be a "Work" and then a "Parking for Work" section for those that don't park right next to their office. Point being, if I want walking direction/estimations, give them from my office. If I want driving directions/estimations on time, know that I have to walk to my car, then drive from my parking location. The School addition will be good to finally have pop up automatically now though. Cody Toombs If you're not going to use all four slots for their intended purpose, you might just assign one of the others to be your work parking. Frankly, I would have liked these saved slots to have custom labels, since some people don't fit into this one shape. For example, I know somebody that has to travel to two different sites for the same job, and another friend that was enrolled in two different schools at the same time. It's not like one of these destinations can't go into the "Gym" slot, but it would be nice if the titles could make sense. mmark27 Right. I now have my "Work" location saved as my parking lot, which is silly, but it's the only way to get decent estimations. Your fix is what I'll be doing otherwise unless they fix it. The subtly though in this situation is El Goog knowing that the Work and Work Parking are linked existentially, so they can decipher where my body is and estimate from there, etc. Same can be said for Home and Home Parking if not directly on site. Would seem like Google's apartment-city-dwelling-first mentality would be more amenable to this off the bat. I agree that we should be able to have free labels on places and also as many places as we can stomach estimations/notifications on time to. Google knows where I am at all times....make it actually useful, guys. henleyb I work from home and Google would keep asking me to set my work address which is of course the same as my home address, it was a small but annoying thing. :) Cody Toombs I hated that for years. I've been working from home in one capacity or another for more than a decade and it took far too long to see Maps lighten up on having a different Work address. Austin Spangrud Sure would be nice if maps got integrated assistant into it. None of the commands and home commands that I have integrate with the Voice button in maps. Oh and In b4 where's my speed limit pop up Cody Toombs Speed limits are still limited geographically. Since I was in the Bay Area last week, I finally saw them pop up for the first time on my phone and in Android Auto. Funny enough, I now have a Speed Limit toggle in settings on one phone, but nowhere else :/ And now I'm probably not going to see the speed limits again for a long time. Paul_Werner Yeah and we used to have them and they disappeared. At least it did for me here in the Milwaukee, WI area. Same for when I travel to Chicago Nicholas Matranga Finally, it was so annoying to have to save my school address as my work address just to get commute updates. mike shwilly Grow up Maxr1998 Had to do the same, I'm very glad they implement this option now that I will have finished school in less then a month... (And haven't visited it for anything except a few exam-days since late April..) Hamilton Jimenez Vasquez Finally, Im glad that we can save more pinned-saved choices other than the usual Home and Work, although I would prefer to customize them on my own in the same manner we customize the saved list. I could make a really good use of few in my mind like Church, Work2, University, etc. Jon Xuereb Couldn't you use this school one for University Hamilton Jimenez Vasquez I used the word University just an example, the point is that it would be great to customize those pinned saves using our own creations. Taylor Hardy I work from comfort and ease of my property or home, through doing easy gigs that only takes from you a Computer and web connection and I am also joyful than before...

Basically I make near 80 bucks/hr and work for three to four hours every day.And excellent point relating to this work is that you can easily handle time and effort while you work and for how long as you prefer and you generate a paycheck per week........ learn by clicking here how to do it right now Paul_Werner I can't wait to see that "nearby need" implemented. Your guesswork on it sounds like it could be a really useful feature. h4rr4r Why are these static names? Why can't I add random strings and assign them saved locations? Ken Vincent what ever happened to speed limits? I thought that was on the verge of being a thing more then a year ago. UKTK8 "In the coming weeks" Meaning whenever Google d#$% well pleases. Jon Xuereb Lawyers I'm assuming dmo580 Yet Waze and other GPS apps have no issues. How about just displaying my current speed? Ken Vincent Not only that, but google provides speed limits as a service. I would imagine that is where Waze gets their speed limit info. https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/roads/speed-limits Jon Xuereb Because Google Maps is exponentially larger in terms of user base, and google is a bigger target for lawsuits Ken Vincent Waze is wholly owned by Google. They are not even an Alphabet company, they are Google. Jon Xuereb Still the size of the userbase affects the their risk assessment icyhotmike why not just let us add "Saved" locations such as Home and Work and whatever else we want? Damn Google in control of everything. makapav My God the Google apps and ecosystem are becoming such a clusterfuck with no sources of truth for data points. All the information is spread across random places. Richard Oldroyd I do use home a lot but for the others like gym I save as a contact and nav just as quick. Richard Oldroyd I'd love maps to display my current speed and advise what the speed limit is. Obviously they would have to add a warning saying they can not be held responsible for displaying an incorrect speed limit. I'd also like to see us be able to choose what is displayed underneath where they show destination time and miles to go, it would be useful to see arrival times at all stops not just the one you are currently naving to. Sathiya Moorthy Karan Really usefull information Regards, Sathiya Moorthy K developeit.net Jason List/Task ?? Why does Google keep messing with reminders/task ? Just create a dedicated reminders/task app already and move on. I hate that my reminders are spread out all over the place. Inbox, Calendar, Assistant, Keep. Get it together Google.

Name: Subject: Message: How OEM skins benefit stock Android Featuresby Robert Triggs1 week ago 31 1084 34 We all have our own reasons for loving Android, ranging from our favourite OEMs design language to a great feature that can’t be found elsewhere, or perhaps just a great value price point. This is mostly thanks to some healthy competition and a sprinkling of strong product diversity. But this isn’t just true for hardware, Android software can be just as diverse, as OEMs attempt to put their own spin on things in a bid to stand out. Some more successfully than others, it has to be said. Love them or loathe them, various OEM skins have enhanced and even innovated enough on stock Android to even become incorporated as key features in future versions. Despite the odd disaster, on the whole custom OEM skins and software have been a good thing for the broader ecosystem. Here are just some of the ways that OEM skins have benefited stock Android. Notification toggles and quick settings To start our trip we’ll go all the way back to the days of Gingerbread, that’s all the way back to Android 2.3 for those who prefer to deal in version numbers. We may take them for granted today, but notification toggles – the speedy way that you quickly turn your WiFi or Bluetooth on and off – and other quick settings haven’t always been within such easy reach. This feature actually made its debut courtesy of Samsung. It first appeared in the company’s Touchwiz 4.0 software built on Gingerbread, and the same feature wasn’t supported by Google until the launch of Ice Cream Sandwich (Android 4.0). That’s not a massively long gap between the two, but Samsung was a good year ahead of Google on this one. We should also give a hat tip to the rooting community too here, as they were also ahead of the curve and brought this particular feature to a wide range of devices before it was officially a core feature of Android too. I’m sure many of you veterans will fondly remember rooting and/or installing apps in order to stick convenient toggle buttons in your notification tray. Power Toggles anyone? See also: ‘Notification Dots’ bring notifications to your icons - Diving into Android O 3 weeks ago Multi-window Heavy multi-taskers would probably struggle to get by without multi-window support these days, and it’s now considered an important enough feature to finally be included in the AOSP as of Android 7.0 Nougat. However, multi-window is much much older than that, and a number of OEMs have included such a feature for years. Even Google talked about the idea back in the Honeycomb tablet days. The two most prominent OEMs supporting multi-window tools have been LG and Samsung. LG debuted its version of multi-window, known as split-view, back with the G3. Samsung introduced its version of Multi-Window even earlier, at the launch of the Galaxy S3. Although it should be noted that app support was much more limited in the features’ early days than it is now. This is certainly a piece of software that has improved with time. Interestingly, Samsung is still ahead of the curve when it comes to multi-window support, having also long including the ability to resize floating windows as well, which is particularly handy for Note users. LG also equipped many of its flagships with a similar technology called QSlide, which appeared all the way back with the Optimus G. Code for this feature has been spotted in core Android too, under the name Freeform Mode, but isn’t officially supported just yet. Miracast and content streaming Google’s Chromecast is the company’s most successful hardware product and has brought cost effective smart TV features and content streaming to a huge number of consumers. Casting is now an integrated part of Android and even Google’s Chrome browser. Although Chromecast and “casting” might now be household names, this technology actually just Google’s take on a bigger and older industry standard – Miracast. Miracast is a peer-to-peer wireless screencasting standard that uses Wi-Fi Direct connections to transfer audio and video data to another compatible device, usually a Wi-Fi enabled TV. Miracast has been supported in Android since version 4.2 and was quickly adopted by a wide range of OEMs, despite being dependant on OEMs implementing compatible hardware and software. A number of OEMs actually supported this technology before it was baked into stock Android too, including Samsung’s Galaxy S3 and Note 2, which ran Android 4.1 out of the box. Chromecast, on the other hand, uses an HDMI port, allowing it to be connected to devices that don’t normally support streaming. and also allows devices to multitask while streaming content. I should point out that Chromecast is not based on Miracast technology, so it’s not a like for like comparison. However, by supporting Miracast and Wi-Fi streaming in the early years, OEMs have certainly helped content streaming become a livingroom phenomenon. Fingerprint Scanner API Much like casting, fingerprint scanners are now viewed as an almost essential feature in today’s Android phones and software support is now firmly embedded in stock Android. However, Google itself didn’t do all of the work on the fingerprint API that is now being used to secure a wide range of apps. Much of the early work on fingerprint technology came from Samsung and LG, in order to keep up with Apple’s iPhone. Samsung debuted its first fingerprint scanner inside the Galaxy S5, which shipped with Android 4.4.2 KitKat. Due to this being an OEM specific implementation, the Galaxy S5 and the Note 4 only worked with Samsung’s in-house fingerprint API designed specifically for its hardware. The universal Fingerprint API wasn’t introduced into core Android until 6.0 Marshmallow, due in no small part to the cooperation of a number of OEMs. Thankfully, support in stock Android meant that software developers didn’t have to use OEM specific SDKs anymore in order to support the feature. Now all Android devices with a fingerprint scanner use the same API, making it much easier for developers to create supported apps. From originally just using your finger to unlock your phone, continued development now means that we can use our fingerprint to verify financial transactions and log into a variety of apps. Full screen app pages Collecting a wide range of app data onto a single page is now a staple of many an Android OEM skin, and often extends to include fitness data and social media updates, as well as news from various sources. Modern examples include Samsung’s Bixby Home and the Google Launcher, but the pioneer of this particular feature as part of a stock experience was HTC’s Blinkfeed. Blinkfeed first appeared inside the HTC One M7, which was on the scene way before Google implemented a similar idea inside its stock launcher. Other OEMs were also pretty early on this bandwagon, Samsung offered up news pages on its flagship phones via Flipboard Briefings, which came preinstalled on some Galaxy S6 and S7 handsets. LG also introduced a similar idea called the “Smart Notice” widget with the G3, that attempted to provide additional information about traffic, weather, and memos. This type of data collation and contextual information wasn’t always hugely useful at the time, but in a way it was also a precursor to today’s increasingly popular virtual assistants. Themes glorious themes Now we all know that various OEMs have tweaked the look and feel, as well as the features, of stock Android to help make their software look more distinctive. While opinions about aesthetics will always fall prey to individual tastes, some OEM efforts in the theming space have had a bigger impact on the scene than just introducing their various flavor. I’m talking about the Runtime Resource Overlay (RRO), or Layers as it’s also known, which is used by a number of ROMs for their theme engines, including Sony’s Xperia, CyanogenMod, and a selection of other custom ROMs. The Runtime Resource Overlay was originally developed by Sony in order to support its Xperia Themes options because stock Android, which was on Lollipop at the time, didn’t provide adequate capabilities. After some revisions to security, Sony’s Runtime Resource Overlay was eventually merged into stock Android. As a result, all OEMs now have access to these customization tools, even though Google still doesn’t use or publicise the feature. Samsung, LG, HTC, and others are all using at least part of RRO for their theme engines, making it perhaps one of the largest concealed contributions to the way that modern OEM launchers look and function. Wrap Up Clearly, there have been plenty of instances throughout Android’s history where OEMs have implemented major firsts ahead of stock Android, which in time have become core components of the OS itself. Likewise, stock Android has undeniably shaped the way that OEMs implement certain features for the better too. And this is just a short list of some of the major examples. Even those who prefer the look or clutter free nature of stock Android surely can’t deny that OEM features and software have had a positive impact on many aspects and features of stock Android. Whether this is as superfluous as as themes or button placements, right through to the deeper APIs and software that we all now use everyday. They’re an essential part of the ecosystem, even if certain models or skins aren’t to everyone’s tastes. It might be a tired message at this point, but the fierce competition in the Android market has been a major benefit to the ecosystem as a whole. Don’t you think?

Google launches ads measurement system for cross-device campaigns on YouTube, DoubleClick, GDN The Ads Data Hub is designed to give marketers impression-level insights for campaigns served across multiple devices. Ginny Marvin on May 26, 2017 at 2:17 pm More The ads measurement system that Google initially created for analyzing YouTube campaigns now includes data from the Google Display Network and DoubleClick. Google announced the expansion and the beta release of Ads Data Hub this week. The expanded scope of the cloud-based system further underscores the industry’s shift from relying on cookies to user and device IDs for tracking and reporting on ad performance as mobile usage has surpassed that of desktop. Ads Data Hub is designed to help advertisers measure the value of their campaigns as ads are distributed over an ever-expanding number of devices. Omnicom Media Group signed on as an early test partner. Ads Data Hub offers anonymized cross-device impression-level data from campaigns running on YouTube, Google Display Network and DoubleClick Ad Exchange. Marketers can hook in CRM, DMP or other marketing databases into the system to analyze campaign impact on the customer journey. Ads Data Hub runs in Google’s data warehouse, BigQuery. Marketers cannot extract any of the impression-level data from Ads Data Hub; Google says that’s for privacy reasons. Advertisers can give third-party measurement vendors including comScore, DoubleVerify, Integral Ad Science, Moat and Nielsen access to the system. However, those vendors must still rely on Google’s own data for measurement, long a pain point for advertisers who have been pushing Google (and Facebook) to lower their walls and support independent tracking for measurement and verification. Currently, the Ads Data Hub only supports analysis, but Google says it will eventually enable advertisers to “act on the insights they get from Ads Data Hub and buy media with greater precision.” About The Author Ginny Marvin As Third Door Media's paid media reporter, Ginny Marvin writes about paid online marketing topics including paid search, paid social, display and retargeting for Search Engine Land and Marketing Land.

The most recent gathering of the FYI Book Club had readers discussing Cathy O’Neil’s “Weapons of Math Destruction,” a lament on the overuse and misuse of complex, often flawed algorithms and mathematical models — and the sometimes scary impact of numbers on our own lives. Read more: An interview with author Cathy O’Neil “I had no idea so many algorithms were used,” said Jerry Bakker of Olathe. “People don’t understand the math models. They think that since it is math and the answer comes out of a computer, it must be true. But not necessarily.” Added Pat Schneider of Kansas City: “The pervasiveness of gathering data and using it wherever a business can is a little frightening and annoying. We all complain about the Facebook algorithms and the ads on Google. These data miners are gathering information from so many places. It makes me want to go into Google and search all sorts of interesting things just to mess with the research.” The room exploded in laughter, and attendees started listing outlandish search terms they would plug into Google. “This mathematical tool of modern technology is increasing the disparity of income,” said Clif Hostetler of Kansas City, Kan. “It’s enraging how these algorithms cause businesses to target insecure and economically disadvantaged people.” Janelle Sjue of Kansas City wasn’t surprised that lower-income populations are the target. “The algorithms look at correlation and not causation,” she said. “We have to separate the person from race.” On the bright side: “GPS works well for people who need it. Spam filters clear out bad emails. And some courts are using new algorithms to reduce recidivism. But the answers are not always reliable, and people don’t understand the limitations of the mathematical models.” Susan Tuncten of Kansas City also noted the helpful side of the financial algorithms. “On the positive side is the FICO (credit rating) score. It’s transparent. You know what to do to increase it or improve it,” she said. “That’s somewhat fair.” Hostetler asked, however, “Was it more fair than the small-town banker who knew everybody? Maybe FICO is fairer than the good-old-boy network.” For Peggy Brockschmidt of Kansas City, “The scariest chapter was the one on for-profit universities. The most vulnerable people are the ones who need the loans, and they get damaged.” Said Tuncten, “There are so many variables among the students, it’s impossible to measure or compare accurately.” Her daughter, Sara, chimed in: “These algorithms are created to make sense of data, but instead of improving our understanding, it’s as if people are changing their own behavior to make the algorithm a fact and not a guideline. College administrators are changing how they conduct academic business or oversee the educational aspects and institution’s culture.” Attendees gathered at the Mid-America Regional Council (MARC) offices, where senior researcher Jeff Pinkerton talked about the use of data to help city agencies and other entities anticipate fluctuations in population, employment and transit, among other issues. “Our computer model said only 7.3 of you would be here tonight. But I see 14, so we’ll have to go back and calibrate the formula,” Pinkerton joked. He said MARC doesn’t use mathematical models as they are depicted in “Weapons of Math Destruction.” “We don’t really use such algorithms, but we do review the way we use our data,” he said. “We’re trying to take the real world and make numbers out of it but be cautious about how we present data and make the right decisions.” Overall, readers said, they found O’Neil’s book accessible, engaging and informative. “I loved the way she wrote about math,” Tuncten said. “And I wasn’t surprised at the way it impacts our daily lives. Data tends to make my eyes roll, but it was fun the way she wrote about data, and it was understandable.” “O’Neil gave good guidelines for what constitutes a ‘weapon of math destruction,’ ” Schneider said. “The feedback loop is not appropriately designed or is completely missing. A good algorithm that’s good is one that could be changed. A bad one won’t be changed.” Kaite Mediatore Stover is the Kansas City Public Library’s director of reader’s services.

Google Maps v9.54 prepares to add saved locations for your school and gym, notification channels, and what looks like a task list [APK Teardown] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/05/26 6:22am PDTMay 26, 2017 41 Plus 1 on G+ 69 Share on Facebook 51 Share on Twitter Total Shares161 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Article Contents 1 Teardown 1.1 Saved locations for School and Gym 1.2 The 'Other' Notification Channel 1.3 A few new prompts 1.4 A task list called "Nearby Need?" 2 Download An update to Google Maps v9.54 began rolling out to users through the beta channel yesterday, but it doesn't appear to have any visible changes going live quite yet. However, a teardown of the apk does bring a few hints about what to expect in the future. There are clues about a couple of new saved destinations like the Home and Work slots that have become so useful, the first stirring of support for Android O's notification channels, a few new "promos" to get people interested in various features, and a very curious feature that might turn out to be a task list of sorts. As usual, we've got a link at the bottom to download this update to sideload if you're not interested in waiting for Google to deliver it to your device. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. Saved locations for School and Gym If you find yourself regularly using the Home and Work saved locations for quick navigation, you'll enjoy this one. The Maps team is expanding the list to include two more common destinations: your gym and your school. <string name="GYM_LOCATION">Gym</string> <string name="SCHOOL_LOCATION">School</string> Since those two strings don't really include any specific telltale signs that they're intended to be default saved locations, I've included the two previously existing lines for Home and Work for comparison. It's pretty obvious that the naming convention matches up. <string name="HOME_LOCATION">Home</string> <string name="WORK_LOCATION">Work</string> There is also a newly added icon for education, which I would naturally assume will go with the School destination. There doesn't appear to be a similar icon dedicated to the Gym slot, but it's not as if Google can't easily color-fill the existing fitness icon. Nevertheless, this one missing icon might be a hint that Google won't make these new destination slots available until a future update includes the missing icon. These two new entries will obviously operate just like Home and Work for the purposes of navigation and quick route selection. And as always, users don't have to actually link these slots to real schools or gyms. I'm sure a lot of people will welcome this simple improvement because so many of us travel to more than just work and home in a typical day. The 'Other' Notification Channel I'll just make a quick mention of this topic since it's not really that interesting. Google Maps is going to have a notification channel on Android O titled "Other notifications." <string name="OTHER_NOTIFICATION_CHANNEL">Other notifications</string> I doubt this will be the only custom channel for Maps. After all, there are several subsections in Settings dedicated to each notification type, so we'll probably see the channel list grow a fair amount in the future. I would assume the Maps team is still trying to decide how to best organize the app's notifications. This "other" channel will probably become a placeholder for most of the notifications until they are organized into suitable channels. A few new prompts I normally skip changes that are meant to advertise existing features, but sometimes the focus of banners and notifications can give a little insight into the features and apps that may not be performing as well as expected or simply need user awareness. The latest Maps update includes three new promos. The first banner is for the Google Trips app. Launched around this time last year, Trips is basically an itinerary management app that's also intended for making local recommendations. Trips probably doesn't have a very substantial user base yet, so it's not hard to imagine why Google is trying to breathe a little more life into it. code <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_TITLE">Take your travel info with you</string> <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_TITLE_WITH_AREA_NAME">Take your %1$s travel info with you</string> <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_BODY">Reservations • Things to do • Day plans</string> <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_DOWNLOAD_LINK">Get Google Trips app</string> <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_DISMISS_LINK">No thanks</string> The next addition is intended to get users to try out the recently launched location sharing feature. It's pretty normal to show prompts to get users only newly released features, so there's nothing unusual about this one, but you can probably expect to see it in your navigation setup soon. code <string name="CAR_TI TLE_JOURNEY_SHARING">Share journey</string> <string name="JOURNEY_SHARING_PENDING_PROMPT_TEXT">Share your trip with %1$s</string> <string name="JOURNEY_SHARING_PENDING_PROMPT_TTS">Sharing your real-time location with %1$s until you arrive.</string> <string name="CAR_MENU_START_JOURNEY_SHARING">Share journey</string> <string name="CAR_MENU_STOP_JOURNEY_SHARING">Stop sharing</string> The final promotional banner will belong to the always familiar Local Guides program. As usual, it's going to encourage users to contribute to Maps for points. The one interesting oddity is that these strings have "v2" in their names. It's possible this just means they are for a new set of promos, or this might hint at a revised version of the points program. I would expect the former, but it's at least worth acknowledging the latter is possible. code <string name="POINTS_V2_PROMO_TITLE">Reach new Local Guides levels</string> <string name="POINTS_V2_PROMO_TEXT">Now earn more points for your reviews, photos, edits, and adding new places.</string> <string name="POINTS_V2_PROMO_GOTO_STATS">SEE YOUR LEVEL</string> <string name="POINTS_V2_PROMO_OPEN_HELP">Learn more</string> A task list called "Nearby Need?" There's very little to go on for this topic, but it looks just weird enough that I suspect there's a feature brewing in there somewhere. A pair of new layouts were added with the name "nearby need," one of which defines the look of a list, and the other is for items in that list. There is also a single string with a related name and just the word "navigate" for text. <string name="NEARBY_NEED_NAVIGATE">Navigate</string> /layout/nearby_need_item.xml /layout/nearby_need.xml Based on this very limited amount of information, it does sound a little like a shopping list of sorts. Perhaps less like a grocery list and more like a list of chores or tasks – e.g. getting new tires on the car, picking up some materials for a weekend project, and buying new clothes. I would assume each item goes into a list and Google Maps will make it easy to navigate to the next nearest place where each of these things can be taken care of. I'm not actually sure if these are related, but there are also three new images to be found in the resources, and they certainly would fit with my theory. The first is for creating new tasks, the second is for completed tasks, and the final one is for "old" completed tasks. I suppose the old one might be for things a user did on previous days but hasn't removed from the list. This is all guesswork right now, but many people have been asking for ways to use Maps to get through chores, and this feels like the first hint of something like that. The one aspect that's not yet hinted at, but I certainly hope to see, is a feature that will sort tasks efficiently so people can choose the shortest (or fastest) route to get everything done. I'll keep watching and follow up when there are more developments.

They are used when you go to Your Contributions -> Check the Facts/Uncover Missing info. I think after all this time those two are still only for lvl 5 local guides... so yeah. Cody Toombs Right, the look of the images aren't new, but the files containing those images are. Or said more clearly, there are now multiple copies of those icons. mmark27 I sure would like there to be a "Work" and then a "Parking for Work" section for those that don't park right next to their office. Point being, if I want walking direction/estimations, give them from my office. If I want driving directions/estimations on time, know that I have to walk to my car, then drive from my parking location. The School addition will be good to finally have pop up automatically now though. Cody Toombs If you're not going to use all four slots for their intended purpose, you might just assign one of the others to be your work parking. Frankly, I would have liked these saved slots to have custom labels, since some people don't fit into this one shape. For example, I know somebody that has to travel to two different sites for the same job, and another friend that was enrolled in two different schools at the same time. It's not like one of these destinations can't go into the "Gym" slot, but it would be nice if the titles could make sense. mmark27 Right. I now have my "Work" location saved as my parking lot, which is silly, but it's the only way to get decent estimations. Your fix is what I'll be doing otherwise unless they fix it. The subtly though in this situation is El Goog knowing that the Work and Work Parking are linked existentially, so they can decipher where my body is and estimate from there, etc. Same can be said for Home and Home Parking if not directly on site. Would seem like Google's apartment-city-dwelling-first mentality would be more amenable to this off the bat. I agree that we should be able to have free labels on places and also as many places as we can stomach estimations/notifications on time to. Google knows where I am at all times....make it actually useful, guys. henleyb I work from home and Google would keep asking me to set my work address which is of course the same as my home address, it was a small but annoying thing. :) Cody Toombs I hated that for years. I've been working from home in one capacity or another for more than a decade and it took far too long to see Maps lighten up on having a different Work address. Austin Spangrud Sure would be nice if maps got integrated assistant into it. None of the commands and home commands that I have integrate with the Voice button in maps. Oh and In b4 where's my speed limit pop up Cody Toombs Speed limits are still limited geographically. Since I was in the Bay Area last week, I finally saw them pop up for the first time on my phone and in Android Auto. Funny enough, I now have a Speed Limit toggle in settings on one phone, but nowhere else :/ And now I'm probably not going to see the speed limits again for a long time. Paul_Werner Yeah and we used to have them and they disappeared. At least it did for me here in the Milwaukee, WI area. Same for when I travel to Chicago Nicholas Matranga Finally, it was so annoying to have to save my school address as my work address just to get commute updates. mike shwilly Grow up Maxr1998 Had to do the same, I'm very glad they implement this option now that I will have finished school in less then a month... (And haven't visited it for anything except a few exam-days since late April..) Hamilton Jimenez Vasquez Finally, Im glad that we can save more pinned-saved choices other than the usual Home and Work, although I would prefer to customize them on my own in the same manner we customize the saved list. I could make a really good use of few in my mind like Church, Work2, University, etc. Jon Xuereb Couldn't you use this school one for University Hamilton Jimenez Vasquez I used the word University just an example, the point is that it would be great to customize those pinned saves using our own creations. Taylor Hardy I work from comfort and ease of my property or home, through doing easy gigs that only takes from you a Computer and web connection and I am also joyful than before... After six months time in this project and also i got made in sum 36,000 usd... Basically I make near 80 bucks/hr and work for three to four hours every day.And excellent point relating to this work is that you can easily handle time and effort while you work and for how long as you prefer and you generate a paycheck per week........ learn by clicking here how to do it right now Paul_Werner I can't wait to see that "nearby need" implemented. Your guesswork on it sounds like it could be a really useful feature. h4rr4r Why are these static names? Why can't I add random strings and assign them saved locations? Ken Vincent what ever happened to speed limits? I thought that was on the verge of being a thing more then a year ago. UKTK8 "In the coming weeks" Meaning whenever Google d#$% well pleases. Jon Xuereb Lawyers I'm assuming dmo580 Yet Waze and other GPS apps have no issues. How about just displaying my current speed? Ken Vincent Not only that, but google provides speed limits as a service. I would imagine that is where Waze gets their speed limit info. https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/roads/speed-limits Jon Xuereb Because Google Maps is exponentially larger in terms of user base, and google is a bigger target for lawsuits Ken Vincent Waze is wholly owned by Google. They are not even an Alphabet company, they are Google. Jon Xuereb Still the size of the userbase affects the their risk assessment icyhotmike why not just let us add "Saved" locations such as Home and Work and whatever else we want? Damn Google in control of everything. makapav My God the Google apps and ecosystem are becoming such a clusterfuck with no sources of truth for data points. All the information is spread across random places. Richard Oldroyd I do use home a lot but for the others like gym I save as a contact and nav just as quick. Richard Oldroyd I'd love maps to display my current speed and advise what the speed limit is. Obviously they would have to add a warning saying they can not be held responsible for displaying an incorrect speed limit. I'd also like to see us be able to choose what is displayed underneath where they show destination time and miles to go, it would be useful to see arrival times at all stops not just the one you are currently naving to. Sathiya Moorthy Karan Really usefull information Regards, Sathiya Moorthy K developeit.net Jason List/Task ?? Why does Google keep messing with reminders/task ? Just create a dedicated reminders/task app already and move on. I hate that my reminders are spread out all over the place. Inbox, Calendar, Assistant, Keep. Get it together Google.

Skip to content 512 Pixels About Projects Membership Sponsor RSS → Thinking About Shared iCloud Photo Libraries  May 26, 2017May 28, 2017 ⌘ Permalink I had a very rocky experience with iCloud Photo Library in late 2015: I imported my photos and uploaded my 70GB photo library to iCloud. Everything went very smoothly, so I turned on iCloud Photo Library on my iPad. Aaaaaand it all exploded. Apple Support eventually got me up and running, but it took a while for me to fully trust the system. The reality is that iCloud Photo Library is pretty great when everything is working smoothly.1 Photos show up on my devices quickly, regardless if I snapped them with my iPhone or imported them from an SD card on my iMac. My wife has been using it for as long as I have, and she also enjoys the service. We’re both paying iCloud customers at this point, but like every other family using iCloud Photo Library, our sharing system is a bit of a mess. If I take photos on my “nice camera,” I’ll import the RAW files to my iMac, edit them, then import them into both of our libraries. If either of have an iPhone photo we want to share, we AirDrop it, as Shared Photo Streams downsize images and video: iCloud Photo Sharing supports JPEG, RAW, PNG, GIF, TIFF, and MP4, as well as special formats you capture with your iPhone, like slo-mo, time-lapse, 4K videos, and Live Photos. You can even share your Memory videos. When shared, photos taken with standard point-and-shoot cameras, SLR cameras, or iOS devices have up to 2048 pixels on the long edge. Panoramic photos can be up to 5400 pixels wide. iCloud Photo Sharing supports both MP4 and QuickTime video file types, and H.264 and MPEG-4 Video file formats. Videos can be up to five minutes in length and are delivered at up to 720p resolution. All of this leads to a lot of duplication between our libraries. Google recently introduced powerful new sharing tools, and as the guys on ATP spoke about this week, its time Apple step up to the plate with something new. Here’s Jason Snell on the subject: My wife and I have wanted to pool our photo libraries for ages now—the alternative is for me to occasionally plug her iPhone into my Mac and import her photos, and for her to ask me to AirDrop photos I’ve taken to her when she wants to post them to Facebook. Google Photos will allow that now—and Apple needs to follow suit. But, you’re saying to yourself, what if you want to share some but not all photos with a partner? Google’s announcement takes this extra step, letting you specify that certain sorts of photos—for example, photos of specific people—be shared, while others aren’t. While offering an all-or-nothing library sharing feature would be nice, it’s even better if sharing can have some granularity. Google’s headed there now. Will Apple follow? In thinking about how Apple could add family sharing to iCloud Photo Library, two types of solutions come to mind. Common Library In this world, Apple would have a way to have multiple iCloud accounts have access to one big, centralized common photo library. Users — let’s say a married couple — could both go in, create albums, make edits and more. Both people would have full read/write access to the library. There are issues with this, of course. Would individuals have their own iCloud Photo Libraries and access to the big shared one? How would Photos.app display this? I think this sort of thing could be confusing, and I bet people would end up with photos in the wrong library pretty easily. If users didn’t have their own personal libraries, I think many would be frustrated and sharing every single photo and screenshot they take. In short, I don’t think a big, shared library is the way to go. Library Access This solution is what I would prefer. In it, my wife and I would continue to have our own libraries, tied to our own iCloud accounts, just like we do today. However, we would be able to add each other as viewers to our libraries. Once access has been granted, her library would show up in the top-level of Photos.app as do things like People, Places, Videos, etc. I could tap her library to see all of her content, including albums, collections, etc. If I were to see something I wanted to add to my library, I could select it and tap “Add to My Library.” Doing so would prompt iCloud to add a full-resolution copy of that file to my personal library. In this world, she would not be able to edit anything in my library, but pull any content from it she wants in hers. This would not take care of the duplication issue, but would be less confusing than having one big library. WWDC is Coming Last year, Photos.app and iCloud Photo Library saw a lot of love, but Apple needs to keep its foot on the gas to stay competitive in this space. I hope they do just that on June 5. It’s still not perfect; I recently had a whole bunch of photos adopt the same description.

holiday Internet of ThingsCognitive Computing Back to Home Why I’ve Become an AI Optimist Increase / Decrease text size By Aaron Rosland, Counsellor (Commercial – Ontario), High Commission of Canada James Nunns 26th May 2017 Add to favorites If, like me, you prefer the man plus machine scenario, then grab a place at the table. There are seats – but they’re filling up fast. There’s much to fear about our AI future. For a start, we face a future where many believe the only path forward is man versus machine. In this scenario humans are replaced by machines that think for themselves. This is the future depicted in films like Ex Machina and Her. Aaron Rosland, Counsellor (Commercial – Ontario), High Commission of Canada It is also a future we’re told will gobble up as many as 7 million jobs in the next five years. In fact, if we’re to believe the latest World Economic Forum data, 65 per cent of children entering primary school today will be working in jobs that don’t currently exist. For young people, it is a daunting prospect. Edelman’s latest Trust Barometer data found that nearly 6 in 10 young people are worried they won’t have the right skills to build careers in a more automated world. The future looks bleak in this scenario. But more and more, we are seeing a future where man plus machine is becoming a way of life; where everything in our daily lives from healthcare to banking can be augmented. It’s the future where thousands of new jobs are made not eliminated, a future where AI is additive; contributing as much as £654 a year to the Exchequer, according to the latest Accenture figures. It’s the future being written right now in Ontario, Canada. Two weeks ago, Britain’s own Geoff Hinton, the godfather of deep learning, unveiled the Vector Institute – a nearly $200m (CAD) institute located in Toronto, Ontario, whose raison d’être is to identify new business models for AI so that it can support and sustain economic growth. Digital pioneering runs deep in the Hinton family. He is the great-great-grandson of George Boole, whose “Boolean algebra” has become a bedrock of digital computing. A computer scientist at the University of Toronto, Hinton has been working on deep learning since the 1970s. He’s responsible for developing many of the AI techniques that allow machines to learn tasks by analysing large amounts of data. In fact, many of his students have gone on to become principal architects in the field today, swelling the ranks of Google, Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft. Vector is Hinton and others’ attempt to make Toronto the AI capital of the world. It’s an ambitious move, but Ontario’s tech industry is growing, and the province is fast becoming a leader in artificial intelligence. It doesn’t take long to tally up Ontario, and Canada’s AI successes thus far. Technologies found in Facebook’s facial recognition algorithms, Google’s Photos app, smartphone voice recognition and even Japanese robots were all developed in Canadian research labs. Meanwhile fledgling ideas are getting equal weighting. Take the example of Facebook executive, Steve Irvine, who recently made the decision to leave Silicon Valley for Toronto to start a company, Integrate.ai, focused on applied artificial intelligence. Part of the secret to Canada’s success is their public-private partnership models. Vector itself is a collaboration between the University of Toronto, the governments of Ontario and Canada, and a mix of private partners including Google, Accenture, and all five of Canada’s big banks. The model, which focuses on integrating AI into Canada’s economic future, is an effort to bridge the gap between university research and companies like Google to help commercialise research and connect companies with top talent. It’s this pool of talent that Silicon Valley has been fighting over for quite a few years. University of Toronto professor, Ajay Agrawal, noted a little over a year ago, that Canada was at risk of losing its top talent to the US. Vector is one way of reversing the brain drain. Ontario’s universities are already among the best in the world, but Vector will help those universities recruit and retain scientific talent and train hundreds of graduate students, and expand our reach with the next generation of AI entrepreneurs. Finally, and this is where I have a role to play as the Commercial Counselor for Ontario in the UK, is helping to market Ontario internationally as both a source and a destination for AI. In an economy prized for resource extraction, AI is the new frontier. Few outside of the research community realise Ontario’s credentials in producing some of the world’s top AI talent, but more importantly the opening of the Vector Institute is an opportunity to show people that we’re more than a training ground, we’ve become a destination, and a world-leading one at that, for commercialisation. The province is already home to nearly 200 AI-enabled companies, with many more to follow. AI is pushing boundaries and breaking new ground every day. That can frighten us, or we can choose to embrace it and be empowered by the new potential for our businesses and ultimately our daily lives. If, like me, you prefer the man plus machine scenario, then grab a place at the table. There are seats – but they’re filling up fast.

Bob Goodlatte (center), the leader of the House Judiciary Committee Alex Wong / Getty Facebook, Google, Microsoft and a host of tech companies asked Congress on Friday to reform a government surveillance program that allows the National Security Agency to collect emails and other digital communications of foreigners outside the United States. The requests came in the form of a letter to Republican Rep. Bob Goodlatte, a Virginia lawmaker who’s overseeing the debate in the House of Representatives to reauthorize a program, known as Section 702, which will expire at the end of the year without action by Capitol Hill. In their note, the tech companies asked lawmakers for a number of changes to the law particularly to ensure that Americans’ data isn’t swept up in the fray. Meanwhile, they endorsed the need for new transparency measures, including the ability to share with their customers more information about the government surveillance requests they receive. Signing the note are companies like Airbnb, Amazon, Cisco, Dropbox, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Lyft, Microsoft and Uber. Absent, however, is Apple, which previously has joined with its tech counterparts in pushing for limits in government surveillance programs. A spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday. Section 702 is one of a number of U.S. surveillance authorities that had been the subject of great scrutiny and debate in the aftermath of Edward Snowden’s surveillance leaks. The disclosures have also caused years of heartburn for Silicon Valley, which has faced an onslaught of criticism from international customers who feel the tech industry is too close to the U.S. government. Many top tech companies even banded together in a lobbying group that pushed for surveillance reforms in 2013. As the fight over the NSA’s powers returns to Congress, however, the Trump administration has urged lawmakers to keep Section 702 in its exact, current form. Earlier this month, the NSA on its own terminated a piece of its program that essentially allowed the agency to collect Americans’ emails and texts if those communications contained key words related to foreigners that already are targeted for government surveillance. To that end, the tech companies writing Congress today said Congress should formally outlaw that practice, known as “about” collection, as part of its new legislation, to ensure it can’t come back. Otherwise, the government’s Section 702 program isn’t supposed to target Americans. But their communications still are lapped up in the bunch, sometimes incidentally, including cases in which an American is communicating directly with a non-U.S. person who is the subject of NSA scrutiny. Despite calls from the likes of Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., the agency has never disclosed the total number of Americans affected by such a program. In response, the tech industry asked Congress to put in place “judicial oversight for government queries” for U.S. citizens’ data. And they asked House lawmakers to rethink other portions of the law to “reduce the likelihood of collecting information about non-U.S. persons who are not suspected of wrongdoing.” Subscribe to the Recode newsletter Sign up for our Recode Daily newsletter to get the top tech and business news stories delivered to your inbox.

Facebook Here’s Why Facebook Is Helping Google and Apple With Instant Articles Mathew Ingram May 26, 2017 If there's one thing you can usually count on with Facebook, it's that any new feature it introduces will be designed primarily to benefit Facebook—in most cases to get users to spend more time inside the company's walled garden. That's why an announcement Facebook made on Thursday is unusual. The company said it would open the technology behind its mobile-focused Instant Articles feature so that it works with similar competing services offered by Google and Apple. With one step, publishers will now be able to use a Facebook software tool to produce articles that fit the Facebook Instant Articles standard, and also comply with Google's competing AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages) standard, Support for the Apple News format is coming soon, the company said. This doesn't mean Google or Apple will get any more access to Facebook's platform than they would have before. But it does represent a kind of truce in the mobile news war, and in that sense it is a tacit admission of failure. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. By supporting Google and Apple's technologies, Facebook is essentially admitting that Instant Articles by itself wasn't enough to entice publishers. For the past two years or so, ever since it launched Instant Articles as a limited trial with partners like the New York Times (and Time Inc., which owns Fortune), the social network has been trying to get media companies to adopt it. In a nutshell, the feature takes articles that have been formatted for the web and strips them down to make them load more quickly in a mobile browser. Initially, this was an appealing idea for many publishers, which either didn't have the financial resources or the skills to make their stories load faster in mobile browsers. But at the same time, it was a problematic deal in many ways. Facebook offered anyone who participated in the program 70% of the revenue from ads that Facebook was able to sell, or 100% of the revenue from ads they sold themselves. But this revenue didn't exactly start pouring in. The company made a number of tweaks to try and improve the situation, but it didn't really move the needle for many media companies, especially since one of the main ways Facebook sped up the loading of pages was by blocking certain types of ads. In addition to that, some publishers were leery of giving Facebook even more control over their content. The giant social network already accounts for a huge amount of the traffic that many media outlets get from the web, and uses its algorithm to control who sees their content and when. Some, like the Washington Post, jumped in with both feet, but others—including Bloomberg, the Wall Street Journal, and ESPN—balked. Even the New York Times, a launch partner, eventually stopped participating in Instant Articles, and so did The Guardian (which also pulled out of Apple News). In part, that's because both papers were focusing on their digital subscriptions and membership programs, and Instant Articles wasn't really helping. Many publishers seem to be more interested in Google's AMP standard, which is more open than Facebook's. Although the search giant is in charge of the technology, it is an open-source project that makes its code public and theoretically allows anyone to take part in developing it. There are still concerns on the part of some media companies that Google has too much control over AMP, and that it is interested primarily in promoting its own advertising networks and technologies, but AMP still seems to have gotten more uptake than Instant Articles. It also supports subscriptions and paywalls, which Instant Articles doesn't. Apple News, meanwhile, got off to a slow start, with many publishers seeing extremely low traffic from articles they formatted for the service. But more recently there is evidence that some sites are seeing improved traffic from their Apple News articles. Apple also recently hired a managing editor for Apple News, a position that didn't exist before, which suggests that it might be looking to beef up the service and possibly even expand it.

At Google I/O 2017, a number of new features were announced for Photos, including suggested sharing based on who's in a certain photo. But for that to work, Google needs to figure out who is who, and now the Photos web app is asking users to identify what they look like. Upon visiting photos.google.com, you may be welcomed by the above screen. Google already uses machine learning wizardry to match faces to people, so all you have to do is select which face is yours. Once you do that, you'll be able to search for "me" in the Photos search to find pictures of yourself. According to a recent teardown, this option should appear at some point in the Photos app as well, but it didn't for me. Presumably, this will be far more useful once the other features announced at Google I/O show up. Let us know in the comments if you have received the pop-up.

John Doe I did but for some reason it shows a photo of me from over 6 years ago even though I have plenty of recent photos LoL Corbin Davenport Yep, my picture was an awful photo of me from several years ago. John Doe I was able to change it by going to people then clicking on the picture and even when you choose a picture with a lot of people in it figures out which one is you and zooms in...creepy bozzykid It doesn't matter what photo you choose of yourself. The rest are all linked to you anyways. This isn't replacing your profile pic. John Doe No but some photos it has not figured out its me or at least when I click on me it doesn't show all the pictures of me but it is good enough to find pictures of me when I was a child which is crazy because I changed a lot. Stakoman Is this US only? would be great if you guys made a "how to enable face recognition google photos" post Suicide_Note Use a US VPN to start using the face recognition. Once you get things setup, you can stop using the VPN, though face recognition should still work. rndusrnm479461 You can use a VPN (get tunnelbear cause it's free) for Android, then clear cache, open photos and enable grouping of faces in the settings. Then you can disable VPN. I did this about a year ago and I've had it ever since without any problem both on Android and on the web. bozzykid I believe it uses one of the firsts photos you have stored. It has already linked the rest to you anyways. Régis Knechtel Not always, apparently, cause it used a recent photo for me. I think it's random. Brendapdaniels Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Corbin Davenport On the web, go to Settings -> Group similar faces, and there should be an option to pick your face. Yatin No, I'm from India Drakenoid Yes, I'm also from India. Naga Sridhar I am from India too, but are you in India? myssi Pop-up recieved, I'm from Pakistan. Tomáš Petrík And I guess we will be left out in the EU, again :/ Indefinite Implosion I'm in NL and got it a few days ago? A day or two after the announcement maybe (crunch time, so days are a blur). I didn't tip because it doesn't do anything right now so hardly seems worthy of a post. roberto.elena Do you already have "group similar faces" activated? If yes, then you will get this update. Tomáš Petrík No, it is disabled for accounts registered in the EU due to some stupid privacy ruling of the EU. roberto.elena I know, but you can activate it using a VPN (or at least that was possible when they launched Google Photos). Once it's activated, you don't need the VPN anymore, and you get all updates related to face recognition features. Nelson Not correct. I'm in Europe and by using Opera VPN plus Google Photos cache clear the feature appeared Amir Instead of copying and pasting your Debbie Downer response on every single comment, go try it with a VPN. Gosh! Tomáš Petrík I don't know who Debbie Downer is and I posted a similar response only due to the fact that I want to react to multiple people and I want them all to get a notification so that they know somebody replied to their post. Suicide_Note Use a US VPN and you can join the party. Tomáš Petrík It's not about VPN this time. Accounts registered in the EU have facial recognition disabled due to some stupid privacy ruling of the EU. Jens Törnblad That's why you activate the feature with a VPN. Suicide_Note Ah, okay. I wasn't aware of that. Definitely sucks. Mr K Nope. I cleaned data from Google Photos and force closed, activated Tunnelbear (it's free for 500MB but you won't use more than 50) in the US and opened Photos. Configured everything (make sure face recognition" is activated in settings) and everything works fine. I just got the notification in Photos for web about this new feature. And you can of course uninstall the VPN when everything is set up. rndusrnm479461 Get tunnelbear for Android. Choose a US vpn. Clear Google Photos cache -> open it -> enable grouping of faces in the settings. You only have to do this once. I did it a year ago and it has worked ever since on all my devices. Tomáš Petrík It's not about VPN this time, though. Accounts registered in the EU have facial recognition disabled due to some stupid privacy ruling of the EU. rndusrnm479461 Really? I registered mine in EU in ~2008 and activated face grouping in early 2016 without problems. henleyb I got it a day or two ago. Was an old photo but searching for 'me' did bring up correct photos for me so that's something.

Who Do You Trust More With Your Safety: Google or Ford? By Doug Newcomb May 26, 2017 10 Comments A new survey from Inrix notes that carmakers have advantages—for now—in the race to win over consumers with autonomous technology. A decade ago, it would have been unimaginable that a tech company like Google could successfully challenge automakers, that Tesla would be worth more than Ford, or that ridesharing firms would be major players in personal transportation. Fully autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to massively disrupt the car industry, but who will win the hearts and minds of consumers and the inevitable self-driving car war: Automakers, tech giants, or ridesharing companies? It's "a new battleground," according to Bob Pishue, a senior economist at Inrix. US Trusts Tech In a recent survey, Inrix polled about 5,000 people from five countries who purchased a new vehicle in the last four years. Respondents were asked who they trust most to build an AV: traditional automakers (e.g. BMW and General Motors); established tech giants (e.g. Apple and Google); newer carmakers (e.g. Tesla and Fisker Motors); ridesharing companies (e.g. Uber and Lyft); or trust all equally or none of the above. The level of trust varied by region. For example, respondents in the US were slightly more trusting in tech powerhouses like Google and Apple than automakers to build AVs (27 percent vs. 23 percent, respectively). This outlook shifts significantly in Germany, where nearly three times as many respondents trust traditional car makers most to build AVs. Interestingly, in all the countries surveyed (France, Italy, and the UK were also included), fewer than 4 percent of respondents had confidence that ridesharing companies will get robo-rides right. Despite Americans' marginally higher faith in tech providers over automakers, the survey found that car companies have a distinct advantage in several respects. "With unknown and potentially unproven technology such as autonomous driving, consumers may default strongly to trusted brands such as the traditional car manufacturers," Inrix said. "It will be important for car manufacturers to demonstrate that they can develop successful high-tech products," Inrix argued. My cynical side says good luck with that, since automakers have had a difficult time successfully integrating smartphone interfaces into cars, allowing Apple CarPlay and Google Android Auto to gain traction. Related Taking Cadillac's Tech-Heavy CT6 Plug-In Hybrid for a Spin Taking Cadillac's Tech-Heavy CT6 Plug-In Hybrid for a Spin But building a smartphone interface—or a smartphone—is nowhere near as complex as manufacturing a car, and this is where tech companies could falter and consumer confidence could waver. "A problem that new entrants like Google, Apple, Uber, and Lyft may face in convincing consumers to purchase or use AVs they manufacture is that they have no experience or familiarity of these brands in this space." As car owners become more familiar with semi-autonomous driving technologies such as Volvo's Pilot Assist, it could also help automakers keep consumers in the fold in a future of autonomous driving. The survey also says that "familiarity with these emerging technologies and their benefits will be central to winning customers, especially early adopters of AVs." While it's inconceivable that some automakers could be sidelined within a decade, history hasn't been kind to incumbents in the tech space and is littered with once prominent, pioneering brands such as Kodak, Atari, and Palm. Car companies at least have a potential head start in the AV race. Back to top Previous : The Return of Arcade Sports Titles Makes Video Games Great A...

With hundreds of competing brands, industry standards, and manufacturer apps, managing everything is akin to a full-time job. However, if you’re invested in the Google ecosystem of products, there’s some good news: you can use one app to control all of your products and settings. Better yet? It’ll even work with plenty of non-Google products. The app is Google Home. Not to be confused with the speaker of the same name Google Home Review Google Home Review Google Home is a personal assistant smart speaker, and comes from a company that literally knows everything. The $130 Google device answers questions, controls your smart home, and plays music. Should you buy one? Read More  and Google Assistant, the Google Home app used to be called Google Cast. But what exactly does the Google Home app integrate with? What features does it offer? And is it really the one-size-fits-all solution you’ve been waiting for? Keep reading to find out. Which Devices and Services Are Supported? The Google Home app works with any device, app, or service that also integrates with the Google Home smart speaker. It’s a long list, but the services and products can broadly be divided into three sections: audio, video, and smart home. Advertisement Audio — YouTube Music, Google Play Music, Spotify, TuneIn Radio, Pandora, Deezer. Video — YouTube, Netflix, Hulu, Google Play Movies, Google Chromecast. Smart Home Devices — Google Home speaker, Nest, Phillips Hue, Samsung SmartThings, Honeywell, Belkin Wemo, TP-Link, IFTTT. (More on these later.) You can use the app on both Android and iOS. Let’s take a detailed look at how to use the app. Download — Google Home app for Android Download — Google Home app for iOS The Tabs When you load the Google Home app, you will see three tabs along the top of the screen. They are Watch, Listen, and Discover. The tabs are primarily used for casting content around your home. Watch The Watch tab allows you to find any video content on apps you already have installed on your device. Along the top of the window, you’ll see links for the compatible apps. Scroll down, and you’ll see popular TV shows 12 TV Shows to Download Off Netflix for Your Commute to Work 12 TV Shows to Download Off Netflix for Your Commute to Work Netflix now lets you download content to watch offline, but what TV shows are actually worth downloading? We have found 12 TV shows perfect for commutes of any length. Read More and movies you can stream straight to your Chromecast, Android TV, or Chromecast-enabled smart TV. Just tap the show/movie you want, and it’ll start playing automatically. You don’t need to navigate to the individual service’s app. At the bottom of the page, you’ll see a Browse link. Click it, and you’ll be able to find other video services that Google Home supports. Listen The Listen tab functions in the same way as the Watch tab. You’ll see links for apps you’ve already installed, suggested content, and a way to find more compatible apps. Both Listen and Watch have a search icon in the bottom right-hand corner. This is a universal search feature, letting you instantly browse all your connected services without hopping between apps. It works extremely well on mainstream apps like Netflix 10 Niche Streaming Services for Those Who Hate Netflix 10 Niche Streaming Services for Those Who Hate Netflix Mainstream streaming services carry mainstream content.

For example, perhaps you’ll be offered discounts on a movie rental through Google Play Movies or your see special promotions for some of Google’s physical hardware. Note: You might not see all the tabs. It depends on which devices are on your network. See the image below for confirmation of which tabs you can expect. Google Home The app really starts to shine if you connect it to a Google Home smart speaker (and by extension, Google Assistant). It serves as a suggestion screen and dashboard for everything related to the speaker. The speaker itself introduces a host of features: Get reminders. Get traffic alerts and commute information.

To set up these features and manage, head to Menu > More settings > My Day. You’ll see a list of checkboxes for each available feature. Tick the ones you’d like to synchronize with your app and speaker. Connecting Third-Party Devices Google Home app is also a useful hub for other smart devices in your home. Supported third-party devices can be broken down into three sub-categories: smart lights, smart thermostats Finding the Best Smart Thermostat for Your Home Finding the Best Smart Thermostat for Your Home Looking for a good smart thermostat for your home? Keep in mind that some are smarter than others! Take a look -- one of these options may be your solution! Read More , and smart plugs. Here are the supported manufacturers for each category: Lights — Philips Hue, SmartThings, Wink, TP-Link, LIFX, Osram, Lowes Iris, Lutron Caseta, Emberlight, iDevices, Universal Devices, MobiLinc. Thermostats — Nest, SmartThings, Honeywell, Wink. Plugs — SmartThings, Wink, Belkin Wemo, TP-Link, Best Buy Insignia, Lowes Iris, Lutron Caseta, iHome, Leviton, Artik Cloud, iDevices, NuBryte, Universal Devices, MobiLinc. For all the devices, you need to do the initial set-up using the manufacturer-supplied apps and portals. You can only link them to the Google Home app once you’ve verified they are all working correctly. To link devices to the app, go to Menu > Home control > Devices and tap the + icon. Choose the name of the manufacturer whose products you want to connect, then follow the on-screen instructions. You can assign each device to a specific room, place it in a new room, or give it a nickname. Once you’ve got everything connected, you can issue voice commands using your smart speaker or with the Google Assistant on your mobile device. Using IFTTT If your preferred action doesn’t have a pre-existing voice command, you can create your own using IFTTT 10 of the Best IFTTT Recipes for Smart Home Automation 10 of the Best IFTTT Recipes for Smart Home Automation The right IFTTT recipes for your smart home can save you time, effort, and energy. Here are ten of our favorites to get you started. Read More . The commands aren’t part of the Google Home app, but they’re part of the same process and are worth mentioning briefly. Download the IFTTT app (Android or iOS), search for Google Assistant, and click Connect. Next, tap your username and go to New Applet > This and search for Google Assistant. Choose your Trigger and enter up to three ways to say your phrase. Finally, go to New Applet > This and choose your Action service. You will find your new applet in the My Applets menu at the top of the IFTTT home screen. It’s Early Days The Google Home app is undeniably extremely powerful. It’s a vital app to have if you’re running lots of the supported devices around you home. But it’s also unwieldy to use. It feels like Google is trying to cram too much into it, resulting in confusing and complicated in-app navigation. The issue is symptomatic of the app’s roots in Google Cast. It doesn’t feel logical to have the casting content and smart home management content under the same umbrella. Alas, it’s early days. The rebranding from Google Cast to Google Home only happened in late-2016 and it seems Google is still wrestling with the best way to move forward. It’s certain to improve as time passes. Do you use the Google Home app? What are its strong points? Where does it fall flat? Let us know your thoughts and opinions in the comments below.

In other words, the one cool thing that Google Home Devices have that Amazon Devices don't is a half-baked feature only works with some subset of products with Google Home branding. In fact, other than a Chromecast, I haven't seen that feature work at all. Reply Dan Price 419 articles Dan is a British expat living in Mexico.

Long Beach, Calif.-based DynamicPoint is describing the release as a “significant milestone.” The release includes a SharePoint Add-In that can be deployed in either SharePoint on-premises or Online, which makes it easier to use Dynamics 365, AX and CRM. According to Kiril Genov, the product architect, with this new version users can publish any information from Dynamics 365, AX, GP, NAV and CRM in a SharePoint portal. For enterprise workers, this means easier document, data and information sharing and management around things like sales orders, customer contacts, or any other information stored in Dynamics 365, AX and CRM. DynamicPoint customers also have the option to add on capabilities which allow users to make edits and flow them directly back into Microsoft Dynamics. Third-party suppliers and partners continue to push out complements to the Microsoft portfolio, even as the company has made strides under the leadership of Satya Nadella to close gaps in its offerings.  SharePoint Customer, Vendor and Employee Portal v2.0 is a good example of this and if it works as the company claims, it is definitely worth a look. Microsoft Moves Into Africa Also this week, Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft announced new expansion plans. With the increased demand for its Office 365 and Azure services, the company is looking for ways to expand its cloud infrastructure. Microsoft recently claimed that Office 365 has 100 million commercial users while Azure is snapping at the heels of both Amazon Web Services and Google. With that in mind, it announced it will open two data centers in South Africa — in Johannesburg and Cape Town — with initial availability in 2018. In a statement, Scott Guthrie, executive vice president, Cloud and Enterprise Group said it will offer Azure, Office 365 and Dynamics 365 to enterprises from these centers and will also guarantee data residency for companies concerned about compliance. “Few places in the world are as dynamic and diverse as Africa today. In this landscape, we see enormous opportunity for the cloud to accelerate innovation, support people across the continent who are working to transform their businesses, explore new entrepreneurship opportunities and help solve some of the world’s hardest problems,” Gutherie wrote. With the two new centers, Microsoft will have 40 cloud regions globally and will give it an entry point into a continent that is still relatively underdeveloped in terms of enterprise computing. It has beaten both Google and Amazon to the punch here. Neither company has set up a presence in Africa yet, though AWS is present in 16 regions encompassing 42 zones globally, while Google has eight regions with plans to expand before the end of the year. Google Unveils New Gif Maker Meanwhile, Mountain View, Calif.-based Google unveiled a Data GIF Maker which allows creation of data visualizations based on any two sets of data.  Google News Lab developed the new Data GIF Maker. For the moment it is a very basic offering that can be used to compare stats about different sets of information as that information evolves. Simon Rogers, data editor at the Google News Lab explained in a blog post: “Data visualizations are an essential storytelling tool in journalism, and though they are often intricate, they don’t have to be complex. In fact, with the growth of mobile devices as a primary method of consuming news, data visualizations can be simple images formatted for the device they appear on.” The tool is available for anyone to use. And judging from a quick search of the Google Keyword site they do offer some useful graphics. “We typically use the tool to represent competing search interest, but it can show whatever you want it to — polling numbers, sales figures, movie ratings,” the blog post continued. This is not Google Data Studio ‘Lite’ (Google Data Studio turns data into easy to read and share dashboards and reports) but it's interesting move and in the hands of Google, could go a long way. PandaDoc Raises $15 Million Finally this week, San Francisco-based PandaDoc announced it raised $15 million in Series B funding led by Rembrandt Ventures Partners, with participation from Microsoft Ventures, HubSpot, EBRD and Altos Ventures. PandaDoc develops an all-in-one platform that supports document creation around sales activity, including quotes, proposals and contracts. A newcomer to the enterprise documents space, PandaDoc was founded in 2013 and set itself the target of helping organizations, “close more deals.” On its website it claims to have been instrumental in closing $16 billion worth of deals. To do that it developed a suite of tools that includes document templates, editing, document tracking and e-signature smarts, as well as offering integrations with the likes of Salesforce. In 2015 it raised $5 million in a funding round by Altos Ventures with additional participation from TMT Investments and other unnamed investors. 0 Comments Top Articles Related Articles Recent Comments What Drove Acquia's Leadership Change?

Google Maps v9.54 prepares to add saved locations for your school and gym, notification channels, and what looks like a task list [APK Teardown] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/05/26 6:22am PDTMay 26, 2017 41 Plus 1 on G+ 69 Share on Facebook 51 Share on Twitter Total Shares161 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Article Contents 1 Teardown 1.1 Saved locations for School and Gym 1.2 The 'Other' Notification Channel 1.3 A few new prompts 1.4 A task list called "Nearby Need?" 2 Download An update to Google Maps v9.54 began rolling out to users through the beta channel yesterday, but it doesn't appear to have any visible changes going live quite yet. However, a teardown of the apk does bring a few hints about what to expect in the future. There are clues about a couple of new saved destinations like the Home and Work slots that have become so useful, the first stirring of support for Android O's notification channels, a few new "promos" to get people interested in various features, and a very curious feature that might turn out to be a task list of sorts. As usual, we've got a link at the bottom to download this update to sideload if you're not interested in waiting for Google to deliver it to your device. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. Saved locations for School and Gym If you find yourself regularly using the Home and Work saved locations for quick navigation, you'll enjoy this one. The Maps team is expanding the list to include two more common destinations: your gym and your school. <string name="GYM_LOCATION">Gym</string> <string name="SCHOOL_LOCATION">School</string> Since those two strings don't really include any specific telltale signs that they're intended to be default saved locations, I've included the two previously existing lines for Home and Work for comparison. It's pretty obvious that the naming convention matches up. <string name="HOME_LOCATION">Home</string> <string name="WORK_LOCATION">Work</string> There is also a newly added icon for education, which I would naturally assume will go with the School destination. There doesn't appear to be a similar icon dedicated to the Gym slot, but it's not as if Google can't easily color-fill the existing fitness icon. Nevertheless, this one missing icon might be a hint that Google won't make these new destination slots available until a future update includes the missing icon. These two new entries will obviously operate just like Home and Work for the purposes of navigation and quick route selection. And as always, users don't have to actually link these slots to real schools or gyms. I'm sure a lot of people will welcome this simple improvement because so many of us travel to more than just work and home in a typical day. The 'Other' Notification Channel I'll just make a quick mention of this topic since it's not really that interesting. Google Maps is going to have a notification channel on Android O titled "Other notifications." <string name="OTHER_NOTIFICATION_CHANNEL">Other notifications</string> I doubt this will be the only custom channel for Maps. After all, there are several subsections in Settings dedicated to each notification type, so we'll probably see the channel list grow a fair amount in the future. I would assume the Maps team is still trying to decide how to best organize the app's notifications. This "other" channel will probably become a placeholder for most of the notifications until they are organized into suitable channels. A few new prompts I normally skip changes that are meant to advertise existing features, but sometimes the focus of banners and notifications can give a little insight into the features and apps that may not be performing as well as expected or simply need user awareness. The latest Maps update includes three new promos. The first banner is for the Google Trips app. Launched around this time last year, Trips is basically an itinerary management app that's also intended for making local recommendations. Trips probably doesn't have a very substantial user base yet, so it's not hard to imagine why Google is trying to breathe a little more life into it. code <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_TITLE">Take your travel info with you</string> <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_TITLE_WITH_AREA_NAME">Take your %1$s travel info with you</string> <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_BODY">Reservations • Things to do • Day plans</string> <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_DOWNLOAD_LINK">Get Google Trips app</string> <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_DISMISS_LINK">No thanks</string> The next addition is intended to get users to try out the recently launched location sharing feature. It's pretty normal to show prompts to get users only newly released features, so there's nothing unusual about this one, but you can probably expect to see it in your navigation setup soon. code <string name="CAR_TI TLE_JOURNEY_SHARING">Share journey</string> <string name="JOURNEY_SHARING_PENDING_PROMPT_TEXT">Share your trip with %1$s</string> <string name="JOURNEY_SHARING_PENDING_PROMPT_TTS">Sharing your real-time location with %1$s until you arrive.</string> <string name="CAR_MENU_START_JOURNEY_SHARING">Share journey</string> <string name="CAR_MENU_STOP_JOURNEY_SHARING">Stop sharing</string> The final promotional banner will belong to the always familiar Local Guides program. As usual, it's going to encourage users to contribute to Maps for points. The one interesting oddity is that these strings have "v2" in their names. It's possible this just means they are for a new set of promos, or this might hint at a revised version of the points program. I would expect the former, but it's at least worth acknowledging the latter is possible. code <string name="POINTS_V2_PROMO_TITLE">Reach new Local Guides levels</string> <string name="POINTS_V2_PROMO_TEXT">Now earn more points for your reviews, photos, edits, and adding new places.</string> <string name="POINTS_V2_PROMO_GOTO_STATS">SEE YOUR LEVEL</string> <string name="POINTS_V2_PROMO_OPEN_HELP">Learn more</string> A task list called "Nearby Need?" There's very little to go on for this topic, but it looks just weird enough that I suspect there's a feature brewing in there somewhere. A pair of new layouts were added with the name "nearby need," one of which defines the look of a list, and the other is for items in that list. There is also a single string with a related name and just the word "navigate" for text. <string name="NEARBY_NEED_NAVIGATE">Navigate</string> /layout/nearby_need_item.xml /layout/nearby_need.xml Based on this very limited amount of information, it does sound a little like a shopping list of sorts. Perhaps less like a grocery list and more like a list of chores or tasks – e.g. getting new tires on the car, picking up some materials for a weekend project, and buying new clothes. I would assume each item goes into a list and Google Maps will make it easy to navigate to the next nearest place where each of these things can be taken care of. I'm not actually sure if these are related, but there are also three new images to be found in the resources, and they certainly would fit with my theory. The first is for creating new tasks, the second is for completed tasks, and the final one is for "old" completed tasks. I suppose the old one might be for things a user did on previous days but hasn't removed from the list. This is all guesswork right now, but many people have been asking for ways to use Maps to get through chores, and this feels like the first hint of something like that. The one aspect that's not yet hinted at, but I certainly hope to see, is a feature that will sort tasks efficiently so people can choose the shortest (or fastest) route to get everything done. I'll keep watching and follow up when there are more developments. Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way. Rather than wait for Google to push this download to your devices, which can take days, download and install it just like any other APK.

They are used when you go to Your Contributions -> Check the Facts/Uncover Missing info. I think after all this time those two are still only for lvl 5 local guides... so yeah. Cody Toombs Right, the look of the images aren't new, but the files containing those images are. Or said more clearly, there are now multiple copies of those icons. mmark27 I sure would like there to be a "Work" and then a "Parking for Work" section for those that don't park right next to their office. Point being, if I want walking direction/estimations, give them from my office. If I want driving directions/estimations on time, know that I have to walk to my car, then drive from my parking location. The School addition will be good to finally have pop up automatically now though. Cody Toombs If you're not going to use all four slots for their intended purpose, you might just assign one of the others to be your work parking. Frankly, I would have liked these saved slots to have custom labels, since some people don't fit into this one shape. For example, I know somebody that has to travel to two different sites for the same job, and another friend that was enrolled in two different schools at the same time. It's not like one of these destinations can't go into the "Gym" slot, but it would be nice if the titles could make sense. mmark27 Right. I now have my "Work" location saved as my parking lot, which is silly, but it's the only way to get decent estimations. Your fix is what I'll be doing otherwise unless they fix it. The subtly though in this situation is El Goog knowing that the Work and Work Parking are linked existentially, so they can decipher where my body is and estimate from there, etc. Same can be said for Home and Home Parking if not directly on site. Would seem like Google's apartment-city-dwelling-first mentality would be more amenable to this off the bat. I agree that we should be able to have free labels on places and also as many places as we can stomach estimations/notifications on time to. Google knows where I am at all times....make it actually useful, guys. henleyb I work from home and Google would keep asking me to set my work address which is of course the same as my home address, it was a small but annoying thing. :) Cody Toombs I hated that for years. I've been working from home in one capacity or another for more than a decade and it took far too long to see Maps lighten up on having a different Work address. Austin Spangrud Sure would be nice if maps got integrated assistant into it. None of the commands and home commands that I have integrate with the Voice button in maps. Oh and In b4 where's my speed limit pop up Cody Toombs Speed limits are still limited geographically. Since I was in the Bay Area last week, I finally saw them pop up for the first time on my phone and in Android Auto. Funny enough, I now have a Speed Limit toggle in settings on one phone, but nowhere else :/ And now I'm probably not going to see the speed limits again for a long time. Paul_Werner Yeah and we used to have them and they disappeared. At least it did for me here in the Milwaukee, WI area. Same for when I travel to Chicago Nicholas Matranga Finally, it was so annoying to have to save my school address as my work address just to get commute updates. mike shwilly Grow up Maxr1998 Had to do the same, I'm very glad they implement this option now that I will have finished school in less then a month... (And haven't visited it for anything except a few exam-days since late April..) Hamilton Jimenez Vasquez Finally, Im glad that we can save more pinned-saved choices other than the usual Home and Work, although I would prefer to customize them on my own in the same manner we customize the saved list. I could make a really good use of few in my mind like Church, Work2, University, etc. Jon Xuereb Couldn't you use this school one for University Hamilton Jimenez Vasquez I used the word University just an example, the point is that it would be great to customize those pinned saves using our own creations. Taylor Hardy I work from comfort and ease of my property or home, through doing easy gigs that only takes from you a Computer and web connection and I am also joyful than before... After six months time in this project and also i got made in sum 36,000 usd... Basically I make near 80 bucks/hr and work for three to four hours every day.And excellent point relating to this work is that you can easily handle time and effort while you work and for how long as you prefer and you generate a paycheck per week........ learn by clicking here how to do it right now Paul_Werner I can't wait to see that "nearby need" implemented. Your guesswork on it sounds like it could be a really useful feature. h4rr4r Why are these static names? Why can't I add random strings and assign them saved locations? Ken Vincent what ever happened to speed limits? I thought that was on the verge of being a thing more then a year ago. UKTK8 "In the coming weeks" Meaning whenever Google d#$% well pleases. Jon Xuereb Lawyers I'm assuming dmo580 Yet Waze and other GPS apps have no issues. How about just displaying my current speed? Ken Vincent Not only that, but google provides speed limits as a service. I would imagine that is where Waze gets their speed limit info. https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/roads/speed-limits Jon Xuereb Because Google Maps is exponentially larger in terms of user base, and google is a bigger target for lawsuits Ken Vincent Waze is wholly owned by Google. They are not even an Alphabet company, they are Google. Jon Xuereb Still the size of the userbase affects the their risk assessment icyhotmike why not just let us add "Saved" locations such as Home and Work and whatever else we want? Damn Google in control of everything. makapav My God the Google apps and ecosystem are becoming such a clusterfuck with no sources of truth for data points. All the information is spread across random places. Richard Oldroyd I do use home a lot but for the others like gym I save as a contact and nav just as quick. Richard Oldroyd I'd love maps to display my current speed and advise what the speed limit is. Obviously they would have to add a warning saying they can not be held responsible for displaying an incorrect speed limit. I'd also like to see us be able to choose what is displayed underneath where they show destination time and miles to go, it would be useful to see arrival times at all stops not just the one you are currently naving to. Sathiya Moorthy Karan Really usefull information Regards, Sathiya Moorthy K developeit.net Jason List/Task ?? Why does Google keep messing with reminders/task ?

The latest version of its OS for wearable devices was already months behind schedule, after Google said in September that its release would be delayed until early 2017. By mid-April, many devices still hadn't received the update, but Google insisted that all remaining devices awaiting the upgrade would get it by the end of May, including the Moto 360 2nd Gen. Yesterday, Motorola tweeted that Android Wear 2.0 will roll out "in phases" to that device, "possibly as early as today". @NamelessWing @Moto Happy to report that AndroidWear 2.0 will start rolling out in phases on Moto 360 2nd Gen, possibly as early as today. — Motorola Support (@Moto_Support) May 25, 2017 It's not clear if any Moto 360 2nd Gen devices have actually received the update yet, but it seems that the wait is finally coming to an end. That said, Motorola hasn't provided any indication of when it expects the rollout to be completed, so it could still be days - or even weeks - before all of those devices are upgraded. The Moto 360 Sport was also on the list of devices that Google said would be upgraded by the end of May. However, it looks like those plans have slipped again - in a further tweet, Motorola confirmed that Android Wear 2.0 is still coming to the Moto 360 Sport, but added: "...we have no timing to share." @jfemoreau Moto 360 Sport will get 2.0 but we have no timing to share. - Daisy — Motorola Support (@Moto_Support) May 25, 2017 Meanwhile, ASUS announced last week that it had begun its Android Wear 2.0 rollout for the ZenWatch 3, but later said that it was "mistaken", and that it was aiming to start its rollout later this month.
