 Google secretly bought a small mobile app development startup last year Ken Yeung, VentureBeat Aug. 18, 2016, 6:40 PM 2,666 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apportable cofounders Collin Jackson (left) and Ian Fischer (right). Apportable Google secretly acquired the team at mobile app development startup Apportable more than a year ago, VentureBeat has learned. Terms of the deal have not been disclosed, but multiple sources said that it was an acqui-hire. Founded in 2011 by former Coolisis consultant Collin Jackson and former Webroot software engineer Ian Fischer to enable developers to allow iOS apps to run on Android devices without extensive changes to their code, Apportable is believed to have been purchased in March 2015. Sources indicate that not everyone was kept on after the deal closed, but Jackson and Fisher were retained and are now software engineers at Google, having officially joined in May 2015. Interestingly, it’s a bit of a homecoming for Jackson as he previous was a software engineering intern at the Mountain View, Calif.-based company. Jackson and Fisher are joined at Google by 11 members of Apportable’s engineering team, while the rest of the 65 employees have been let go. Even though it’s considered to be an acqui-hire, Apportable still remains operational, albeit with a skeleton crew. Following Jackson and Fisher’s relocation, Google installed Apportable software engineer Jim Terry as chief executive. Sources say that the proverbial lights are being kept on as there are some clients that still using Apportable’s technology. Google declined to comment. Although it’s now owned by Google, this isn’t the first time the two companies have worked together. As a mobile app development platform, Apportable needed to have a relationship with Google, and even received funding from that company’s early-stage venture firm GV. But this doesn’t seem to have been a great ending for Apportable, as sources shared that there were some financial difficulties at the company. Apportable has offered three products: an eponymous flagship service targeting enterprises, the open-source SpriteBuilder aimed at games, and Tengu which was formerly known as Apportable Indie and allowed developers to reuse Swift and Objective-C code without compromising on the native user interface. Many of these products have become casualties of the deal with Tengu seemingly taken offline — the site displays an error message. SpriteBuilder’s site remains online, but the app no longer is available at least in the Mac App Store in the U.S. Its SpriteBuilder store has an expired security certificate — it’s been outdated since January 2016 — and the blog has also not been updated since then. As for Apportable’s enterprise offering, if you try to access more details, it displays a programmatic error saying that it can’t find the right “template” to display. Further proof of Apportable’s change in ownership include the fact its contact page has also been taken offline and its office no longer exists — the current tenant is smart lock maker August. Jackson once described playing “Angry Birds” as his inspiration for Apportable, saying he was “frustrated that I couldn’t play it on my Android device, despite it having been released on iOS for 10 months. I started emailing top game developers and asking why they were all iOS exclusive, and found out that in most cases they wanted to support Android, but porting was slow and expensive.” It’s unclear about what Google is building with the Apportable team, but it’s likely that the company will produce more tools to encourage developers to not have to be forced to choose which operating system they should first build their app on. This could accelerate growth in the Android ecosystem, driving more development so more productivity, entertainment, gaming, and social apps are supported by your smartphone. Google may also be using the technology and team to build out its Fuchsia operating system. This wouldn’t be the first time Google has done deals to bring in tools that Android developers need. Last month, it acquired LaunchKit to add the mobile app development suite of products to its Developer Product Group, which contains resources around leveraging Google account log in, analytics, messaging, storage and sync, app testing, monetization, payments, gaming, maps, and monitoring performance. Let’s also not forget about the acquisition of Firebase to build better real-time apps and Agawi which powers streaming native mobile apps. The move could also be viewed as an effort by Google to stay one step ahead of its competitors, especially around making it easier for iOS apps to be supported on other platforms. Microsoft, earlier this year, acquired mobile app development company Xamarin to improve its developer tools and services. However, the Redmond, Wash.-based company killed off its Project Astoria initiative earlier this year, an effort to port Android apps to Windows 10 — basically creating universal apps. Instead, Microsoft shared that it would be focusing efforts on enabling conversion of iOS apps to Windows 10 devices, including Xbox and PCs. Apportable had previously raised $7.4 million in venture funding from investors ACE & Company, Betaworks, Eastlink Capital, Danhua Capital, GV, Salesforce Ventures, Y Combinator, and Alexis Ohanian.

Xooglers A gathering spot for ex-Googlers to reminisce and comment on the latest developments in search. Wednesday, March 16, 2011 Brilliant! Love it! Now, could you change it all around? Final installment of the Dilbert logo saga, revised and reposted from the Xooglers archive. ******************* The script Scott sent us for the Dilbert Google doodle seemed to pick up nicely on Sergey’s suggestion. In the first panel, the pointy-haired boss (PHB) sits next to the regular Google logo and says to his staff, "We need a new logo by Friday. Any ideas?" The next day, the “G" and "O” at the front of the logo are screened back so that they appear much paler than the last four letters. Dilbert says, "We could drop the first two letters." The PHB answers, "That's a no go idea." On day three, the last three letters are faded back and Dilbert says, "We could shorten the logo to three letters." The Boss says, "No, Goo isn't sticky." Those three panels were easily approved and became part of the final doodle published on the site. What didn’t make the cut were the fourth panel, in which Wally says, "The logo needs more sex appeal. I'll show you..." and the fifth panel, featuring Wally standing in front of the "OO" part of the logo as if the O’s are, as Scott put it, “his gigantic man-breasts,” while Dilbert says, "I find this disturbing." There is something inherently amusing in the notion of man-breasts. As someone whose own sense of humor runs to Mel Brooks and Dave Barry, I wasn’t terribly offended by the concept, but I suspected others would be. I was right. After sending it around to other Googlers, questions were raised about how it would play internationally, the use of the word “sex,” and the appearance of breasts (male or female) on our signature page. Interestingly, but not surprisingly, none of those objections came from Sergey, who found the concept pretty funny and opined that we shouldn’t be afraid to take a few risks. The irony of acting like one of the clueless companies Dilbert lampoons was not lost on him. I’d like to say that I fought for the concept and damned the shortsighted, small-minded philistines who couldn’t see the greatness inherent in Scott’s original idea. I’d like to say that, but then I would be lying. Frankly, I was relieved that I wasn’t the only one nervous about where Scott was taking us. I would find it amusing to see this in his strip, but not on our branded homepage, which we were showing to millions of people around the globe. They hadn’t come to Google expecting to see slightly risqué humor. They’d come to find information. My sensitivity to the subjectiveness of humor wasn't always as finely attuned. On more than one occasion in my career, what I had thought was funny had turned out to be less than amusing to others. I made fun of bagpiping neighbors in a radio spot for the Mercury News that brought the wrath of a lunatic Celtic rights advocate raining down upon me. I wrote a newspaper ad headline for KQED FM that said “Ed Meese is history” during the station’s broadcast of live coverage of the Senate Iran Contra hearings. The station president didn’t buy my argument that it referred to the fact that Meese’s testimony had ended the day before and we were now covering the next witness. He seemed pretty peeved when I kept trying to persuade him to run it anyway. And while at an ad agency, I pissed off the descendants of California’s most famous gold miner with an ad for a business school claiming that “When John Sutter found gold, he lost a fortune. He could have used an MBA from USF.” The editor of the San Francisco Chronicle sent a personal complaint to my boss at the Mercury News during a newspaper war for subscribers after the close of a smaller local paper. He felt my flyer pointing out that there were only two Peninsula-related stories in their paper compared to the Merc’s two dozen was hitting below the belt. He seemed particularly ticked over the line, “Yesterday the Chronicle gave you two bits for your 35 cents.” And then there was the time I wanted to promote the depth of news stories in the Mercury News online archive. I browsed hundreds of stories and came up with a piece reviewing the food at local company cafeterias, including Silicon Graphics. Turns out they had served rabbit once, so I stuck a drawing of a bunny in an ad that made reference to the menu. The next morning, PETA started picketing SGI’s headquarters. After a series of snafus in the newspaper’s composing room led to the ad running twice more after I had promised the publisher it wouldn’t, I got to write a personal letter of apology to SGI’s CEO and barely held onto my job. (Ironically, I was to eat many meals in that very cafeteria when Google took over SGI's headquarters). So, let’s say I wasn’t all that anxious to step out on the bleeding edge of comedy again. The upshot was that I had to go back to Scott and ask him to remove the man-breasts. He wasn’t all that happy about it, but consummate professional that he is, he was back within the hour with a modified version. In this one, Dogbert says, "The logo needs more sex appeal. I'll show you..." The next day, Dogbert peers through the "OO" part of the logo as if they’re his glasses. Dilbert says, "I find this disturbing." The “sex” set off alarm bells again for one senior manager, which led Sergey to start making noises about going back to the original idea. I volunteered to go back to Scott yet again and ask for a third version. I really didn’t want to do it, because it’s never fun to tell a creative person working for free that their idea just isn’t good enough. (I’d done that at a previous job when a world-renowned ad agency wrote some pro-bono ads for me that were way out of my comfort zone). I walked a very fine line with Scott. I told him how funny the first idea was and that we were sorry that it wasn’t appropriate for our audience. I told him the second idea was fine, but not as funny as the first, which was our fault for bringing a corporate mentality to the project. I gently asked if he’d be willing to go to phase three. He said he’d sleep on it. In the morning, he sent us the version that actually ran. He also asked that he be allowed to run the rejected ideas on his website, which was fine with me, though I’m not sure he actually posted more than a description of the man-breast idea. Of course, everyone loved the new idea and I was once again the hero, not the goat. Well, to everyone except my boss, who didn’t think it was all that funny, even in it’s third version. And then we posted the first day’s strip. The Googlers-misc mailing list began humming like Zappa’s dynamo. Our internal only mailing list called Googlers-misc was the place for anyone at Google to share their thoughts on any activity in which the company was engaged. There had already been an active thread proposing a homepage tribute to a soon-to-be-released science fiction movie popular with geeks of all ages when Dilbert put in his first appearance. That thread quickly became focused on the dark side of our Dilbert logo and the great disturbance it was creating among our users. Or at least, the users who happened to have friends working at Google. The concerns varied from the fear that we were seriously planning to change our logo forever to the sense that we had sold out the homepage to promote a blatantly commercial enterprise. And the avatar of that latter evil, the cool hard ceramic proof point of that, was, yes, you guessed it: the mug. I won’t bore you with the details of the disdain Googlers heaped upon the Google-Dilbert mug and their concerns about the message it was sending to our loyal users, but suffice it to say that it was heartfelt, voluminous and incapable of being ignored. Google was still a relatively small company at this point and any time more than three Googlers were unhappy about something, it required a response. CNET made things worse by running a story that included the line, “Part of the fun in business is making money, of course: Google plans to sell T-shirts with the Dilbert logo, as well as coffee mugs." The t-shirt reference was untrue and was eventually corrected, but the damage was done. It cast the whole initiative as a profit-driven grab for cash. So I went to Sergey with the suggestion supported by many staffers that we give the proceeds for the mug sale to charity, which we would make clear on the site. He agreed and suggested something related to cancer research. And that’s why I placed a call to the American Cancer Society to let them know we’d be sending them a check for more than $11,000. As for the mugs, they’re no longer available since it was to be a limited time offer. I have one, as do 400 other Googlers to whom we gave them during TGIF. I took that to mean that at least some Googlers didn’t object to seeing Dilbert adorning our logo. In the aftermath, we were approached by many artists, cartoonists and brand managers, who felt the door was now opened to promoting their products on what was becoming one of the web’s most popular homepages. We turned them all down, because we now had empirical evidence that any commercialization or even perceived commercialization of the homepage logo would be detrimental to the brand we were building. What did I take away from this whole experience? Four things: Brand managers are not always the people closest to the true nature of the brand, nor the best able to see what might be construed as damaging to its integrity. Having free-flowing, unregulated communication within a company can be distracting, annoying and damaging to one’s ego, but it lets you know pretty quickly when you’ve stepped across a line you shouldn’t have crossed. Expect that there will be unexpected ramifications from even the most innocuous seeming initiatives. That shouldn’t stop you from moving ahead, but you should be ready to respond to the weirdness and be flexible about the ways in which you do it. Cartoons should never be written by a committee. A postscript (2006): I watched Google launch its recent Da Vinci Code puzzle promotion with interest. I think it was handled well and avoided the dreaded Dilbert effect by making the promotion opt-in and tying it to a specific Google service (homepage personalization). The challenge also fit Google’s branding strategy of promoting puzzle solving and smart thinking, which is tied to both the brand value and Google’s recruitment efforts (more on that another time). They didn’t change the homepage logo and they didn’t sell mugs. I’d be surprised if they didn’t get some mail about tying to a controversial story that’s banned in some parts of the world, but that’s one of those eggs you have to break if you’re going to make an omelet. With millions of users, someone’s always going to be pissed off about something. I hope there was a Googlers-misc thread about whether the promotion marked a sellout to corporate interests and the death knell of the old Google, but that kind of debate is probably a relic of Google’s past. Still, an unmoderated discussion about core-values among 6,000 plus bright, opinionated, articulate individuals would likely be highly entertaining, as long as you’re not Google’s new brand and entertainment manager Dylan Casey. Dylan, I feel your pain. Posted by Doug at 8:54 PM Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest 2 comments: Mike Pascale said...

By John Gruber Archive The Talk Show Projects Contact Colophon RSS Feed Twitter Sponsorship Uber to Begin Testing Self-Driving Cars in Pittsburgh Thursday, 18 August 2016 Max Chafkin, reporting for Bloomberg: Near the end of 2014, Uber co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick flew to Pittsburgh on a mission: to hire dozens of the world’s experts in autonomous vehicles. The city is home to Carnegie Mellon University’s robotics department, which has produced many of the biggest names in the newly hot field. That’s a bit of a whitewashing. What happened is that Uber approached Carnegie Mellon to create a “strategic partnership”. Uber’s strategy, it turned out, was to identify CMU’s best engineers and hire them away. As I wrote at the time, their “partnership” was like that between a fox and a henhouse. The goal: to replace Uber’s more than 1 million human drivers with robot drivers — as quickly as possible. The plan seemed audacious, even reckless. And according to most analysts, true self-driving cars are years or decades away. Kalanick begs to differ. “We are going commercial,” he says in an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek. “This can’t just be about science.” Jobs that can be performed by machines eventually will be performed by machines. That’s been the steady march of progress since the dawn of the industrial revolution. But it really is extraordinary for a CEO to flatly declare that he considers the company’s workforce not to be an asset, but rather a stopgap measure he’s committed to eliminate. Say what you want about the politics of his bluntness, but he certainly deserves points for honesty. Starting later this month, Uber will allow customers in downtown Pittsburgh to summon self-driving cars from their phones, crossing an important milestone that no automotive or technology company has yet achieved. Google, widely regarded as the leader in the field, has been testing its fleet for several years, and Tesla Motors offers Autopilot, essentially a souped-up cruise control that drives the car on the highway. Earlier this week, Ford announced plans for an autonomous ride-sharing service. But none of these companies has yet brought a self-driving car-sharing service to market. Google has certainly generated a lot of publicity regarding its self-driving vehicle efforts, but I am not convinced they’re the “leader in the field”. For one thing, Google’s cars only go 25 MPH. I’ve ridden in a self-driving Mercedes S-class sedan. Not only did it travel at highway speeds, but it didn’t have any obtrusive cameras or sensors. It looked like a regular Mercedes sedan — except for the fact that it had “S 500 Intelligent Drive” painted in large letters on the side of the car. The engineers I spoke with at Mercedes were adamant that even now, while the technology is still in development and years away from production, the cars need to look beautiful. Any sensors that make the car look silly are out of the question. Perhaps Mercedes is too rooted in tradition in this regard. The first automobiles really did look like “horseless carriages”. Perhaps we’ll soon adapt to self-driving cars equipped with telltale obtrusive sensors. But right now, Mercedes has prototypes on the road that are remarkably close to full autonomy, yet don’t look any different. If Mercedes is correct that customers (or at least Mercedes customers) won’t want to buy self-driving cars that look ungainly, they have a significant leg up on competitors whose sensor arrays protrude. The technology isn’t everything — design matters. Update: If you disagree — if you think the outward appearance of a self-driving car doesn’t matter, only the comfort and amenities of the interior — I think you’re being shortsighted. If all self-driving cars are ungainly-looking, they’ll still sell. Uber is already buying ungainly-looking self-driving cars. But what happens when a company starts selling good-looking self-driving cars? Cars are status symbols — even cars you don’t own. What else explains the existence of black town cars? A lot of people used to argue that the exterior design of personal computers didn’t matter, either — only the functionality. No one argues that anymore. For now, Uber’s test cars travel with safety drivers, as common sense and the law dictate. These professionally trained engineers sit with their fingertips on the wheel, ready to take control if the car encounters an unexpected obstacle. A co-pilot, in the front passenger seat, takes notes on a laptop, and everything that happens is recorded by cameras inside and outside the car so that any glitches can be ironed out. Each car is also equipped with a tablet computer in the back seat, designed to tell riders that they’re in an autonomous car and to explain what’s happening. “The goal is to wean us off of having drivers in the car, so we don’t want the public talking to our safety drivers,” Krikorian says. On a recent weekday test drive, the safety drivers were still an essential part of the experience, as Uber’s autonomous car briefly turned un-autonomous, while crossing the Allegheny River. A chime sounded, a signal to the driver to take the wheel. A second ding a few seconds later indicated that the car was back under computer control. “Bridges are really hard,” Krikorian says. “And there are like 500 bridges in Pittsburgh.” It’s easy to roll your eyes at the use of the term “self-driving” to describe a car with two employees in the front, ready to take control at a moment’s notice. But the fact that regular people will soon be taking real-world rides where no human takes any control throughout the trip is a genuine milestone. We’re on the cusp of the biggest change to the car industry, ever. Previous: Apple and the Pistol Emoji Next: Is Donald Trump Actually Trying to Win?

Ford is testing autonomous features using Fusions. It wants to put fully autonomous vehicles on the market by 2021. For the first time in America's industrial history, the center for automotive technology is drifting away from Detroit. Ford Motor Co., aiming to put fully autonomous vehicles into the economy by 2021, announced that it's doubling the size of its office in Silicon Valley to 260 people and investing in four companies that are key to building self-driving cars. The carmaker's move follows more than $1 billion in investments made by Detroit-based General Motors Co. in a pair of California technology companies earlier this year to keep up with Google's autonomous-car project and Uber Technologies Inc.'s ride-hailing business. While the old-school mechanical engineering remains in the Midwest as does low-skilled factory work that hasn't moved to Southern states, these investments show Detroit carmakers have realized that they must go to the nation's technology center to find the software expertise needed to make the autos of tomorrow. Traditional automakers now directly employ hundreds in Silicon Valley, which is also home to Palo Alto-based Tesla Motors Inc. "The shift to California is undeniable," said Eric Noble, president of the CarLab consulting firm in Orange, Calif. "The technological development for autonomous vehicles and intelligent cars will continue to be done in northern California because that's where the knowledge is." Ford and GM, racing to stay among the technology leaders, face a few tough realities. Companies like Google and Uber threaten to upend the industry by turning car owners and drivers into passengers who simply pay for a ride. And even though the carmakers and state of Michigan are developing tech talent, Silicon Valley is still ground zero for the people who write code, create driverless algorithms and come up with new business models for mobility. California's lure Ford has invested in Velodyne Lidar Inc., which develops the laser-based sensors that are the eyes of self-driving cars, and 3-D mapping company Civil Maps, both in California. The Dearborn-based carmaker also acquired SAIPS, an Israeli-based computer vision and artificial intelligence designer, and it reached a licensing agreement with Nirenberg Neuroscience LLC. Its founder, Sheila Nirenberg, has developed a machine-vision platform that Ford said can bring humanlike intelligence to self-driving cars. "We came to Silicon Valley — there are a lot of great places around the world — but the ecosystem here is just unbelievable," Ford CEO Mark Fields, standing outside on a bright, sunny day, said to reporters. "It's like a bazaar of ideas, and everybody's open." GM CEO Mary Barra last year took her top leaders to visit tech companies and venture capital firms to get their thoughts on fostering innovation. GM went on to buy a 9 percent stake in Lyft Inc., a competitor to Uber, for $500 million. GM also spent more than that to buy San Francisco-based Cruise Automation, which writes the software for autonomous driving. Owning Cruise, which has grown from 40 employees to 100, has helped GM hire people who may not have been interested in working for an automaker, Mike Ableson, GM's vice president of global product planning, said in a June interview. Some people want to remain the California environment but also have the stability of a large company, he said. Similarly, Ford's announcement may have been intended to present the maker of F-150 pickups look like an "exciting destination for human talent," Adam Jonas, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said in a research note. "There is at least a perception in the market that all the cool kids are going to places like Uber," Google, Tesla or China, he wrote. Ford and other automakers "want to change this." Michigan's story Michigan isn't giving up on talent, Gov. Rick Snyder said in a June interview. Snyder, a former chairman of Gateway computers and founder of investment funds, pointed out that Alphabet Inc.'s Google announced in May that it will open a self-driving car research center in Novi and that Harman International Industries Inc., the audio and automotive technology company, opened its North American headquarters nearby. Amazon.com Inc. has opened a tech center in downtown Detroit. Snyder said one of Michigan's biggest challenges is getting the word out that it has great resources for technology companies, especially in the automotive industry. With the University of Michigan focusing on software and technology development, the talent and education system is available for any company that wants to take advantage of it, he said. The university's Mcity provides carmakers and tech companies with an ersatz town to test driverless cars. Plus the state has much lower costs of living and doing business than California, especially with real estate prices rising ever faster in Silicon Valley. "Our challenge is that we don't do particularly well with telling people," Snyder said. "That's something we should do more of, especially when it comes to talking about Detroit's comeback." While the Detroit region has bounced back, its unemployment rate is 5.8 percent compared with 4.1 percent in the San Jose, Calif. area, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Snyder in June unveiled Planet M, an advertising and marketing campaign to tell technology companies that the state has the education and industrial base to be home to new automotive technology research and startups. The tagline is, "Michigan. Where big ideas in mobility are born." To compete with the Golden State, Michigan plans to make an autonomous-drive test track out of a 330-acre industrial site near Ypsilanti, where Rosie the Riveter built B-24 bombers during World War II.

Within weeks, the company announced Thursday, customers will be able to opt into a test program and summon an autonomous Ford Fusion. But since the technology has not been perfected, the cars will come with human backup drivers to handle any unexpected situations. Although other companies including Google are testing self-driving cars on public roads, none offers rides to regular people. As an enticement, the autonomous rides will be free, the company said. Uber employees stand by self-driving Ford Fusion hybrid cars during testing of the vehicles, Thursday, Aug. 18, 2016, in Pittsburgh. Uber said that passengers in Pittsburgh will be able to summon rides in self-driving cars with the touch of a smartphone button in the next several weeks. The high-tech ride-hailing company said that an unspecified number of autonomous Ford Fusions with human backup drivers will pick up passengers just like normal Uber vehicles. Riders will be able to opt in if they want a self-driving car, and rides will be free to those willing to do it, spokesman Matt Kallman said. (AP Photo/Jared Wickerham) Uber, which has a self-driving research lab in Pittsburgh, has no immediate plans to deploy autonomous cars in other cities. But in an interview with The Associated Press, CEO Travis Kalanick said development of the vehicles is paramount for the San Francisco company, which has grown exponentially after starting seven years ago. "We've got to be laser-focused on getting this to market, because it's not a side project for us," he said. "This is everything. This is all the marbles for Uber." Without drivers, the cost of hailing a ride will be cheaper than owning a car, changing the way we all get around, Kalanick has said. By using human backup drivers, Uber is basically testing the technology and taking people along for the ride, said Bryant Walker Smith, a University of South Carolina professor who studies self-driving technology. "Part of this is marketing in the sense that they're going to be doing continued research and development of these systems," he said. Uber also announced that it was acquiring a startup called Otto that has focused on developing self-driving big rigs and is stocked with big talent in the still-small world of self-driving technology, including Anthony Levandowski, one of the field's pioneers. Kalanick said the acquisition signals Uber's intent to get into the movement of goods and freight. In another deal, the company announced a $300 million alliance with Volvo to supply vehicles and technology. The announcements may push it ahead of its prime competitor, Lyft, which earlier this year took a $500 million investment from General Motors. Those arrangements are part of a flurry of deals between Silicon Valley tech companies, traditional automakers and ride-hailing companies as they vie for autonomous car leadership. Google has been testing self-driving cars on public roads since 2009 but has never offered large-scale rides to the public. Uber's move to haul passengers with autonomous vehicles is not surprising, given the company's history of pushing into gray areas with little or no regulation, Walker Smith said. Local laws in Pittsburgh may require a driver behind the wheel, but Pennsylvania has no laws governing autonomous cars and their role in ride-hailing, he said. He predicted that drivers will often have to intervene in Pittsburgh, with its winding, hilly roads and vast number of bridges. Each winter the city gets about 30 inches of snow, which can cover lane lines and trick autonomous car sensors that use them to help guide the ride. Use of the backup drivers is also an acknowledgement that current autonomous driving systems cannot handle the wide range of unpredictable circumstances on public roads. Timothy Carone, a Notre Dame professor who has written about the future of automation, noted that Uber is mitigating the risk with its own drivers — unlike Tesla Motors, which put semi-autonomous technology in the hands of individual customers. "This is a way to get autonomous cars out there and accepted and increase the adoption rate," Carone said. "It will take a decade of testing before an 18-year-old can get in the car and tell it where to go." Uber-branded test cars have been on Pittsburgh roads for several months. Standing at a bus stop, Anthony Fielder of the suburb of Carnegie was open to the idea. "I'd be willing to try it as long as there's a real human there to hit the brakes, you know, if the thing goes belly-up," he said. "We can only rely on technology so much or it's going to bite us." Kalanick would not speculate on when Uber might be ready to dispense with the human driver, saying that full automation can only be used now in limited places with little traffic. That's different from the relative chaos of even a small downtown, much less a big city where drivers do not always follow the rules. Carone expects Uber competitors will now accelerate self-driving tests or merger plans. He thinks they will adopt the same risk-management approach as Uber. Ford Motor Co., for example, said earlier this week that it will have a fully autonomous car with no steering wheel or pedals on the road by 2021, but it will only be used by car-sharing services and will not be sold to individuals. Though the Google car project just lost its director, Chris Urmson, it has a big head start on Uber and others. Its leaders have suggested they could launch public pilot tests of cars with no steering wheels or pedals in the next year or two. Volvo will provide Uber with SUVs for autonomous vehicle research. Eventually the SUVs will be part of the self-driving fleet in Pittsburgh. Both companies will design autonomous vehicles on their own. The real breakthrough for autonomous cars, Walker Smith said, will be when a company puts one on public roads without a backup human. For now, like a motorcycle canyon jumper with a safety net, Uber isn't ready to take the big leap. "It's probably for the best," he said. ___ Krisher reported from Detroit.

Live feed Show 7.38pm EDT 19:38 It wasn’t a pretty game, which is why the final margin was 19 points -- the closest game the U.S. has played in the Olympics. France had to make it ugly and followed that gameplan perfectly. They stayed close in the first half and won the fourth quarter, but Team USA’s huge third quarter proved the difference. Watching this game had to be both motivating and discouraging for Spain. They saw that it’s possible to play with the U.S. However, they also saw that if they have even a short letdown, they’ll get blown away. The U.S. and Spain play for gold on Saturday. Spain has never won a women’s basketball medal. The U.S. has won five consecutive golds. Thanks for following the liveblog.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.47pm EDT 18:47 Two positives for Team USA through the first half: Despite how poorly they played, they still have the lead.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.43pm EDT 18:43 Maybe the biggest surprise of the first half (outside of the score): France is leading the U.S. in field goal percentage: 41-40. Every player on the U.S. team is an offensive star, yet they’re not showing it tonight. It would be easy to pin Team USA’s struggles on Sue Bird’s absence, but it’s not like she has been replaced on the court by non-talents. France deserves credit for playing tough defense, hitting the boards hard (the bigger U.S. team has only a 22-20 advantage) and making open shots. Everyone expected a blowout. Instead, we have a four-point game with 20 minutes to play.

Point guard Olivia Epoupa leads France in scoring so far in the tournament at 10.8 ppg, only 25th best in the Games. Eight Olympic teams have at least one WNBA player on their roster. Nine, if you count Team USA’s all-WNBA roster. But France doesn’t have one. At least they’ll be unfamiliar to the U.S. That’s something.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.33pm EDT 17:33 A positive and negative for France entering this game: Team France’s 14.3 offensive rebounds per game is tied for the best mark in the Games. Team USA’s frontline towers over them and it will be tough for France to keep a rebounding advantage, but that’s one thing to watch for in this game. If France can outwork the U.S. on the boards, they could stick around. Now the negative: France is averaging 18 turnovers per game so far, one of the worst marks in the Olympics. Team USA’s offense is almost impossible to stop as it is, without giving them extra possessions and easy transition buckets. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.25pm EDT 17:25 The U.S. will likely be without star point guard Sue Bird tonight. She sprained her knee in the victory over Japan, an injury that first appeared much worse. “The hardest part is waiting and not knowing.

The U.S. women are in the position of the original 1992 men’s Dream Team: we’re not wondering if they’ll win, but by how much. So far the margins have been by 65, 40, 26, 30, 43 and then 46 in the quarterfinals against Japan. France has had a much tougher go of it to reach the quarterfinals. They went 3-2 in group play and then got by Canada, 68-63, to advance in the tournament. The U.S. beat Canada 81-51 in group play, so the French have quite a task ahead of them tonight.

However, by the second half, the US adjusted and the gap in talent proved to be too much. This US team had a second gear when things became dicey, Japan did not. This game was not the cakewalk that the 110-64 final score would suggest it was, but by the end the US team clearly showed why they’re the heavy favorites.

OPEN REFLECTIONS About Publications Presentations Projects and affiliations Inventory of Experiments A Differential Thesis CommentPress Version Wiki Version Repository Version Society of the Query – Part 2: Gugerli, Fuller, Manovich, Ludovico, Bruno and Van ’t Hof Part 1 of my notes on the Society of the Query conference can be found here. David Gugerli a historian specialized in the philosophy of science gave a lecture on the history of databases and of data management as a signifying practice. In a Deleuzian fashion, he states, knowledge operates in distributed networks. The world is a database and database management systems are shaping our world. It is a very big market (think IBM, Oracle and Microsoft)  with a high level of client lock-in where people are very dependent on their data management systems. Before however (in old databases) data was structured in a hierarchical tree-system. In this way the structure of the database determined which questions could be asked. With the coming of the search and query language every possible combination of entries could be interpreted based on recombination and relation. This meant that interpretation of data became independent of the data structure and place. These new systems were highly efficient and made for new and unexpected questions. They were also more narrative based. Gugerli compares this rise of the relational database model with the rise of critical thinking in the 60’s. Critical thinkers like Barthes, Derrida and Foucault found that a literary work could be seen as a machine that can deliver interpretations. It is a galaxy of signifiers, it has no beginning and we can gain access to it in different ways, none of which is authorative. The interpretation of the text cannot be determined by its author, the interpretations the reader produces when reading are part of its meaning. These traits can also be seen in the development of database concepts: the cultural consequences of these changes are stupendous, according to Gugerli. They do not only influence the relation between author and text but effect any form of information processing in every format. This also has big societal consequences for it has changed our information processing and caused major changes in software structure. The search society and its idea of recombination operates in real time. This requires continued change management, Gugerli concludes, a permanent fluctuation of its composition, of its practices of search and query, which shows the importance of the underlying (relational) database system. The full text of Gugerli’s talk can be downloaded here Matthew Fuller took a closer look in his talk at the alternative modalities of search and how to develop them. He states that search engines have a morphology, a scheme that generates body, they have different internal structures. Search engines can be seen as cultural machines, they connect information and knowledge. Fuller states that since the rationalization of culture is impossible, this explains the noisiness and the inaccuracy of search engines. Search engines also focus on the analysis of users and the identification of situations. This is an even more abstract process than mere personalization, where the user is not individuated but recognized as a force that produces information. As Fuller states, we need to think on the basis of populations of data producing subjects instead of on the basis of individuals. We need to focus on the dynamics and conditions of search engines. Fuller goes on to discuss different kind of search engines, in order to delve deeper into the morphology of search. Viewzi for instance adopted the aesthetics of the iPhone into a search engine, it makes maps of images and lets you see if they are linked in any way. Oamos views information search as an experience. It is not a full search engine but it uses results from a certain amount of search engines and it looks at relational information. Kartoo and Liveplasma are examples of network visualization interfaces. DAUM, NAVER (both Korean) and Directionless.info of context driven engines. With these examples Fuller gave a good overview of the multiple possibilities for search and the different possibilities for interface design. Fuller states that delving deeper into the complexities of the web and its users and reflecting this in its design is the challenge for the next wave of search. Lev Manovich’s lecture focused on how we can learn from Google. How can the search engine design serve as a new methodology for cultural analysis, or, how can we use Google as a tool for cultural analysis? First of all he stresses it is important to look at the size of our data. Most of the time cultural analysis focuses on a very small sample of cultural production, where a search engine uses every accessible web document (and now Google also indexes Twitter and Facebook) offering much larger scale for analysis of contemporary cultural production and interpretation. Secondly, when it comes to categorization, mostly cultural objects are placed into small numbers of genres/categories. A search engine can make an analysis of each web document to generate its unique description (using 200+ signals). As Manovich states, although significant research in automatic classification of web pages into genres exist, Google does not use it, because it wants to give you any page that is most relevant. Thirdly, when it concerns “links”, traditionally cultural criticism gives an analysis of a small number of selective links (“influences”) between a given object/person and others. A search engine on the other hand gives a systematic consideration of all (explicitly defined) links between a given web page and other pages. Fourthly, Manovich states that what is very important in cultural production, is that it builds on the old, on old features (characteristics, attributes, dimensions), or a small number of subjectively selected features different from text to text. A search engine focuses on lots of features and can take the interaction with the user into consideration. Where traditionally in cultural analysis theoretical work does focus on reception, in practice it gives more an analysis of documents as experienced by a critic. Web analytics on the other hand can give a good analysis of user interactions with a web site. As Manovich states, cultural analysis looks from one critique, and is thus is not empirical, as it does not look at the user interactions with cultural products. Next, when it comes to zoomability, in cultural analysis the focus is mostly on a document, a creator, group, period or paradigm with highly uneven coverage. With Google search technology or Google trends the search patterns of billions of people over a number of years can be analyzed. Think of the possibilities of Google Earth and Google Street View. As Manovich states, software developed by the digital culture industry and also by the academy often contains innovative theoretical ideas about culture which are embedded in its design (i.e. what software does to calculate the results). However this design is often used to support an outdated (i.e. 20th century) understanding of culture when it comes to search (looking for particular members of a set) or classification of culture into a small number of genres. Manovich understands the search technology as a new paradigm for cultural analysis: what if we take the principles from search engines, web analytics and Google trends (interactive visualization of patterns), and imbed them in new software tools for analysis? In this way we can extract features from each document in a set, instead of using the features to classify documents into a few classes, and we can visualize the patterns and the variability across a set. As Manovich concludes, the old search paradigm is based on knowing what you want to find, where the new search paradigm is based on finding relations. Manovich ends by asking: might Google take over the Humanities? Alessandro Ludovico and Christophe Bruno both focused on the potential search engines offer to art, by both using search engines and by reflecting upon them (in an often critical and playful manner). Ludovico discusses his project Google Will Eat Itself (GWEI), in which he established a fake website about online marketing, and subscribed to the Google AddSense program, which lets you publish Google textual adds on your web site. After opening a bank account for the project, they developed a special software which would generate an unique IP address, simulating a user, and would make automatic clicks on the adds by Google. As Ludovico explained, it would be impossible to define a fraudulent click from a true one, making it hard for Google to ban them. Ludovico sees GWEI as a conceptual artwork, as a scientific experiment. Through this project they got a lot of attention in the media. As Ludovico concluded, the worst enemy of a giant is not another giant, it is a parasite. If enough parasites would suck out enough money, it will suck the giant empty. Ludovico wants to dissect, decode and expose these giants through conceptual artworks and theories in order to create cultural anti-bodies. Christophe Bruno also discussed some of his recent artworks or Google hacks. He mentioned Ephiphanies,  a Google Poetry hack which he developed (based on Joyce’s walks in Dublin during which Joyce would collect random sentences overheard). Keywords typed into the Ephiphanies machine will collect random sentences from Google and send them back to the program to form a new poetical structure. Poet Ton van ’t Hof gave a short introduction on Flarf, a cut-up technique using Google search results, rearranging them to make a new text. As Van ‘t Hof explains, these kind of cut-up techniques are not new, as they have been used before in the 1920s by the Surrealists, and in the 50s and 60s by for instance Burroughs. As Van ‘t Hof states, its first practitioners practiced an aesthetic dedicated to ‘the exploration of the inappropriate in all its guises’. The idea behind Flarf is to mine the internet with odd search terms and then to distill them into often hilarious and sometimes disturbing poems, or plays on other texts. According to Van ‘t Hof the genre is very popular now and would not have existed without Internet or without Google. Like this: Like Loading...

Among other things, a new privacy tool will enable the more than 1 billion people who use Google's search engine and other services to block certain ads from appearing on every device that they log into, instead of having to make a special request on each individual machine. Some users of Google's search engine, Gmail and Chrome browser will start receiving notices about the new option beginning Tuesday, but it will take several more weeks before it's available to everyone. Google also is introducing a "My Activity" feature that will enable users to delete records of their online search requests and videos watched on YouTube in a single location instead of having to visit different websites or apps. Google's business has been built on its longtime practice of monitoring its users' online behaviour in an effort to learn about their interests so it can show ads most likely to appeal to them. Those customized ads shown alongside Google's search results and the content on millions of other websites have turned Google's corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., into one of the world's most profitable companies. In an effort to minimize complaints about invading people's privacy, Google has long allowed its users to impose limits on how much data is accumulated about them and how many customized ads they see. Last year, Google also opened a "My Account" hub to serve as a one-stop shop for setting privacy and security controls. If they choose, users will now be able to authorize Google to store their web browsing histories in the "My Account" centre. Until now, Google had been keeping personal information in different digital dossiers that sometimes require users to take multiple steps to manage specific pieces of data. For instance, someone annoyed by a Google-generated ad on their personal computer can prevent it from appearing again by clicking on an "X" in the corner. Taking that step currently won't block the same ad from appearing on the targeted person's smartphone a few hours later. Google says that will no longer happen if users allow it to stockpile web browsing histories in the "My Account" centre.   As Advertised in the Edmonton SUN Top stories Popular Latest Videos Liberal coal phase-out is just more magical thinking Ex-Tory MLA Sandra Jansen slams sexism, harassment, abuse in first statement since crossing floor NDP promises to cap electricity prices to protect consumers from volatility in power market Speeches by Ghomeshi’s lawyer to four universities spark debate Veteran D-man Kris Russell making a difference on Oilers blue-line Liberal coal phase-out is just more magical thinking Dalai Lama has ’no worries’ about Trump’s election Rare Anne Frank poem sells for nearly $150,000 World’s tallest waterslide where boy was allegedly decapitated to be demolished Don't think you need winter tires?

Apple's biggest move was to open up the talking iPhone assistant to third-party developers for inclusion in their apps, paving the way for users to hail a ride from Uber or send a message with Tencent's WeChat using voice commands. Experts in artificial intelligence applauded the move as an important step forward, in part because the more people use an artificial intelligence system, the better it becomes. But some wondered why Apple had not made Siri an open platform much sooner, noting that competing products including Amazon.com's Alexa, Microsoft's Cortana and the Google app are already open to developers. “Is it too little too late?” asked Oren Etzioni, who is CEO of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence and a professor at the University of Washington. “Siri is five years old and still trying to learn how to play well with others.” Artificial intelligence involves giving computers the ability to perform functions normally done by people such as speech recognition. Voice-powered digital assistants could eventually perform many tasks that currently require a smartphone app or a keyboard and a mouse, and thus they are considered a key strategic battleground for all the major tech companies. The winner of the assistant wars might able to take a cut of purchases made on its platform and also steer users toward its products and those of its allies. “This is a new platform war with huge stakes,”said Gary Morgenthaler, a venture capitalist who invested in Siri when it was a startup. “It ultimately challenges search and the market capitalization of Google.” Apple may have squandered some of its momentum. The tech giant essentially created the category by purchasing Siri, the startup behind the eponymous digital assistant, which quickly became a cultural touchstone after its release on the iPhone. As a startup, Siri worked with a variety of popular apps, but Apple cut off third-party access to the service shortly after the acquisition. Apple's move on Monday brings the assistant closer to the original vision for it, said Morgenthaler. “It's pretty sad for those of us who were part of the original team,” he said. “The rate of innovation has been less than what we would have imagined.” Technology experts have other concerns about Apple's aptitude for artificial intelligence: The company was slow to recruit talent relative to peers such as Google and Amazon, and its strict privacy stance limits data collection, which is critical for making assistants smarter. Monday's announcement did little to allay those fears, Etzioni said. “We see some policy shifts, we see some small changes, but there was no explosive announcement,” he said. But Apple took other steps to weave artificial intelligence more tightly into its operating system. The Photos app will soon study users' images to help them organize shots of favorite trips and occasions. The company said it has also made progress in determining the context of a message, helping it serve up better replies for users. “Apple is in the hunt, working hard on this,” Morgenthaler said. “They are maybe a step behind Google, but I would say they are close enough that Google is not going to leave them in the dust.” – Reuters   Most Viewed IOL Tech Sponsored Links Bulk SMS Bundles Free Budget Spreadsheet Forex Transfers: Best Rates Shop Online With Loot Join us Twitter Facebook Subscribe to newsletter Subscribe via RSS Property Business Directory <a href='http://adsfeed3.brabys.co.za/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a0fa4c9b&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE' target='_blank'><img src='http://adsfeed3.brabys.co.za/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=9&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&amp;n=a0fa4c9b&amp;ct0=INSERT_CLICKURL_HERE' border='0' alt='' /></a> <a href='http://adsfeed3.brabys.co.za/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a59f832e&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE' target='_blank'><img src='http://adsfeed3.brabys.co.za/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=4&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&amp;n=a59f832e&amp;ct0=INSERT_CLICKURL_HERE' border='0' alt='' /></a> <a href='http://adsfeed3.brabys.co.za/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a9c7fc8d&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE' target='_blank'><img src='http://adsfeed3.brabys.co.za/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=5&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&amp;n=a9c7fc8d&amp;ct0=INSERT_CLICKURL_HERE' border='0' alt='' /></a> <a href='http://adsfeed3.brabys.co.za/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a2b61fcc&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE' target='_blank'><img src='http://adsfeed3.brabys.co.za/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=6&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&amp;n=a2b61fcc&amp;ct0=INSERT_CLICKURL_HERE' border='0' alt='' /></a> <a href='http://adsfeed3.brabys.co.za/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a857db3a&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE' target='_blank'><img src='http://adsfeed3.brabys.co.za/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=7&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&amp;n=a857db3a&amp;ct0=INSERT_CLICKURL_HERE' border='0' alt='' /></a> <a href='http://adsfeed3.brabys.co.za/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a206f84d&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE' target='_blank'><img src='http://adsfeed3.brabys.co.za/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=8&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&amp;n=a206f84d&amp;ct0=INSERT_CLICKURL_HERE' border='0' alt='' /></a> You are here: IOL / SciTech / Technology / Software / Apple enhances Siri but still trails in AI We like to make your life easier RSS feeds Subscribe to one of our feeds and receive instant news.

Google hopes that it can beat out those other services with two main things: being available on every platform and offering a special feature called “Knock, knock”. Share Facebook Twitter Google Email Go To Comments That tool means that when someone is ringing, they come up on the screen before the call is answered. That lets the person being called see who’s ringing them – but it doesn’t show anything from the camera until the user actually answers the call. Some have argued that feature could prove controversial, forcing people to see inappropriate pictures, but it can be turned off. It was shown off earlier this year as part of a range of new tools – and is finally making its way to both Android and iOS. Like with FaceTime – but unlike almost every other competitor – Duo only needs a phone number to talk to someone. Most other services, including similar ones made by Google, require that both people sign up and register new usernames. Google has long offered video calling, through its Hangouts and chat apps. But it is moving Hangouts into a business-focused app, and hopes to make Duo the new way that Google users will call each other. As such, it is intended to be more simple and reliable. It will also make sure that it works well on slower connections, by using Google technology to compress video streams. Google has another mobile messaging app on the way this summer. The second will be called Allo, and is a more traditional chat app that integrates Google’s artificial intelligence to help people consult a robot during their conversations.

Duo, which was unveiled at Google's I/O developer conference in May 2016, is free to use and enables 1-to-1 video calls. It relies on your number, lets you reach people in your phone’s contacts list, offers end-to-end encryption, and has nifty features like Knock Knock, which allows you to see live video of your caller before you answer. And it's super easy to use, because the app's interface is ridiculously simple. The new app is already available in the UK version of the Google Play Store for Android devices and should also be available in Apple's App Store for iOS devices. Another part of the attraction of Duo is that Google built in the capability to stay online and connected even when you're on a slower network; the video quality is reduced "gracefully" to ensure that calls aren't disconnected. Duo is rolling out for Android and iOS now and will soon be live across the globe. If you want to know more about how it works, check out Pocket-lint's hands-on with the app, where we tell you how to get started with it, place video calls, and manage preferences, and more.

Subscribe for $59/Yr - Save $50 After New Regulations in China, What's Ahead for Baidu? Rules on Search Ads Will Hit Short-Term Revenues, but There Are Upsides By Angela Doland. Published on June 29, 2016. People walk past a Baidu Inc. logo displayed in the reception area of the company's headquarters in Beijing, China. Credit: Qilai Shen/Bloomberg Most Popular Digital advertising has exploded in China, the world's No. 2 ad market, with spending on online ads increasing five-fold in five years. Chinese search giant Baidu has been a big beneficiary of that growth. In terms of global search revenues, Baidu is second only to Google. And like Google, it's used income from search to fund ambitious projects, from driverless cars to artificial intelligence. But Baidu has hit some speed bumps lately – and its troubles are largely because of a search ad. A university student with cancer wrote a long personal story online about seeing a promoted search result on Baidu for an expensive alternative medical treatment, describing how his family borrowed money to pay for it. The student, Wei Zexi, died, and his post went viral, with some commenters accusing Baidu of sacrificing the public's health in pursuit of ad money from unreliable healthcare providers. (Healthcare ads have been a big source of revenue for Baidu.) There were repercussions. The latest was that internet regulators this weekend ordered Baidu and other Chinese search engines to provide results that are "objective, fair and authoritative;" to limit the number of search ads on a page; to make it clear when results are sponsored; and to check advertisers' qualifications. In a country with tight control over online expression, the Cyberspace Administration of China also said search engine results shouldn't run counter to the interests of the state or the public. Baidu has agreed to cooperate to "uphold a healthy Internet environment." Acting on regulators' orders, it already put into place some of the new rules weeks ago. How will the new rules affect Baidu's users, its advertisers and its revenues? Users A common user complaint about Baidu has been that people don't understand which results are organic and which are paid for. Over time, it has grown easier to tell; now paid results are shaded pink and marked with a small "promotion" tag. They're also limited in number too, to 30% of a page. Robin Li, Baidu's founder, wrote in a letter to employees last month that Baidu would prioritize user experience from now on. He promised to "reexamine the business model of every single Baidu product" from that angle. Yu Xue, senior analyst at IDC China, points out that Mr. Li also wants to improve the mechanism for user feedback and protect user rights. Mr. Xue is optimistic about the new regulations; he says the direction things are heading will be good for marketers too. Advertisers First, though, there will be some adjustments for advertisers to get used to. Prince Zhang, chief digital officer for IPG Mediabrands China, says Baidu will now have to examine the licenses and claims of ad providers in many industries, which could slow the process for getting approvals. Advertisers will have a harder time maintaining visibility, since there are fewer search ad positions available. On the other hand, the new rules mean "more opportunities in content marketing and search engine optimization," he said. "Obviously, organic search results have more chance to drive traffic now." Revenues Baidu was projected to take in 8.8% of search revenues globally last year, second only to Google, at 55%, according to eMarketer. (Google closed down its search engine in mainland China six years ago amid censorship concerns.) Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent are the key players in China's fast-growing online advertising industry, projected to hit $40.8 billion this year, according to GroupM, up from $7.7 billion five years ago. Related Stories Why China Is Fixated on Singer Lu Han (And Brands Are, Too) How Brands Are Trying to Tap Into Disney's Magic in China Inside Tencent and L'Oreal's Zany Branded Content Experiment in China Baidu, which was called out by regulators weeks ago, in mid-June cut its revenue forecast for the second quarter to between $2.81 billion and $2.82 billion from $3.12 billion to $3.19 billion. Shelleen Shum, forecasting analyst at eMarketer, predicts Baidu's search revenue will be affected in the short term but normalize down the road. "The clearer marking of sponsored links and reduction in ads per page may lead to a better user experience and more sustainable growth," she wrote in an email. To diversity its revenues, Baidu has been making big investments in services linking the offline and online world, such as platforms for ordering takeout. But search is still its bread and butter, and Ms. Shum expects it to remain so for the near future.

The company often changes the New Tab page in Chrome, and now it looks like it’s experimenting with building a New Tab page that’s powered by Google Now. The new feature is live now in the developer version of Google Chrome for Android, which can be downloaded from Google Play. Google Now just hasn’t really lived up to the hype, and while many have high hopes for the new Google Assistant, it’s nice to see Google Now getting a little more proactive and living in a place where we’ll see it on a regular basis. Related: Google adds a Dashboard to Google Now, but only for the rumored Nexus Launcher The new feature seems to basically be an expansion of a previous option, “Show content snippets on the New Tab Page.” The feature isn’t available on desktop, but if it’s successful, it could certainly make its way over at some point in the future. View photos chrome-new-tab-devMore The Google Now-powered suggestions seem to largely be related to recent bookmarks and news stories, however it’s likely that the feature will change over time, especially considering the fact that it hasn’t even been released to the public yet. To try out the new feature for yourself, you’ll first need to download the developer version of Chrome. If after downloading the app, you still can’t see the new content, you may need to check the “Show content snippets on the New Tab Page,” by going to chrome://flags. You can also choose other modes within the flag, such as showing some content based on nonpersonalized data. It’s important to keep in mind that this is still just a feature in the developer version of Chrome, so there will most likely be bugs. If you’re an average user, you may just want to wait until the feature hits the consumer version of Chrome, which will likely be within a few months.

Your iPhone can do virtual reality! All you need is an inexpensive headset and these cool apps. The 7 best VR apps for iPhone 0 Mobile by Rick Broida June 15, 2016 9:34 AM PDT @cheapskateblog Up Next The biggest tech turkeys of 2016 A beginner's guide to VR Don't know what VR is? This guide will answer your most basic questions. by Eric Franklin 2:00 Close Drag When it comes to smartphone-powered VR, Google Cardboard gets all the attention because, well, it's pretty much the only game in town. Indeed, WWDC came and went without a single mention of virtual reality, meaning Apple will continue to sit on the sidelines. Fortunately for iPhone owners, that doesn't mean you need to switch to Android if you want to enjoy virtual experiences. In fact, you can dive into VR right now; all you need is a headset and some apps. The headset is easy: Google Cardboard or anything compatible will work with just about any iPhone. To really do this on the cheap, head to Unofficial Cardboard, where you can score a simple, plain-white viewer for free. (You pay only $2.95 for shipping. If you want a decal and/or head strap, you can pay a few bucks extra.) Enlarge Image Your iPhone can pull VR duty. You supply the viewer and the apps.Photo by Rick Broida/CNET As for the apps, look no further than the App Store. Mostly you'll find games in there (and I'll be back tomorrow to showcase the best VR games for iPhone), but that's not everybody's jam. If you'd rather explore the world, take center stage in a documentary or, you know, travel to the moon, check out these amazing iPhone apps. Google Street View Want to take a virtual tour of Stonehenge? How about downtown Chicago? Or your very own town? It's possible thanks to Google's Street View app. Street View is the mobile version of Google's ground-level Maps feature. Put the two together and presto: Now you get a virtual-reality view of anywhere you can visit in Street View. And Street View has visited just about everywhere: the app showcases not only Google's own mapping efforts, but also users'. In fact, you can use Street View to create your own 360-degree "photo spheres" and add them to the collection. Jaunt VR Enlarge Image Jaunt VR's interface takes advantage of VR as well.Photo by Screenshot by Rick Broida/CNET Music, sports, travel, film -- the Jaunt VR app aggregates a wide variety of 360-degree and virtual reality videos, all housed in an attractive gaze-based interface (meaning you can navigate just by looking at various buttons and menu options). If you have kids, be sure to let them check out the adorable animated short, "The Invasion." NYT VR Some of the most interesting virtual reality experiences are coming from the New York Times. The newspaper's eponymous app is home to a number of exclusive cinematic experiences, including a dizzying climb to the top of 1 World Trade Center, a virtual visit to Pluto and a short documentary chronicling children displaced by war. There's currently no better source for original VR-enhanced stories. Orbulus Special Edition Enlarge Image Pick an orb, any orb -- then get transported to that location.Photo by Screenshot by Rick Broida/CNET Orbulus is all about 360-degree photo spheres, in this case a collection of user-supplied destinations enhanced with sound or music. To choose a sphere from the gallery, you simply focus on it for a few seconds. Once you're "inside," you can zoom in or out by tilting your head right or left. It's an interesting way to travel the globe, with destinations ranging from Hong Kong to San Francisco. Vrse Enlarge Image Vrse is all about the movies.Photo by Screenshot by Rick Broida/CNET Sort of a mix between Jaunt and NYT VR (with some of the same content you'll find in both), Vrse focuses strictly on VR cinema. There's no organization to these curated videos, just a scrolling list you peruse before putting your phone into your viewer. Once you tap a selection, you have the choice of streaming or downloading it -- the latter a nice option for offline viewing. Virtual Reality Moon Enlarge Image Goodnight, Earth.Photo by Screenshot by Rick Broida/CNET Sad to say you're not likely to ever visit the moon for real. The next best thing, at least for now: Virtual Reality Moon. On this free (but heavily ad-supported) trip, you're instantly transported to the moon's surface, where you can see both Earth and the International Space Station in the distance. You can also walk around, though this requires either a gamepad or a viewer that has an action button. YouTube Finally, we come to YouTube, which is home to an exploding number of 360-degree and VR videos. Just search the app for anything with "360" or "VR" in the name, or head straight to YouTube's 360 Channel. But that's not all: You can actually watch any YouTube video in VR mode. The experience isn't always great, but it's still a lot of fun to play around with. Which VR apps would you consider essential for iPhone users?

Matt Kapko (CIO (US)) 30 July, 2016 06:01 - - - - print email Comments Three of the world's largest and most influential technology companies — Apple, Facebook and Google — this week reported their latest earnings results for the quarter ending in June 2016. Facebook closed the week with its stock at an all-time high. Following impressive growth during the previous quarter, it is now among the five most valuable companies in the world. Apple sits atop that list with a market cap of $567.8 billion, and Google is next, with a cap of $546.7 billion. Facebook is valued at $362.9 billion, placing it fifth on the list behind Microsoft ($444.4 billion) and Amazon ($368.5 billion). Here's a quick summary of the highs (and lows) of the financials from the three companies: Apple continues to decline Apple's 13-year revenue growth streak came to an end earlier this year, and the trend continued in the company's fiscal third quarter of 2016. Many of Apple's key business metrics are in decline, including revenue, which dipped almost 15 percent year over year to $42.4 billion. Sales of Apple's flagship products and geographic growth also shrunk, according to the company's financial results. Sales of iPads and services (mostly iTunes and App Store) were the only growth areas for Apple. Its services business grew by 19 percent year over year to $5.9 billion, and though iPad shipments were down by 9 percent, related tablets revenue jumped 7 percent to almost $4.9 billion. iPhone sales declined by 15 percent year over year to 40.4 million, and revenue from Apple's smartphone business dropped 23 percent year over year to $24 billion. Apple banked $7.8 billion in net income on $42.4 billion in revenue during the quarter. The company also said it sold its billionth iPhone in July. Facebook audience growth soars Facebook saw growth in every important metric during the second quarter of 2016. Its ad revenue jumped 63 percent year over year to $6.24 billion, and the company said 1.71 billion people now use the service at least once a month, a use number that's up 15 percent year over year. Facebook's daily active users rose 17 percent year over year to 1.13 billion, and 1.03 billion of those people use mobile devices to access Facebook every day, according to the company. During the earnings call, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg reiterated the company's long-term vision for "a world that is video first, with video at the heart of all our apps and services." Zuckerberg said the company doesn't plan to run pre-roll ads before videos and will instead opt to run interstitial ads between video segments. Facebook provided no details or timeline for when ads might make their way to live video. The company banked $2.05 billion in net income on $6.44 billion in revenue during the second quarter of 2016. Demand for ads, cloud services help Google beat expectations Google's parent company Alphabet was the last of the three tech giants to report earnings this week, and its results were among the most impressive and unexpected. Strong demand for ads on Google's search engine and other products drove a 21 percent year-over-year increase in revenue. Clicks on Google ads increased 29 percent, and advertisers' cost-per-click dropped 7 percent from the prior year, according to the company. Google's non-advertising business, which includes enterprise cloud services, the Google Play store and hardware, grew by 33 percent year over year, to $2.17 billion. During the earnings call, Google execs attributed much of that growth to its cloud business. Google's experimental projects, "moonshots" or "other bets," resulted in an $859 million loss on $185 million in revenue. The company banked $4.88 billion in net income on $21.5 billion in revenue during the second quarter of 2016.

No problem! There are plenty of cool VR games for iOS. All you need is a headset. The 7 best VR games for iPhone 0 Gaming by Rick Broida June 16, 2016 8:49 AM PDT @cheapskateblog Up Next The biggest tech turkeys of 2016 Enlarge Image Expect to see a lot of this kind of reaction to iPhone-powered VR.Photo by Rick Broida/CNET Warning: You're about to cross over. Once you've tried games in virtual reality, it's going to be awfully difficult to go back to 2D gaming on a TV or monitor. Better yet, you can enjoy some stellar VR experiences right away on your iPhone. This tends to surprise people, as Google Cardboard is the best-known driver of smartphone-powered VR and Google doesn't make iPhones. But the reality is Apple's phones can work inside just about any Google Cardboard (or compatible) viewer. Now it's just a matter of finding the best VR games! Not into games? Check out my list of the 7 best VR apps for iPhone where you'll find virtual concerts, movies, even trips to the moon. The App Store is all but exploding with cool new VR games. Below I've rounded up a selection of mostly-free virtual experiences you won't want to miss. End Space VR Screenshots really don't do End Space VR justice.Photo by Screenshot by Rick Broida/CNET Action and outer space seem like a perfect fit for VR, and End Space VR proves it. You're the fighter pilot, tasked with eliminating wave after wave of alien attackers. The action is fluid, the graphics beautiful. Ideally you'll pair your phone with a gamepad so you have a weapons trigger, but you can also rely on gaze-based aiming and shooting. Fractal Combat X Freemium jet-fighter Fractal Combat X is unique in that you can play it with or without a VR headset. If you want to use one, you'll need to enable the option in the Graphics settings menu -- either way, you will need a controller. In this game, your head serves as the joystick: wherever you look, that's where your jet flies. Fractal Combat X offers impressive graphics and tons of RPG-style upgrade options for your jets and weapons. You can earn credits by playing, but you'll need to spend a few bucks if you want quick upgrades. InCell VR Dizzying and dazzling, InCell VR shrinks you down for a thrill ride inside a human body. Your goal is to eliminate viruses and save the host's cells from destruction. This is another game you can play with or without VR. If you use a headset, it'll be a good test of your ability to withstand motion sickness, but it's worth the risk. InCell VR is not some cobbled-together VR experiment; it's a fully formed and highly entertaining game. While you're at it, check out InMind VR from the same developer. Both games are free. Lamper VR: Firefly Rescue Lamper VR: Firefly Rescue, sequel to the classic Lamper VR, offers more of the same: an endless-runner gaming experience notable for great graphics and a decidedly kid-friendly motif. (You're a firefly, after all.) There's no game controller necessary: your head does all the steering. Roller Coaster VR Enlarge Image Good luck finding a coaster like this in the real world.Photo by Screenshot by Rick Broida/CNET Roller Coaster VR is the game (or simulation, anyway) you show your friends when you want to give them their first taste of VR. It's the chance to ride the kind of roller coaster that could never exist in real life, what with the rickety tracks built into the side of a mountain, the jumps, the water hazards, and more. A close second: Cedar Point VR, which takes you for a ride on the amusement park's real-world Valravn coaster. Dramamine not included. Romans from Mars 360 Is it possible for a VR game to be adorable? It is when it's Romans from Mars, a sort of first-person tower-defense game that was already pretty cute in its non-VR version. Here you get to be up close and personal as you fight off wave after wave of invading Martians. And it's completely free, right down to the upgrades. Zombie Shooter VR Enlarge Image In your face, zombies! (No, really, that's where you should shoot them.)Photo by Screenshot by Rick Broida/CNET Admit it: you've always thought you could do better than Rick Grimes and the gang on "The Walking Dead." In Zombie Shooter VR you get to prove your zombie-whompin' mettle as you mow down wave after wave of brain-thirsty walkers. Unlike most auto-shooters, this one puts you on foot, moving through tunnels, subway cars and other spooky environments. It's a first-person shooter on a rail -- a fairly easy one, but immensely satisfying for any fan of the undead. Have you found any other must-have VR games for iOS? Name them in the comments!

Published on August 15, 2016. The Ultimate Soccer Supporter Bar Finder Credit: Heineken/Google Most Popular The rising popularity of European soccer in the U.S. is a very good thing for beer brands. Because the early match times mean more daytime drinking at bars. Kegs and eggs anyone? Now Heineken is trying to lure more soccer fans to pubs via a new partnership with Google. The program, which is part of Heineken's broader "Soccer Is Here" campaign, involves a mobile website that allows fans to find out which bars are showing matches featuring their favorite teams. For now, the program is only available in New York City. But Heineken USA will consider expanding the program to other cities if it proves popular, said Heineken brand manager Rob Ryder. Fans entering "soccerishere.com" into their mobile internet browser will see a map of New York City with participating bars highlighted showing featured matches. Fans can search by league, match or venue. The program includes matches from the UEFA Champions League, the English Premier League, the Spanish league La Liga, as well as Major League Soccer games in the U.S. Heineken has identified nearly 200 soccer bars in New York City and the brand is halfway toward its goal of signing them all up with the program, Mr. Ryder said. Participating bars must enter the matches they are showing into an interface that populates the fan site. The site was built using the Google Maps API and powered by Google's local guides, places and search functions, according to a Heineken statement. Heineken will support the initiative with a substantial digital media buy using geo-targeted search, display and video ads, said Betsy Paynter, digital media manager for Heineken USA. The program is an example of how brands are increasingly using their marketing to provide services to consumers, rather than just awareness advertising, which is increasingly difficult in an era of ad blockers and ad skipping. "We were looking at how we can help soccer fans really enjoy the sport in the company of their friends and also in the time-honored tradition of being in a bar," Mr. Ryder said. He has a personal need for it. When he came to the U.S. from the U.K. he tried to catch his favorite team, the Tottenham Hotspur Football Club. But "I was having difficulty identifying where do I go to watch the matches" he said. The program comes as Heineken continues to invest more in soccer as the sport's popularity surges in the states. In January of 2015, Heineken began a multi-year deal sponsorship deal with Major League Soccer, adding to a soccer portfolio that already included a Champions League sponsorship. In March of this year, Heineken launched the year-long "Soccer Is Here" campaign by Publicis, New York. Ads feature soccer stars David Villa, Carli Lloyd and Landon Donovan. Ms. Lloyd is the first female athlete to be a spokeswoman for a beer brand, according to Heineken. Heineken also plans to partner with the Daily Mail for a contest in which fans can vote for the best soccer bar in New York City.

A group of SEO experts and search pros share insights on how SEO rank has evolved and offer advice on how to keep up. James A. Martin (CIO (US)) 04 August, 2016 22:00 - - - - print email Comments Are links on other websites that point to your site an important Google-search ranking factor? The answer used to be blatantly obvious, and for some, it still is. Google, however, made major changes to its search engine algorithm during the past few years. The company also changed the way it displays search results. Then there are mobile search results, which can be different from desktop results, the possible impact (or not) of social media shares, the emergence of Google's RankBrain artificial intelligence (AI), and many other factors that come into play. It's all enough to cause confusion and lead to questions about today's most important search engine ranking factors. We interviewed a set of SEO experts for their takes on the most important ranking factors. They're not listed in order of importance, because not all of the experts agreed on the degrees of importance for factors. However, the consensus is all digital marketers, SEO experts and other search pros should focus on the following six SEO ranking factors. 6 key search-ranking factors 1. Content relevance and SEO rank Google ultimately became the dominant search engine because it is adept at displaying, on the first page of search results, the most relevant content that matches a keyword query. Eventually, users came to assume the search engine only shows the most relevant results first, a behavior that web-usability consultant Jakob Nielsen dubs, "Google Gullibility." Content relevance is often assumed or overlooked in studies of ranking factors, but it's still the most important factor, according to Eric Enge, CEO of Stone Temple Consulting, which offers content marketing, SEO, social media, and Google-penalty recovery services. Relevance is often presumed to be "on" or "off," so content is either relevant or irrelevant to a query. "But that's not really the right view in my opinion," Enge says. "You can't assume that relevance is a binary factor, where you assign a zero score if it's not relevant and a 1 score if it is relevant. True relevance scoring would be on a sliding scale, ranging from 0 to 1, with any possible value in-between. The content with the lower score would need to score somewhat higher on other metrics to outrank the [higher score]." 2. Inbound links and SEO Google made a number of tweaks during the past year, including the rollout of RankBrain and a second mobile-friendly update, but the core ranking factors remain much the same, according to Jayson DeMers, founder and CEO of AudienceBloom, a content- and social-media marketing firm. "The quality of inbound links pointing to your domain or page is still the most important ranking indicator." Links have always been key to high Google ranks. During its early days, Google touted its PageRank technology as an important competitive differentiator. PageRank is Google's "numeric rating of how important it considers pages to be," according to Search Engine Land. Google said in 2011 that PageRank "works by counting the number and quality of links to a page to determine a rough estimate of how important the website is. The underlying assumption is that more important websites are likely to receive more links from other websites." As of earlier this year, Google no longer shares PageRank scores publicly, but it still uses them in ranking calculations, Search Engine Land says. Stone Temple Consulting recently performed a research study to answer the question: "Are links still a powerful ranking factor?" All of the details are available in the company's related blog post, but the gist is that provided the content is relevant and a site doesn't have technical problems or quality issues, links are still highly important. And "authority" is Enge's No. 2 most important ranking factor after content relevance, though it's primarily driven by the quality and diversity of backlinks, he says. SEO consultancy Backlinko recently posted the results of its search engine ranking factors study, based on a million Google search results. Backlinko found that "the number of domains linking to a page correlated with rankings more than any other factor." Backlinko also concluded that a site's overall link authority, as measured by Ahrefs Domain Ratings, "strongly correlates with higher [search] rankings." Rand Fishkin, founder of Moz, which offers SEO and other software tools as a service, says page-level link features are the No. 1 search engine-ranking factor today, assuming a site's content is relevant. These features include Google's PageRank, the quantity of linked root domains, quality of the link sources, and trust metrics. Every other year, Moz releases its own search engine ranking factors survey, and in the last survey for 2015, page-level link features were the No. 2 ranking factor, just slightly below domain-level link features. 3. Content quality and SEO rank Google wants to deliver not only the most relevant content, but also the highest-quality search results. And quality can be measured in a variety of ways, according to Enge, including proper grammar and spelling, reading level, comprehensiveness — how well the content covers the spectrum of user needs related to the query — uniqueness, and a lack of negative signals, such as excessive keyword repetition. (The Content Marketing Institute's blog offers more information in, "How Google judges quality and what you should do about it," and, "What quality content is, and how to help your clients create it.") "Marketers and SEO professionals should still focus on developing the best content they can to attract quality inbound links to their content, and that usually means executing a solid content marketing strategy," says DeMers. "It's harder to stand out these days due to increasing competition in the content sphere, so if there's one change I can recommend … it's investing more to make sure your content is truly remarkable, even if that means creating less content overall." Backlinko's survey results found that "publishing focused content that covers a single topic may help with rankings," and that "longer content tends to rank higher in Google's search results. The average Google first page result contains 1,890 words." And a separate study from BuzzSumo and Moz found that long-form content "of over 1,000 words consistently receives more (social media) shares and links than shorter form content." Searchmetrics, an enterprise SEO and content marketing service provider, ranked content quality as the third most important element in its 2015 study of search ranking factors and rank correlations. Among the factors that can influence such ranking are keywords, in the body of the copy, in internal and external links, and in meta-descriptions; word count; and relevant terms. 4. Technical issues and SEO Like content relevancy, technical issues are sometimes overlooked in SEO ranking factor studies. Technical issues, however, can prevent a site's content from ranking as highly as it could for relevant keyword queries — or keep it from ranking at all. Common technical issues include duplicate content, dubious inbound links, poor navigation, and improper redirects. Google's goal is to deliver a positive user experience, so content on sites with architecture problems won't likely earn high ranking. "You have to solve those problems if you want to play the SEO game," Enge says. In fact, technical issues ranked as the No. 1 most important factor to mitigate in Searchmetrics' study. Technical issues aren't just about problems in a website's structure, however. Technical on-page factors that can play a role in rank include whether or not content has a strong meta-description, if it uses H1 and H2 tags, and whether a site is encrypted via HTTPS. "HTTPS is becoming more relevant and even a ranking signal for Google — but it is not necessary for every site," the Searchmetrics report says. "Encryption is primarily important for sites with purchasing processes or sensitive client information to increase trust and conversion rates." 5. User engagement and SEO rank Does your content truly engage website visitors? If so, Google may reward you with a higher search ranking. Unfortunately, it's unclear how exactly Google measures user engagement. "I don't think anyone in the industry has a good handle on what user engagement measurements might be," Enge says, adding that he doesn't think click-through rates are a direct ranking factor. For some pages, high bounce rates are a positive signal, according to Enge. When visitors land on contact pages in search of phone numbers and then click away, for example, that's a satisfactory user engagement. "But I do believe Google is looking at user engagement in some ways," Enge says. Google software engineer Paul Haahr confirmed as much in a March 2016 presentation, in which he said Google leverages user engagement to evaluate the quality of its ranking algorithms. Moz's Fishkin says user interaction and engagement, along with usage-data signals, are among the top SEO ranking factors. Such signals include clickstream analysis, which collects, analyzes and reports aggregate data on the pages site visitors see and in what order, and visitor traffic. In its beginner's guide to SEO, Moz outlines some user engagement metrics, and provides an explanation of how usability and user experience impact search rankings. Searchmetrics lists user experience as its No. 2 ranking factor, based on elements such as the number of internal links and images, responsive design — when a website adjusts to both mobile and desktop screens — and time spent on site. 6. RankBrain and SEO In March 2016, a Google search executive said RankBrain, links and content are the three top ranking factors, according to Search Engine Land. RankBrain uses AI to help Google "interpret the searches that people submit to find pages that might not have the exact words that were researched for," Search Engine Land says. But some SEO professionals aren't convinced RankBrain is such an important factor. Google has said many times that RankBrain has a larger impact on long-tail queries, according to Enge. (Long-tail queries are highly specific search phrases with multiple words.) RankBrain runs on all queries, he says, but it doesn't impact broad or generic keyword search terms at all. Instead, it impacts keywords terms that are a bit more complex "infrequently," and RankBrain affects long-tail keyword phrases "fairly often," Enge says. SEO tips and best practices for 2016 1. Don't overemphasize social media shares After Google+'s fall from grace, social signals lost a lot of search sway, especially for personalized results, according to Moz's Fishkin. And Enge points out, "social media sources can be shut off at any time, so Google doesn't want to make it part of their core algorithm." 2. Ranking factors are intertwined Some misconceptions about ranking factors come from the idea that site owners can make a handful of changes or tweaks to pages and quickly see them rank, according to Holly Miller, a Searchmetrics SEO expert and professional services manager. "There are a lot of factors at play," she says. "A lot of the technical and content elements have to work together in concert to provide a superior user experience. It's ultimately about asking yourself, 'Does this content help the user accomplish X?' Or ,'Does this content answer their question?'" 3. Always keep user experience in mind Usability, user experience, speed, and the ability to deliver unique value are crucial to SEO, according to Fishkin. "These were often the domains of other marketing and website professionals in the past, and SEOs merely helped with more technical and keyword-based on-page and off-page signals," he says. "But today, to succeed long-term in search, you need these elements of stickiness and remarkability."

WIRE Uber's First Self-Driving Cars Will Start Taking Passengers This Month The ridesharing giant is rolling out a pilot program to test self-driving cars on customers in downtown Pittsburgh. By Zoë Henry Zoë Henry is a staff reporter at Inc. and a graduate of Brown University. She lives in Brooklyn, New York. @ZoeLaHenry Reporter, Inc.@ZoeLaHenry WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Courtesy Volvo Advertisement Uber is sending a fleet of semi-autonomous cars to pick up passengers in downtown Pittsburgh this month, according to a Bloomberg report. The bold move suggests that the ridesharing giant is pulling ahead of rivals Google and Tesla, who are also in the race to develop self-driving cars. (Google is working on its own ridesharing service, increasing the competition against Uber.) The company announced a $300 million deal with Volvo to develop a fully autonomous car by 2021. A handful of self-driving Volvo XC90 SUVs will be deployed as part of the pilot program later this month, with 100 expected by the end of the year. "We are going commercial," Uber co-founder and CEO Travis Kalanick told Bloomberg. "This can't just be about science." For now, the pilot trips will be free, and every test vehicle will come equipped with a human supervisor in the front seat--ready to take control if there's a system malfunction. A co-pilot in the passenger seat will be there to take notes, and the entire ride will be recorded on camera. To build out the technology, Uber recently agreed to acquire Otto, a San Francisco-based driverless truck startup. Otto developed a program that lets trucks steer themselves, aspects of which will be integrated into Uber's cabs. Kalanick sees self-driving cars as "existential" for his firm, which was most recently valued at more than $62 billion. "The minute it was clear to us that our friends in Mountain View were going to be getting in the ridesharing space, we needed to make sure there is an alternative [self-driving cars]," he said. "Because if there is not, we're not going to have any business." The service may face scrutiny in the coming months, as concerns over the safety of these vehicles mount. Last month, a driver using Tesla's autopilot service died after a collision with a tractor-trailer, and several of Google's cars have logged minor accidents. Published on: Aug 18, 2016 Advertisement

The company often changes the New Tab page in Chrome, and now it looks like it’s experimenting with building a New Tab page that’s powered by Google Now. The new feature is live now in the developer version of Google Chrome for Android, which can be downloaded from Google Play. Google Now just hasn’t really lived up to the hype, and while many have high hopes for the new Google Assistant, it’s nice to see Google Now getting a little more proactive and living in a place where we’ll see it on a regular basis. Related: Google adds a Dashboard to Google Now, but only for the rumored Nexus Launcher The new feature seems to basically be an expansion of a previous option, “Show content snippets on the New Tab Page.” The feature isn’t available on desktop, but if it’s successful, it could certainly make its way over at some point in the future. The Google Now-powered suggestions seem to largely be related to recent bookmarks and news stories, however it’s likely that the feature will change over time, especially considering the fact that it hasn’t even been released to the public yet. To try out the new feature for yourself, you’ll first need to download the developer version of Chrome. If after downloading the app, you still can’t see the new content, you may need to check the “Show content snippets on the New Tab Page,” by going to chrome://flags. You can also choose other modes within the flag, such as showing some content based on nonpersonalized data. It’s important to keep in mind that this is still just a feature in the developer version of Chrome, so there will most likely be bugs. If you’re an average user, you may just want to wait until the feature hits the consumer version of Chrome, which will likely be within a few months.

REUTERS/Elijah Nouvelage TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY - RTS2BZM Reuters/Elijah Nouvelage TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY - RTS2BZM 15 August 2016 The idea of self-driving cars powering down Dubai's Sheikh Zayed Road or cruising along the Abu Dhabi Corniche was given a big thumbs up by the results of a survey released on Sunday. A new study entitled 'Self-Driving Vehicles, Robo-Taxis, and the Urban Mobility Revolution', which was carried out by the Boston Consulting Group (BCG), in collaboration with the World Economic Forum, found that 70 percent of consumers surveyed in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are open to trying a self-driving vehicle. Carried out in August 2015 and including 504 respondents from the UAE, the survey also found 47 percent said they would be willing to pay more for a fully self-driving car, with third saying they would be willing to spend up to $5,000 more to be able to lie back and let the car do all the driving itself. The openness to self-driving vehicles was also much higher in the UAE than the global average, which BCG found was around 58 percent in other urban cities included in the study. The results are encouraging news for the Dubai government, which announced in April it hopes 25 percent of car journeys will be by automated vehicles by 2030. Advertisement "There is a compelling case to be made for SDVs in cities," Nikolaus Lang, a BCG senior partner and report co-author, was quoted as saying in a press statement. "Ride-shared, electric robo-taxis can substantially transform and improve urban transportation and, by direct extension, livability, by providing more people with easier access to mobility, making streets safer, and freeing up space no longer needed for parking," The widespread adoption of automated vehicles also has other benefits and could result in a 60 percent drop in the number of cars on roads, an 80 percent decrease in tailpipe emissions and a 90 percent reduction in road accidents.

Users of Google Hangouts On Air will now use YouTube Live. Individuals and groups planning on using Google Hangouts On Air to live-stream content to audiences around the world had better hurry. Those wishing to schedule new Hangouts, take note: Google announced Aug. 15 that it is moving the video-streaming service to YouTube Live from Google+ effective Sept. 12. New live-stream events cannot be scheduled on Google+ after Sept. 12, and all users—even those who already had events scheduled after that date—will need to move to YouTube. Users with recorded events on Hangouts On Air will continue to have access to the content on YouTube. A read-only version of recorded event content will be available in the Activity Log on Google+, the company said. On a web page announcing the move, Google described the process users will need to set up Hangouts On Air with YouTube Live. It also listed some of the applications and features currently available with Hangouts On Air that will not make the transition to YouTube—at least not immediately. Among the features that will remain are the Q&A feature, Showcase and Applause, Google said. Users wishing to include a Q&A with their live stream on YouTube will be able to use a Q&A feature available with Google Slides instead. “You can also use various social media platforms to gather questions ahead of the event,” Google noted. Those wishing to showcase their event could use the YouTube event description to share links with the audience, Google said. Google launched Hangouts On Air in September 2011, but only to a small number of broadcasters. At the time the company described it as service that would let people create and broadcast “onscreen experiences” to a wide audience, just as Hangouts did on a smaller scale. Prompted by what it described as the creative ways in which the initial community of broadcasters used Hangouts On Air, Google made the feature available to everyone on Google + in May 2012. Google so far has offered no explanation for its apparently sudden decision to move Hangouts On Air to YouTube Live. No data also appears to be available on how widely used the service is among users looking to live-stream events to large audiences. So it is unclear whether declining participation and interest in the service prompted the decision. It also is not clear if the lack of mobile support for Hangouts On Air influenced Google’s decision to move the streaming feature to YouTube Live. But it has been used for some prominent Hangout broadcasts, including a Jan. 30, 2012, event during which President Barack Obama conducted a virtual interview on his State of the Union address.           LATEST CLOUD ARTICLES   New Tool Shines Light on $5 Billion Web Traffic Fraud Racket Microsoft's Azure Advisor Helps Customers Float Cloud Applications Early Stage Startup Heptio Aims to Make Kubernetes Friendly Google, Intel to Collaborate on Cloud, IoT Technolgies Social Media Sites Take Risks When Blocking Speech They Don't Like                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

Simply go to myactivity.google.com to see the history of your searches, YouTube viewing and everything else you do on Google platforms, and then be guided through the process of trimming that history. But be careful. Privacy restrictions bring with them good and bad, and some consumers who become gung ho about deleting activity may find the usefulness of their web surfing drop off. Ads will become much more generic and annoying, as will searches and other web research. Your Chrome browser won’t autofill URLs of sites you often visit, and other background activities may become more difficult. Also, the forgetting process can be painstaking. If you are going to be selective about what is forgotten, you will have to review places you’ve visited and make deletions one at a time. If you want to clean up a lot of history, you’ll need to clear your schedule first. But the process, even if you opt to not delete a thing, is eye-opening. Seeing every search you’ve performed and every site you’ve visited is a powerful wakeup call if you hadn’t realized how much is retained. It also raises questions about whether your security and privacy are actually compromised by Google making all of this data available to you. At the top of the “My Activity” page, you’ll see this unconvincing promise: “Only you can see this data. Google protects your privacy and security.” Really? No Google employee can see this data? No Google advertiser can, even in aggregated form? That statement coming from Google is akin to a politician saying, “Trust me.” But if you are concerned about your online privacy, you probably already knew Google had a lot of data about your online life. The thing that’s different is that Google, in making that information available to you, is placing it on the public internet. Password-protected, yes, but the effectiveness of that protection varies widely with the person devising the password. Google’s point, presumably, is that your neighbor, ex-spouse or employer cannot view your personal search history by calling up this page. Maybe it should add, “Depending, of course, on their hacking skills.” Not that a hacker would need great skills if a user has weak credentials, writes them down and leaves them next to the computer, or just lets that neighbor, ex-spouse or employer look over his shoulder as he keys them in. This is yet another reason for people to use complex passwords that are unique (meaning never used in more than one place) and for Google to go with more stringent multifactor authentication. If Google is going to allow consumers to see everything being retained about them, it should at the very least increase the perception of its security measures. There’s something else to consider here, though, and this has societal implications. Google’s forget policy has some key right-to-know overlaps with its takedown policy. The takedown policy allows people to request that stories about or images of them be removed from the database. The forget policy allows the user to decide on his own to delete something.

What about terrorists who want to shield from law enforcement history about sites they have visited? What if it’s a CEO or elected or appointed government official who wants to hide activity that’s embarrassing or hints at illegality? Sure, “terrorist” is an emotionally charged term that I included to feed fear and paranoia. Maybe the right to delete is similar to free speech, though: It’s only as strong as the degree to which it protects the most vile among us. I like being able to edit my history, but I am painfully aware that allowing the worst among us to do the same can have undesired consequences. That all said, this is a powerful privacy tool. Use it as you choose, but be mindful of the bigger implications of what Google has done.

(Photo: Jeff Chiu, AP) SAN FRANCISCO — Uber customers in downtown Pittsburgh later this month will begin hopping into vehicles that can drive themselves to their destination. The ride-hailing giant, which has been valued at more than $60 billion, also said Thursday it was partnering with Swedish automaker Volvo on a $300-million joint project to develop self-driving vehicles. And it said it bought a start-up that's working on self-driving trucks. Uber has been testing a handful of tech-laden Volvo SUVs in Pittsburgh, which is headquarters for the tech company's nascent autonomous car research facility. Many of its staffers are former robotics experts from nearby Carnegie Mellon University, a self-driving car technology hotbed. Volvo has so far delivered a handful of vehicles with self-driving tech to Uber, which expects to have upward of 100 such Volvos deployed in Pittsburgh by the end of the year. The cars will be staffed with safety drivers, per current transportation laws. USA TODAY Analysis: CEO denies Ford is lagging on self-driving cars But the ultimate goal, often stated by Uber CEO Travis Kalanick, is to replace Uber drivers with autonomous vehicles, which will drive down the cost of each ride dramatically for consumers while increasing revenue for Uber. Uber also announced it acquired startup Otto, which is working on self-driving trucks. Otto co-founder Anthony Levandowski will lead Uber's combined self-driving initiatives. In an interview with USA TODAY, Kalanick said the idea with Otto is to provide owner-operator long-haul truckers with in-car tech that will "help them maximize their asset," by allowing the truck to operate 24 hours a day with autonomous spells during which the driver could sleep. Competition is heating up in the race to develop the first commercial autonomous car, which until recently existed only in the realm of sci-fi novels and films. Uber's news comes just days after Ford held a press conference at its R&D facility in Palo Alto to announce its intention to build fully autonomous cars by 2021, using a growing fleet of Ford Fusion Hybrids as test mules. Google also is on a seven-year quest to develop a fully autonomous car, which eventually would be built by an automotive manufacturer partner. Earlier this year, Google announced Chrysler would be providing 100 Pacifica minivans that would be equipped with Google's self-driving tech. In a statement, Volvo said it would effectively be teaming up with Uber to ensure that both companies accelerate the pace of their respective self-driving products. "Both Uber and Volvo will use the same base vehicle for the next stage of their own autonomous car strategies," the Volvo statement reads. "This will involve Uber adding its own self-developed autonomous driving systems to the Volvo base vehicle. Volvo will use the same base vehicle for the next stage of its own autonomous car strategy, which will involve fully autonomous driving." In the same statement, Uber's Kalanick noted "over one million people die in car accidents every year. These are tragedies that self-driving technology can help solve, but we can’t do this alone." The Uber deal with Volvo isn't exclusive, leaving the ride-hailing service open to partner with other automakers on self-driving technology down the road. Risks still abound Although a future with self-driving vehicles carries a lot of promise, the technology has drawn fresh concerns after the owner of a Tesla Model S died in a crash while using the vehicle's Autopilot feature. The computer-controlled Autopilot manages basic driving functions of the car including braking and changing lanes, but drivers are still required to remain aware of their surroundings while it's engaged. Federal regulators are investigating the crash. As tech and automotive companies continue to make big strides in the field of automated driving, what remains to be seen is both how quickly consumers will warm to the idea of ceding control to a computer and how fast federal regulations can keep up with the tech developments.

While it’s deservedly a “must watch” talk, we have provided the transcript if you prefer to read it in a shorter amount of time. We hope you enjoy the presentation as much as we did! Video Transcript Introduction Hi everyone. I’m Adrian Cockroft, and currently work at Battery Ventures. Why am I here? Well, I thought you hadn’t enough drinking games, so I should just do an in-depth tutorial on microservices for the next two or three hours, how about that? Okay, well let’s not do that. What I’m actually going talk about, how do we wrap up a conference like this? I’m going to talk about simplifying the future in a number of different ways. Really, why am I here? Let’s just go with this, this is a tweet from 2012, retweeted by some guy called Andrew Clay Shafer. That what I was doing in 2012, was going around trying to explain all of this stuff Netflix was doing, and I called it “baffling late adopters-as-a-service”. We were pioneering, and we were trying to build things that hadn’t been built before, and we were trying to explain things that hadn’t been done before. This is now more than 4 years later. This has matured, it is now mainstream. It’s now what a lot of people are doing, and it’s what a lot of you are doing. Life Is Complicated Where do we go from here, and how can we apply these lessons as we go forward? That’s really what I wanted to talk about. Think about the future, let’s start with a bit of science fiction. Let’s start with this one. What’s the meaning of life, the universe, and everything? Right, you know that. What’s the answer? 42. Well, that was really simple. I can go now, right? Sometimes really complicated things have simple answers. There’s another really useful thing from this particular story. It comes with a really nice label on the cover about not panicking, so that’s good. If we think about this, life is complicated. It’s an extremely complicated world we live in. We seem to manage to deal with it. There’s a lot of simple abstractions we use for dealing with life, and dealing with all the things we’re working with and all the things we’re building. I’m going to talk about the things that are complicated in our lives, things that are complicated in the way we build things and the way we work, and then a little bit about where things might go. What’s the Most Complicated Thing You Deal With Intuitively? [2:19] What do I mean by life’s complicated? If you think about somebody saying, that’s too complicated. What they’re really saying is I can’t figure out what it’s going to do next. I can’t intuit it’s behavior. It’s got too many moving parts, and I haven’t figured out an internal model of how it works, and what it does. Think about that, what’s the most complicated thing that you can do intuitively? Let’s think about that question. Just think about it. How do you get around? You’re driving cars. Driving is one of the most complicated things that you could possibly think about doing. Driving across a city, you have to know how to control the car, you have to be able to deal with the other traffic. It’s insanely complicated, it’s quite dangerous. We expect just about every human being in the world to be able to do it. That shows the capability of humans to master complicated things when they have a real need to do it. That’s one area. Think of something else. What’s the most complicated thing that your kids can do from about the age of two? How many people’s kids have an iPad? What is going on inside that little lump of glass and aluminum? It’s insanely complicated what is actually happening inside an iPhone, iPad, a tablet, whatever, a games console. Those things. Pre-verbal kids can pick up an iPad and just descend into it immediately. You don’t have to send them on a training class to learn how to figure out how to use this thing. We still have these problems with kids. One of the problems we discovered in thinking about TV and the way people interact with TV sets, we kept discovering that the bottom of your TV set has this mucky stripe on it, where the kids are trying to get the thing to go to next page. I have one friend who said they can’t watch TV with their kid in the room, but it gets incredibly upset that this stupid thing is not behaving properly. They learned, that you’re supposed to be able to reach into these images and manipulate it. This one wasn’t working right. [4:29] That’s interesting. What’s going on, is you have built this portal to the internet that’s got the world’s information in it. It’s got incredibly complex applications in it, but it’s something that is incredibly easy to use with no training. That’s a different type of simplicity that people have added to an extremely complex system. We’re builders, we’re developers. We should be aspiring to build things that you can give to a 2-year-old, and they can intuitively understand how they operate, and what to do with them. You’d be really satisfied with yourself if you managed to build something that has that level of intuition to it. It was huge of amount of work, particularly at Apple when they first came out with the touch-based user interface, that is was that intuitive. [5:17] What does it actually look like though? Well, I took my phone and of course I added about several applications to it, and then I grouped them. If I give my phone to my wife, or I pick up my wife’s phone, I can’t find anything on it. It looks kind of like this, it’s just a big mess of apps and stuff. We get these things and we make them complicated again. I do want to bring up a really good book, some of you may know XKCD, the cartoon. When Randall Munroe wrote this an amazing book, The Thing Explainer book came out last year using only 1,000 most common words in the English language. I think it’s actually the ten hundred most common words in the English language, because thousand isn’t one of them. He explains lots of lots of things. This is a hand computer, and it’s got all kinds of description about what’s actually going on inside the phone. In words that pretty much anyone can understand. You can take complex things and reduce them to simple descriptions. That’s an interesting way of think about this. Simplifying Work That’s kind of in our daily life. Let’s talk a bit about the way we work, the things we do. Let’s talk a bit about simplifying work. One of the things that came out of Netflix. Netflix is several different things. There’s watching TV, there’s that whole movie and TV content. Then there’s all the technology that’s been largely adopted by the Spring platform. Then there’s the cultural side, the way Netflix operates. One of the really interesting things that I was part of, was the culture deck that came out of Netflix. The freedom responsibility culture, this is a SlideShare with 15 million views. 15 million views for a slide deck. That’s ridiculous all on it’s own. Then Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook said that this may be one of the most important documents to ever come out of the valley and got Reed Hastings to be on Facebook’s board, to try to learn what the hell was going on there. Freedom and Responsibility Culture That’s interesting. The story I have is I joined Netflix in ‘07. When I was interviewing at Netflix, they were trying to explain this culture to me, and half the interview was them trying to explain this strange set of ideas. I found it fascinating. One of the reasons I joined Netflix was to figure out how that worked, and to really get my head inside it. In 2009, one of the management off sites, Reed sent mail out before the off sites saying here’s a deck, I want to publish this. Everyone go through it, annotate it, let’s discuss it, let’s discuss what we want to put, what we will say, what we won’t say. We all, collectively, the management team then was maybe 100 to 200 people, probably over a hundred directors, VPs, all the people across the whole company. We worked on this document at the offsite, gave it back, and he merged all the input together and came up with the initial version of this. It was a collective thing. [8:10] What we were doing was trying to preset the people we were hiring, so that they wouldn’t come in and be baffled and confused. They would see this document. If you were horrified by what it said in the document, you wouldn’t even bother applying, and we wouldn’t have to deal with you. Walking you out of the interview after the first half an hour. In fact, nowadays if you turn up for an interview at Netflix and you have not read this document, you can get walked out. 15 million people have read it, and you want to work here and you haven’t figured that out. That doesn’t make sense. What we found was that it started to condition people for how they expected to see when we onboarded them. It helped create the culture, and maintain the culture. Intentional culture has become a really important thing. We’ve seen other companies do culture decks. Nordstrom has one, lots of other people have written down what do they value, and published it externally in order to try to do that. It’s become a thing now. Think about how could you externalize that. If you’re doing a startup, or you’re starting a company, you get to set the culture. Don’t wait until the company gets big, and you have accidental culture of whoever will happen to be there. Be very intentional very early about what you want to have. Purpose-Driven Culture [9:24] So what is in this culture? Here’s an interesting, just one slide from it. “If you want to build a ship, don’t drum up the people to gather wood, divide the work, and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea.” That’s interesting. That’s a purpose driven culture. It’s like, if everyone agrees what the purpose of the company is, then they will figure out how to implement that purpose. The implementation, you don’t need to do fine grain, telling everybody what to do. You can just set, this is where we need to go, everyone else figure it out. This is from a book called The Little Prince. This was in the original deck in ‘09, and it just happens that Netflix has a deal for the Little Prince. It releases tomorrow. This is a pure luck thing. There’s an animated show. It’s an excellent little movie. You can go home tomorrow night and watch The Little Prince with your kids, and be all inspired and note when this quote comes by. That’s a whole interesting area, but what we’re doing here, the simplicity. How simple is it to have a purpose and express a purpose? Purposes are a simple statement. That’s a simplifying thing. Setting out all the individual processes that you would need to make people gather the wood, and build ships and stuff, is much more complicated. It’s actually easier and simpler to express a purpose driven culture, and then itself organizes around that. Imposing Process Drives Away Talent [11:02] One of the other things we found, if you impose process on people, it drives talent away. This is a big problem, because everybody needs more talent, right? I was trying to explain this when I was doing one of my explanations that this is all the Netflix stuff, and this is what we did. I was doing it at an executive CTO summit. Somebody said yeah, we can’t copy Netflix because it has all these superstar engineers and we don’t have those people. I look around the name badges of the companies and said, well we hired them from you. You had these people at some point. There isn’t a cloning machine at Netflix that produces Netflix engineers from nothing. They come from other places, and they bring experiences with them. What we found, over and over again, was that people were producing a fraction of what they could produce at most companies, because they were being held back by the process and by stupid rules, and by all kinds of things that were just slowing them down. When you get out of the way of innovation, and you get behind people, you find that you’ll magnify their ability to do things. You can get many, many times more out of a good senior engineer by getting behind them and pushing, instead of getting in front of them and getting in their way. There’s a lot of tricks to how to actually get that done. That is the essential reason why we were able to do, with a relatively small team, build an awful lot of things. Build a very pioneering culture. This is one of the things about Netflix, that time I was there, was that we built a culture and a team that could build things that had never been built before. It’s moved on now, you can build on top of those things. [12:39] How do you organize people? It wouldn’t be a microservices presentation without Conway’s Law in it. This is the fore thing for Conway’s Law, the basic thesis of this article is that organization of the design systems are constrained to produce designs that are copies of the communication structures of the organizations. It turns out the way Netflix was structured was there was lots of autonomous groups with relationships between them, and APIs between them. When we wrote a bunch of code, it came up with this architecture that is now called microservices. We started with a company organization that was already cellular in nature, with lots of local responsibility, and lots of fairly well-defined interfaces. [13:24] If you’re trying to build a microservice architecture, and you haven’t got that organization, you’re going to have a lot of trouble. The people that are succeeding in this space have co-located small teams that own a thing. They own all the different stages in producing that thing. Then they have relationships to other teams. They are very high trust, high cohesion within a team, and relatively low trust across teams. In the two and half years since I left Netflix, I’ve been talking to lots of enterprises who’ve been trying to figure out, how do we apply the lessons here to an enterprise that’s much bigger, much more complicated. Maybe government organizations, which are low trust organizations. Say, well you have a small group that has high trust, and you really want them to be co-located and own a thing, and then have a trust boundary to the other parts. You can have low trust across those boundaries. [14:18] It’s really no different to programming on the internet. I can use an API from Google or Twitter, or wherever. I don’t necessarily have to have a high trust, and know the people that implemented the Google Maps API to use it. It’s just an API to a thing, and I assume a stable API. You build your organization out of a series of stable APIs, and because they’re people you can go talk to, you can maybe mutate those APIs a bit more readily, than if you go ask Google for a new feature for Google Maps. You’ve got a bit more leverage, but you should be treating these things as stable interfaces between parts of your company to build everything out. Systems Are Flexible and Simple. Rules Are Complicated and Rigid What I’m really saying here is that if you build purpose driven cultures, and systems thinking based approaches, that you’re building flexible models for building companies. You’re building organizations that can evolve as technology moves on. The more rules you put in, the more complex it gets, and the more rigid it gets. You end up with the sort of scenario, we have version two of the company architecture, and 3 years later, there is huge piece of work to try to get to version three of that architecture. A few years later, a huge project to get everybody to version four of the architecture. That’s an old, rigid based way of thinking about it. What you want to do is build an architecture that’s continuously evolving. There’s no actual version of Netflix. There’s no version of the system there. It’s a collection of hundreds of versions, that are changing all the time. You Built it. You Run it. [15:50] One more sort of thought here, there’s one things that you can do if you’re trying to get to this kind of model. One systems thinking sort of trick to try. This comes from one of the first things that we really took to heart in 2009 when we started looking at that. Which was Werner Vogels, in 2006 published an article on the way that Amazon was doing stuff. He said, you built it, you run. If you built some code, you’re on call for that code. If you do nothing but put your developers on call, it will make the biggest difference. It’s the place to start. Magically developers start writing reliable code that doesn’t break. They don’t push stuff to production on Friday afternoons, because they want to go home for the weekend and not have to deal with broken things. You’re sending the pain back to where it can do the most good. If you put an ops team in charge of production, and sort of throw it over the wall and it’s their problem, then you’re giving up on that feedback loop. It’s very powerful, and it’s one of the things we did. We went from a monolithic architecture of everyone wrote a Java file, and QA mashed it together into this big monster. Every two weeks we’d try to get this monster into production, which would usually take several days of debugging to get the thing to work right. To everyone that was delivering a JAR, now delivered a service that incorporated that JAR with an API, and you could manage, you were on call if that service broke. That was the transition that we went through. It cleaned everything up enormously. That’s how I think you can simplify the way that you run your organizations, and take some lessons from the cultural changes there. I’m seeing lots of large companies doing this. This is not just a unicorns get to do this. Really, everybody is doing this now. The people that are being successful are doing a good job of it. Simplify the Things We Build [17:46] Let’s talk about the things we build. How can we simplify the products we’re trying to build, and how do we decide what even to build? One of the first things that I suggest you try to do, is to get away from thinking about projects, and start thinking about products. Unfortunately if your title is Project Manager, that’s not a good time. See if you can find a company that hasn’t done this yet, and go work there for awhile while you’re trying to learn to code of something. I’m sorry, they’re really aren’t any Project Managers in this new model. The ration of productive developers to overhead staff that are involved in managing and delivering stuff radically changes. You have more developers and fewer people doing deployment and management and delivery. That ratio has to change, because your competitors that have figured this out have already changed that ratio. That’s kind of the bad news, I feel like. From Project to Product [18:46] The thing about a project is you form a team and go do something like upgrade SAP, or here’s sort of my horrific thing, you spend 9 months desperately trying to get this thing upgraded. Then everybody runs away from the project in horror and goes to work on something else. Operations is left holding this thing which is no longer able to change. They are locked into it, and they are locked into that vendor and they cannot get in. If you are in a product environment, where your team owns a product, they own the continuous evolution of that product. They are continuously unlocking it. They are changing from one tech version of a technology to another. They are switching out one API to another, they’re switching from one technology or hardware platform to another at small, incremental changes in the evolution of the thing you’re building. It’s very hard to get locked in. In fact, I have a whole talk I did on this where I pointed out that basically, developers don’t care about lock in, because they’re continuously unlocking anyway. It’s the ops people that get stuck with the thing that hate lock-in. This was actually last summer, I basically pointed out that it was kind of like the developers were dating and getting married. Then the ops people were dealing with the divorces. Then you say, why don’t ops people like lock-in? Divorces are not nice things, right? If that’s your general experience of technology, is you’re trying to unlock yourself from it, it’s a very unhappy thing. If the developers are on the whole life cycle, they’ll just keep dating. They’ll never actually get that locked into a thing, and they’ll keep unlocking from it. The analogy gets a bit stretched here, but you get the general idea. That’s one of the reasons why this is such a powerful move, you’re building a team that owns a piece of the system that is continuously evolving that system. If that piece of the system stops evolving very rapidly, you just put it in some maintenance mode. You still need somebody that owns it, because they’ll be a heartbleed bug or something, and you’ll have to go and rev it with some new base components or the platform will change underneath it. Even if the business logic doesn’t change, the platform is going to continue to change. Somebody needs to be responsible keeping it working. That’s one thing. I was at the CIO summit yesterday, I was wearing my jacket. I don’t always wear a jacket, but if I’m pretending I’m a CIO kind of person or something. I notice that everyone else is wearing t-shirts on stage, but I decided I just stick with this. Time to Value People are saying what is the thing you want to optimize for, what’s the metric? The one I think people should be optimizing for it time to value. If you write a piece of code, or you build a thing, and it’s not reached the customer yet, it’s not added value. How quickly does the thing you did get in front of a customer so you can find out, does it work, does it add value. If you’re in a hypothesis testing environment, is this hypothesis now in test mode where you can find out, is this version of the signup flow got a better conversion rate than the old version, or whatever you’re working on. Figure out how to build a value chain, all the way from the customer down through all the different components and dependencies. Figure out how to get a better time to value on it. That’s the really interesting thing. Optimize for the Customers You Want to Have [22:06] Another thought, and this is something that’s a little subtle. Optimize it for the customers you want to have, rather than the customers you have now. What does that mean? Just take the example of a SaaS application like Netflix, you get a month’s free trial, and then at the end of that month, they’re saying please give us ten bucks. Please stay on and be a customer for another month. Almost every test that Netflix is optimizing for that conversion from free trial to paying customer. If you’re in a SaaS business with a free trial, that’s what you’re optimizing for. What you’re actually optimizing for is for customers who’ve never seen the product before. That causes the product to stay simple. Going back to Netflix, they just launched globally. If you live in Zimbabwe, and all of a sudden there’s this thing called Netflix you’ve never heard of, and somebody’s trying to explain it to you, the more complex and the more features there are in it, the more confusing it will be. The harder it will be to figure out, and the less likely you are to sign up and to convert to a paying customer. There’s a built-in feedback loop in here which keeps the product simple. Power uses are always annoyed that there aren’t all these clever features that they keep thinking of that Netflix should do. You end up with Word or something, millions of features that no one knows how to use. Unless you’re a lawyer, lawyers know how to use about half the features in Word. That’s the power thing that they do, redlining documents. [23:44] Think about this, if you optimize for the customers. Sometimes the business you’re in, you have a fixed set of customers. You’re not actually trying to grow, you’re trying to extract more value or hold onto a customer base. Yes, you should optimize for the customers you want to keep. If you optimize for your power users, the product will get more and more complicated, and you will mysteriously discover you will get fewer and fewer new customers. You’re basically painting yourself into the corner, where you’re going to get disrupted by the next simple product that doesn’t have all your features, so why would anyone care about that? It’s missing all these features. Well, that means that people can figure out how to use it. Think about that as how you should be simplifying the things that you are trying to build, and optimizing for the customers you want to have rather than the customers you already have. I talked about the product itself, about how do we build these products. You get to drink again now, here’s another microservices thing. Monolithic apps. People say well they look simpler than microservices, so actually they’re more complex. They only look simple from the outside. If you draw your architecture diagram with one box on it, that looks simple. Then you look at the number of things it’s talking to, it’s obviously not really simple. Then you try to look inside it. One of the things we did at Netflix once, was we tried to create an object hierarchy of our monolithic app. I think there was a line of queue about as wide as this stage, there was 8-point font. The object hierarchy was wall papered on this thing. Bill Jackson is somewhere in the audience, he went and built this enormous object hierarchy so you could see just how complex this thing was inside. It was just massive layers of Java methods and stuff. Microservices Enforce Separation What happens when you break it into chunks? You find out how tangled together it is when you try to break it into chunks. Microservices enforce a separation that makes it less complicated. If anyone ever says microservices are too complicated, no they’re not. They’re less complicated. Fight back, argue back on that one. You’re isolating things, you’re preventing methods from creeping in and gathering data where they shouldn’t be seeing it. You’re preventing end runs around methods to go into the data store. You can see what the real connectivity of your application is. [26:02] Then think about onboarding a new engineer. You’ve hired somebody from outside, they’ve never seen the system at all. You say, okay change this monolith. What’s the probability that they’ll get that right? It’s a lot of stuff that they need to learn. When you say, change this microservice, it’s got 3 inputs, it’s got 2 dependencies. It does one thing. The code can fit in one engineer’s head. They sit down, and they go okay, I’ve changed this. I’ve safely modified a piece of the system, because it’s this bounded context. It’s a simpler thing. It’s simpler to learn, it’s simpler to get people onboard, and it’s simpler to manage. The problem back in 2009, 2010 is the tooling, the monitoring systems couldn’t deal with it. All right, we were trying to build a monitoring system that could deal with a microservice architecture, and they were blowing up. We had to build our own, and it just got too complex. I went to the expo today, and we have monitoring vendors saying yes, microservices we know how to monitor those things. The tooling is now there. They’re now much easier to deal with. Don’t get the push back that it’s too complex. Four Principles to Keep Architecture Simple If we’re trying to build these architectures, so how do we keep the architecture simple? There’s four principles I like to encourage. One is symmetry. Every time something is more symmetric, effectively you’ve created an invariant. If you’ve deployed in more than one region in AWS, and you’re deployment is exactly the same in an automated manner, you’ve created a symmetry. You’ve now got an invariant. It’s going to behave the same way. You don’t write the different set of processes for dealing with this thing, versus this thing. Commonality is important. You want to think how you’re doing it, because you still want to be evolving. You don’t want to say, I need everything to be the same. You need to look for places where you can create symmetry, because that creates invariants, and that lets you create assertions that things are in a known state. Automation is really the key here. If you know every machine in an autoscale group, or running in a thing, is running exactly the same build. The same build packets, the same AMI, it’s the same whatever. Then, you know it’s the same thing. We used to have problems in our data center where we didn’t even have the same firmware revision on all the machines we were running, and that would cause problems. You can get in some very low level problems. The final thing is just systems thinking. Trying to figure out ways to get feedback loops that drive people to do the right things, and drive machines to do the right things. I’ve done talks in a lot of detail into this. You can go find my slideshare account if you want to get more on that. Just to wrap up a bit. Where Are We Going Next? What’s the next thing we’re going to be doing, and how do we figure out, how do we get there? How do we spot what’s happening? I like this quote, there’s a book on systems thinking and creating platform designing business architecture. “We see the world as increasingly more complex and chaotic, because we’re using inadequate concepts to explain it.” Once you have the concepts, once you’ve built your mental models, all of a sudden it’s no longer chaotic or complex. Think about driving a car, there’s a mental model around driving and how cities work, and how traffic works. Once you’ve got that model, it’s no longer chaotic and complex. You can drive to work, and barely even think about driving to work. You’ve said, oh I’ve just suddenly arrived. You were on autopilot in your brain the whole way. We’re dealing with a lot of technologies, and we need a model to figure out which ones are changing fast and which ones are maybe not changing. The model I like to use is something from Simon Wardly. He divides things into things that are innovating, things that are being leveraged, and things that are commoditizing. I’ve got a link to his blog post here. If you actually Google innovate leverage commoditize, it’s the first hit. It’s pretty easy to find. [30:03] What am I talking about here? Well, for innovate let’s go back to something that’s from 10 years ago was an innovation. You can tell it’s an innovation because people are arguing about it, and their words aren’t very well-defined. Let’s think of say something like virtual machines. When they first came out, it was controversial. Then we figured out, okay we have virtual machines, but we get VMs. That sounds like a good thing, and the tooling is starting to come together, and now you can buy them from VMware and Citrix and Microsoft, and then there’s KVM. We got 4 different implementations. Now we’re in the leverage phase. It’s a well understood concept, we’ve got lots of different implementations, maybe we have to switch implementations occasionally and we’re getting there. Then we got to public cloud, I’m using say AWS or Google, I have no idea. Is it KVM, or it’s Zen I’m told. I have no idea. It’s invisible part of the platform I’m using, there is a VM system there. It’s commoditized out, don’t care anymore. I’m not spending money on virtualization management stuff. It’s just baked into the things I’m using. Think of that kind of cycle, and where we are in things. Innovation Stage Right now, I’d say things like Serverless are in this stage. People are still arguing about Serverless, and what it means, and all these things. It’s a relatively poorly defined concept. Some people have still not heard of it, and what you’re seeing is pioneer adoption. There are definitely people out that doing it, but you can mostly ignore it unless it actually seems to have pushed your buttons and you want to go play with it. That’s kind of where it is right now. I’ve also called Serverless architectures monitoring-less architectures, because we can’t figure out where to install any monitoring agents for it. You’re kind of stuck. There’s a number of places where this has got some really interesting characteristics, we’ll go play with it. That’s a fine thing. Even beyond the innovation stage. What’s the opposite to a microservice? My opposite it a tera-service. You can actually sort of almost, it’s not quite public yet, but both AWS and Azure have multi-terabyte instant sizes coming. They’ve announced them, and they haven’t quite got them out yet. For $14 an hour, you can get a 2-terabyte machine with 128 virtual CPUs running on it. For $14 an hour. I just want to see what people are going to do when they finally get their hands on that thing, because it’s going to be amazing. It’s even harder to find, but Asur has a 3-terabyte one. They were announced around SAP, for the SAP Hana product, which is the new memory system. They are going to be generally available. Think of that as an innovation that’s still out there, hasn’t quite happened yet. I’m just trying to put a label on it, call it terabyte scale services. Forget these tiny little 10 lines of node, I’m trying to figure out how to run a 2-terabyte graph database in memory or something. That’s what I think is interesting at the innovation stage. It’s going to be, maybe next year. In a year’s time there’ll be people talking about these things that they’re able to do, that they weren’t able to do. Leverage Stage [33:14] If you look at the leverage stage, people get the concept. We know we need to do this thing, we pretty much understood it. The terminology is no longer controversial. There’s too many choices. How many different ways are there to schedule a Docker container right now? It’s just ridiculous. Every week there’s another one, probably. You can do it with Cloud Foundry, you can do it with Kubernetes, and Swarm, and Nomad, and Mesos, and I’ve probably forgotten two or three of them. Too many choices, but you’re getting mainstream adoption. This is where you have to be able to continually evolve, because maybe you pick one for now and then another one hits 1.0. Yesterday Mesos hit 1.0. Okay, maybe we should be using Mesos now. People make decisions as things mature. Maybe the best option moves around as they add more features. Eventually, they all end up having the same feature set. There was a Twitter discussion yesterday, because Kubernetes is now going to add frameworks, and Mesos is added pods. Swarm or Nomad, bundled everything into one process. Things are getting to the point where people are kind of figuring out what is the feature set that matters on this platform. You can get it all jammed into one thing, and then it starts to become a commodity. Commodity Stage At the commodity stage, you just stop worrying about it. The point about commodity is there is multiple, compatible implicators. I have a container that needs to run, and they don’t care who is running it for me, they don’t care whether I’m running it under Cloud Foundry with Diego, or I’m running it on Google Container Engine, or Amazon ECS, or on Azure. I just don’t care. That’s the commodity level, and we’re not quite there with container schedulers. I think we’re getting there with platforms now. This is really good to see. This is the SpringOne platform conference. We have Cloud Foundry, and we have the Spring Cloud Spring Boot stuff. It’s just there. If you’re doing Java, there isn’t really anything else out there that’s got this level of support. That’s just going to give you all of this stuff. You don’t need to go build it yourself anymore. You need to build on top of it. You need to go build something interesting that is your product, that is going to be the next generation thing that adds your business value. If you decide you’re going to do a microservices architecture, I published one time a little thing with boxes for every different piece of the architecture. You could spend 2 weeks trying to figure out what to put in each of those boxes, or you could just say let’s just do SpringBoot on Cloud Foundry, and use a bunch of those Netflix projects that got bundled into it, and move on to the discussion. It’s scaffolding. It’s kind of like Ruby on Rails. The rail system is scaffolding so you don’t have to think about this. You can build stuff really quickly, and get on with your life. I think it’s great to see these technologies, that we were pioneering 5 years ago, turn into something that is just now an ubiquitous platform that you can just go use, and build new innovations on top. I’m just really interested to see where this goes. It’s not that the platform stops changing, it’s continuing to evolve. It’s evolving as a commodity with lots of competing implementations, and lots of suppliers, and you’ve got a market here. I’m very encouraged to see that. That’s basically it.

We look at all manner of personal and private information in the full knowledge that some identifying aspects are being stored. Most agree to the storage to keep their internet browsing easy and to keep their services free Thousands Gave Away Personal Data for Free on Facebook - Did You? Thousands Gave Away Personal Data for Free on Facebook - Did You? If you're like thousands of other people, you just gave away a ton of personal information, for a graphic that shows your most-used words on Facebook. Not really a great trade, was it? Read More . But are browsers keeping their end of the deal? Which browsers maintain your inner sanctum, and which are more akin to a desperate, leaky tap? Let’s take a look. What Your Browser Knows about You Your browser maintains a steady stream of personally identifying information Facebook Privacy: 25 Things The Social Network Knows About You Facebook Privacy: 25 Things The Social Network Knows About You Facebook knows a surprising amount about us – information we willingly volunteer. From that information you can be slotted into a demographic, your "likes" recorded and relationships monitored. Here are 25 things Facebook knows about... Read More that can be easily accessed by other websites. The vast majority of the time, you’re being tracked around the web so that those free services we already spend countless hours on can provide vastly more personalized advertising. Your browser will usually provide the following information, without much prodding: Location: The provision of your location seems relatively obvious. Most browsers have a built in geolocation API that websites and other services will use to determine which version of a site to serve to you. In other cases, it’ll determine that the service you’re attempting to use is unavailable at that location, such as BBC iPlayer or Netflix. Most services just want to gauge which country you’re accessing the internet in, and as such you’ll see search results like this: I am nowhere near London. I am, in fact, 311 miles (500km) west of that location, but using a cloud internet service in a bar (yes I am aware I’m in a bar at 9am. Bottomless coffee, anyone?). Geolocation APIs may be able to ask for a location, but they won’t always be accurate, and certainly will not be as accurate as information provided by your smartphone, which has GPS tracking. Hardware and Software: Your browser will provide information about your system hardware and the software you have installed. This is to ensure the website served actually suits your device. As well as this, it will reveal your installed extensions and add-ons so the site or service provider can decide how to interact. Connection: Some websites and services will request your connection information. Again, this is to determine which website content to serve you. Streaming services will use this data to dynamically alter the stream you’re viewing. Social Media: As I’ve already mentioned, your social media accounts will track you around the internet. As the vast majority of social media sites are free, funded by advertising, it is in their owners’ interest to continue this practice. You might not mind being tracked around the web, but it can cause problems. For instance, if you leave Facebook logged in, and head directly to a site offering nefarious wares or adult content, the social media sites will make a log of this. Now, due to their own advertising rules, your screen won’t be emblazoned by naked ladies, or festooned by adverts for your local cannibalism groups — but that log will not disappear. Gyroscope: This only really applies to mobile devices, but your browser still sends this information out even when using a laptop or desktop computer. The only difference is with laptops and desktops certain results will be returned false or null. Interestingly, your browser can (disturbingly?!) assess if your device is currently in hand, or on a table. This information was easily located using What Every Browser Knows About You, a site designed to illustrate the ease that this information can be found. This website is built with this in mind, and does come with a number of useful suggestions as to how you might cover your online tracks just a little more. It isn’t the only webpage you can use to assess what basic information you might be leaking. Try Panopticlick to see if your browser is safe against tracking: Ads by Google As the caption states, the site cannot measure each and every method and variant of tracker. Some are complex, subtle, and in all honestly, don’t want you to know you are being tracked. What makes this site interesting is its browser fingerprint logging. My browser “appears to be unique among the 129,859 tested so far.” Now, 129,859 is a drop in the ocean. Google alone estimate their Chome browser has over 1 billion users. That is 0.0001% of just Chrome users. But it illustrates the ease of identifying individual users via their browsers. Are All Browsers Made the Same? In a word, no. But not necessarily for the reasons you think Chrome vs. Firefox in 2016: Which Browser Is Right For You? Chrome vs. Firefox in 2016: Which Browser Is Right For You?

Read More , Internet Explorer ruled the browser roost, bossing around anyone with ideas about internet access. After schoolyard fights, and bruised egos, Microsoft eventually had to admit that they had somewhat monopolized the market. Somewhat. The answer was to introduce a delightful new screen to the mix, advising users that there were, in-fact, other browsers available, and that Internet Explorer wasn’t god’s (Bill Gates) gift to the world. This, of course, changed things. You see, during the time of Internet Explorer dominance, any nefarious individual who wanted to extrapolate private and personal information from a user would, in many cases, simply find an exploit in Internet Explorer, and do their worst (or best, depending on how you look at it). Being the number one browser throughout the world made Internet Explorer the main target. Roll on a few years and Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Safari, Comodo Dragon, Maxthon, and a host of other browsers (including the new Microsoft Edge) have firm followings throughout the online community. In fact, in April 2016, Google Chrome actually finally overtook Internet Explorer as the most used browser in the entire world, potentially marking the beginning of what I expect to be a very long denouement for an unfortunate stalwart in the history of internet browsers. Depending on where you get your figures from, this may have actually taken place in April 2011, some five years before the information I have linked above. W3Schools, who measure browser statistics and trends each and every month believe this to be the case. Anyway, I digress. Add-ons, Extensions, Plugins, and More The new wave of browsers brought forth a torrent of shiny new add-ons, extensions, plugins, applets, and more, with the aim of streamlining and expanding our internet browsing options. Where Internet Explorer had an extremely limited number of additional browsing options, the new browsers encourage users to download and use these extensions, most of which can be added with a couple of button presses. Their arrival and widespread use created another potential vulnerability. As many extensions require access to the common data we’ve listed above, as well as more personally identifying information, if their security practices aren’t up to scratch regular users can easily see their personal data leaked. Of course, this is exactly what happened. Researchers for anti-scraping and IT security specialists, ScrapeSentry, discovered a free app which was leaking personal information back to single IP address, located in the USA. The Google Chrome extension, Webpage Screenshot, was downloaded by over 1.2 million people and was located after the company “identified an unusual pattern of traffic to one of our client’s sites which alerted our investigators that something was very wrong.” But Browsers Have Other Leaks Aside from the “regular” data provisions requested by the myriad websites we visit, browsers are known to leak all manner of personal data. For instance, in early 2016 security researchers at Canada’s Citizen Lab found the web browser provided by Chinese web-giant Baidu was leaking monumental amounts of information. They concluded that: “[it] collects and transmits a lot of personal user data back to Baidu servers that we believe goes far beyond what should be collected, and it does so either without encryption, or with easily decryptable encryption” The version of the browser developed for Windows systems was found to leak search terms, hard drive serial numbers, network MAC addresses, webpage titles, and even GPU model numbers. As well as this, browser updates arrived without code signatures, meaning they could be hijacked, injected with malicious code, and forced to execute. Furthermore, the browser development kit is used in thousands of applications used around the world, so the issue wasn’t limited to just Chinese users. .@citizenlab researchers find that Baidu browser and several other apps leak a ton of private data. https://t.co/aNMzuuYh0w — Lorenzo Franceschi-B (@lorenzoFB) February 24, 2016 Singling out Baidu isn’t fair.

On numerous occasions over the years the Microsoft-developed browser has been exposed, to varying degrees. In 2014, Internet Explorer users, especially those using XP, were exposed via a memory leak. In 2012 Internet Explorer was subject to a mouse tracking issue which allowed attackers to document mouse movements on vulnerable systems (though Microsoft continually refuted this). Even the newly minted Microsoft Edge browser has experienced personal data leak issues via a poorly coded integrated PDF Reader. Built-in PDF Reader in Windows can leak Edge Browser users datahttps://t.co/4zUZ0kVtHc — Techworm (@Techworm_in) March 4, 2016 Worse than a Leaky Tap It seems our data is consistently up-for-grabs. Tim Libert, a privacy researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, published peer-reviewed research that sought to quantify the numerous privacy comprising features we encounter across the one million most popular websites in the world. “Findings indicate that nearly 9 in 10 websites leak user data to parties of which the user is likely unaware.” To put it plainly, there is a 90% chance the website you just visited will forward your user data to another site.

Related Content Topic :  Chrome  Minimalist open source Web browser Blog :  Google Teams Up with HP Inc. to Make Chromebook Case Is Google Working on Another Operating System? Carl Weinschenk |   Data and Telecom   |   Posted 15 Aug, 2016          |         |     Share It is difficult to keep secrets for long in the computer world. Developers and the media that follow them are brilliant and most of those involved love to puzzle things out. So it is no surprise that just a small posting led to conjecture that Google apparently is planning a third major operating system (OS) to go alongside Chrome OS and Android. Android Police is being given credit for uncovering news of the OS, which at least for now is named Fuchsia. The site found it on the GitHub page, the story says. (GitHub is a site dedicated to Git, a system that controls software development.) Further examination revealed much more about the OS, but the basics are clear. Google products have long been powered by the Linux kernel. However, the story says, this is not ideal for increasingly common embedded systems that power purpose-built devices such as dashboard GPSs. This may be the target of Fuchsia. The idea that Fuchsia is aimed at the embedded market is based on the fact that it uses the Magenta kernel, which can be efficiently used in these applications. Obviously, little is clear. There is no shortage of ideas on the part of Android Police and others, however, as the Android Police story says: So, why? Why is Google quietly developing a brand new OS and kernel, with support for smartphones and PCs, possibly built with Material Design in mind? The most obvious guess, and the most exciting, is that Google hopes to one day replace Chrome OS and Android with Fuchsia. But perhaps Google will treat Fuchsia like Samsung treats Tizen OS; a lightweight OS used on hardware not suited for full-blown Android. Google’s collection of embedded hardware, such as the OnHub router and Google Home, is growing. Perhaps Fuchsia is only being developed for devices like these? Another possibility is that Chrome and Android will continue to be discrete OSs but will move closer under the hood. This possibility is raised by Nick Mediati at Computerworld. He suggests that both would use some form of Fuchsia or the Magenta kernel but retain their own brands, interfaces and features. The two developers named at the GitHub page are Christopher Anderson and Brian Swetland. The latter was quoted as saying that Fuchsia is booting reasonably well on some laptops and PCs. The important inference suggested by the comment is that Fuchsia is potentially aimed at more than just embedded systems. At this point, Fuchsia is a topic of conversation among developers. It may represent a side project for Google, or perhaps a serious initiative that will be put aside. There is also the possibility that the project will grow to significantly affect the broad world of Google’s operating systems. Carl Weinschenk covers telecom for IT Business Edge.

Now everything from routers to cars to phones to security cams are getting hacked, with hackable refrigerators on the horizon. Android and Windows are still the only operating systems which seem sure to have been compromised tens of millions of times, but it's inevitable that they will have company before long. Will it come in the form of a malicious patch to wirelessly updating car OSes? I really hope not, but you never know. If they can write in a high level of security from scratch, it will fill a definite need, regardless of its intended use. As the situation stands right now, I like having an old car with no accessible computer on board. I like not having any Internet of Things hardware. I use computers, tablets and phones, but never use the smaller gizmos for anything important, like connecting them to my *real* email address, or going to financial sites with them. And if the NSA wants to be in my computer, they are. Any kind of secure OS would be great. Reply Please enable Javascript in your browser, before you post the comment! Now Javascript is disabled.

Uber will launch a fleet of human-supervised self-driving Volvo SUVs in Pittsburgh later this month, and Ford plans to have autonomous cars ready for hailing by 2021. But Uber, who has raced to be first to market, isn’t just seizing opportunity for self-driving passenger vehicles. Today, the company announced that it has acquired Otto, a self-driving big-rig truck company. Otto creates kits that can be installed in freight vehicles to make them drive autonomously, with minimal human intervention. Ex-Googlers Anthony Levandowski and Lior Ron founded Otto in January of this year. Ron was previously product head for Google Maps as well as Motorola. Levandowski led the development of Google’s first self-driving car and has pioneered self-driving technology throughout his career. Related: Entrepreneurs Are Working to Uber-fy the Trucking Industry Last month, Entrepreneur sat down with Ron to learn about how his background led him to found Otto and get a glimpse of what an autonomous trucking future might look like. Why did you decide to found Otto and focus on self-driving trucks? Anthony and me have known each other for the past almost decade. We came together and realized, there’s no other technology that excites us more and has more promise to impact society and benefit society in the next couple of years. It really has the potential to reshape how cities are built, reshape how transportation is made, to reshape many of the issues that we have in society today, from safety to environment to productivity. We started talking about the future of self-driving and what can we do to accelerate the future and reap some of those societal benefits sooner than later. And we realized that while there was so much activity going on on the passenger side and all of those great minds and projects, including Google, there wasn’t a lot of attention being given to something as important as that, which is commercial transportation, and how we move goods, not just people. And if you think about that, really, moving goods is the backbone of economy. Everything around us, except us, was on a truck at some point, at some time. A truck touched it. Seventy percent of all of the cargo in the U.S. is being moved by trucks. We all live in an on-demand era, and there are more and more demands on the shipping and logistical network of the U.S., but just not enough supply of truck drivers, of capacity, in freight. By showing we can deploy autonomy and technology in this market, we hope that will unlock a lot of the societal challenges and opportunities, the regulations, public adoption and comfort with the technology. The challenge of bringing the technology to market is not just a technological challenge. It’s also a business, product challenge, of how can we constrain the problem for something that can be solved in the foreseeable future. The nice thing about the logistics and commercial transportation market is, if we can constrain the market to really be around highways, and on highways exit to exit, that’s 95 percent of the commercial transportation in the U.S. How did your background lead you to Google and, ultimately, Otto? I came to Google after business school at Stanford. And before that, I had the pleasure of serving seven years in the Israeli military. As part of that, at a very young age, I was given a lot of responsibilities and a lot of opportunities around building an applied technology to solve intelligence problems. It had to do with knowledge, and machine learning and GIS systems. So that’s where I got my love for geography and geo-information systems and applying data at scale to solve a problem. Google Maps was a natural transition for me to really take all of that understanding of how those technologies happen in a more closed setting in the military and apply them in a much wider scale with consumers. I joined Google Maps in 2007, the very early days. It was really a very special time, because it was a small team, and we had basically an unlimited opportunity in front of us to really map the world and build the most precise, most advanced, most comprehensive map of the universe. Anthony joined Google after his startup was acquired. He helped kickstart and accelerate the Streetview development in technology. We did a lot of work on how to entice users to contribute and enhance the map. That was all Map 1.0, I would call it. We built Google Maps, we scaled it from a couple of million users to over a billion users in the course of those five years. Then Map 2.0 is really taking that to the next level and really moves to a more real-time nature of the map. As you move to real-time, you really have to have more of a user contribution, because things are dynamic. I would call Waze, which I was helpful in integrating to Google, probably the best example of that Map 2.0 wave. And really, self-driving vehicles are Map 3.0, which is a highly accurate, super dynamic, real-time, super high-detailed representation of the world around us, which requires new sensors and new way of thinking about how to build the map. Anthony was always more on sort of the robotic, self-driving side. He also, essentially, was involved in starting the self-driving car project at Google and one of the founding team members. We just had a great partnership along the years. And it’s time to take that vision of deploying autonomy to society in other spaces and start doing that. Otto co-founders Lior Ron and Anthony Levandowski. Image credit: Otto We both left Google in January to start Otto. We started with two of us in a house in Palo Alto with a truck, and fast forward five or six months after, we have over 70 people in a nice, big warehouse in San Francisco. We have four trucks driving 24/7 on the highways. They’re mostly driving in California, but in other states, such as Nevada, the ability to test completely driverless with complete autonomy is a bit easier. We’re in the process of starting to test and drive in more states. And you two self-funded Otto from the start. There’s a lot of advice on how to bootstrap businesses. We are just fortunate to be successful in our careers so we can afford to bootstrap, but bootstrapping gives you wings, and gives you freedom and gives you flexibility of how you want to build the business, and how fast you want to move and what culture you want to build early on. We were able and fortunate to use that self-funding to move very fast and hire a team very fast without stopping to raise outside capital. We were able to grow the team from two of us in a small garage in Palo Alto to over 70 people in San Francisco. A big group followed us from Google. A group of Apple engineers that were excited and left Apple to join us. A couple of key engineers from Tesla. The flexibility allowed us to be faster and move faster and create a lot of options for us of how we wanted to carry the business forward, talk with partners and build the company. I highly recommend it if you can afford it and you have the confidence in the business to build. Right now you’re really focused on highway trucks, but do you foresee applying your self-driving kits to other types of vehicles involved in the shipping and distribution industry? The kit choice is part of that accelerating the future, and how can we bring the technology to market as fast as possible. The way to do that is by taking existing trucks and not waiting for a very long cycle of replacing the entire fleet. Of the 2 million long-haul trucks in the U.S. today, it takes almost five years for a big fleet to replace the trucks, and then the truck stays on the road for another five, six years with smaller fleets. Those engines can run a million miles, which means 10, 11 years of livelihood on the roads. So, we really wanted to bring that change as soon as we can. And to do that, the best way is to build an aftermarket kit. So that’s what we’re focused on. The other benefit of the kit is, in terms of time, in terms of cost, you don’t have to buy a completely new vehicle. You can just take your existing investment and convert it into a much more productive, much safer truck by deploying the kit. And it allows us to test and deploy much faster. The same approach could be applied to other types of vehicles as well, whether it’s cars, or agriculture, like tractors, or a host of other vehicles. We’re just very focused on commercial transportation and trucking. It’s a big enough problem and space for us to try and change and solve. In the passenger market, it’s really about minimizing the cost and trying to do a lot of things that would fit our appetite as consumers and our willingness to spend on that new technology. There are a lot of commonalities, but there are also many differences between those markets. How much do the kits cost? We don’t have a specific price point in mind. It’s too early. We’ve mentioned, I think, in passing, some example number, but really, at scale, that technology shouldn’t cost anything close to the cost of the truck. So a truck would cost today, a new Volvo truck, off the lot, with all of the amenities and latest-and-greatest, like, $160,000. We really aim for the price point to be affordable because we want to drive that future and see those societal benefits unlocked as soon as possible. We’re starting with an aftermarket kit, but there’s no reason not to integrate that into vehicles leaving the production line, so new trucks come equipped with the technology from day one. Have you thought about a separate lane, or other kinds of infrastructural changes -- or limitations on this -- if it really proliferates? Would this technology enable more trucks to be on the road? The future is exciting! I don’t have a crystal ball on the future, but I know it’s going to be different. The drivers are going be in the cabin for the foreseeable future. We’re not trying to replace them. They’re basically getting a co-pilot, and they’re elevated from having to be in the loop 24/7 to really just be like a pilot, where 99 percent of the "flight" is being done by the computer, and the driver, or the "pilot" is there to just lift off and land. The driver is still there, but he can sleep a little bit while the computer is basically driving on the vast, thousands of miles of empty highway. Image credit: Otto So that’s really what we’re aiming for, and when we get to that, then a lot of new opportunities arise. You can route those trucks very efficiently. You can be thoughtful about combining loads more effectively to get the number of trucks smaller, not bigger, because there’s more predictability of where those trucks are. You can start driving at night and use the nighttime, which is mostly empty now, because truck drivers try to maintain sleeping patterns, and they prefer to drive during the day. And potentially, rather than those folks having to be away from home 300 days a year, they can really see their family much more because they can complete the same route more than double as fast because the robot is doing more of the driving for them, which means they can get to the destination and back much faster and actually have the ability to build a local family. You can think about different ways to deploy distribution centers. Right now, distribution centers are being built very close to the destination. But you can think about building bigger distribution centers in farther away places, because you can get to places faster. Stepping back, innovations in transportation have always been, for me, about finding time and space. It’s like a Star Trek-like warp-hole "engage" button. Because every time you redefine basic transportation, you redefine space and time. When the car was invented, it was really the predicament to start expanding cities. When there became common households, that was really the start of suburban communities. When flights and the plane were invented, it redefined geography. Same here, applied to commercial transportation. Once that network is in place, our whole definition of what it means to ship goods, how to do that is going to be completely transformed. What types of partnerships are in store? Shippers are interested in shipping more goods on the road and making their fleets safer and more sustainable. We can drive trucks in a much more thoughtful way. We don’t have to constantly accelerate or decelerate. We can move in the same route at the same constant speed, controlled by the computer, which means less pollution and a much more sustainable footprint. Trucking companies are excited for the same reason, OEMs [original equipment manufactures] are excited about the potential to embed the technology into the vehicles. Related: Never Fear, Uber Is Here! Crime and Fatal Accident Rates Fall Since Company Launch. There have been a lot of discussions of how to apply the technology in the real world, that’s what I’m psyched about as a business and product leader, is how can we take technology and really use it to transform society. We see that transformation happening now by talking with shippers on how to integrate that into the logistical network, by talking with couriers about how this will impact and change their business, so that has been very refreshing. What do you have to do to convince truck operators to adopt this technology? In theory, it may sound like a great idea, but what are some of the concerns that they have? I would say, at large, everyone in the industry that we spoke with is very excited by the promise. They see, day in and day out, the issues and challenges that we’re trying to solve. Everything from safety on the roads, which manifests for them in costs. There are thousands of unnecessary fatalities. Maybe 1 percent of the vehicles in the U.S. are trucks, and they’re driving 5 percent of the miles and they’re responsible for 10 percent of the fatalities. So they experience more and more and more demand, which, in turn, translates to more and more and more pressure on those truck drivers to drive longer and longer and longer. And they’re craving for a safer solution that will allow them to fulfill that demand while still being safe. They see the productivity issues of basically having a fleet of trucks laying around only driving nine, 10 hours a day, because that’s the limit of the truck driver. Because after that, every additional 30 minutes doubles the chance of accident. That’s just our ability to stay attentive as humans. So they see the potential to utilize their assets, their trucks, much better. We got super positive response from everyone, from the big shippers, to the big trucking fleets, to the medium ones and even the small, what’s called owner-operator, which is basically a mom-and-pop shop, owning like one, two, five trucks. They’re excited to equip their trucks with the self-driving kits so they can, again, be more productive and drive almost more than double what they’re driving today, and be twice as productive and have twice as much revenue per truck. So we’ve gotten hundreds of emails and letters and support from, even just single truck drivers, eager to get the safety technology on their trucks. That being said, the challenge is, first and foremost, seeing is believing. I think we as people, many times, are fearful of the unknown, and it sounds great, as you said, in theory, but in practice, people really want to touch it, sense it, feel it, understand what it is. And I think the more we can collaborate with partners and test in more and more states, and really have as many people understand the technology, experience it, see one of our self-driving trucks on the highway, slowly but surely, people will start feeling more and more comfortable with the technology. In your video, the truck has the Otto logo on it and imagery. Is that something that you foresee, it being a brand and the trucks being branded? We are very thoughtful about the brand. We wanted the brand to stand for technology, for innovation, for the brave new world for automobiles -- "auto, Otto." We see that as an integral part of the story, not just, "Here’s the technology, good luck." It’s, "Here is a new way to think about commercial transportation." So the brand is front and center. Image credit: Otto There are many ways to then define and express in the market. Could be Otto trucks, could be partner trucks powered by Otto. The brand is gonna be there, we’re excited about the name, we’re excited about the meaning, we’re excited about the reception and the visibility. We want the other inhabitants of the highway to know there’s an automated truck driving. We want them to understand what it means, so part of the name and brand is also important just for the product on its own, to communicate what it stands for and how it’s gonna behave. Anything else you’d like to add? From an entrepreneur perspective, I would say two things: I was just fortunate to get my basic education in how to use technology to disrupt problems in the military, then be able to apply that at scale on Google Maps and really think about how to get technology into the world as sort of a network problem: Maps, self-driving. At Motorola, I learned the joys and wonders of building physical objects and how can that transform our world and lives, and to not be afraid of constraining myself to just software, but also having the appetite to build physical stuff. All of those paths led me to take on this challenge, and that has been a joy. I encourage entrepreneurs to really aim for the moon. The amount of effort you put into going and doing something very ambitious, vs. opening a grocery shop is the same. You have to be a laser-focused on the problem you’re solving, you have to build your customer base, you have to develop your differentiator, you have to raise capital. It still applies. So I encourage people that they might as well try and solve some of the societal problems that we face. Related: VCs Share 3 Secrets for Mastering Any Niche The Valley and technology has its ways. Lots of entrepreneurs tend to do stuff that they know, which them leads them to choose the 100th company to do the same thing in a slightly different flavor, a slightly different take. I encourage people to go out of their comfort zone, and really to step back and think, from a societal perspective, "How can I lend my skills against a problem that really needs to be solved and will have a major impact?" vs. "How can I lend my skills to something that I might be slightly more familiar with but doesn’t really move the needle in the grand scheme of things?” Learn a new domain. Whether it’s maps or mobile handsets and the mobile industry or the truck industry, disruption always happens from the outside. You don’t have to have 20 years of trucking experience to be able to help and provide value in the trucking industry. Go out of your comfort zone and seek opportunities to really bring innovation to new things. This interview has been edited. Lydia Belanger Lydia Belanger is an associate editor at Entrepreneur.com.

Don't leave your system open to attack. Blog :  CSA Trials SaaS App for Assessing Cloud Security Article :  Gain More Control of BYOD Apps with an Enterprise App Store Autonomous Vehicles and Hacking Carl Weinschenk |   Data and Telecom   |   Posted 22 Jul, 2016          |         |     Share Cameron Camp, a researcher for global security provider ESET, suggests that autonomous vehicles are very vulnerable to hacking. These vehicles typically use a Controller Area Network (CAN), a simple and reliable way to link all the elements necessary in a connected car. The problem is that it’s vulnerable, Camp says at Dark Reading: The basic flaw in autonomous vehicles is the vulnerability that results from all systems being interconnected. The Controller Area Network, or CAN bus, runs the important things in a car like engine and transmission controls, as well as the system you’ll interact most with: the infotainment computer on your dashboard. The infotainment system is often tied to the internet to enable you to get directions. If the infotainment system intersects both the CAN bus and the internet, suddenly over-the-air hacks become more of a reality if the bus is left unsecured. This is the most worrisome repercussion of connected car hacking -- possibly affecting your vehicle unbeknownst to you while you drive down the road. Camp suggests that CANs need a deep security overhaul “using the lessons learned from every other commercial network in the world over the past five years.” Google Fiber Halts in Portland Google Fiber is delaying the buildout of its service in Portland by at least several months, according to Oregon Live. Google Fiber has been considering Portland since 2014. It released a statement that included no firm date to start the project. Commentary suggests that the company may be trying to find a way to cut the cost of the project. The city estimates the price tag will be $300 million. The good (if not surprising) news for residents is that broadband speeds have gone up in the two-and-a-half years since Google Fiber first expressed interest. Tennesseans Skipping Fastest Broadband It almost goes without saying that people want the fastest broadband that they can get their hands on. Well, that may not always be the case. The Times Free Press looks at a study sponsored by the Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development, in which researchers found that fewer than 25 percent of Tennessee residents subscribe to high-speed broadband, though it is available to 87 percent of residents. Thirteen percent of residents don’t have broadband access, which equates to 834,545 people. A majority of the others, those that have access, prefer digital subscriber line (DSL), wireless or dial-up. The study, which was conducted by the Strategic Networks Group, revealed a significant digital divide. One in six people in the state can access 1 gigabit per second (Gbps) service – if they choose to pay for it. Updating Pen Testing Penetration testing, also known as pen testing, is the strategy of increasing security by attacking the organization in the same way that a malicious hacker would. The goal is to identify and fix vulnerabilities before they are found and exploited by the bad guy. At Continuity Central, SureCloud’s Toby Scott-Jackson takes a look at how the penetration testing strategy must change, especially in the age of the Internet of Things (IoT). Two of his points: Technology is changing quickly, and threats and adversaries are growing more sophisticated. Those planning pen testing should emphasize flexibility and adopt a “pen test-as-a-service” approach that makes it possible to run the tests more frequently: Technology, security and cybercriminals are all continually evolving – which means that the traditional, annual or biannual penetration test is no longer an option. With more regular check-ups on the security of their networks and applications via a platform-based approach, organizations will gain a better understanding of their business risk, and move to the next stage in the evolution of their organizations’ security. Combining Augmented and Virtual Realities Augmented reality and virtual reality (AR and VR) have significant similarities and differences. While the two are often lumped together, they have been on discreet tracks during their evolutionary paths. That may be changing. Digital Trends reports on rumors, which started with information provided to Engadget, that Google is working on a device that “blurs the line” between AR and VR. The headset would be viable for both real-world and virtual experience; it won’t need a computer or phone, but will have a screen and “offer more augmented reality features than current VR headsets can provide,” according to Digital Trends.

There is significant turmoil at Alphabet's "other bets" division. Should investors be worried? Andrés Cardenal (TMFacardenal) Aug 18, 2016 at 1:18PM Image source: Getty Images. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) lost three key executives in its other bets business division over the past few months. Should this be interpreted as a sign of turmoil and uncertainty? To what degree should investors be worried?   Goodbye, Alphabet Alphabet (the company formerly known as Google) changed its name and corporate structure last year. Alphabet now includes both Google and the other bets division, which is a collection of businesses and projects in highly innovative areas. It includes self-driving cars, home connectivity, high-speed internet, and futuristic healthcare ventures, among other projects. The other bets segment is going through major changes at the top. Bill Maris, founder and CEO of GV (formerly named Google Ventures), is leaving the company. Marris will reportedly be replaced by David Krane, a managing partner for the venture capital arm at Google. This is not an isolated event: Chris Umson, chief technologhy officer at Alphabet's self-driving car project left the company in August. Umson was followed out the door by Jiajun Zhu, the team's principal software engineer and one of its founders, and also by Dave Ferguson, another software lead in the self-driving car unit. Alphabet purchased smart home products company Nest Labs for $3.2 billion in 2014, and things haven't worked out as expected since then. Nest Labs missed its sales targets in 2015, and several executives departed the company over the last couple of years. Finally, Tony Fadell, Nest Labs' founder, was replaced as CEO by Marwan Fawaz, who used to be an executive at Motorola Mobility, in June.  Since many of these projects are kept secret, it's hard to determine what exactly is going on at Alphabet's other bets segment. That said, the fact that several top executives are leaving the company is hardly a reason for optimism. CEOs don't usually leave a company when the business is thriving and future prospects look promising. What this means for investors in Alphabet The company's other bets division is an eclectic collection of projects in different areas. However, they share a key characteristic: Most of these initiatives have limited commercial viability in the short term, and they are consuming capital while operating in the red. In fact, one of the main reasons Alphabet decided to change its corporate structure in 2015 was to better reflect on its current business model and strategy. Google is a massively profitable business thanks to its leadership position in online advertising. The other bets division is a different story in terms of its financial contribution to Alphabet as a whole.  The following table offers some statistics obtained from Alphabet's financial report for the second quarter of 2016.  Metric Q2 2015 Q2 2016 Growth (YOY) Google revenue $17,653 $21,315 20.7% Google operating profit $5,608 $6,994  24.7% Google operating margin 31.8% 32.8% 3.2%  Other bets revenue $74 $185 150% Other bets operating profit ($660) ($859)  -30.2% Data in millions of dollars. Data Source: SEC filings.   Even if it's growing rapidly, the other bets segment accounts for less than 1% of total revenue, and it's currently dragging on overall profitability. These initiatives could offer intriguing potential for growth and innovation over the long term, but they are not generating a lot of value for investors right now. In fact, if Alphabet is going to reduce its spending in other bets, this could even have a positive impact on the company's overall earnings over the midterm. The fact that several important executives at Alphabet's other bets division are leaving likely indicates that these projects are not performing as expected, or at least that Alphabet considers that these companies have significant room for improvement under a new leadership. This seems to mean that the money that Alphabet has allocated to these ventures is producing disappointing results, which is clearly bad news for investors. However, Google is far more important to Alphabet investors than other bets, and the online advertising juggernaut is producing impressive performance when it comes to both sales and earnings. Management turnover is a relevant factor to watch going forward, but Alphabet remains a remarkably solid business thanks to Google, no matter what happens at other bets.   Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   Google to world: Help us learn to talk to you By Patrick May / August 18, 2016 at 10:51 AM Like it or not, and apparently more and more of us like it, we’ll be spending much of our waking moments in the future talking to machines. Apple’s digital assistant, Siri, and I have been on a first-name basis now for quite a while. And unless I’m imagining things, Siri seems increasingly to understand exactly what I’m saying to her. Him? Whatever. Siri just, well, Siri gets me. So does Google Now, the search giant’s decidedly deft virtual assistant. In fact, at times I think Now gets me even more than Siri gets me. Google Now is now going to gain an even better understanding of what we’re all saying, thanks to a new campaign by Google to make sense of English accents, including Scottish, Australian and Indian. Working with the social network Reddit, Google is reaching out to the world to help Now learn to talk, and listen, better. Google, which announced last summer that it had reduced voice transcription errors by up to 49 percent, now wants to focus on the accented English speakers out there, and it’s recruiting accented Reddit users to help out by speaking up. Business Insider reported that while interested Redditors will be paid a decent wage for lending their voices online, they’ll also have to earn it: The work in whole is fairly involved, apparently — participants are required to recite 2,000 individual phrases over the course of three hours — but rewarded generously in cold, hard cash. Adults earn 27 pounds ($36), and kids under 16 earn slightly less — 20 pounds ($26) — but they read from a shorter, 45-minute script of 500 phrases. Bloggers have noticed that Google seems to be particularly keen on coming to grips with the Scottish accent, which apparently is a challenging inflection for virtual assistants like Siri and Now to master. Surprised? Check out this voice coach’s take on mastering the Scottish dialect: Ads on Reddit’s site lay out what’s required of participants willing to help Google improve its voice-recognition chops. One query read: “I’m currently recruiting to collect … data for Google. It requires you to use an Android to complete the task. The task is recording voice prompts like ‘Indy now,’ [and] ‘Google what’s the time.’ Each phrase takes around 3-5 seconds.” The Verge spoke with several Redditors who had signed up for the job: There were regional accents from the UK and America, as well as Indian and Chinese-accented English, with most users saying they’d had difficulty with tech like Siri and Alexa in the past. All said they went through the same process of being directed to a mobile webpage where there was a record button to tap, and a number of phrases to read out. The post in the Verge said the participants were asked to repeat phrases directed to Google (“OK Google”  and “Hey, Google” for example),” but some just asked for the names of popular TV shows, toys, and video game (including a number of YouTube channels, like Sky Does Minecraft). Others spanned a range of typical Google searches, including hunting for recipes.” In other words, the day is quickly approaching when you can look up that recipe for duck a l’orange and use your best Sir Sean Connery to do it.

When you clicked on the Google Docs looking button it took you to a Google login page (same as you would see with Google Docs). If you put in your credentials hackers would have access to your account.  I tested this with one of my throwaway gmail accounts and it told me password invalid.  In fact no matter what I put in it said invalid password. This is a slick trick hackers use because they not only have your email but now they have every password you think you would use…. This is incredibly valuable data (and sold frequently on the darkweb) because now they can mass attempt to log into bank accounts, social media accounts, and anything else you can imagine. A few hours later a “Caution” email was sent out by Udemy Director – Veronica Spindler, saying her account was hacked. This was a VERY bad and irresponsible response by Udemy because…  Well see below as I will explain. This is the most irresponsible… or incompetent response from a company that was hacked then I have ever seen for several different reasons: Using the word caution in the subject? caution is in understatement.  How about *IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED. Companies get hacked.  It will happen eventually… but companies encrypt passwords, plus this is an easy fix because you can force people to change password on next login (after notifying them), this is MUCH more serious. Really they say YOU MAY WANT TO CONSIDER changing passwords if you use the same one other places?  Really? You may want to consider?  wtf??? The bullshit thing about checking your Google account to see if someone logged in from another device… obviously they never even really dove into this or they would know it never even logged into Google. No explanation of exactly your risks… 3 days until you notify your users? Really? You can bet your data has been sold six ways to sunday on the darkweb. Unbelieveable. If you fell for this change every password. Don’t “consider” it like Udemy suggests. I saw on TechCrunch they just raised another 60M.  They are going to need it if they are found culpable in legal action from users.

This is actually a pretty interesting software, and not like traditional email clients. It lets you open the web interface of Gmail with all the web features, like, Hangouts, labels, etc. But what makes it even better is that it lets you add multiple Gmail accounts, and access all of the in same interface, without a need to keeping multiple browser tabs open. There are some other similar software (like GMailS and GeeMail), but they don’t let you add multiple Google Accounts. This software lets you add multiple accounts of Google Inbox and Gmail and use them directly from its interface. It’s really easy to switch between accounts and use them. Whatever you can do using the web clients of Gmail and Google Inbox can also be done from the interface of this software. You can compose an email, use hangouts, create reminders when using Google Inbox, etc. Sponsored Links Above screenshot shows Gmail account on its interface. In the screenshot below, you can see a Google Inbox account. So, its interface adapts itself based on the type of account. Apart from these basic options, the software has a couple of interesting features too. It shows the total number of unread messages on its system tray icon. This will help you check how many messages are waiting for your attention. Apart from that, desktop notifications also come for new messages. Moreover, the software supports file drag n drop option (when you need to add a file in the compose box) and keyboard shortcuts to easily operate it. So, if you are looking for a change and need some good desktop client for Gmail and Google Inbox, this software can be handy. This software is also available for Linux and Mac. Using This Free Desktop Client for Gmail and Google Inbox: This desktop client for Gmail and Google Inbox is very easy to use. Here is the homepage link of this software. Install it and launch the UI. It will prompt you to add your Gmail or Google Inbox account. After adding an account, it will start collecting all the emails and will show the total number of unread messages in the system tray icon. When a new message will arrive, it will show pop-up notification also. Now you can view emails on its interface and take actions. To add more accounts, you can use “+” icon available in the left sidebar. All the added accounts are also visible in this sidebar. This will help you to switch between accounts. Just click on a particular account and then you can use that account. You can also adjust a couple of options by accessing Settings. Use Gear icon visible in the sidebar and then you can: Enable/disable built-in spell checker. Show/hide system tray icon. Show/hide unread badge icon, etc. Adjust the settings to let this software perform as per your liking. The Verdict: Wmail is a good software if you use multiple Gmail or Google Inbox accounts. It takes away the hassle of using multiple browser tabs. Also, the fact that it provides the completely web interface of Gmail means that you don’t need to loose out on some of the essential Gmail features (like labels, filters) that traditional email clients loose.

I’ve been using my beloved POP Peeper Pro for many years to aggregate my many webmail and private domains’ email accounts but, in doing so, lost many features (like search) present in the web interfaces. This WMail looks really promising, especially if the developer adds other than Google-related providers, IMAP and a few other bells and whistles that, based on GitHub, he is currently working on.

Code-named Knights Mill, the next processor in the Xeon Phi family is expected to be available in 2017, the company said Wednesday. Diane Bryant, executive VP and general manager of Intel’s Data Center Group, made the announcement at the Intel Developers Forum in San Francisco. As tech giants like Google, Facebook, and Microsoft, as well as Elon Musk’s non-profit OpenAI, are investing enormous sums of money in AI research, fighting tooth-and-nail to attract top minds in the field, a battle to supply hardware for the software those minds will create is nascent. In this battle, Intel is up against the likes of Nvidia, whose GPUs are a popular way to deploy algorithms for machine learning (a common type of AI technology), and the tech giants themselves. Google has developed a custom processor for its machine learning applications on its own, saying nothing was available on the market that met its performance and price requirements. Read more: Google Has Built Its Own Custom Chip for AI Servers Intel has a different set of concerns than Google does when designing its processors for machine learning. It wants to create a general-purpose chip that will support machine learning and other workloads, Charles Wuischpard, VP of the Data Center Group, said on a call with reporters in June, which was the first time the company discussed its AI chip strategy publicly. While he had little familiarity with Google’s Tensor Processing Unit, Wuischpard said it appeared to be a highly specialized part designed for a specific workload. Another big part of Intel’s AI chip strategy is to make it scale out rather than up. The latter is the most common architecture for machine learning, he said, which makes it difficult to scale. Knights Mill “is optimized for scale-out analytics implementations, and will include key enhancements for deep learning training,” Intel said in a statement Wednesday.

The company announced Thursday that it's now possible to bring functionality from apps like Scanbot, DocuSign, and ProsperWorks into Docs and Sheets on its mobile operating system. The third-party add-ons will let users do things like access CRM data, start to electronically sign a document, and create mobile apps based on data they have stored in a spreadsheet. The new add-ons are aimed at making it easier for people to get work done within Google Docs and Sheets while they're on the go. Google is in tight competition with Microsoft to attract users to its productivity suite, and both companies are working to bring the power of third-party applications into the apps people already use to get things done. A small set of add-ons is available now from a hand-picked set of Google partners. In the future, developers will be able to build their own add-ons, and submit them to Google for review. If the company deems them worthy, it'll allow them to integrate with Docs and Sheets. The functionality builds on existing partner integrations available for Google's productivity software on the web. Those existing integrations have been available for users accessing the services from their computers. Users can find the add-ons in the add-ons sections of the Google Docs and Sheets apps, as well as in special collections inside the Google Play Store. It's not yet clear what the future holds for add-ons beyond Android.

A Russian court rejected Google's appeal of a lower court finding in an antitrust case involving the company's Android bundling practices. The decision by Moscow's Ninth Arbitration Court of Appeal leaves intact a judgment by the country's Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) earlier this month ordering Google to pay a fine of $6.7 million and to change its Android installation requirements in Russia. Russian news service Tass reported on the development this week. It quoted the head of FAS as expressing satisfaction with the appeals court's decision and expressing hope that Google would comply in full with the judgment entered against it. Google did not respond immediately to a request for comment. So it is unclear what the company's next move will be and whether it will pay the fine or change its Android business practices in Russia. The dispute stems from a complaint filed last year by Russian search engine and internet firm Yandex, which claimed it was being unfairly deprived of an opportunity to have its mobile applications installed on Android handsets because of Google. According to the company, a Google requirement that Android device manufacturers who pre-install Google Play on their devices also must install Google Search, Google Maps and other applications effectively blocked others from having their applications on the same devices. After a months-long investigation, the FAS, Russia's enforcer of anti-monopoly laws, ruled last October that Google's bundling practices violated Russian laws and ordered the company to change them. The $6.7 million fine, Google's subsequent appeal of that decision and the appellate court’s rejection of that appeal this week all stem from that FAS judgment last year. For Google, the latest development, while not surprising—this is the second time the Moscow Arbitration Court has rejected a Google appeal in the case—is likely troubling. The company faces scrutiny over the same Android bundling issue in at least two other places. European Union Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager earlier this year announced that her office had launched a formal investigation to see whether the Android bundling requirement is, in fact, unfair. Just last week, South Korea's Fair Trade Commission said that it too had opened an inquiry into Google's application-bundling practices. Google has maintained its practices are consistent with local laws in all the countries in which it operates. So far at least, despite a few unfavorable verdicts like the one in Moscow this week, the company appears to have done little to change its business practices in a major way in response to such disputes. However, in a few instances, Google has acquiesced to certain demands. In the United Kingdom, for example, the company agreed to pay the equivalent of nearly $170 million to settle claims that it had avoided paying its fair share of taxes on revenue earned there. Similarly, in the European Union, the company earlier this year agreed to apply the Right to be Forgotten mandate more broadly after months of stubbornly refusing to budge on the issue.           LATEST CLOUD ARTICLES   New Tool Shines Light on $5 Billion Web Traffic Fraud Racket Microsoft's Azure Advisor Helps Customers Float Cloud Applications Early Stage Startup Heptio Aims to Make Kubernetes Friendly Google, Intel to Collaborate on Cloud, IoT Technolgies Social Media Sites Take Risks When Blocking Speech They Don't Like                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

Since last winter, the Munich-based company has been powering Google hotel scores for search and maps where TrustYou finds a match between its hotel database and Google’s hotel database — that’s about 300,000 hotels. (When there isn’t a match, Google shows its Google Score.)* Update: Aug. 18: This article has been updated with corrections to some of the nuances of the TrustYou Stars platform and the Google partnership. A few quotes and the headline (“…and it isn’t afraid of TripAdvisor”) have been clarified to prevent a possibly misleading impression that TrustYou is competing with TripAdvisor when, in fact, it is a pure B2B play that styles itself “the Switzerland of reviews” and is a great partner with TripAdvisor when it comes to its reputation management software. TrustYou says that, for hotels that have begun to use its TrustYou Stars platform, which rolled out this year, on average, 75% of new hotel reviews on Google now come via the platform. The Stars tool expands the volume and reach of the hotel review data which can be seen on Google, Kayak, Skyscanner, and Wego. The company’s software also identifies review content from Expedia Inc and Priceline Group brands and analyzes that data, too. It mainly only excludes reviews from TripAdvisor, the user-reviews giant. Looking ahead, TrustYou thinks it can thrive, despite competition from rival reputation management companies, such as Revinate and ReviewPro, and guest survey companies like Medallia. Earlier this summer, TrustYou acquired Checkmate, a real-time messaging specialist for hotels to communicate with guests, for an undisclosed sum. We recently checked in with Benjamin Jost, chief executive and co-founder of TrustYou, to find out how his company plans to ride an expected wave of hotel investment in online reputation management. Jost outlined his belief that Google and other players will increasingly challenge TripAdvisor’s dominance in reviews. The interview has been edited for brevity and clarity. Tnooz: Nothing personal, but hotel general managers, when they proverbially wake up at three o’clock in the morning, they’re worried about their TripAdvisor score, not their TrustYou score. Is TrustYou just never going to be able to compete with the giant that is TripAdvisor? Jost: TripAdvisor has built a great brand. No one competes with that overnight. With more and more eyeballs on our data, especially with the launch on Google, we do see more and more hotels caring about the TrustScore, too. I would say we just started with the past year, when the Google deal actually launched. Separately, we are great partners with TripAdvisor when it comes to our reputation management software, where we license their review data. We do show TripAdvisor ratings and reviews to hotels, because hotels NEED to see that and respond to that. Tnooz: Every hotel seems to have a sticker saying it is rated on TripAdvisor. TrustYou for years had has a quality symbol, but not as many hotels tell guests about that. Is TrustYou going to be stuck in second place next to TripAdvisor? Jost: No. As an analogy, take J.D. Power, which does customer satisfaction surveys in the States. It’s an example of where you have a third-party, non-competing brand, very popular amongst users because it’s trustworthy, and it becomes more and more popular. It’s not competing with anyone. We have a good chance of being a kind of J.D. Power for the travel industry. We’ve seen other industries have a player like that rise up. Why not in travel? TripAdvisor is, to a certain extent, at cross-purposes with the hotels in how it markets its metasearch tool and mobile app as a consumer entry point. I’m not judging. But because TrustYou is not competing for consumer attention, we’re a very, very easy choice for hotels… We can show that if you improve your score, you increase conversion on these metasearch sites. There’s a payoff to the investment. Plus, we offer a product tuned to hotel needs. To get technical, we give them control. A hotel can take our data and say, “I want to display my entire ranking relative to all hotels in my city. Or just based on the best-ranked family hotels. Or, I want to rank it on the best boutique hotels. Or I want a ranking on the hotels with the best bar.” We’re not competing with anyone… That’s a different positioning. Tnooz: How will the reputation management landscape look three or five years from now? Jost: Ideally, every hotel will use our services when it comes to guest feedback, for collecting and analyzing it. That means putting guest feedback on their own brand.com site and app, for instance, with our tools. Tnooz: The mix of unverified and verified reviews on TripAdvisor still seems to have the most power and momentum and scale. Jost: All this talk about verified, unverified…. It’s the user who will decide what kind of data point they trust or not. Apparently, they trust the TripAdvisor data point very much even though we, as the industry, say that some of those reviews are unverified. The user, for most of the part, doesn’t care. It’s less about the verified/unverified debate, and it’s more about who drives the booking…. Tnooz: You agree that hotels care more about TripAdvisor than Google these days, when it comes to reviews? Jost: That’s fair, yes. But that will change. My assumption is that Google is going to become a very dominant player that is going to provide a huge amount of leads throughout the funnel, be it directly to brand.com or through the intermediaries. It is going to be a central starting point in the travel journey, more and more. Google is in a great position because it never steals any SEO power from the hotels. The hotel can plug in the review content it has collected via the Stars platform, and that would never count as duplicate content, even though you would find the same review as a Google Review on Google. It’s an advantage because all the other players out there, they need this SEO power. They need the unique content piece. Everyone is competing against each other, and the only one who is really not competing in that game is Google, because they’re the entrance point of search and inspiration. We also don’t compete with anyone because we don’t need to. We are a pure B2B play. We are the Switzerland of review analysis and reputation management. Tnooz: You seem to be saying there’s going to be a tipping point where hotels will realize your TrustScore has a huge impact. Jost: Yes, but more broadly… Despite your questions, I’m not so worried about when we’ll surpass TripAdvisor. Your framing is wrong: It’s not a zero-sum game. For one reason, using our platform to improve your scores on non-TripAdvisor ratings will usually also help your TripAdvisor ones, too. It’s simple logic. If a service improvement helps raise your TrustYou scores, it will logically also help your TripAdvisor rating, too. We’re going to have a huge impact on the TripAdvisor score indirectly because we can still tell you, “Hey, fix your cold coffee problem that you have in your breakfast room because people are complaining about it.” Once you fix it, you are going to see an increase in your scores across the board. One other thing: We do let a hotel analyze the TripAdvisor channel through our analytics. We just don’t take that channel’s reviews into account when we calculate our review summaries. Hotel marketers will recognize us as a force that drives booking on scale. If they don’t recognize us today, they will. If you count all of them together, Kayak, Google, Skyscanner — how many eyeballs do we have on our data? We may have more eyeballs on our data soon than are on TripAdvisor’s. Our winning model is our focus on B2B, on helping the hotel figure out the most effective ways to improve their product. Tnooz: Thanks. Different topic, please. Why acquire Checkmate? Jost: We wanted to be everywhere on the traveler journey when it comes to guest feedback…. Collecting information from the guest via mobile devices as the guest is about to arrive and during their stay was the last piece of the journey we didn’t haven’t well covered. Tnooz: If Checkmate was so great, why did it have to be a distressed asset sale? Meaning, why is this a good acquisition for you? Jost: I can answer generally. Take Expedia. It was an investor in Checkmate, and in Alice, another messaging service. That shows that this segment is still very hot and is at the very beginning. Tnooz: Why will one solution win and another won’t? Jost: It’s going to boil down to execution. How do you build a sales force and execute on marketing effectively. We have at least a good head start in that because we’ve done that sales and marketing work already for other services and we can now plug in this product to all of our customers. We’ve received a lot of positive reaction when we told our customers we’re adding this messaging tech…. You see all these technology stack players. They build a management tool and they want to add a CRM on top and they build some other BI on top and they want to sell this entire technology stack to hotels. We only want to focus on guest feedback….It’s a clearer sales pitch. Tnooz: Isn’t it hard to scale up with independent hotels, with lots of small, one-off deals? Jost: Yes, it’s probably much harder to sell to an independent hotel because the sales cost is higher compared to, “Hey, I just signed Accor,” and 4,000 sales come on board immediately. We don’t have a particularly pure independent sales strategy. We don’t have a particularly pure enterprise sales strategy. We see both as important. With independent hotels, you have to be very effective in your sales approach there, and you have to measure really well how it works. That’s what we’ve been doing. Our team knows today how it works. We know the metrics. We know the funnel. Now we can start to scale that business in the independent hotel sector. Tnooz: How big is your client list? Jost: These numbers everyone is throwing around … Everyone’s saying, “Ah, we’re 50,000 properties. We’re 30,000 properties.” Whatever. I would always say, it depends how you look at it. We are less reliant on a few large chain deals than some competitors. When we say 50,000 hotels worldwide use us for one of our services, we mean we have some of these hotels looking at our data through different portals. We have a lot of hotels looking at our dashboards within a third-party tool or an extranet. For example, we help power the reputation tools on HRS and HolidayCheck. By the end of this year, we have a goal of having specifically 20,000 hotels that feed their own reviews into TrustYou’s guest feedback platform. We will also announce a couple of partnerships with bigger providers that build websites for hotels and that need content to help power brand.com websites or PMS players or CRM players that sit on the guest profile data. We may give them our Stars platform, our feedback platform, for all their hotels for free, so they can start collecting feedback and push it into the guest feedback platform with TrustYou. That’s good for scale. Tnooz: Could you tell us more about TrustYou Stars, your big product push of the year? Jost: Some context, first: We look at all reviews as guest feedback. Whether it is on an OTA or a review site or it is posts and comments on social, it’s guest feedback. We call it surveys when we look at operational procedures of the hotel. But it’s all guest feedback. Why do you want to look at this data feedback in different silos, as some competitor tools do? Why do you want a platform to look at social feedback, but not surveys. Why don’t you want to look at this all together because it’s all together guest feedback? We still let you slice and dice the information to compare and see trends. But we stand out for bringing all the feedback together in the single TrustYou Stars platform. We compete with Medallia, and we’re leaving it behind as the dinosaur in the industry when it comes to guest feedback operations. In 2015, we replaced Medallia for the entire Accor group for all their almost 4,000 hotels. We’ll continue to win big chains because, among other reasons, the TrustYou Stars platform has a sophisticated post-stay survey component. We say, “Hey, if you, at the end of your survey, as a traveler, you get to choose, do you want to push this review or this survey into Google as well and share it with all the other fellow travelers out there? Yes or No?” The traveler has the choice to say, “Yes, I want to share it.” If they say yes, we push it out on Google as a Google Review. This process is unleashing a huge force on behalf of hotels. About half of hotel guest feedback is hidden right now in some guest survey databases not accessible to the web. We say to them, Why don’t you make it public and we take it into account when we calculate your score? Suddenly they can do this, and they make the guest feedback public. It makes for a fuller picture of the stay experience. Now, especially after we fully integrate Checkmate, we’re everywhere guest feedback happens. In the search process, on the intermediary or on the brand.com site, on an app during a stay, and on the post-stay survey or on one of the review channels or be it on their own survey channel or an OTA’s. Our data is responsible for guiding booking decisions. Hotels are noticing.   Previous Article Next Article   About the Writer :: Sean O'Neill Sean O’Neill is Editor-in-Chief of Tnooz.

Photo by Michelle Le. View All Photos (11) / free articles read. Subscribe for unlimited access Read FAQ From Facebook to Google, to work for a tech company in Silicon Valley is to have easy access to a host of dining options that are often exclusive to employees. Mountain View cyber-security company Symantec offers the same amenities as many of its peers, but sets itself apart by making its new eatery, Union 82, open to the public. Quite a few non-employees patronize the cafe, and Becky Laden, a development manager at Symantec, said a tech company opening its own eatery to the public is "not common practice." Local tech giants such as Facebook, Google, LinkedIn and Apple have private cafes and restaurants that are open to employees and their guests, but don't take walk-ins. "Symantec is a collaborative space," said Eric Drake, a district manager. "We want people from other companies to feel comfortable coming into the inner world and experience it. The decision to make (Union 82) open to the public environment is to attract other tech companies and people who have interest in Symantec's product and services they provide and to be able to feel invited into the space." Union 82, named for the company's origins in 1982, has the feel of a modern-day coffee shop, but with more amenities than a typical Starbucks. There are tables for poker, checkers and pool. A giant Scrabble board adorns one of the walls, and on the opposite wall are two large screens that look like mirrors but are actually televisions. The ceiling is full of computer codes, each one translating to either an image or an error (customers who figure out the error win a prize). Upbeat, contemporary music plays in the background. When Symantec Food Service Director Marisha Van Der Linden moved from Connecticut to the Bay Area to open the cafe, she said there were many curveballs -- like the fact that "everyone eats quinoa" in California, she said, and the amount of detail that went into creating the space. Located in the heart of Mountain View's tech hub -- Google is nearby, as well as software companies Veritas, MobileIron and Synopsys -- the 11-month-old Union 82 was created in an effort to help employees temporarily escape from the office. The cafe is just one of the many perks that Symantec, like many other tech companies, offers its employees, from a 12,000-square-foot gym to tennis, basketball and volleyball court. "It's definitely a way to getting employees to come in and hang out," Van Der Linden said. "We actually see people camp out here all day. It's like their own coffee shop." Patrons make good use of the space, which opens for breakfast at 7:30 a.m. and switches to lunch at 11:30 a.m. On a typical morning, some customers drop in briefly to grab a cup of coffee on the way to work, while others hold meetings and discuss business. Symantec executives often bring prospective employees there for interviews; Van Der Linden says it's become "the most interviewed spot on campus." The cafe also offers a weekly happy hour, trivia events and "paint nite," during which patrons can enjoy wine, beer or cocktails while painting. Megan Cleary, who has worked at Symantec for almost a year, stops by Union 82 once a week. She called it "modern" and "hip," and she enjoys the "reasonably priced" smoothies (the "Field of Greens," with bananas, mango, peaches, apples, berries, kale and spinach, is a favorite) and lattes. Union 82's coffee beans, from Verve Coffee Roasters in Santa Cruz, are roasted one week before they arrive. To maximize freshness, they are used within 30 days. The beans are hand-ground for each drink. The menu is modeled after a "gastrolounge," according to Laden, offering pub food but with a healthy twist. Van Der Linden also cites "American tapas" as inspiration for the menu, which features everything from salads and sandwiches to flatbread pizza and ahi tuna tartar. Ingredients are locally sourced, from tomatoes, avocados and olive oil to wines and beers. The "quinoa crunch" salad, a quinoa tabbouleh with seasonal vegetables, avocado, edamame, marinated olives and smoked pepita dressed in a chipotle-orange vinaigrette, and the classic croque monsieur sandwich are among the cafe's most popular offerings. Tributes to Symantec abound: Cocktails are named after Symantec locations or computer terminology, such as the "cleanwipe" -- in the computer world, it's a tool to attack viruses; at Union 82, it's Broker's Gin with cucumber, lime, simple syrup and tonic. And on the menu, "bites" is spelled "bytes." Nestled in between Relish, Symantec's more traditional cafeteria, and an IT support center, Union 82 bills itself as taking a unique spin on company dining that goes beyond just opening its doors to the public. "The style of this place is so warm and welcoming, but at the same time it's innovative and pushing the envelope a little bit, so I think that's important as a crossroads for Symantec," Van Der Linden said.

Brian Stevens, former Red Hat CTO, has reportedly been hired by Google as the vice president of cloud platforms. Stevens’ Twitter and LinkedIn profile list his presumed new title while Google says it doesn’t comment on individual hires. Industry analysts praised Stevens’ work with Red Hat, and see the hire as a smart move by Google. Stevens has been a tireless advocate for OpenStack and drove Red Hat’s involvement with the OpenStack Foundation and its leadership within the community, according to Dave Bartoletti, an analyst with Forrester Research, Inc., based in Cambridge, Mass. “He understands how open source projects need to be supported and nurtured into something the enterprise can actually use,” Bartoletti said. “I expect Google sees in him someone who can help them become a leader in open source and OpenStack, and not just a contributor.” Stevens understands the power of open-source and how to set a vision — two attributes that could help Google as it looks to new leadership to direct its cloud strategy, according to David Linthicum, senior vice president with Cloud Technology Partners, a Boston-based consulting firm. Linthicum singled out Stevens’ role in getting Red Hat to embrace OpenStack and Docker. “Were I in charge of the Google cloud strategy, Brian would be on my list of people to tap, so it’s not that much of a surprise,” Linthicum said. Google is currently spearheading Kubernetes, an open-source container management project with the backing of some of the biggest vendors in the industry, and Google Compute Engine is compatible with a number of open-source tools. But Stevens can help Google craft an OpenStack strategy and lure developers to Google Compute Engine and Google App Engine, the company’s infrastructure- and platform as a service offerings, respectively. “The battle for the developer mindshare in the cloud will be around API support, so I expect him to help build some bridges between Google’s cloud platforms and APIs and the broader OpenStack community,” Bartoletti said. There are huge demands that come with the position of CTO, Linthicum said, and they’re not always related to technology. Google and Red Hat are both great companies to work for, but it may have been time for a change. “I suspect after 12 years of doing that, he may be looking for new challenges,” Linthicum said. “Good for Google, good for Brian, and certainly takes nothing away from Red Hat.” Start the conversation 0 comments Send me notifications when other members comment.

News Stocks Technology Science Health Politics World Videos The Tape Latest Follow WSP Newsletter RSS Facebook Twitter Google+ Search for: HomeNewsWatch Out, Apple (AAPL) and Facebook (FB), There’s a New App in Town Watch Out, Apple (AAPL) and Facebook (FB), There’s a New App in Town A new player will go head to head with Facebook (FB) and Apple (AAPL) on the messenger and video calling front. August 17, 2016 Cristina Lee Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) wants a piece of that (messenger) pie! For years, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) FaceTime and subsequently, Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) messenger have dominated the messenger and video calling front. But now, things are heating up with the entry of Google’s Duo. In a blog post, Google said video calling is the “next best thing to being with someone in person” but using other messengers can be cumbersome because of the complex, interface. The Android OS maker made video calling and insta-messaging a breeze by stripping down Duo’s interface and taking out the complexity out of video calling. Duo is video chat app made simple. The app, which works on both iOS and Android, works with just a single tap. Of course, you’ll have to submit your phone number before activating Duo but set up takes only a few minutes. According to Google’s blog post, Duo is “simple from start to finish,” fast, reliable, and secured. With Duo, you get the most basic video chat app. Its main feature is “Knock Knock,” which allows users to see live video of the caller before answering. Google calls this feature, “more like an invitation rather than an interruption” and “spontaneous and welcoming.” Apart from one-on-one calls and Knock Knock, Duo offers file transfers, text messaging and group calling capabilities. Google struggled to enter the messaging market for years. Apple’s FaceTime remains as one of the most widely used messaging app in the industry while Facebook’s Messenger and SnapChat are steadily growing thanks to the social media element thrown in the mix, attracting younger users in the process. “It’s almost bare-bones, from a feature point of view,” explained Nick Fox, VP of Google’s communications division, who developed the app. “If there’s anything that’s the North Star, it’s really simplicity.” But don’t let Duo’s incredibly simple design fool you, Google has been working hard to attract more users and with that comes four messaging products rolling out soon. As explained by Fox, Google considers its Android text messaging product as a carrier service. Hangout started out as a Facebook messenger competitor but it has slowly progressed into a “productivity and enterprise” service. When asked why Google didn’t merge its Android-based text messaging product with Hangout Fox said, “We thought about that. We thought about that long and hard.  Apps tend to do best when they’re super focused. But it’s harder for an app to do well if it tries to do everything, and does none of those things really well,” he said. “The idea is focus — do one thing very well. How it evolves over time, you know, we’ll see.” Unlike FaceTime, Duo can do video calls on smartphones as well as take calls via wireless connection. Its features are comparable to that of SnapChat without the social media aspect. Although it remains unclear if Apple users would jump ship with Duo’s cross-platform functionality, the new app is likely to win over Android users, which accounts for 80% of the worldwide smartphone market.

The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Google's parent company, Alphabet, is reconsidering plans to dig up streets to lay fiber-optic cable in about a dozen cities after projects in San Jose, California and Portland, Oregon didn't work out. Google announced Chicago as a potential Fiber site in December because of our growing tech scene and big population, inviting city officials to help the company locate possible Google Fiber huts around the area. Now, the Journal says, the project is proving to be too expensive and time-consuming to expand the way in the way it was originally envisioned. Instead, Chicago and several other cities including Los Angeles and Dallas could get the service via wireless technology instead of cables. More than 1,000 cities reportedly applied for the service after Google announced it in 2010 and in the time since, it has only begun service in six metro areas. Google has built a Chicago presence in other ways in recent years, opening its massive local headquarters in the West Loop in December, with both Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Gov. Bruce Rauner making cameos at the office ribbon-cutting ceremony. We'll see if the chumminess continues as the company navigates a new fiber plan.

Russia's Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) has fined Google the equivalent of $6.8 million for violating the country's fair competition laws. The fine comes about one year after the FAS opened its investigation against Google and represents mixed news for the company. One the one hand, the penalty suggests that regulators in the many countries where Google's business practices face scrutiny are moving from merely warning the company to actively taking action against it. At the same time though, the actual amount of the fine itself is so small for a company as wealthy as Google that it is more a symbolic value than anything else. A Google spokesman said the company has received notice of the fine from the FAS and will analyze it before deciding on the next steps. "In the meantime, we continue to talk to all invested parties to help consumers, device manufacturers and developers thrive on Android in Russia." The FAS, which is responsible for enforcing Russia's anti-monopoly laws, opened its case against Google last September at the behest of Russian search engine company Yandex. In a complaint, Yandex claimed that Google's Android bundling policies effectively block third-party application developers from having their products preinstalled on Android handsets. Yandex said that Android handset makers that want to preinstall Google Play on their devices are also mandated, under the bundling requirement, to install other Google apps like Search and Maps. The Russian vendor has claimed the policy prevents others, like itself, from having an opportunity to get valuable real estate on Android handsets. Last October, the FAS ruled that Google had indeed violated Russia's fair competition laws and ordered the company to discard its Android application bundling requirements. It held that Google had abused its market dominance to force handset makers into preinstalling apps on their devices and gave Google one month to implement the change or face stiff fines. Google appealed that decision with the Moscow Arbitration Court. The court earlier this year rejected the appeal. The administrative court agreed with the FAS finding and said that it fully supported the decision requiring Google to discard the Android app bundling requirement. This week's fine is a relatively small one for Google and is unlikely by itself to be much of a deterrent, if that was the FAS' goal. But it highlights the growing impatience with Google's business practices in several countries where rivals have accused the Internet giant of abusing its market dominance. Google faces its biggest legal challenges in Europe, where regulators have opened up three separate investigations against it. Margrethe Vestager, the European Union commissioner for competition, is currently investigating whether Google is abusing its dominance in the search market to play up the company's own comparison shopping sites in favor of rival sites. As in Russia, Vestager's office also is examining whether Google's Android bundling requirements are preventing others from having their software products installed on Android devices. The third investigation, opened in June, involves Adwords, Google's online advertising platform. EU investigators want to know, among other thing, whether Google is preventing companies using Adwords from using similar services being offered by rivals. In addition, authorities in some EU countries are investigating Google for potential underpayment of taxes. France's Ministry of Finance, for instance, is reportedly looking to collect $1.8 billion in back taxes from the company. Google settled a similar dispute in the UK for around $143 million. Google has consistently denied that its business practices violate anti-competition rules, arguing instead that its services have actually helped rivals grow their businesses.           LATEST ENTERPRISE APPS ARTICLES   MapR Launches Analytics Package Backed by Data Scientists Why Microsoft Picked SAP SuccessFactors for Its HCM Needs Microsoft Releases First Office Online Server Update IBM Introduces Industry-Specific-Watson Internet of Things Services Paint 3D Added to Windows 10 Creators Update Build                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

Apparently, the “finishing touches” are being put together before the app hits the App Store. But wait a minute, will the app even be allowed in Apple’s app store? However, Google may be wasting its time because Apple may not accept Google’s Maps app in its app store, seeing as it decided to replace the Google maps app with its own version in its latest software update. Google has been preparing its Maps app for the new operating system since the major PR disaster which befall Apple; when it came to light just how bad their own Maps app is. The app, which is already installed on the iPhone 5, got extremely negative online reviews, with many users pointing out some pretty embarrassing inaccuracies. This led to Tom Cook making a rare public apology, in which it was speculated that it led to the rapid resignation of mobile chief Scott Forstall. What does Google have to say? A Google rep told The WSJ: “We believe Google Maps are the most comprehensive, accurate and easy-to-use maps in the world. Our goal is to make Google Maps available to everyone who wants to use it, regardless of device, browser, or operating system.” As of yet, Apple have declined to comment. Do you think Apple should allow the Google Maps app in its store, or work on improving its own?                               You Might Also Like... 1 Parcel2Go to Invest £300,000 Into Their Customers 21 November 2016 | Editor's Pick, Most Popular, Industry News 2 Parcel2Go Surpass Royal Mail with the UK's Cheapest 2 kg Deliveries 08 November 2016 | Editor's Pick, Most Popular, Industry News 3 What You Need to Know About myHermes Small and Medium 28 October 2016 | Editor's Pick, Most Popular, Parcel Deliveries, Industry News 4 Using eBay Analytics to Make Your Stale Listings Fresh Again 04 August 2016 | eBay, Editor's Pick, Market Place, Tips and Guides 5 Win Big with Our Olympic Competition! 02 August 2016 | Editor's Pick, Most Popular, Competitions Back to Apple Page Back to Google Page Back to Mobile Page Back to News Page Post your comments!

Also read - Independence Day speech: PM Narendra Modi lashes out at Pakistan for glorifying terrorists Doodle courtesy/Google.com Introducing free nation of India to the world on this day, Nehru delivered these famous words, "Long years ago we made a tryst with destiny, and now that time comes when we shall redeem our pledge, not wholly or in full measure, but very substantially. At the stroke of today's midnight hour, when the world sleeps, India will awake to life and freedom." According to Google, his speech marked the culmination of the Indian independence movement, which was in motion for nearly a century. “Tryst with Destiny” was the climax; the power of nonviolence had, in the end, freed India. The Indian independence Movement spanned a total of 190 years (1757-1947). India became a sovereign and democratic nation on 12:02 am, 15th August, 1947, which has been observed as Independence Day since then owing to the end of the British regime over the country. On that 15 August, both Pakistan (whose partition from India was announced by Viscount Louis Mountbatten, on 3rd June 1947) and India had the right to remain in or remove themselves from the British Commonwealth, but the latter decided to remain the commonwealth in 1949.

Follow TechnoBuffalo It looks like Google is planning to launch the final version of Android 7.0 Nougat on August 22. At least, that’s according to Canadian operator Telus, which lists the date as a “target launch” for Android N; the devices compatible with Telus’ network expected to get Android Nougat include the Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X. For what it’s worth, Telus was accurate with its launch date for Android 6.0 Marshmallow, according to Android Central. Really, the software’s early arrival shouldn’t come as a surprise, as Google released the first developer preview all the way back in March. Since then, the software has only gotten better, with July’s Developer Preview 5 being the most stable release yet. Earlier this week, LG announced it will offer a limited preview of Android Nougat to G5 owners in Korea, which just so happens to begin on Aug. 22. Are you starting to see a pattern? If indeed Android Nougat lands on Monday, we should expect an announcement early in the morning followed by system images and an OTA update for Nexus owners. Plenty of evidence suggests Google will also unveil two new Nexus devices soon, though it’s unclear if they’ll coincide with next week’s possible Android 7.0 release. Apparently, the LG V20 will be the first device to ship with Nougat, which means we can probably expect Marlin and Sailfish, the codenames for these Nexus phones, to come out shortly after. Mark your calendars because it’s sounding like Monday, Aug. 22 is going to be a good day to be a Nexus owner.

Uber will launch a fleet of human-supervised self-driving Volvo SUVs in Pittsburgh later this month, and Ford plans to have autonomous cars ready for hailing by 2021. But Uber, who has raced to be first to market, isn’t just seizing opportunity for self-driving passenger vehicles. Today, the company announced that it has acquired Otto, a self-driving big-rig truck company. Otto creates kits that can be installed in freight vehicles to make them drive autonomously, with minimal human intervention. Ex-Googlers Anthony Levandowski and Lior Ron founded Otto in January of this year. Ron was previously product head for Google Maps as well as Motorola. Levandowski led the development of Google’s first self-driving car and has pioneered self-driving technology throughout his career. Related: Entrepreneurs Are Working to Uber-fy the Trucking Industry Last month, Entrepreneur sat down with Ron to learn about how his background led him to found Otto and get a glimpse of what an autonomous trucking future might look like. Why did you decide to found Otto and focus on self-driving trucks? Anthony and me have known each other for the past almost decade. We came together and realized, there’s no other technology that excites us more and has more promise to impact society and benefit society in the next couple of years. It really has the potential to reshape how cities are built, reshape how transportation is made, to reshape many of the issues that we have in society today, from safety to environment to productivity. We started talking about the future of self-driving and what can we do to accelerate the future and reap some of those societal benefits sooner than later. And we realized that while there was so much activity going on on the passenger side and all of those great minds and projects, including Google, there wasn’t a lot of attention being given to something as important as that, which is commercial transportation, and how we move goods, not just people. And if you think about that, really, moving goods is the backbone of economy. Everything around us, except us, was on a truck at some point, at some time. A truck touched it. Seventy percent of all of the cargo in the U.S. is being moved by trucks. We all live in an on-demand era, and there are more and more demands on the shipping and logistical network of the U.S., but just not enough supply of truck drivers, of capacity, in freight. By showing we can deploy autonomy and technology in this market, we hope that will unlock a lot of the societal challenges and opportunities, the regulations, public adoption and comfort with the technology. The challenge of bringing the technology to market is not just a technological challenge. It’s also a business, product challenge, of how can we constrain the problem for something that can be solved in the foreseeable future. The nice thing about the logistics and commercial transportation market is, if we can constrain the market to really be around highways, and on highways exit to exit, that’s 95 percent of the commercial transportation in the U.S. How did your background lead you to Google and, ultimately, Otto? I came to Google after business school at Stanford. And before that, I had the pleasure of serving seven years in the Israeli military. As part of that, at a very young age, I was given a lot of responsibilities and a lot of opportunities around building an applied technology to solve intelligence problems. It had to do with knowledge, and machine learning and GIS systems. So that’s where I got my love for geography and geo-information systems and applying data at scale to solve a problem. Google Maps was a natural transition for me to really take all of that understanding of how those technologies happen in a more closed setting in the military and apply them in a much wider scale with consumers. I joined Google Maps in 2007, the very early days. It was really a very special time, because it was a small team, and we had basically an unlimited opportunity in front of us to really map the world and build the most precise, most advanced, most comprehensive map of the universe. Anthony joined Google after his startup was acquired. He helped kickstart and accelerate the Streetview development in technology. We did a lot of work on how to entice users to contribute and enhance the map. That was all Map 1.0, I would call it. We built Google Maps, we scaled it from a couple of million users to over a billion users in the course of those five years. Then Map 2.0 is really taking that to the next level and really moves to a more real-time nature of the map. As you move to real-time, you really have to have more of a user contribution, because things are dynamic. I would call Waze, which I was helpful in integrating to Google, probably the best example of that Map 2.0 wave. And really, self-driving vehicles are Map 3.0, which is a highly accurate, super dynamic, real-time, super high-detailed representation of the world around us, which requires new sensors and new way of thinking about how to build the map. Anthony was always more on sort of the robotic, self-driving side. He also, essentially, was involved in starting the self-driving car project at Google and one of the founding team members. We just had a great partnership along the years. And it’s time to take that vision of deploying autonomy to society in other spaces and start doing that. Otto co-founders Lior Ron and Anthony Levandowski. Image credit: Otto We both left Google in January to start Otto. We started with two of us in a house in Palo Alto with a truck, and fast forward five or six months after, we have over 70 people in a nice, big warehouse in San Francisco. We have four trucks driving 24/7 on the highways. They’re mostly driving in California, but in other states, such as Nevada, the ability to test completely driverless with complete autonomy is a bit easier. We’re in the process of starting to test and drive in more states. And you two self-funded Otto from the start. There’s a lot of advice on how to bootstrap businesses. We are just fortunate to be successful in our careers so we can afford to bootstrap, but bootstrapping gives you wings, and gives you freedom and gives you flexibility of how you want to build the business, and how fast you want to move and what culture you want to build early on. We were able and fortunate to use that self-funding to move very fast and hire a team very fast without stopping to raise outside capital. We were able to grow the team from two of us in a small garage in Palo Alto to over 70 people in San Francisco. A big group followed us from Google. A group of Apple engineers that were excited and left Apple to join us. A couple of key engineers from Tesla. The flexibility allowed us to be faster and move faster and create a lot of options for us of how we wanted to carry the business forward, talk with partners and build the company. I highly recommend it if you can afford it and you have the confidence in the business to build. Right now you’re really focused on highway trucks, but do you foresee applying your self-driving kits to other types of vehicles involved in the shipping and distribution industry? The kit choice is part of that accelerating the future, and how can we bring the technology to market as fast as possible. The way to do that is by taking existing trucks and not waiting for a very long cycle of replacing the entire fleet. Of the 2 million long-haul trucks in the U.S. today, it takes almost five years for a big fleet to replace the trucks, and then the truck stays on the road for another five, six years with smaller fleets. Those engines can run a million miles, which means 10, 11 years of livelihood on the roads. So, we really wanted to bring that change as soon as we can. And to do that, the best way is to build an aftermarket kit. So that’s what we’re focused on. The other benefit of the kit is, in terms of time, in terms of cost, you don’t have to buy a completely new vehicle. You can just take your existing investment and convert it into a much more productive, much safer truck by deploying the kit. And it allows us to test and deploy much faster. The same approach could be applied to other types of vehicles as well, whether it’s cars, or agriculture, like tractors, or a host of other vehicles. We’re just very focused on commercial transportation and trucking. It’s a big enough problem and space for us to try and change and solve. In the passenger market, it’s really about minimizing the cost and trying to do a lot of things that would fit our appetite as consumers and our willingness to spend on that new technology. There are a lot of commonalities, but there are also many differences between those markets. How much do the kits cost? We don’t have a specific price point in mind. It’s too early. We’ve mentioned, I think, in passing, some example number, but really, at scale, that technology shouldn’t cost anything close to the cost of the truck. So a truck would cost today, a new Volvo truck, off the lot, with all of the amenities and latest-and-greatest, like, $160,000. We really aim for the price point to be affordable because we want to drive that future and see those societal benefits unlocked as soon as possible. We’re starting with an aftermarket kit, but there’s no reason not to integrate that into vehicles leaving the production line, so new trucks come equipped with the technology from day one. Have you thought about a separate lane, or other kinds of infrastructural changes -- or limitations on this -- if it really proliferates? Would this technology enable more trucks to be on the road? The future is exciting! I don’t have a crystal ball on the future, but I know it’s going to be different. The drivers are going be in the cabin for the foreseeable future. We’re not trying to replace them. They’re basically getting a co-pilot, and they’re elevated from having to be in the loop 24/7 to really just be like a pilot, where 99 percent of the "flight" is being done by the computer, and the driver, or the "pilot" is there to just lift off and land. The driver is still there, but he can sleep a little bit while the computer is basically driving on the vast, thousands of miles of empty highway. Image credit: Otto So that’s really what we’re aiming for, and when we get to that, then a lot of new opportunities arise. You can route those trucks very efficiently. You can be thoughtful about combining loads more effectively to get the number of trucks smaller, not bigger, because there’s more predictability of where those trucks are. You can start driving at night and use the nighttime, which is mostly empty now, because truck drivers try to maintain sleeping patterns, and they prefer to drive during the day. And potentially, rather than those folks having to be away from home 300 days a year, they can really see their family much more because they can complete the same route more than double as fast because the robot is doing more of the driving for them, which means they can get to the destination and back much faster and actually have the ability to build a local family. You can think about different ways to deploy distribution centers. Right now, distribution centers are being built very close to the destination. But you can think about building bigger distribution centers in farther away places, because you can get to places faster. Stepping back, innovations in transportation have always been, for me, about finding time and space. It’s like a Star Trek-like warp-hole "engage" button. Because every time you redefine basic transportation, you redefine space and time. When the car was invented, it was really the predicament to start expanding cities. When there became common households, that was really the start of suburban communities. When flights and the plane were invented, it redefined geography. Same here, applied to commercial transportation. Once that network is in place, our whole definition of what it means to ship goods, how to do that is going to be completely transformed. What types of partnerships are in store? Shippers are interested in shipping more goods on the road and making their fleets safer and more sustainable. We can drive trucks in a much more thoughtful way. We don’t have to constantly accelerate or decelerate. We can move in the same route at the same constant speed, controlled by the computer, which means less pollution and a much more sustainable footprint. Trucking companies are excited for the same reason, OEMs [original equipment manufactures] are excited about the potential to embed the technology into the vehicles. Related: Never Fear, Uber Is Here! Crime and Fatal Accident Rates Fall Since Company Launch. There have been a lot of discussions of how to apply the technology in the real world, that’s what I’m psyched about as a business and product leader, is how can we take technology and really use it to transform society. We see that transformation happening now by talking with shippers on how to integrate that into the logistical network, by talking with couriers about how this will impact and change their business, so that has been very refreshing. What do you have to do to convince truck operators to adopt this technology? In theory, it may sound like a great idea, but what are some of the concerns that they have? I would say, at large, everyone in the industry that we spoke with is very excited by the promise. They see, day in and day out, the issues and challenges that we’re trying to solve. Everything from safety on the roads, which manifests for them in costs. There are thousands of unnecessary fatalities. Maybe 1 percent of the vehicles in the U.S. are trucks, and they’re driving 5 percent of the miles and they’re responsible for 10 percent of the fatalities. So they experience more and more and more demand, which, in turn, translates to more and more and more pressure on those truck drivers to drive longer and longer and longer. And they’re craving for a safer solution that will allow them to fulfill that demand while still being safe. They see the productivity issues of basically having a fleet of trucks laying around only driving nine, 10 hours a day, because that’s the limit of the truck driver. Because after that, every additional 30 minutes doubles the chance of accident. That’s just our ability to stay attentive as humans. So they see the potential to utilize their assets, their trucks, much better. We got super positive response from everyone, from the big shippers, to the big trucking fleets, to the medium ones and even the small, what’s called owner-operator, which is basically a mom-and-pop shop, owning like one, two, five trucks. They’re excited to equip their trucks with the self-driving kits so they can, again, be more productive and drive almost more than double what they’re driving today, and be twice as productive and have twice as much revenue per truck. So we’ve gotten hundreds of emails and letters and support from, even just single truck drivers, eager to get the safety technology on their trucks. That being said, the challenge is, first and foremost, seeing is believing. I think we as people, many times, are fearful of the unknown, and it sounds great, as you said, in theory, but in practice, people really want to touch it, sense it, feel it, understand what it is. And I think the more we can collaborate with partners and test in more and more states, and really have as many people understand the technology, experience it, see one of our self-driving trucks on the highway, slowly but surely, people will start feeling more and more comfortable with the technology. In your video, the truck has the Otto logo on it and imagery. Is that something that you foresee, it being a brand and the trucks being branded? We are very thoughtful about the brand. We wanted the brand to stand for technology, for innovation, for the brave new world for automobiles -- "auto, Otto." We see that as an integral part of the story, not just, "Here’s the technology, good luck." It’s, "Here is a new way to think about commercial transportation." So the brand is front and center. Image credit: Otto There are many ways to then define and express in the market. Could be Otto trucks, could be partner trucks powered by Otto. The brand is gonna be there, we’re excited about the name, we’re excited about the meaning, we’re excited about the reception and the visibility. We want the other inhabitants of the highway to know there’s an automated truck driving. We want them to understand what it means, so part of the name and brand is also important just for the product on its own, to communicate what it stands for and how it’s gonna behave. Anything else you’d like to add? From an entrepreneur perspective, I would say two things: I was just fortunate to get my basic education in how to use technology to disrupt problems in the military, then be able to apply that at scale on Google Maps and really think about how to get technology into the world as sort of a network problem: Maps, self-driving. At Motorola, I learned the joys and wonders of building physical objects and how can that transform our world and lives, and to not be afraid of constraining myself to just software, but also having the appetite to build physical stuff. All of those paths led me to take on this challenge, and that has been a joy. I encourage entrepreneurs to really aim for the moon. The amount of effort you put into going and doing something very ambitious, vs. opening a grocery shop is the same. You have to be a laser-focused on the problem you’re solving, you have to build your customer base, you have to develop your differentiator, you have to raise capital. It still applies. So I encourage people that they might as well try and solve some of the societal problems that we face. Related: VCs Share 3 Secrets for Mastering Any Niche The Valley and technology has its ways. Lots of entrepreneurs tend to do stuff that they know, which them leads them to choose the 100th company to do the same thing in a slightly different flavor, a slightly different take. I encourage people to go out of their comfort zone, and really to step back and think, from a societal perspective, "How can I lend my skills against a problem that really needs to be solved and will have a major impact?" vs. "How can I lend my skills to something that I might be slightly more familiar with but doesn’t really move the needle in the grand scheme of things?” Learn a new domain. Whether it’s maps or mobile handsets and the mobile industry or the truck industry, disruption always happens from the outside. You don’t have to have 20 years of trucking experience to be able to help and provide value in the trucking industry. Go out of your comfort zone and seek opportunities to really bring innovation to new things. This interview has been edited. Lydia Belanger Lydia Belanger is an associate editor at Entrepreneur.com.

All rights reserved Terms of use Privacy Sitemap The Intercept_ Unofficial _Sources f t ✉ ⎕ 47 Photo: Win McNamee/Getty Images White House Official Cozied Up to Google Before Antitrust Lawsuit Was Shelved David Dayen David Dayen 2016-08-18T16:21:32+00:00 Photo: Win McNamee/Getty Images When the Federal Trade Commission neared a momentous decision on whether to charge Google with violating antitrust laws in January 2013, the White House was watching closely. New emails uncovered by the Campaign for Accountability, a public interest watchdog organization, show that a White House advisor met with top Google lobbyist Johanna Shelton and top Google antitrust counsel Matthew Bye twice in the weeks before the FTC announcement. And minutes prior to the final decision – in which FTC commissioners took the unusual step of overriding their staff’s recommendation to sue, and voted to settle the case instead – the White House official even sought Google’s talking points in the matter. The FTC is an independent agency within the executive branch. As with the Justice Department, the White House political staff is prohibited from contacting federal regulators who might bring a formal case on behalf of the government. And ever since Richard Nixon stifled the antitrust investigation into ITT, a major donor, White House interference in antitrust cases has been particularly forbidden. When Donald Trump threatened to bring up Amazon on antitrust charges because he was getting bad press from the Washington Post, owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, it was correctly seen as chilling. The revelation about the White House’s contacts with Google prior to the FTC decision is another example of the extraordinarily close relationship between Google and the Obama White House. In April, the Campaign for Accountability found — and The Intercept published — evidence from the White House’s own records of frequent meetings between Google staff and Obama administration personnel – over one a week since the beginning of his presidency – and spins through the revolving door between Google and the U.S. government. Nearly 250 people have shuttled from government service to Google employment or vice versa over the course of Obama’s tenure. This close contact, as well as Google’s partnership with the executive branch on a host of projects, almost inevitably breeds a camaraderie that is at odds with the ability of the government to actually regulate a private company. The West Wing’s coziness with Google officials prior to the antitrust decision speaks to that. At the time, the FTC was looking into allegations that Google harmed Internet customers and its rivals by prioritizing its own companies and affiliates in search engine results and its placement of online advertising on its search sites. The staff of the Bureau of Competition at the FTC recommended suing after concluding that Google engaged in anticompetitive conduct that “has resulted – and will result – in real harm to consumers and to innovation.” But in the end, the FTC reached a settlement that forced Google into voluntary changes to its business. “Johanna, I hear big news coming out momentarily,” wrote White House internet advisor R. David Edelman to Shelton on January 3, 2013, referring to the FTC’s imminent decision. “Do you have the release and any accompanying materials from Google’s side? Obviously, lots of interest here at the WH.” TK   The FTC announced its decision that day. Within 20 minutes, Shelton responded to Edelman with links to Google’s statement on the closing of the antitrust case, and its “commitment letter” to voluntary changes, as per the FTC’s order. “Please let me know if you have any questions,” Shelton said. A minute later, Edelman replied. “I’m watching the webcast now,” he wrote, presumably referring to the FTC’s announcement of closing the case. “Thanks for the links!” TK   The newly released emails reveal that the White House was interested in and actively discussing the case before the FTC made their decision, and let the target of the investigation know that. Based on previous open records requests, we also know that meetings between Google executives and White House personnel spiked in the months leading up to the FTC decision. Edelman met personally with Shelton and Bye twice in the final weeks of the investigation. Between 2012 and 2015, Edelman held at least 18 meetings with Google officials in the White House, per previously released records. That does not include informal meetings outside the White House at D.C. coffee shops, a technique the White House has been accused of using to get around public records. Edelman’s emails include references to these meetings. Obama Administration officials have maintained that they did not pressure the FTC in any way to close the investigation into Google. “Our staff is cognizant that it is inappropriate to discuss issues relating to regulatory enforcement,” said spokeswoman Jennifer Friedman in 2015, adding that the FTC “is an independent agency and we respect their independent decision-making.” Many tech industry rivals claim that Google still biases its search engine results and advertising. The European Union, operating with the same evidence, has filed three antitrust charges against Google over this behavior, the most recent in July.

Black and white wallpapers for macOS and iOS   skip to main content skip to main menu     With few weeks until iOS 10’s fall release, iOS 9 adoption hits 87 percent of devices By Christian Zibreg, Aug 18, 2016 Tweet 11 Comments Various editions of iOS 9 are currently installed on 87 percent of iPhone, iPad and iPod touch devices, a one-point gain versus a month ago. During the same period, iOS 8 has dropped from eleven to ten percent of devices, suggesting much of iOS 9’s growth could be owed to upgrades. Earlier editions of iOS continue to comprise about three percent of devices. The stats were derived from Apple’s logs capturing devices that accessed the App Store on August 15, 2016, and are publicized on the App Store dashboard. By comparison, Google’s official stats have Android 6.0 Marshmallow powering 15.2 percent of smartphones and tablets, with the two-year-old Lollipop (5.0-5.1) OS found on more than one-third of Android hardware (35.3 percent). Google’s numbers don’t take into account the following: Devices without Google Play services, like those sold in China Forked Android builds, like Amazon Fire OS Devices running Android versions older than 2.2 Any other devices that did not visit the Play Store during a seven-day period ending on August 1, 2016 Google’s fragmentation problem and slow rollouts of software upgrades by carriers and device vendors should be blamed for the fact that a vast majority of Android device owners run software more than two years old. Of course, Android continues to dominate in terms of worldwide market share. As per Gartner, Android smartphones accounted for 86.2 percent of worldwide sales in the June quarter. During the same period, iOS lost two percentage points, falling from 14.6 percent worldwide in the second quarter of 2015 to 12.9 percent. “In the second quarter of 2016, Samsung had nearly 10 percent more market share than Apple,” said Gartner. “Samsung saw sales of its Galaxy A and Galaxy J series smartphones compete strongly with Chinese manufacturers. Its new smartphone portfolio also helped Samsung win back share it recently lost in emerging markets.” iPhone sales dipped sharply in Greater China and Asia/Pacific and slightly in Apple’s two strongest markets: U.S. and Western Europe. On a more positive note, its sales in Eastern Europe, Eurasia and Sub-Saharan Africa grew 95 percent year over year. All told, the Cupertino firm has had three consecutive quarters of slowing demand as sales declined 7.7 percent. In Apple’s defense, market share doesn’t tell the whole story. For starters, the company does not compete in the mid and low-end of the global smartphone market at all—its most affordable iPhone is the $399 iPhone SE. With strong global sales of sub-$400 devices (most of the handsets sold in India are sub-$100 phones, for example), of course market share numbers are going to be skewed significantly in Android’s favor. Bottom line: Android is the world’s most-used mobile OS, but iOS remains the king of the hill when it comes to device and app profitability and third-party software support.

I wonder if the late rise has anything to do with a recent jailbreak release… Dany Quirion 99% of ios users dont give a crap about jailbreak Scott Curry Nice made up statistic you have there… John Smith It’s not made up. 1 billion iOS devices, probably saying 100 million jailbreak is a huge exaggeration. 99.99% would be more accurate. Scott Curry Not made up? Cool. Show me where you got your information from. Links andor citations? John Smith I know I’m wasting my time because you’re going to continue being a childish prick, but for others who actually will do their research this is what I have. When Apple reached the 500 million mark for iOS devices, roughly 23 million were reported to be jailbroken and active. This was at the time iOS 6 was released I believe, so jailbreaking really was in high demand, as on top of tweaks, full fledged themes could have been made, which since iOS 7 have been limited to simply changing icons. As the theme customization went down, and iOS went more colorful and feature-rich, less and less people felt the need to jailbreak their devices apart from the dedicated fanbase, and piraters (which you probably are as well). And as quality tweaks disappeared, less and less people have been inclined to rejailbreak because their tweak purchases would go to waste an update or two later. By iOS 9, only about 7 million people jailbroke their iOS devices, which really is saying something about the jailbreak scene. Even when you take outdated devices that can no longer be hacked, over half a million devices still support the latest iOS version. By adding numbers, it is still less than 1%. If you’re seriously going to continue saying “where’s your proof”, you can go do the research yourself under “percentage of people jailbreaking iphones”. Tommy correct, shut up the child 😀 Scott Curry I did 🙂 Scott Curry It’s not on me to do any research as I’m not providing any statistics. I didn’t know asking for validation of stats was childish. I thought it’s childish to spout stats with nothing to back it up. Dig on this: 83.6% of reported statistics are made up on the spot. 😉 John Smith You do realize if I post a link Disqus will “queue” my comment to be approved by iDB right? Sometimes it takes them a few days to approve it. Stop dragging this further than it needs to go and look it up. Or continue being obnoxious, whichever seems easier for you. I got Stranger Things to catch up to. Scott Curry I stated a possible correlation, nothing more. You want to try to be a ‘childish prick’ and throw out justification of stats just trying to continue an argument that you didn’t even start in the first place. No one was even talking to you until you felt the need to step in with your anonymous login. So…John Smith (lol)….go watch your Netflix and just chillllllllllll. I’m done with you.

Google Now Cards to Be Brought to Chrome New Tabs on Android The new feature will be visible in Chrome for Android Aug 18, 2016 15:51 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Google frequently makes changes to its Google Now application in Android, as it tries to offer users information at their fingertips. Now, Android Police reports that the Mountain View-based giant intends to bring Google Now cards to Chrome's New Tab on Android. Google is making changes to its Chrome browser on Android smartphones as the company plans to bring Google Now cards to New Tabs in Android. The change has appeared first in Chrome Dev, and users need to toggle a flag in order to see it. Android Police reports that the new feature is live for everyone and that it works in Chrome Beta, but it's not live yet. In addition, it might need to be activated on some devices while it may come as default in others. The new section displays recent bookmarks and suggested news stories. The flag that needs to be activated is called “Show content snippets on the New Tab page.” The section has a few alternate modes, including some that show content based on the most visited websites or using non-personalized data. The cards can be accessed in Chrome Beta, but they won't display bookmarks, and the source of the links seems to be unclear. The new feature should eventually roll out to the stable Chrome application, but it's difficult to say when that will actually happen. Google is also testing a new Dashboard tab in Google Now, one that would collect data from across various Google services and provide it into one tab.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (3 Images) #Google#Google Now#Chrome app#Android#Google services reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Google Now cards to arrive to Chrome app on Android (3 Images) 01 02 03 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google Tests New Dashboard Tab in Google Now Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides Get Updates on Android and iOS Home Button in Nougat 7.0 Shown in Animation, Could Be Tied to Google Assistant Google's New Nexus Launcher May Arrive on Sailfish and Marlin Nexus Phones iPhone 8 to Feature Traditional Wireless Charging like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Lenovo Builds a New Microsoft Surface Clone and It Looks Fabulous Anonymous Hackers Want McAfee to Be Trump’s Security Adviser, Call for March Hackers Could Infect Headphones to Spy on You The LG V20 Has Been Successfully Rooted Galaxy S6 and S7 Owners Complain About Samsung’s Stock Email App Facebook Is Testing a New Snapchat-like Camera Feature Google Adds Stranger Things Stickers to Allo, New Themes to Arrive Soon 3 photos    Google Now cards to arrive to Chrome app New Android APKs VivaVideo APK: Updated November 23rd, 14:19 GMT PowerDirector APK: Updated November 23rd, 14:08 GMT WeVideo APK: Updated November 23rd, 14:04 GMT Amazon Rapids APK: Updated November 23rd, 14:02 GMT ActionDirector APK: Updated November 23rd, 13:58 GMT DataEye APK: Updated November 23rd, 13:46 GMT JOOX APK: Updated November 23rd, 13:46 GMT Reader comments Don't Install Note 7 ROMs on Previous Models, Samsung Could Limit Battery Charge more on: Galaxy Note 7 i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

The desktop Outlook email program would no longer be available. The reception was not warm. "A lot of people really hated the front end to Google. They found it to be restrictive, difficult to find the mail, difficult to search mail," said AbiDaoud, who joined the Toronto-based mining company as CIO in 2010. "There were a lot of different ways of doing things that people just didn't like." It didn't stop there. "Can't we bring Outlook back?" became a common refrain. After two years, AbiDaoud gave in. Those who wanted Outlook could have it back. But there was a catch: They'd no longer be able to use tools built into Apps for Work that let them collaborate in real time on documents or chat face-to-face on video. Joe AbiDaoud "When we opened it back up to the 1,300 users, probably a dozen or so installed it," AbiDaoud said. What has become manifest amid cutthroat competition between the two major figures in the cloud email market -- Microsoft, with Office 365, the cloud version of its standard software suite, and Google, with its own business package, Apps for Work -- is a cultural divide between organizations that want the comfort and assurance of a pillar of technological convention and ones that are willing to -- or over time, can -- adopt new ways of working, whether emailing clients, typing documents or scheduling workdays. Apps for Work vs. Office 365: Battle royale Companies are increasingly looking to outsource their email and other productivity software like calendaring and word processing. They're enticed by lower costs, better disaster recovery and scalability offered by vendors, but the market is still nascent. A 2016 study by market research outfit Gartner shows 13% of publicly traded companies are using cloud offerings from either Microsoft or Google. Office 365 claims nearly 9% of the email market; Apps for Work grabs just under 5%. The remaining 87% has email in-house, in data centers or private clouds, or use hosted email services. The two vendors' software packages have the same basic lineup: web-based email, word processing, calendar, messaging, spreadsheets and slideshow generator. Google Apps is popular among startups and small businesses for its straightforward licensing, easy administration and lower cost, said Gartner analyst Guy Creese, while big companies tend to go with Office 365. Among public companies using cloud email, 11% are on Office 365 versus just 2% on Apps for Work, according to Gartner. The market is also seeing an industry divide, with segments such as advertising, technology, entertainment and media companies favoring Apps for Work, while organizations in regulated industries such as banking, energy and pharmaceuticals often go with Office 365. But sorting out market share is not always clear-cut, especially with regard to enterprise cloud offerings, Creese said. Guy Creese Four years ago, when Hudbay was evaluating cloud email packages, the company was expanding beyond North America into South America. It wanted "a consistent user experience across all our operations no matter what country they happened to be in," AbiDaoud said. Google's Apps for Work was the clear choice for cloud email at the time. Office 365 was a fledgling business suite, with limited features and a small user base. Microsoft's success in the market now is a result of a concerted effort by Microsoft to improve its offering, Creese said, and of the popularity of cloud computing itself. "It's more really along the lines of Microsoft finally having a credible product -- because certainly in the early years of Google Apps for Work, it didn't," Creese said. "It's not so much as [Microsoft] taking share away from Google; it's more that more people are moving toward the cloud, and Microsoft is taking a good chunk of those people." In with the old Once Office 365 worked, its uptake was not surprising. Many workers have strong attachments to Office software -- to Outlook email, to Excel spreadsheets, to PowerPoint slide presentations, Creese said. That's especially true for certain portions of the workplace population, like lawyers, who write contracts using Microsoft Word, send to outside counsel and get the documents back with the red marks and deletions all recorded using the Track Changes feature. Big corporations that make the move to cloud just don't want the disruption that Google's software alternatives to Office -- Google Docs for Word, Google Sheets for Excel -- could bring. "For them, [running] Office 365 is less jarring from an administrative point of view than moving to something completely new like Google Apps," Creese said. Jonathan Reichental, CIO at the Palo Alto, Calif., city government, empathizes. Before going live with Office 365 in May, he compared the suite, feature for feature, with Apps for Work. Jonathan Reichental "People with the city were very familiar with Microsoft products, having used them for the better part of the last 20 to 30 years," Reichental said. "So the change management and change costs -- the city did not have the appetite for that. They didn't want to have to relearn apps." Apps for Work vs. Office 365: Practical applications Meanwhile, Google has nearly a 50% share of companies with revenue under $50 million, according to Gartner. Startups in particular are drawn to Apps for Work's low cost -- starting at $5 for each user a month -- for desktop and mobile use. (Microsoft's comparable plan is $8.25.) They also like the built-in collaboration capabilities, Creese said, including sharing and editing documents in real time, no matter where they happen to be working.   Some companies even use Google's word processing program, Google Docs, to record meeting minutes, eliminating the need for transcription services. They also use Google's real-time capabilities and its video and messaging platform, Hangouts, to plan budgets, an exercise typically involving an Excel spreadsheet passed among department heads over email that all has to be aggregated, taking a month or six weeks. Not so, on Google Sheets, Creese said. "Instead of someone [saying] 'Well, I think this should go up 10%.' Somebody else objects and says, 'No, it should only go up 5,'" Creese said. In Apps for Work's version of the spreadsheet program, "You can discuss right there and decide, 'OK, we're going to make it 7.' And it's done." At Hudbay, AbiDaoud said employees use Google Hangouts everywhere to share documents and work together -- some from their desktops, others from mobile devices in boardroom meetings. Another benefit for Hudbay is Google Apps' instant language translator -- a huge help for a company with operations in South America. "You're actually typing a document, a Google Doc, and it could be a 10-, 15-page document. You can literally say, 'Translate this document,' and Google will translate the entire document for you into a different copy," AbiDaoud said. The translations aren't always grammatically on point, so AbiDaoud sends them to native speakers for a read. "It's a lot easier to proofread a document than to translate a document."

Very useful. Add My Comment Cancel   [-] SoniaC - 24 Aug 2016 7:38 PM I'm constantly surprising people who have moved to Google Apps when we start discussing what it does and how they use it. Real time co-authoring? Office 365 can do that, and with Skype IM integration. Sharing outside the organisation without the recipient needed a login? Office 365 can do that too. The Microsoft solution has come a long way and those features that most people think are a Google only thing are now the tip of the iceberg of what Office 365 can do. The next challenge is taking the platform to the next level by focusing on what you should do with it to release immediate value to your business, instead of getting overwhelmed with what you could do with it.

Its founding members worked at Google, said one of them, CTO Mike Knapp. "When we left, Google Apps was the only option we really seriously considered," Knapp wrote and shared, appropriately, in a Google Doc. "We really haven't looked back. We love how simple it is to configure and onboard new employees." The company has approximately 200 employees spread across the United States, Australia and China, and they're constantly online at the same time, editing documents in Google Docs, the Sheets spreadsheet program and Google's slideshow generator, Google Slides. (The other half is on the shoe production line or work in the company's six store locations.) Google's work applications are more than Shoes of Prey's collaboration platform; the productivity suite also serves as its IT department. Mike Knapp "As the de facto head of IT, I also very much appreciate not having to worry about scaling an IT infrastructure or maintaining a help desk," Knapp said, adding that Google's list of frequently asked questions on Apps for Work helps him in most situations. "I also don't have to wear a pager and fix servers in the middle of the night." Familiarity breeds content Google Apps is widely used in higher education, partly because college students "grew up with Google Apps," said Gartner analyst Guy Creese, citing the example of Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. Guy Creese Several years ago, Northwestern was running its webmail on Microsoft Exchange Server. The school told him students hated it and demanded Google Apps. "So to a certain extent, this [was] a political decision -- 'Let's keep the students from rioting. Let's just give them what they want.'" At some colleges and universities, Creese said, it's common to find faculty and staff using Microsoft Office for their work applications -- whether Office is powered by physical servers or in the cloud -- and students on Google Apps. Denison University, a small liberal arts school in Granville, Ohio, brought on Google Apps for Education -- a free, higher-education version -- five years ago for standard email, collaboration and sharing capabilities. Office 365 was implemented in June 2015, but the school doesn't force any of its 2,250 students or 700-plus faculty and staff members to use one set of tools or another, said CIO Dena Speranza. In fact, there's a lot of mixing and matching of work applications. Dena Speranza "Where I see 365 being preferred [is] in our business office, where they're very heavy Excel users. That's their primary tool that they use for a lot of work," Speranza said. Students and professors use Google's file sync-and-share system Google Drive to hand over papers and grades, she said. "We've got the best of both worlds. They're able to do what they need to do with either tool." There's not an app for that Using Google Apps for Work -- alongside another productivity suite or not -- could have downsides, Creese said. Take the Google+ social media application. While it works fine, it's not covered under Google's corporate service-level agreement. So if there's a problem, calling Google for support isn't an option, Creese said. "You're looking at the user forum just like 10 million consumers are." Another issue is compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). To comply, Google will sign a business associate agreement, which binds the company to the privacy standards laid out in HIPAA. But -- and this is a big but -- the customer now can't use certain pieces of the software suite, Creese said. "So part of what Google says is, 'Oh, if you really want to be HIPAA-compliant, that means you won't be using these things,'" he said. "You paid the full amount of money, but if you have HIPAA requirements, now you're using less of that." When Jonathan Reichental, CIO at the Palo Alto, Calif., city government, reviewed Apps for Work two years ago, one check against it was how well the suite's work applications conformed to requirements laid out by the FBI's Criminal Justice Information Services, also known as CJIS, which gives federal, state and local agencies access to information and resources related to criminal justice and law enforcement. "When we compared Microsoft CJIS compliance with Google's, Microsoft was fully compliant whereas Google was almost there." A Google spokesman said Apps for Work was compliant with CJIS today, though notice could not be found on Google's website for government customers. Sky's the limit with work applications? As for the future of Google Apps for Work, Creese doesn't see a flood of new customers rushing in, so the office suite of work applications is likely to be a distant second to Microsoft for some time, he said. And though some big companies, such as PricewaterhouseCoopers and Motorola Solutions, will continue to make the leap to Google, many more will not. That could be because they're Microsoft shops at heart -- or because Microsoft is coming out with newer and stronger security features, a big draw for big companies. In 2015, for example, Microsoft released Customer Lockbox, which warns Office 365 customers if Microsoft needs to access their data because of, say, a government subpoena. As yet, Google hasn't matched that innovation. "If Google made some moves and talked about new products or new features, then perhaps it could grow, but at this point it's pretty steady-state -- not increasing, but not decreasing either," he said. Though Joe AbiDaoud, CIO at Toronto mining company Hudbay, yearns for continued efforts -- at Google as well as elsewhere in the tech industry -- at eliminating phishing attempts to hack into companies' computer systems, he said the Google Apps platform has improved over his four years as a customer, if incrementally. For instance, on Google Drive, a user today can restrict what an outside party does with a document that is shared. That wasn't possible in 2012. "This is a company that continuously looks at making their product better," AbiDaoud said. "And they do it in a collaborative way. They talk to their customers. It really is a benefit that is widely overlooked." The decision about which cloud-based productivity software to use is often a matter of corporate culture.

There’s no way the headline is going to live up to the promise. But the draw of finding out what happens next—crossing that curiosity gap—is just too much to resist. So you take the bait. And, sure enough, you’re disappointed. Facebook wants to stop this from happening, and it’s turning to artificial intelligence to help. Earlier this month the company announced that it was tweaking its algorithms to cut down on “clickbait”—the ubiquitous plague of Internet content that over-promises and under-delivers. But it’s a big Internet out there, and plenty of other companies and sites that could benefit from tools that can separate quality news stories from fluff. Now Facebook is open sourcing software to help filter out all that Internet noise. Facebook’s AI-driven text classification system, bag-of-tricks” approach that helps machines efficiently glean information from the order in which words appear. Another FastText tactic breaks down words into “subwords“—such as prefixes, suffixes and root words—to help computers more easily learn their meanings. Beyond clickbait, Facebook suggests software developers could use FastText to help filter out spam. It could power search engines and autocomplete fields. Recommendation engines like the ones used by the likes of Amazon or Netflix could also benefit from a little artificial smarts that can get a better read on what you’re writing. FastText is just the latest of several open source AI projects to come out of Facebook in recent years. The company has released AI algorithms, a tool for spotting bugs (in code), and designs for AI-optimized hardware. And it’s not the only tech giant doing this. Google released its AI framework TensorFlow, and companies from Microsoft and Baidu to Amazon and Yahoo have all given away the code for some of their own AI tech. That may seem like an odd trend, given that each of these companies hopes to best the other with better tech, including AI. But artificial intelligence is still a budding field. The researchers creating these technologies within companies like Facebook and Google benefit from having their counterparts on the outside review their work and suggest changes. In a sense, open sourcing code offers the same potential benefit that publishing research in peer-reviewed journals does for scientists. In other words, Facebook is betting that giving away its AI tech will make for better software, because it too can benefit from the new ways others use it. And besides, more developers and researchers learning to use the software means more coders better prepared to work for Facebook in the future. Go Back to Top.

Today the company unveiled DSSTNE (pronounced “destiny”), an open source artificial intelligence framework that the company developed to power its product recommendation system. Now any company, researcher, or curious tinkerer can use it for their own AI applications. It’s the latest in series of projects recently open sourced by large tech companies all focused on a branch of AI called deep learning. Google, Facebook, and Microsoft have mainly used these systems for tasks like image and speech recognition. But given Amazon’s core business, it’s not surprising that the online retailer’s version is devoted to selling merchandise. “We are releasing DSSTNE as open source software so that the promise of deep learning can extend beyond speech and language understanding and object recognition to other areas such as search and recommendations,” the Q&A section of Amazon’s DSSTNE GitHub page reads. “We hope that researchers around the world can collaborate to improve it. But more importantly, we hope that it spurs innovation in many more areas.” Along with the idealistic rhetoric, open sourcing AI software is a way for tech industry rivals to show off and one-up each other. When Google released its TensorFlow framework last year, it didn’t offer support for running the software across multiple servers at the same time. That meant users couldn’t speed up their AI computations by stringing together clusters of computers the same way Google could running a more advanced version of the system internally. That created an opening for other software companies like Microsoft and Yahoo to release their own open source deep learning frameworks that support distributed computing clusters. Google has since caught up, releasing a version of TensorFlow that supports clusters earlier this year. Amazon claims its system takes distribution one step further by enabling users to to spread a deep learning problem not just across multiple servers, but across multiple processors within each server. Amazon also says DSSTNE is designed to work with sparser data sets than TensorFlow and other deep learning frameworks. Google uses TensorFlow internally for tasks such as image recognition, where it can rely on the Internet’s vast store of, say, cat photos to train its AI to recognize images of cats. Amazon’s scenarios are quite different. The company does sells millions of different products. But the number of examples of how the purchase of one product relates to the purchase of another are relatively few by comparison to cats on the Internet. To make compelling recommendations—that is, to recommend products that customers are more likely to click on and buy—Amazon has a strong incentive to create a system that can make good predictions based on less data. By open sourcing DSSTNE, Amazon is increasing the likelihood that some smart person somewhere outside the company will help the company think of ways to make the system better. Go Back to Top.

Last year Google opened TensorFlow to the entire world. This meant that any individual, company, or organization could build their own AI applications using the same software that Google does to fuel  everything from photo recognition to automated email replies. But there was a catch. While Google stretches its platform across thousands of computer servers, the version it released to the public could run only on a single machine. This made TensorFlow considerably less capable for others. Google is trying to fix that deficiency now. Today the company is releasing a new version of TensorFlow, and the most notable new feature is the ability to run it on multiple machines at the same time. Not everyone needs to run TensorFlow on hundreds, let alone thousands, of servers. But many researchers and startups could will benefit from being able to run TensorFlow on multiple machines. TensorFlow technical lead Rajat Monga explains that the delay in releasing a multi-server version of TensorFlow was due to the difficulties of adapting the software to be usable outside of Google’s highly customized data centers. “Our software stack is differently internally from what people externally use,” he says. “It would have been extremely difficult to just take that and make it open source.” The TensorFlow team opted to release a more limited version last year just to get something into researchers’ hands while continuing to work on more advanced features. TensorFlow Unleashed TensorFlow is based on a branch of AI called deep learning, which draws inspiration from the way that human brain cells communicate with each other. Deep learning has become central to the machine learning efforts of other tech giants such as Facebook, Microsoft, and Yahoo, all of which are busy releasing their own AI projects into the wild. Early last year Facebook released some of the tools it uses to run the open source AI framework Torch across multiple servers. This year Microsoft open sourced its own AI framework that can run on multiple servers, and Yahoo quickly followed suit. Despite the available alternatives, TensorFlow is already surprisingly popular. It was among the six open source projects that received the most attention from developers in all of 2015, even though it was only released in November. But it’s only now that TensorFlow has been unshackled from the one-machine limit that we’ll start to really see what it’s capable of. Go Back to Top.

Getty Images Ever wished you could order Taco Bell for everyone in the office using a simple chat bot? No? Well, you’ll soon be able to it anyway. Taco Bell has blessed the world with TacoBot, a chatbot for the popular workplace chat app Slack. Tell TacoBot what you want, and it keeps a running tally of your order, just like that screen at the drive-thru. When you’re done, pay through TacoBot and pick up your order at the Nearest Participating Taco Bell. If that sounds like it would be handy for your team—or, you know, your “team”—you can join the waiting list. Be warned, though—it might be a few months before you revel in the miracle of this advance in productivity tech, says Martin Legowiecki. He’s the creative technology director at Deutsch, the agency that built TacoBot. And even after you’re in, you’ll still have to send someone with the Taco Bell app on their phone to fetch the order. So, much like the Tacocopter before it, the real bot-ified future of meat, cheese, and tortilla still hasn’t arrived. But fear not: Legowiecki says delivery is something Taco Bell is working on, too. Really Slacking TacoBot is one of the most gluttonous manifestations yet of the bot-powered future of work that many companies predict. In China, people already use the popular instant message app WeChat for all sorts of daily tasks, from checking their bank balances to ordering cabs to buying sneakers. Silicon Valley entrepreneurs are betting that chatbots will replace apps here in the US, too. Slack, with competitors like Hipchat, hope this chat revolution won’t just change consumer behavior but the way work gets done at corporations with lots of money to spend on office supplies, company lunches, and whatever else big companies spend their budgets on. Slack is taking this so seriously that last year it said that it would invest $80 million in companies that build Slack bots. That vision of the future aside, TacoBot came about almost by accident. Deutsch was contracted by Taco Bell to redesign the company’s website, Legowiecki says. During the course of that project, the Taco Bell and Deutsch teams worked together using Slack. “They fell in love with it, we fell in love with it,” Legowiecki says. “So we though wouldn’t it be great to make Taco Bell available through Slack?” The Deutsch team built TacoBot using Wit.ai, an online service for building software that’s able understand and respond to human language. (Facebook bought Wit.ai last year to help build its virtual assistant M.) Legowiecki says this means it will be able to bring TacoBot to other apps in the future, such as Hipchat, Facebook Messenger, Amazon Echo, even Apple TV. In other words, food bots are coming, whether you want them or not. As if you need another excuse to hit the drive-thru. Go Back to Top.

Black Friday 2016 TV Deals Frequent Flier Miles Are Kaput—The Game's About Credit Cards Now 3 Facebook is now using artificial intelligence to automatically generate captions for photos in the News Feed of people who can’t see them. The tool is called Automatic Alternative Text, and it dovetails with text-to-speech engines that allow blind people to use Facebook in other ways. Using deep neural networks, the system can identify particular objects in a photo, from cars and boats to ice cream and pizza. It can pick out particular characteristics of the people in the photo, including smiles and beards and eyeglasses. And it can analyze a photo in a more general sense, determining that a photo depicts sun or ocean waves or snow. The text-to speech engine will then “read” these things aloud. Matt King. Facebook A Facebook employee named Matt King showed me a prototype of the service last fall. King, 49, is blind, and though he acknowledged that the service was far from perfect, he said it was a notable improvement over the the status quo. He wasn’t wrong. King showed the system a photo of a friend and his bike as he traveled through Europe. Facebook’s AI described the scene as outdoors. It said the photo included grass and trees and clouds, and that the scene was near water. If the photo had turned up in his News Feed in the past, King would have known only that his friend had posted a photo. “My dream is that it would also tell me that it includes Christoph with his bike,” King told me. “But from my perspective as a blind user, going from essentially zero percent satisfaction from a photo to somewhere in the neighborhood of half … is a huge jump.” As King told me, the system doesn’t always get things right. And it hasn’t yet reached a point where it generates captions in full and complete sentences. But this will come. Others have already used deep neural nets to do much the same thing. As King pointed out, a service that only gets part of the way there is still important now—Facebook says that more than 50,000 people already are using the service with text-to-speech engines.

Now, right on cue, Apple has acquired Emotient, a startup that uses artificial intelligence to analyze your facial expressions and read your emotions. First reported by The Wall Street Journal, the deal is notable because, well, it’s Apple, the world’s most valuable company and one of the most powerful tech giants. It’s unclear how Apple intends to use the company, but as Moore indicates, the tech built by Emotient is part of much larger trend across the industry. Using what are called deep neural networks—vast networks of hardware and software that approximate the web of neurons in the human brain—companies like Google and Facebook are working on similar face recognition technology and have already rolled it into their online services. ‘There are huge implications in terms of making dialogue with computers much more meaningful.’ “We have very real data points showing computers doing a better job than humans in accessing emotional states,” Moore said in December. “There are huge implications in terms of making dialogue with computers much more meaningful.” Moore points our that such technology can be used for everything from security to accessing mental heath. As the Journal explains, Emotient sold its tech to advertisers, letting them analyze how consumers responded to their ads. According to the startup, doctors have also used the technology to determine patient pain, and retailers have used it to track how shoppers react to products in stores. With deep neural nets, machines can learn to do certain tasks by analyzing large amounts of data. If you feed enough photos of someone smiling into a neural net, for instance, it can learn to understand when someone is happy. And these techniques can be applied to more than just images. They have also proved successful with speech recognition and, to a certain extent, natural language understanding. Google and Facebook and Microsoft are at the forefront of this deep learning movement. But Apple been pushing in the same direction. In the fall, Apple acquired a startup called VocalIQ, which uses deep neural nets for speech recognition. You might not be able to hide your true feelings from Siri for much longer. Go Back to Top.

Cade Metz Business Date of Publication: 12.11.15. 12.11.15 Time of Publication: 7:09 pm. 7:09 pm Elon Musk Snags Top Google Researcher for New AI Non-Profit Tesla founder Elon Musk, big-name venture capitalist Peter Thiel, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, and several other notable tech names have launched a new artificial intelligence startup called OpenAI, assembling a particularly impressive array of AI talent that includes a top researcher from Google. But the idea, ostensibly, isn’t to make money. Overseen by ex-Googler Ilya Sutskever and Greg Brockman, the former CTO of high-profile payments startup Stripe, OpenAI has the talent to compete with the industry’s top artificial intelligence outfits, including Google and Facebook—but the company has been setup as a non-profit. “Our goal is to advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return,” Brockman said in a blog post. The apparent aim is to build systems based on deep learning, a form of artificial intelligence that has proven extremely adept in recent years at identifying images, recognizing spoken words, translating from one language to another, and, to a certain extent, understanding the natural way that we humans talk. Sutskever is a protege of Geoff Hinton, one of the founding fathers of the deep learning movement, who now works for Google. Deep learning relies on what are called neural networks, vast networks of machines that approximate the networks of neurons in the human brain. Feed enough photos of a cat into a neural net, and it can learn to identify a cat. Feed enough dialogue into a neural net, and it can learn to carry on a pretty good, if sometimes dodgy, conversation. The hope is that top researchers can take this much further. Some believe the method can even be used to mimic human common sense. Currently, companies like Google and Facebook and Microsoft sit at the forefront of this movement. But OpenAI aims push the state of the art forward without worrying about financial gain. Instead, they intend to open source their work, freely sharing it with the world at large. Recently, Google open sourced the core software engine, TensorFlow, that drives its deep learning services, and just this week, Facebook open sourced its deep learning hardware. They too are looking to advance the technology through widespread collaboration. But you have to wonder if they made these moves because they knew OpenAI was on the way. OpenAI certainly has the pedigree to make some serious headway in the field. Musk and Thiel are co-chairs of the company. Other backers include Alan Kay, one of the founding fathers of the PC, and Yoshua Bengio, another top deep learning researcher. Altogether, OpenAI says, its backers have committed $1 billion to the project. Sometimes you have to spend money, even if you don’t plan on making any. Go Back to Top.

All it took was supplying millions of examples so that the company’s software—based on a branch of artificial intelligence called deep learning—could start recognizing the difference between cats and other furry creatures. But Jeremy Howard wants to use deep learning for something a little more practical: diagnosing illnesses. And he’s finally getting his chance. Today Howard’s company, Enlitic, said it was going to start working with Capitol Health Limited, a radiology clinic with locations across Australia, to have its software look at X-rays. Enlitic won’t replace radiologists. Instead, the software is designed to help them do their jobs more quickly and make fewer mistakes. First, it checks each file submitted to make sure the image matches what the technicians say it’s supposed to be—for example, it makes sure that if an image is tagged as a left knee that it’s not actually a right knee. Then, it looks for anomalies in the image. Depending on what it finds, it assigns a priority to the X-ray and routes it to a radiologist. For example, if it finds nodules on an image of a pair of lungs, it will assign it a high-priority status and route it to a pulmonary radiologist. If it detects what appears to be an aneurysm, it will route the X-ray to a cardiovascular radiologist instead. If it finds no anomalies, it will mark it as low priority. After a radiologist has reviewed the image, the software will help write the paperwork by auto-generating text for some of the more tedious parts of a report. More Deep Learning Intel Is Building Artificial Smarts Right Into Its Chips Facebook’s AI Can Caption Photos for the Blind on Its Own Artificial Intelligence Is Now Telling Doctors How to Treat You Enlitic’s X-ray algorithms are just the latest example of deep learning being put to practical use. Facebook is now using deep learning techniques to caption photos for the blind. Yelp recently explained how it’s using deep learning to optimize what photos it shows on restaurant listings. And similar techniques are also part of what powers Microsoft’s Skype Translate. And Enlitic isn’t the only company trying to apply artificial intelligence to medicine. IBM’s Watson has been used for research at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and more recently to provide diet and exercise advice. The app Bright.md aims to help physicians speed up routine appointments. But Enlitic’s deal appears to be one of the biggest real-world tests of deep learning’s ability to aid medical diagnostics. Eventually, Howard hopes the technology will help expand access to medical diagnostics as Capital Health begins opening clinics in Asia. He cites World Economic Forum report that forecasts a severe shortage of medical experts in the developing world if training programs aren’t accelerated. With any luck, artificial intelligence can shoulder some of that burden. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

Through acquisitions of companies like Indisys, Xtremeinsights, and perhaps most importantly, fellow chip maker Altera (a $16.7 billion deal), Intel has devoted much its artificial intelligence efforts on baking AI into its into chips, as well as software that powers its 3-D video cameras. Today, Intel has added yet more AI to its portfolio with the purchase of Saffron Technology. Like many other AI startups, Saffron attempts to extract useful information from huge datasets via algorithms inspired in part on the way the human brain works. But instead of focusing on deep learning, the trendy branch of AI in which Google and Facebook are heavily investing, Saffron is focused its own technique called associative memory. The company was founded in 1999 by former IBM Knowledge Management and Intelligent Agent Center chief scientist Manuel Aparicio and led by former PeopleSoft executive Gayle Sheppard. It has deep roots in the enterprise software industry and cut its teeth selling software to the Department of Defense, such as a system for predicting the likely location of roadside bombs in Iraq. “We see an opportunity to apply cognitive computing not only to high-powered servers crunching enterprise data, but also to new consumer devices that need to see, sense, and interpret complex information in real time,” Intel New Technology Group Senior Vice President Josh Walden says. “Big data can happen on small devices, as long as they’re smart enough and connected.” Go Back to Top.

The company says the self-driving Volvo XC90 cars will have human backup drivers to begin with, but the move will surely worry the country's 327,000 Uber drivers who will eventually be replaced by autonomous vehicles. Uber co-founder and chief executive officer Travis Kalanick has said that the company's goal is to replace human drivers with driverless vehicles as 'quickly as possible'. The $300million Volvo deal will provide SUVs to Uber and see vehicles outfitted with cameras, lasers and sensors to help them navigate the city's streets. An unspecified number of autonomous Ford Fusions will also pick up passengers. Scroll down for video  Uber says it will also start hauling passengers with self-driving Volvo CX90 cars. But the company said they will also have back-up drivers END OF HUMANS BEHIND THE WHEEL?  As autonomous vehicle technology improves, it's easy to imagine a world where these vehicles have no need for a human operator which would have a huge impact on those who driving for a living. Uber co-founder and chief executive officer Travis Kalanick plans to turn his fleet driverless as quickly as possible. 'We are going commercial,' he says in an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek. 'This can't just be about science.' There are 327,000 Uber drivers in the US, according to Business Insider.  According to the latest statistics from the American Trucking Association there are over 3million truck drivers across the nation. Other statistics from the Bureau of Labor show there are 180,960 taxi drivers, 168,620 transit bus drivers and 505,560 school bus drivers.  The Volvo has 22 camera lenses, a laser on the roof and laser sensors at the corners.  Its cameras, sensors and laser can see more than 100 meters in all directions.  John Bares, who had run Carnegie Mellon University's National Robotics Engineering Center for 13 years before founding Carnegie Robotics, spent seven years researching autonomous robots and says Uber co-founder and chief executive officer Travis Kalanick approached him to help turn the fleet driverless as quickly as possible. 'Travis had an idea that he wanted to do self-driving,' says Bares in an interview with Bloomberg.   To some the plan may seem reckless but Kalanick begs to differ.  'We are going commercial,' he says in an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek.  'This can't just be about science.' Uber has set up a self-driving research lab in Pittsburgh to work on the driverless technology. With the growth of autonomous vehicle technology, it's easy to imagine a world where these vehicles have no need for a person behind the wheel and could therefore see the four million Americans who drive for a living needing out of work. There are three million truck drivers in the US, 180,960 taxi drivers, 168,620 transit bus drivers and 505,560 school bus drivers.  Volvo Cars has so far delivered a handful of vehicles out of a total of 100 due by the end of the year, according to Bloomberg.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Shocking dashcam footage shows driver who had already been...

Volvo's self driving system in action: Volvo Cars has so far delivered a handful of vehicles out of a total of 100 due by the end of the year Both Uber and Volvo will use the same base vehicle for the next stage of their own autonomous car strategies.  This will involve Uber adding its own self-developed autonomous driving systems to the Volvo base vehicle.  Volvo will use the same base vehicle for the next stage of its own autonomous car strategy, which will involve fully autonomous driving.  'In the last six years we’ve seen the profound impact that smartphone technology has had on transportation, as well as the delivery business, wrote Uber's Kalanick announcing the deal. Uber employees test self-driving Ford Fusion hybrid cars in Pittsburgh today. The firm has been using Ford vehicles to test its system. Uber employees had the chance to get behind the wheel and test the self-driving Ford Fusion hybrid car, pictured, today  'When people can push a button and reliably get an affordable ride across town, things change for the better—and quickly. 'Of course, this is just the start, especially when it comes to safety.  'Over one million people die on the world’s roads every year and 90 percent of these accidents are due to human error.  'In the US, traffic accidents are a leading cause of death for people under 25.  'This is a tragedy that self-driving technology can help solve.  'By combining Uber’s self-driving technology with Volvo’s state-of-the art vehicles and safety technology, we’ll get to the future faster than going it alone.' Uber will purchase Volvos and then install its own driverless control system for the specific needs of its service.  'Autonomous driving is key. For this you need software to develop and be safe,' Volvo chief executive Hakan Samuelsson said. Volvo will use the same vehicle for its own autonomous driving project, which is based on a plan that still envisages having a driver in the car.  Uber is also working with other automakers - and currently uses Ford Fusions in its test fleet.  Video courtesy: WPXI  The investment will go towards researching and developing both hardware, such as sensors used to detect traffic and obstacles, as well as software for the self driving cars. Uber employees stand by self-driving Ford Fusion hybrid cars during testing of the vehicles The car has 22 camera lenses, a laser on the roof and laser sensors at the corners. The self-driving cars that Volvo is envisioning will be like normal cars that alert the driver when autopilot mode can be activated, on freeways or in specific zones such as gated neighborhoods or industrial parks, giving the driver the option to maintain or relinquish control.  UBER BUYS SELF DRIVING TRUCK FIRM  The US ride-sharing service Uber also announced Thursday it had acquired the commercial transport-focused tech startup Otto as the company presses ahead with its pursuit of self-driving technology.  'If that sounds like a big deal - well, it is,' Uber CEO Travis Kalanick said in a statement. 'In order to provide digital services in the physical world, we must build sophisticated logistics, artificial intelligence and robotics systems that serve and elevate humanity.' By the end of the year, small owner-operators and larger commercial partners will begin using Otto's self-driving kit developed by ex-Google employees. Anthony Levandowski, the co-founder of Otto, a 90-person startup, will now lead Uber's efforts to develop self-driving technology for personal driving, delivery and trucking in Palo Alto, California, San Francisco and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Otto is aiming to equip trucks with software, sensors, lasers and cameras so they eventually will be able to navigate the more than 220,000 miles of U.S. highways on their own, while a human driver naps in the back of the cab or handles other tasks. For now, the robot truckers would only take control on the highways, leaving humans to handle the tougher task of wending through city streets.  Driverless cars, also known as autonomous, self-driving or robotic can sense the environment and navigate without human input. The vehicles use a variety of techniques such as radar, lidar - like radar but using lights from a laser, GPS, odometry, and computer vision. UBER'S SELF-DRIVING CAR PLANS  Google's self-driving car may own the streets on the west coast, but Uber has staked its claim on the east - meaning its nearly half million drivers may need to look for other work.  The hybrid Ford Fusions, complete with Uber logos, will soon be seen mapping Pittsburgh, testing its self-driving capabilities on public streets.  Uber is also working with other automakers - and currently uses Ford Fusions in its test fleet Not only does the San Francisco- based firm believe self-driving cars are the way of the future, it says this technology has the potential 'to save millions of lives and improve quality of life for people around the world'. Volvo and Uber also announced a $300million deal on Thursday for Volvo to provide SUVs to Uber for autonomous vehicle research. Pictured is a Volvo concept car that will eventually be a part of the self-driving fleet in Pittsburgh '1.3 million people die every year in car accidents — 94 per cent of those accidents involve human error,' Uber shared in a press release. 'In the future we believe this technology will mean less congestion, more affordable and accessible transportation, and far fewer lives lost in car accidents,' the company added. It also uses systems to interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths, as well as obstacles and relevant signage.  Using self-driving vehicles means companies such as Uber would make drastic savings on their biggest cost - paying drivers - if they were able to incorporate self-driving cars into their fleet. For the carmakers themselves, the ability of consumers to hail a cab via an app or hire a car by the hour risks putting them off buying their own vehicle. Toyota Motor Co has said it is investing an undisclosed sum in Uber, while German rival Volkswagen has said it will back Gett, a ride-hailing company.  General Motors has already acquired a stake in Uber's rival, Lyft. THE RACE TO SELF DRIVING CARS: UBER'S COMPETITION One of Google's self driving prototype 'bubble' cars Google's self-driving car In 2009, Google started the self-driving car project.  The testing fleet includes both modified Lexus SUVs and new prototype vehicles that are designed from the ground up to be fully self-driving.  Google's prototype two-seater 'bubble' cars have buttons to begin and end the drive, but no other controls. An on-board computer uses data from sensors, including radar, a laser and cameras, to make turns and negotiate its way around pedestrians and other vehicles. Under the vision unveiled by Google, passengers might set their destination by typing it into a map or using commands. Apple's iCar A concept video reveals ideas for a futuristic-looking Apple car, with a wide dashboard display and smart capabilities. The video from ConceptsiPhone boasts that the 2020 vehicle design is 'more than a car,' with connectivity to other Apple devices. The concept by Luca Wrede shows a build that mirrors the minimalist design common to Apple products. A wraparound dashboard screen shows speed, traffic predictions, and answers calls. The vehicle can pull up Apple Maps, Safari, and Siri, which are indicated all on the interactive dashboard. The concept car can even connect to the Apple Watch.  LEECo's LeSEE China's LeEco has unveiled an electric autonomous vehicle that it says will surpass Tesla's Model S in 'all aspects of performance'. Dubbed LeSEE, the sleek pearly white sedan has memory foam seats, Knight Rider-style voice activation, an automatic driving mode and a steering wheel that folds toward the dash when the car is set to autopilot. This futuristic concept car was engineered to be a 'smart', 'connected' and 'automated self-driving car' and the firm hopes it will set the stage for a fleet of autonomous taxis.  Although Uber's competitor Lyft stated it is dabbling in self-driving taxis, it won't have anything to show for it until next year. The program will use Chevrolet Bolt electric taxis and 'included customers in a yet-to-be disclosed city' General Motors & Lyft's autonomous Taxis General Motors announced a $500 million investment in Lyft earlier this year as a joint effort to develop a fleet of self-driving taxis. Although the idea seemed like a distant dream, the duo has announced plans for a testing program on public roads by 2017. The program will use Chevrolet Bolt electric taxis and 'include real customers in a yet-to-be disclosed city'.   In addition to the testing program, Lyft is working on a new app that will be used for the autonomous cars.  The app is still a prototype, but will list the option for an autonomous car and there is a GM OnStar assistant to answer questions or report issues while you're en route to your destination.  Read more: Uber doubles its drivers in 2015 - Business Insider American Trucking Associations Self Driving Cars Endanger Millions of American Jobs (And That’s Okay) Bus Drivers, Transit and Intercity Uber’s First Self-Driving Fleet Arrives in Pittsburgh This Month - Bloomberg Uber’s First Self-Driving Fleet Arrives in Pittsburgh This Month - Bloomberg Uber testing driverless cars in Pittsburgh | WPXI Share or comment on this article e-mail 465 shares Most watched News videos Gruesome moment Korean chef dissects a LIVE octopus Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Teen films a burning 'meteorite' moving across sky in Japan Shocking moment man hits women in mass chicken shop fight Tidal surge filmed on Sunaoshi River in Tagajo, Japan The moment a 7.4 magnitude earthquake hit Fukushima Supermodel Gigi Hadid fights off man who grabs her at Milan show Kim Kardashian attacked in Paris by notorious prankster Doorman knocks-out troublemaker during two-on-one confrontation Mystery homeless woman in Rome avoids questions from reporter 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob Boyfriend plays awful snake prank on his sleeping girlfriend REVEALED: Number of Hamilton stars haven't voted in YEARS...

ITProPortal Search RSS News Features Analysis Guides Reviews Categories Business Hardware Security Software Mobile Enterprise Cloud Networks Public Sector Startups Web Google Classroom gets updated before new school year By Sead Fadilpašić Shares Google has released an update to its Classroom platform, just before the start of the new school year. It brings a couple of innovations for teachers and students, but more importantly – it’s bringing someone else into the fold, and I don’t think students are going to like this one very much. But let’s get the formalities out of the way, first. The new version of the Classroom mobile app now allows both teachers and students to annotate documents, which makes collaboration outside the classroom somewhat easier and more seamless. The way teachers manage activity streams has also been changed a bit. Google Forms now also allows adding images to questions, as well as multiple-choice answers. But the main change is that teachers can now add parents and guardians to the app, allowing them to receive either daily, or weekly updates on their kids’ progress. In other news, Google’s next-gen email platform, Inbox by Gmail, is now available to users of Google for Education. Expeditions is also getting a bunch of new features. The virtual reality app now has more than 200 virtual reality experiences. “As any teacher would tell you, the classroom isn’t the only place where learning happens — it’s just the tip of the iceberg,” Google said in a blog post, announcing the changes. “From parents who help students with homework, to extracurriculars, field trips and more, there are so many ways students can learn beyond the walls of the classroom. This is why today we’re announcing new features to help teachers inspire learning for students, regardless of place or time.” Topics classroom education google innovation platform school Load Comments GET YOUR FREE MAGAZINE NET: The Money Issue worth £5.99 Join over 7000 ITProPortal subscribers!

Heads up, parents: With back-to-school season upon us, Google is updating its educational products with some new features designed to take learning beyond the classroom. For starters, the Web giant on Wednesday launched a new feature in Google Classroom that automatically shares summaries of student work with parents. Once invited by a teacher, parents and guardians can receive automated daily or weekly email summaries of student work and class announcements, so they can stay on top of their kid's education. "As any teacher would tell you, the classroom isn't the only place where learning happens — it's just the tip of the iceberg," Google Classroom Software Engineer Dina Kachintseva and User Experience Designer Felix Wang wrote in a blog post. "Parent participation has a major impact on student learning." Another new feature launching this week lets teachers and students annotate documents in the Classroom mobile app. "This gives students a portable classroom whiteboard on which they can easily draw and sketch," Kachintseva and Wang wrote. //Related Articles The Best Chromebooks of 2016 Students can, for instance, "sketch out math problems or even create visuals of creative ideas directly on their devices" while teachers can use annotations to quickly grade assignments by writing directly on the student's work, or highlight specific passages. On top of that, Google is launching some new Expeditions letting students take virtual trips to Bhutan and explore the human vascular systems. The Expeditions app will also "soon" arrive on iOS, so those with iPads can leverage the tool in full-screen mode, sans VR viewer. There are now more than 200 Expeditions available. Finally, teachers can now organize the Classroom class stream by adding topics to posts, and teachers and students can filter the stream for specific topics. You can also now add images to Google Forms questions or as multiple choice answers. Plus, Cast for Education is now available to all teachers and students, and Inbox by Gmail is rolling out to all Google for Education users.

While the messaging service Allo is yet to be made available, Google Duo has been launched for both the platforms. It can be said that the Google Duo is Google's answer to FaceTime from Apple. It makes video calling between Android phones and iPhones very simple. Google Duo is an intuitive app that can be used by both Android and iPhone users. Also Read: Google unveils end-to-end encrypted video calling app Well, Google Duo can be downloaded on your smartphone for free and it doesn't require any complex registration process. All you need to do is just register your mobile number and use the video calling app with ease. Also Read: Google aiming for drones with projectors for virtual meetings Go through the slider below to know the highlighted features of the Google Duo app. It is quite promising and it might make you want to video chat with your family and friends. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates! Duo doesn't need a Google account There's no worry even if you don't have a Google account as the Google Duo doesn't ask you one. You just have to sign up with your phone number and you will get a verification code SMS for authentication purposes. You can see previews with Knock Knock The Knock Knock feature is a unique one in Google Duo. With this feature, you can get a preview of the caller before the person on the other end can see you. If you are making the call, you will see a notice that says that your video will be visible to the person on the other end. Eventually, the person you are calling to can see what exactly you are doing at that moment. The Android users can see the caller even on the lock screen, but iOS users don't get this feature as they have to unlock the phone and keep the app ready to see the caller before answering. You can block a person on Google Duo Fortunately, there is an option to block any contact from calling you on Google Duo. However, the contact you have blocked on Duo will not know about it and when they call you, they will just hear continuous rings. No worry! You can disable Knock Knock The Knock Knock feature might worry you as the person on the other line might see you in real time before answering your call. Of course, you can receive Knock Knock only from people who are in your contact list and you also have the ability to block anyone from calling you. Anyways, if Knock Knock isn't your cup of tea, you can disable it from the Settings menu of Duo. But, remember that you cannot disable Knock Knock on a per contact basis. It will be Knock Knock for either all or for no one. Video calls are end-to-end encrypted Google Duo is built on WebRTC that is a standard that lets video, voice and P2P file transfers without the use of software or plugins. Your video chats are end-to-end encrypted, so there is no worry about anyone spying on you and your calls. Google cannot decrypt the content of the calls even if the government insists.

Ask Plato Steven Poole The debate we are now having about the effect of constant internet access on memory and creativity has precedents thousands of years old ‘There is a view that smartphones, as well as notebooks, are literally parts of our minds when we are using them to think. We are all cyborgs already.’ Photograph: Michael Gottschalk/Photothek via Getty Images Thursday 18 August 2016 11.00 EDT Last modified on Thursday 13 October 2016 16.04 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Does anyone know anything any more? The ease with which one can look up facts on a phone at any time is one of the wonders of the modern age. But are we becoming too reliant on it? A new study indicates, at least, that there might be a snowball effect to such reliance. The more we depend on Google for information recall, it suggests, the more we will do so in the future. In a paper for the journal Memory, psychologists Benjamin Storm, Sean Stone, and Aaron Benjamin describe how they first asked people a set of difficult trivia questions. One group was told to use Google to answer them; the other group attempted to answer them from memory. Next, all the subjects were given a set of easier trivial questions, and offered the choice of using Google or not. It turned out that the ones who had previously used Google were more likely to choose to use it again this time – even if it was made significantly more inconvenient to do so. Thus, it seems, “relying on the internet to access information makes one more likely to rely on the internet to access other information”. It would be unreasonable to extrapolate from these results the conclusion that, over time, no one will bother remembering anything at all. But such evidence may still come as grist to the mill of those who have long been asking “Is Google making us stupid?” The answer, of course, depends among other things on what “stupid” means. If we all come to increase our “cognitive offloading” onto the internet, that may simply portend a cultural shift in the ways in which we value mental abilities. Since recall of facts is now so easy and quick via the internet, we may just become less impressed by factual knowledge, and more impressed by understanding and creativity. The problem with this, as the researchers themselves note, is that the ability to draw creative connections between facts may depend on having internalized them already as knowledge, so that they are instantly available to the reasoning mind. Until we have direct brain connections to the internet, it is still far more laborious to look everything up about a topic one wants to think about. Plus, to look something up, one needs to know already what it is one wants to know. Those who cleave to what is known as the “extended cognition” or “extended mind” argument, on the other hand, hold that a lot of our mental processes already happen outside the brain anyway: there is a view that smartphones, as well as notebooks, are literally parts of our minds when we are using them to think. We are all cyborgs already, and that is the natural progression of things. Why worry? It may help put things in perspective to recall that an argument of this sort was already being conducted at the very birth of western culture. In Plato’s Phaedrus, Socrates tells the story of the ancient Egyptian god Theuth, who invented the arts of mathematics, astronomy, and writing. Theuth went to the Egyptian king, Thamus, to show him his inventions and explain why they were useful. He was particularly proud of writing: “This invention, O king, will make the Egyptians wiser and will improve their memories; for it is an elixir of memory and wisdom that I have discovered.” But the king thought the opposite. Writing, he argued, would “produce forgetfulness in the minds of those who learn to use it, because they will not practice their memory … Their trust in writing, produced by external characters which are no part of themselves, will discourage the use of their own memory within them. You have invented an elixir not of memory, but of reminding.” And this will, he fears, result on those who rely on writing never being “wise”. For “writing” read “Google” and you have much of the burden of current worries about how use of the internet may be degrading our minds. Writing itself is just as much an external prosthetic technology (“characters which are no part of themselves,” as the Egyptian king complains) as the internet is. Writing is also a tool of extended cognition. The difference is that we have had thousands of years to get used to it. The truth about the question of whether our reliance on modern electronic prostheses is better or worse for us is that it’s simply too early to tell.

ABI Research finds that video equipment will see a 4% CAGR through 2021, while Managed Video Platforms (MVPs) focused on providing turnkey service offerings and delivering media & entertainment content will see a 17% CAGR in the same period. Logo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151014/276887LOGO "A value chain shift within the video market led to hardware stagnation, with traditional broadcast and network-adjacent video components taking a back seat," says Sam Rosen, Managing Director and Vice President at ABI Research. "Video delivery demands are not lessening, but instead leaving strong growth opportunities for Content Delivery Networks and service-based platforms to fill the gap." Some notable merger and acquisition activity supports this push towards video distribution ownership. Google's acquisition of Anvato helps to position the Google Cloud platform much more favorably against Microsoft's Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS). AT&T's Quickplay acquisition also highlights the company's trend towards pure Over the Top video services. Amazon's Video Direct self-service video platform and NBC Sports Digital's Playmaker Media both serve to expand existing video distribution platforms to include wider swaths of content. Encoders and transcoders continue to experience a product to service shift similar to the overall market, but remain a strong sector of the equipment space, showing approximately 14% CAGR through 2021. In encoding, Ericsson's Envivio acquisition and Harmonic's Thomson Video Networks acquisition further reduced the number of standalone video delivery players. "As the video service provider market continues to consolidate, those involved will begin looking for next steps to stay competitive," concludes Rosen. "New video formats such as 360-degree video and interactive content will escalate delivery complexity, bringing along increased network requirements including reducing latency. Properly mixing technology and service, together with signing partnerships mixing wholesale distribution with retail presence will be important for competitiveness."

SUBSCRIBE Getting to the bottom of Google expanded text ad CTR and CPC Google has rolled out expanded text ads to all advertisers, so how does this new ad format compare to standard text ads? Columnist Andy Taylor shares some data from a recent Merkle study. Andy Taylor on August 18, 2016 at 9:45 am More Since July 26, 2016, expanded text ads (ETAs) have been live in AdWords. This new ad format, which was launched with mobile users in mind, allows advertisers to create longer text ads with two headlines of up to 30 characters each and a single 80-character description line. Standard text ad (left) vs. expanded text ad (right) Advertisers have been testing the new format alongside standard text ads, and dozens of analyses looking at click-through rate (CTR) for standard vs. expanded text ads have been published across the industry, with varying levels of detail. (Google’s July announcement also came with its own assortment of impressive case studies touting massive CTR spikes.) We even included some data points in our Q2 Digital Marketing Report, though we now have much more data to work with in establishing meaningful comparisons. Here, I hope to provide the deepest look yet at how CTR differs for ETAs using data from dozens of large Merkle advertisers using the new format across thousands of ad groups. The details of our own results will hopefully also shed light on why so many in the industry are reporting such wildly different performance, and how you should view ETAs moving forward. Segmentation. Is. Everything. As I argued in a column last month, the key to any good paid search analysis is segmenting the data in meaningful ways. And is that ever the case with ETAs! Analysis pitting CTR for expanded vs. standard text ads needs to be done at the ad group level, brand vs. non-brand, by device, and looking at Google.com separately from search partners. Performance also needs to be segmented by whether ads were shown at the top of the page vs. the bottom of the page. (Hat tip to Martin Roettgerding for being the first to publish data segmented by page location.) To explain, I’ll just dive right in with the chart below, which shows CTR difference for brand and non-brand ads based on ad location (top of page vs. bottom of page). Results are based on the median ad group studied for each segment (in order to prevent the highest traffic ad groups from skewing the results) and includes only ad groups with significant impressions for both expanded text ads and standard text ads during the month of July. Note: Brand bottom of page performance is not included due to thin data, since most brand impressions occur at the top of the page in position 1.   As you can see, top-of-page expanded text ads for brand keywords are performing between three percent and five percent worse than top-of-page standard text ads for the median ad group. It’s not immediately clear why there would be worse CTR with the new format for brand ads, and the difference in CTR is slight enough to suggest that there might not be any real difference for brand ads once ETAs have more time to run. For non-brand ads appearing at the top of the page, click-through rates are similar for standard text ads vs. ETAs. Ads for all device types in the median ad group are performing within a two-percent difference in click-through rate. Looking at the distribution of ad groups by how different expanded text ad CTR is from that of standard text ads, we see a typical normal distribution centered on ad groups with a less than five percent difference either way. Given the traffic volume of the ad groups studied and the average CTR, the distribution of results is roughly what we would expect. There are plenty of ad groups seeing rather large differences in CTR between ETA and standard text ads, both positive and negative, helping to explain the wide scope of results reported thus far (assuming reported results adequately segmented data to produce meaningful comparisons, which is a big assumption given the complexity of analyzing these differences). However, the distribution is such that ad groups are seeing CTR differences roughly in line with what we would expect based on statistical chance. On the other hand, with a median CTR lift of six to eight percent across device types, non-brand ads at the bottom of the page are more consistently seeing a higher click-through rate with ETAs than with standard text ads across device types. Taking a look at the distribution of ad groups by CTR difference bucket, we find that results are skewed heavily towards ad groups that see more than a 50 percent higher click-through rate with ETAs. Thus, to understand the impact of ETAs, splitting out non-brand performance by bottom-of-page vs. top-of-page impressions is vital. This can also explain why some advertisers are seeing big gains with ETAs for non-brand, while others aren’t. It may be as simple as the share of impressions coming from ads at the bottom of the page vs. the top of the page. Why the difference in CTR by location on page? Given that the ETAs and standard ads studied are very similar (They’re from the same advertisers with similar changes made to the text in upgrading to ETAs), the difference in performance seems to indicate that something is different about the auctions and/or competitive landscape of ads featured at the top vs. the bottom. For example, perhaps standard text ads at the top of the page are more likely than those at the bottom to have the description line 1 brought up into the headline, making these ads more aesthetically similar to the new ETAs. Unfortunately, we can’t analyze how often description line 1 is brought up to the headline by page location with data from AdWords. The same goes for myriad other variables that might be causing the difference in CTR. As we don’t know what’s driving the difference, it’s difficult to guess if this higher CTR has staying power. In the big scheme of things, however, top-of-page ads account for about 80 percent of all non-brand Google.com text ad clicks for Merkle advertisers, so higher CTR for bottom-of-page ads doesn’t stand to impact overall ad traffic volume much moving forward. With differences in CTR, we might expect differences in cost per click (CPC) for expanded text ads vs. standard text ads as well. Indeed there are, though not in the direction we might expect. Expanded text ads operating at lower CPC despite lower CTR Expanded text ads appear to be operating at a slightly lower CPC than standard text ads across the board. This is a bit counterintuitive, since ETAs are underperforming standard text ads in terms of CTR for brand ads at the top of the page, and the two formats are performing roughly identically for non-brand ads at the top of the page. With expected CTR included in Google’s Quality Score calculations, lower CTR should cause the price of traffic to go up, and similar CTRs should result in similar CPCs. That doesn’t appear to be the case thus far and, like the case of higher CTRs for bottom of page non-brand ads, is another mystery we don’t have all the clues to solve. So, what does all this mean for advertisers? Takeaways for marketers First and foremost, marketers should be questioning the data they’re looking at and the ETA case studies being published. Is it possible your ads or those of industry writers are seeing two or three times higher CTR with ETAs than with standard text ads? Sure. Is it more probable that those comparisons are just the result of statistical chance and/or aggregation hiding underlying variables? Definitely. As such, it’s vital to look at ETA performance at the most granular level possible and to look at impressive case study results with a critical eye. Also, if your ETAs are underperforming standard text ads, know that you’re not alone. Plenty of advertisers are seeing the same, and it may just be a matter of early data, statistical chance, and/or what share of your traffic is coming from ads at the bottom of the page compared to the top. Long term, we do expect ETAs to produce a better CTR than standard text ads, if for no other reason than Google has rarely (never?) rolled out text ad updates which ultimately hurt the likelihood of searchers clicking ads. At the very least, we should expect the CTR of ETAs to be on par with that of standard text ads when Google eventually sunsets the older format.

The company said it plans to have a fully autonomous vehicle – no steering wheel, no gas or brake pedals – available by 2021 for ride-hailing services. “We see the autonomous car changing the way the world moves once again,” Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields said today at Ford’s research lab in Palo Alto, California. “They address a whole host of safety, social and environmental issues.” Like Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Ford will skip the interim steps of driver-assisted technology as a way to evolve toward full autonomy. Its plan to deploy self-driving cars in ride-hailing and ride-sharing fleets is similar to what General Motors Co. aims to do with Lyft Inc. Ford’s 2021 scheduled start matches BMW’s ambitious timeframe. “We believe in our plan that taking the driver out of the loop is really important,” Fields said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. The automaker couldn’t find a sensible way through the “no-man’s land” – determining exactly when a robotic car should to try to re-engage a human driver in an emergency. The second-biggest U.S. automaker didn’t say how many autonomous cars it plans to produce by 2021. Earlier Tuesday, Ford said it’s doubling the number of people at the Silicon Valley lab to 260 while expanding to two more buildings. It also invested $75 million in the leading maker of an advanced radar system to accelerate its development of self-driving cars. There’s some catching up to do: Google’s self-driving car project has already amassed 1.8 million miles of public road testing. Ford said today it’s investing in or collaborating with four startups on autonomous vehicles, bringing its roster of such partnerships to 40. Ford’s plan lacks specifics of how it will make this great leap to full automation, said Michelle Krebs, senior analyst for researcher Autotrader. “I’m not seeing all the pieces of the puzzle in place because they don’t have a relationship with a ride hailing service like Uber or Lyft,” Krebs said. “It’s a first step and at least Wall Street will see that they’re working on this.” Lidar Investment Ford and China’s top search engine company, Baidu Inc., are each investing $75 million in Velodyne Lidar Inc., the automaker said today in a statement. Lidar bounces light off objects to assess shape and location, giving self-driving cars a 360-degree view of their environment with the help of cameras and traditional radar. Morgan Hill, California-based Velodyne said the money will help it improve design and expand production, making the sensors more affordable for mass adoption. Ford wants “to do as much as they can internally, but also acknowledge that it’s best to partner with those who have the leading technology,” Jeff Schuster, an analyst at research firm LMC Automotive. Ford also said it acquired SAIPS, an Israel-based computer vision and machine learning company, to boost its capabilities in artificial intelligence. The automaker also struck an exclusive licensing agreement with New York-based Nirenberg Neuroscience LLC, founded by neuroscientist Sheila Nirenberg. Ford said she has developed a machine vision platform that it hopes can bring “humanlike intelligence” to autonomous cars. Ford didn’t disclose financial details of either deal. Ford also reiterated last month’s announcement that it was among five investors providing $6.6 million in seed funding for Civil Maps, a California startup that creates three-dimensional maps for driverless cars. GM Acquisitions GM has spent almost $600 million – and will spend more – acquiring self-driving software maker Cruise Automation and invested $500 million for a 9 percent stake in ride-hailing company Lyft Inc. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV has teamed with Google to develop 100 self-driving minivans. Ford conducted unsuccessful negotiations with Google prior to the Chrysler deal. Since GM announced its acquisition of Cruise Automation in March, the staff at the company has grown to 100 from 40, said Kevin Kelly, a GM spokesman. GM is testing Cruise’s self-driving software on Chevy Bolt electric cars in Scottsdale, Arizona. GM also has a research lab in Palo Alto that employs about 12 people, Kelly said. “Our goal is to use our autonomous technology in an on-demand ride-sharing network,” Kelly said. “Cruise paired perfectly with Lyft.” Velodyne said it “expects an exponential increase in lidar sensor deployments” and that it will continue to work with top automotive and ride-sharing companies worldwide. “We want the cost to be low enough to be used for all cars,” Marta Hall, Velodyne’s president of business development, said in the statement.

ERIC RISBERG, AP In this file photo a man leaves the headquarters of Uber in San Francisco. ERIC RISBERG, AP By JUSTIN PRITCHARD and TOM KRISHER / THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF SAN FRANCISCO – Uber passengers in Pittsburgh will be able to summon rides in self-driving cars with the touch of a smartphone button in the next several weeks. The high-tech ride-hailing company said Thursday that an unspecified number of autonomous Ford Fusions with human backup drivers will pick up passengers just like normal Uber vehicles. Riders will be able to opt in if they want a self-driving car, and rides will be free to those willing to do it, spokesman Matt Kallman said. Uber, which has a self-driving research lab in Pittsburgh, has no immediate plans to deploy self-driving cars beyond the Pittsburgh experiment. But its CEO, Travis Kalanick, has said the ride-sharing company’s future — indeed, the future of all transportation — is driverless. “When there’s no other dude in the car, the cost of taking an Uber anywhere becomes cheaper than owning a vehicle. So the magic there is, you basically bring the cost below the cost of ownership for everybody, and then car ownership goes away,” Kalanick said at the Code Conference in 2014, shortly after Google unveiled its self-driving car prototype. The announcement was one of three made by Uber that accelerate the company’s quest to provide autonomous taxis to the public worldwide. It’s also the latest tie-up between Silicon Valley, ride-hailing firms and major automakers. The San Francisco company announced a $300 million deal for Volvo to provide SUVs to Uber for autonomous vehicle research. Eventually the Volvo SUVs will be part of the self-driving fleet in Pittsburgh. Volvo will develop base vehicles for research and both companies will develop autonomous vehicles on their own. Uber also announced that it is acquiring a self-driving startup called Otto that has developed technology allowing big rigs to drive themselves. With the acquisition of Otto, Uber gets a fast infusion of self-driving expertise, including Otto co-founder Anthony Levandowski, one of the founding fathers of autonomous technology. Self-driving cars are not yet ready for the masses. Hurdles include software that is not yet good enough for public rollout, safety concerns raised by state and federal regulators, and uncertainty over society’s readiness to trust robot drivers. But the race is on. Large tech and auto companies suggest they could start selling self-driving cars within three to five years. If history is any guide, that push will begin with high-end models that few people can afford. Uber’s vast on-demand auto fleet could presumably bring the technology to ordinary people more quickly. Uber, however, isn’t alone in the race for autonomous vehicles. It’s not even a leader. The company’s primary U.S. competitor, Lyft, received a $500 million investment from GM earlier this year. Those two companies said they plan to put self-driving vehicles into Lyft’s fleet on a small scale sometime in the next year. GM also bought itself some self-driving expertise in March with the acquisition of a company called Cruise Automation. This week, Ford Motor Co. announced — in Silicon Valley, not Detroit — that it intends to have a self-driving vehicle on the road by 2021. The car will have neither a steering wheel nor pedals and will be rolled out for commercial ride-hailing services, not directly to consumers. Google’s parent company Alphabet Inc. is even further ahead in pursuing driverless cars that offer passengers little control beyond an emergency stop button. Google began testing its fleet of prototype self-driving cars on public roads in 2009. Though the Google car project just lost its director, Chris Urmson, it has a big head start. Its leaders have suggested they could launch public pilot tests of cars with no steering wheels or pedals in the next year or two. Putting robotic vehicles on the road has been an obsession for Levandowski. One earlier effort, a self-driving motorcycle named Ghostrider, is now in the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History. Until the start of this year, Levandowski was at Google, but he left to found Otto with two other former Google employees. After outgrowing the leafy Palo Alto neighborhood where they worked on their first rigs, Levandowski moved his headquarters to San Francisco and came out of stealth mode by posting a video of a truck driving itself down a Nevada highway. An actor sitting at a table in the cab jots notes on a pad of paper. Levandowski’s business proposition was straightforward. Big rigs spend most of their time on highways, making them a relatively easy problem to solve. Unlike bustling city streets, highways have well marked lanes, little or no cross traffic, and other features that make them far easier for a self-driving vehicle to navigate.

These 19 companies are racing to put driverless cars on the road by 2020 Danielle Muoio Aug. 18, 2016, 9:56 AM 93,991 facebook linkedin twitter email print When 2020 hits, you can bet it will start the decade of driverless cars. Volvo We rounded up 19 companies aiming to have driverless car technology ready by 2020, some even declaring their fully autonomous car will be hitting the roads at that time. (Assuming the various necessary regulations are in place, of course.) Here's who is in the race to make driverless cars a reality just four years from now. View As: One Page Slides Tesla is aiming to have its driverless technology ready by 2018. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Tesla CEO Elon Musk committed to the 2018 timeline last September, but it's unlikely we'll see one on the road. Musk himself said that it's unlikely regulators will be ready for driverless cars to hit the roads in 2018, so we'll have to wait to see how that plays out. Uber's autonomous car is hitting the streets in Pittsburgh. Uber Uber and Volvo have agreed to a $300 million alliance to develop driverless cars. The cars will be hitting the streets of Pittsburgh in August, where those hailing an Uber may get a chance to ride in one with human supervision in the driver seat. Uber has made a play for the self-driving car space by poaching staff from Carnegie Mellon University's robotics department. Google has never given a formal deadline, but has suggested it's working on having the technology ready by 2020. AP Chris Urmson, former head of Google's self-driving car project, suggested that he and his team are working on a 2020 deadline in a March 2015 TED Talk. Google is taking a different approach from other automakers in that it isn't looking to roll out semi-autonomous features overtime, but have a fully autonomous car ready. The cars have driven over 1.8 million miles in autonomous mode as of July. What's holding Google back? Aside from the need for further technological refinement, Google has called for federal laws that will set regulations for driverless cars and allow them to hit the roads. Toyota is looking to have a driverless car ready to go by 2020. The automaker is serious about having its driverless cars ready by 2020. In November,Toyota invested $1 billion in artificial intelligence and robotics to help make that goal a reality. The automaker is also mapping routes to aid its driverless car efforts. BMW will introduce its self-driving cars in China in 2021. BMW The German automaker is planning to release self-driving vehicles in China in 2021. BMW is also committed to releasing an all-electric car with the autonomous capabilities in late 2021 as part of its Project i20. By 2025, the Project i20 will be fully autonomous. BMW showed off some of its self-driving tech in its all-electric i3 concept, which can park itself and come back to pick you up when you're ready. The BMW 7 series also already comes with driverless features like lane keeping assist and side collision protection. Volvo is aiming to make its cars "deathproof" by 2020 by rolling out semi-autonomous features in its cars, eventually working up to fully driverless ones. Volvo In addition to the Uber deal in Pittsburgh, Volvo also plans to roll out an "advanced autonomous driving experiment" in China, where 100 volunteers will be able to test driverless Volvo XC90s on public roads. The experiment is part of its DriveMe program that will also test 100 driverless Volvos in Gothenburg, Sweden and London in 2017. By 2020, Volvo plans to be well on its way to having a fully autonomous car. Nissan is committed to have a commercially viable autonomous car on the roads by 2020. Nissan Nissan wrote on their website that it has "achieved the technological advancements necessary to begin to make this fiction a reality" by that date. The automaker is releasing ProPILOT, a self-driving feature that lets cars drive autonomously on highways, in August in Japan. But the system will eventually roll out in Europe, China, and the US. Nissan will continue to add driverless capabilities to ProPILOT until it has a fully self-driving car in 2020. Ford is aiming to have its fully autonomous car ready in four to five years. Ford Ford will roll out a fleet of self-driving cars as part of a ride-sharing or -hailing service by 2021. Like Google's autonomous cars, Ford's cars won't come with a steering wheel, brake or gas pedal. "What we have said is, we may not be the first, but when we do, it will be true to our brand, which means accessibility," Ford CEO Mark Fields recently told Business Insider in March. "We want to make sure it's available to everyone, and not just folks who can afford luxury cars." Ford and Chinese company Baidu recently invested $150 million in Velodyne, a manufacturer of a LiDAR system that allows self-driving cars to "see" the world around them. Ford showed its driverless cars can successfully navigate in complete darkness in April. The cars can also drive successfully in snow.  General Motors has partnered with Lyft to build electric, fully driverless cars that will be available to just about anyone. Cruise Automation GM announced its $500 million investment in Lyft at the Consumer Electronics Show in January to build a network of on-demand, driverless cars. GM hasn't said when the ride-sharing service will be available, but told Business Insider that it's "coming much faster than people anticipate." Ford also bought self-driving car startup Cruise Automation in March for $1 billion to bolster its autonomous car efforts.  Daimler, the maker of the Mercedes-Benz, is aiming to have its driverless trucks ready by 2020. Daimler In October, A Mercedes-Benz big-rig made history by driving itself on a public road, marking the first time a big-rig drove semi-autonomously on a highway. Daimler executives have said the system powering the autonomous truck, dubbed Highway Pilot, may be ready for real-world application by 2020.   The Audi A7 drove 550 miles by itself in 2015, but there's no word about when it's hitting the market. Audi Although a date hasn't been set yet, Audi is not a company to sleep on. The automaker was the first company to receive an autonomous driving permit in Nevada in 2012 and California in 2014.  Baidu, a Beijing-based search company, is aiming to have a commercial model of its driverless car ready by 2018. Baidu Baidu will test its self-driving cars in the US and currently has employees working on the project in its office in Sunnyvale, California. The company has made strides in developing the technology, in December Baidu's modified BMW 3-Series was able to drive an 18.6-mile route. The modified BMW successfully performed tasks like u-turns, changing lanes, passing other cars, and merging on and off highways. Honda is aiming to have fully autonomous cars on the road in 2020. Reuters/Noah Berger Honda has been testing its autonomous cars at the Concord Naval Weapons Station in San Francisco since March 2015. The automaker is developing forward-collision warning, lane- departure warning, and lane-keeping assist that it will roll out in its Acura and Civic cars this year, Reuters reported. Rolling out semi-autonomous features in its cars is part of Honda's plan to release a self-driving car by 2020. Hyundai is aiming to have driverless features in its cars by 2020, but won't have a fully autonomous car ready until 2030. Reuters/Steve Marcus Hyundai is aiming to have autonomous features ready by 2020, but its premium vehicles like the Genesis already have driverless features like automatic braking, Reuters reported. The automaker is aiming to have a fully self-driving car ready by 2030, Kwon Moon-sik, Hyundai Motor Group vice chairman, said at an event in Nov. 2015. It's rumored that Apple is working on a driverless car, but the company has yet to confirm. ConceptsiPhone via YouTube Apple is reportedly prioritizing working on the software for a driverless car, rather than building one from scratch, as is indicated by its hiring of Dan Dodge, the founder of QNX and one of the premiere experts in car software. It's known that Apple has hired driverless car experts, and Apple also approached a company called GoMentum, which specializes in testing self-driving cars on a former military base it owns. Rumor has it Apple aims to release its car in 2021. There are reports of the Apple car being developed in a secret lab in Berlin, Germany. But Apple could also be building the car in Vienna, Austria and a factory in Cork, Ireland. We also know Apple has met with officials from California's Department of Motor Vehicles to discuss state regulations for autonomous cars. Auto supplier Bosch has been working on driverless technology for several years with the ultimate goal of having an autonomous car ready in 2020. Bosch Bosch has been testing its driverless technology on public freeways in Germany, the US, and Japan since 2013. Above is a photo of the interior of one of its concept cars shown off at the Consumer Electronics Show in January. PSA Groupe, the second largest car manufacturer in Europe, is aiming to have fully driverless cars ready by 2020. YouTube/ PSA Peugeot Citroën Four of the automaker's self-driving cars traveled the 360 miles between Paris and Bordeaux, France in October. There was no driver involved for the entirety of the trip, and the cars were able to change lanes and adjust their speeds successfully. Start-up Faraday Future is working on an electric car and is developing autonomous technology for it. Rob Ludacer Faraday Future unveiled its concept car, pictured above, at the Consumer Electronics Show in January and described it as completely autonomous. The start-up told Business Insider that it will have prototypes that represent its production cars by the end of 2016. Its cars are slated to go into production by 2020. LeEco, a Chinese tech company, is also working on an autonomous, electric car. Facebook/LeEco LeEco is working on a car dubbed the LeSEE, pictured above, that's fully autonomous. The steering wheel can fold into the dashboard for when it's driving autonomously. It's also meant to be a fleet vehicle that you can summon to drive you somewhere in advance. There's no word yet on when we'll see the LeSEE. It's worth noting that LeEco is a partner of Faraday Future.

We said ‘Commit, commit, commit,’ and boy did we do that. And then it was just a run for it. I was pretty confident it was going to be first and second. Obviously I just had the edge on Jonny there. He’s had the edge in training to be honest. I think the only thing that is in my favour is maybe that I have a little bit more of an endurance engine. The run wasn’t a really quick run like in London, but we finished it off. I was just delighted, I got that gap after 6k, and I was thinking this is good, and I just got to the blue carpet.

A group of around ten riders are away at the front working incredibly hard in searing heat. It includes Australia’s Aaron Royle, Andrea Salvisberg of Switzerland, Slovakia’s Richard Varga, and the Brownlees.

They targeted the cycle when the route was announced as their moment to crank up the pressure on their rivals, and will look to work together now until the run.

Alistair Brownlee reaches the swim-finish fourth with Jonny only a few seconds off.

At the first turn the pack squeeze around the corner and a couple of swimmers have been trapped behind the huge buoy marking out the course. That’s not much fun. They have come back together however and are largely as one group at this stage with no notable breaks.

Here’s more from Barney Ronay in Rio: Further to Sean’s update on the Triathlon, I can confirm from my beachside seat that it is inhumanly hot on Copacabana. Just typing these words is bringing small beads of sweat from my fingertips and thereby threatening to destroy completely my pathetically vulnerable laptop (laptop available from all Apple stores). I just watched the Brownlees warming up, ie running into the sea and then out again. They look pretty happy, although I can also reveal this is the first time either has been in this bit of sea, having trained elsewhere for fear of infection. Gordon Benson the other GB competitor here is also milling about the sand having a good look at the course. Up close he is, as they say, a genuine “unit”, looks fit as a butcher’s dog. Astonishingly beautiful conditions for this event. Rio really is the perfect place to run, swim and cycle about, three things the locals do all the time up and down this strip.

While strolling through the sand I saw the Brownlee brothers Alistair and Jonny jogging along, looking as relaxed as anything. Their aim today is to finish 1-2 on the podium. Such an achievement would make them only the ninth pair of brothers in summer and winter Olympic Games history to finish with a gold and silver medal in the same event. And Alistair believes it is possible. “I’m feeling really good,” he says. “During the last few weeks, we’ve both put in some hard sessions, and I don’t think it could have gone an awful lot better, so we’re very happy. I will stand on that start line knowing I am not far off my very best.” The bookies have Alistair as a short-priced 8-11 favourite, which is probably about right. The big unknown is whether two lads from Yorkshire can handle the conditions, which are a lot hotter and more muggy than forecast.

The triathlon is one of the most physically draining events at the Games and will provide one of the most intriguing rivalries, that of Great Britain’s Brownlee brothers. Alistair is aiming to retain the crown he won in London but will have to fend off his younger brother Jonny who took bronze four years ago, as well as major medal prospects from Spain and France. What you need to know For those new to triathlon, it is a relatively straightforward but utterly gruelling event made up of a 1.5km swim, a 40km cycle, and finishing with a leisurely 10km run. In Rio the athletes will swim out into the Atlantic, completing one circuit of the marked course before returning to ditch the goggles for a road bike. The cycle takes in eight laps of a much tougher course than London which cuts inland from the coast and drags uphill before swinging back down to Copacabana Beach. The run is a little more forgiving: four relatively flat circuits along the coastline with legs burning to the end. The fastest men typically take around 1hr 45min to complete the race, depending on the course and conditions; transitions between each discipline are included in the overall time. There are 56 athletes listed for a busy start which means the swimming could get pretty dicey, and penalties are commonplace. Drafting (slipstreaming) is allowed in the cycling part of the race.

He won the title in Rio from Spain’s Javier Gómez after his brother Jonny suffered a penalty and had to settle for bronze. Gómez broke his elbow in a cycling accident last month ruling himself out of the Games. That news has strengthened the Brownlees’ hopes of a one-two finish, although don’t expect to see them holding hands as they cross the line, as Sean Ingle explains: Brownlees not so brotherly in run-up to Rio triathlon Read more Ones to watch Despite Gómez’s mishap, Alistair and Jonny have plenty of competition for the medals beyond each other. The pick of the bunch might be Spain’s Mario Mola, twice a world series silver medallist, and his compatriot Fernando Alarza could prove a useful foil in the cycle. France’s Vincent Luis won bronze in the 2015 world series and is likely to mount a serious challenge, and Richard Murray of South Africa will also be targeting a medal. There are plenty of athletes who could figure at the finish in an event which has its unpredictable elements, but winning gold will require solving a puzzle no one could in London four years ago: how to beat the Brownlees.

Last year, Google had announced its plans to deprecate web hosting in Google Drive for both users and developers. The announcement will affect Google Drive users who have published content using Google Drive as the hosting platform. Google had made provisions to use Drive account as a web hosting service back in 2013 and the service will shutdown on August 31, 2016. “In the time since web hosting in Drive was launched, a wide variety of public web content hosting services have emerged, and we think better options are available to people today. As a result, we have decided to discontinue this feature and focus on the core Drive and Google Apps experience,” read a blog post from the search giant. For those still hosting their website or content platform on Google Drive, the search giant recommends switching to Blogger or Firebase Hosting as an option. Google Drive users can alternately also refer to Google Domains for options. On August 21, 2016, the content or webpages hosted via Google Drive’s now deprecated web hosting option will not be accessible anymore.

Stars of the Rio 2016 Olympics are inspiring parents to name their babies after them Google searches for the names of gold medal winners have spiked since the start of Rio earlier this month By HAYLEY RICHARDSON 18th August 2016, 3:03 pm Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Comments THE Rio Olympic Games are undoubtedly inspiring nations – in more ways than just getting into sport. It seems soon-to-be parents are considering naming their children after some of this year’s champions. Rex Features 2 Searches for the baby name Simone have soared since the gymnast arrived in Rio Google searches for “Simone baby name” have spiked 230 percent in August since Team USA athletes swimmer Simone Manuel and gymnast Simone Biles headed to Rio, according to Google Trends. Biles, 19, and Manuel, 20, both captivated audiences as they secured positions on the Olympic podium. Manuel tied in the 100-meter freestyle race, becoming the first African-American female to win gold in an individual swimming event on Thursday. Simone x2 🏅💛 @simone_manuel pic.twitter.com/4ktpvKECV7 — Simone Biles (@Simone_Biles) August 12, 2016 And Biles proved she is the best female gymnast in the world on the same day when she took gold in the individual all-around competition. Biles notched up a tally of four golds and a bronze, while Manuel took home two golds and two silvers. One Twitter user quipped: “If you’re having a baby tonight, name her Simone.” If you’re having a baby tonight, name her Simone. — Margaret Lyons (@margeincharge) August 12, 2016 Related Stories trott sister's pain Tragic loss of two friends that forced Emma Trott to quit cycling revealed 'We're like brothers' Mark Cavendish slams claims of bitter feud between him and Bradley Wiggins cost of success Brits get zero while Singaporeans net over half a million: What Olympians are paid for taking gold 'She is my girl' Olympic gymnast Simone Biles's 'boyfriend' has kicked off about that kiss with Zac Efron beam & gone Simone Biles' dream of five golds ends with stumble on beam but US superstar still wins bronze A similar trend also shows a surge in searches for “baby name Michael” at the start of this month – presumably since US swimmer Michael Phelps made his mark in the pool. So, could the UK be facing a new generation of Mos, Jasons, Lauras and Andys? Google Trends show searches for “baby name Mo” and “baby name Jack” have rocketed since 10,000km champion Mo Farah and diver Jack Laugher arrived in Rio. PA 2 Searches for the baby name Mo are also on the rise since Mo Farah’s Rio success It wouldn’t be surprising to see a surge in the name Andy, after Andy Murray’s winning streak at Wimbledon and the Olympics. In the rest of the world, Ashton is another baby boy name trend – after reigning American Olympic decathlon champion Ashton Eaton who is hoping to defend his London 2012 gold medal.

Nevertheless, Google pressed forward and made good on its plans last month with the release of Chrome 52 to the stable channel. The chatter never died down, however, which forced the search giant to reevaluate its decision. Should the company backtrack, reintroduce the functionality and tick off the rest of the user base or leave things how they were? Fortunately, a third option emerged that should hopefully satisfy all parties involved. Google recently released an extension for Chrome called Go Back With Backspace that restores the backspace key as a back navigation button… that is, unless you’re typing text. The description notes that it doesn’t restore the functionality on special pages like in the settings or extensions sections but should otherwise do the trick. Google’s decision to remove the functionality in the first place stemmed from users that accidentally pressed the backspace key while working on a project or typing data into a form, thus losing their progress. Essentially, by removing it, Google was trying to protect users from themselves.

The company has revealed plans to start trialing a self-driving rideshare service as soon as this month. The tests will go down in downtown Pittsburgh, where users can request a ride from a self-driving vehicle alongside the normal options. The rides will be free, and they’ll always be accompanied by a human supervisor to ensure nothing goes wrong. As previously reported, Uber is putting to task Volvo’s XC90 vehicles for their efforts. This news comes hot on the heels of an important acquisition made by the company. Uber has bought up Otto, a name which likely isn’t familiar to you, but when you hear who is behind this company — which is apparently worth up to $680 million — you’ll see why they did it. Otto is a company which specializes in self-driving freight trucks. That may not sound like the sort of avenue Uber wants to get itself into, but we have a feeling the deal was more about the fact that 2 of Google’s former employees are heading the act. One of those guys is actually the former head of the company that Google bought to get their self-driving car project off the ground. Anthony Levandowski, as he’s named, formed 510 Systems on the back of his work on a system for autonomous self-stabilizing motorcycles. Those efforts would go on to be the basis of Google’s self-driving car project after Google acquired them. Fast forward to today, and both Levandowski and former Google Maps chief Lior Ron formed the company that Uber is buying today. The acquisition obviously puts Uber in a great spot to ensure they can prop their self-driving car efforts up without the help of anyone else, and perhaps this is their first bit of motion into other fields that they think warrant exploration. In any case, these inroads give Uber the potential to be the most significant player in the race to launching self-driving cars, and we can’t wait to see what happens from here on out.

People around the world will soon be able to see more of Saskatoon's attractions. For the next two weeks, three people with Tourism Saskatoon are walking around the city's many trails with a Google Trekker: a massive backpack camera which takes photographs every two to three seconds to create a 3D image. The group had an offer last spring from Google to take part in the project to get views of places that can't be photographed from a vehicle. “(Google) used the Trekker to tour the Grand Canyon, pyramids in Egypt, and now Saskatoon – the best of all,” said Chad Reynolds, media specialist for Tourism Saskatoon. Reynolds is one of the employees carrying the 45-pound device on his back. The group will check out a number of attractions including the Meewasin Trail, Forestry Farm Park and Zoo and even a kayaker's view from the South Saskatchewan River. “I walked the lesser-known Meewasin Trails and they're beautiful,” Reynolds said. “It will be great for people who live in Saskatoon to be able to see the attractions on Google maps from a new perspective.” The battery on the camera backpack lasts around five hours before it has to be recharged. The images are expected to be on Google Maps in the next six months.

Lifestyle Tech News Uber launches self-driving taxis, with people unknowingly getting picked up by autonomous vehicles The cars will arrive as normal – but they won’t have a driver, and they’ll also be free Andrew Griffin @_andrew_griffin Thursday 18 August 2016 13:20 BST Click to follow The Independent Tech The Volvo XC90s that will be driving themselves around Pittsburgh in the next few weeks Uber Uber customers will soon get picked up by autonomous cars instead of those being driven by humans. The company is rolling out a scheme in Pittsburgh that will see people call Ubers as normal – only to have a specially-designed, self-driving Volvo come to pick them up. There will initially be someone sat in the front seat of the car, making sure that it is safe as well as allowing it to satisfy regulations that at the moment prohibit cars driving themselves around. And it will initially be tested in a specific area – though it’s widely-expected to roll out elsewhere in the future.

Those customers will call their Uber as normal. When it arrives, they’ll get in and find that their journey is free, as part of their recompense for testing out the new robot taxis. Previously, it was thought that Uber might work to build its own cars, similar to what Google – and supposedly Apple – is doing. But the cars are custom versions of the Volvo XC90, fitted out with technology to let them drive themselves and a person helping it out in the front seat.  As well as acting as a safety measure, the engineer that will be staffing the car will also be able to observe and take notes about how the cars are used. And the cars will have a computer in it, taking measurements and recording data as the cars move along.

If you want to increase your search traffic, posting high quality content should be one of your main focus. Whether we speak about Google or Bing, search results are determined by three things: topical relevance, content quality, and context. How Guest Posts May Derail Your Google Ranking How Guest Posts May Derail Your Google Ranking If you own a blog or website that depend on content and Google's Panda, then you know the…Read more Webmasters understand how crucial it is to have quality content on a website to generate more traffic and achieve better conversions. In this article, I’ll show you 5 easy ways to optimize your content, that can help you improve your search engine rankings. 1. Leverage Authority, Utility and Presentation When preparing content for publication, it is crucial to understand the three pillars of content quality, namely: Authority, Utility and Presentation. Pin it IMAGE: Bing Blogs Let’s look at them, one by one. Authority Trust is the currency of the web, and to have good rankings, you need to gain the trust of search engines first. If they start to trust your website, it will rank it higher. Authority means whether users can trust your content or not. There are many things you can do to increase the authority of your content. Always provide accurate and newsworthy information, and cite the sources. Add original research, reviews and testimonials to your content. Each piece of your copy needs to have clear information about its author, and it’s the best if every author provides their social media profiles and is a subject-matter expert. Get as many social shares as you can. The more you have, the better your audience and the search engines will trust in your site. Use secure HTTPS protocol, as it also adds a minor ranking boost. If your site contains medical information, it should be written by a certified doctor or a health care professionals. Below you can see an example for a page with low quality content. It’s full of ads, written by an unidentified author, and has confusing navigational elements: Pin it Utility Search engine algorithms try to predict whether your content is really about the topic it addresses. They want to know whether the overall content provides sufficient supporting information to the given subject. To increase the utility of your content, prepare it for no one else but your target audience. For instance, if your target audience consists of kids then the language should be simple, and accompanied by images and videos for easier understanding. It’s also crucial to provide unique content instead of recycling articles or web copy from other sources. Users want all the information at one place, so supply everything they may be interested in on the same page, and keep it simple and understandable. Content must be well-edited and detailed as well. Try to provide supporting multimedia and links to closely related articles if it’s possible. Presentation Your website content needs to be well designed and visually attractive as well. Good presentation will better explain and educate your audience about your products and services. Websites with appropriate information and elegant layouts are usually preferred. To improve your content presentation, you need to reduce distractions on your site. Get rid of popup ads, in-text ads, top-of-the-content ads, etc. The goal is to make it easier for users to find the primary content. Also make sure you don’t have any content hidden behind ads. Navigational elements also must be user-friendly and logical. Always double-check whether your content is easy to scan. Using proper subheadings and relevant images can help you improve scannability. 2. Add Fresh Content Regularly Google measures all documents for freshness, keeping your website updated and regularly publishing new content results in better search rankings. QDF stands for Query Deserves Freshness, and it’s a component of Google’s ranking algorithm. QDF queries are related to hot topics that suddenly surge in Google Trends. Use Google Trends to identify these topics, and write about them. This may help you quickly rank for these QDF queries. To keep your content fresh, focus on actual topics, such as a recent political controversy or a popular sports event. Publish new content often, as this way you can rank for new keywords, but also keep updating your older content to prevent it from becoming stale. Add a relevant timestamp whenever you update your content, e.g. "this page was last updated on mm-dd-yyyy". Apart from publishing fresh content, also have content focusing on regularly recurring events, such as the Dancing with the Stars TV series or the NFL scores. It can also be a good idea to look up topics trending on social media and write about them. 3. Prepare Panda-Friendly Content Google Panda was first released in February 2011. It was a major algorithm update that affected around 12% of search results. It targeted low-quality websites that had spun or duplicate content, and large content farms that generated similar content on long-tail keywords adding little to no value to users. There were several updates in the Panda algorithm until January 2016 when it was integrated with Google’s main ranking algorithm. Google Panda: 5 Tips You Should Know Google Panda: 5 Tips You Should Know It's here. It's inevitable. It's called Google Panda, the latest Google's search algorithm which aims to promote the…Read more You can improve your search rankings by impressing Google Panda. To do so: Get rid of boilerplate content and don’t overuse keywords. Always make sure you have a clear site hierarchy and valid and semantic HTML. (Higher bounce rates shows to Google that your site is not user-friendly, so consider how you can reduce it.) Don’t use deceiving tactics, such as cloaking and doorway pages. Ensure your site doesn’t have any broken links and faulty redirects. Have proper canonical tags in order to get rid of potential duplicates. Try to increase the quality of your backlinks as people tend to link back to quality content, and search engines use this factor in their algorithms. Avoid using scraped or automatically generated content as well. Your content should educate your readers by leading them from a problem to a solution. Also create FAQ pages that provide relevant answers to exact questions. 4. Use Schema.org Markup Schema.org is an extensibe vocabulary that makes it possible to describe structured data on the web. Structured data makes it easier for search engines to understand your content. Adding Schema.org markup to your site will allow your content to be displayed among Google’s rich results that can lead to higher click-through rates, and better search engine rankings. Recommended Reading: Improve Your Search Results with Rich Snippets & Schema.org Vocabulary If you want to improve your rankings, introduce schema.org markup on your website, if you haven’t done it yet. The simplest way is to use Google’s Structured Data Markup Helper. Log in, and select the type of data you want to mark up, then paste the belonging URL, and click the Start Tagging button. The structued data markup tool will be loaded, and you’ll be provided with a workspace to tag the data items (author, publication date, URL, etc.) on your web page. Pin it Tagging in Google’s Structured Data Markup Helper Once you’ve finished, click the Create HTML button. On the following screen, you will see the HTML of your page with the relevant structured data. Use Google’s Structured Data Testing Tool to find out how your page will look like. 5. Be Displayed In Rich Answers Rich answers are Google’s attempt to answer user queries right on the search page. In rich answers, Google displays direct answers from relevant and trusted websites. Having your content in the rich answer box is a great way to increase organic search traffic to your site. Here’s how a simple rich answer looks like: Pin it simple Rich Answer To get your content indexed as a rich answer, create a list of the most common questions people ask in your industry. Make sure you don’t use industry jargon as most people don’t use them in queries. When you’re done with your list, create content that specifically answers these questions. One question per page. Wherever you can, use a step-by-step answer format, such as this step-by-step instruction below about how to boil an egg: Pin it Step-by-Step Answer Format in Featured Rich Snippets Use keywords in your answers, and mark up the question with the <h1> HTML tag. Here’s a screenshot of the HTML code that creates the web page for the rich answer for the query why is the sky blue. Notice the <h1> tag in the code. Pin it Final Words Utilizing these methods can help you make your content stand out among the search results. Patience is the key here. Don’t attempt to change the content of all your web pages overnight. Instead, adopt a slower yet more effective approach to replace your existing content with more actionable, better structured, and fresher content to achieve better search rankings.

Oracle has found a new bone to pick, this time, it has to do with Android apps on the desktop. Google recently brought Android apps to Chromebooks and Oracle says they never mentioned their intent to do so. Here’s where things get interesting. Google says they did tell Oracle about the plans and even supplied information about how it works. You might be wondering why it’s such a big deal for Google to not tell Oracle about this. Bringing Google Play to Chrome OS shows that Google is trying to break into the market for Java SE on desktops. Oracle’s attorney claims this move will increase the amount of market harm that Oracle will experience Google says Android doesn’t compete with Java SE because it was built for smartphones. However, Google has claimed in the past that they haven’t harmed Java SE because Android isn’t on desktops. That’s no longer the case. Earlier this year, a jury found that Google’s use of Java APIs didn’t violate copyright laws, but now Oracle has said it will appeal the verdict.

The comparisons to Apple’s own FaceTime are obvious, with both offering high quality video and audio, however Duo’s big advantage is that it is cross-platform. Unfortunately, the one major feature that Duo doesn’t have yet is support for audio-only calls. But at least Google has confirmed that it’s on the way. Responding to questions on Google+, Amit Fulay, Google’s product lead for communication, noted that audio-only calls were coming to Duo, but didn’t offer any timeline other than the vague “soon.” It’s honestly a bit surprising that the option wasn’t included at launch, but there you go. Audio-only calls are pretty much an essential option for any video calling app, as they allow users to connect when a strong WiFi or data signal isn’t available, or if they’re trying to conserve data usage. In addition to FaceTime, apps like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger have long supported audio-only calls. As for Hangouts, Google’s other messaging and video calling app that’s been around for years, it seems the company will be gearing it towards business users while separating its two functions into Duo and the forthcoming Allo for texting.

Now it looks like the app will soon allow audio-only calls. Google’s product lead for communication Amit Fulay has confirmed that audio-only calls will come to Duo “soon.” Fulay commented on a Google Plus thread that the feature is “coming soon” while replying to someone posted question. Duo reduces the resolution to keep the call going smoothly in case of limited bandwidth. It even switches between Wi-Fi and cellular data automatically without dropping your call. Moreover, the app intelligently turns a video call into an audio-only call when the connection is poor. Google Duo already supports HD (720p) video calling and is optimized to work on low bandwidth mobile networks. The app will be available in 78 languages when it is globally launched.

Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Instagram YouTube RSS Skip to content SEO News Content Marketing Social Media Paid Search Work Life Advertise How to Do Keyword Research: A Complete Guide SEO Roger MonttiAugust 18, 2016 VIP CONTRIBUTOR 2.3KSHARES 13.8KREADS 2.3KSHARES 13.8KREADS VIP CONTRIBUTORRoger Montti 2.3KSHARES 13.8KREADS Editor’s Note: This is a section of our completely redone SEO Guide. Enjoy! Search engines have been minimizing the importance of keyword relevance signals for ranking for many years. It is a fact that keywords are no longer necessary or mandatory to be present in the title tag or in heading tags (H1, H2, H3) in order to rank in the top five of the search engine results pages. Even using the exact keyword phrases within the text of a web page is no longer required. Should you abandon keyword research and focus more effort on content creation? Surprisingly, the answer is no. Keyword research is still important, but in a different way than has been practiced in the past. For example, the different meanings of a phrase and the popularity of each meaning is vitally important. The skillful use of words continues to be important, and this guide will show you how to research keywords in a manner that is appropriate for the way search engines work today. The goal of this guide is to show how keyword research continues to be useful, to shine a light on numerous misconceptions, and show you how a scientific understanding of how keywords are used by search engines today can help you rank for high traffic/high conversion keywords. The principles outlined in this guide apply equally to mobile content and is appropriate regardless of how textual content is delivered to the consumer. Define Your Goals: What Do You Want to Accomplish with Search Traffic? The biggest mistake search marketers make is to define success as more traffic. But more traffic should never be your goal. Increasing sales should always be the goal. Traffic is simply a means to solving the sales problem. Traffic is never the end goal. Increasing earnings should always be the focus. When developing a keyword strategy for an e-commerce website, the first step is to define the sales problem the business wishes to solve. These are your real goals. Examples of Typical E-Commerce Keyword Goals: Sales Feeding different segments of the sales funnel Ad clicks and ad impressions Building awareness of your site, services, and products That last one, building awareness, is of major importance because it will help you rank for major keyword phrases in addition to driving direct sales.  More on this strategy a little later. Keep reading! Once the keyword goals are defined you can then develop keyword categories to address those goals, and begin categorizing your keywords in order to build a content and marketing strategy. The first two categories are directly sales related; they solve a business problem directly. The second two categories (Feeding research levels of the sales funnel/building CPM traffic) can be seen as consumer-related because they generally revolve around solving a problem for consumers. Money Phrases The sales category focuses on what the SEO industry calls Money Phrases. Money phrases are keyword phrases that are associated with a high level of sales. Examples of money phrases are “cheap widgets” and “where to buy widgets.” Money phrases are important (and competitive!) because they almost always result in a sale. Money phrases are also important to ad-supported sites because the site visitor, being predisposed to making a purchase, is also more likely to click an ad unit and earn revenue for the web publisher. Advertising associated with money phrases usually have a higher cost per click resulting in higher advertising earnings. That’s why these keywords are called Money Phrases! Problem with Money Phrases Money phrases are highly competitive and difficult to rank for. That’s a given. A more important consideration that many are unaware of is that Pay Per Click ads will siphon off traffic that is (arguably)  more inclined to make a purchase, with the rest of the traffic distributed to the organic results. A sizable portion of the money keyword traffic is skimmed off through the Pay Per Click ads. I’m going to show you how to solve this problem. Stay with me because the solution I am going to share is not entirely well understood in the search marketing industry. Anatomy of Money Phrases Aside from the obvious phrases containing words like “buy” in them, there are an additional set of keyword phrases that indicate a user intent to make an immediate purchase. These are so-called longtail “money phrases” that are important to rank for. I have categorized longtail money phrases into five categories. Each category represents a multiplicity of keyword phrases and their variants (singular and product name variants). Top 5 Money Phrase Keyword Categories Competitor comparison Discount price searches Product reviews and ratings Coupon code searches Searches for sales I have developed many spreadsheets of valuable keyword phrases in a variety of industries. While I can’t publicly share them, I have shared the five categories I use so you can develop and categorize your own list of money phrases. Money Phrase Keywords and Site Architecture Now here’s the important thing to understand: There are good reasons to not use the list to build a site architecture that revolves around the money phrases. The reason is because that is the way to build a site tuned for keyword relevance. But if you read Google’s Quality Raters Guidelines you will see that Google (and presumably the algorithms) aren’t ranking web pages for their keyword relevance signals. They are ranking web pages for their expertise, authority, and trustworthiness. This is an important point that I will return to later. But for now, understand that many sites that the search engines are ranking today are not built with a site architecture that revolves exclusively around money phrases. The Value of Non-Money Phrase Keywords Money phrases are so-called because visitors using those phrases tend to convert and put money in the till. These are the most important keyword phrases for making immediate sales on a regular basis. If your company is not ranking for money phrases then someone else is. So it might as well be you that ranks for the money phrases, right?  Not always. There is another keyword path to building online sales. Often the barrier to entry for a competitive money phrase is too high because the established companies in the search results have a seemingly insurmountable lead in terms of backlinks, content, social media reach, and other factors that cannot be easily copied, at least not without years of work. There is another way to building traffic and that’s with non-money phrases. It may sound counter-intuitive that the way to attract buyers is with keywords that do not convert. But it’s a viable path toward eventually ranking for the money phrases. Here is how it works: The Advantage of Being Comprehensive Most money phrases are awarded to the most authoritative sites. Yes, quantity and quality backlinks plays a role. However, content is a highly important ingredient. And not just any content but comprehensive content. A site that is comprehensive is authoritative. Authoritative sites are the kind that search engines prefer to rank. Google’s Search Quality Raters Guideline states in section 3.1 “Page Quality Rating: Most Important Factors Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness: This is an important quality characteristic.” Later on in section 3.2 the guidelines states: “The amount of expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness… that a webpage/website has is very important.” An Alternate Money Phrase Ranking Strategy Although visitors to an authoritative site may not convert via the non-money search queries that the site ranks for, the authority strategy does have the effect of cultivating awareness, building goodwill, stimulating word of mouth referrals, links, and ultimately money-phrase ranking and sales. This is one of the secrets to ranking for money phrases. Instead of focusing exclusively on the money phrases focus on the authority building long-tail phrases. The old way of ranking for money phrases was with a full-frontal attack on those phrases. Over the years it’s become increasingly evident that comprehensive sites tend to rank for the best phrases. ADVERTISEMENT Focusing exclusively on keyword relevance has been showing diminishing returns for the past ten years. Focusing on depth of content, expertise, and authority is a solid path to ranking for money phrases. Keyword Strategies for Building Awareness and Ad Impressions In general, if you want to rank well for the high traffic, two-word phrases then you must be authoritative for the three, four, and five-word phrases. In general, a site that is authoritative for a high traffic money phrase is only authoritative because they are comprehensive on a granular level. Once the granular content is in place, the links attracted to the granular topics builds topical relevance for the entire site. Should You Worry about Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI)? Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) is a very old technology, developed nearly twenty years ago, whose purpose was to strengthen a search engine’s ability to identify the correct context of a word. Words often have more than one meaning (this is called Polysemy). Thus, a word or phrase appearing on a page did not guarantee that the page was relevant to a search phrase. LSI technology was used to overcome polysemy, to help a text-based search engine identify the context of a web page and thus better match a search query. Background Reading about Latent Semantic Indexing: http://www.cse.msu.edu/~cse960/Papers/LSI/LSI.pdf https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1301/1301.6705.pdf http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~pxt/IDA/plsa.pdf http://www.internetnews.com/IAR/article.php/2195901/Google+Scoops+Up+Applied+Semantics.htm History of LSI In 2003 Google acquired an important contextual analysis technology. The technology was known as Circa and it was acquired by Google when it purchased a company called Applied Semantics. In a nutshell, Circa was based on an understanding of language through the use of the Open Directory Project categories to create themes that a web page could be classified under. Thus, a web page could be understood as belonging to a particular thematic topic. Applied Semantics created the technology that powered Google’s AdSense program, enabling Google to better match website content to keywords associated with advertising. This a kind of contextual analysis that was used as a foundation for the AdSense program, which has since added additional technologies such as placement targeting, interest-based targeting and language targeting to improve and expand the AdSense program. In fact, according to Google, their contextual targeting uses the overall link structure of the entire web to determine what a web page is about, which is far more sophisticated and advanced than simple LSI. Seeing how LSI has a diminished role in the AdSense program it is likely that it does not play a significant role in search ranking as well. It is reasonable to surmise that LSI plays a small to insignificant role in search ranking because the science of information retrieval has come a long way since 2003. Should You Use Keyword Synonyms? Synonyms (and LSI) were initially used as a way to combat keyword spamming. Although Google was never a keyword based search engine, it was not entirely immune to keyword spamming, more formally known in scientific circles as Term Spamming. It’s called Term Spamming because this kind of spam focuses on search query terms, hence, search query Term Spamming. With the advent of the Hummingbird update and the increased ability for natural language processing (an attempt to understand language beyond keyword relevance), the search marketing industry responded by recommending the use of synonyms in order to rank better. The thinking goes that in order to be topically relevant for a phrase that you would have to salt your web page with synonyms. But this strategy is a “back of the napkin” solution to a highly complex problem. The advice to use synonyms in a web page is literally a joke: Did you hear the one about the SEO who walked into a bar, a speakeasy, a dive, a gin joint? Clearly, using synonyms is a simplistic approach to being topically relevant. It’s the tired old term spamming trick rooted solidly on ranking for keyword relevance, a strategy that no longer works. In my opinion, it’s not necessary if you are focused on expertise, authority, and trustworthiness. Even way back in 2005, in the research paper cited above, it is stated that the goal was to present the most relevant and most important web pages. Keywords are About User Intent Words and phrases have multiple user intent. The SERPs are ordered to satisfy the user intent of the most people. Thus if the user intent you choose to satisfy is less popular you will never rank at the top of Google’s search results. And that’s ok! There’s nothing you can do to change that situation when it happens. Not to get too technical but there is other research and patents that deal with using prior searches, location, and other factors to personalize the order of the sites that are shown in the results. However that likely isn’t the norm across a wide range of search queries. At the beginning of this chapter, I stated that the best use of words is important. Understanding the user intent of a keyword phrase is paramount because it will guide the purpose of a page. The search quality guidelines state that every page is judged according to how it satisfies a site visitors goals. The quality guidelines state that the best pages “fully satisfies the user intent” of the search query. There is a ratings category called Fully Meets. It is applied to situations where the user intent is unambiguous. This applies especially so for e-commerce phrases where the intent to buy is clear. Fully Meets is the gold standard for satisfying a user query and becoming the number one ranked page for an unambiguous query. In my opinion, it should be your goal for satisfying the user intent even of ambiguous queries, where you identify all the possible user intents then choose which user intent you are going to satisfy. How Google Defines a Site that “Fully Meets” a Users Needs The query and user need must be specific, clear, and unambiguous. The result must be fully satisfying for mobile users, requiring minimal effort for users to immediately get or use what they are looking for. All or almost all users would be completely satisfied by the result—users issuing that query would not need additional results to fully satisfy the user intent. In other words, the Fully Meets rating should be reserved for results that are the “complete and perfect response or answer” so that no other results are necessary for all or almost all users to be fully satisfied.” The top ranked sites rank in the top ten because their web pages satisfy the most popular user intent for that keyword phrase. Keyword Popularity Understanding the user intent of a phrase is important because it will guide your content creation strategy. In the case of an ambiguous user intent, where a keyword phrase has multiple meanings, it is important to make a list of all the different user intents. If you search on Google you may be able to discern the different user intents. The most popular variation is most likely to be the one that is highest ranked. Here’s an important insight: For many search queries, the top ranked sites are not ranked at the top because they have more links pointing to their pages. Nor are they top-ranked because they contain all of the keywords. The top ranked sites rank in the top ten because their web pages satisfy the most popular user intent for that keyword phrase. If there are three user intents for a search query, it is the most popular user intent that will be featured at the top- not the site with the most keyword anchor text. This literally gives the phrase Keyword Popularity a whole new meaning! If the user intent is split between more users who are researching for academic purposes and users who are researching to make a purchase, Google will rank web pages that are informational than transactional. No matter how many links you amass to your page, if the user intent of your page is unpopular then you will never crack the top five of any search engine. Ranking for keyword phrases is no longer about ranking the web pages with the most links and the most complete content. It’s about ranking the web pages that most fully satisfies the most popular user intent. The word paramount means that something is of extreme importance, more important than anything else. This why I used that word when I said that understanding the user intents of keyword phrases is paramount. This also relates to what was stated at the beginning of this guide, that keywords continue to be important, but in a different manner in which they have been used. Comparison of keyword trends Google Trends Tool Keywords are a window into what users want, the user intent. Google Trends is a good tool to identify changes in how keywords are being used. Google trends will help you see how phrases are trending up, trending down, trending in a cyclical pattern and identify regional patterns. Understanding cyclical and regional patterns will better help you know when to roll out certain kinds of content and also to understand to focus your link building in certain regions for certain phrases, since those phrases will be more popular in those regions. This is an important insight! In the example illustrated above it is abundantly clear that the phrase Uber is wildly popular compared even to the generic phrase taxi. The trend line also shows that the phrase taxi is trending downward, in recent times the search inventory plummeted to as low as it was in 2004. Comparing keywords with brand names is highly useful. For example, the keyword trends for digital cameras trends downwards with the introduction of the iPhone. This data can be used to confirm a hunch about a correlation in consumer spending habits. Another example is a comparison of the trends between the phrases radio station and the brand name, Spotify. The phrase radio station is trending downwards while the brand name Spotify is trending upward. There’s no correlation between the two trends but it does show a change in how people are consuming music. When you see a traffic decline even though your rankings are unchanged, it can sometimes mean there is a change in consumer behavior tied to the introduction of a new product or service. And here is an important insight into how to use the Google Trends tool: Compare keyword phrases with keywords whose actual search volumes you are familiar with- even if the known keyword phrase is unrelated. Consequently, it makes analyzing the search trends for an unfamiliar keyword phrase easier because you have a baseline for comparison. Three Important Takeaways Keyword strategies are not about synonyms A proper keyword strategy is predicated on creating a topical map of your niche in order to help you grow your site to become authoritative, expert, and trustworthy. Identify the user intent, then set about satisfying that intent Algorithms are tuned to satisfying user queries by answering questions. They are no longer matching search queries to keywords on a web page. This does not mean that you should phrase your pages as questions and answers. It means understanding the user intent and constructing your content so that it satisfies the user intent implicit in the keyword phrase.  Integrate user experience into your keyword strategy Web pages rank because websites link to those pages. Websites link to those pages because those pages solved a problem, because it scratches an itch. Nobody ever linked to a web page because of its keyword relevance. Only an SEO walks into a bar, a dive, a speakeasy. Nobody links to that. People link to a site because of positive user experiences. View your keyword list through the framework of user intent and then consider how the resulting content can be used to create a positive user experience. How can a web page use a keyword phrase in a way that results in better rankings? You now understand the answer. Go forth and make some money!   Image Credits:  Featured Image: rozelt/DepositPhotos.com In-post Photo: topvectors/DepositPhotos.com In-post Photo: polesovky/DepositPhotos.com In-post Photo: rozelt/DepositPhotos.com Images edited by Roger Montti Screenshot by Roger Montti.

Thank you for this comprehensive discussion on Semantic Search (and the links to LSI tech). You mentioned something about creating a topical map for our niche. Do you have a sample for that? Are you planning a post discussing that in detail? Thanks and more power! martinibuster Thanks for asking. That is something I need to write a follow up for. It’s related to building out a site architecture and it’s also related to taxonomy, which for the purposes of SEO means creating categories out of a topic. A good example of a taxonomy is the Open Directory Project at DMOZ. That’s an easy one to see. A more in depth and exhaustive taxonomy is Wikipedia. Breadth of coverage will help a site rank for the more generic phrases, if that’s part of your strategy. It’s great for an informational site or for branding purposes and does convert- but in terms of picking your battles, I’ve always favored depth, rather than going for the big phrases. The big phrases tend to follow after you conquer the smaller phrases. And that makes sense because in most cases only a comprehensive site is worthy of ranking for a comprehensive keyword phrase. Thus, when I say create a topical map, I mean the process of brainstorming all the topics that are necessary to be covered in order for the site to be considered comprehensive. Depth versus shallow- but it has to be relevant to your core money phrases. FRANC RAY Thanks for the post, it’s really educative martinibuster Your welcome. Be sure to follow me on Twitter @martinibuster because I have an explosive article coming soon that is of interest to the entire SEO industry. I can’t say what it is, but follow me to keep in touch. You will be rewarded. 😉 semalaia4n Your blog is very nice.The skillful use of words continues to be important.Thanks for the sharing. Nelson Dy Good day everyone! I got confused. In SEO your goal is to rank your client’s website, or you have the responsibility to make their sales grow? martinibuster There is no point to ranking a site if the ranking does not lead to increased sales. Thus, one of the biggest newbie mistakes is to optimize a site for traffic without understanding if that traffic will convert. There is also value in ranking for phrases that are “related” to sales, like research. Always focus on the user who is likely to purchase, who sometimes can have a different job function at a corporation, or be on a different skill level. Which means all four of those kinds of site visitors will be making different kinds of search queries to solve different kinds of problems. If you dip your toes in PPC awhile you’ll see that many of the higher traffic generic phrases don’t always convert as well as the more focused phrases. You can experiment with PPC to find out, sometimes you can “get an idea” of how valuable a phrase is by reviewing how competitive that phrase is in PPC (how many ads are showing when you type in that search phrase). Amber I felt like this article conflicted with almost everything else I’ve read about keyword analysis. martinibuster All of the points made in any of my articles are backed up by links to Google Patents, statements and other related citations. All the links are embedded in the article so that you can follow them and confirm if there is scientific validity to what is written. My ideas are informed from personal experience (about 16 years of SEO experience) and from studying scientific research papers published by university scientists, Bing and Google. If I speculate about something then I make sure to label it as “my opinion” in order to separate opinion from verifiable fact. 😉 Glad you enjoyed the article!

As Google describes the project, this is not a full-on antivirus engine, but a simple app that whitelists and blacklists macOS processes. Santa's GUI is nothing more than a glorified notification window that lets users know when the app has blocked a process from executing. The version Softpedia tested has no other GUI, except the popup you see pictured at the end of the article. Santa has two modes of operation, otherwise a very simplistic app At its core, this malware sniffer is nothing more than a userland daemon that scans new processes and blocks apps from executing based on a list of allowed/disallowed processes stored in a local SQLite database. The project's documentation on GitHub details two operational modes: MONITOR and LOCKDOWN. The MONITOR mode uses a blocklist to tell the OS what apps it's not allowed to run. The LOCKDOWN uses a whitelist of apps it's allowed to run, meaning any other app not on this list will be blocked by default. Users and network admins can add apps to Santa's blacklist based on signing certificates. "You can therefore trust/block all binaries by a given publisher that were signed with that cert across version updates," Google explains. "A binary can only be whitelisted by its certificate if its signature validates correctly, but a rule for a binaries fingerprint will override a decision for a certificate; i.e. you can whitelist a certificate while blacklisting a binary signed with that certificate, or vice-versa." Santa has built-in defenses to prevent tampering Just like any good security product, Santa keeps logs of all tasks it performs but also comes with its own security measures to make sure malware won't sabotage the product's own process in order to avoid detection. Malware can modify Santa's blocklist to block Santa or macOS core processes. Santa's components also validate each other using Apple's XPC service API and won't communicate if any of their signing certificates aren't identical. There's no fixed date for Santa's release. Everyone can install the product, but bear in mind that this is alpha-stage software.

Denton ISD’s fourth and fifth grades are getting classroom sets of laptops for the new school year. 1 of 3 Fourth- and fifth-graders start school year with new digital tools By Rhiannon Saegert Rhiannon Saegert Denton Record-Chronicle Staff Writer rsaegert@dentonrc.com Published: 18 August 2016 07:14 AM After testing the waters with a study last year, Denton ISD is integrating classroom sets of Chromebooks into fourth- and fifth-grade classrooms starting this fall. Students will use the simple, lightweight laptops to learn reading, writing and social studies through different educational applications and websites. Tenille Shade, a fourth-grade teacher at Pecan Creek Elementary, participated in the pilot study before the district bought the new sets of Chromebooks. “They use them for research a lot, they do projects on it,” Shade said of her students. “We did a lot of online reading and taught them how to go to specific sites. Fourth grade is kind of a big year for a technology curve. They come in, they learn to do email, and they learn all the Google apps for education stuff.” In most cases, students have the option to write assignments by hand if they’d prefer to, and the majority of written work is still done with pen and paper. Classrooms will spend a few lessons covering online etiquette, typing, how to carry and handle the Chromebooks, and how to use the various apps. “We’re not going to send kids to the playground unattended, and this is a digital playground,” Shade said. “It’s my job to empower them and teach them how to use it as a tool, not a toy. They’re going to make mistakes, but let’s let them learn when they’re 10 and it’s less costly and not when they’re 18. Let’s start early teaching kids how to be good digital citizens.” Shade said students who had trouble writing because of dexterity issues and students with special needs especially benefited from the Chromebooks. “Historically, we’re bound by paper and pencil, and one piece of paper is what tells me whether a child has hit their target or not. Now, I can say, ‘Maybe you’re struggling to write a summary, but can you tell me one?’” Fourth- and fifth-graders used Google Slides, Classroom, Docs, Drive and Hangouts and other educational apps last year. In fifth grade, students can make their own videos. Last year, Shade set up video chat sessions (through Skype and Google Hangouts) with authors and other professionals for lessons. She said one of her goals for this year is to encourage her students to contact professionals and set up their own interviews. “I think these kids could do that. I think they’re equipped and it would empower them and make them feel more engaged,” Shade said. “If I’m learning about this particular topic, why don’t I call a scientist? Why don’t I email an anthropologist?” There are 20 to 24 students in each classroom, and about 10 Chromebooks in each class set. She said some students will bring their own devices from home, which makes up the difference. “Bring Your Own Device’ has its own challenges and rewards, because they all came with different technology,” Shade said. “This kid has a Samsung tablet, this kid has an iPad, et cetera. You can figure it out, but having the continuity of the same device helps all learn and grow together.” Students won’t take the devices home, but Shade said the majority of the students have internet access at home and can use the same tools through Google Chrome, a free web browser and platform that integrates written files, email, photos and other apps. Rather than send kids home with graded papers, teachers can upload graded assignments to online portfolios for parents to see. Shade and other teachers also use ClassDojo, an app designed to keep parents and teachers in touch. At the beginning of the school year, teachers send out surveys to parents to help gauge how comfortable they are with technology. Shade said she and other teachers will hold technology classes for parents if necessary. “One of the challenges we face as teachers is that thinking is invisible. I don’t always know what’s going on in a kid’s head.” Shade said. “The audio and video apps on the Chromebook gave us a lot more insight into the thinking processes kids find themselves in.” RHIANNON SAEGERT can be reached at 940-566-6897 and via Twitter at @missmusetta. LEARN THE LINGO Chromebooks — Simple laptop computers that run Google’s Chrome operating system. Chromebooks turn on quickly and immediately put the user online using Google Chrome. While Google Classroom is specialized for educational needs and connectivity, Chromebooks also allow users to keep a Google calendar (which shares data across handheld devices using apps), store files and find free and paid apps. Chromebooks don’t have a disc drive, and users can’t download software they might be used to using on a computer running Windows or Mac OS. LEARN THE LINGO Google Hangouts — A free video and text chat application that can be integrated into Google+, Google Drive and YouTube. Google Hangouts can be used to make phone calls — including international calls. Google Slides — A Microsoft PowerPoint-esque application that lets students put together slideshow presentations and then share them through Google Drive. Unlike PowerPoint, students can work together on the same Slides project from different devices. Students can imbed links and YouTube videos into their slideshows. Google Classroom — An app that allows teachers to share classroom materials and stay in communication with their students. Teachers can share files and links, hold discussions and answer questions. Students can also use Classroom to work together when an assignment calls for it. Comments DentonRC.com is now using Facebook Comments.

ITProPortal Search RSS News Features Analysis Guides Reviews Categories Business Hardware Security Software Mobile Enterprise Cloud Networks Public Sector Startups Web What Google's Project Fi means for mobile operators By Dave Fraser Shares Earlier this year Google revealed it had amassed more than one billion Gmail users globally. Gmail is the seventh Google service to reach that imposing milestone; not bad for something which, to begin with, was available by invitation only. Google’s U.S. MVNO, Project Fi, has itself just emerged from its invite-only infancy and speculation as to its growth prospects is rife within the mobile industry. Last month Google announced a deal which sees Hutchison’s MVNE Hue providing European roaming services for Project Fi. The deal raised the prospect of a full Fi deployment in one or more European markets, and the internationalisation of an aggregated connectivity service proposition from one of the world’s most powerful and disruptive companies. What is Project Fi? Incumbent mobile operators are doubtless observing with something between interest and trepidation. Google’s positioning of the operation is ambiguous; projects can be side-line experiments or undertakings on the grandest scale. Pitching Fi as a project allows Google to show a little deference to the operator ‘partners’ supplying the cellular access, while also hinting at a far wider plan to force fundamental evolution in smartphone connectivity provision. In the Project Fi model, after all, mobile operators are played off against one another on a connection by connection basis. In the U.S. there are three suppliers competing to offer the best quality service at any given moment. And as the MVNO’s brand reminds us Wi-Fi — in particular the Wi-Fi shared for free by all manner of businesses and public locations to enhance the customer or visitor experience they offer — is a key ingredient in the service. The trick is in the mix In a blog post earlier this year which coincided with Project Fi being made available to all U.S. users, Google shared some of the early learnings from its MVNO play. Second on the list was the observation that high quality public Wi-Fi is both abundant, and well used by Project Fi’s early customers. For this most innovative of MVNOs, the trick’s in the mix. This is a service designed to reflect current smartphone user behaviour and thinking. It displays an understanding that, wherever the consumer goes, they want the best connectivity they can get. That could mean the cheapest, it could mean the best quality; ideally it has to be both. Project Fi recognises the importance of Wi-Fi — in particular public Wi-Fi — in meeting this demand and makes it part of a seamless, managed connectivity service. Meanwhile, auto-connecting to Wi-Fi offers Google a low-cost connectivity option which helps it to minimise its wholesale cellular costs and makes it easier to offer refunds for unused cellular data. Most mobile operators prefer to let their customers manage their own Wi-Fi connectivity, even as they promote services like Wi-Fi calling which depend on a connection being made to be of any value. Given how complex and frustrating it can be connecting to public Wi-Fi, and given the huge variations in quality of connection, operators are largely missing the chance to add value to this crucial part of the smartphone user experience. Research published by analyst firm Parks Associates last month revealed that two thirds of U.S. consumers who are likely to switch carriers in the next year felt access to Wi-Fi as part of their mobile service would be 'very important' to their decision. Within the survey that ranked Wi-Fi connectivity as a more compelling piece of the proposition than a loyalty rewards program, the chance of an early handset upgrade, or a long contract to offset upfront costs — and equally attractive as the ability to roll over unused data. Wi-Fi and rollover — both key elements of Project Fi — were second only to good customer service on customer wish lists. It is not difficult to understand what has prevented mobile operators embracing shared public Wi-Fi. It is fragmented in terms of ownership, ease of access, and quality of experience. It is not the kind of network they are used to. But, crucially, it is the kind of network consumers are used to. And there are ways in which the fragmentation can be overcome to ensure a great user experience. Project Fi has broken ground and Google is clearly in expansionist mode in its home market. It is a model other MVNOs can and will seek to replicate, one which leaves mobile operators having to compete to provide wholesale capacity connection by connection, and one which is explicit in its recognition of the value of public Wi-Fi. It is a model attuned to consumer demand. Google has an awful lot of customers to win before it can achieve global scale for Project Fi, of course. But mobile operators have an awful lot of customers to lose.

In May this year, a jury ruled in favor of Google, saying that Google's infringement of Oracle's copyright was fair use. Now the database software giant's lawyers are trying to get that result overturned. Oracle attorney Annette Hurst is reported (here and here) to have told district judge William Alsup in San Francisco, California, on Wednesday, that Google hadn’t – at the time of the second trial – disclosed its plans to put Android apps "on millions of consumer desktops and laptops." That, according to Oracle, would be a game changer that challenges Java SE – aka Java on the desktop. According to the Courthouse News Service, Hurst asked that Alsup overturn the "fair use" verdict of the second trial on that basis. "They worked on it for months in secret," CNS quoted Hurst as saying. "They knew it. Google had an obligation to disclose it, and it was a game changer." Hurst was referring to Google’s May 19 announcement this year that Android apps in the Google Play store could be installed were on Chromebooks. May 19 was also the day Oracle wrapped up its evidence presentation for the second trial. In other words, right after Oracle finished up, Google said it was going to allow Android apps to run on desktop machines, meaning Android's infringement of Oracle's copyright would extend beyond smartphones and tablets. Google's attorney Christa Anderson, however, reportedly retorted on Wednesday that Oracle had referenced the Android App Runtime for Chrome (ARC) in its pre-trial expert reports at the time and said nothing stopped Oracle from cross-examining Google's witnesses about ARC. Oracle's legal team shot back, telling the court that the ARC demonstrated during the second trial did not target desktops and laptops – that was a surprise strategically held off by Google, allegedly. ® Sponsored: Magic quadrant for enterprise mobility management suites Tips and corrections 30 Comments Whitepapers OpenStack brings agility to cloud platforms FICO needed an agile platform to provide its analytic cloud services to mid-sized businesses.

Ford Motor Co., aiming to put fully autonomous vehicles into the economy by 2021, announced that it’s doubling the size of its office in Silicon Valley to 260 people and investing in four companies that are key to building self-driving cars. The carmaker’s move follows more than $1 billion in investments made by Detroit-based General Motors Co. in a pair of California technology companies this year to keep up with Google’s autonomous-car project and Uber Technologies Inc.’s ride-hailing business. While the old-school mechanical engineering remains in the Midwest as does most low-skilled factory work, these investments show Detroit carmakers have realized that they must go to the nation’s technology center to find the software expertise needed to make tomorrow’s autos. Traditional automakers now directly employ hundreds in Silicon Valley, also home to Tesla Motors Inc., based in Palo Alto, California. “The shift to California is undeniable,” said Eric Noble, president of the CarLab consulting firm in Orange, California. “The technological development for autonomous vehicles and intelligent cars will continue to be done in Northern California because that’s where the knowledge is.” Ford and GM, racing to stay among the technology leaders, face a few tough realities. Companies like Google and Uber threaten to upend the industry by turning car owners and drivers into passengers who simply pay for a ride. And even though the carmakers and the region are developing tech talent, Silicon Valley is still ground zero for the people who write code, create driverless algorithms and come up with new business models. Ford has invested in Velodyne Lidar Inc., which develops the laser-based sensors that are the eyes of self-driving cars, and 3-D mapping company Civil Maps, both in California. The Dearborn, Michigan-based carmaker also acquired SAIPS, an Israeli-based computer vision and artificial intelligence designer, and it reached a licensing agreement with Nirenberg Neuroscience LLC. Its founder has developed a machine-vision platform that Ford said can bring humanlike intelligence to self-driving cars. Michigan isn’t giving up on talent, Governor Rick Snyder said in June. Snyder said one of Michigan’s biggest challenges is getting the word out that it has great resources for technology companies, especially in the auto industry. With the University of Michigan focusing on software and technology development, the talent and education system is available for any company, he said.. Plus the state has much lower costs of living and doing business than California, especially with real estate prices rising fast in Silicon Valley. Detroit’s unemployment rate is 5.8 percent compared with 4.1 percent in the San Jose, California area, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Snyder in June unveiled Planet M, an advertising and marketing campaign to tell technology companies that the state has the education and industrial base to be home to new auto technology research and start-ups. “If you look at any place in the world, we have highly developed building blocks,” he said.

But while we think we know what we are doing, using filters, incognito browsers and deleting our history, you might not be protecting yourself as much as you think. Leading privacy advocate and founder of MeWe.com Mark Weinstein knows more than most. While millions of people are taking to ad blockers, that doesn’t solve the underlying and relentless tracking that we are all subject to. Taking these simple actions can strongly enhance your privacy. 1. Surf the Internet with safe browsers Check what browser you're using (Photo: Google Chrome) All browsers are not created equal. For starters, look into your browser’s privacy settings and increase them where possible. Also, be aware that certain browsers such as Google Chrome for example, tie back into the entire Google ecosystem to build a deeper footprint. Personally, I recommend browsers such as the Tor browser, that wipe your tracks clean when you’re online. The less history you have, the more freedom of choice and privacy you receive. Read More Facebook introduces 'secret message' service with self-destruct feature - here's how you switch it on 2. Be careful where you search Be careful what you look up (Photo: PA) At Google, the searches you conduct are used to build a data history/packet of information about you, which is then used for many things, including the likelihood that it is shared or may be shared in the future with other companies, governments, etc. Of course it feeds their data and targeted marketing efforts. Alternatively, DuckDuckGo doesn’t keep your search history or create a data packet about you. While newer European regulations are intended to protect us better from this data whale, in fact Google is fighting and attempting to subvert these regulations. 3. WhatsApp is not as private as you think Don't just trust WhatsApp (Photo: Getty Images) For hundreds of millions of people, WhatsApp is their go-to app for truly private, encrypted chat conversations. Ah, if only WhatsApp was as private as they’ve promised. First the good news - WhatsApp now has world-leading encryption, the very best currently available, and is quite unlikely to be hacked. Now the reality check - get off WhatsApp! Facebook owns them and the problem is that the language within Facebook’s privacy policy clearly states that it can receive (and thus mine) information from partners to whom it jointly offers services, such as WhatsApp. What does this mean to you? It means that Facebook is tracking and storing data on who you are talking to, along with when you are talking to them, and where you are when you are posting. They also use this data to target ads to you when you are on other sites. Facebook’s new experiment with encrypted chat at Facebook Messenger suffers the same fate. Where can you turn? I founded MeWe, and there's also CyberDust. Both are much better at protecting your privacy, not tracking you, and both offer encrypted chat without algorithmic tracking/targeting/data packeting. Read More Facebook introduces 'scary' new setting that you have to opt out of - here's what you have to do 4. Use encrypted cloud storage Cloud storage might not be the best option (Photo: Microsoft/Apple/Google) There are countless cloud storage providers out there, however what you want are ones that can’t see your information. SpiderOak for example, encrypts your files on your device and then uploads them to its datacenter. That means you’re sending an encrypted copy of your files that SpiderOak can’t decrypt in the first place. Edward Snowden recommends SpiderOak by the way... 5. Social Networking is changing Facebook is collecting information (Photo: Getty) Facebook has never hidden the fact that they believe in a vastly open world and open information sharing across and within borders. Sadly that powerful vision always included continuous privacy infractions and content manipulation along with incessant targeted advertisement strategies. Social media is undergoing a significant transformation with Pew Research now identifying millennials as the demographic most concerned about their online privacy. New social network companies are at banging at the foot of Facebook’s mountain, offering better communication tech along with respect and privacy too. What’s the next big threat to privacy? Apple CEO Tim Cook has spoken about the risk to privacy Governments around the world are demanding backdoor access into apps and devices and this is a big threat to privacy globally and locally. A lot is at risk here. Backdoors are not just about surveillance; they also enable hackers to steal your data directly and steal data from companies, banks, etc. The argument for giving governments such power in order to protect us against terrorism also naively assumes that the government or leaders will only use these doors for individual instances of national safety. And there’s a big difference between giving a backdoor to Germany versus North Korea, and unfortunately governments are not always the good guys. Weighing the pros and cons, I understand Tim Cook and Apple’s continuing insistence that while a back door may sound good in theory, in reality it doesn’t. Hackers around the world will be attempting to crack the code on the back door. This is an evolving conversation and let’s keep in mind that technology is constantly changing and there may come better ways to track and identify people who are dangerous without compromising the privacy protections of encryption.

Your reactions might be giving away more than you think (Photo: Facebook) In the past 10 years, we’ve given up a large part of our online privacy to take advantage of fun, popular, and useful digital media technology, but today people have awakened to the laundry this ecstasy has created. People on Facebook engaged with their friends 21 per cent less in just one year. Pew Research reports that millennials are now the demographic most concerned about their online privacy. European countries and citizens are suing Facebook and Google for their privacy infractions. Law student Max Schrems in Austria is world renown for his class action lawsuit against Facebook. Recently the government of Belgium warned its citizens that by using Facebook’s new 'Reactions' all the people were doing was to give Facebook more data. The head of the French police has even advised parents that they can be sued by their children in the future for posting pictures of them on Facebook. There is a clear fork in the road, and the momentum has turned in the direction of privacy and respect in partnership with great communication technology and non-tracking revenue models. The next decade for privacy is likely to be fascinating with dramatic battlegrounds and entrepreneurs inventing solutions challenging the very notion that privacy was ever nearly extinct. poll loading Do you trust the big companies to keep your information private? 0+ VOTES SO FAR YES NO Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Daily Newsletter Follow @MirrorTech Subscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribe Comments Show more comments More On WhatsApp Facebook Apple Google Apps Social Networking tech all Most Read Most Recent Black FridayApple announces one-day Black Friday event: Your chance to pick up cheap iPhones and iPads The company has traditionally avoided Black Friday but appears to be making an exception for 2016's event Black FridayWhere to find the best Playstation deals online on Black Friday 2016 Have you got your eye on anything in particular for Black Friday?

August 18, 2016 Max Chafkin Subscribe Reprints Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp Source: Uber Uber’s modified Volvo XC90 sport-utility vehicle. Near the end of 2014, Uber co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick flew to Pittsburgh on a mission: to hire dozens of the world’s experts in autonomous vehicles. The city is home to Carnegie Mellon University’s robotics department, which has produced many of the biggest names in the newly hot field. Sebastian Thrun, the creator of Google’s self-driving car project, spent seven years researching autonomous robots at CMU, and the project’s former director, Chris Urmson, was a CMU grad student. “Travis had an idea that he wanted to do self-driving,” says John Bares, who had run CMU’s National Robotics Engineering Center for 13 years before founding Carnegie Robotics, a Pittsburgh-based company that makes components for self-driving industrial robots used in mining, farming, and the military. “I turned him down three times. But the case was pretty compelling.” Bares joined Uber in January 2015 and by early 2016 had recruited hundreds of engineers, robotics experts, and even a few car mechanics to join the venture. The goal: to replace Uber’s more than 1 million human drivers with robot drivers—as quickly as possible. The plan seemed audacious, even reckless. And according to most analysts, true self-driving cars are years or decades away. Kalanick begs to differ. “We are going commercial,” he says in an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek. “This can’t just be about science.” Travis Kalanick, CEO of Uber Photograph: Britta Pedersen/Picture-Alliance/DPA via AP Starting later this month, Uber will allow customers in downtown Pittsburgh to summon self-driving cars from their phones, crossing an important milestone that no automotive or technology company has yet achieved. Google, widely regarded as the leader in the field, has been testing its fleet for several years, and Tesla Motors offers Autopilot, essentially a souped-up cruise control that drives the car on the highway. Earlier this week, Ford announced plans for an autonomous ride-sharing service. But none of these companies has yet brought a self-driving car-sharing service to market. Uber’s Pittsburgh fleet, which will be supervised by humans in the driver’s seat for the time being, consists of specially modified Volvo XC90 sport-utility vehicles outfitted with dozens of sensors that use cameras, lasers, radar, and GPS receivers. Volvo Cars has so far delivered a handful of vehicles out of a total of 100 due by the end of the year. The two companies signed a pact earlier this year to spend $300 million to develop a fully autonomous car that will be ready for the road by 2021. The Volvo deal isn’t exclusive; Uber plans to partner with other automakers as it races to recruit more engineers. In July the company reached an agreement to buy Otto, a 91-employee driverless truck startup that was founded earlier this year and includes engineers from a number of high-profile tech companies attempting to bring driverless cars to market, including Google, Apple, and Tesla. Uber declined to disclose the terms of the arrangement, but a person familiar with the deal says that if targets are met, it would be worth 1 percent of Uber’s most recent valuation. That would imply a price of about $680 million. Otto’s current employees will also collectively receive 20 percent of any profits Uber earns from building an autonomous trucking business. Otto has developed a kit that allows big-rig trucks to steer themselves on highways, in theory freeing up the driver to nap in the back of the cabin. The system is being tested on highways around San Francisco. Aspects of the technology will be incorporated into Uber’s robot livery cabs and will be used to start an Uber-like service for long-haul trucking in the U.S., building on the intracity delivery services, like Uber Eats, that the company already offers. The Otto deal is a coup for Uber in its simmering battle with Google, which has been plotting its own ride-sharing service using self-driving cars. Otto’s founders were key members of Google’s operation who decamped in January, because, according to Otto co-founder Anthony Levandowski, “We were really excited about building something that could be launched early.” Volvo is expected to deliver a total of 100 specially modified SUVs to Uber by the end of the year. Source: Courtesy Uber Levandowski, one of the original engineers on the self-driving team at Google, started Otto with Lior Ron, who served as the head of product for Google Maps for five years; Claire Delaunay, a Google robotics lead; and Don Burnette, another veteran Google engineer. Google suffered another departure earlier this month when Urmson announced that he, too, was leaving. “The minute it was clear to us that our friends in Mountain View were going to be getting in the ride-sharing space, we needed to make sure there is an alternative [self-driving car],” says Kalanick. “Because if there is not, we’re not going to have any business.” Developing an autonomous vehicle, he adds, “is basically existential for us.” (Google also invests in Uber through Alphabet’s venture capital division, GV.) Unlike Google and Tesla, Uber has no intention of manufacturing its own cars, Kalanick says. Instead, the company will strike deals with auto manufacturers, starting with Volvo Cars, and will develop kits for other models. The Otto deal will help; the company makes its own laser detection, or lidar, system, used in many self-driving cars. Kalanick believes that Uber can use the data collected from its app, where human drivers and riders are logging roughly 100 million miles per day, to quickly improve its self-driving mapping and navigation systems. “Nobody has set up software that can reliably drive a car safely without a human,” Kalanick says. “We are focusing on that.” In Pittsburgh, customers will request cars the normal way, via Uber’s app, and will be paired with a driverless car at random. Trips will be free for the time being, rather than the standard local rate of $1.05 per mile. In the long run, Kalanick says, prices will fall so low that the per-mile cost of travel, even for long trips in rural areas, will be cheaper in a driverless Uber than in a private car. “That could be seen as a threat,” says Volvo Cars CEO Hakan Samuelsson. “We see it as an opportunity.”  Uber to Launch Self-Driving Cars in Pittsburgh This Month Although Kalanick and other self-driving car advocates say the vehicles will ultimately save lives, they face harsh scrutiny for now. In July a driver using Tesla’s Autopilot service died after colliding with a tractor-trailer, apparently because both the driver and the car’s computers didn’t see it. (The crash is currently being investigated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.) Google has seen a handful of accidents, but they’ve been less severe, in part because it limits its prototype cars to 25 miles per hour. Uber’s cars haven’t had any fender benders since they began road-testing in Pittsburgh in May, but at some point something will go wrong, according to Raffi Krikorian, the company’s engineering director. “We’re interacting with reality every day,” he says. “It’s coming.” For now, Uber’s test cars travel with safety drivers, as common sense and the law dictate. These professionally trained engineers sit with their fingertips on the wheel, ready to take control if the car encounters an unexpected obstacle. A co-pilot, in the front passenger seat, takes notes on a laptop, and everything that happens is recorded by cameras inside and outside the car so that any glitches can be ironed out. Each car is also equipped with a tablet computer in the back seat, designed to tell riders that they’re in an autonomous car and to explain what’s happening. “The goal is to wean us off of having drivers in the car, so we don’t want the public talking to our safety drivers,” Krikorian says. On a recent weekday test drive, the safety drivers were still an essential part of the experience, as Uber’s autonomous car briefly turned un-autonomous, while crossing the Allegheny River. A chime sounded, a signal to the driver to take the wheel. A second ding a few seconds later indicated that the car was back under computer control. “Bridges are really hard,” Krikorian says. “And there are like 500 bridges in Pittsburgh.” Bridges are hard in part because of the way that Uber’s system works. Over the past year and a half, the company has been creating extremely detailed maps that include not just roads and lane markings, but also buildings, potholes, parked cars, fire hydrants, traffic lights, trees, and anything else on Pittsburgh's streets. As the car moves, it collects data, and then using a large, liquid-cooled computer in the trunk, it compares what it sees with the preexisting maps to identify (and avoid) pedestrians, cyclists, stray dogs, and anything else. Bridges, unlike normal streets, offer few environmental cues—there are no buildings, for instance—making it hard for the car to figure out exactly where it is. Uber cars have Global Positioning System sensors, but those are only accurate within about 10 feet; Uber’s systems strive for accuracy down to the inch. When the Otto acquisition closes, likely this month, Otto co-founder Levandowski will assume leadership of Uber’s driverless car operation, while continuing to oversee his company's robotic trucking business. The plan is to open two additional Uber R&D centers, one in the Otto office, a cavernous garage in San Francisco’s Soma neighborhood, a second in Palo Alto. “I feel like we’re brothers from another mother,” Kalanick says of Levandowski. The two men first met at the TED conference in 2012, when Levandowski was showing off an early version of Google’s self-driving car. Kalanick offered to buy 20 of the prototypes on the spot—“It seemed like the obvious next step,” he says with a laugh—before Levandowski broke the bad news to him. The cars were running on a loop in a closed course with no pedestrians; they wouldn't be safe outside the TED parking lot. “It was like a roller coaster with no track,” Levandowski explains. “If you were to step in front of the vehicle, it would have just run you over.” Kalanick began courting Levandowski this spring, broaching the possibility of an acquisition during a series of 10-mile night walks from the Soma neighborhood where Uber is also headquartered to the Golden Gate Bridge. The two men would leave their offices separately—to avoid being seen by employees, the press, or competitors. They’d grab takeout food, then rendezvous near the city’s Ferry Building. Levandowski says he saw a union as a way to bring the company’s trucks to market faster.  For his part, Kalanick sees it as a way to further corner the market for autonomous driving engineers. “If Uber wants to catch up to Google and be the leader in autonomy, we have to have the best minds,” he says, and then clarifies: “We have to have all the great minds.”   —With Eric Newcomer (Corrects Uber’s normal per-mile rate in Pittsburgh in the twelfth paragraph.) artificial intelligence uber cars AI Driverless Cars Companies & Industries Pittsburgh services Tech Uber Technologies Inc Terms of Service Trademarks Privacy Policy ©2016 Bloomberg L.P.

Google said it wants to create a new set "with a goal of highlighting the diversity of women's careers and empowering girls everywhere." (Google via AP) 0 By Aditya Madanapalle /  18 Aug 2016 , 16:12 Emoji are smileys that originated in Japanese mobile phones in the early 90s. They were adopted by Apple and then by Android. Emoji have found their way into the Unicode character set, which is a set of specifications widely used in applications, the world wide web and operating systems. The purpose of Unicode is to allow people around the world to use computers in their native languages. New characters are put on a road map, and included in timely updates to the Unicode standard. The proliferation of an increasing number of emoji can push back accessibility in regional, dead or obscure languages. This hampers the timely use of these languages with computers by people speaking in local, regional languages as well as researchers and students working with esoteric languages. Apple’s Emoji Pack for Women. Image Credits: Apple Earlier this month, Apple launched a new emoji pact aimed at promoting gender equality. In June this year, Facebook added emoji packs for Messenger that celebrated diversity by giving people more gender and skin colour options to express themselves in. Google proposed the inclusion of female gender emoji to the Unicode consortium in May this year. The idea was to better represent professional women. The question is, does emoji really need to get more diverse? Here is a standard set of emoji. They are all gender neutral, and can be used by anyone for self expression. Black, white, male, female, it is just an emoticon in the end. Adding colours and genders actually introduces racial and gender differences in a character set that has none. There is no reason why emoji for professions or activities should not follow the same, neutral format. Moreover, adding gender specific emoji can alienate transgender and genderqueer people, and support gender stereotypes in the specific implementation. Here is a letter to the Unicode consortium on the proposed gender update, from a respondent known only as E. The proposed gender distinctions follow outdated gender stereotypes, and they render trans and genderqueer people invisible. PREGNANT WOMAN needs more gender options because people with very different genders (and gendered looks) have the ability to get pregnant. Trans and intersex men as well as genderqueer people might all be able to. They are not represented by a pregnant woman emoji. BRIDE WITH VEIL is cliché, anyone getting married could wear a veil. It needs more gender options. MAN IN TUXEDO and MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT LEVITATING also need more gender options, why would only men wear these types of clothes? Women and genderqueer people can and do wear these and are not represented. Facebook’s “more diverse” emoji. Image: AP Gendered emoji just introduces more complications, more characters, more stereotypes and at the same time, alienates all of those who are not represented by these “diverse” emoji. A global standard, especially one that is future looking is better off not implementing gendered emoji. Instead of implementing emoji for three or more genders in five or more skin shades to represent diversity, it is better to implement each expression in a neutral gender and colour, as it has historically been represented.

ITProPortal Search RSS News Features Analysis Guides Reviews Categories Business Hardware Security Software Mobile Enterprise Cloud Networks Public Sector Startups Web Google's appeal rejected in Russian antimonopoly case By Anthony Spadafora Shares Google is once again under pressure as a result of the way in which it bundles apps on its Android mobile platform. The company had previously been involved in an antitrust dispute with the European Commission over the apps that are included on its mobile operating system. Now Google is facing a similar case in Russia. Last week, the Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) found that the company's apps, which are often pre-installed on Android devices by their manufacturers, made it difficult for other app developers to compete. The watchdog, then fined Google 438 million rubles or around $6.8 million for taking advantage of its power within the Android ecosystem. Google has appealed the FAS's decision but a spokesperson from the Russian antitrust watchdog has revealed that a Russian appeals court has rejected the appeal. This news came after it was revealed that FAS and the company had been unsuccessful at settling the dispute out of court. Google may still be able to dispute the antitrust charges by filing a cassation appeal. The company will have eight days to comply with the watchdog's original demands once the court has finalised its ruling. If Google fails to do this, it could face another fine in addition to the $6.8 million from FAS. According to a spokeswoman from Google Russia, Google has not yet received the full text of the decision and will determine how to proceed once it does.

Google to Add Audio Calls Support in Duo GO The application also supports video calls Aug 18, 2016 09:48 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Just two days ago, Google launched the global rollout of one of its most promising communications application, Google Duo, which has been rather well received, mainly thanks to its simplistic interface and straightforward features. Now it seems that the Mountain View-based giant is looking to add new features to the app. One of the main advantages of Google's Duo app is that it offers an easy way to place video calls, without the hassle of adjusting multiple settings and going through a menu with various features. However, its simplistic feel might not be to the liking of some users, but Google is reportedly working on adding new features inside the application. Surely, an app for video calls is quite useful in the universe of applications designed for all sorts of needs. Still, it's quite a shame that a company like Google would limit the usage of such a highly anticipated app to just video calls. Audio calls could soon arrive on Google Duo, according to +Amit Fulay, product lead for communications at Google. Audio calls would be an alternative to video calling in Duo Aside from the powerful features Duo already incorporates, audio call would surely make this application more appealing to users from all over the world. Google's Duo comes with a tool that allows the application to automatically scale the video quality based on the user's connection speed. This means that the app has the capacity to switch from mobile data to WiFi if the connection isn't strong enough. The main advantage is that the application won't drop the call during the switch. Google's Duo might also fall back on audio-only if the connection gets too bad. In addition, the app would allow users to place only audio video calls if they wish. The leak mentions that the new feature will be coming soon to the Google Duo app, but it's unsure when that might actually be. Google Duo was announced during Google I/O back in May, when the company also talked about a new messaging application, Allo, unreleased yet. #Google#Google Duo#Google Allo#video calls#audio calls subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google Begins Rollout of Video Calling App Duo on Android and iOS Google’s Allo and Duo Apps Get New Icons in the Play Store Google Releases Science Journal, an Android App for Science Experiments Google Announces Family Library for Play Store, Launching July 2 iPhone 8 to Feature Traditional Wireless Charging like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Lenovo Builds a New Microsoft Surface Clone and It Looks Fabulous Anonymous Hackers Want McAfee to Be Trump’s Security Adviser, Call for March Hackers Could Infect Headphones to Spy on You HTC Desire 650 Announced, a Low Mid-End Smartphone for the Masses Glossy Black Galaxy S7 edge Leaks in Live Pictures Download Windows 10 64-bit Drivers for Acer’s Aspire TC-710 Desktop Model Intel Rolls Out Several New BIOS Versions for Its NUC Kits and Compute Sticks    Google's Duo application New Android APKs VivaVideo APK: Updated November 23rd, 14:19 GMT PowerDirector APK: Updated November 23rd, 14:08 GMT WeVideo APK: Updated November 23rd, 14:04 GMT Amazon Rapids APK: Updated November 23rd, 14:02 GMT ActionDirector APK: Updated November 23rd, 13:58 GMT DataEye APK: Updated November 23rd, 13:46 GMT JOOX APK: Updated November 23rd, 13:46 GMT Reader comments Load old comments   HTC 10 Evo Officially Introduced with 5.5-Inch QHD Display, Snapdragon 810 CPU more on: HTC 10 Evo i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Now there’s a new report talking about South Korea’s Hyundai looking to hook up with Google as well – though it’s still not clear enough if the carmaker wants in on the self-driving technology or is looking to solidify its infotainment segment. In the end we’ll see following an official announcement what Hyundai and Google might be considering – if they indeed enter a strategic partnership. Apparently, Hyundai Motor President Jeong Jin Haeng talked to media and said the groups “have some common areas that may require cooperation.” This sounds pretty vague – but we can reason to autonomous technology since Hyundai hasn’t been developing it on its own. This remains to be seen if it happens since Google already partnered with FCA to build Pacifica self-driving minivans. There could be enough room if Google negotiated a non-exclusive deal, as a few months back Google’s autonomous car project boss John Krafcik said “we’re still talking to a lot of different automakers.” By the way, the Google executive is a former CEO of Hyundai Motor America so the cooperation between the two already has a solid foundation. Hyundia may also want to further explore infotainment options with Google – the South Koreans were quick to embrace the Android Auto and Apple CarPlay systems.

Lifestyle London Life 8 rules of video calls: from Skype to FaceTime and Google Duo Never make a video call faux pas again with Phoebe Luckhurt's etiquette guide Phoebe Luckhurst Thursday 18 August 2016 09:47 BST Google Duo is designed to rival FaceTime Google Once, words were the most efficient way to communicate. They permitted explanation but also nuance and wit. They were pretty popular. Famous last words: with its latest release, Duo, a videocalling app, Google has sounded the death knell for written communication.   Technically we’ve been videocalling for a while: Skype pioneered the technology, and apps such as Apple’s FaceTime and Facebook Messenger followed. Google says Duo is innovative because it simplifies the technology: you don’t need a Google account, it’s compatible across devices, and works whether you’re on 3G or wi-fi.  But new technologies bring with them new etiquette: here are your dos and don’ts.  Don’t use it as a mirror Read more Google releases new video chat app to rival FaceTime Videocalling plays to our base narcissism, permitting the user to — technically — be hanging out with someone while really staring at himself in a mirror. Stop darting your eyes into the corner just to “check” the shape of your nose. It is vain and you’ll lose your grip on the conversation, which is offputting in itself. Don’t FaceTime a pet  Pets can’t talk and self-delusion is unattractive.   Pick your space  Read more London health chiefs plot Skype calls to halve number of appointments How a new army of nutritionists are using Skype and Instagram to bring tailor-made eating to London Skype up your life: how video messaging is being used as the medium of the masses Video calling permits you to be connected all day long, but that does not sanction an indiscriminate approach to location. For example, while it is unspokenly acceptable to text on the loo, it is not to video call someone from in there.  Don’t do it in bed It’s not sexy: you have a double chin. Also, you just dropped your phone on your face and gave the other person a swooping feeling of motion sickness. Don’t spend first five minutes laughing  Yes, it is a faint novelty seeing your mates face appear on your screen. It is not sufficiently novel — nor sufficiently amusing — to sustain five minutes of guffawing. Just get down to business... The best apps for Londoners 12 show all The best apps for Londoners 1/12 Zip car ‘Join, reserve, unlock and drive’ — it really is that simple. The capital’s preferred car club’s app gives 24/7 access to cars and vans in your neighbourhood and lets you extend or cancel reservations on the go. Free 2/12 Uncover Still on the waiting list for Chiltern Firehouse? You need Uncover, which redistributes cancelled reservations at some of the capital’s top restaurants, including The River Café and Nobu. Not for planning freaks, though — tables typically become free at 40 minutes’ notice. Free 3/12 Uber So popular it’s become a verb, this private driver service has revolutionised travel in the capital. It’s speedy and affordable, making it a welcome alternative to the night bus. Free 4/12 Santander Cycles Launched this summer, the official app for Boris’ fifth child can be used to search for nearby docking stations and check bike availability. There’s also a journey planner featuring easy, moderate and fast routes to satisfy all cycling tribes. Free 5/12 Plume Air Report This new app has been downloaded by 3,000 Londoners. Sensors gathering air pollution data submit updates every hour, resulting in a scale that ranges from ‘fresh’ to ‘extremely polluted’. Free 6/12 Nightcapp Here’s an app that will have booze hounds raising their glasses. NightCapp is a map that pinpoints more than 1,500 London watering holes that stay open past 11.30pm. It also shows users when a bar is about to close by highlighting it in orange. Better get moving. Free 7/12 Money Dashboard An award-winning budget planner, this helps you keep track of personal spending across multiple accounts, pay off credit cards and even makes suggestions on how to manage your finances better. Free 8/12 Her Promising to introduce women to ‘a lesbian that hasn’t slept with any of your friends’, this revamped dating app includes queer-themed news and blogs, upcoming event notices and an improved algorithm-matching system. Free 9/12 FoodMood This new startup, which reckons it’s ‘Tinder for food’, pledges to narrow down your choice of lunchbreak destinations. Hit ‘yum’ or ‘yuk’ on photos of dishes in your area. Juvenile, but strangely addictive. Free 10/12 Daily Yoga This offers more than 50 yoga sessions, as well as a database of 500 yoga poses. Suitable for all levels, programmes include yoga aimed at specific areas of the body and weight loss. Namaste to that. Free 11/12 Coffee Meets Bagel Billed as the ‘anti-Tinder’, this new kid on the block delivers just a single match to users once a day. Coffee Meets Bagel uses Facebook profile information to recommend suitors based on friends of friends. Neither coffee nor bagels are included. Free. 12/12 Bristlr Do you have a beard? Perhaps you’d like to stroke one on a regular basis? This can be arranged. Unlike other dating apps, Bristlr is unashamedly all about hooking up the hairy with the hairless. There’s even a beard-rating option for aficionados. Free ...not that kind of business Unless you want to make your own porn film. If so, as you were, you saucemonkey.  Don’t keep FaceTiming if someone hates it  If your friend’s face falls every time you appear, consider that they might have preferred it when they could keep you at arm’s length via WhatsApp.  Don’t do it for a serious convo  Videocalling is for larks and catch-ups, not break-ups.  Follow Phoebe Luckhurst on Twitter: @phoebeluckhurst More about: FaceTime Google Duo Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: All Topics All Authors Archive Terms of use Contact Us Privacy policy Cookie policy Code of Conduct & Complaints Advertisers Promotion rules Contributors Syndication Business Connections Homes & Property Jobs London Live The Independent This is London Magazine indy100 Install our apps Close We have noticed that you are using an ad blocker.

By Charlie Osborne for Zero Day | August 18, 2016 -- 09:01 GMT (02:01 PDT) | Topic: Security Google's Macintosh Operations team have been working on a security application destined for Apple's OS X ecosystem and has managed to attract the attention of the open-source community in the process. Dubbed "Santa," the tool is a binary whitelisting and blacklisting tool for macOS. The software consists of a "kernel extension that monitors for executions, a userland daemon that makes execution decisions based on the contents of a SQLite database, a GUI agent that notifies the user in case of a block decision and a command-line utility for managing the system and synchronizing the database with a server," according to the project's page. Santa is still in the pre-1.0 stage, but the team is hard at work writing tests, debugging and finishing up a security audit. "It is named Santa because it keeps track of binaries that are naughty or nice," Google's team says. As noted by the Register, both individual and mass-deployments are being kept in mind, as the Santa platform allows admins to manage a single accepted-and-rejected binary database. Santa can also be used in different modes. The scanner's defaults setting allows all binaries to run except those marked as blacklisted, while in "lockdown" mode, only whitelisted binaries are permitted. Santa also supports event logging, certificate-based rules with override functionality, path-based rules and failsafe certificate rules -- which prevent issues such as blocking automatic Mac updates. Google's Macintosh Operations team says: "No single system or process will stop all attacks, or provide 100 percent security. Santa is written with the intention of helping protect users from themselves. People often download malware and trust it, giving the malware credentials, or allowing unknown software to exfiltrate more data about your system. As a centrally managed component, Santa can help stop the spread of malware among a larger fleet of machines. Independently, Santa can aid in analyzing what is running on your computer. Santa is part of a defense-in-depth strategy, and you should continue to protect hosts in whatever other ways you see fit." The security software is hosted on GitHib for people interested in poking around the code or setting up initial installations. Must-have back to school, college gadgets...

This was removed in a recent Chrome update. For some, hitting backspace to go back a page when browsing the web was an efficient way of navigating; for others, it was a heartbreaking experience as they lost progress by accidentally leaving a page. Google recently got rid of this shortcut in an update to Chrome, but is now ready to make peace with those who use it to their advantage. Google released “Go Back with Backspace,” a Chrome extension that brings back the backspace navigation functionality. Those who download it will be able to use the shortcut, leaving everyone else to manually navigate back, which should cut down on work lost accidentally. In the extension’s blurb, Google explains, “Before Chrome 52, the backspace key navigated back (if you weren't writing text). Many people lost their progress while working online by accidentally pressing backspace and leaving a page -- so we removed the feature from Chrome, and created this extension for those who prefer the old behaviour.” Go Back with Backspace is now available for Google Chrome.

According to Google Product Lead for Communication Amit Fulay, the app will soon allow audio-only calls. Fulay while responding to a query in a Google+ post about the missing feature in the Duo app said it is "coming soon" without revealing an exact timeline. Google's brand new video calling app has been launched to take on Apple's FaceTime, Microsoft's Skype, Viber, and others similar services. The Duo app lets people call their phone contacts (as long as they have the app installed) and one of the biggest highlight features is it can work even on low networks.Google has already confirmed that Duo calls will be in HD quality though the app will adjust it as per the available network. Another notable feature of the Duo app is 'Knock Knock,' which essentially shows preview video of the caller and lets people decide whether to answer or not. Google has also confirmed that the Duo video calling app uses end-to-end encryption. Talking about the new Duo app, Fulay had previously said, "The way I see it, there are three pillars, first there's the user, for whom we've got apps like Allo and Duo, which are really simple and fast. So if you just want to call someone then this is what you would do. It's as easy as making a phone call. Duo is simple, it's multi-platform, it's fast, and it's focused on doing just what it does very efficiently."

Dubai Internet City Home to everyone from Google to the next big thing: Inside the Middle East's largest ICT hub Established in 2000, Dubai Internet City has become the most significant IT hub in the region. So what's changed in the past fifteen years and what are the plans for its future? Read More Launched in January, the venue is Google's first Brazilian Campus. A mix of coworking space, new venture accelerator and networking center, the place also offers courses and seminars to those interested in the digital startup scene. The selected start-ups are working on projects ranging from microcredit and sign language translation to automation tools for investments in the stock exchange and mobile gaming. The companies will be working at the Google Campus for six months -- during that time, they will get access to mentoring and immersions led by Google executives. Google won't be investing any capital in the start-ups taking part in the Campus program. The startups also don't pay to participate. The company will be launching a second selection process for Brazilian start-ups soon. Other Campuses are located in London, Madrid, Seoul, Warsaw, and Tel Aviv. The latter campus has produced start-ups such as Waze, which ended up getting bought by Google. According to the web giant, companies created within its Campuses have generated over 5,000 jobs.

The Nexus M1 is the faster of the two, and a new leak says that the new Nexus M1 will have high-end hardware, and will be just as good as any of the flagship smartphones on the market.     According to an Antutu benchmark for the "Google Nexus Marlin" found by a Weibo user 'The Malignant', the new Nexus M1 will feature the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor and 4GB of RAM. Google's new Nexus M1 will also reportedly feature 32GB of storage, a 13-megapixel rear-facing camera backed up by an 8-megapixel selfie camera. We're also expecting a 2560x1440 native resolution.   We are still waiting for the official announcement and release date of the new Nexus smartphones, which shouldn't be too much longer away, hopefully somewhere in October.   NEWS SOURCES:Bgr.com Recommended for You Google and Verizon spend $30 million a week on Pixel...

HIGHLIGHT AND SHARE Highlight text to share via Facebook and Twitter Google ADVERTISEMENT Google launched their video calling app Duo yesterday. The global roll-out began shortly after and India is among the first countries to get access to it. First announced in May at I/O, Google's annual developer conference, Duo aims to be the simplest and fastest video calling app around. And, it mostly achieves that. The search giant has not done any Google account integration with this app, which means that Google Hangouts will live as a separate app with more advanced video calling features. Duo hardly needs any time to set up. You just have to enter your phone number and a verification call will be sent to your phone. Once that is done, you're good to go. You will see a Snapchat like screen with the front camera on. If you click on the call button, you can see the list of people. At the top are people already using Duo. Then there is a list of contacts who are not on the app, along with an option to invite them. I tried calling a couple of friends from the comfort of WiFi, a moving cab and an area with 3G network. During each call, I felt no lag in the video stream. Yes, once or twice there was slight sputtering, but it wasn't ever the case that the stream was lagging by seconds. AOL During a call, there are only three buttons onscreen -- switch camera, mute, and end the call. This way, most of the screen space shows the stream from the other person. You can see your own stream in a circle in one corner of the screen. One of the app's major features is called Knock Knock, which displays the video feed of the person who called you even before you take the call. Many might not find this very helpful, so Google has made this feature optional. You can go into the settings menu and switch Knock Knock off. Google The great thing about Duo is the absence of hindrances. More than an app, it feels like a phone's inbuilt feature. Even though networks in India can be slow and erratic, I have faced no major problems so far. The quality of the video in WiFi and LTE is top notch. Yesterday, I was at a location with poor network connectivity and, so, after the initiation of the call, the video stream stopped but audio remained uninterrupted. Google Having said that, there are very few users on Duo as of now. It is to be seen how the servers respond to heavy traffic after more users are on-board. And that is where we will see the real test of the WebRTC standard. Google claims that this is one of the lightest and fastest compressions for video. (Ping me if you yell 'Pied Piper' at this moment.) Duo will face stiff competition from Skype and Facetime. Skype is a mix of personal and business video calling options, and Google can beat it with its sheer size. But replacing Facetime on Apple devices would be a monumental task for the app. Duo's product manager, Amit Fulay, suggested on his Google+ post that audio-only calling would be soon making way for Duo. The app potentially acts as a second dialler for consumers.

Podcasts & Newsletter Service Teaching German Teaching German DW im Unterricht Unterrichtsreihen Deutschlehrer-Info Germany World Business Science Environment Culture Sports TOP STORIES / Science Science Opinion: If you think software code is ethically neutral, you're lying to yourself Google evangelist, Vinton Cerf, thinks there's no room for philosophical thinking in programming self-driving cars. Just tell them not to hit things and we'll be fine. DW's Zulfikar Abbany takes issue. It was an accident waiting to happen. Despite all efforts by Joachim Müller-Jung the conversation slowly but surely swerved towards self-driving cars. Up until then, I had been rather bored. So it was Wednesday, and the third "Press Talk" at the 66th Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting. And the topic was artificial intelligence (A.I.). Müller-Jung, who's the head of science and nature at the German daily newspaper "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung," had repeatedly said during his long and winding introduction, "We're not going to talk about self-driving cars or 'rogue A.I.' here!" And the audience of journalists and young scientists laughed. He had wanted to talk about quantum mechanics and invited quantum expert, Rainer Blatt, to do just that. Google's Chief Internet Evangelist Vinton Cerf, left, and Joachim Müller-Jung of the FAZ newspaper's science and nature section, right. But Vinton (Vint) Cerf, a Google vice president and Chief Internet Evangelist, was also on the panel. So as soon as the floor was opened to questions, self-driving cars were in pole position. Google, as you may know, is at the forefront of research into self-driving cars and the artificial intelligence they will need to get us from A to B, if we so trust them. Quips about car crashes Cerf had fun regaling the audience with stories of Google's self-driving experiments and how one of their cars had hit a bus but that it was "only at about 3 kilometers per hour (2 mph)," and how in other cases Google's autonomous cars had been rear-ended by other cars, driven by humans. The stupid, slow-reacting things. But what happens, asked young scientist Mehul Malik, when a car is faced with the choice of either hitting a child in the road or swerving to avoid the child in a way that would endanger the safety of any passengers in the car. The evangelist's response was off-hand, to put it lightly. Such as befits an evangelist, Cerf has no understanding for people whose worldviews contradict his own. He said there was no point in investing self-driving cars with the philosophical concerns that we face as humans. All you have to do is instruct autonomous cars, through the software and code you write, "not to hit anything." Fuzzy logic I take issue with this idea, fundamentally. I don't have half the brains Cerf inhabits. He, after all, is one of the "fathers of the internet," having co-designed the TCP/IP software that underpins our global network of computers. He also won the 2004 Turing Award. But I know for a fact there's a problem with Cerf's logic. It's boarishly utopian. We humans are philosophical. We can empathise and get confused. We observe degrees of truth, fuzzy logic. Computers don't get confused, they either do or they don't do, according to the instructions in the software that runs them. This may make it easier for self-driving cars to react faster in dangerous situations. But it doesn't mean they will make the right decision. To repeat, we humans are philosophical. And while we may no longer do the driving, we are still the ones who want to be driven. So it's our responsibility to invest philosophy in the programming of self-driving cars. Without philosophy, we have no ethics or morals. The problem goes even deeper, however. No matter what Cerf insists, it is impossible not to invest philosophy or ethics in our computer code. As soon as a programmer begins to type, they make decisions. They have to. And those decisions are based on the way they see the world. That is their philosophy - their interests and visions of the future, humanitarian, aesthetic or commercial. For decades, tech utopians have peddled the erroneous belief that code is neutral, that it can do no wrong. It's like advocates of America's Second Amendment, the right to keep and bear arms, saying "guns don't kill people, people do." And it's equally illogical. Of course, it's people who kill. It's also people who code. And people should take responsibility for their code. For heaven's sake, take responsibility man! To suggest code is neutral and without philosophy or ethics is to suggest a future where we can happily say to bereaved parents, "I'm terribly sorry that my car ran over your child, but it was the car's fault, I was in the back having sex." Zulfikar Abbany So, Mr Cerf, let's program our self-driving cars with the highest priority instruction "not to hit anything." Fine. That in itself is a philosophy. In any case, the majority of people are programmed, or conditioned, to behave that way. But we still have accidents and self-driving cars will too. My question is, will you still be prepared to say there's not room for philosophy, for ethics, when the insurance companies refuse to pay out and the car manufacturers refuse to take responsibility for bugs in their software? You may like to try. But someone will be making a decision not to pay out and it will be based on the way they see the world.

But one major drawback to the technology, at this point, is the inability of it to always recognise accents correctly. Now, Google seems to be doing something about that. As originally spotted by Quartz, the company has seemingly contracted third-party company, Appen, to gather audio samples of accents from Reddit users. Related: Cortana vs Google Now vs Siri Yes, the search giant has turned to the 'front page of the internet' in an attempt to ensure its speech recognition software will work with even the thickest of accents in the future. The original post has now been taken down but offered Scottish Redditors £27 to record audio samples – a task which reportedly takes up to three hours. Those users that responded would have to record phrases such as “Indy now” or “Google, what’s the time?", according to Quartz's report. The ad also offered users under 17 £20 to read from a shorter, 45-minute script. Appen has been posting on a several subredddits, including /r/slavelabour, /r/WorkOnline, and /r/beermoney, as well as city-specific subreddits such as /r/Edinburgh. Google has not confirmed its involvement in the project, and there's also been no word from Appen on just what the adverts relate to. You can see a screenshot of the original advert here, as Appen appears to be taking down the posts quite quickly.

Officials from the ministries and agencies, including the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, the Foreign Ministry and the Ministry of Defense, will participate in a joint meeting in which they will decide whether to allow Google to store and use Korea’s mapping data at its global data centers. The California-based internet firm asked the Korean government for the use and storage of government-supplied geographical data on June 1 after several failed attempts in the past. The company said that it needs access to the mapping data in order to make its Google Maps data fully available in the Korean market as well as to roll out new services such as a navigation system for autonomous vehicles. The Korean government, however, rejected Google’s request, arguing information on Korea’s military facilities could fall into the hands of enemies, North Korea in particular. It said it would allow Google to make use of the Korean mapping data only if the company blurred such important geographical data, but Google has refused to do so. Some critics and local internet firms also criticized Google’s purpoted scheme to evade taxes in the Korean market by not setting up fixed facilities like data servers here. Companies with no fixed facilities are exempt from paying corporate tax in Korea. The US firm also denied the allegation, saying even if it had a data center in Korea it would have to bring the map data to global data centers to run its map services in a stable and efficient manner.

Ford Motor, aiming to put fully autonomous vehicles into the economy by 2021, announced that it's doubling the size of its office in Silicon Valley to 260 people and investing in four companies that are key to building self-driving cars. The carmaker's move follows more than $1 billion in investments made by Detroit-based General Motors in a pair of California technology companies earlier this year to keep up with Google's autonomous-car project and Uber Technologies Inc.'s ride-hailing business. While the old-school mechanical engineering remains in the Midwest as does low-skilled factory work that hasn't moved to Southern states, these investments show Detroit carmakers have realized that they must go to the nation's technology center to find the software expertise needed to make the autos of tomorrow. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Traditional automakers now directly employ hundreds in Silicon Valley, which is also home to Palo Alto-based Tesla Motors. "The shift to California is undeniable," said Eric Noble, president of the CarLab consulting firm in Orange, California. "The technological development for autonomous vehicles and intelligent cars will continue to be done in Northern California because that's where the knowledge is." Ford and GM, racing to stay among the technology leaders, face a few tough realities. Companies like Google and Uber threaten to upend the industry by turning car-owners and drivers into passengers who simply pay for a ride. And even though the carmakers and state of Michigan are developing tech talent, Silicon Valley is still ground zero for the people who write code, create driverless algorithms and come up with new business models for mobility. Ford has invested in Velodyne Lidar Inc., which develops the laser-based sensors that are the eyes of self-driving cars, and 3-D mapping company Civil Maps, both in California. The Dearborn, Mich.-based carmaker also acquired SAIPS, an Israeli-based computer vision and artificial intelligence designer, and it reached a licensing agreement with Nirenberg Neuroscience LLC. Its founder, Dr. Sheila Nirenberg, has developed a machine-vision platform that Ford said can bring humanlike intelligence to self-driving cars. "We came to Silicon Valley — there are a lot of great places around the world — but the ecosystem here is just unbelievable," Fields, standing outside on a bright, sunny day, said to reporters. "It's like a bazaar of ideas, and everybody's open." GM CEO Mary Barra last year took her top leaders to visit tech companies and venture capital firms to get their thoughts on fostering innovation. GM went on to buy a 9 percent stake in Lyft Inc., a competitor to Uber, for $500 million. GM also spent more than that to buy San Francisco-based Cruise Automation, which writes the software for autonomous driving. Owning Cruise, which has grown from 40 employees to 100, has helped GM hire people who may not have been interested in working for an automaker, Mike Ableson, GM's vice president of global product planning, said in a June interview. Some people want to remain the California environment but also have the stability of a large company, he said. Similarly, Ford's announcement may have been intended to present the maker of F-150 pickups look like an "exciting destination for human talent," Adam Jonas, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said in a research note. "There is at least a perception in the market that all the cool kids are going to places like Uber," Google, Tesla or China, he wrote. Ford and other automakers "want to change this." Michigan isn't giving up on talent, Gov. Rick Snyder, R, said in a June interview. Snyder, a former chairman of Gateway computers and founder of investment funds, pointed out that Alphabet Inc.'s Google announced in May that it will open a self-driving car research center in suburban Detroit and that Harman International Industries Inc., the audio and automotive technology company, opened its North American headquarters nearby. Amazon.com has opened a tech center in downtown Detroit. » Next page...

Students (and teachers): it’s time to go and celebrate. To all of those who picked up their results today, we wish you the best of luck with whatever you do next. If you’re not quite sure what path to take, the Guardian’s Q&A with careers advisers is kicking off now. Here’s a summary of the key points from today: The proportion of A-level students across England, Wales and Northern Ireland receiving the highest grades has fallen for a fifth year in a row, and girls have caught up with boys in attaining A* grades. In Wales there was a particularly big drop in A* grades, from 7.3% to 6.6%, including a fall of more than a full percentage point among boys, from 7.8% to 6.7%. A record number of A-level students – 424,000 – have achieved a place at university, up 3% from last year, according to Ucas. The number of EU students placed in UK universities rose to 26,800 – an increase of 11% and the highest figure on record, despite fears that Brexit might deter students from applying. Education experts have raised concerns about the falling number of students taking creative subjects and modern languages. Entries to languages are down, with the number taking French falling by 6%. Maths was the most popular subject for the second year in a row, ahead of English, and greater numbers took further maths. Psychology continues to grow in popularity behind biology in third place.

Photograph: Ormiston Shelfield Community Academy in Walsall Ormiston Shelfield Community Academy in Walsall, West Midlands, has got in touch to tell us about its students’ A-level grades. The academy is celebrating record results and is especially proud of this group of students – they’re set to follow a range of paths, including an accountancy apprenticeship, apprenticeships at Rolls Royce and medicine at a Russell Group university. Toby Salt, chief executive of Ormiston Academies Trust, which sponsors Shelfield Academy, said: “I am immensely proud of these students and of OAT’s part in their success. We have always been a trust prepared to take on the toughest educational challenges and many of our academies are in less affluent areas – but we are absolutely committed to providing all young people with the opportunities their better-off peers have, so that they too can fulfil their potential.” Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.31am EDT 08:31 Yesterday, we heard from a group of A-level students waiting to get their results. One was Tabetha Scott, a 33-year-old full-time mum from Hertfordshire, who has got back in touch today to let us know that she successfully achieved the B in biology she needed to study midwifery. Tabetha Scott Photograph: Tabetha Scott/GuardianWitness She said she had managed to complete assignments around her two-year-old’s naps and during “bedtime study sessions”. She added: “It’s been exhausting. But, whatever the outcome, it’s been one of the best things I’ve ever done.” And her dedication paid off, as she is now on her way to study midwifery. “I achieved a B which is what I was hoping for and I have been accepted onto my course,” she confirmed today. “I’m very happy and relieved.” “I still have to finalise the fine details of my son’s childcare arrangements and finish the bursary application. Once everything is set up for September I think I’ll be able to celebrate the start of my new adventure.” Updated at 8.49am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.24am EDT 08:24 A-level results day normally involves pictures of young women jumping in the air. But here is a student who – despite being a clog dancer and therefore presumably great at jumping – has her feet firmly on the ground. Robyn Wallace, 17, from Littleborough, near Rochdale, managed to not only set up her own 50-strong clog dancing club, but also won at the European Brass Band Championships where she played percussion, PA reports.

She said: “We practise once a week in a pub, so I make sure I have time to revise for my A-level exams around that. “I’m not sure what’s going to happen when I go to Sheffield - there aren’t any clubs set up around there because clog dancing seems to be a Lancashire thing, so I might have to take the initiative myself. “None of my friends take part in it. I’ve told them about it and they look at me like I’ve got six heads.” Updated at 8.50am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.39am EDT 07:39 The Russell Group, which represents research intensive universities, has said it welcomes the large numbers of students taking traditional subjects, but adds that it is concerned about the fall in numbers studying foreign languages. A spokesperson said: “If the UK is to engage fully with the wider world in business, diplomacy and academia, we need more young people studying languages. “The continued popularity of maths, and increase in entries for further maths is welcome. Many of our universities require these subjects for their degree courses, particularly for science, engineering, economics and mathematics itself. The future prospects of students and the success of the UK economy are boosted by greater numbers taking maths and sciences.” Next month the group will launch a new resource for teachers to help them advise students on post-16 subject choices.

She said: “For many, this will be a day of joy and opportunity, allowing them to pursue new chapters of their lives whether that be work, training, or further study. A heartfelt thanks also to parents, teachers and school leaders who have helped thousands of young people on their journey.” She also praised staff and students for doing their best amid “unmanaged, ill-thought-out” education reforms from the government. Updated at 8.10am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.18am EDT 07:18 In addition to concerns about the number of students taking creative subjects, experts have highlighted the lack of young people achieving qualifications that could lead to careers in engineering. Prof Will Stewart, vice-president of the Institution of Engineering and Technology, said not enough students were taking the subjects that would enable a career in the sector, such as physics and design and technology. He said: “If we don’t reverse this trend, thousands of young people are effectively closing the door on an exciting, creative career. We are also at risk of stifling economic growth if we do not produce the future engineers we so critically need. “There continues to be huge demand for engineers so it is important that young people continue their studies into higher education. The country needs more people studying science and engineering subjects at university and taking up apprenticeships.” Updated at 8.12am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.00am EDT 07:00 Gender gap in subject choices persists Pamela Duncan Here’s some more detail on the gender gap in students’ subject choice, from Pamela Duncan. The gender gap remained evident in certain subjects this year, most notably in computing where fewer than one in 10 students sitting the exam were female. If there is any light at the end of the coding tunnel it is that this year’s female participation level actually marked an improvement on 2015, when just 8.5% of those taking the exam were girls. Of the 35,000 students who took physics just 22% were female. They almost made up a third of those who sat economics. Conversely just one in 10 male students took performing/expressive arts while just one in five students who sat Welsh exams were boys. Below are the 10 subjects most dominated by male and female students. gender gap Updated at 7.37am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.58am EDT 06:58 Too many students "held back by their background", warns access body Les Ebdon, director of Fair Access to Higher Education, was welcomed the “significant increase” in the number of students from the least advantaged backgrounds being offered a university place. But he adds: “The gap in participation is still too wide. The most advantaged young people are still 2.5 times more likely to enter higher education than their more disadvantaged peers. While we celebrate the achievements of thousands of talented young people today, we must not forget that there are many more who have the talent to excel in higher education but are being held back by their background.” Updated at 7.23am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.55am EDT 06:55 Rachel Obordo Rohan Yadav, a student from King Edward VI Grammar School in Chelmsford, achieved 6 A*s.

In an interview with Bloomberg, which took place after a meeting between the ministry of trade and local car makers, Jeong said that Hyundai and the tech giant had common areas that could result in cooperation. Despite speculation amongst analysts and pundits, he refused confirm if the areas of interest included self-driving technology. Unlike some other major automakers, such as Ford, GM and Nissan, Hyundai has yet to announce any major efforts in developing autonomous vehicles. Above: Google self-driving vehicle. If Hyundai and Google do work together on autonomous vehicle technology, the path may be smoothed by the fact that the former head of Hyundai USA, John Krafcik, is now the head of Google’s self-driving car project. It’s unknown at this stage what type of autonomous vehicle collaboration the two companies might engage in. In May, Google and Fiat Chrysler announced a deal that would see the two companies jointly develop a self-driving version of the new Chrysler Pacifica people mover. At present, the two companies plan on making 100 self-driving Pacificas that will join Google’s autonomous vehicle test fleet.

Don't let the titles confuse you; campaign chair Paul Manafort is still in charge, probably! (Although this is kind of how things started out with Lewandowski's ouster.) Meanwhile, the roles of campaign boss, campaign overlord and campaign vizier have yet to be filled. Also in today's FTR: The FBI hands over classified documents related to the Clinton email investigation, Breitbart joins the ranks of the poll spinners and voting booths will soon become the next Google Hangout. Let's go! Breitbart now part of poll-manipulation plot According to Zip, the new question and answer smartphone app, 84% of its users agree that the polls for Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are rigged. (Though the question doesn't specify exactly who the polls are rigged for, we're going to assume that they're not rigged against Clinton, who's riding an 18-poll win streak.) The question of skewed, biased or deliberately rigged polls is pretty serious, so conservative news/politics website Breitbart is jumping into the polling business. “It’s an open secret that polls are often manipulated and spun to create momentum for a particular candidate or issue,” said Alex Marlow, the editor-in-chief of Breitbart News. He promised that Breitbart's results would deliver the results "without the mainstream media filter.” The results of the first survey? Clinton leads by 5 among likely voters in a four-way race, which puts it right about in the middle of what the past week's worth of surveys have said. In other words, the poll-rigging conspiracy goes way, way deeper than anyone had suspected. (BTW, welcome to the mainstream media cabal, Alex! Check in with Cameron at the registration desk to learn the secret handshake.) We lost track of what sequel number this is Much like the "American Pie" film series, the Clinton email scandal somehow keeps churning out new episodes. The latest: Congressional Republicans have received documents from the FBI which summarize the now-closed investigation into Hillary's private email server. Last month, FBI Director James Comey recommended that Clinton not be charged in the matter. “Consistent with our commitment to transparency with respect to the FBI’s investigation of former Secretary of State Clinton’s use of a personal email server, the FBI is providing certain relevant materials to appropriate congressional committees to assist them in their oversight responsibilities in this matter,'' the FBI said in a statement Tuesday. The likelihood that we'll see any of the documents is extremely low -- they're all classified as secret -- but Republicans hope the documents will reveal sufficient ground to call for a new investigation by the Justice Department. Specifically, they're saying Clinton's testimony at the Benghazi hearings last October is at odds with the FBI's findings. Among critics of the move is Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), who says there's "little legitimate purpose" to the document handover, and fears that classified information will be leaked for political purposes. Making the voting pie higher More people are Googling "voter registration" this year than in 2012, according to Google. (Either that, or more people are Googling "voltron theme song lyrics" and getting sidetracked by Google autocomplete.) Data shows that nearly all states with a 200%-plus increase are blue states -- California, New York, Vermont, Maine and Massachusetts -- with West Virginia as the only red state. However, the data doesn't indicate which party is drawing interest from Google users. (Plus, our state-by-state winner-take-all system pretty much renders your presidential votes moot. Sorry, guys.) More significantly, searches on voter registration information is up more than 100% since the last election in six battleground states: Pennsylvania, Ohio, Iowa, New Hampshire, Virginia and Colorado. The GOP, meanwhile, is working to drum up Hispanic support for Trump. Hey, quit laughing; Hispanics still support Trump in similar numbers to Mitt Romney at this point in 2012 (which is to say, in the low 20s). The first video of the social media campaign features RNC Director of Hispanic Communications Helen Aguirre Ferré criticizing the Obama administration's foreign policy -- and notably not mentioning Trump until the final 12 seconds of the video.

Google Duo, the video calling app that was launched yesterday for Android and iOS, seems to be taking the world by storm today. When we tried it out today, Duo seems to be easy-to-use, as it needs only a phone number for registration. One day Google will unite all their messaging services into a single one… But not today. So we get Allo Duo Hangouts Google Voice Messenger— Marques Brownlee (@MKBHD) August 16, 2016 Google Duo now available on Android and iOS. Only difference is that the iOS version doesn’t have ‘vibrate while ringing’ option.— Samir Makwana (@shadez) August 17, 2016 I'm impressed with Google Duo. It has one job and does it well. Quality was surprisingly good.— Michael Ingram Jr (@mingramjr) August 17, 2016 Duo by @google is awesome. I am sure #Allo will be too!

Just add group calls to it and Skype will be a thing of the past.— Sharad (@Marwaari) August 17, 2016 The Google Duo experience is far better on Android than on iOS. And this is as a result of limitations imposed by iOS.— V. Ganesh (@vganesh) August 17, 2016 The app seems to be user-friendly. Its unique 'Knock Knock' feature gives a video preview of the caller even before you pick it up. The camera can be switched between front and back. When WiFi connection gets slower, the video gets paused, but comes back again when the connection gets better. It is the same with 2G and 3G connections. A slower 2G connection doesn't seem to be feasible for usage. But the best part about the app is the simple interface, that can be used by people with different devices. On a lighter note, there were tweets from users who went on to mock Google Hangouts comparing it to Duo.

Google originally introduced us to Duo at Google I/O with the idea that it would make video chat as simple as it could be, and it does, however, most video calling apps also feature the ability to make voice calls. Right now Duo does not, but it will soon. According to Amit Fulay, Google’s product lead for communication, audio-only calls are coming to Duo “soon,” granted that could mean literally at any point in time. While it makes sense to include the feature in a video calling app, it makes no sense to me considering the way Duo works. Since the app is already tied to your phone number, it seems a bit pointless to also have voice calls through Duo. The only situation I can see where this would be useful is if you’re in an area with sketchy cellular coverage but strong Wi-Fi. That said, the functionality is coming soon. It could be useful, it might not be. For the time being, Duo is available now for download on Android and iOS.

This back-to-school season, Google deserves an A+ for its updates to Google Classroom and its growing library of Google Expeditions.  ( Google ) Advertisement Google is making life easier for students, teachers and parents this back-to-school season with a few updates to Google Classroom and Expeditions — updates that deserve an A+. In June, Tech Times reported some new Google for Education tools to help empower educators and inspire learning in students. This month, Google is taking education "beyond classroom walls" and going mobile, allowing everyone to access (and doodle on!) learning materials, go on exciting adventures, and stay on top of class requirements through email notifications. Here are the nifty updates to Google Classroom and the exciting new adventures on Google Expeditions. 1. Google Classroom Email Summaries A new feature in Google Classroom will now enable parents or guardians to keep track of a child's homework and other class activities through online summaries. Teachers can invite the parent or guardian to receive weekly or daily updates on what is going on in school, turning each class into its own online community where parents can participate actively. From posting test results to announcing homework and other school projects, the email summaries will not only keep students in the loop but will also involve parents in the overall monitoring of their child's performance. These Google Classroom summaries go hand in hand with the most recent update to Inbox by Gmail, which now groups together important notifications into smart clusters for easy tracking. 2. Google Classroom Whiteboard And Annotation Tool Students sometimes learn better, and express themselves more clearly, when writing things down in longhand or scribbling down diagrams and formulae in freehand. One study shows that writing ideas down with a pen and paper allows students to process information in their own words. Today, students and teachers can make good use of this age-old learning technique of jotting down ideas fast (instead of simply typing up notes) thanks to Google Classroom's new annotation tool. This doodle functionality lets students answer questions in freehand, and highlight important text in different colors. (Photo : Google) "Using annotations, students can complete assignments, sketch out math problems or even create visuals of creative ideas directly on their devices," write Dina Kachintseva and Felix Wang of Google. Kachintseva is a software engineer for Classroom while Wang is a user experience designer. With their teams, they have given students a "portable classroom whiteboard" to sketch and write notes on, whether the students are at home, in class or even on the school bus. 3. Beyond The Classroom: Google Expeditions Apart from refreshing the Google Classroom app, Google is making sure classroom learning is deeply immersive, vivid and memorable with Google Expeditions. Equipped with the Google Cardboard, students can now go on field trips to almost any corner of the planet through the virtual reality / augmented reality-based Google Expeditions program. With more than 200 adventures on offer, a class simply dons the Cardboard headset and embarks on these VR/AR field trips "from Machu Picchu to Antarctica to the International Space Station" and even inside the human body.

They elect husbands, wives, sons, and daughters. The First Family poses for an official portrait in the Oval Office in December of 2011. Pete Souza / The White House Most Popular 'Hail Trump!': White Nationalists Salute the President Elect Daniel Lombroso and Yoni Appelbaum Nov 21, 2016 The Running Conversation in Your Head Julie Beck 7:00 AM ET The Electoral College Was Meant to Stop Men Like Trump From Being President Peter Beinart Nov 21, 2016 What’s So Great About American World Leadership? Hugh White 10:41 AM ET Donald Trump's Conflicts of Interest: A Crib Sheet Jeremy Venook 7:00 AM ET Megan Garber Aug 12, 2016 Politics Share Tweet … LinkedIn Email Print Text Size There is an argument that arises, presidential campaign after presidential campaign, in forms ranging from the sarcastic to the strident. It goes like this: Maybe the U.S. should have a prime minister. Maybe the U.S. should even have a king or queen. Maybe the presidency should be neatly bifurcated, the governmental duties on one side and the ceremonial on the other: a constitutional monarchy, basically, only without the crowns or the thrones or the subtle side-eye from the ghost of George Washington. The argument recurs, chafing though it may against most Americans’ conception of what their country is all about, because it is grounded in a broad truth: Americans ask a lot of their leaders. The presidency, at this point—an office that has been celebritized through the decades by the workings of mass media—is at once martial and executive and administrative and ceremonial. It demands that the person who carries the nuclear codes be the same person who pardons the turkeys. Exercising international diplomacy, throwing dinners, waging war, making memes, delivering soaring speeches, indulging in small talk on The Late Show, inspiring us, amusing us, consoling us, keeping us safe: All of these fall under the presidency’s ever-expanding job description. That makes the job an all-consuming endeavor—and it means that, regardless of his (and now, potentially, her) gender, the president has come to function as a kind of national host. If the country is an imagined community, the president is the person charged with welcoming Americans, day after day, into the national family. Triumphs and trials of women in leadership Read more That is perhaps why Americans have been, historically, so interested in politicians’ own, decidedly non-imaginary, families. Google recently provided The Atlantic with a selection of search data: a corpus of the terms associated with various politicians, across presidential, Senate, and House races. The idea was to give a proximate sense, via U.S. searches related to each person’s candidacy, of what people wanted to know about their would-be leaders. And one of the most common trends, across candidates and campaign years—and also across genders—was the searchers’ consistent interest in candidates’ families. The Google corpus suggests the same thing those periodic proposals of American monarchy do: American voters don’t simply put people into office. They put families there. * * * Let’s start with the 2016 presidential primary season (for Google-search purposes, the period of April of 2015 to March of 2016). The top 50 searches related to Marco Rubio include “marco rubio wife,” which came in as the fourth-most common related search. That was followed by “jeanette rubio” (16th) and “rubio wife” (32nd). Carly Fiorina’s related searches include “frank fiorina” (16th) and “carly fiorina husband” (27th). For Hillary Clinton, from January 2015 to the present, “bill clinton” has been the candidate’s 9th most common related search term—more popular than “hillary clinton vp,” “hillary clinton email,” and “hillary clinton benghazi.” Those spouse-specific searches echo the dynamics of the 2012 presidential campaign, in which Mitt Romney’s 21st most common search term was “ann romney,” with “mitt romney wife” coming in as the 47th. And that, in turn, echoed the dynamics of 2008. In that campaign, with its long and hard-fought primary season, Joe Biden’s most common related search terms included “joe biden wife” (11th) and “jill biden” (31st). Michele Bachmann’s popular terms included “michele bachmann husband” (4th), “marcus bachman” (18th), and “bachmann husband” (37th). Sarah Palin’s included “sarah palin affair” (31st)—ostensibly the public’s expression of curiosity about this—and “todd palin” (30th). The searches suggest a culturally holistic notion of political leadership: It takes a village to lead a country. Some of those searches, sure, might suggest simple prurience (“sarah palin affair”) on the part of the Americans who took to Google to convert curiosity into information. And there are reasons Bill’s name popped up in Hillary’s searches that have very little to do with voters’ attempts to assess the kind of president she would be. What’s most striking about the data, though, is the extent to which the spouse-related searches are made in relation to both men and women candidates. Rather than the regressive, if still common, framing of a woman’s achievements in terms of her husband—“good job, Carly, but what about Frank?”—the data suggest, overall, the public’s broader interest in candidates’ families, regardless of the candidates’ gender. So the searches in this case don’t necessarily suggest sexism. (Although “Hillary clinton nutcracker” is currently the Democratic nominee’s 35th-most common related-search term.) Rather, they suggest a culturally holistic notion of political leadership. It takes a village to lead a country. The Google data further dispel the idea of straightforward gender bias when it comes to searches surrounding recent congressional races. On the one hand, “mia love husband” and “jason love” come in at the Utah representative’s 3rd and 5th most-common related searches, respectively, and “steve schultz” is the number-one related search term for Florida’s Debbie Wasserman Schultz. But for many of those politicians’ fellow women, among them Senators Elizabeth Warren and Claire McCaskill and former Representative Gabby Giffords, their top 50 related searches feature no mention at all of husbands or spouses. (That is particularly surprising when it comes to Giffords, whose husband is the famous-in-his-own-right astronaut Mark Kelly. His absence among her searches could be attributed to people simply not realizing that they’re married—and, either way, that they have other things they want to know about her besides her marital status. Americans are not searching, in great numbers, for “gabby giffords husband.”) Curiosity about “family,” in particular, was a cross-gender phenomenon in the Google searches. In 2008, “joe biden family” was the then-primary candidate’s 17th most common search term; “Marco rubio family” was, during the Florida senator’s 2016 presidential run, his 24th most common related term. And children, too, have been common causes for curiosity, for both women and men candidates. “Bristol palin” was Sarah Palin’s second-most-common related search in 2008; “trig palin” was the 23rd, “sarah palin daughter” was the 27th, and “palin daughter” was the 39th. In 2012, “mitt romney sons” was the GOP nominee’s 24th most common search term. And in 2016, “carly fiorina daughter” was the GOP primary contender’s 10th-most-common related search during her run. “Lori ann fiorina”—the candidate’s stepdaughter, who died of a drug overdose in 2009 after a long battle with addiction—was the 20th, and “carly fiorina children” was the 31st. * * * Together, the data suggest what any political convention, and what a lot of political media coverage, will tend to take for granted: Politics is, whatever else it might be, a family game. That’s the reason candidates air TV ads that prominently highlight their loving husbands or wives or children. It’s the reason that Michelle Obama and Ivanka Trump stole the shows in Philadelphia and Cleveland last month. It’s the reason that executives at the state and national levels have come to office, carrying on a centuries-long tradition, with “first families” in tow. The New York Times recently mentioned, in an article about Bill Clinton’s plans for his potential foray into first gentlemanship, that the former president would not be engaging in activities like picking out White House china patterns and overseeing floral arrangements. Instead, the paper noted, some of those duties are “expected to fall to the Clintons’ daughter, Chelsea.” Dynasties, familial intrigue, tabloid fodder—politicians can provide those things. Americans want them to. This, rightfully, provoked ire. (Perhaps the Clinton White House could make things easier on everyone and just get Colin Cowie on retainer.) And yet, in the context of the family impulse in American politics, the turn-to-Chelsea assumption made some sense. The White House is, on top of everything else, a home; the first families is expected to shoulder the burdens of making that home. It’s a duty that reflects the president’s role not just as a political leader, but as a cultural one. The current president recently wrote an impassioned defense of feminism in the pages of Glamour. His wife recently starred, with Missy Elliott, in a Carpool Karaoke segment. The Obama daughters make headlines for everything from yawning to wearing clothing to talking to Ryan Reynolds to getting a summer job at a seafood shack. Which is another way of saying that Americans seem to sense the soft scent of royalty in first families—while never, of course, admitting to a taste for monarchy. Dynasties, familial intrigue, fodder for tabloids: Politicians can provide those things. Recent history would suggest that Americans want them to. Take the Google search data for President Obama: the commander in chief of the most powerful military in the world, the man who makes decisions every day that directly affect the course of millions of human lives. Google’s most common related-search term for the president between January 2015 and today? “Malia obama.” The third most common, after “president obama”? “Sasha obama.” And then “michelle obama” (14th). And then “obama daughters” (16th). And then “malia obama college” (21st). At the moment, the 49th most common search term related to the 44th president of the United States is “natasha obama,” his youngest daughters given name. So deep, apparently, is the American public’s interest in the first family that some industrious Google searchers use a name not even the Obamas employ.

Spencer saluted more than 200 attendees on Saturday, gathered at the Ronald Reagan Building in Washington, D.C., for the annual conference of the National Policy Institute, which describes itself as “an independent organization dedicated to the heritage, identity, and future of  people of European descent in the United States, and around the world.” Spencer has popularized the term “alt-right” to describe the movement he leads. Spencer has said his dream is “a new society, an ethno-state that would be a gathering point for all Europeans,” and has called for “peaceful ethnic cleansing.” For most of the day, a parade of speakers discussed their ideology in relatively anodyne terms, putting a presentable face on their agenda. But after dinner, when most journalists had already departed, Spencer rose and delivered a speech to his followers dripping with anti-Semitism, and leaving no doubt as to what he actually seeks. He referred to the mainstream media as “Lügenpresse,” a term he said he was borrowing from “the original German”; the Nazis used the word to attack their critics in the press. Continue Reading Frederick Carl Frieseke / Wikimedia The Running Conversation in Your Head Julie Beck What a close study of "inner speech" reveals about why humans talk to themselves Language is the hallmark of humanity—it allows us to form deep relationships and complex societies. But we also use it when we’re all alone; it shapes even our silent relationships with ourselves. In his book, The Voices Within, Charles Fernyhough gives a historical overview of “inner speech”—the more scientific term for “talking to yourself in your head.” Fernyhough, a professor at Durham University in the U.K., says that inner speech develops alongside social speech. This idea was pioneered by Lev Vygotsky, a Russian psychologist who studied children in the 1920s and noted that when they learned to talk to other humans, they also learned how to talk to themselves, first out loud, and eventually, in their heads.

Americans talk about democracy like it’s sacred. In public discourse, the more democratic American government is, the better. The people are supposed to rule. But that’s not the premise that underlies America’s political system. Most of the men who founded the United States feared unfettered majority rule. James Madison wrote in Federalist 10 that systems of government based upon “pure democracy … have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property.” John Adams wrote in 1814 that, “Democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts and murders itself.” The framers constructed a system that had democratic features. The people had a voice. They could, for instance, directly elect members of the House of Representatives. But the founders also self-consciously limited the people’s voice. Continue Reading Yamada Taro / Getty What’s So Great About American World Leadership? Hugh White The U.S. voters who rejected decades of bipartisan foreign-policy consensus might be on to something. How has America come to elect a president who so starkly repudiated decades’ worth of the largely bipartisan vision of U.S. global leadership? And if that vision won’t be the basis of American foreign policy in the 21st century, what will replace it? The big message of 2016 is that large numbers of American voters, Democrat and Republican, do not buy what their political leaders have been selling for so long, and that includes foreign policy. The evidence of this from Trump’s victory is reinforced by Senator Bernie Sanders’ remarkable showing in the Democratic primaries, and by years’ worth of public-opinion surveys showing the widespread view that the United States “does too much in helping solve world problems.” It is also reinforced by the high poll numbers of an outgoing president who has mounted his own quiet campaign against key elements of Washington’s foreign-policy orthodoxy. Continue Reading Carlo Allegri / Reuters Donald Trump's Conflicts of Interest: A Crib Sheet Jeremy Venook A semi-comprehensive list of the business concerns that may influence the president-elect as he prepares for the nation’s highest office Though several previous presidents have entered office with private fortunes to their names, none has done so with a business empire nearly as large or complicated as that of President-elect Donald J. Trump. Estimates of Trump’s wealth vary substantially: While he self-reports a net worth of $10 billion, independent agencies have arrived at valuation generally between $3 billion and $5 billion. The unprecedented nature of Trump’s business interests, coupled with the many precedents that Trump broke throughout his campaign—not releasing his tax returns, for example, which severely limits attempts to understand his financial situation—has provoked speculation that his presidency may bring about equally unprecedented opportunities for conflicts of interest. Trump’s response—provided on Twitter—only reinforces concerns that he will make little effort to avoid entangling his business and personal interests, and will instead attack those who point that out.

Here’s why the race between Governor Pat McCrory and Democrat Roy Cooper isn’t over yet. DURHAM, N.C.—It’s been two weeks since Election Day, which means that in 49 states, residents know who their governor will be next year. North Carolinians, however, are still waiting to see. At the end of balloting on November 8, Democrat Roy Cooper, the current state attorney general, had a lead of a few thousand votes over Governor Pat McCrory, a Republican. Cooper promptly declared victory, but McCrory has not conceded the race, and the state has not been able to declare a winner. On Monday, Cooper announced a transition team, while McCrory accused him of “circumventing the electoral process.” Cooper’s lead fluctuated throughout the day on Tuesday as more counties returned their final canvass, but as of writing it was a little more than 6,000 votes out of roughly 4,700,000. (The most up-to-date results are here.) Continue Reading Carolyn Kaster / AP The Trump Takeover The Editors After a shocking upset, the president-elect and his party prepare for next year.

Every day in June, the most popular wedding month of the year, about 13,000 American couples will say “I do,” committing to a lifelong relationship that will be full of friendship, joy, and love that will carry them forward to their final days on this earth. Except, of course, it doesn’t work out that way for most people. The majority of marriages fail, either ending in divorce and separation or devolving into bitterness and dysfunction. Of all the people who get married, only three in ten remain in healthy, happy marriages, as psychologist Ty Tashiro points out in his book The Science of Happily Ever After, which was published earlier this year. Social scientists first started studying marriages by observing them in action in the 1970s in response to a crisis: Married couples were divorcing at unprecedented rates. Worried about the impact these divorces would have on the children of the broken marriages, psychologists decided to cast their scientific net on couples, bringing them into the lab to observe them and determine what the ingredients of a healthy, lasting relationship were. Was each unhappy family unhappy in its own way, as Tolstoy claimed, or did the miserable marriages all share something toxic in common? Continue Reading Etienne Fabre / SSAC A Shocking Find In a Neanderthal Cave In France Ed Yong A rock structure, built deep underground, is one of the earliest hominin constructions ever found. In February 1990, thanks to a 15-year-old boy named Bruno Kowalsczewski, footsteps echoed through the chambers of Bruniquel Cave for the first time in tens of thousands of years. The cave sits in France’s scenic Aveyron Valley, but its entrance had long been sealed by an ancient rockslide. Kowalsczewski’s father had detected faint wisps of air emerging from the scree, and the boy spent three years clearing away the rubble. He eventually dug out a tight, thirty-meter-long passage that the thinnest members of the local caving club could squeeze through. They found themselves in a large, roomy corridor. There were animal bones and signs of bear activity, but nothing recent. The floor was pockmarked with pools of water. The walls were punctuated by stalactites (the ones that hang down) and stalagmites (the ones that stick up). Continue Reading Mike Segar / Reuters 'An Erosion of Democratic Norms in America' Clare Foran The president-elect is testing the limits of political convention. In the aftermath of the presidential election, Donald Trump has publicly criticized protesters and “the crooked media.” He appears unconcerned with past precedent as he interacts with foreign leaders, and has dismissed concerns that he may face potential conflicts of interest as president. The president-elect is already testing the limits of political convention. Should that be a cause for concern? During the primary election, Dartmouth College political scientist Brendan Nyhan described Trump’s rise as a candidate willing to endorse violence against political opponents as a failure of American institutions to safeguard political norms. Following the election, he has warned that institutions and elites have continued to tolerate illiberal behavior.

Alphabet's lead exec behind Google's self-driving car project announced earlier this month he was stepping down from the important project. In this video, The Motley Fool's Dylan Lewis and Daniel Sparks discuss the surprising move. Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Aug 17, 2016 at 10:06PM Chris Urmson recently announced that he was leaving Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)(NASDAQ:GOOG) and its self-driving car project behind. In this clip from Industry Focus: Tech, Motley Fool analysts Dylan Lewis and Daniel Sparks look at what Urmson himself had to say about his departure (and where you can find his statement), and speculate on what may have led him to say goodbye to the project. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Aug. 12, 2016. Dylan Lewis: In a post on Medium, Chris Urmson, who is the director of Google's self-driving car project, announced that he was leaving the project and the company. In that post he said, "After leading our cars through the human equivalent of a 150 years of driving and helping our project make the leap from pure research to developing a product that we hope someday anyone can be able to use, I'm ready for a fresh challenge." He went on to say, "If I can find another project that turns into an obsession and become something more, I will consider myself twice lucky." If you're interested in reading the whole post, the title is, "The view from the front seat of the Google self driving car, a new chapter," that's over on Medium. This was pretty surprising to me. This is someone that was involved in the self-driving car project pretty much from day 1 at Google. His prior research was in autonomous driving. He was in the early DARPA competitions for these, let's try to get something out there self-driving car projects that eventually materialized into what Google's working on now. That has kind of been his life for the last decade. He's basically running a team that he's been working with for a very long time there. I was shocked by this news. Daniel Sparks: Yeah. You have to wonder if it has something to do with the balance that Google takes on with its self driving cars, between operating as, "Okay, this is the technology and we're going to stick with developing a technology and outsourcing it to other businesses," or if they're thinking more toward the line, maybe not talking about it publicly, but doing something internally as a business with this technology. Maybe this has something to do with balancing between those lines, whether they're going to outsource the technology or do something internally. They recently transitioned to Alphabet, so yeah, it makes you wonder why he's leaving and what could have caused that. Lewis: Yeah, and I think one of the interesting things here is as much as I've been paying attention at least, pretty much everything I've heard about Google's self-driving car project has come from Urmson himself. He's been the one providing updates, he's been the one offering up the vision on what's going on there. I was at South by Southwest earlier this year and saw him speak, he was one of the keynotes. He talked about this idea of, "We want to create the tech that powers this and allows for these types of systems to be mainstream. We're not interested in manufacturing cars ourselves, we're going to partner up with some of the legacy auto manufacturers to make that happen." That has been the company line for quite some time now. You see, last year, the company hired John Krafcik, who is former president and CEO of Hyundai America, and they brought on to be the chief of the car project, so more of a business role, with Urmson leading the tech side of things. I think part of the plan there was to spin out this effort that they're working on in self-driving cars into some sort of stand-alone business, whether it's auto manufacturing, whether it's providing this tech, maybe licensing it out to the auto manufacturers. You wonder if that move might have caused some ripples within the development of the project, and might have caused Urmson to want to go elsewhere.

Android 7.0 Nougat reviews: Should you upgrade your device? Opera pulls trigger on baked-in ad blocker Video Hands-On with the Galaxy S6 Edge+ Android malware and Google Adsense Google’s Adsense advertising program is used by many sites across the Internet. But Android users should beware of some nasty malware that is being spread by Google’s Adsense network. Justin Luna reports for Neowin: Mikhail Kuzin and Nikita Buchka of Kaspersky Solutions found the banking Trojan, which was dubbed ‘Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Svpeng.q.’ The malware is out to steal banking and other financial information from innocent people on the internet, by means of phishing or other related methods. It also has the ability to read and delete text messages sent by banks to their clients. It was found that the malware can actually be contracted via AdSense, Google’s own advertising network. What is also very alarming is that millions of websites on the internet, from news sites, to the smallest blog websites utilize the network, in order to monetize their content. Moreover, Svpeng is downloaded automatically as soon as the page with the advertisement is visited. The Kaspersky researchers found the malware on state-owned news company Russia Today (RT), as well as the Meduza news portal. In light of the discovery, the latter has already disabled AdSense advertising on their pages. Svpeng will disguise itself as a browser update, shown on the screenshot, in order to trick users into thinking that the download is safe. Once installed, the malware disappears from the list of installed apps, and then it will request administrator rights. This privilege will make it harder for antivirus to terminate the malicious program. More at Neowin News about the spread of Android malware via Google Adsense drew some sharp responses from Neowin readers: Max Norris: “Yup, you want an ad blocker on your phone too. It’s not just a nuisance thing anymore, it’s part of your security suite.” Felrefordit: “You couldn’t be any more wrong. Only a moron would trust his ad blocker to protect him from malware of any kind. Why? Because ads can only infect your computer or phone the very same way any web page can. You know, web pages like the ones you block the ads on. On the other side ad servers like AdSense’s about 1000x more secured than Average Joe’s webpage.” Mrbester: “You couldn’t be more wrong yourself. Websites don’t tend to serve ads themselves; the ad servers do. If AdSense is serving up the malware then it isn’t the website doing it. Plus the antivirus offerings on mobile are a joke, consuming massive resources of CPU, battery and bandwidth. I’ll use an ad blocker as much as I like, thanks. I’m not about to take advice from a clueless “ohh, the poor sites won’t get revenue” idiot.” DeusProto: “Thank goodness for AdGuard for Android (which also blocks ads in programs). If advertisers REALLY wanted to put an end to malvertising they would only allow standard format images and text. No JS, no Java, no Silverlight, no Flash, and so on. If they want to reduce the impact from ad blocking then they would do what I mentioned above. Until they do, they have nobody to blame but themselves for the prevalence of ad blocking. It is bad end user security not to use an ad blocker these days. They also made their beds before malvertising was a thing. Pop ups, pop unders, ads with annoying and loud noises, ads that prevent closure of the window, and other such “in your face” gradually increasing annoyance levels leading up to the creation of Proxomitron and the other extremely early ad blockers so that end users could put a stop to it. They took too many liberties. And now they expect end users to compromise their security. They should not have progressed past the point of simply displaying a static image. I’ve been using the internet since 1994 so I’ve seen how it has gotten worse year by year before the rise of ad blocking. It started out as either non-intrusive text ads, or ONE rectangular ad at the top of a webpage that were rarey animated, and were completely non-intrusive, and it devolved from there as they got progressively more greedy.” CougarDan: “ This is why if providers like Google and Facebook want to force-upload data to our devices they should have some legal culpability in the content that comes from their servers. If I elect to browse a specific site that’s fine, that’s my choice/responsibility, but when I’m being served invisible data in the background that’s well beyond my control. Even worse when it comes to Facebook they’re actually trying (HA!) to circumnavigate the ability to block the content so now when (and it is most definitely a ‘when’) they get hijacked the malware will get to go straight through. ” Coth: “AdSense has been one of largest malware spreading networks for ages. Google never cared about it.” Draconian Guppy: “Man this has been happening for years! (I know cause I clicked… mistakenly ) Hopefully google do something about it.” Packet1009: “Bravo Android, you depthless cesspool. I’ve actually gone the other way - I only trust my iOS devices (phone, pad) for online banking instead of using a PC/laptop” Seeprime: “I’ve been using Opera Mini with its built in ad-blocker turned on. It’s much faster than Ad-Block browser. Google’s lack of screening of ads is unfortunate. Android can be made to be pretty safe without sideloading and push SMS turned off. Ads, however, are more than a mere annoyance now. Stop them however you can to prevent issues.” More at Neowin Security features in Android 7.0 Speaking of Android, Google has shared some details about security features in the next version of its mobile operating system Android 7.0 (Nougat). Al Sacco reports for CIO: During an hour-long Hangouts web chat for the media and select IT professionals, Google today provided a glimpse of some of the new security features in its upcoming mobile OS, Android 7.0 “Nougat,” which should be available on Google Nexus devices “in a few weeks,” according to the company. The online briefing wasn’t meant to be exhaustive. Instead, it provided a top-level look at a set of new security and management tools in Android Nougat and Android for Work. Here’s a breakdown of some of the most notable security improvements in Nougat, for Android users and IT administrators. 1. Direct boot and stronger encryption 2. Stronger MediaServer and platform hardening 3. App security and abuse prevention 4. Seamless’ Android updates When Nougat software updates are available for new phones, users can choose to download and install them in a separate on-device partition, so they don’t need to stop using their phones or tablets during the process. The next time they reboot their phones, the new software will auto-install much more quickly than in the past, according to the company. Unfortunately, only new phones optimized for Nougat will have access to this feature. More at CIO Android users share their thoughts about Duo Google’s new video calling app Duo is getting quite a bit of attention in the media and in online discussions. A recent thread in the Android subreddit captured some of the sentiment about Duo from Android users: Aamir64: “I’m really liking the fact that Android users can now be able to use video amongst other Android users and iOS users. Video quality is good and consistent. That’s what I really like about this app, the consistency. Knock knock feature is genius and it really removes mystery of the caller and seemlessly transitions into an actual conversation. I’ve used the app with my wife and brother in law and we all share the same experience. I’m not sure why people are complaining about this app right out of the gate, but this app is simple and provides a consistent video calling experience. This is what Google needed i think. Now Android users have their version of Facetime. Hangouts was ok, but inconsistent, perhaps that’s why it didnt catch on. I’m really enjoying this app.” Curious Iguana: “I have Duo. No one else I know has Duo or is ever likely to install Duo.” And1927: “I have about 100 contacts and every single one of them uses WhatsApp (half of them are on iOS). No one uses SMS/MMS here in the UK, especially MMS since it’s not included in most packages. As for video calling, I guess it’s more common among friends and relatives that live far and don’t see each others often. I never video call so Duo is useless to me.” DiviRan: “Just make it a default app that comes with Nougat but give users the ability to uninstall if they don’t like it. That will give the app the publicity it needs for a good start.” Armandorod: “I was reading some users saying it was grainy but not on my tests, on 3G and not grainy at all almost perfect sharp video.” DinoStak: “Not gonna lie, I was on the hate train but after using it I love it. I hope the user base grows enough.” Joejoejoemoe: “Not complaining, I think it’s a cool app. But, there’s no way I can convince people to step away from what they already know, among my social circle anyways, Facebook messenger. At this moment, you can make calls, send messages, send texts, video call, leave voice messages, and send payments. The development team for this app has been killing the unification on this platform. Duo’s nice, but splitting their assets into a million apps when I already have one that does it all so well?” Hbar98: “Just continuing the conversation. I’m not disagreeing with you, but maybe Google has an idea with how they are doing this. While with FB Messenger you don’t need a FB account (I believe), you still have to sign up with the big blue f, and that is a turn-off for some. With Duo, all you need is a windows or iOS phone. You don’t need to sign up with anyone, you don’t need to remember your password, you don’t even need to make a username. You use your phone number, and the app takes care of identifying you. And remember… someone had to convince your friends that FB Messenger was better than the alternative, so your friends can step away from things they already knew. If Duo turns out to be good (superior call quality, end-to-end encryption), easy (no account creation needed, no seen attachment to Google, FB, etc…), and behaves the same across platforms (I can help my iOS friends with the app in the same way I can help my Android friends), then I can see some people moving over. Not all, but maybe many.” DeadSalas: “The real question is if the user base will ever get high enough for it to be valuable. I don’t know about you guys, but getting people I know to download an app that they’d only use to contact me because no one else they know uses it is basically impossible.” Hughman: “Exactly! Convincing my closest family to jump from Facetime to Duo just ain’t going to happen. I tried with Hangouts and it took years of convincing. To now tell them that Hangouts didn’t work out after all, Duo is the new thing, all I’m going to get is “I’ll rather stick with Facetime, at least it’s consistent” Ask yourself “will an iPhone using mom pick this up?”. If the answer is “no”, then it will have a hard to reach a mayor crowd.” More at Reddit Did you miss a roundup?

Thank you for supporting the partners who make SitePoint possible. More from this author SEO Bootcamp for Beginners How to Run an SEO Test in 5 Steps 7 Steps to Write Content that Converts If you’re optimizing your site to rank higher in search engines like Google and Bing, you’re doing so to ultimately drive more visitors to your website. The very foundation of any digital marketing campaign, organic or pay-per-click (PPC), is the keyword. No matter how many algorithm updates search engines throw at you, the need to find the right keywords for sight has remained constant. And in order to find the right keywords, you need to do your keyword research. What’s keyword research? It’s the process in which marketers find the keywords people are actually using to search the web, to create a list of keywords to target in order to rank in search results. It’s got three basic parts: Discovery Refine Competitor Research In this piece we’ll go over the three parts of keyword research, explaining what each of them entails. We’ll also be providing some tips and keyword research tools to help you along the way. Keyword discovery List of seed keywords The very first step in the keyword research process is to come up with a very broad, general list of keywords for your site. These aren’t necessarily the actual keywords you’ll end up targeting on your site — think of them more as answers to the question “what is my site about?” If you’re a blogger, or doing keyword research for your company’s blog, these are likely to be the subjects that you post about the most. If you’re doing SEO for your business’ page, think about your buyer profiles. What sort of topics would your target want to know more about? Check your analytics and Google Search Console account to see how people are currently finding your site, and which keywords are driving the most conversion. If your business is, say, an SEO tool that targets digital marketers and small/medium businesses, for example, your topics could be “digital marketing tools,” “lead generation,” “SEO audit tool,” “SEO guide” and “keyword tracking.” If you have several categories on your website, think of each of these as a keyword topic. Expanding your list Once you’ve come up with your list of topics, usually between five and ten, it’s time to come up with a list of keywords for each. These are keywords you think that someone would actually type into a search engine to find your site. The point of this step isn’t to come up with every possibility under the sun, you just need to come up with starting points for further research. So for our SEO company, some keywords for the “SEO audit” topic could be: SEO website checker SEO website audit tool Best SEO website review tools Free website SEO Checker SEO Report Website review Technical audit SEO checklist There are a lot of tools you can use to expand your list of keywords at this point. Both Bing and Google have keyword research tools. Google has the AdWords Keyword Planner, while Bing has a keyword research tool in its Webmaster Tools. Both are technically designed for PPC keyword research, but they are both really useful for SEO. Use Keyword Planner’s adgroup ideas to get a list of related keywords. Keyword Planner requires you to sign up for a free AdWords account. Bing’s Keyword Research is accessible in Webmaster Tools, which you should have already signed up for. Google Suggest is another great source of potential target keywords. Fortunately, there are tools out there you can use that will get Google’s suggested keywords without you having to manually find every possibility. Ubersuggest will provide you with a list of related keywords using Google Suggest, based on your input keyword. You can expand your list by finding related keywords to Ubersuggest’s results. You can download your results as a .csv, which will come in handy later. Mergewords is another useful free tool. It doesn’t use Google data like Ubersuggest, but can be very useful in building your keyword list quickly. It works by creating every possible combination of keywords. So if you’ve got three keywords: “SEO website audit,” “best SEO audit tool” and “free website review,” Mergewords will put together 36 possible different ways to combine those terms. Select the results to copy and paste them into an Excel spreadsheet. Just be sure to go over your list from Mergewords to take out any that don’t make sense, like “SEO seo audit” and “SEO seo audit tool” in the example above. Narrow Your List So now that you’ve put some time and effort into coming up with a long list of keywords you want to target, it’s time to cut it down to size. To do this, you’ll need to determine how much traffic a keyword can bring in, how easy (or hard) it will be to rank for it, and what users expect to find when they use a keyword in a search query. If you have some extra time and budget lying around, you can run a small AdWords campaign to determine the value of a keyword. In AdWords, choose “exact match” for your keywords and send users to the relevant landing pages. Run the campaign until you’ve brought in a few hundred clicks. Divide the number of visitors by revenue generated to find the dollar value of each visitor brought in by the keyword. So, for example, your keyword “Free website SEO Checker” brought in 200 new visitors who generated $2000 in revenue, and 275 people clicked through from the ad for the keyword “SEO website audit tool” and spent $2400. The first keyword is worth $10 per person and the second is worth $8.72. Search volume Optimizing your website for a keyword won’t do you much good if no one is searching for that keyword. Fortunately, there are easy ways to find out which keywords on that long list you came up with drive enough traffic to be effective for your business. Use AdWords Keyword Planner and Bing’s Keyword Research tool to find average monthly search volume on those search engines. If you’re a WooRank subscriber who has run an Advanced Review, you can use SERP Checker to track search volume as well. If you’re already tracking keywords in SERP Checker, search volume will populate automatically after the tool updates the data. If you aren’t using the tool yet, add keywords as you would normally and SERP Checker will start displaying information within 24 hours. Explore Google Trends to see how popular a keyword is, and whether that interest is trending up or down. Change the lookback period to take advantage of shorter spikes of interest as well as long-term planning. You can add multiple search terms to determine which keywords would get your website the most visibility online. Note: The numbers in the interest over time graph do not represent the actual number of searches. They are representations of relative popularity compared to the most popular terms in the indicated time period and geography. Competitiveness/difficulty Total search volume isn’t all you should be looking at, though. A search term like “SEO” is going to see hundreds of thousands monthly searches (110,000 to be exact), but it’s such a broad term it’s going to be almost impossible to rank for it, unless you’re one of the really big players. A keyword like “seo analysis” has much lower estimated volume, but will be much easier to rank for, while a keyword like “free website seo checker” will be even easier. This last keyword is part of what’s known as a “long tail” keyword. Long tail keywords are searches that have low volume, maybe only a few dozen per month, but when combined make up 70% of all searches on Google. Long tail keywords are great because they’re easy to rank for and are much more likely to convert. To find the competitiveness/difficulty of a keyword open up Keyword Planner and Bing Webmaster Tools yet again. Keyword Planner uses CPC data, so it doesn’t translate directly into organic search metrics, but it’s generally close enough (and it’s free). Bing’s Keyword Research is strictly organic search data. When researching a keyword in Keyword Planner, look at the columns “Competition” and “Suggested bid”. Competition is pretty straightforward: it’s how many advertisers are bidding on that keyword. Suggested bid represents what you’d need to bid on a keyword, based on current CPCs of other advertisers, for your ad to display. Keywords that are highly competitive for CPC campaigns are usually highly competitive for organic search as well. Advertisers don’t target keywords unless there’s money to be made off of them. Search intent Determining the search intent of a keyword is an important part of deciding which keywords to target. If you’re an eCommerce site, you want to make sure your visitors are in the right frame of mind to be purchasing a product, while your blog is likely targeted to people earlier on in the conversion funnel. There are four basic types of keywords when it comes to intent: Informational keywords: These users are at the very beginning of the conversion funnel, and are the least likely to convert right away. However, you can’t afford to ignore them because they make up the majority of searches on Google. Informational keywords include words/phrases such as “how to”, “do I need”, “where to find”, etc. View these searchers as potential leads to convert later via your blog or email marketing. Product keywords: These searchers are a bit further along in the buying process, but still not all the way there. They’ve already decided they want or need to buy a product, but they just haven’t picked which one yet. They usually include things like “review,” “top 10,” “comparison,” “cheap” or specific brands, products or categories. Note: It might look like spam to you, but don’t worry about using terms like “cheap” in your keywords. They actually tend to convert very well. In-market keywords: These people are actively looking to buy something. They expect their search to take them directly to the product they want to purchase — they probably have their credit card on their keyboard at that moment. These keywords usually include terms like “deal”, “free shipping”, “discount”, “buy”, etc. These keywords typically have the lowest search volume but will make up for it with sky-high conversion rates. Freemium keywords: These keywords are used by searchers that are unlikely to convert in the near future. They’re generally looking for free tools or a way to get digital goods without paying for them. Avoid targeting these keywords unless you use a freemium model or some other way of monetizing traffic, as these people are unlikely to ever buy anything. It’s good to have a mix of each type of keyword in your strategy to capture potential customers at each stage of the purchase process and usher them through the conversion process. Once you know the search volume, competitiveness and intent of the keywords in your list, it’s time to start paring it down. Remove any keywords that don’t have enough volume or are too competitive to be worth targeting, or don’t have the right intent for your type of website. There isn’t really an ideal length for your keyword list — it depends on your site. Obviously, large, complex sites are going to have more target keywords than smaller, simpler ones. What’s really important is to have the right ones. Competitor Research After you’ve qualified your list to keywords that will add sufficient value, generate traffic and attract in-market searchers, it’s time to get a view of the competitive landscape. You don’t need to target every keyword your competitors use — they might have a slightly different audience than you, but it’s useful to know what keywords your competitors rank for and how they’re targeting those keywords. KeywordSpy is a free competitor research tool that’s really useful. You can do research for either a keyword or a domain, so you can get a really good view of what your competitors are up to, as well as how hard it will be for you to rank for your keywords. When doing keyword research, enter your target keyword and look at the Organic Competition tab to find the top 10 organic results. SpyFu is another free competitor research tool that you can use two different ways. The first is to enter the domain of a competitor you want to research. To see what keywords your competitor ranks for, click on Ranking History on the left. You’ll see the site’s top keywords and how it ranks for them. Enter your own domain to get useful information on who your competition is in the rankings, what keywords you compete over and which keywords they’re beating you on. Enter a keyword to see its ranking difficulty (out of a 100) and history. Check out the landing pages of the top results to see how they’ve optimized their pages for that keyword. Pay attention to title tags and the page content. Where and how are they using the keyword on the page? Final Thoughts There’s no real one size fits all solution for keyword research, unfortunately. The keywords that work best for one site might not be the optimal list for another in the same niche, which is why you need to do keyword research in the first place. What’s important here is that you’ve got a robust list of keywords that your target audience is using to search the web at all stages of your conversion funnel. Like the rest of SEO, keyword research is an ongoing process. Some marketers refresh their research every quarter, some do it more frequently than that. Don’t do it too often though, as it takes a while for your changes to take effect. You don’t want to hamstring your efforts by constantly targeting new keywords. What is your process for keyword research? What tools do you use? How often do you add/remove keywords from your list to target?

Read more about the stories in today's news: Shadow Brokers Allegedly Hack NSA's Equation Group Google Begins Development of Fuchsia Open-Source OS Salesforce Inbox to Include Calendar Feature for Smarter Scheduling Microsoft Shuttering Azure RemoteApp, Turns to Citrix       Today's topics include Shadow Broker's claim that it stole cyber-weapons stolen from the Equation Group, Google's new Fuchsia Open-Source operating system project, Salesforce's introduction of a new calendar feature for its Inbox app and Microsoft's partnership with Citrix to deliver the XenApp Express remote access application. On Aug. 13, a previously unknown group identifying itself only as the Shadow Brokers announced on Twitter that it was selling cyber-weapons it had allegedly stolen in a breach of a Equation Group server. The Equation Group is a shadowy group allegedly linked to the U.S National Security Agency, according to a 2015 report from security firm Kaspersky Lab. At this point, it's not entirely clear if there was a breach at the Equation Group or the NSA. Furthermore, neither the Equation Group nor the NSA is likely to make a public statement about its operations or whether they have been hit with a data breach. A spokesperson for Kaspersky Lab, which first publicized information about the Equation Group, told eWEEK that Kaspersky Lab doesn't have any information on the breach at this time, but the company's research team is investigating. Google has begun work on a brand-new open-source operating system called Fuchsia. From the few details that are publicly available about it on the GitHub code repository, Fuchsia will be completely different from Google's Android and Chrome operating systems. Fuchsia appears to be targeted at smartphones, high-end PCs featuring fast processors and large amounts of memory and internet of things devices. The biggest difference between Google's existing operating systems and Fuchsia is that the latter will not be based on the Linux kernel. It will instead use a new kernel called Magenta, which according to Google's description on GitHub, is the "core platform" powering the Fuchsia OS. Salesforce.com announced a significant new feature that it's added to its Inbox email app—a Calendar app that integrates with data stored on the company's CRM platform. The idea is to make sales reps more efficient, particularly on mobile devices, by giving them information on clients and prospects without having to launch a separate program. The news comes after an earlier Salesforce announcement about integration with Microsoft's popular Outlook email program. Salesforce Inbox is available for iOS and Android mobile devices. Azure RemoteApp, Microsoft's cloud-based remote application access service, is shutting down in 2017. Taking its place is a new collaboration between Microsoft and virtual desktop specialist Citrix called XenApp Express. The product, currently under development, "combines the simplicity of application remoting and the scalability of Azure with the security, management, and performance benefits of XenApp, to deliver Windows applications to any employee on any device," wrote Microsoft's Remote Desktop group in an Aug. 12 blog post. "We will have much more to share on this offering through the coming months." As a result, the company plans to shut down Azure RemoteApp in just over a year, on Aug. 31, 2017. Microsoft will stop taking orders for the service on Oct. 1.       Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

Ford Motor Co., aiming to put fully autonomous vehicles into the economy by 2021, announced that it’s doubling the size of its office in Silicon Valley to 260 people and investing in four companies that are key to building self-driving cars. The carmaker’s move follows more than US$1 billion (RM4 billion) in investments made by Detroit-based General Motors Co. in a pair of California technology companies earlier this year to keep up with Google’s autonomous-car project and Uber Technologies Inc.’s ride-hailing business. While the old-school mechanical engineering remains in the Midwest as does low-skilled factory work that hasn’t moved to Southern states, these investments show Detroit carmakers have realized that they must go to the nation’s technology centre to find the software expertise needed to make the autos of tomorrow. Traditional automakers now directly employ hundreds in Silicon Valley, which is also home to Palo Alto-based Tesla Motors Inc. “The shift to California is undeniable,” said Eric Noble, president of the CarLab consulting firm in Orange, California. “The technological development for autonomous vehicles and intelligent cars will continue to be done in Northern California because that’s where the knowledge is.” Tough realities Ford and GM, racing to stay among the technology leaders, face a few tough realities. Companies like Google and Uber threaten to upend the industry by turning car-owners and drivers into passengers who simply pay for a ride. And even though the carmakers and state of Michigan are developing tech talent, Silicon Valley is still ground zero for the people who write code, create driverless algorithms and come up with new business models for mobility. Ford has invested in Velodyne Lidar Inc., which develops the laser-based sensors that are the eyes of self-driving cars, and 3-D mapping company Civil Maps, both in California. The Dearborn, Michigan-based carmaker also acquired SAIPS, an Israeli-based computer vision and artificial intelligence designer, and it reached a licensing agreement with Nirenberg Neuroscience LLC. Its founder, Dr. Sheila Nirenberg, has developed a machine-vision platform that Ford said can bring humanlike intelligence to self-driving cars. “We came to Silicon Valley — there are a lot of great places around the world — but the ecosystem here is just unbelievable,” Fields, standing outside on a bright, sunny day, said to reporters. “It’s like a bazaar of ideas, and everybody’s open.” Smooth cruise GM CEO Mary Barra last year took her top leaders to visit tech companies and venture capital firms to get their thoughts on fostering innovation. GM went on to buy a 9 per cent stake in Lyft Inc., a competitor to Uber, for US$500 million. GM also spent more than that to buy San Francisco-based Cruise Automation, which writes the software for autonomous driving. Owning Cruise, which has grown from 40 employees to 100, has helped GM hire people who may not have been interested in working for an automaker, Mike Ableson, GM’s vice president of global product planning, said in a June interview. Some people want to remain the California environment but also have the stability of a large company, he said. Similarly, Ford’s announcement may have been intended to present the maker of F-150 pickups look like an “exciting destination for human talent,” Adam Jonas, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said in a research note. “There is at least a perception in the market that all the cool kids are going to places like Uber,” Google, Tesla or China, he wrote. Ford and other automakers “want to change this.” Michigan man Michigan isn’t giving up on talent, Governor Rick Snyder said in a June interview. Snyder, a former chairman of Gateway computers and founder of investment funds, pointed out that Alphabet Inc.’s Google announced in May that it will open a self-driving car research centre in suburban Detroit and that Harman International Industries Inc., the audio and automotive technology company, opened its North American headquarters nearby. Amazon.com Inc. has opened a tech centre in downtown Detroit. Snyder said one of Michigan’s biggest challenges is getting the word out that it has great resources for technology companies, especially in the automotive industry. With the University of Michigan focusing on software and technology development, the talent and education system is available for any company that wants to take advantage of it, he said. The university’s Mcity provides carmakers and tech companies with an ersatz town to test driverless cars. Plus the state has much lower costs of living and doing business than California, especially with real estate prices rising ever faster in Silicon Valley. “Our challenge is that we don’t do particularly well with telling people,” Snyder said. “That’s something we should do more of, especially when it comes to talking about Detroit’s comeback.” While the Detroit region has bounced back, its unemployment rate is 5.8 per cent compared with 4.1 per cent in the San Jose, California area, according to the Bureau of Labour Statistics. More marketing Snyder in June unveiled Planet M, an advertising and marketing campaign to tell technology companies that the state has the education and industrial base to be home to new automotive technology research and start-ups. The tagline is, “Michigan. Where big ideas in mobility are born.” To compete with the Golden State, Michigan plans to make an autonomous-drive test track out of a 330-acre industrial site near Ypsilanti, where Rosie the Riveter built B-24 bombers during World War II. One selling point: Tough winters and many potholes make the site a better proxy for the imperfect world of driving than California’s decommissioned Navy base in Concord. “If you look at any place in the world, we have highly developed building blocks,” Snyder said. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Chinese-made US$100b city in Johor 'scares the hell out of everybody' Merkel ‘not happy’ Trump scrapping Pacific trade deal Malaysia refrains from cutting interest rate as ringgit tumbles Cathay Pacific now accepts ringgit for inflight transactions Automakers seek to cut inventories with Black Friday, holiday promotions Chinese-made US$100b city in Johor 'scares the hell out of everybody' Foreign banks shaken by Malaysia's move to halt currency slide Malaysia’s central bank says will no longer tolerate ringgit trade in NDF market Ex-Valeant executive, ex-pharmacy CEO charged for fraud scheme Bank Negara Malaysia says it is intervening in currency market Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: China goes global as Trump puts America first Reuters Video: Antigua PM gives Prince Harry awkward honeymoon invite Kids and parents react to 'Beauty and the Beast' MMOTV: Mahathir, Siti Hasmah head to KLCC by car MMOTV: Red Shirts heckle yellow-shirted Bersih participants MMOTV: A Red Shirts supporter hurls abuse at Bersih supporters Related Articles Under pressure on US jobs, Ford tries new gambit with Trump Slowdown in labour force growth to have ‘major implications’ for Singapore Wall Street off as pound crashes, jobs data keeps Fed on track Jobs data to be a big deal for record-high stocks Swedes with big pay are snubbing aging labour market model Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services
