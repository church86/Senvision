Now the California-based company has updated the app with some really useful features that are likely to increase its utility manifold. The update is already available for download on App Store and Google Play. While the travel app was already able to fetch flight and hotel reservations from your Gmail inbox, it will now automatically organise all your past and upcoming train and bus (surface public transport) reservations in one place inside the Google Trips app alongside other reservations. With this update, Google has added a new feature to the app that allows users to stay up-to-date with their reservations even when they don't get confirmation on their mail. Users need to just press the '+' button in the bottom right corner within the reservations section and provide their airline and flight number, or the name of your hotel, car rental, or restaurant. The Google Trips app will then take care of the rest and will keep you updated with the changes even if they are not confirmed through mail. If you want to make free-form notes, the app will also allow that option to you. Notably, users will now also be able to share their travel information with other users with the help of the app. "Anyone you share with will receive an email with all the reservation details, and see them in the app too," the company said in its blog post. Google Trips allows users to download their trips in advance for offline use and with this feature, users can find nearby spots to see, check hours and locations for attractions, and review their saved places even when connectivity is a problem. "On average, nearly a quarter of Trips users are offline for more than seven hours at a time while travelling, and nearly 70 percent use the offline feature and download trips in advance," the search giant said. Additionally, the company has shared the eight destinations that saw a rise in popularity over the last year. The list includes Venice, Barcelona, Athens, Lisboa, Vancouver, Montreal, Santiago, and Denver.

Name: Subject: Message: Google Trips wants to make your summer vacation easier with new features Newsby John Callaham8 seconds ago We are now in the beginning of the prime vacation season, so there’s not a better time for an update to roll out for the Google Trips app, which first launched just a few months ago in September 2016. The company says the new version, which is rolling out from the Google Play Store this week, will add three new features. See also: Best travel apps for Android February 28, 2017 One of those new features in the app is the ability to see your hotel, flights and other travel information for your trip in one place, instead of opening multiple pages. This should help many people who might take more than one airline, or spend time in more than one hotel room, during a trip. Anther new feature is the “+” button in the bottom right corner within the Reservations section of the app. If you have to make some last-minute changes to your trip itinerary, pressing that button will allow you to alter your flight, hotel or other reservations directly in the app, even if you don’t have a confirmation email or number. It even lets you write down notes at the bottom if you need to do so. Finally, the other new feature in the Google Trips update is specifically for bus and rail travelers, which is a popular way to see the sights in Europe. Google says the app update will automatically organize all your past and future train and bus reservations in one location on the app. Are you planning to go on a long vacation this spring or summer, and if so, will you use the new features in Google Trips to help you organize your journey?

International Business Times UK UK World Business Politics Fintech Technology Science Sport Entertainment Opinion Video Pictures Log out Newsletter Signup Smartphones Cybersecurity Innovation Social Media Games Motoring Technology Internet Google becomes first foreign internet company to go live in Cuba Cubans will witness great improvement in Google's services such as YouTube, Gmail and search. By Agamoni Ghosh Updated April 27, 2017 07:20 BST Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt and Cuban national telecom provider president Mayra Arevich shake hands after the signing of a bilateral agreement in HavanaGetty Images Google's local servers went live in Cuba on Wednesday (26 April) months after the internet giant signed a deal with the government following former US president Barack Obama's push for better diplomatic relations with the island nation. The servers are part of Google's global network of caching servers known as GGC nodes. While Google services were earlier accessible on the island, the network was weak as data would have to travel a long distance through a submarine cable that connects Cuba to the internet through Venezuela. However, Cubans will now be able to access Google's content much faster as local servers within the country will speed up the process. Cuba's national telecom Etecsa officially inked a deal with Google back in December 2016, which was approved by the Obama administration in 2015. It finally switched to the service now, making the search giant the first foreign internet company to operate its servers in the country. How will it benefit Cubans? The servers going live does not mean that Cubans will be able to access the internet with speeds available across the US, but will definitely be a stepping stone. Data stored in-country by Google will now load much faster than Cuba's existing setup. A significant improvement is expected in the reception of cached materials, for services like YouTube, Gmail and search. However, everything else like other email services and websites may not be affected as their speed is still dependent on local bandwidth provided by state telecommunications provider. Cuba has one of the lowest internet connectivity in the West and most Cubans can only access the web through a meagre 240 public access wi-fi spots scattered around the country. Moreover, it does not come cheap as an hour of internet access costs $1.50 (£1.17), which is quite high for a country where the average wage is $25 a month.

Casey | April 26, 2017 08:00 am MORE Google has said that all upcoming Chromebooks will run Android apps, but what about the one you already have? Fortunately, Google updated its official list of Android-capable Chromebooks, giving some clues as to when older Chrome OS notebooks will get this powerful feature. This change, first reported by SlashGear, classifies three kinds of Android support for Chromebooks: Planned, Beta Channel and Stable Channel. Stable Channel Chromebooks include the Acer Chromebook R11, Asus' Chromebook Flip C100PA and Google's 2015 Chromebook Pixel. MORE: Best Chromebooks Available Now The vast majority (83 to be precise) of the listed Chromebooks are still marked as "Planned," which reeks of the "it's coming eventually" messaging we've heard about Android on Chrome OS for months. The silver lining of this news is the Beta Channel classification, as Google's hinting that those models are further along. Currently, the only Chromebooks marked as Beta Channel are the Asus Chromebook Flip C302 and Acer Chromebook R13, (two notebooks we gave positive reviews to, with the Flip C302 earning an Editor's Choice award). While Beta Channel Chromebook owners may be excited to install Android support on their devices, you might want to wait for those to become Stable Channel, as we've noticed that apps can stutter and suffer other performance defects during the Beta stage.  Google doesn't want us to get our hopes up too high, noting that Beta classification "does not mean that it will be available in the Stable channel on the next release of Chrome OS." Oddly enough, the document lists the Samsung Chromebook Pro as planned, even though it ships with out-of-the-box support for Android apps. The Samsung Chromebook Plus, the pro's less-powerful sibling, is marked as Stable Channel.

Opinion: Google should fix its erratic reminder system Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/26 2:15pm PDTApr 26, 2017 14 Plus 1 on G+ 52 Share on Facebook 46 Share on Twitter Total Shares112 Applications Editorials Google Article Contents 1 Input methods 2 Quick Access 3 Notifications 4 Allo and Home 5 Conclusion The ability to quickly set a reminder on your phone is one many of us take for granted these days. Smartphones have seemingly always had this basic PDA functionality. Type ‘add reminder’ into the Google search box and you’ll be able to quickly set up a notification to jog your memory about something later on. You can even use the ‘OK Google’ voice command: “remind me to pick up the groceries at 6pm,” for example. Easy-peasy. For most people, this function is used occasionally for something really important they simply mustn't forget. And for those people, it probably works just fine. However, for some people (like me) reminders have become an absolute necessity. I hate to admit it, but I have a really bad memory. Truly awful. For this reason, I am almost entirely dependent on Google’s system of reminders to navigate through each day. My phone will buzz with a reminder around 15 times per day. Some of these are one-offs. Some are recurring. All of them are to remind me to do something important, and without them, there’s no telling what I might forget to do. Don’t get me wrong, I am incredibly grateful that I am able to set reminders on my phone at all. But my extensive use of Google’s reminder system has also led me to conclude that it is inherently flawed. The biggest issue, as I see it, is a lack of consistency. Allow me to explain. Input methods There are currently no fewer than 6 distinct reminder input methods available to a typical Android user: Google app (including Google Assistant on compatible devices) Inbox Keep Calendar Chrome Allo Assistant With so many options, there’s always a convenient way to add a reminder to your Google account, whatever you happen to be doing when the need arises. Not all reminders are created equally, however. Add a reminder using any of the first 3 methods in the list and you’re offered the same basic options, such as when or where you’d like to be reminded and if you’d like the reminder to repeat. Inbox insists on using its ‘snooze’ terminology to denote reminder time, which isn’t ideal but we can handle that. Keep reminders are obviously linked to a specific note so you may not always want to use this option if you’d prefer your notes list to stay nice and tidy. They do still show up in your reminders list on the Google app, though, and can be dismissed from there accordingly. You cannot edit Keep reminders from within the Google app, however. To do that you’ll have hit the “Open in Google Keep” link and go through to the app itself. A Keep entry in the Google app's reminders list. If the experience already seems a little messy, it’s when you add a reminder to the Google Calendar app that things start to get weird. Firstly, these entries default to an ‘all day’ event, which seems a little counter-intuitive. It’s not difficult to change this to a timed reminder, but it's a slight annoyance that this option isn't the default. Secondly, unless you have the ‘Reminders’ box checked, which makes all of your reminders visible in your Calendar, none that you set here will actually deliver a notification. Having this option checked may not be a problem if you have one or two reminders set over the course of the week. But as I’ve already explained, I have many, many more than that. So when I set the Reminders calendar to be visible, in order to have the notifications working, my Calendar looks like this… My eyes!!! It even includes distinct entries for recurring reminders. So if you have a reminder set to recur every day it will show up in the month view for every single day, rather than just the next instance. The result is a mess. Needless to say that completely rules out Google Calendar as a method of input for me. Unfortunately, it took a couple of missed reminders when I didn’t have the option checked to figure out that the calendar functioned in this way. This was obviously frustrating, and I was lucky not to miss out on even more important notifications before I realized they weren't showing up. Another potentially handy way to set a reminder is by searching ‘add reminder’ on the Google homepage in your browser (on desktop or mobile). Regardless of browser or OS, if you’re logged into your Google account you should be able to easily set a reminder this way. Of course, there are a couple of limitations here too. First of all, there is no option to set a recurrence if you use this input method. You can revisit the entry in the Google app later on and set a recurrence there, but that kind of defeats the purpose of being able to add it in your browser in the first place. The second issue is that you can only set the reminder for predetermined times of the day. These include morning, afternoon, evening or night, as well as set times of on the hour (12:00) or half past the hour (12:30). This simply isn’t specific enough for certain tasks, and as a result, I tend to steer clear of adding reminders this way (except in an emergency), preferring the other more feature-rich methods. Quick Access At the moment there isn’t an especially fast way to enter a reminder input from your Android phone’s launcher. The ‘OK Google’ hotword (or Google Assistant on compatible devices) is easily the fastest method currently available, but there are still many of us who don't wish to talk loudly at our phones in public. Or even in private, for that matter. It's also worth mentioning that if you use the voice method this can often lead to misunderstandings or having to type extra information anyway. The Screen Search reminder button - simply not fast enough. The easiest solution would seemingly be to have a one-tap option to go straight into a reminder from your device homescreen. Instead, we have to long-press of the home button (on non-Assistant devices) which brings up Screen Search (previously Now on Tap) and click the pink Reminder button, or we can type ‘Add reminder’ into the search bar or Google app. Both of these routes often feel painfully slow. We do have app shortcuts for Calendar and Keep, which is great. But each app comes with its own feature limitations, discussed earlier, which preclude me from considering either as a viable option. If only the Google app has an "Add reminder" app shortcut or widget, the process would be a breeze. App shortcuts - why can't the Google app copy this approach? If you want to view and manage your reminders list there are several ways to do so. The Google app has a reminders list in the menu, and this is probably the most complete, robust way to manage them. Inbox displays them as pinned items in among your emails, or you can filter out everything else and view them in their own list, which functions similar to the list in the Google app. You can also snooze these in Inbox just as you can with emails. Keep has a section showing any notes that have reminders set against them, but doesn’t concern itself with any reminders not attached to one of its own notes. Lastly, Calendar (as you can see in the image further up) displays every single upcoming reminder alongside all of your other events, rendering it practically unusable. Notifications More examples of inconsistencies across these apps can be found in the notification shade. How each reminder is displayed and the quick actions associated with each vary widely. To dismiss this I must mark all 8 as ‘Finished’, including two I can't even see. When you have multiple Google app reminders they are bundled together in a single notification, rather than separated out into individual items. The only action you can perform is to mark all as ‘Finished’, dismissing every one of them at once. Another thing to remember is that notifications in Nougat only show up to 6 lines of content per app at any one time. So, in the example above there are two reminders I can’t even view without entering into the app. When you do enter into the app to mark individual items complete, that dismisses the notification from the shade entirely. If you were hoping to leave it there for the rest of the day as a glanceable to do list, you’re out of luck. Calendar reminder notifications similarly give you only the option to mark as done, but where they improve over the Google app is that you can tap into each individually and edit the reminder time on the next screen. This won’t affect the other notifications from the app. Inbox notifications are bundled rather more usefully, with each being individually expandable and giving the option to either mark as ‘Done’ or to ‘Snooze’. This offers you greater control over your tasks. While this is much closer to how it should be done, Keep refines this even further. Its notifications are also unbundled and come with two individual actions to choose from, snooze for an hour or snooze for even later. Swipe away the notification and you dismiss the reminder altogether, condemning it to the ‘Past’ section of the reminders list in the Google app. The exception being recurring reminders, which will still come back the next time they are set to recur. This is arguably the best way to handle reminder notifications, but you have to be happy to clog up your Keep list with reminders in order to utilize this. Keep's reminder notification - best in class. Your Google Now feed is yet another place you can interact with your reminder notifications. There, it’s possible to snooze reminders for an hour or mark as finished. But there seems to be little rhyme nor reason to how long reminder cards remain actionable in Google Now. It’s not uncommon for me to see a notification in Google Now long after I’ve dismissed it elsewhere, and vice versa. While the cards remain useful in some instances, this isn't a reliable way to manage your task list. Allo and Home Some of you may have noticed that I haven’t mentioned how the Google Assistant in Allo handles reminders. That’s because for some reason these reminders are kept completely separate from all those discussed above. They won’t appear in any of the other apps and can only be viewed in the Allo app when it notifies you. The notification is displayed as a message from the Assistant itself and it doesn’t appear as though you can snooze it at all, not even if you ask really nicely. Allo isn’t the only way to interact with the Google Assistant, of course, the other being Google Home. You might think that reminders would be a key function of the smart home device, but curiously you still can’t ask Home to remind you of something, months after its release. Even the addition of multi-user support hasn't yet brought with it the ability to add reminders. Much has been written about Home and Assistant still feeling like beta products. With omissions like this, it’s hard to disagree with that. Conclusion By experimenting with Google’s reminder system across all of these apps and interfaces, it’s probably possible to eventually find a way to make it work for you. I would argue that you shouldn’t have to work quite so hard to utilize what is in essence quite a basic service. I’ve tried countless other Android apps in a bid to satisfy my reminder needs, and effectively replace my defective memory. But nothing seems to hit the right balance of good design, usability, and features. Plus, there’s no substitute for being able to easily access my reminders from any device on which I can access my Google account, something Google’s reminder system still boasts over every other option on the Play Store. Still, there has to be a way to merge all of these separate interfaces and functions into a less frustrating experience. I'm sure this isn't a huge priority at Google, but I can dream, can't I? A discrete Google Reminders app would seem an obvious solution. One that plugs into the other Google services but ultimately acts as a standalone master-app might be the best way to alleviate some of these shortcomings and offer the experience I expect from a service like this. Then again, maybe it’s just me. Maybe I’m the only person who uses reminders to quite this extent and I should, in fact, seek help. Hopefully, that’s not the case.

Anything I set using voice is getting marked as done within 10 minutes of them notifying me. At first I thought I was crazy, I was seeing reminders in my Inbox that I had set while driving, but an hour later I'd say to myself "Wait didn't I set a reminder to do X?", only to find I HAD created the reminder, but it was marked as done. I can't figure it out! I opened a ticket with Google only to have some rep tell me I needed to clear my cache, but it still happens even when all my devices are off and browsers closed. Kevin Luther Yup. They have been really messed up. I keep finding them marked as done when j never even got the notice Simon Levin Yes that happens to me all the time. I've come to not rely on reminders for anything serious. catalysto I regularly encounter quirks like this with Google reminders. It's for this reason (and all the other stuff Scott said) that I only ever interact with them via Inbox. Fortunately, I enjoy using Inbox, so using that method is relatively painless for me, but for those who don't... Well hopefully the nightmare ends soon. A centralized reminder database/app seems to be the best solution. ShahinTr I just use events. I never bother using reminder, it's an absolute waste of time and space on calendar. Charles222 I've largely abandoned reminders in favor of calendar events and todoist. Todoist in particular, since it has equally-favored apps for the three OS's I use and Home support. David Ruddock Todoist seems very robust. I always consider trying it, then just don't because most of my reminding comes from calendar events, as you say. I want the solution to feel as integrated as possible. Scott Scrivens I have tried Todoist but I didn't like it. I don't actually remember why though...maybe I'll give it another shot. Waveblade Second on Todoist, just replacing it outright is better and the interface is way better than any other ones I've used. The other thing is context awareness is great. "Send email today at 4PM #" will figure out where it all goes. That is the killer feature about it wheelingdad If you need to set 15 reminders a day then you might look inward instead of trying to create/change a system that fits your issue. Just saying... Scott Scrivens pls halp Bruce Wayne Exactly. 15 reminders in a day is just absurd. I saw one of his screenshots and there was a reminder to "charge his phone". That says it all. Matt That calendar is what Leonard from Memento would have if they made that movie today. XerBlade Everything was just peachy for me using Inbox's reminder tools for all of this... until recently. For the last couple weeks, Google has made an incredibly asinine change where time-based notifications will automatically be marked as Done in just under an hour if you don't do it yourself. Which really mucks things up when you're, what's a simple example that's easy to convey... Say you set a reminder a while back that you forgot about (which is pretty much why you set a reminder in the first place), and it goes off while you're in a movie (and you didn't adjust it to go off later on after you're back from the movie beforehand because, you know, you don't have eidetic memory which is why you need reminders in the first place). Said reminder goes away on its own before the movie ends, so you never actually see it. That kind of BS has been happening to me DAILY since this started. [Notifications you just leave sitting in your inbox forever and never "Snooze" are fine though. Yay.] Kevin Luther I have been missing so many reminders lately as well. It's utter garbage destinyhud Here is what i do. I use google app to set all reminders. it will flow to calendar and keep is just for note taking. Now i set calendar events for more important thing to be reminder me a second time just to be be careful like my monthly mortgage Scott Scrivens This is essentially what I do currently. I wish it just worked from everywhere though. blahmoomoo Allo's subscriptions are kind of broken anyway, though I don't know if that also applies to recurring reminders. I told Allo to tell me the weather every morning, but if you don't chat with the bot on occasion, it stops doing that after about a week. Then I forget that it was supposed to remind me about the weather for a few days after each time that happened. So I have ultimately given up on it. EDIT: to be clear, the subscription is still there. It just forgets to keep sending it after a while if you don't talk to the bot, intentionally or not. 4Ui812 Google needs to fix more than just the reminder system. This is probably the least of their problems. Grey They should also bring Reminders to Gmail. Why is it Inbox-only? The other Inbox feature, Email Reminders, should be baked into the next version of Google. After that, what makes Inbox different? Jason Bell The biggest issue I've been having is that reminders don't always give me a real notification. It's always there in the Google App when I open it, but sometimes there's no notification. sam1331 I was just looking into this today. I've become increasingly dependent on reminders, and basically use it as my to do list these days. However, it definitely could be improved. The thing about the notifications is huge, if I have multiple pop up I have to click on the notification to dismiss one, and then the others are no longer sitting there in my notifications. Then I have to reschedule them to get them to sit there again, which is the whole point of the entire system. If they disappear from my notification shade, how will I remember to do them? I might as well not even use Google's reminder system at all then. It's just so convenient to type "remind me to..." in the search box and have it add whatever it is. MisterAlex I recently got a reminder notification for a "when I get home" reminder that I'd set over a year ago. No freakin' clue what made this particular arrival at home special enough to trigger it again... :v Jen Once they get all THIS stuff straightened out, I'd love the ability to set reminders by Time AND Location. For example, I'd love to say "Remind me to do laundry when I get home tonight" while I'm still at home in the morning... Right now, that would just "remind" me immediately since I'm still at home, or if I set it to a specific time, it might remind me before I get home in the evening or after I've been home a while. It'd also be useful for locations that have open/close times, like stores, where a location-only reminder won't be helpful if you frequently walk by at a time when it's closed. Having a Time + Location context would be immensely helpful! N8SLC This works for me. I use the assistant mostly. Scott Scrivens This. This would be so useful. PHLAK I also rely on reminders heavily. Hover, I limit myself to just using them through Inbox (both on the web and phone) to avoid all this complication. A stand-alone reminders app to "unify" reminder functionality would be awesome. Crossstick You & me Scott. I'm on a 12 person sales team plus a manager. NO ONE, but me uses automated reminders. I can't live without 'em. Ever since the original Palm Pilot ! Keep is my main workhorse for the past couple of years. Alex Renna This is the reason I switched to using a To-Do app (Todoist). There used to be a Gmail add-in (#todo) that stopped development after Google implemented Reminders on Calendar, and acted like you stated, only one occurrence that would move days until it was completed. If that made a come back I would be a happy man. kimbo I haven't had to make any reminders recently but I thankfully haven't experienced these issues before Cakefish I use Keep reminders a few times a month for important stuff like meetings and deadlines. Dozens of reminders a day? I wouldn't want to be that dependant on technology to function properly in everyday life. I can usually remember the mundane everyday stuff pretty well on my own, such as remembering to buy food and eat it, drink to keep myself hydrated, charge my phone when the battery gets low, go to the toilet, breathe in and out etc. Everyone's different though! Each to their own. Shakil Shaikh Jut install Tasks, the app formally known as Astrid: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.tasks Workflow wise, resizable/fiterable widgets do it for me (they also provide a quick way to enter a categorised task). Persistent notifications help in some cases too. Mostly though, it's the only to-do app that offers recurring tasks on both scheduled date (every 3rd Monday) or on completed date (3 weeks since last completed). It'd probably be quicker and healthier than waiting for Google to create some kind of compromised workflow for you instead. Scott Scrivens I was actually an avid Astrid user back in the day. Miss that little octopus. My issue with this as a solution is that I always need to use my phone. I'm looking for cross-device/platform integration. LaserWraith I tried to use Google's reminders in the past but gave up for reasons similar to yours. Todoist keeps me on track now across all my devices and it's pretty great. Some flaws still, but a big improvement. Raymond Berger Have you tried TickTick? I've been using it for years and it was been absolutely fantastic. It works across many platforms and has a relatively simple interface but also plenty of options for power users. Trip66 Been using it for years I love it...Bought it Immediately.+1 N8SLC You can de-select the reminders calendar. As for the rest, I think the sheer volume is on you. ;) Scott Scrivens You can, but then any reminder you set using Calendar won't work. Deeco PREACH AP!!! Please make more articles like these to highlight these simple anoying flaws. Let us be heard and get Google off​ their backside! ellett Why can't a reminder play a sound? As it stands now you can get an email or have a notification pop up, but everything is silent, which is useless if I'm doing something else when the reminder triggers. If I need an alarm, I have to set a reminder several hours in advance to remind me to set a phone alarm. Sophie Yes, many of these things have been bothering me, too! The state of Google's reminder system is much like their chat/messaging apps: confusing and fragmented (Ok, maybe it's not as bad as the chat/messaging apps). Like the author, I also rely on reminders (my calendar looks alot like his!). I primarily interact with them through the Google app, as well as a script I wrote for the Linux command-line that allows me to quickly add timed reminders (Google calls them quick events) to a special "My reminders" calendar (I wish I could save them to the default Reminders calendar that Calendar and the Google app seem to use, but it seems off-limits to developers). If Google's voice-to-text translation was better, I would stick to the Google app, I really don't mind talking at my phone, in public or otherwise, but it's not great. I have to correct things so often that I might as well type it in half the time (hence the command-line script). bdbplatano 🍻 Here's to hoping Google's paying attention🍻 Wolfie410 My biggest issue had to do with recurring reminders set through Google Now/Assistant. I was unable to clear a reminder ahead of schedule, without completely deleting the future occurrences of the recurring task. The only other option was to wait for the notification to pop and then dismiss it. Not very convenient. Have beem using the splendo to-do list. Rudresh Another way is to set an alarm with a note, works best for me. Lateef Alabi-Oki I wonder how hard it is to create a single reminder service, with a consistent API and behavior, that all their front-end services and third-party apps can use? Just thinking out loud here. Bruce Wayne I can't imagine why you would need a reminder to charge your phone. Trip66 Many of these shortcuts can be added to the homescreen in most launchers and especially in Nova but I use the OK Google method and several times a day. "Remind me in one hour that at 2pm so and so is coming by to.... That type of stuff... and I plan my whole day everyday so I don't forget someone is coming by or I have to be somewhere etc etc. It's a godsend to me and I can do it all hands free and 90% of the time it's in the car via BT. Awesome.ability. I fix computers all day so I'm always picking up or dropping off and also people drop and pickup to me so it reminds me when so I dont leave if someone is coming over or I have to be to their place at a specific time. But I haven't had any issues with them being marked as done or anything and they always go off at the time I say to. Viral Kacha https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5ee1efd75a870942aa10e7ecb1adcdfe05ac836338f4823d2d7a45180f970b2b.png "If only the Google app has an "Add reminder" app shortcut or widget, the process would be a breeze." Inbox app has the widget and it's quite neat and inclusive of all the features. Luzandro I also use the inbox widget, which works quite well for me, except when the shown presets for snoozing aren't appropriate (which is quite often the case for me, as the soonest suggestion is in the evening) it takes surprisingly many steps to choose something different TedPhillips yesss. the bundling gets me since if i finish one reminder but have a few overlapping (but not too many like you), need to be very aggressive but also careful about notification shade grooming. out of sight out of mind and all that. A+ Simon Levin Thank you. If only Google cared to fix their old products. Nathan J For me, reminders have always been crap on both platforms. On Android, I used an app called Lotify. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nll.lotify The nice thing about this app is that you have a ton of options, and a huge selection of icons to choose from, so if you have a lot, they stand out from one another. I expected iOS to be leaps and bounds ahead, because an iPhone just works, right? Not so fast. I found iOS lacking in that regard. Via Reddit, I found an app called "HiFutureSelf" that simulates a text message. You put in the message and the time you want to receive it. You can set a unique ringtone for the app. And when the time comes, you get your message. It suits my purposes. There might be better options, but I haven't seen any, personally. Ryan Warmack Business calendar pro hits the nail on the head for me. ilovetesla can anybody petition google to make adding birthdays and anniversaries to calendar easy Alicia Frederick Inbox has a widget you can add to the home screen on your phone for single tap quick access, which might help with the notifications since Inbox does them better. Jeremy Couch One thing that I hate is that when you dismiss Android notifications of reminders from Keep they mark it as Done. So I stopped using Keep for reminders. Very annoying. Ste Tan Excellent article. Reminders have been a pain for me as well throughout Google services. I've tried so many different apps—apps like todoist,etc— that just isn't as convenient for me compared to a native solution by Google. I eventually just went back to using Calender and keep for reminders and though it does become aggravating, I've grown to just deal with it since I need to use it daily. A Google reminders app would be perfect, especially since it would seemlessly sync and work consistently throughout all my Android devices plus any other device I have my Google account connected to. I really hope Google sees this article and takes it into consideration. Fabian Todt personally i like how google calender reminders show up, that's exactly how/why i use them: these are tasks/todos i have to do at this very moment so they are like an event/meeting. this is somehow similar to the getting things done method: i've got all tasks in todoist and plan them as reminders in calender when i have to do them. Neil S The article says that there is no widget for reminders that can be added to the home screen. I have one on my phone. The Google inbox app has a reminder set up widget which is quick to use. Just tape the reminder widget button and enter the reminder text, then hit the clock icon to set it for any time you like and to repeat if you like.

Google Photos v2.14 is preparing personalized experiences and sharing suggestions based around facial recognition [APK Teardown] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/04/26 5:08pm PDTApr 26, 2017 21 Plus 1 on G+ 40 Share on Facebook 39 Share on Twitter Total Shares100 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News When the Photos app launched in 2015, Google had already been working on computer vision for many years. It was no surprise that object recognition was a major draw for the app, and automatic sorting of pictures by person with the use of facial recognition became a must-have feature. Google is now looking to leverage this technology to make the Photos app a bit more social. A teardown of the latest Photos update reveals the service will soon offer additional features based around facial recognition, and even encourage users to share pictures with the people detected in them. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. Since facial recognition is a sensitive privacy topic, it's worth a quick sanity check to reduce confusion and knee-jerk reactions going into this teardown. Everything discussed here is opt-in and the features will not work if users do not select a photo of themselves, and that means nothing can happen accidentally or without granting permission. Furthermore, most of the features are only slightly modified versions of existing aspects of the app and pose no additional risk to privacy. I'll leave it up to each reader to determine how they feel about the remaining functions and their practical implications. Face recognition for personalization, sharing, and more Instead of opening with the reason this feature might be useful, I'm going to jump straight to a summary of how Google is going to present it. Quite simply, the Photos app is going to ask users to "personalize" their experience by selecting a picture of themselves from the list of previously identified faces. If you already named yourself, the group might be renamed "Me" after making the selection. <string name="photos_facegaia_optin_impl_title">Personalize Google Photos by labeling your face</string> <string name="photos_facegaia_optin_impl_desc">Which face is yours?</string> <string name="photos_facegaia_optin_impl_picker_face_picker_title">Select your face</string> <string name="photos_facegaia_optin_impl_confirmation_toast_msg">All set! Try searching for “Me”.</string> Face recognition isn't just the tool, it's actually part of the pitch to get users interested. Google's explanation is broken up into two parts, the first of which offers to reward users for choosing a face with "personalized search, creations, and more." <string name="photos_facegaia_optin_impl_detailed_desc0">Get personalized search, creations, and more based on your face?</string> Personalized search is explained by the toast message above – it just means you can search for "me" to find pictures of yourself. I assume "creations" are the same auto-generated albums, collages, and animations we usually see in the Assistant tab, but obviously focused on you, the user. Both of these sound like things we have now. <string name="photos_facegaia_optin_impl_detailed_desc1">Allow your contacts' Google Photos apps to recognize your face in photos for faster sharing? &lt;a href=help:&gt;More&lt;/a&gt;</string> It's the second part of the explanation where things get interesting. If you have identified your face for Google Photos, you can also give permission to have the app on other people's phones recognize you when pictures are taken. To be clear, this can only happen for people if they are in your contact list and if you've given permission for it to make matches.

settings for managing the new facial recognition features, but they are just there to turn the grouping features on and off, or to change the face you selected in the past – perhaps you tapped on the

My biggest question is what users will see after they take a picture of somebody else and a match is made. Primarily, will the photographer be prompted to share the photo, will it quietly include some visual marker that somebody was detected, or will it remain quiet and simply make intelligent suggestions if the share button is pressed? A big feature like this is probably not going to trigger quietly, so I expect notifications, but that could get pretty overwhelming after something like an office party or family reunion. Unfortunately, I'm sure there are many unanswered questions, and since the implementation isn't done and there are missing pieces, there aren't going to be answers quite yet. The potential problem for features like this is that they tip-toe right up to the line where many people feel uncomfortable about potential privacy issues. It looks like Google has done a good job of designing barriers to avoid some of those issues, and it's clear users are responsible for making their own decisions. It's important that this is an opt-in feature by default. I do like the idea of using facial recognition to smooth out the rough edges of sharing photos with people, especially if it also acts as a reminder. I admit, I have a bad habit of taking pictures of friends and forgetting to share them later. If this goes well, Google might have the killer feature that turns Photos into a must-use service.

Morten Ulv You'll be able to archive photos you don't want in the main photo view. Then it'll be safe to show photos to your family. Southern Discomfort Yep, see this as super profitable for the big G. Knows your face, scans all your pictures and notices a slew of recent pictures all showing Best Buy in the background. Guess what shows up in your Gmail inbox within moments...?? Yeah, I don't know. This sounds like the tide turning type of thing and is actually kinda spooky for me. I get that Goog does this type of thing, but dang... Willie Chalmers III I really doubt that's going to happen. It's a slippery slope, and if they wanted to do that, they likely would have done it by now to some extent, and people would notice. James Briano Oh, Google already knows. When I search Drive for "Best Buy" I get a lot of interesting results. Example attached. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/45ff7b47285e47474877510e0456d559a7344aca80b48062d208178aa0e33897.jpg Theo Logian There is likely location data attached to that photo rather than image recognition of that big yellow tag. tik Yup... location based versus recognizing text in the image. trekker Photos face recognition is brilliant - especially when visiting a friend and quickly being able to find photos from the past to enjoy together. However currently they decide who gets a name label (or tag) and this means i have many people who remain unsearchable. Please can we manually add names ourselves? The system where Google provides choices for names does not work. whispy_snippet "you can also give permission to have the app on other people's phones recognize you when pictures are taken." Doesn't Google Photos already effectively do this? If I go to the auto generated "people" album I can see a whole bunch of photos of people clustered via facial recognition. Yes, I had to turn this feature on and individually label people, but the end result is now effectively the same. My app recognises faces. Jens M Eichkorn What's new is that it will associate faces with actual names / Google accounts whispy_snippet Sure, I understand that. But what I'm trying to say is that if a user chooses to do so, they can make Google Photos do this already. The tear down gives the impression that a person needs to opt-in to allow their face to be recognised in images taken by someone else. What I'm saying is that I can already go into my Photos app, enable face recognition, label some faces and bam, I'm getting the same result. This teardown suggests people can soon can opt-in to something that's already effectively live anyway. What seems new is that the process looks more streamlined. But I'd have thought many people would be more concerned with a right to opt-in to facial recognition, not a right to opt-in to a more streamlined process. Am I making sense? I feel like I'm not articulating myself well here. JG Doesn't Google Photos already effectively do this? From the article: Furthermore, most of the features are only slightly modified versions of existing aspects of the app and pose no additional risk to privacy. whispy_snippet Ah yep, I must have missed that bit. Well it makes sense. But yeah, I guess my other key question still stands - why is there a need to give people the option to opt-in to something that's effectively out of their hands? Your face can already be recognised in someone else's Google Photos "people" album. David Hyman What if it knew you were together and it automatically shared the pictures with other people. Basically automatically creating a shared album Paul_Werner I'd love that Kevfromspace Any news on printing Google Photos albums a la Apple Photos Books? tik Definitely excited with all of the new updates.

[Update: Just headphones for employees] Google-branded wireless headphones show up at the FCC Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/26 10:28am PDTApr 26, 2017 82 Plus 1 on G+ 136 Share on Facebook 111 Share on Twitter Total Shares329 Google News Update 1: 2017/04/26 10:30am PDT An anonymous tipster has shed some light on what these almost certainly are. Google issues headphones to a large number of its employees, and the current model is getting quite Well this is... unexpected. We've heard whispers of a new Google Home/Google WiFi combo, and even the next Pixel devices, but nothing in the realm of audio products. Out of nowhere, a set of headphones from Google have appeared in a new FCC filing. The headphones, which are identified as 'GID5B,' are definitely a bit odd. One side has a power button, and the other a simple Google logo, both in a circle matching Google's logo colors. According to the documents, these headphones support Bluetooth connectivity - but there doesn't appear to be any mention of a microphone. As with many wireless headphones, there is an AUX connector if you don't want to mess with Bluetooth. Strangely, there is a microUSB port for charging - not USB Type-C. According to the user manual included in the FCC filing, GID5B has a 600mAh battery. It's very possible that this was filed to get clearance on the internal radio, which could later be included on a different pair of headphones. The microUSB port, lack of microphone functionality, and no Google Assistant features seems to back up this claim. It would be a bit strange for Google to release headphones without any unique functionality, using an old port. Update 1: 2017/04/26 10:30am PDT An anonymous tipster has shed some light on what these almost certainly are. Google issues headphones to a large number of its employees, and the current model is getting quite long in the tooth. We've got a picture of it below. As you can see, it bears the same power button iconography as the ones in the FCC filing above. These headphones are distributed for use only inside Google and are not sold anywhere - they're just for Googlers. This new ANC Bluetooth version is just an update on the design, probably meant to replace these older headsets as they're phased out. So, no: Google is not releasing a really ugly wireless headphone with a microUSB port and no microphone. Well, not to anyone except Googlers.

Not Google's... #facepalm FRGuzman That's actually Google's official merchandise store. Admittedly, it does look fake. It's run by a third party company that has the license to produce merchandise with G's logo, though. MJ How do we know this? Source? Why would Google use like a 3rd rate company for this? Anyone have a link from Google's website to that site? Gobelet The SSL certificate was delivered by Google themselves. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2ec49ef6e0020e3a0c8436a7f6610146bd0e573f443b2d220fc2a5baf5ed48be.png MJ Well played sir... Best proof after a half dozen comments. Again, why have a third rate looking store site that looks like crap/fake? FRGuzman I did some research on it a couple of months ago as I was looking for a Google decal and stumbled upon this website and it looked kinda shady to me too. I can't recall all the evidence I gathered but I ended up convinced it was legit. I'd say Google doesn't care too much about branded merchandising and they off loaded it to a third party company that in my opinion doesn't even offer compeling or quality looking goods. Shagnscooby Weird. I knew they had a merch store but I certainly didn't think there was electronics there that weren't on the store.google.com They must not make or design the merch ones and it's just a logo slapped on. MJ They don't... It's a fake store. Shagnscooby It's not fake. I've done telephone survey's for Google and one of the payment options was a Google Merch store gift card instead of other gift cards. MJ Google does telephone surveys? Who even answers telephone surveys or picks up on unrecognized numbers? mog386 Wrong. It's legit. Lol. You dolt.

MJ Really? You had go with the name calling? I don't care what the fucking website says... It doesn't look legit at all. Even if they have the rights to slap the Google logo on shit they aren't Google's products. The OP was wrong about the headphones. Aaron Berlin I'm guessing those are just white label goods with Google branding on them, so GOOG wouldn't actually file with the FCC. Maybe??? MJ It's not official merchandise!

David Ruddock I'm sorry, but not even close. MJ LOL I beat you to it David. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I mean they are both headphones... Dan Proctor Mentioned it above but my comment was aimed at these going into their merchandise store vs a real consumer product. My company offers the same generic branded things that go through the FCC as our own products. Very common among the bigger companies of the world. David Ruddock They could, but seeing as we've never seen any headphones go through under Google's name before, I have my doubts. Dan Proctor As in these look like they will be going into this store. Same as other people have said about them being the generic items Google offers at events and to employees. David Mendívil if this thing has an internal FM radio receiver (analog), I will get one Sashank Narayan What mainstream headphones even have that capability? Justin W I can answer this: none. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And why? FM radio still exists? David Mendívil dude, not everyone lives in EEUU or EUROPE, most of the human population still hears analogical radio stations Matt It's not just a Europe thing. I live in the US and I have not listened to FM radio in years. Erstam Same. I despise analog radio. Do many commercials plus it usually sounds like crap. DanSan I don't even know where the FM radio button is in my car. /s yes i do but you get the point. David Mendívil Sorry EEUU is USA in Spanish hehe but at least in south america, it is quite common to still have the good old FM radio stations, having a data plan is still too expensive Matt Oh, right. I even know that. I think having it right next to EUROPE my brain just combined it all. podme Probably giveaways to employees and swag for events, etc Jarrett Lennon Kaufman They'd be better off rebranding OEM headphones for just that, though, and could skip this process. Mordalo I'm more concerned about the sound quality. If they sound good and don't break my bank account (or my mortgage payment), I'd be happy to get another set of good Bluetooth cans. They don't need to be always on or listening (even though this is Google). mlm5em Sees Headline: Must buy immediately Sees Mirco USB: Run away T4rd What wireless headphones (or any phone/PC accessories) have USB-C ports yet? Erstam My phone is usb c. My Chromebook only had usb c. I have a mouse and keyboard that are usb c. My battery pack is usb c. Come to the future brother. It's great!. I use the same cable to charge everything normally too. I actually had the same thought as the guy above. I'm not buying anything that's not usb c any more. It's not future proof and i rarely have to carry a non c cable anymore (except on a trip i bring an extra micro usb for my gf s7). T4rd So your mouse and keyboard.. that's pretty much it. I agree, I would only like to buy USB C accessories as well, but it seems they're not picking it up any time soon still. catalysto So you're being purposefully obtuse. T4rd Likewise. catalysto That's a yes. T4rd For you. DanSan https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5e55bc06067cf74753d28062e8aaf21244bf97f17ad555a1d4b58976f73be2bf.gif catalysto Interesting angle you took there.

I was looking for one to replace my MAX Anywhere 2. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Lol. This is ridiculously ugly T4rd Headphones with Cast built in..? Could be cool. marcusmarcus2 That is the first thing I thought when I read the headline makapav That would be a pretty good idea - as long as it also has a mic for calls and gives the option for filtering in ambient sound/noise when needed. Rinkesh621 How about cast and miniature Google home, so you can order pizza, while you stream your music from your Spotify while you watch e-sport games with Picture in Picture of watching old Charlie Chaplin silent film? No.... just a though. lol SpeakethTheTruth Sounds like a Pimp My Ride episode. Lateef Alabi-Oki 600mAh battery for a headphone? What are they aiming for? A week long battery life. Jay I'd probably buy them because Google. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ 4Ui812 They'll probably have issues out of the box because .... Google ¯_(ツ)_/ Mohamed Fixaal And they'll later release 10 new headphones and change their names later in because Google.. ¯_(ツ)_/ David’s Flattop Reigns Supreme Wow, Its a trifecta of wisdom!! Diego Opazo SV-Cross ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ After that they'll release a companion app ecosystem only to abandon them altogether because ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Ray And then one model will shut down randomly with 35% battery still remaining. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ David’s Flattop Reigns Supreme even more helpful.... Nexus✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Guess I've gotten mostly lucky, my two galaxy nexus, nexus 4, 5, 7, google home, chromecasts, nexus player, and pixel didn't have problems out of the box. my 5x developed crazy slowness over time rendering it barely useful (and I've flashed all sorts of roms and formatted storage and disabled encryption). Nigel Antonio im right there with you, but ad a nexus 1. and a Pixel to the mix. Dennis Lockhart Maybe but they'll be in 'beta' so a fix is just down the road a bit. ;-) 4Ui812 LOL Andrey Simakov They are Google because Google. David’s Flattop Reigns Supreme Well that was helpfull Glen Barrington Then they'll abandon the whole thing because Google.. ¯_(ツ)_/ John Marshall’s Ghost Why isn't this USB C? I have a Pixel XL and my wife has the Nexus 5X. We have switched our lives over to USB C. Why would I want to carry around another cable or an adapter just for a set of headphones? I have not been able to find a set of USB C wireless headphones and for the life of me, I can't understand why. vmxr ugly Cael That G looks like a Q to mean. Clearly the Nexus Q2 /s Thomas Larsen It's a power button Cael I was being sarcastic... Thomas Larsen I know, even without the /s makiller The manual showing an aux cable included reinforces for me that Google will keep the headphone jack on the next Pixel again. I doubt they'd include an aux cord with their new branded headphones if their new branded phone couldn't even use it..... right? These are kind of ugly though. ITGuy11 Right. Cause your going to need that headphone jack due to Pixel 2 Bluetooth issues ¯_(ツ)_/¯ JG Counter point... That assumes everyone at Google will be using the Pixel 2. I would imagine some (especially those developing for iOS) use iPhones. And several probably carry around Galaxy devices etc... You don't have to eat McDonalds for every meal just because you work there... You're also further assuming the aux cord is to be plugged into the phone. Maybe the aux port is included so the headphones can connect to the employee's computer terminal. Or maybe the equipment in the campus gym, like at my gym, lack bluetooth and need a wired connection in order to listen to the built in TV/music player. Or since Google will only need a small quantity I would imagine it would probably have been easier and cheaper just to use parts already in production rather than asking whoever is actually building them to create custom hardware for a relatively small order. That would also explain why the charge port is microUSB and not USB-C. DanSan just curious, is there a reason why you'd expect a microphone for these? I'm just guessing here but these don't look like gaming or professional use headphones which would be the only time they might require a mic. This looks more like trying to capture the hype of other products like beats. No idea but do beats have a built in mic? I get it, maybe it would be good for assistant if it had a mic but not sure i see lack of microphone a drawback, especially when similar headphones dont have them matteventu For... Calls? DanSan do other headphones that look or fit in this same category have the same functionality? i only ask because the article is written as if not having a mic is a knock against the product yet i dont think anything else in this space has a mic. Miku is Best Vocaloid Most of them do. matteventu Aurevoir 3.5mm jack on Pixel 2. Damnit. Fr0gg0 It's not like anyone outside Google would want to wear those. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Never underestimate the power of branding. sebastianer Yeah....for less than 150€ you can get some AKG K701s headphones.(that you can mod if you need more Low frequency). And for 100 USD you can get a Schiit Fulla 2 amazing DAC and reasonable good amp. That's all you need for a decent audio quality nowadays. Tom Harman Yes Please! Jeffrey Spiers I'll be scouring Ebay for these... icyhotmike Supported for 3 months and then left dry to die a slow and unfixed death -Every Google product KRS_Won Google Listen™ Built with Cast® I'd prob buy em. Rinkesh621 Those earmuff bezels tho ! Complimentary with Pixel 2? Alfonso Surroca It's a shame this headset is internal-only. A Google headset such as this would fit nicely with their consumer product mix, especially if it only worked in conjunction with all-new dedicated messaging and voice apps. G Suite Headset Messenger by Google has a nice ring to it. Rod Moore What is this AUX you speak of? All of Goggles phones have USB-C ports. Plus the Chromebooks are coming out with USB-C. Very odd to be using a older USB auxiliary port. hzd Bluetooth Google headphones . . . Haha expect less work to get done at Google from here on in, Google's relationship with any BT is always Rocky !

[Update: Official] Google Keyboard is now Gboard with v6.0 update—includes integrated search, dedicated number row, multiple active languages, and more [APK Download] Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2016/12/17 2:10am PDTDec 17, 2016 83 Plus 1 on G+ 242 Share on Facebook 83 Share on Twitter Total Shares408 Applications Google News Update 1: 2016/12/17 2:43am PST GBoard is now official. Google announced it on its Keyword blog, focusing on the new search and share options, multilingual support, and GIF insertion. Google released a keyboard app for the iPhone some months back called Gboard, and everyone was wondering if it would come to Android. Well, now it has as the v6.0 update to Google Keyboard. It's not only a name change, though. There are a few important new features, including a search shortcut and true multi-language support. The update is still rolling out, and Google has not yet posted an official changelog. Here's what we've spotted so far. G button (enabled in settings) offers quick access to search from the keyboard Pop-out toolbar (when G button not enabled) provides access to themes, settings, one-handed mode, and search Optional dedicated number row Up to three active languages with preference for one (previously had to switch) Gesture typing is now called Glide typing. Search for emoji Rearranged emoji panel with group selection at bottom Emoji have bright halo effect around them GIF button is always shown, but disabled in apps without support. We'll update if we spot anything else, but this should be most of it. Keep in mind, the G button is optional because you can still access integrated search from the toolbar pop-out. It's just one extra step. It's up to you if you prefer to just have the button. That's cool and all, but the dedicated number row will make a lot more people happy. You have to turn that on in settings as well. Those on the team who speak multiple languages seem quite excited about the multiple language support too. You can actually type in up to three of them without manually switching keyboard modes. This is similar to the way SwiftKey does it. The update is just starting to roll out, but we've got the new version on APK Mirror (Android 4.2 and higher). Note, it's in a different area of APK Mirror than the old Google Keyboard, but it is just an update. Update 1: 2016/12/17 2:43am PST GBoard is now official. Google announced it on its Keyword blog, focusing on the new search and share options, multilingual support, and GIF insertion.

Brad "Google released a keyboard app for the iPhone some months back called Gboard, and everyone was wondering if it would come to Android. Well, now it has as the v6.0 update to Google Keyboard. " AbbyZFresh iOS users barely even use Swiftkey. Let alone Gboard. K.P. Smith Good info. Ryan should include that in the very first sentence of this article that your commenting on ...

Marko Šaric It's not a big deal. It got wiped off. Robert Trance What phone if i might ask...? Marko Šaric Nexus 5x. jesuguru Knuckles (for screen)? Fork and knife (for eggs)? Marko Šaric Hand for dipping bread in egg yolk. Dominic81 "multiple active languages" FINALLY!!! WORPspeed THIS!!! SO much this! I was excited for gboard, but lack of this was holding me back, but reading that it is now included, I can say ADIOS SWIFTKEY! Or maybe it doesn't work as good :P Swiftkey isn't bad, just excited about gboard :D motoridersd Same! I love SwiftKey, but it can do some annoying things from time to time. I'm definitely going to be check out this new Gboard. WORPspeed And I already switched back to swiftkey. The delete swipe gesture on gboard is just horrible, it should just delete 1 word per swipe, not every either 1 letter or the whole sentence.....needs an undo button. The layout...well I'm just used to Swiftkey's layout and the way swiftkey is smart enough to isnert a space after a comma....small things that make gboard a horrible experience for me. I do keep it around incase I want to sent a gif/meme image, it's easier switching keyboards then apps :D motoridersd Yeah, the placement of the question and exclamation marks on Gboard is awful. Too many taps to get to them (they're probably hiding behind another key, but I didn't go hunting for them). Not getting a space after a comma, or getting a space after a word when putting in a question mark was annoying. The delete gesture is definitely not good on Gboard. Jordan Long press m or n is too many taps for question marks and exclamation points? Or press and slide on the period key? They're all very easy to get to. Also the slide-to-delete action is great. I don't know of any keyboard that does it in a significantly better way. motoridersd Turns out I had the symbol setting turned off, so I didn't see any of the characters on the letters or the period. The slide to delete on Swiftkey works very well because it works on the whole keyboard, not just on the backspace key. I've been spoiled by just swiping anywhere to delete a typo. You have to disable flow typing for this to work, but I don't miss that feature. Zorkos You don´t need an undo button. After you delete something the deleted text will appear as a suggestion Urs Müller It also doesn't seem to predict the next word. Instead it shows options for the currently swyped word... Also back to Swiftkey for now. Rapper_skull My dream came true. Rod Our* Rod What? Like in Swiftkey? rauldzmartin Exactly. Mario Porfírio Souza I hope that feature works well, because in swiftkey dont work well HARAMBE It doesn't even correct italian words with some french shit! GLORIOUS Vincent Bye bye SwiftKey samiazza Can somebody explain how does this work? Georgiy Alexandrov I guess it will predict words for both languages depend on what you type in, without need of switching languages manually. Apps By Usman basically what swype provided years ago :) (it's good to see google adapt it) bat0nas Exactly. Been using multiple language in Swype for years. HaltestelleLuitpolthafen I text in both German and English, but 75% of the time in English. I don't have to go into settings and manually switch it from English to Germany anymore, I can have it do it on the fly and set it to prefer English since that is what I predominantly speak. Felix /Offtopic When I interpret your username right you're from Mannheim? Why do you speak English predominantly? ;) mitchilin You don't have to go into settings. Just press the world icon on the keyboard and it changes language instantly. I've been doing this for years with German. snoop doge what do you exactly mean by it? Ashish Bogawat It is a good start, but Swiftkey has quite a headstart with support for many more languages. It (Swiftkey) even does English & Hindi, even though they use different scripts. I type in English and it suggests matching Hindi words along with the English suggestions. Ash Google has that as well, but that keyboard is Google Indic keyboard prediscover no asian language support though :( Ash Hindi, Tamil etc are Asian language. Fir Chinese there is seperate keyboard prediscover I thought Hindi had a separate keyboard too jenderalcilik I too excited for this. I installed right away after reading that sentences. I mean I always loved Swiftkey, but sometimes I hate it when it loads so slow when I switch from app to app. I hope this worked well. Eddy Nelson Lopez This is so épico ahora puedo change languages sin tener que touch the world icono 😂😂 Total Insecurity Hahaha^^ Robert Trance LOL, you so won this thread.... Avishek Jajajajaja Lord Argyris One upvote, duly earned. El_Big_CHRIS My main reason for sticking to SwiftKey, maybe I'll finally ditch it iiku it is also available for chrome spellchecking. Vratislav Jindra "multiple active languages" I HATE IT SO MUCH!!! I've never used it on other keyboards which had this feature. When I'm tapping, the keyboard usually guesses the language correctly. But when I start the text with swiping, it's more like 50:50 - sometimes it guesses the correct word, but very often it also offers me a word from a different language. I'd rather keep pressing the "switch language" button on my keyboard to switch languages manually instead of relying on a technology which fails half the time. bidou I don't like it either. It always writes the wrong word from the wrong language. You can disable it in the keyboard options and go back to the normal "press the switch language icon" type. Vratislav Jindra You're right, I must have missed that setting. Thank you very much! Hamilton Jimenez Vasquez It's happening!! Aleluya! I've been waiting eagerly for this feature since Google Keyboard supports Gif images. Sorry Swiftkey but now is time to move on. HopTzop Too bad it doesn't work well, at least here it's a pain in the arse. Also sometimes doesn't get the whole sliding and gives just a letter, sometimes it gives a totally different word that has nothing to do with what you slide, but happens to start with that letter. They just made me buy Swype which feels like it's reading my mind and runs buttery smooth. tattoos for men I totally agree with you. Bewear ARM64 only :c aSquard http://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/gboard/gboard-6-0-65-141378828-release/gboard-6-0-65-141378828-armeabi-v7a-android-apk-download/ Bewear Thanks. Brian ARM64 though :( Phoenix FUUUUDGE Andy Roid Whaaaa Adrianus AJ Nadeak There's an ARM version available. Michael Carr Can't say I'm a fan of the name change, but the new features sound cool. Downloading! Phoenix OMG is this really happening ? is this really happening ? FINALLY Carson Saldanha Ohh yeah... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4f2ee8ed9e24df5ba9a662d9616186472912325d74b164a358934193cba8e8ef.gif Phoenix I spoke too soon, it's still not happening for ARM owners lol just ARM64 Carson Saldanha Hopefully APKMirror will have the arm version soon. Artem Russakovskii Up now. Volodesi A number row? Finally. I can stop using SwiftKey. k0n And symbols hinting! I can have it set up almost exactly like SwiftKey now, but with added benefits and no extra app required :) FrozenHotChocolate Trying this right away!. But will still need a lot of improvements on the predictions front to pull me away from Swiftkey though. Michael Schaap Neat. Looks like it finally has most of the features I'm using Swiftkey for. (Number 1: multiple languages simultaneously – I tend to type in meerdere talen tegelijk; number 2: number row.) I guess I'll have to try it out and see if it beats Swiftkey yet. (Its prediction is still scarily accurate, though.) Rod It's been said here that it now supports multiple languages simultaneously. Michael Schaap Indeed. That's what I'm saying. Rod It's like a dream came true, until I saw the arm64 requisite.. Comediante "Optional dedicated number row" - It was about time! Only thing I miss is the hability to theme choosing colors (primary/accent) from a material color pallete and not just choose from a limited theme gallery. Jaime Andres Salame Borja Does it have Gif search? AdamH Yup, only works in Hangouts tho.. Artem Russakovskii Not only. In Messenger too. Badouken And Allo :P Abhilash Bingi Yup, but the app has to support it. Only Messenger and Hangouts do as of now. Rod No love for 32 bit. :( Baalinooo Not available for Nexus 6 then? :( Ten Bears not yet anyway... Rod Nope. CD RW ARM apk now available ntomka You don't have to wait for long. I got it through Google play update to my Honor 6 Plus, which is a 32bit phone. 😃 Rapper_skull Then upload the APK to APKMirror. EDIT: Never mind, it has already been uploaded. Rod Excellent news.

Textra has emoji prediction XerBlade But it's a single SMS app, not something that magically adds stuff to the keyboard, so it doesn't help you in literally every other app on your device. wade_county I must be blind, where in the settings is emoji prediction in Textra? Corey Kinard If only Textra would use, or allow as an option, stock Android's quick reply in the notifications (where it sticks) and also added the stock inline reply option in heads up messages. It feels so cluncky to have their huge "quick reply" screen pop up now. I guess they could slim the app a bit by dropping the GIFs too since it's in Gboard. Marcus Clendenin You can search in the emoji keyboard. It's not as nice as the emoji prediction in Swiftkey but it does help when trying to find an emoji Cakefish Emoji search doesn't work for me. Just says "data for emoji search is not available". Weird. Checked permissions. Checked internet connectivity. Marcus Clendenin I saw a reddit comment that said the initial download needs to happen on WiFi? So maybe try doing that. I haven't been on WiFi today so I can't confirm whether that works Cakefish You sir, are a gentlemen and a scholar! Thanks! Jacques Ligier Can anyone confirm whether it works? Robert Trance I can predict for you... Marko Šaric Poll: What was your first search ever with gboard for android? AfrodanJ Pictures of Santa PHLAK What about gif support? Kyle Gospodnetich It's been there for months. Aaron I see it but it's crossed out here. Guess it only works on apps that support it. Artem Russakovskii Yeah, the button is now permanent, just disabled in app that don't support it, which is different than the previously confusing contextual GIF button. JSo You can now do a search with the keyboard which will pull up gifs in the results like it does by hitting the "gif" button. I tried it in Inbox but it inserts the link and not the gif itself. Anthony Castanza Its actually happening!! But what are we going to complain about now?! Oh wait, Allo. Nevermind. Michael Kennedy Fuckin' Allo... :( rauldzmartin Is it not killed by Google yet? Cesar Something something no sms fallback... Rapper_skull Multi-language is not exactly what I wanted. I now see IT - EN - ES, meaning that I will receive suggestions for Italian, English and Spanish. But what I really wanted was scrolling the spacebar to switch language, so that I can type Greek letters while writing. Unfortunately writing math will still be slow. Martin Can't you just tap the "change language" key? One tap, and there you have your Greek keyboard. Rapper_skull Nope, I also have other keyboards, so a lot of taps are needed. Martin I'm not talking about the "Change keyboard" button. I'm talking about the "change language" key next to the space key. You can enable it in the settings ("Show language switch key"), and it lets you cycle through your language with single taps. Rapper_skull Like the default Android button, it still cycles between keyboards. Martin That's strange. I have four different keyboards installed, and the language switch button only cycles through the different languages in Gboard for me. YouNex Long press number row for (some) Greek letters ! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ad08d55f06a775a882ce447cac20fc395dae92cb2d45714f508054225311896c.jpg Rapper_skull Doesn't work for me :( YouNex Android version/GBoard version ? Rapper_skull Android 6.0.1, GBoard 6.2.18.151907649 YouNex I updated to GBoard 6.2.22 and it's gone. I think you'll need to downgrade to GBoard 6.1.x Android 7.1.1 btw YouNex As you may have noticed, the screenshot above doesn't have rounded letter keys, which means version below 6.2 YouNex My GBoard version was 6.1.71 to be exact Tomáš Petrík Can you disable all of the top rows? No suggestions, no numbers, no G button, no themes shortcut... Just make it gone. I can do that in current version. If that option is gone, I will hesitate to update. I value screen estate. mattcoz Yes Tomáš Petrík Thanks! Igor Stanić How? mattcoz Oh, I see now that it still shows a bar with everything turned off in some apps. I tried it from the search bar and it wasn't there. Sorry about that. Tomáš Petrík Sadly, the answer is no. mattcoz Right, as I mentioned in my followup reply. Jaime Andres Salame Borja I wanted to search GIFs in Whatsapp? then i believe Whatsapp has to add the search engine... :( AbbyZFresh No gif support. Back to Swiftkey. Naxx ENVY It does support gifs... press the emoji button and its at the bottom,. the app has to support them too though senor_heisenberg Awesome. I'm so glad this was an update and not a separate app. Maxr1998 "Introducing Google Type, a smart keyboard with Google Assistant, tied to your phone number, and without SMS support." Vincent Don't give them ideas.. Clawz114 "The emoji panel was causing confusion with our users, so we have seperated this from the Gboard and Google Type to it's own dedicated emoji app, Gemoji." T4rd Hope they fix the the space bar cursor moving gesture, as it rarely works for my on my 6P. Sometimes if I try it for 20-30 secs it'll eventually remember I had that feature checked and start moving the cursor, so it's basically useless. Cory S Yeah, its a little stiff. I like the way it works on Chroma. Dehaha1 I agree, it's largely useless on my Nexus 5. It usually works on my second or third attempt, however at that point it would have been faster to just tap where I needed to go. On my iPad Mini 2 using GBoard it works much better, though sadly not as flexible as what is built into the default Apple keyboard. (Though I can't give up using GBoard, the gesture typing is too useful) mattcoz Are you holding and sliding or just doing a quick swipe? T4rd Tried it both ways several times. But I see now that if I do a quick swipe, it seems to work better, but still kinda inconsistent and awkward to use. Like your finger has to already be swiping before you touch the space bar, which doesn't feel right. So I think they need to tweak this gesture to allow you to do it while holding in on the space bar for a split second before swiping at least, esp since that doesn't have any other function associated with it (at least in my config). mattcoz No, you should NOT be doing a quick swipe. You hold it down and slide your finger, don't lift it until the cursor is where you want it. If that's not working, then there's something wrong. Martin I don't know if I'm just lucky, but I got it to work on the new Gboard on every single try so far. Previously it would always bring up the "Change Keyboard" menu instead, no matter how fast or slow I tried swiping. Simon I agree this function works much better with this new update. Berkay Did they add the two new keyboard themes that were on the pixel? Badouken Yes it has the blue color schemes for standard light and dark themes. Berkay I went ahead and got the APK because I was impatient, thank you anyway :) How do I use the GIF functionality? It doesn't seem to work anywhere. JSo Only works in apps that support it. Google Messenger, Hangouts and Allo. App developers apparently have to enable it themselves Badouken Mine didn't work at first but then randomly appeared after awhile. It appears when I clicked the smile icon at the bottom, it would then show a gif button next to it. Berkay Whenever I use the emoji search, it's so laggy... But google keyboard has been laggy for me since they introduced the update where they added all those new features like one handed mode. Tiuri Elvander I saw saw a video showing that the iOS version could send little screenshots of search results. I can't find a way to do that in this version of am I missing something?? Lazyboy0172 unfortunately doesn't look like we're missing anything. whenever I search for something it shows a "share" button but just inserts the text from the result as well as http link for the search. It's not the worst, but I'd much prefer to insert it as an image, especially in apps that support the official api for image insertion from keyboard. I mean it's already there with gif search, so why not make those shared search results as pretty in my text message as they are on the keyboard? Still very happy to be able to search from keyboard though, and be able to search emoji. Goodbye, Dango. Goodbye, Swiftkey. Please keep improving, GBoard. Paul_Werner I wasn't using Swiftkey but I was just like you regarding Dango. Glad to have it a part of the built in keyboard now saf1927 The multi language support works really well with two languages. Haven't added a third yet, but now Swift Key is really obsolete for me. Christopher Robert Does it allow for keyboard size scaling? How about better prediction? Themes? yep still not a good replacement for Swiftkeye. Tuck Choate Yes, yes, and yes. They're in the settings. Good thing Swiftkeye has good autocorrect. It'd be embarrassing to make a typo that contradicts your point online. Miku is Best Vocaloid "Multiple active languages". That look a long ass time to happen. br_hermon I want to like Gboard but it's lack of secondary key functions keeps me using SwiftKey. Abhilash Bingi What do you mean by "secondary key functions"? If you mean typing symbols by long pressing alphabets, you can do it in Google Keyboard. br_hermon Thanks the heads up! I never knew that. It's disabled by default. I had to go into settings to enable it. epsiblivion not a fan of all this rebranding to G products. must be new internal management on the apps. Ben G products... like what? Except this one? Perry Mason Gmail /s Todd I really hate that they did it to their email app. I don't think I'll ever get used to it. bikrame Hey guys, how do i add that numerical line above on keyboard. JSo Settings>Preferences>Toggle Number Row bikrame There is nothing like that JSo Then maybe it didn't update for you. bikrame I just downloaded. Vorastra https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a256e9e1393428c03b73ef88560b8959247cf4df2fb8b4664a215b5763527b9a.png bikrame https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/cb2c9e011ee1cbea13883ec8e56c4afa707debc7c253dac399b7fa0841d64ae7.png Vorastra Super weird. You're missing the whole "Keys" section. bikrame May be its because i don't have stock Android ??!! Georgiy Alexandrov You downloaded it from Play Store? Then I suggest you check version number, it should be 6.0.65 bikrame ok now its going to sound super weird. I did download from play store and it says like this https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/599303b5bf88aff23f000101544e9f9f626e9d31d3a791cf557f08a8bef2ddb1.png Georgiy Alexandrov It's not really that weird, update probably not rolled out to you yet. You will get it a little bit later (or just download apk from link in article). And you should actually check app version through settings>apps>gboard (if you not seeing Gboard in apps try to look for Google Keyboard) https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/25eff26cc1692310ac42f8878e975697259b70c46702b63ed7fd373a8d67597b.png Kieron Quinn It's on staged rollout and hasn't reached you yet, use the APK Vorastra I'm not using stock android. Using an LG G4. Georgiy Alexandrov Settings > preferences > number row Alex Guitar This is mucho bueno for my Spanglish! Frisi *muy :P Frisi Bye Swiftkey. It's me or Swiftkey caused more "typos" than any other keyboard? Of course, Swiftkey would correct them, but I type better using Google's Keyboard. Now with multi-lingo support I'm more than happy. motoridersd I've been using SwiftKey for a long, long time since I have always needed two languages. I have not been using Flow since I live by the swipe to delete gesture. I love the SwiftKey prediction of emoji, I use it ALL the time, and I am very used to the layout of the keyboard. Trying Gboard for the first time, it feels odd, but it's easy to type in. It doesn't seem to always introduce the period after hitting space bar twice. Swiping the backspace key to delete a word is cumbersome because the surface is very small, so I'm missing that already. There is no emoji prediction, but the search is nice. Unfortunately it doesn't know the latest emoji like bacon, avocado or facepalm, but once they are in the recent window, this can be less of an issue. The prediction does not work in the search box, which is a shame, because searching Google without it is a PITA. Hurricane Andrew The prediction also does not work in Chrome or the Facebook search field. Big oversight. motoridersd Yeah, I use that a lot with SwiftKey. A new Gboard update just came through, wonder if they're tweaking these things. Christian yup and for this thing i still use swiftkey, is really helpfull the prediction in chrome ;) Freek Smulders This is pretty big! #NotMyPresident Why would you want an advertising company logging all your keystrokes? PVL_93_RU I'd rather trust them than my own government to do the same #NotMyPresident LOL. Okay..... /rolleyes 7-down It's in the settings. You can disable sharing of what you type. #NotMyPresident And if you believe that Google respects that, I've got a bridge to sell you. 7-down Hopefully it's the Golden Gate Bridge. I really like the way it looks. http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/ec/ec23811e3ebf097d66addd31391d2b84d094eb85cc37a9b74dec3475a722ca0c.jpg XerBlade Gboard settings > Advanced > Disable "Share snippets" (if it really bothers you that much) P.S. It never actually logs all your keystrokes, even with that enabled. Knowledgeborn Allah Yeah, I see how that could be a concern. They should've filtered the keyboard the way it is in iOS, since that would probably give a lot of people more peace of mind. For example, on iOS, you can't enter your password using Gboard for this exact reason. Whenever you have to enter a password or pin number, it automatically reverts back to the default keyboard (which doesn't store information) to prevent anything getting leaked. But, all in all, this version is pretty cool too. XerBlade ...Seriously, this isn't sending your passwords back to Google. Apple did things that way in iOS to prevent possible malicious third party keyboard replacements from taking advantage of that (which IS a concern in Android: seriously, you probably shouldn't go around installing random keyboards from people you've never heard of). This keyboard, being not-a-malicious-app and all, simply never includes anything marked as a password field in the "snippets" it sometimes [optionally] collects as statistical data for use in improving the app. Knowledgeborn Allah At least that's what they tell you... I'm not trying to sound like a conspiracy theorist or anything, but we don't really know what's happening behind the scenes. Google is an advertising company, and their job is to know as much about you as possible. Statistical data is one thing, but personal information is something different. Another thing that separates the Android version from the iOS version is that the Android version is tied to your Google account, while the one on iOS functions independently. That's how, on Android, they can share "learned words" across your Android devices. They can filter these through your devices because, since they're tied into your Google account, what you type (or at least some of it) goes through Google's servers. It's not anonymous data to just improve the app. It's data specifically about you, tied to your personal account. PVL_93_RU So when the G button is active - how do you switch languages? Do you just tap the same key? Is there a gesture like swipe the spacebar (swiftkey)? Frisi You don't have to now since it will automatically "change" as you type. PVL_93_RU I don't like that XerBlade The G button is unrelated. By default, it has multiple languages active simultaneously (so you just type and it intelligently figures out which language you're using as it goes). Or you can manually switch languages by long pressing spacebar (was already a thing in Google Keyboard). OR you can enable the dedicated language switch button in the settings (was also already a thing in Google Keyboard), which adds a button for manually switching to the left of the space bar (note the optional G button is on the left side of the suggestions pane, so again, completely unrelated). PVL_93_RU >OR you can enable the language switch button in the settings (was already a thing in Google Keyboard), which adds a button for manually switching to the left of the space bar Phew, thank god Kwetsima Maluleke Number row? Finally! Nuno G. Gboard?! What were these guys drinking?!? raazman The good stuff. tim242 Nothing good about this POS. raazman You're entitled to your own opinion. To me, the best keyboard out there just got better. tim242 Yeah, because a blank bar taking up screen real estate is so much better. I'm glad you like it. raazman What blank bar? tim242 The settings bar, above the keyboard. raazman https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2569deb1397c93e3c918c8e97290dbd8c70fafb66fa9d5277b20236aa34124a6.png Huh? What exactly are you talking about? tim242 That bar where you have suggestions. I don't use suggestions. If you disable suggestions, the bar remains as a blank bar. They do this on about every other version. raazman Ah ok, makes sense. I use the suggestions so I never had the need to remove it. Aaron Sounds like a personal problem. tim242 You sound like a blocked problem : ) Aaron Doesn't matter. You can't stop anyone from replying. Wis Ciao Swiftkey, this is soooo good - everything I wanted. Thx, Google... David Prieto What's with the emoji search? Why doesn't it return any results? JSo Emoji search is working for me. ADofCLE The number row is probably the only new feature I am going to use lol mattcoz Dedicated number row? Dedicated number row?! DEDICATED NUMBER ROW!!! Andy Roid Yes, that's what it says in the article mattcoz It sure does! Adrianus AJ Nadeak #DEDICATEDNUMBERROW yka1988 OMG finally! I just switched back to SwiftKey after months and months of using the super snappy Google Keyboard. Those were exactly the things I was missing, and especially the language features made me switch back recently. well, byebye Swiftkey, welcome back Gboard :) El Jefe this is great so now I can do GIF kb in Hangouts but only lif not via SMS. In the Google Messenger app, I can do GIF kb with SMS... I'm running latest everything 7.1.1 ahhh Jordan L I'm not seeing the G button on my Pixel XL. anyone else? I enabled it in settings. rebooting now. I also don't see any text predictions. the whole top bar is missing. EDIT: reboot fixed. XerBlade Make sure you're in an app that supports text predictions. It won't show up if you are typing in the Google search bar, for example. Bewear Emoji search not working for me. It might be because my device is set in Spanish. Scros97 A mi sí que me funciona en castellano la búsqueda de emoji! Bewear Not for me :/ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a56c197ba6b723f6ccc0ba473c4dc94277e9cac70a07f5146133052155fdc1f8.jpg Kieron Quinn I have the same issue, apparently you have to be on WiFi at least once for it to download. Shame I won't be until tomorrow. keithzg See this is when it pays to have two devices, so you set one to be a wifi hotspot, then trade off ;) Kieron Quinn My Nexus 5X IS a hotspot, because my flat wifi is broken Ashwin I've installed the app on wifi, have been on wifi the entire day and also tried the same with the new update and still the same error persists for me. What do I do? Cakefish Same but my language is English :( alessiolarva No way to search images directly from the keyboard? tim242 Great. From 41, to 72 MB running service, and laggy again uggggh Aaron Really? Not seeing any lag here. Maybe it's your phone? Would be the first time a Galaxy experienced lag... tim242 Yeah, because a Galaxy chooses which versions of Google Keyboard to lag on. *Eye roll JSo No lag here either. It's not the update. Rod Actually it's showing up as 100mb ish for me. Alex Feels like they finally fixed the Google keyboard lag. That is my only gripe with my Pixel XL ahtough that problem was also on the 6p). Cakefish "Data for emoji search is not available." What does that mean? Samson Don't know. It works for me. Cakefish What phone do you have and which Android version? I have Nougat 7.0. Samson Much appreciated update. I like it a lot! Rod This is the official Google keyboard. Samson It is now. And the problem still exists. So I had to go back to the older version of the official Google keyboard. Very disappointing. Dustin Mingo Swipe from backspace is gone :( Georgiy Alexandrov It still there, or did you mean something else? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/09a329c7a63ed9bb2bcdeec4f5376ebdb3d98d40b75e3f7e2788bf488a681485.png Dustin Mingo Setting's gone for me. I'll clear data and report back Georgiy Alexandrov That's good to hear JSo No it's not Rod It isn't. Steve Will they ever enable its auto-corrections/auto-suggestions when searching? Rocket Does anyone know what happened to picture background? JSo You mean in themes? It's still there Rocket On the old Google Keyboard you could select a picture as the theme, but it looks like its gone now. JSo It's still there for me. I don't know why it's not working for you Rocket Did you do it as an update or as a new installation?? JSo I installed the apk right over my existing app Rocket Im gonna reinstall Google Keyboard (and brave the clunky LG Keyboard) and then update to GBoard Rocket Got it working by selecting a theme and then updating. Now it's an option. Georgiy Alexandrov Working for me on 7.1 and 6.0 but not on 4.4. Well, that's weird Rocket I'm on 5.1 so maybe that has something to do with it? Corey Kinard You sure? I press the arrow on the top left of the Keyboard, press the pallet, and the first theme option for me in Gboard is the "My images" one Edit: way too late! Igor Stanić how to disable popup toolbar when g is not enabled???...it just takes up space...everything is fantastic except this freshprince_87 SwiftKey is still better Igor Stanić How to disable suggestion row ...i dont use it so it is blank...terrible Georgiy Alexandrov You can't, as far as i know tim242 Yep, they always fuck something up. I had to revert back. Igor Stanić Me too Archenuh How to you revert back this damn cancer of an app? Dave Okay, wow. This app somehow fucked up my Pixel XL. I've installed it and it always freezed and didn't let me close the keyboard anymore. So I force restarted where it got stuck. I've hold down the power button again to force restart and when it booted up I was set back to Android 7.1 (had 7.1.1) and I can't access recent apps, can get into the quick settings, have different system settings (for example it vibrates when pressing home although I had it disabled) and it doesn't get data connection. What is this? JSo I really don't think a little keyboard app could cause all that. The most that could probably happen is that the keyboard may keep force closing if you installed the wrong version but I don't think it would do all the things you said happened. Dave I don't know either. But that's how it went. Everything was working fine and after I've installed the keyboard and it kept freezing and therefore covering up half my display although I was on the homescreen I force restarted where it got stuck. One again force starting brought me to that situation I am in now. Zach Mauch LOVE LOVE LOVE the dedicated number row. I would also like the option to add a "tab" button to the keyboard. suavemezie No emoji predictions? JSo What are these emoji predictions everyone is bringing up? Georgiy Alexandrov A SwiftKey (or other keyboard) feature, something like this https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/045c7a98611e38f08413474280cb41eb8fd78121f38eae7386543f5cc4490eb2.png JSo Was this something that was shown by Google or that the GBoard on iOS has? Just seems everyone is bringing this up all of a sudden. Georgiy Alexandrov Idk, but I dont remember Gboard having this on iOS. I guess it just a popular feature that many custom keyboards have. DubeBoom While Gboard feels much faster and more fluid, there are some things I just like about Swiftkey like the easy access to ? and !. But I'll try using Gboard for a few days to see if I get used to it. JSo Turn on "Long Press For Symbols" for easy access to those. Ashish Bogawat I have that option, but with Swiftkey you don't even need to long-press. Just swipe left on the '.' key. Seems small, but is super efficient once you get used to it. mattcoz Another quick method is to swipe from the symbol key, see if that works for you. Adrianus AJ Nadeak It's not as easy on a wide phone like the Nexus 6. mattcoz True Rod Decrease the long press delay, set it to 120ms. It'll make your life easier. Arshdeep Singh Saini It doesn't install 😢 Nathan J Aww. Google Keyboard's growing up. It was always my favorite keyboard on Android, even though it lacked some features of other keyboards. It was accurate which is what I liked. "Gboard" is a downgrade. On iOS, the Gboard autocorrect is just off the wall. Microsoft's Flow Keyboard (did y'all get that yet?) is better for trace typing, but it will not learn new words. No curse words, no proper names... gotta tap that out. So I deal with Gboard since it will learn... but not from its mistakes. It might be a limitation of iOS, but Gboard on iOS is vastly inferior to Google Keyboard on Android. Coming from someone who has used both extensively. Craig Nelson I have both myself and you're right the auto correct on Gboard IOS is not as good as IOS native keyboard but I will say that the Gboard on IOS seems slightly better than the one on android when it comes to the fluidity of finding a search result and using it. Max Not a second-copy-of-the-same-app? S**t what's happened Google? mrjayviper finally catch up to iOS. Thanks google. I'll be enjoying this on my note4 as I've been doing on the Air2 and 6s+ itsatrap Its good but still no better than Swiftkey. Not even close. jl2222 ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You can perform google search in Swiftkey? Find a gif without leaving the keyboard? itsatrap Those things are extras, keyboards are for typing. Swiftkey is still far better at it. On top of that, there is this annoying bug: https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=176390 Rod I agree. Swiftkey still has the lead. Azzy Fuck, only 3 languages at a time! Luckily SwiftKey can accommodate 5, just the number I need! Rod You speak 5 languages? Not bad! steb0ne Finally NERV I am still waiting for it to include those Asian languages so I don't need to download a worse separated one. xunknownx finally! been waiting for the google keyboard to have a dedicated number row. Albin Does it record keystrokes? Rod Of course. Machine learning is a thing. Umer Farooq It now also supports Urdu swiping and suggestions. Vincent Goh Asian languages? I need English, German, and Chinese. I don't need multi languages to include Chinese, but I don't want to switch keyboard app whenever I need to type Chinese. pfmiller Might be more realistic for them to add better English and other Latin alphabet language support to the Pinyin keyboard. I can understand them not wanting to clutter up their main keyboard with various input methods. Ramiro Fernandez I noticed something, don't know if it's new to this version but pretty sure it is. The keyboard will sometimes now correct *back* one word if the next word you type changes what it would predict. So I typed "I'm feeling" but when I typed "I'm" it detected it as "on". Then after typing "feeling" it changed the "on" to "I'm". Gave me options for the two word suggestion too (see screenshot). Doesn't always happen, I guess it depends on how close I was with my gliding and how confident it was with the original prediction. I've never seen this before, but it's really clever. I wish it would take context into account better when suggesting words in general. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f788aeb53d108efe429fbde31f0cead3ef3ecba862432200ee25bd8e1eecf969.png Rod Yeah, I noticed it yersterday whilst replying to a Reddit comment. itsatrap Do you guys have this problem: https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/websearch/sxhRXvLfILk WesleySmalls Have they learned nothing from the IE6 toolbars? benjammin03 I am waiting for the google keyboard to have the swipe left to delete the last word. After using it on Swiftkey, it's impossible to use a keyboard without it. Portgas D. Ace Gboard does have this option. benjammin03 I think I tried this before, but I couldn't get used to having to start at the delete key. I'm used to being able to swipe left from anywhere. I forgot about it though, so I'm going to give it another shot since this is the only reason I still use Swiftkey. Thanks! Portgas D. Ace I used Swiftkey in the past but never gestures. So I had no idea it works differently there. Rod In Gboard, you'll need to swipe from the backspace key. But, it's more effective, as you can delete a 10,000 word text all at once. Portgas D. Ace https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/751b4dcb558130893fe4db757a19aa363e250b3b3f2f347889f55783a469ef98.png Rod Swipe horizontally from the backspace key, and you can even delete the whole text at once. Faheem Ahmed not available in 4.2+ Promethean Add Swypes select all/copy/cut/paste gestures and I'm sold, I use them a lot more than I thought and missed them from other keyboards. Jack Sparrow I find it very buggy. It shows only one result. No horizontal scrolling like on iOS. And the funny thing is, if you search for "gboard", it returns the result for slash keyboard! Is it just me or is everyone facing the issue? Rod What do you mean, horizontal scrolling? Savage Alien "Emoji have bright halo effect around them" Yeah, whose bright idea was this? It doesn't look very pretty. QeeYou i know right 😂, looks very bad in bright themes'. neonix One more new feature I noticed: you can now edit the current theme. I believe previously, you couldn't make changes once the image was set. Dobriy Her Still not available in Turkish play store keithzg Oddly enough, the Play Store is still reporting this to me as Google Keyboard, but showing the version to be 6.mumble, while if I go into Settings -> Languages & Input -> Virtual Keyboards I see Gboard. Portgas D. Ace I get it listed as Gboard the Google keyboard in the updates list and as Google keyboard in the play store listing. dylan-m So, anyone else finding the emoji keyboard uniquely irritating now? They're wasting a ridiculous amount of vertical space, they have *two rows* of tabs, and the bottom row of tabs appears where the space bar is (while the emoji key is right beside the comma key). I frequently end up looking at the plain text smileys keyboard because I happen to miss the comma key while I'm typing. (They probably shifted the keys over by a few pixels again). That would have been fine with the old keyboard because the key to go back was in the exact same place. Now you have to pause and look for it because *the entire layout suddenly changes*. Also, they only have three tiny squashed little rows for the actual emoji, which is as many rows as they have for chrome. It's completely terrible. It would not be hard to flip that first row of tabs to the top, squeeze the search button beside them (because it doesn't need to be a text box and they can probably kill a category or two), and maintain a consistent layout for the bottom row of keys. Anyway, this is the second time in six months they have made significant changes to the keyboard layout, unexpectedly screwing with peoples' muscle memory. I guess I shouldn't be surprised by Google any more, but, it's pretty bad form. Ashwin "Data for emoji search is not available" error when tryed to search emoji...Anyone else with the same error?? Even updated to 6.0.68 (first update after Gboard 6.0.65)...Still no luck...Guys, someone please help!! please Does anyone know how the f I can disable the stupid toolbar? I HATE it, it just takes up space and I'll never use it. Any drastic measure to get rid of it works for me. Archenuh I really need this as well. What the fuck is wrong with them adding that fucking stupid toolbar above the keyboard and not letting us DISABLE it?! please how to disable toolbar LOL How does active languages work? I don't get it Rod You can start writing a sentence in english and throw german words in the middle, and it will auto correct all of them according to their idioms... LOL So it only works with Latin alphabet? Rod No, those were examples. The app description on Play Store says it covers over 120 languages. LOL But I cant just write a sentence in English and then throw a word from a different language. To write anything in different language I MUST switch keyboard to that language in order to use that alphabet Rod I have English and Brazilian portuguese set, and I can start a sentence in portuguese, throw in some english words and finish in portuguese, and it will auto-correct all the words automatically. I don't need to tinker with anything at all. Just like in Swiftkey. LOL That's because Brazilian uses Latin alphabet. Its impossible to type a word in a different language if it's not Latin Rod Oh, I never tried another language that doesn't use latim alphabet. My bad. Scorpiax7 How does the "multiple active languages" thing works? i need an explanation, please -.- <3 Dmytro Gulivatyy If you have multiple similar languages installed you can type in both without switching and it will understand which one you meant. It should display the languages that are used on the spacebar key below. Rod You can start writing a sentence in english and throw german words in the middle, and it will auto correct all of them according to their idioms. Dmytro Gulivatyy Does anyone know why we're getting it so late? I remember people protecting Google not releasing it on Android because we had G Now on tap but I'm confused now. Mako g now on tap is somewhat hidden in Pixels, so this is a good alternative Dmytro Gulivatyy I know and I agree, but why hold out for months before finally releasing it here kinda saying "Hey, you guys can have it too, don't worry we haven't forgotten." Just feels like it. Mako yeah, I really don't know why it took so long Dmytro Gulivatyy Less resources? Harder to code for? I mean it's their OS. Maybe they didn't care enough because it's easier to search for something with the search bar always accessible, GNow on tap here, and they weren't in such a hurry. But now they come out saying this is a better way. Sometimes i cant understand their behavior. pfmiller Android already has plenty of easy ways to access Google search, so it probably wasn't a big priority. Mwikarago Christian Why doesn't auto suggestion work in chrome search bar? Any idea? Dmytro Gulivatyy It's always been like that. I don't know for sure if i'm right but i think it's because they don't want to mess up your query because it's a browser address field. Same goes for the Google search bar. They think you will want full control over what you're typing because it can get technical, unlike the usual chats you have with people in chat apps. It sometimes offers predictions itself but not always. One of the reasons i'm still with SwiftKey. Mwikarago Christian That's a weird decision on their part. The only time I need autocorrection is in the address /search bar as I usually search using recurring words. That's also the reason I'll stick with SwiftKey Dmytro Gulivatyy Yes, it's been discussed times and times again and even listed as a bug https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=176390 but i personally don't think it's one, they would've fixed it a long time ago. For what its worth i don't understand their reasoning either, you can still type and have it write what you meant and not autocorrect it but i also have other reasons to stick with SwiftKey(one being its better at autocorrecting something when GBoard thinks it was just gibberish and has no clue) but it's getting better and has its charm too. marclee Yes it has been always like this.. I kind of understand why Google wants autocorrect disabled in chrome address bar (not agree tho), I just can't understand it is disabled in Google search bar and YouTube..... Rod That's disabled in the app. Someone on Reddit revealed the code. Pedro Diego Fernández It seems I'm the only one having problems with the keyboard...sometimes I glide I can see it's writing the word I want but when I finish it just adds a letter... and the multiple active languages is too funky to use... had to switch back to aosp :( Navin Govindani Not a big fan of the initial release as it has many problems with Spanish, doesn't suggest anything with "ñ", hell it even tries to autocorrect anything I type with it, not to mention, the occasional lag, I understand it's an initial release but please get your shit together team! MikeOxlong The versions available on apkmirror are old (6.0.65). I currently have 6.0.69 on my 6p and pixel XL direct from the play store... Rod Contact Artem, maybe you can share your apk with them? SyCoREAPER Why does the Google Keyboard fdiffer from the AOSP one? Rod AOSP version is outdated and missing the newer features. It's a bare-bones version. SyCoREAPER Aosp in my opinion is functionally superior with the long press symbols for every key Rod That's also present in Gboard. SyCoREAPER Thanks that's interesting and must be new. Wasmt there a few months ago when I last tried it. pfmiller That's an option in Gboard SyCoREAPER Thanks that's interesting and must be new. Wasmt there a few months ago when I last tried it s427 I think I'll make the switch from Swype to Gboard for good now. The only thing still missing IMO are the gesture shortcuts (copy, cut, paste, select all, change capitalization), which are super useful in Swype. So, GOOGLE IF YOU'RE LISTENING YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO! dk mke That and the exclamation and question mark short cuts as well. By far the best features of any keyboard IMO. It's why I keep going back. Rod As a long-time Swiftkey user, I deeply miss the punctuation auto-spacing. drcaveman Anyone else having the GBoard just randomly stop accepting input? I fix it by hiding and clicking the text input box again. Seems to happen more frequently in messaging apps. freshprince_87 SwiftKey is still way better than this new Google keyboard. First of all, SwiftKey is better with word predictions. Secondly, SwiftKey has emoji predictions and Google keyboard does not. And lastly, the SwiftKey emoji list of emojis scrolls down📜 very smooth and fast. But instead in the Google Keyboard that same emoji list scrolls through multiple horizontal pages instead. It's very slow and takes forever if you are texting. Mace Moneta Still no control, alt or tab key (even just the option in advanced setting would be nice), which is annoying for those of us that ssh into systems. marrecar Ok I updated the app this morning and it completely broke it. No words show up on prediction bar, double space doesn't add a dot, can't delete by swiping to the left, can't move the cursor by swiping the spacebar. Plus the emoji menu looks awful. Does anyone have the same problem? I tried deleting data first, didn't work, then I replaced it with stock version, updated and still the same. obk88 very intrigued by gboard used it for 5 days went back to swiftkey...typing is just more effortless on swfitkey. Prediction is better on swiftkey, no suggestions in chrome or other apps is really annoying, gliding isnt as smooth and better emoji experience on swiftkey...google is going in the right direction but this app still needs work...for now im back on swfitkey but keeping an eye on gboard for sure Christian Wagner Jr Still too large of a keyboard. I have a Nexus 6P and with it on its smallest setting, the keyboard and the box above it take up just under half my screen! SE.Quence so what? just resize it in settings Christian Wagner Jr I did. Its set to the smallest setting. Went thru all the settings as well. If they only gave the option to make it smaller by one or 2 more sizes, I would dump swiftkey for this no problem. Not all of us have donut fingers and need keys THAT large SE.Quence Yep, I can agree that some of other keyboards can be smaller when set to smallest size. But setting GKB to lowest height is pretty decent IMO. Abhipsa Banerjee On Clicking the search emoji area it shows "data for emoji search is not available".. now i don't understand why. Can u help me with this? Anon Imus You may need to be connected to wi-fi the first time you want to use this feature Abhipsa Banerjee On Clicking the search emoji area it shows "data for emoji search is not available".. now i don't understand why. Anon Imus You may need to be connected to wi-fi the first time you want to use this feature sachouba It only took Google 3 years to add some features available on Samsung's keyboard and SwiftKey. And Google fans sound astonished... patrick yes i had the numbers row on my S4 stock samsung keyboard. but as far as autocorrection, i always found Google keyboard to be more accurate. SE.Quence Testing new GBoard on my 2 Nexus devices. Both running 7.1.1. Dictionary sync doesnt work even when account is set and sync was forced manually. By some reason, GBoard is not presented in Google sync settings (Accounts - Google) but IDK whether it should be here. Who else is facing this? Đức Thành I've been using the APK since a few days ago and autocorrection is still as horrible as ever, especially for Vietnamese. There's no options to set the aggressiveness level of autocorrection, and it's a pain in the neck to hit backspace multiple times for every sentence I type just to go back and fix the incorrectly autocorrected words. Not to mention Gboard now tries to autocorrects whole compound words and phrases, and every time I want to say: "Yo Google keyboard, I appreciate the effort but honestly you are not doing that well since you don't know the language or how I type that well, and your ultra aggressiveness in helping me is creating more trouble than it solves, so could you stop?" In the end just now I had to turn off autocorrection altogether, and now I have to face the problem of not having autocorrection for either language. I wish there were some middle grounds, but Google is too stubbornly extreme in its ways sometimes. Sigh. dhamp2g Vietnamese? ?? Honestly dude, English only ..... LMAO it corrects English well 😂😂 Đức Thành I'm afraid I don't fully comprehend what you mean. Yes it autocorrects English very well, but it has also started supporting autocorrection for Vietnamese since Google Keyboard 5.0, and that's my native language so there's nothing wrong with using that, and since the app itself officially supports the language... Arrgh forget it, you won't get it anyway. dhamp2g I understand , I was just saying all us english speaking folk only car about english problems LMAO :) mizrulez I'm not sure if it's just me, but I can't turn off the keypress pop-up in the latest update. I tried deleting data, but the option is still not there. I find the popups extremely annoying. 😏 ggggg Something extraordinary happened. Google updated Google Keyboard instead of creating another keyboard App. mwolverine i wish it would show suggestions when searching in google apps. I usually end up going back to swype because of this. Usman Nagi Only reason I am not upgrading is that I miss the no key delay feature. Is there any way to enable in this current build? It slows my typing down and I only type better with popups. Itchy_Robot Why don't they just put Google Assistant into this keyboard? Renan At least that hideous G button is optional tigerberry Oh hey, finally there's gesture typing for Hungarian! It only took... well, how many years? Too many, considering that other keyboards, even OEM keyboards have been able to do it since ages. And lemme check... yep, still no gesture typing for Japanese in QUERTY mode. Come on Google, even Huawei's keyboard can do it! (I miss the Xperia keyboard. :( I wish it was available for non-Sony phones...) Gwaur I wish there was a way to completely hide the extra row where that G icon is. I found a setting for hiding the icon but the row stayed. It's a goddamn waste of space for someone who's not gonna use it. Fahad Ahmed Why there's no Chinese language included??? That's disappointing. Természetjáró Gayboard. Sorry, I'll show myself out... Patel Nisha I would be happy with a backspace key! Or better still, when using a stylus, thus knowing I went to each letter precisely when swaping, the damn thing would input my entry versus some substitute word! Marco Reali I love GBOARD but two things are very very frustrating: 1. There is no suggestion bar when typing in Chrome. 2. The language switch takes to long to recognise which language I'm typing. I wish they woul reinstate the button for those who want that. I switch language pretty often and I find it horrible to have to re-type words over and over before it's in the right language. WestIndiesKING anyone else getting a little bit of lag when you first start it up after a while of not pulling up the keyboard? I am getting 1-3 seconds of lag before it starts only if i havent used it in a while, after that it flies. Pixel XL 128gb Daddyo Gordon Am I the only one who feels the google keyboard has gotten bloated and too big? There should be an option to keep it at one language, as pioneered by monolingual on the mac (gets rid of a couple Gb of unused languages that waste storage).

"Our mission is to make the dream of personal flight a reality. We believe when everyone has access to personal flight, a new, limitless world of opportunity will open up to them," said a statement on the website of the Kitty Hawk company, based in Google's home town of Mountain View, California. "Today we're announcing our first prototype of The Flyer, a personal flying machine that will become available for sale by the end of 2017." The video showed the single-seat aircraft -- with two pontoons and a spider web-like platform -- taking off from a lake at an undisclosed location and hovering above the water, where it is meant to be used. The craft, propelled by eight rotors, takes off and lands vertically, like a helicopter. It is said to weigh about 220 pounds (100 kilograms) and fly at speeds up to 25 miles per hour (40 kph). and can hover at 15 feet (4.5 meters) high. The company describes the Flyer as "a new, all-electric aircraft," which is "safe, tested and legal to operate in the United States in uncongested areas" under US federal regulations for ultralight aircraft. No pilot's license is required, and two hours' training is said to be all that is needed. The website offered few details about the company, but several reports in recent months have said Page has poured millions of dollars into Kitty Hawk and another electric car startup. Kitty Hawk president Sebastian Thrun, a Stanford University computer science professor who has been called the father of Google's self-driving car, tweeted: "Changing the future of personal transportation. Join us @kittyhawkcorp to get information about #theFlyer prototype." The company announced it was offering three-year "memberships" for $100 to be placed on a waiting list and to get a discount on the price of the new transporter. The price is to be announced later this year. - Limited details - The startup offered only limited details about the company. An email response to an AFP query said the lead engineers were Cameron Robertson and Todd Reichert, who created a startup called Aerovelo which aims to produce the fastest human-powered vehicle. Kitty Hawk said the flyer going on sale later this year will have a different design than the prototype. A blog post by writer Cimeron Morrissey, who took the flyer for a test run, offered some clues on how it feels. "The prototype looks and feels a lot like a flying motorcycle. You mount the seat and lean forward, just like you would on a bike," she wrote. "I feel light and ecstatic and utterly free. This is just like my flying dreams!" Several other companies, including European conglomerate Airbus, have been working on similar flying machines. Tweet MH370 'mostly likely' lies north of search zone: experts Sydney (AFP) April 21, 2017 Missing flight MH370 "most likely" lies north of a former search zone in the remote Indian Ocean, Australian authorities said Friday, in a new report that offers hope the plane may one day be found.

By Charlotte Hilton Andersen | Apr 26, 2017           Google Hate heading to the computer to check every single step of a recipe? Same. But starting today, home cooks can get some high-tech help courtesy of Google Home's new feature that reads each step out loud to you as you cook. So no more cookie dough on your keyboard!  Once you find the recipe you want (there are about five million to choose from), you can send the recipe to your Google Home device, and it will walk you through it, step by step. Google will also answer any questions you have along the way. For instance, you can ask "Okay Google, what does sauté mean?" or "Okay Google, what is a substitute for butter?" or "How many grams of protein is in one serving?" or even "Okay Google, why does my milk smell funny?" (Or not. It can't solve every cooking problem.) You can also ask your Google Home to play your favorite playlist or podcast while you cook—a great feature for people who are good at multitasking or who just want to listen to more than an automated voice. (More: How to Use Google Home to Hit Your Health Goals) It's not just Google that's trying to make mealtime a little easier. If you have Amazon, Alexa can provide the same type of recipe services through Allrecipes.com. As a bonus, Alexa will even read you the reviews so you can make adjustments on the fly. (There's nothing like reading a five-star review that starts "I love this recipe but only after changing every ingredient in it!") These tools are a godsend for those tired of switching between browser tabs, trying to keep the phone from going to sleep mid-recipe, or dropping their phone in their pancake batter. Having a technological cooking assistant is pretty genius—kind of like having your mom helping you cook, except with 50 percent less judgment and no commentary about your life choices. (Maybe that will come in a later update?) "Okay, Google, what's for dinner?"

A central feature in the new Google Earth is Voyager. Google has partnered with such groups as the BBC and NASA to add video clips, photos, and text narratives to three-dimensional representations of particular locations. Sean Askay, engineering manager with Google Earth, demonstrates features displayed in the background. The mapping service is becoming more of a tool for adventure. ASSOCIATED PRESS Enlarge The Jane Goodall Institute, for instance, lets you journey to spots in Tanzania that inspired its founding chimpanzee expert. You also can get overlays of chimpanzee ranges and compare imagery from 2005 and 2014 to see the effects of forest restoration efforts. The producers of “Sesame Street” show off Muppets from co-productions around the world; the map shows where the Muppets live and offer stories about the region and its culture. Separately, a new “I’m Feeling Lucky” feature takes you to a location selected at random. Google Earth is highlighting some 20,000 lesser-known destinations — the kinds of places locals might frequent or know about, such as the Indonesian island of Bunaken, part of a national marine park. Google Earth used to be the place to go to for satellite views and 3-D images stitched together from aerial fly-bys.  A software download was required, limiting its use. Google Maps has incorporated many of those features, making Google Earth even less necessary. The update is about giving you a reason to use Google Earth again. Google says that while Maps is about getting you to a destination, Earth is about immersing you there, or “getting lost.” With the update, Google Earth now works on Google’s Chrome browsers for desktops. It still requires an app for phones and tablets because of the heavy graphics involved; Google is rolling out updates for Android, but there’s no Google Earth app for iPhones or iPads yet. Some older features still will require a software download on desktops. That includes maps of Mars and the moon through a partnership with NASA. Google also announced an update to a virtual-reality version of Google Earth. It now works with Facebook’s Oculus Rift, not just the HTC Vive. But it won’t work with cheaper, phone-based VR systems, such as Google’s Daydream and Samsung’s Gear VR.

The changes have been in the works for four months, but Google hadn’t publicly discussed most of them until now. The announcement in a blog post Tuesday reflects Google’s confidence in a new screening system designed to reduce the chances that its influential search engine will highlight untrue stories about people and events, a phenomenon commonly referred to as “fake news.” “It’s not a problem that is going to go all the way to zero, but we now think we can stay a step ahead of things,” said Ben Gomes, Google’s vice president of engineering for search. Besides taking steps to block fake news from appearing in its search results, Google also has reprogrammed a popular feature that automatically tries to predict what a person is looking for as a search request is being typed. The tool, called “autocomplete,” has been overhauled to omit derogatory suggestions, such as “are women evil,” or recommendations that promote violence. Google also is adding a feedback option that will enable users to complain about objectionable autocomplete suggestions so a human can review the wording. Facebook, where fake news stories and other hoaxes have widely circulated on its social network, also has been trying to stem the tide of misleading information by working with the Associated Press and other news organizations to review suspect stories and set the record straight when warranted. Facebook also has provided its nearly 2 billion users ways to identify posts believed to contain false information, something that Google is now allowing users of its search engine to do for some of the news snippets featured in its results. Google began attacking fake news in late December after several embarrassing examples of misleading information appeared near the top of its search engine. Among other things, Google’s search engine pointed to a website that incorrectly reported then President-elect Donald Trump had won the popular vote in the U.S. election, that President Barack Obama was planning a coup, and that the Holocaust never occurred during World War II. Only about 0.25 percent of Google’s search results were being polluted with falsehoods, Mr. Gomes said. But that was enough to threaten the integrity of a search engine that processes billions of search requests per day largely because it is widely regarded as the Internet’s most authoritative source of information.

Clash of Clans is one of the most popular games on Android and iOS and has been for years, even though Clash Royale is stealing some of its players. With millions of downloads on each platform, many will need to know how to transfer their account. Read: Clash of Clans Hacks: 3 Things You Should Know One question we keep getting is regarding how to transfer the game from one phone to another. Since everything is server side with the developer, Supercell, it isn’t just a copy/paste job. However, moving your Clash of Clans progress from one phone to another, playing on a second tablet, or switching from Android to an iPhone and more. It all can be done, so watch the quick video guide below. To be specific, this guide is how to transfer a Clash of Clans village to a new Android device, and we’ll briefly mention iOS and Game Center as well. You’ll need to download Clash of Clans on your new phone or tablet, sign into Google Games (or Apple’s Game Center) and you’re nearly done. We can even skip the tutorial now, and get right into the transfer. Being able to play Clash of Clans on my phone while out and about or while sitting on the couch, then picking up right where I left off on my tablet is an awesome feature. The entire experience is seamless, and very consistent. Being cross-platform also helps, because you can easily transfer from iOS to Android as well, or vice-versa. Meaning you can play the same village on you Android phone and iPad, switch to new devices and more. Instructions With iOS and Game Center you’ll need a device linking code, but overall the process is still extremely easy and only takes a few moments, however, you’ll need both devices side by side to enter the code. More on that below. With Android, transferring your Clash of Clans game information couldn’t be easier thanks to Google Play Games, and Google+. All you have to do is sync or sign-into Google Games (or Google+) inside the game and it transfers the data over and saves it. Download Clash of Clans on your new smartphone or tablet, then follow the steps from the video below. It’s worth mentioning that if you buy gems on the newly loaded game, or progress past a level 4 Town Hall, you can’t transfer your game data. So keep that in mind. Plus, who would want to start all over again anyways? Read: Clash of Clans May Update: What to Know The video below was filmed with an older version of the game, but very similar options and settings apply here in 2016. The steps are also slightly different for iOS. As you can see from the video above, it all takes under a minute. Simply hit the three gears “settings” button near the bottom right of the display, and connect to Google Games by hitting the “Google+ Sign-in” button, or saying ok to the Google Games popup. Once you connect to Google on the new device it will automatically sign you into Google Play Games, and find your existing game data. You’ll get a notification asking if you’d like to transfer your base, then just go ahead and select yes. Make sure it says the correct village Town Hall level before clicking Yes. Use caution, and make sure it’s loading the correct game. If you’ve started multiple different villages Google Games may have the wrong one backed up. If this for some reason doesn’t work head into settings > accounts > Google > and tap on your Google account. From here you’ll want to make sure your phone is syncing data to Google. Make sure Google+ and Google App Data sync is enabled, and you’re all set. Then try the steps from the video one more time. I used the steps above to transfer my game data from a Galaxy S4 when I first started playing, to multiple devices I use today. Currently I play Clash on the Note 5, Galaxy S7 Edge, and Pixel C tablet. All the same village. Being able to easily transfer the entire game in seconds, and enjoy the same awesome experience on an array of devices, is pretty awesome. As for iOS, the steps are somewhat different. Rather than doing all the sync options above, you’ll need to get a code from the “Old Device, New Device” pop-up from the video above. On an old device like the iPhone 5s hit settings and select “Old Device” and write down the code provided, or keep it nearby. Now, download and open Clash of Clans on a new iPhone 6s or iPad Mini, select “New Device” and enter the code provided. This will transfer the game over on iOS. Users have 5 minutes to enter the code, so don’t waste time. The village will now be on both devices. Uninstall the game on your old phone, or play on both, it’s up to you. The same steps apply to add a village from your iPhone to an iPad to play on both. Again, recent updates in 2016 could have changed this, but the steps remain about the same. This same process also works for switching Clash of Clans from Android to iPhone, or from iPhone to Android. The code method is the safest and easiest choice. If you run into problems, below are some helpful tips. If possible, write down your username, TH level, experience level, Clan name, and even your Clan tag #. This all can be helpful for the Supercell support team in locating a lost or missing village in case of problems. And yes, they can help users recover a lost base, but it may take more than a few days for a reply.

The game has yet to launch on Windows Phone, but it could in the near future. More details regarding transferring your village and game can also be found from the developers forum.

I haven’t been able to play since the update and it’s pretty much left me with withdrawal symptoms. the need to upgrade, research, donate to my muchly needing clan members has really got to me. that much so Iv had to start a new base just to be involved. im now th7 already without spending a penny. i’v kinda rushed my way there because from being half way through th9 with a strong defensive base I’m missing the troops I was used to cooking and attacking with. some of my clan are close behind me due to new updates with th holding more loot plus all the other game changing updates. I won’t be spending ££ on the Base I have had to inconveniently resort to I must say. but if you can help me with recovering my official well earned 1 of a kind strategic th9 profile then il be happy to spend my hard earned money on starting some well needed upgrades that are well over due. i also can not remember the right google play details to transfer it to any other device. i know everything else that can prove that it’s my property ie (email address for payments I have made from, clan members etc) please SUPERCELL I need your help to recover or transfer to me. thanks in advance. anybody else having the same problem? advice much appreciated! 01/17/2016 brendon taylor Reply a Taylor thing is my Base that is being deprived of attention. hate seeing attackers steal from the always full collectors without any bombs going off or x bows doing their job :( take your time to have a look, even join my clan if your in need of clan. 01/26/2016 Annhfranklin Reply 0=0006my co-worker’s aunt makes $83 hourly on the internet .

My IPad was stolen so obviously I can’t sign in on the old device and support keep asking for more and more things. Hopefully they get it sorted soon. 02/22/2016 Matthew Jackson Reply They need your username, clan name, exact Xp then a screenshot of your first gem ever purchase if you made any. Other things that help are knowing where and when you first loaded the game or other specifics. I hope this helps you and you get your base back like I hope to. 02/24/2016 Matthew Jackson Reply Hey Brendon. I feel your pain and more. Try playing for years then just when they finally make a significant upgrade including finally level 11 Town hall you go and lose your iPad. Help won’t let me into my base even after sending the information and my first purchase because it doesn’t match with their records apparently. Starting again would be horrible. When you have max level defenses and troops almost going back to level one Is a crushing blow. So I might have to retire. It will give me so much time for other things and with a busy job maybe it is for the best. 02/27/2016 Cienna Reply You care supposed to be able to get your game back on your own if you saved it like supercell recommends. If you saved it on Game Center while you played it on your iOS device then log into Game Center on your new IOS device first. You should see coc listed as one of your games. Now download and install coc. Follow prompts and it will ask you to load your old game. If you saved it on android with Google+ or google play your new android device will give you option to sign into that and load old village. If your new device is android and old was iOS or was IOS and now Android you have to link them first through the CoC game settings to get your village to load. If you don’t have your old device and didn’t link them but did save them only way I know is to find someone who has a device same as your old type of OS and doesn’t play clash of clans to allow you to download the game on their device. For iOS Sign out of their Game Center and then sign into Game Center with your account. Download CoC and once your game is up link it to Android device. For Android use their phone to load CoC and after sign in with your google play and link your new IOS. Once done they can just delete CoC from their device. I have also used an emulator for Android called Blue Stacks on a computer and then linked an IOS device. If you never saved your game then supercell is only one who can help. 03/04/2016 Rosie Reply How can I transfer my y clash of clans from my iPhone 5s to an iPhone 6s?

Google has made structural changes in Search that include improvements in ranking, easier ways for people to provide direct feedback, and greater transparency around how Search works. To help prevent the spread of offensive or misleading content that has been known to surface in a small subset of queries, Google has improved its evaluation methods and made algorithmic updates that surface more authoritative content. As part of the process, Google is taking feedback from real people who assess the quality of Google's search results and give their feedback on our experiments. These ratings don't determine individual page rankings, but are used to help them gather data on the quality of our results and identify areas for improvement. Last month, Google updated its Search Quality Rater Guidelines to provide more detailed examples of low-quality webpage for raters to appropriately flag, which can include misleading information, unexpected offensive results and unsupported conspiracy theories. These guidelines are expected to help the algorithms in demoting such low-quality content and help make additional improvements over time. Google uses hundreds of signals to determine which results are shown for a given query-from the freshness of the content, to the number of times user search queries appear on the page. These signals have been adjusted to help surface more authoritative pages and demote low-quality content. In order to bring greater transparency, Google recently updated its 'How Search Works' site to provide more information to users and website owners about the technology behind Search.

Google has made structural changes in Search that include improvements in ranking, easier ways for people to provide direct feedback, and greater transparency around how Search works. To help prevent the spread of offensive or misleading content that has been known to surface in a small subset of queries, Google has improved its evaluation methods and made algorithmic updates that surface more authoritative content. As part of the process, Google is taking feedback from real people who assess the quality of Google's search results and give their feedback on our experiments. These ratings don't determine individual page rankings but are used to help them gather data on the quality of our results and identify areas for improvement. Last month, Google updated its Search Quality Rater Guidelines to provide more detailed examples of the low-quality web page for raters to appropriately flag, which can include misleading information, unexpected offensive results and unsupported conspiracy theories. These guidelines are expected to help the algorithms in demoting such low-quality content and help make additional improvements over time. Google uses hundreds of signals to determine which results are shown for a given query from the freshness of the content, to the number of times user search queries appear on the page. These signals have been adjusted to help surface more authoritative pages and demote low-quality content. In order to bring greater transparency, Google recently updated its 'How Search Works' site to provide more information to users and website owners about the technology behind Search. The site includes a description of how Google ranking systems sort through hundreds of billions of pages to return your results, as well as an overview of our user testing process. In addition, Google has published updates to its policy to the Help Center so anyone can learn more about Autocomplete and Google's approach to removals.

The Google Trips app now lets you manually update a trip with new details on flight, hotel, car, and restaurant reservations. Just tap the “+” button in the bottom right corner of the Reservations section and enter your info, like a flight number or name of your car rental. Also included is a section for free-form notes if you’d prefer to go that route. Google Trips is also gaining support train and bus reservations. All of your past and upcoming train and bus rides will be organized for you in the app alongside your flight, hotel, car, and restaurant reservations. Finally, if you’d like to share the reservation details of a trip, you can do so by tapping the arrow button in the Reservations tab. The recipient will get an email with all of your details and see them in the app, too. These are some nice additions to the Google Trips app. Lots of folks still travel by bus and train, so it’s good that those travel methods are finally included, and the ability to quickly share your reservation info can be helpful if you’ve traveling with friends that aren’t using the app or you want to keep your loved ones up-to-date on your travel.

Saudi Arabia's new leadership will push forward efforts to diversify the growing but oil-dependent economy, while easing procedures for investors, senior officials said. The annual event, organised by Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority (SAGIA, brings together high-ranking Saudi officials with world business leaders. AFP PHOTO / FAYEZ NURELDINE (Photo credit should read FAYEZ NURELDINE/AFP/Getty Images)    Google Has Stopped Being Cool Mytheos Holt Policy Analyst 11:59 PM 04/26/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP 5618640 Once upon a time, there was a search engine with a funny name and big dreams. After it became renowned for its accuracy and unpredictable algorithms, its creators decided to turn it into a company, with the charmingly off-beat slogan “don’t be evil.” And for a certain generation of internet users, of whom this author is a member, that search engine – Google — lived up to that slogan for many years. When Hollywood tried to save their business model by strangling internet freedom with the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), who stopped them? Google. When freelance critics and video journalists needed a platform for their speech, who kept YouTube’s lights on? Google. In short, anytime the unregulated, anarchic nature of the internet was threatened, who was there, ready to hold back the tyrants? Google. Oh, how the mighty have fallen. Now, after years of fighting stubbornly for free speech and free access to information for every internet user, Google has reversed course and apparently decided it wants to be every internet user’s uncool, hectoring, preachy, Leftist mom. The most recent example of this turn toward HR Department-style busybody behavior by the search giant would be their introduction of the cringeworthy “Internet Citizens” project. According to Ars Technica, “Internet Citizens” appears to be a series of workshops on such trendy topics of Left-wing moral panic as “fake news” (read: news that points out inconvenient facts for the Left), “hate speech” (read: arguments the Left is too scared to refute), and any number of other things. As described on the project’s own website, it aims to teach teens how to “get creative with our hosts and guest YouTuber,” “stay resilient and confident online and make negativity bounce,” “use video to find your voice and bring people together,” “navigate social media, check facts and (sic) escape social bubbles,” “discover how to use online tools responsibly,” and “not do drugs because drugs are NOT totally radical, dudes!” Okay, I made that last one up, but given the insufferably cheery, faux-cool corporate-speak that dominates the rest of the project’s “goals,” would you be surprised? Even more hilariously, the founder of the project is named (get this) Nadir. Which is fitting because this project might well be the… well, nadir of Google’s attempts to turn itself into a social policeman through YouTube. And while the “Internet Citizens” project is just the most easily mockable incarnation of that tendency, make no mistake, it’s been going for ages. Ever since Google debuted its “YouTube Heroes” project last year, which effectively turned moderation of the video streaming service over to totally unvetted keyboard warriors, and then began stripping ad revenue from videos which criticized the Left, the company has been backsliding on its previous commitment to free speech and an unfettered internet. In fact, just last month, YouTube debuted a “Restricted Mode” designed to filter out family-unfriendly content, which somehow managed to offend literally everyone with any political opinion with what it excluded. And it’s not just YouTube. Google is now in the process of trying to purge ads on its homepage of “hate speech,” a category so subjective and intrinsically useless that only your irritating little cousin with a gender studies degree could love it. Among the categories covered by this new “hate speech” policy is “disparaging speech against groups like immigrants and refugees.” You know, because that isn’t shutting out serious debate or anything. Fortunately, conservatives have started noticing this blatant attempt to weaponized one of the internet’s biggest giants against them. And given the overwhelmingly Leftist tilt of modern Silicon Valley companies, perhaps it was inevitable. But to see Google, once thought to be the pinnacle of cool, the ultimate anti-censor, the voice of the young and the internet savvy, turn into an enforcer for everything humorless, smug, hysterical, and basic in society is a special sort of tragedy. One only hopes that future generations of internet pioneers will take a lesson from their behavior – that is, if the criticism Google rightly endures for enlisting in the thought police isn’t scrubbed from the internet by Google itself.

Dish’s AirTV mimics the experience of watching cable or satellite where it is convenient to go to a guide and scroll through the local and premium channels to find what you want to watch. The AirTV’s raison d’être is as a Sling TV device. Sling TV offers live basic cable/satellite TV channels from ESPN to Comedy Central, Food TV. Dish calls the streaming service app “a la carte TV” as it offers basic cable stations for as little as $20 per month with additional channels available for $5 per category, and premiums—HBO, STARZ, Showtime and Cinemax running $10 or $15. Part of the over-the-top (streaming) service’s appeal is that channels can be added or dropped at any time and users can take time out of their subscription. Unlike most home theater devices available, AirTV has eschewed the piano black exterior for white and blue. It stuck out among the black devices in my media cabinet. The sky blue and white remote is also a standout among my remotes; its large buttons and icons reminiscent of a toddler’s first tech toy. Clearly, it is designed to be easy for even the most technologically challenged user. The remote is meant to be the only remote you’ll need. During setup, it asked if I wanted to set it up to control my TV and Audio receiver. I went through the setup and all seemed to test okay, but it doesn’t work when playing videos. It’s obviously choosing the wrong code for the TV, but after several attempts to force it to try new codes, it still can’t control the volume when watching videos. At the heart of the AirTV’s operating system is the latest version of Android TV. It starts with the typical new Android TV setup. If you have an Android phone, you can open the Google app and say “set up my device.” This adds your Google account to the AirTV as well as setting up the WiFi connection. Unlike setting up a new Roku TV that automatically downloads your channels when you sign in, the AirTV Android TV setup only adds your Google account details. The AirTV comes pre-loaded with Sling TV, Netflix, Google Play Movies and Music apps, and YouTube. Chromecast is built-in for streaming from smart phones, tablets and the Chrome web browser on a computer and adds more options without adding more apps. Because the AirTV is a full Android TV, and can download any compatible apps from the Google Play app store including Hulu, Plex, Vudu, Spotify and more. Some apps are easier to find in the Google Play store when using a web browser where you can choose to download the app to the AirTV. Note that although the NVIDIA Shield is an Android TV, it has a special agreement to include the Amazon Video app. Amazon is not available on AirTV. The AirTV’s specialty is less in the Android TV apps, and more in combining Sling TV with local TV programming. To get the local channels requires an antenna (or basic cable) connected to the optional AirTV adapter (tuner). The AirTV detects when an antenna and adapter are connected and asks if you want to scan for channels. The local channels are then added to the Sling TV channel guide and to Sling TV’s My TV menu. Clicking on the local channels in the guide shows what is on now along with what shows are upcoming. Currently the AirTV doesn’t support Sling TV’s Cloud DVR functionality, but surely it will be rolled out soon. Once signed into Netflix, a list of recommended programs and shows to continue watching is also added to the My TV menu. The My TV menu an easy way to quickly get to a variety of content without going through several menus. The AirTV’s guide is not the first to consolidate content from various sources. Xbox’s OneGuide combines online content with your cable or satellite guide when it is connected to your TV provider’s receiver. The OneGuide uses a grid format similar to the typical Electronic Program Guide. Sling TV uses a horizontal carousel of channels and TV shows instead of a grid guide. The Sling TV app has another menu that displays what’s “on now” to choose live TV programs. Unfortunately, it doesn’t include the local channels so you can’t peruse all of the content options available when you sit down to watch. While the current local TV is listed in the Sling TV guide, it would be nice to also see it in the menu where I look when I just want to “see what’s on TV.” AirTV supports 1080p HD and 4K Ultra HD streaming and Dolby Digital/Dolby Digital Plus audio formats. The AirTV Player bundle that includes the (antenna) Adapter is $130. An antenna is not included. The AirTV player alone is $100. Both options come with $50 of SlingTV program credits. For a limited time starting April 25, 2017, Dish is offering deals on the Air TV if you pay for your Sling TV subscription in advance. To get the AirTV player and Adapter for $50: prepay 3 months of basic Sling TV service ($20 and over), or prepay for months of service if your monthly payment is between $15-$20, or prepay six months of service if your payment is under $15.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Google-Branded Wireless Headphones With Noise Canceling Show Up at the FCC – Images By Rafia Shaikh 8 hours ago 12Shares Share Tweet Submit After launching the Pixel duo last year, Google appears to be on its way to becoming more than just the developer and “maintainer” of Android. The search giant is now apparently following its archenemy and working to release its own audio accessories. While we hadn’t heard anything about it before, a set of Google-branded headphones has just appeared in a new FCC filing. Google-branded wireless headphones show up at FCC A pair of Google-made headphones were spotted at the Federal Communications Commissions this morning with several pictures, specs, and more details tagging along. The audio accessory is named as “Bluetooth and ANC headphone,” featuring an over-the-ear design that’s anything but innovative. Related These Experimental Nighttime Photos Clicked with Nexus 6P and Pixel Are Nothing Less Than Spectacular The headphones feature Active Noise Canceling (ANC) that can be switched on and off using a dedicated toggle. One side of the Google headphones also features a power button. The wireless headphones flaunt a simple Google logo that is not actually a logo but four Google colors arranged in a circle. Identified as “GID5B,” the headphones carry a 600mAh battery that charges through a microUSB, according to the FCC filing. Looking at the spotted images, the cups have thick padding, almost bordering on being ugly. Additionally, the Google headphones support Bluetooth, have an AUX connector, and have a battery life of 25 hours over Bluetooth and 16 hours with ANC enabled. Advertisement For years, consumers had believed that Google’s manufacturing partners like HTC, Sony and Samsung will act fast when it comes to Android updates once they face a competition directly from Google. Last year’s launch of Pixel and Pixel XL has proven that this strategy works, as we have seen OEMs being more aggressive when it comes to security and feature updates this year. Is Google continuing to work in the same direction, now planning to offer its own accessories, as well? If so, at least this audio accessory doesn’t look half as pretty as it should. Related Will Google Read Your Mind to Offer “Copyless” Pasting on Android? Nope, Won’t Be That Cool – Yet Here are the images spotted in the FCC filing: [Update]: Possibly something for Googlers AndroidPolice reports – refering to a tipster – that these wireless headphones are more likely built to replace the current model used by Google employees. “Google issues headphones to a large number of its employees, and the current model is getting quite long in the tooth,” AP reported. Here’s the image of the audio accessory that is currently being used by Googlers. So yep, no reason to get excited.

Opinion: Google should fix its erratic reminder system Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/26 2:15pm PDTApr 26, 2017 14 Plus 1 on G+ 52 Share on Facebook 46 Share on Twitter Total Shares112 Applications Editorials Google Article Contents 1 Input methods 2 Quick Access 3 Notifications 4 Allo and Home 5 Conclusion The ability to quickly set a reminder on your phone is one many of us take for granted these days. Smartphones have seemingly always had this basic PDA functionality. Type ‘add reminder’ into the Google search box and you’ll be able to quickly set up a notification to jog your memory about something later on. You can even use the ‘OK Google’ voice command: “remind me to pick up the groceries at 6pm,” for example. Easy-peasy. For most people, this function is used occasionally for something really important they simply mustn't forget. And for those people, it probably works just fine. However, for some people (like me) reminders have become an absolute necessity. I hate to admit it, but I have a really bad memory. Truly awful. For this reason, I am almost entirely dependent on Google’s system of reminders to navigate through each day. My phone will buzz with a reminder around 15 times per day. Some of these are one-offs. Some are recurring. All of them are to remind me to do something important, and without them, there’s no telling what I might forget to do. Don’t get me wrong, I am incredibly grateful that I am able to set reminders on my phone at all. But my extensive use of Google’s reminder system has also led me to conclude that it is inherently flawed. The biggest issue, as I see it, is a lack of consistency. Allow me to explain. Input methods There are currently no fewer than 6 distinct reminder input methods available to a typical Android user: Google app (including Google Assistant on compatible devices) Inbox Keep Calendar Chrome Allo Assistant With so many options, there’s always a convenient way to add a reminder to your Google account, whatever you happen to be doing when the need arises. Not all reminders are created equally, however. Add a reminder using any of the first 3 methods in the list and you’re offered the same basic options, such as when or where you’d like to be reminded and if you’d like the reminder to repeat. Inbox insists on using its ‘snooze’ terminology to denote reminder time, which isn’t ideal but we can handle that. Keep reminders are obviously linked to a specific note so you may not always want to use this option if you’d prefer your notes list to stay nice and tidy. They do still show up in your reminders list on the Google app, though, and can be dismissed from there accordingly. You cannot edit Keep reminders from within the Google app, however. To do that you’ll have hit the “Open in Google Keep” link and go through to the app itself. A Keep entry in the Google app's reminders list. If the experience already seems a little messy, it’s when you add a reminder to the Google Calendar app that things start to get weird. Firstly, these entries default to an ‘all day’ event, which seems a little counter-intuitive. It’s not difficult to change this to a timed reminder, but it's a slight annoyance that this option isn't the default. Secondly, unless you have the ‘Reminders’ box checked, which makes all of your reminders visible in your Calendar, none that you set here will actually deliver a notification. Having this option checked may not be a problem if you have one or two reminders set over the course of the week. But as I’ve already explained, I have many, many more than that. So when I set the Reminders calendar to be visible, in order to have the notifications working, my Calendar looks like this… My eyes!!! It even includes distinct entries for recurring reminders. So if you have a reminder set to recur every day it will show up in the month view for every single day, rather than just the next instance. The result is a mess. Needless to say that completely rules out Google Calendar as a method of input for me. Unfortunately, it took a couple of missed reminders when I didn’t have the option checked to figure out that the calendar functioned in this way. This was obviously frustrating, and I was lucky not to miss out on even more important notifications before I realized they weren't showing up. Another potentially handy way to set a reminder is by searching ‘add reminder’ on the Google homepage in your browser (on desktop or mobile). Regardless of browser or OS, if you’re logged into your Google account you should be able to easily set a reminder this way. Of course, there are a couple of limitations here too. First of all, there is no option to set a recurrence if you use this input method. You can revisit the entry in the Google app later on and set a recurrence there, but that kind of defeats the purpose of being able to add it in your browser in the first place. The second issue is that you can only set the reminder for predetermined times of the day. These include morning, afternoon, evening or night, as well as set times of on the hour (12:00) or half past the hour (12:30). This simply isn’t specific enough for certain tasks, and as a result, I tend to steer clear of adding reminders this way (except in an emergency), preferring the other more feature-rich methods. Quick Access At the moment there isn’t an especially fast way to enter a reminder input from your Android phone’s launcher. The ‘OK Google’ hotword (or Google Assistant on compatible devices) is easily the fastest method currently available, but there are still many of us who don't wish to talk loudly at our phones in public. Or even in private, for that matter. It's also worth mentioning that if you use the voice method this can often lead to misunderstandings or having to type extra information anyway. The Screen Search reminder button - simply not fast enough. The easiest solution would seemingly be to have a one-tap option to go straight into a reminder from your device homescreen. Instead, we have to long-press of the home button (on non-Assistant devices) which brings up Screen Search (previously Now on Tap) and click the pink Reminder button, or we can type ‘Add reminder’ into the search bar or Google app. Both of these routes often feel painfully slow. We do have app shortcuts for Calendar and Keep, which is great. But each app comes with its own feature limitations, discussed earlier, which preclude me from considering either as a viable option. If only the Google app has an "Add reminder" app shortcut or widget, the process would be a breeze. App shortcuts - why can't the Google app copy this approach? If you want to view and manage your reminders list there are several ways to do so. The Google app has a reminders list in the menu, and this is probably the most complete, robust way to manage them. Inbox displays them as pinned items in among your emails, or you can filter out everything else and view them in their own list, which functions similar to the list in the Google app. You can also snooze these in Inbox just as you can with emails. Keep has a section showing any notes that have reminders set against them, but doesn’t concern itself with any reminders not attached to one of its own notes. Lastly, Calendar (as you can see in the image further up) displays every single upcoming reminder alongside all of your other events, rendering it practically unusable. Notifications More examples of inconsistencies across these apps can be found in the notification shade. How each reminder is displayed and the quick actions associated with each vary widely. To dismiss this I must mark all 8 as ‘Finished’, including two I can't even see. When you have multiple Google app reminders they are bundled together in a single notification, rather than separated out into individual items. The only action you can perform is to mark all as ‘Finished’, dismissing every one of them at once. Another thing to remember is that notifications in Nougat only show up to 6 lines of content per app at any one time. So, in the example above there are two reminders I can’t even view without entering into the app. When you do enter into the app to mark individual items complete, that dismisses the notification from the shade entirely. If you were hoping to leave it there for the rest of the day as a glanceable to do list, you’re out of luck. Calendar reminder notifications similarly give you only the option to mark as done, but where they improve over the Google app is that you can tap into each individually and edit the reminder time on the next screen. This won’t affect the other notifications from the app. Inbox notifications are bundled rather more usefully, with each being individually expandable and giving the option to either mark as ‘Done’ or to ‘Snooze’. This offers you greater control over your tasks. While this is much closer to how it should be done, Keep refines this even further. Its notifications are also unbundled and come with two individual actions to choose from, snooze for an hour or snooze for even later. Swipe away the notification and you dismiss the reminder altogether, condemning it to the ‘Past’ section of the reminders list in the Google app. The exception being recurring reminders, which will still come back the next time they are set to recur. This is arguably the best way to handle reminder notifications, but you have to be happy to clog up your Keep list with reminders in order to utilize this. Keep's reminder notification - best in class. Your Google Now feed is yet another place you can interact with your reminder notifications. There, it’s possible to snooze reminders for an hour or mark as finished. But there seems to be little rhyme nor reason to how long reminder cards remain actionable in Google Now. It’s not uncommon for me to see a notification in Google Now long after I’ve dismissed it elsewhere, and vice versa. While the cards remain useful in some instances, this isn't a reliable way to manage your task list. Allo and Home Some of you may have noticed that I haven’t mentioned how the Google Assistant in Allo handles reminders. That’s because for some reason these reminders are kept completely separate from all those discussed above. They won’t appear in any of the other apps and can only be viewed in the Allo app when it notifies you. The notification is displayed as a message from the Assistant itself and it doesn’t appear as though you can snooze it at all, not even if you ask really nicely. Allo isn’t the only way to interact with the Google Assistant, of course, the other being Google Home. You might think that reminders would be a key function of the smart home device, but curiously you still can’t ask Home to remind you of something, months after its release. Even the addition of multi-user support hasn't yet brought with it the ability to add reminders. Much has been written about Home and Assistant still feeling like beta products. With omissions like this, it’s hard to disagree with that. Conclusion By experimenting with Google’s reminder system across all of these apps and interfaces, it’s probably possible to eventually find a way to make it work for you. I would argue that you shouldn’t have to work quite so hard to utilize what is in essence quite a basic service. I’ve tried countless other Android apps in a bid to satisfy my reminder needs, and effectively replace my defective memory. But nothing seems to hit the right balance of good design, usability, and features. Plus, there’s no substitute for being able to easily access my reminders from any device on which I can access my Google account, something Google’s reminder system still boasts over every other option on the Play Store. Still, there has to be a way to merge all of these separate interfaces and functions into a less frustrating experience. I'm sure this isn't a huge priority at Google, but I can dream, can't I? A discrete Google Reminders app would seem an obvious solution. One that plugs into the other Google services but ultimately acts as a standalone master-app might be the best way to alleviate some of these shortcomings and offer the experience I expect from a service like this. Then again, maybe it’s just me. Maybe I’m the only person who uses reminders to quite this extent and I should, in fact, seek help. Hopefully, that’s not the case. And hopefully someone at Google uses reminders just as much as I do, and with just as much frustration. Tags allo calendar google app google assistant google home inbox keep subscribe ...

Anything I set using voice is getting marked as done within 10 minutes of them notifying me. At first I thought I was crazy, I was seeing reminders in my Inbox that I had set while driving, but an hour later I'd say to myself "Wait didn't I set a reminder to do X?", only to find I HAD created the reminder, but it was marked as done. I can't figure it out! I opened a ticket with Google only to have some rep tell me I needed to clear my cache, but it still happens even when all my devices are off and browsers closed. Kevin Luther Yup. They have been really messed up. I keep finding them marked as done when j never even got the notice Simon Levin Yes that happens to me all the time. I've come to not rely on reminders for anything serious. catalysto I regularly encounter quirks like this with Google reminders. It's for this reason (and all the other stuff Scott said) that I only ever interact with them via Inbox. Fortunately, I enjoy using Inbox, so using that method is relatively painless for me, but for those who don't... Well hopefully the nightmare ends soon. A centralized reminder database/app seems to be the best solution. ShahinTr I just use events. I never bother using reminder, it's an absolute waste of time and space on calendar. Charles222 I've largely abandoned reminders in favor of calendar events and todoist. Todoist in particular, since it has equally-favored apps for the three OS's I use and Home support. David Ruddock Todoist seems very robust. I always consider trying it, then just don't because most of my reminding comes from calendar events, as you say. I want the solution to feel as integrated as possible. Scott Scrivens I have tried Todoist but I didn't like it. I don't actually remember why though...maybe I'll give it another shot. Waveblade Second on Todoist, just replacing it outright is better and the interface is way better than any other ones I've used. The other thing is context awareness is great. "Send email today at 4PM #" will figure out where it all goes. That is the killer feature about it wheelingdad If you need to set 15 reminders a day then you might look inward instead of trying to create/change a system that fits your issue. Just saying... Scott Scrivens pls halp Bruce Wayne Exactly. 15 reminders in a day is just absurd. I saw one of his screenshots and there was a reminder to "charge his phone". That says it all. Matt That calendar is what Leonard from Memento would have if they made that movie today. XerBlade Everything was just peachy for me using Inbox's reminder tools for all of this... until recently. For the last couple weeks, Google has made an incredibly asinine change where time-based notifications will automatically be marked as Done in just under an hour if you don't do it yourself. Which really mucks things up when you're, what's a simple example that's easy to convey... Say you set a reminder a while back that you forgot about (which is pretty much why you set a reminder in the first place), and it goes off while you're in a movie (and you didn't adjust it to go off later on after you're back from the movie beforehand because, you know, you don't have eidetic memory which is why you need reminders in the first place). Said reminder goes away on its own before the movie ends, so you never actually see it. That kind of BS has been happening to me DAILY since this started. [Notifications you just leave sitting in your inbox forever and never "Snooze" are fine though. Yay.] Kevin Luther I have been missing so many reminders lately as well. It's utter garbage destinyhud Here is what i do. I use google app to set all reminders. it will flow to calendar and keep is just for note taking. Now i set calendar events for more important thing to be reminder me a second time just to be be careful like my monthly mortgage Scott Scrivens This is essentially what I do currently. I wish it just worked from everywhere though. blahmoomoo Allo's subscriptions are kind of broken anyway, though I don't know if that also applies to recurring reminders. I told Allo to tell me the weather every morning, but if you don't chat with the bot on occasion, it stops doing that after about a week. Then I forget that it was supposed to remind me about the weather for a few days after each time that happened. So I have ultimately given up on it. EDIT: to be clear, the subscription is still there. It just forgets to keep sending it after a while if you don't talk to the bot, intentionally or not. 4Ui812 Google needs to fix more than just the reminder system. This is probably the least of their problems. Grey They should also bring Reminders to Gmail. Why is it Inbox-only? The other Inbox feature, Email Reminders, should be baked into the next version of Google. After that, what makes Inbox different? Jason Bell The biggest issue I've been having is that reminders don't always give me a real notification. It's always there in the Google App when I open it, but sometimes there's no notification. sam1331 I was just looking into this today. I've become increasingly dependent on reminders, and basically use it as my to do list these days. However, it definitely could be improved. The thing about the notifications is huge, if I have multiple pop up I have to click on the notification to dismiss one, and then the others are no longer sitting there in my notifications. Then I have to reschedule them to get them to sit there again, which is the whole point of the entire system. If they disappear from my notification shade, how will I remember to do them? I might as well not even use Google's reminder system at all then. It's just so convenient to type "remind me to..." in the search box and have it add whatever it is. MisterAlex I recently got a reminder notification for a "when I get home" reminder that I'd set over a year ago. No freakin' clue what made this particular arrival at home special enough to trigger it again... :v Jen Once they get all THIS stuff straightened out, I'd love the ability to set reminders by Time AND Location. For example, I'd love to say "Remind me to do laundry when I get home tonight" while I'm still at home in the morning... Right now, that would just "remind" me immediately since I'm still at home, or if I set it to a specific time, it might remind me before I get home in the evening or after I've been home a while. It'd also be useful for locations that have open/close times, like stores, where a location-only reminder won't be helpful if you frequently walk by at a time when it's closed. Having a Time + Location context would be immensely helpful! N8SLC This works for me. I use the assistant mostly. Scott Scrivens This. This would be so useful. PHLAK I also rely on reminders heavily. Hover, I limit myself to just using them through Inbox (both on the web and phone) to avoid all this complication. A stand-alone reminders app to "unify" reminder functionality would be awesome. Crossstick You & me Scott. I'm on a 12 person sales team plus a manager. NO ONE, but me uses automated reminders. I can't live without 'em. Ever since the original Palm Pilot ! Keep is my main workhorse for the past couple of years. Alex Renna This is the reason I switched to using a To-Do app (Todoist). There used to be a Gmail add-in (#todo) that stopped development after Google implemented Reminders on Calendar, and acted like you stated, only one occurrence that would move days until it was completed. If that made a come back I would be a happy man. kimbo I haven't had to make any reminders recently but I thankfully haven't experienced these issues before Cakefish I use Keep reminders a few times a month for important stuff like meetings and deadlines. Dozens of reminders a day? I wouldn't want to be that dependant on technology to function properly in everyday life. I can usually remember the mundane everyday stuff pretty well on my own, such as remembering to buy food and eat it, drink to keep myself hydrated, charge my phone when the battery gets low, go to the toilet, breathe in and out etc. Everyone's different though! Each to their own. Shakil Shaikh Jut install Tasks, the app formally known as Astrid: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.tasks Workflow wise, resizable/fiterable widgets do it for me (they also provide a quick way to enter a categorised task). Persistent notifications help in some cases too. Mostly though, it's the only to-do app that offers recurring tasks on both scheduled date (every 3rd Monday) or on completed date (3 weeks since last completed). It'd probably be quicker and healthier than waiting for Google to create some kind of compromised workflow for you instead. Scott Scrivens I was actually an avid Astrid user back in the day. Miss that little octopus. My issue with this as a solution is that I always need to use my phone. I'm looking for cross-device/platform integration. LaserWraith I tried to use Google's reminders in the past but gave up for reasons similar to yours. Todoist keeps me on track now across all my devices and it's pretty great. Some flaws still, but a big improvement. Raymond Berger Have you tried TickTick? I've been using it for years and it was been absolutely fantastic. It works across many platforms and has a relatively simple interface but also plenty of options for power users. Trip66 Been using it for years I love it...Bought it Immediately.+1 N8SLC You can de-select the reminders calendar. As for the rest, I think the sheer volume is on you. ;) Scott Scrivens You can, but then any reminder you set using Calendar won't work. Deeco PREACH AP!!! Please make more articles like these to highlight these simple anoying flaws. Let us be heard and get Google off​ their backside! ellett Why can't a reminder play a sound? As it stands now you can get an email or have a notification pop up, but everything is silent, which is useless if I'm doing something else when the reminder triggers. If I need an alarm, I have to set a reminder several hours in advance to remind me to set a phone alarm. Sophie Yes, many of these things have been bothering me, too! The state of Google's reminder system is much like their chat/messaging apps: confusing and fragmented (Ok, maybe it's not as bad as the chat/messaging apps). Like the author, I also rely on reminders (my calendar looks alot like his!). I primarily interact with them through the Google app, as well as a script I wrote for the Linux command-line that allows me to quickly add timed reminders (Google calls them quick events) to a special "My reminders" calendar (I wish I could save them to the default Reminders calendar that Calendar and the Google app seem to use, but it seems off-limits to developers). If Google's voice-to-text translation was better, I would stick to the Google app, I really don't mind talking at my phone, in public or otherwise, but it's not great. I have to correct things so often that I might as well type it in half the time (hence the command-line script). bdbplatano 🍻 Here's to hoping Google's paying attention🍻 Wolfie410 My biggest issue had to do with recurring reminders set through Google Now/Assistant. I was unable to clear a reminder ahead of schedule, without completely deleting the future occurrences of the recurring task. The only other option was to wait for the notification to pop and then dismiss it. Not very convenient. Have beem using the splendo to-do list. Rudresh Another way is to set an alarm with a note, works best for me. Lateef Alabi-Oki I wonder how hard it is to create a single reminder service, with a consistent API and behavior, that all their front-end services and third-party apps can use? Just thinking out loud here. Bruce Wayne I can't imagine why you would need a reminder to charge your phone. Trip66 Many of these shortcuts can be added to the homescreen in most launchers and especially in Nova but I use the OK Google method and several times a day. "Remind me in one hour that at 2pm so and so is coming by to.... That type of stuff... and I plan my whole day everyday so I don't forget someone is coming by or I have to be somewhere etc etc. It's a godsend to me and I can do it all hands free and 90% of the time it's in the car via BT. Awesome.ability. I fix computers all day so I'm always picking up or dropping off and also people drop and pickup to me so it reminds me when so I dont leave if someone is coming over or I have to be to their place at a specific time. But I haven't had any issues with them being marked as done or anything and they always go off at the time I say to. Viral Kacha https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5ee1efd75a870942aa10e7ecb1adcdfe05ac836338f4823d2d7a45180f970b2b.png "If only the Google app has an "Add reminder" app shortcut or widget, the process would be a breeze." Inbox app has the widget and it's quite neat and inclusive of all the features. Luzandro I also use the inbox widget, which works quite well for me, except when the shown presets for snoozing aren't appropriate (which is quite often the case for me, as the soonest suggestion is in the evening) it takes surprisingly many steps to choose something different TedPhillips yesss. the bundling gets me since if i finish one reminder but have a few overlapping (but not too many like you), need to be very aggressive but also careful about notification shade grooming. out of sight out of mind and all that. A+ Simon Levin Thank you. If only Google cared to fix their old products. Nathan J For me, reminders have always been crap on both platforms. On Android, I used an app called Lotify. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nll.lotify The nice thing about this app is that you have a ton of options, and a huge selection of icons to choose from, so if you have a lot, they stand out from one another. I expected iOS to be leaps and bounds ahead, because an iPhone just works, right? Not so fast. I found iOS lacking in that regard. Via Reddit, I found an app called "HiFutureSelf" that simulates a text message. You put in the message and the time you want to receive it. You can set a unique ringtone for the app. And when the time comes, you get your message. It suits my purposes. There might be better options, but I haven't seen any, personally. Ryan Warmack Business calendar pro hits the nail on the head for me. ilovetesla can anybody petition google to make adding birthdays and anniversaries to calendar easy Alicia Frederick Inbox has a widget you can add to the home screen on your phone for single tap quick access, which might help with the notifications since Inbox does them better. Jeremy Couch One thing that I hate is that when you dismiss Android notifications of reminders from Keep they mark it as Done. So I stopped using Keep for reminders. Very annoying. Ste Tan Excellent article. Reminders have been a pain for me as well throughout Google services. I've tried so many different apps—apps like todoist,etc— that just isn't as convenient for me compared to a native solution by Google. I eventually just went back to using Calender and keep for reminders and though it does become aggravating, I've grown to just deal with it since I need to use it daily. A Google reminders app would be perfect, especially since it would seemlessly sync and work consistently throughout all my Android devices plus any other device I have my Google account connected to. I really hope Google sees this article and takes it into consideration. Fabian Todt personally i like how google calender reminders show up, that's exactly how/why i use them: these are tasks/todos i have to do at this very moment so they are like an event/meeting. this is somehow similar to the getting things done method: i've got all tasks in todoist and plan them as reminders in calender when i have to do them. Neil S The article says that there is no widget for reminders that can be added to the home screen. I have one on my phone. The Google inbox app has a reminder set up widget which is quick to use. Just tape the reminder widget button and enter the reminder text, then hit the clock icon to set it for any time you like and to repeat if you like.

Super interesting, in fact. Besides the intrigue of the mournful saga of Note7, whose embarrassing recall cost the company billions, Samsung also set up a dramatic release narrative for the Galaxy S8. This wasn't just another smartphone — this was a make-or-break device charged with saving a company in the throes of an existential crisis. A smartphone that screams at the void — yikes! All product photos: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo With the stakes high, Samsung has delivered a device that legitimately stands out from the rest. The $1199 Galaxy S8 is a good enough phone that Samsung can likely leave that Note7 drama behind. (Though, you know, we're still waiting to see what unfortunate cataclysm will befall the S8 now.) Ultimately, what makes the S8 a winner isn't any of the assistant smart features that manufacturers have been pushing hard over the last few years — in fact Samsung's entrant here, Bixby, falls short. The S8 wins with an industry-leading hardware design that challenges the iPhone's aesthetic supremacy. The Pixel (right) always looked dorky with it's home button free bezel, but it looks even worse next to the micro-bezel on the S8+ (left). If you buy the Galaxy S8, you're buying it because it's the most beautiful phone available. While it falls short of being completely bezel-less, it might as well be. Though LG released a similarly bezel-less device earlier this year, it suffered from an excess of simplicity. Samsung is way ahead of most competitors you would realistically consider, like the Google Pixel, and the iPhone 7, which are both encased in unsightly prisons of bezel. The S8+ (left) versus last year's S7 Edge (right). The design is a huge leap forward for Samsung, which has been inching in this direction for years with its edge display devices. This thing is practically all display on the front — Samsung even got rid of its physical home button. The phone's gently rounded edges and curves create the effect of a display that's simply floating in the air or hovering just above your hand. There are no jarring interruptions to the minimal design. It feels like you're looking at a phone from the future, rather than a tired rehash of a winning design from the past — unsurprisingly, Apple is reportedly considering a similar look on its forthcoming iPhone. The S8 comes in two display sizes — a 5.8-inch Galaxy S8 ($1199), and the 6.2-inch S8+ ($1349). I tested the S8+, but the only difference between the two devices is size and price. Those display sizes make it difficult to compare them to other devices. Both S8s have an 18.5:9 aspect ratio, as opposed the more traditional 16:9 shape. Consequently the S8+ is a little thicker and taller than the iPhone 7 Plus, as well as very slightly narrower. Nitpicking aside, they're basically the same size: The S8+ and iPhone 7 Plus (bottom). There's been some debate about the merits of the new 18.5:9 aspect ratio (LG, again, did something similar this year, too). Most of the content you will view on websites, Netflix, Hulu, and so on, is 16:9 so it fills up the entirety of devices like the iPhone. Meanwhile, watch the same content on the S8, and the picture will be surrounded by black bars. It feels wasteful, but, as you see in the image above, it isn't the end of the world. Galaxy S8+'s display is bright and vibrant. Compared to the other phones you might consider buying these days, the S8's OLED is noticeably brighter and more vivid. Your photos will pop on this display. Bixby's dashboard looks a lot like the old Google Now interface. Besides the hardware design, the other fresh addition in the S8 is Bixby, Samsung's newly acquired digital assistant tech that's meant to compete with Google Assistant, Apple's Siri, and Amazon's Alexa. At launch, Bixby will not support voice commands, though Samsung promises that feature will land this spring. I promised myself I wasn't going to nail Samsung for shipping unfinished product (despite what happened the last time Samsung did). In the end I don't need to. Most voice assistants are dumb as hell, including Google Assistant, which is also built into the S8, but Bixby's bad enough that adding voice support wouldn't even make a difference. Many of Bixby's features seem amazing at first glance. Like the hardware button Samsung has built onto the side of the phone. It wakes Bixby up with a touch instead of a shout. There is nothing I hate more than invoking assistants by name. OK Google — tell me I sound like an arsehole! Push the button, and Bixby's Google Now-like dashboard display pops up, showing your appointments, the weather, and information from supported apps like Samsung Health and CNN. The Galaxy S8 is the prettiest phone you can buy right now. In practice, the additional hardware button just causes confusion. I frequently hit it instead of the volume down button, pulling up the assistant instead of taking a photo or reducing the loudness of my music. Worse, one morning when the S8's alarm clock woke me up at the ungodly hour I go to the gym, I dumbly fumbled around for my phone and instead of waking it up to turn off my alarms, I was presented with all the meetings I had planned for the day, as if Bixby's sole purpose was to remind my that my every waking hour will be toil and suffering. The assistant's potentially most impressive feature is Bixby Vision, which allows you to use the phone's camera to search by image. This kind of technology has existed from years — Amazon introduced an impressive feature called Flow three years ago. So it's incredible how bad this feature is. When you tap the little Bixby Vision button in the S8's camera app, the tool takes a moment to process what you're looking at, and then presents you with the option to use the image to do a general search, a shopping search, or in the event that it identifies wine or text, to treat the visual information accordingly. The only Bixby Vision tool that works with any level of consistency is the shopping tool, which identified a Monster energy drink (SUGAR FREE!) and a Neil deGrasse Tyson book correctly. When I pointed it at very expensive over-ear headphones headphones, it tried to sell me moderately priced earbuds, which fair enough, I don't need to spend $1000 on headphones. Bixby's shopping search works reliably. The more general image search capability is a joke, and feels like a failure. The only image it was able to identify correctly is an old photograph by German documentary photographer August Sander. Sure, this is just a Pinterest search, but I'm having trouble figuring out what the hell the point of this is. Bixby's Pinterest-powered search is not very useful for anything. As for the wine and text tools — they need serious work. The only time Bixby identified a wine bottle, I wasn't pointing it at wine. The text tool has a hard job, and tends to interpret everything but the cleanest Helvetica typography as a garbled mess. Hello Bixby, you suck. Beyond the frustrating assistant, Samsung's software is actually really nicely refined. TouchWiz, the company's proprietary spin on Android, is no longer the unattractive horrorshow it was for years — mostly because Samsung has increasingly stayed out of Google's way. Some of Samsung's software additions are legitimately useful, like the Apps Edge drawer, which slides out a customisable collection of your favourite apps with a swipe from the right edge of the display. Samsung's camera is good enough for your snaps and 'grams. There's no dual camera like you're finding on some other devices, but at least it comes with some built-in Snapchat Lens-like filters — Cool? The S8's most annoying quirk is the oddly-placed fingerprint sensor. Less cool is Samsung moving the fingerprint scanner to the back of the phone to the side of the camera was a mistake. It's not placement on the back so much, which was likely necessary to make that beautiful bezel-less front. It's that the sensor is off center so it lacks the intuitive feel of fingerprint sensors that are smack in the middle, as in the case of the Google Pixel and LG G6. What's more, Samsung has gone and put the freaking camera exactly where your brain wants the sensor to be. Instagram your fried chicken dinner at your own risk. In the end, the $1199 Galaxy S8 handily smokes the Android competition as the top phone you can buy. It's prettier and slicker than the Pixel, and though Bixby feels a little unfinished for the moment, you can still use Google Assistant. The S8 also measures up favourably with the iPhone 7, and whether you choose one or the other probably comes down to something as simple as whether you want Samsung's forward-thinking ideas or Apple's refined simplicity. Or maybe you want a headphone jack — the S8 has one! As for whether you should upgrade, well, that's another question entirely. How busted is your current phone? Is it broken and you need a new one? The S8 is a great option. Is your phone less than two years old and humming along fine? Wait until next year. What's truly interesting about the S8 is just how compelling a phone can be on the merits of its great design alone. Bixby is basically rubbish, and yet the phone is a winner. Perhaps it shouldn't be all that surprising: Top flagship phones with beefy specs are going to perform very well without fail these days. They all have good cameras and day-long battery life and processors that can chop through huge mobile games. It's so challenging to make a device stand out that manufacturers are employing all manner of gimmicks, like voice assistants and modular accessories, to see if they can't make their devices standout. None of those technologies improve your life quite as much as a design that plays into our crudest superficiality; I stare at my phone all goddamn day — I want to look at something pretty. README The prettiest phone you can buy right now. The new 18.5:9 aspect ratio doesn't really make a huge difference, but you will notice black bars around your YouTube videos now. Bixby Vision is really only good as a shopping tool. Bixby, like all AI assistants, is too half-baked to be really useful in a life-changing way. Comments Join the discussion!

Most Popular Getty Smith Collection/Gado / Contributor By Avery Thompson Apr 26, 2017 Larry Page isn't the only Google exec interesting in flight. On the heels of news about Page's startup Kitty Hawk comes a Bloomberg report about Google cofounder Sergey Brin and his secret project to build an airship. According to four people who spoke to Bloomberg, Brin has been building an airship inside Hangar 2 at NASA's Ames Research Center. Sources report that the airship resembles a zeppelin but refused to elaborate on the details. The sources also said that this project does not fall under the Alphabet umbrella, so it may by a separate startup or simply a personal project of Brin's. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Bloomberg also reports that Alan Weston, the former director of programs at NASA Ames, is heading this project. Weston previously spoke about designing a prototype airship in a radio interview in 2013 involving breathable air sacs that could alter the buoyancy of the craft. It's unknown if this prototype is related to the Brin project. Related Story Airship of Dreams: Lighter-Than-Air Travel Is Back Airships have been a goal for several companies for years. Airships can carry people and cargo much more cheaply and efficiently than planes or trucks, but engineering and cost hurdles have kept them grounded for now. But the concept of giant airships for travel or shipping still has merit. Maybe all the idea needs a passionate multi-billionaire and a novel prototype for lift off.

Google Photos v2.14 is preparing personalized experiences and sharing suggestions based around facial recognition [APK Teardown] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/04/26 5:08pm PDTApr 26, 2017 21 Plus 1 on G+ 40 Share on Facebook 39 Share on Twitter Total Shares100 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News When the Photos app launched in 2015, Google had already been working on computer vision for many years. It was no surprise that object recognition was a major draw for the app, and automatic sorting of pictures by person with the use of facial recognition became a must-have feature. Google is now looking to leverage this technology to make the Photos app a bit more social. A teardown of the latest Photos update reveals the service will soon offer additional features based around facial recognition, and even encourage users to share pictures with the people detected in them. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. Since facial recognition is a sensitive privacy topic, it's worth a quick sanity check to reduce confusion and knee-jerk reactions going into this teardown. Everything discussed here is opt-in and the features will not work if users do not select a photo of themselves, and that means nothing can happen accidentally or without granting permission. Furthermore, most of the features are only slightly modified versions of existing aspects of the app and pose no additional risk to privacy. I'll leave it up to each reader to determine how they feel about the remaining functions and their practical implications. Face recognition for personalization, sharing, and more Instead of opening with the reason this feature might be useful, I'm going to jump straight to a summary of how Google is going to present it. Quite simply, the Photos app is going to ask users to "personalize" their experience by selecting a picture of themselves from the list of previously identified faces. If you already named yourself, the group might be renamed "Me" after making the selection. <string name="photos_facegaia_optin_impl_title">Personalize Google Photos by labeling your face</string> <string name="photos_facegaia_optin_impl_desc">Which face is yours?</string> <string name="photos_facegaia_optin_impl_picker_face_picker_title">Select your face</string> <string name="photos_facegaia_optin_impl_confirmation_toast_msg">All set! Try searching for “Me”.</string> Face recognition isn't just the tool, it's actually part of the pitch to get users interested. Google's explanation is broken up into two parts, the first of which offers to reward users for choosing a face with "personalized search, creations, and more." <string name="photos_facegaia_optin_impl_detailed_desc0">Get personalized search, creations, and more based on your face?</string> Personalized search is explained by the toast message above – it just means you can search for "me" to find pictures of yourself. I assume "creations" are the same auto-generated albums, collages, and animations we usually see in the Assistant tab, but obviously focused on you, the user. Both of these sound like things we have now. <string name="photos_facegaia_optin_impl_detailed_desc1">Allow your contacts' Google Photos apps to recognize your face in photos for faster sharing? &lt;a href=help:&gt;More&lt;/a&gt;</string> It's the second part of the explanation where things get interesting. If you have identified your face for Google Photos, you can also give permission to have the app on other people's phones recognize you when pictures are taken. To be clear, this can only happen for people if they are in your contact list and if you've given permission for it to make matches.

settings for managing the new facial recognition features, but they are just there to turn the grouping features on and off, or to change the face you selected in the past – perhaps you tapped on the wrong mug during setup, or maybe had plastic surgery, I guess. code <string name="photos_settings_faceclustering_advanced_face_recognition_setting_title">Face grouping</string> <string

My biggest question is what users will see after they take a picture of somebody else and a match is made. Primarily, will the photographer be prompted to share the photo, will it quietly include some visual marker that somebody was detected, or will it remain quiet and simply make intelligent suggestions if the share button is pressed? A big feature like this is probably not going to trigger quietly, so I expect notifications, but that could get pretty overwhelming after something like an office party or family reunion. Unfortunately, I'm sure there are many unanswered questions, and since the implementation isn't done and there are missing pieces, there aren't going to be answers quite yet. The potential problem for features like this is that they tip-toe right up to the line where many people feel uncomfortable about potential privacy issues. It looks like Google has done a good job of designing barriers to avoid some of those issues, and it's clear users are responsible for making their own decisions. It's important that this is an opt-in feature by default. I do like the idea of using facial recognition to smooth out the rough edges of sharing photos with people, especially if it also acts as a reminder. I admit, I have a bad habit of taking pictures of friends and forgetting to share them later. If this goes well, Google might have the killer feature that turns Photos into a must-use service.

Southern Discomfort Yep, see this as super profitable for the big G. Knows your face, scans all your pictures and notices a slew of recent pictures all showing Best Buy in the background. Guess what shows up in your Gmail inbox within moments...?? Yeah, I don't know. This sounds like the tide turning type of thing and is actually kinda spooky for me. I get that Goog does this type of thing, but dang... Willie Chalmers III I really doubt that's going to happen. It's a slippery slope, and if they wanted to do that, they likely would have done it by now to some extent, and people would notice. James Briano Oh, Google already knows. When I search Drive for "Best Buy" I get a lot of interesting results. Example attached. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/45ff7b47285e47474877510e0456d559a7344aca80b48062d208178aa0e33897.jpg Theo Logian There is likely location data attached to that photo rather than image recognition of that big yellow tag. tik Yup... location based versus recognizing text in the image. trekker Photos face recognition is brilliant - especially when visiting a friend and quickly being able to find photos from the past to enjoy together. However currently they decide who gets a name label (or tag) and this means i have many people who remain unsearchable. Please can we manually add names ourselves? The system where Google provides choices for names does not work. whispy_snippet "you can also give permission to have the app on other people's phones recognize you when pictures are taken." Doesn't Google Photos already effectively do this? If I go to the auto generated "people" album I can see a whole bunch of photos of people clustered via facial recognition. Yes, I had to turn this feature on and individually label people, but the end result is now effectively the same. My app recognises faces. Jens M Eichkorn What's new is that it will associate faces with actual names / Google accounts whispy_snippet Sure, I understand that. But what I'm trying to say is that if a user chooses to do so, they can make Google Photos do this already. The tear down gives the impression that a person needs to opt-in to allow their face to be recognised in images taken by someone else. What I'm saying is that I can already go into my Photos app, enable face recognition, label some faces and bam, I'm getting the same result. This teardown suggests people can soon can opt-in to something that's already effectively live anyway. What seems new is that the process looks more streamlined. But I'd have thought many people would be more concerned with a right to opt-in to facial recognition, not a right to opt-in to a more streamlined process. Am I making sense? I feel like I'm not articulating myself well here. JG Doesn't Google Photos already effectively do this? From the article: Furthermore, most of the features are only slightly modified versions of existing aspects of the app and pose no additional risk to privacy. whispy_snippet Ah yep, I must have missed that bit. Well it makes sense. But yeah, I guess my other key question still stands - why is there a need to give people the option to opt-in to something that's effectively out of their hands? Your face can already be recognised in someone else's Google Photos "people" album. David Hyman What if it knew you were together and it automatically shared the pictures with other people. Basically automatically creating a shared album Paul_Werner I'd love that Kevfromspace Any news on printing Google Photos albums a la Apple Photos Books? tik Definitely excited with all of the new updates. But, at the same time, it'd be great if Google Photos could... - Batch edit pictures - Batch remove pictures/albums from Google Photos (instead of the 1500 picture limit) - Batch download pictures to device Si vis pacem, para bellum The feature I am waiting for the most is some damn basic drawing tool while editing a photo...

Google Trips soon to include itinerary sharing and expanded reservation support Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/26 2:00pm PDTApr 26, 2017 6 Plus 1 on G+ 33 Share on Facebook 39 Share on Twitter Total Shares78 Applications News Google has just pushed out a blog post that indirectly outlines a few changes to Google Trips. We reported last month that manually adding reservations and support for bus and train tickets had been added to the app. This latest post by Google shows off some additional features, like easy itinerary sharing and new reservation types like restaurants and car rentals. For those out of the loop, Google Trips is a pretty sweet way to keep all your itineraries and reservations together in one place on your phone. It includes the ability to save all the info offline, in case data might be limited wherever you are traveling. It can bug out, sometimes, doing things like placing reservations in duplicate trips, or just failing to properly crawl your email for reservations, but it's still a solid tool. Unfortunately these most recent feature additions — itinerary sharing, restaurant, and car rental support — aren't showing up for us quite yet, though they are demonstrated in Google's latest blog post. Itinerary sharing is probably the single most requested feature for Google Trips, and a more than welcome addition I know I want. Google's promotional images for the feature seem to show the app isn't using the standard icon to denote sharing, which is a bit inconsistent. If you'd like to take a look for yourself feel free at the Play Store or APKMirror. Download QR-Code Google Trips - Travel Planner Developer: Google Inc.

Paul_Werner Now if they'd only take my feedback on the "Day Plans" & make it where you can plan our days with it automatically selecting only places you've stared 😌 Sonic Sunglasses Hopefully they fixed the problem that made me quit using the app: when a friend emailed me their flight itinerary, Trips added their flights to MY itinerary with no way to correct the mistake. Ryne Hager There should be a "delete from google" option in the overflow menu when viewing a trip in-app. ike3232 it's a great app, in theory. but it actually isn't picking up my flight itinerary from my gmail. it is only picking up my hotel reservations. lame Michael Maggard Basically what Tripit tries to do.

Next month, Ubisoft will release Star Trek: Bridge Crew, a VR experience from its Red Storm studio. It puts you and three others in command of a starship’s bridge, manning stations as you take on several situations. You may be rescuing stranded spacefarers. You may be blasting Klingons. You must work together with others, all in VR. Sure, you could replicate this on standard PCs, with everyone connected with headsets and playing online. But you wouldn’t get that immersiveness that only VR can deliver. And this is what makes this medium so exciting. I just hope that EA and Disney get their acts together and put me in a VR version of one of the 1990s’ best starfighter sims — TIE Fighter.

There aren’t many images of the device available yet, though it looks very different from the traditional square-shaped HeroCams we’re used to seeing. (via UploadVR) How Fashion Brands Are Using VR Who said VR was just for gamers? From Sephora’s latest AR app update, a VR perfume commercial starring the one and only Kate Moss, to a HoloLens powered dressing room–the fashion industry has proven that VR and AR is en vogue through a range of experiences over the years. (via VR Scout) Wilson’s Heart review So far, virtual reality’s main argument has been exotic placement. My Oculus Rift situates me on the peak of Everest, the moons of Saturn, the depths of the Pacific. I crane my neck, mouth agape, to suck in the sights I might otherwise never see.

Source: Shutterstock The interesting part, though, is not anticipation of a new device or expectancy of some revolutionary program rollout. Rather, the focus is expected to heavily surround the Windows 10 Cloud OS and management’s intentions to shift significant attention to the education market. CEO Satya Nadella will, apparently, be allocating a larger portion of the company’s resources to wage war against tech behemoth Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) in the classroom arena. Both Microsoft and Google each sport their own classroom services that offer teachers and students alike the opportunity to learn, work and collaborate using a variety of tools designed to increase efficiency and cultivate a productive environment. However, despite having equally robust and functional Classroom products, MSFT has struggled to gain ground against GOOGL since the official release of Microsoft Classroom in April 2016. Comparatively, Google Classroom has been around since August 2014 and, for the most part, it has been very well-received across the country by professors and teachers as well as students ranging from elementary school-age up through universities and grad schools. Why Google Has an Advantage in Classrooms Many investors have wondered why MSFT would be willing to spend such time, money and resources to get its software in front of elementary school-age children. Well, last year, shortly after the debut of Microsoft Classroom, Fortune’s Barb Darrow answered that question, explaining: Tech titans know that if they want to expand their customer bases, they’ve got to get ’em while they’re young. That’s why Google and Microsoft have targeted teachers and younger students with special editions of their bread-and-butter software packages. The idea is if you learn to type on Microsoft Word or Google Docs, you’ll keep typing and working on one of those options for life. That’s the rationale behind the companies’ respective Google Classroom and Microsoft Classroom franchises. With this in mind, the battle for dominance in classrooms across the country makes a lot more sense. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), which has been battling Microsoft in classrooms across America since the release of its Apple IIe desktop computer in the 1980’s, was in a solid position to maintain top market share with the iPad release in 2010. Almost immediately, the iPad became a nationwide hit with teachers and students alike, and by 2013, Apple devices accounted for nearly half of all shipments to classrooms, while MSFT devices only accounted for 29%. And so the war waged on, as it had for more than three decades prior, with AAPL and Microsoft vying for the attention of America’s pupils in hopes of establishing a lifelong brand loyalty by putting their devices in classrooms across the country. Meanwhile, all along GOOGL had been laying the groundwork for making further inroads into educational institutions by marketing Google Apps for Education, which integrated with Google Drive and Gmail.

Bloomberg Share Comment Read Article Larry Page has his flying cars. Sergey Brin shall have an airship. Brin, Google co-founder, has secretly been building a massive airship inside of Hangar 2 at the NASA Ames Research Center, according to four people with knowledge of the project. It’s unclear whether the craft, which looks like a zeppelin, is a hobby or something Brin hopes to turn into a business. “Sorry, I don’t have anything to say about this topic right now,” Brin wrote in an email. SERGEY BRIN Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store → The people familiar with the project said Brin has long been fascinated by airships. His interest in the crafts started when Brin would visit Ames, which is located next to Google parent Alphabet Inc.’s headquarters in Mountain View, California. In the 1930s, Ames was home to the USS Macon, a huge airship built by the U.S. Navy. About three years ago, Brin decided to build one of his own after ogling old photos of the Macon. In 2015, Google unit Planetary Ventures took over the large hangars at Ames from NASA and turned them into laboratories for the company. Brin’s airship, which isn’t an Alphabet project, is already taking shape inside one. Engineers have constructed a metal skeleton of the craft, and it fills up much of the enormous hangar. Alan Weston, the former director of programs at NASA Ames, is leading Brin’s airship project. Weston has a background befitting such an unusual enterprise. Born to Australian parents, Weston spent some of his youth in Turkey and then ended up at the University of Oxford. There he became a key member of the Dangerous Sports Club – a group of very intelligent risk-takers that formed in the early 1970s and did things such as catapult people across fields into nets. Members of the club are credited with inventing the modern form of bungee jumping. Weston, for example, performed one of the first bungee jumps by hurling himself off California’s Golden Gate Bridge and then eluded the authorities waiting to capture him on shore. He also hiked Mt. Kilimanjaro in Africa and then attempted to hang-glide down, only to crash and hurt his ankle in the process. Years later, Weston joined the Air Force and did engineering work as part of the U.S. government’s Strategic Defense Initiative – known more broadly as the Star Wars missile defense system. In 1989, Weston oversaw one of the first tests of Star Wars, which aimed to destroy incoming Russian missiles midair with weapons fired from space. Following his stint at the Air Force, Weston joined NASA and worked on a wide number of projects, including the development of a low-cost lunar lander. In 2013, Weston described plans for an airship that could be used to haul cargo. The idea is that airships could be more fuel-efficient than planes and could carry loads directly to where they’re needed, rather than to transport centers like airports or shipping stations.

At Amazon, he led development of Kindle tablets, the Echo voice-activated speaker and other devices. He was a marquee hire for Alphabet Inc.'s Google, made just as the internet search giant unfurled the first wave of its own branded devices. Foster didn't immediately respond to a LinkedIn message seeking comment. At Google, Foster stepped into a new role, vice president of hardware product development, working on the company's Pixel smartphone and Home speaker, an Echo competitor. His sudden exit marks a setback for Google's gadget ambitions -- the company is planning to release at least two new Pixel smartphone models this fall, according to a person familiar with the company's plans, who asked not to be identified discussing private matters. The hardware division also competes with Apple Inc., Amazon and other companies building devices tied to intelligent software, like digital assistants, that could upend existing models for media and advertising -- markets that Google now leads. A Jefferies LLC report this week said hardware "should be a meaningful revenue driver" for Alphabet. The company, which reports first-quarter earnings Thursday, doesn't break out device sales. Foster had reported to Rick Osterloh, the former Motorola executive Google hired last year. Google isn't planning to replace Foster, a person familiar with the company's plans said. Before Amazon, Foster worked at hardware groups at Microsoft Corp. and Apple.  Earlier this week,  German publication WinFuture reported that it uncovered evidence of three planned Google devices in Android code information online. --With assistance from Ian King.

On Wednesday, just two days after Page’s Kitty Hawk startup published a video of a “flying car” prototype zooming across a lake, news surfaced that Brin is building a blimp. Brin’s zeppelin-like project is taking shape inside a hangar just two miles from Google’s Mountain View, Calif., headquarters. The hangar is part of the NASA Ames Research Center, which in the 1930s housed a Navy-built airship named the USS Macon. Bloomberg News reported that Brin’s airship isn’t affiliated with Google parent Alphabet, but it couldn’t determine if Brin’s blimp is for business or pleasure. “Sorry, I don’t have anything to say about this topic right now,” he told Bloomberg in an e-mail. SEE ALSO Alphabet launching test of incredibly unsexy self-driving cars 0:0 Alphabet’s is launching a big self-driving car initiative – and,... Leading Brin’s project is former NASA Ames program director Alan Weston, who developed for Ames a prototype of a helium-based airship designed for lifting payloads up to 500 tons. Indeed, Weston says airships could be more fuel-efficient than planes or even trucks, and could carry loads directly to their destinations, sidestepping shipping hubs and airports. “New airship technologies have the promise to reduce the cost of moving things per ton-mile by up to an order of magnitude,” Weston said in an interview. Brin should hope for better success with his blimp than the Navy had with the USS Macon, which crashed near Big Sur in 1935.

On Friday 14 April, the engineer sat down in the San Francisco office of Waymo’s lawyers to face six hours of hard questioning. When asked what his current responsibilities were at Uber, Levandowski took the 5th, citing his right under the U.S. Constitution’s Fifth Amendment not to answer questions that might incriminate him. He plead it again to questions about whether he stole the files, and again when asked if he subsequently used the files to build lidars for Uber. In fact, he took the 5th over 400 times in the course of the day. The transcript of the deposition, released on Friday, is predictably repetitious. Despite that, it is one of the most illuminating documents to emerge from the lawsuit so far, revealing Google’s early suspicions of Levandowski, details about key suppliers, previously secret code-names, and technical details of the lidars in question. Here’s what I learned, and how: 1. Questions can be just as informative as answers Although Levandowski’s answers were identical, I learned a lot from Waymo’s questions. It seems Waymo now thinks that Levandowski was deceiving Google almost from the moment it hired him to work on Street View maps project back in 2007. Google first had concerns when it found out that Levandowski was working with his own start-ups, 510 Systems and Anthony’s Robots, to build a self-driving car, as first revealed in IEEE Spectrum.  “When Google discovered that you were involved in 510 Systems and Anthony’s Robots, it was concerned about potential conflicts,” said Waymo’s lawyer, David Perlson. “You used confidential information from Google to help develop technology at 510 Systems; correct?” He went on to accuse Levandowski of using Street View code to calibrate 510’s Velodyne lidar, and in the start-up’s self-driving car technology. 2. Levandowski names his lidars after mountains Perlson said that the lidar Levandowski built at 510 Systems was called Little Bear, after a mountain in Colorado. “The Fuji system at Uber is named after Mount Fuji,” he went on. “And the reason that the Fuji system at Uber is named after Mount Fuji is that it is derived from Google technology that was also code named with names of mountains.” Perlson revealed Google’s lidars are all named Grizzly Bear, probably after Grizzly Peak in Berkeley, where 510 Systems was based. The latest Waymo lidar is called Grizzly Bear 3 or GBR3. 3. The side hustles kept coming Perlson accused Levandowski of controlling a company called Dogwood Leasing that hired ex-Google contractor and 510 Systems engineer Asheem Linaval to use Google’s secrets to develop self-driving car technology. Linaval was eventually hired to Levandowski’s autonomous truck start-up Otto, which Uber bought in 2016. Waymo also accused Levandowski of founding yet another start-up, Odin Wave and feeding it confidential lidar technology. In 2013, one of Google’s suppliers called Google because it had received an order from Odin Wave that was similar to parts used by the technology giant. Perlson accused Levandowski of then moving Odin Wave and renaming the company Tyto, to hide his involvement. 4. Be careful what you file The 184-page transcript of Levandowski’s deposition was heavily redacted by Waymo’s and Uber’s lawyers to obscure commercially sensitive information. But unique among the court’s filings, the transcript included an index that had been generated before the redactions were made. By cross-referencing the redactions with the index, I was able to uncover almost every word that the companies did not want made public. For instance, I discovered that the company supplying both Google and Odin Wave with lidar components was OMW Corporation, a high-tech contract manufacturing business based in the Bay Area. 5. A shared supplier ecosystem Perlson then asked Levandowski: “Did Otto select third-party vendors because of their knowledge of Google’s confidential technology?” Uncovering the redactions reveals that Perlson asked whether Otto had ever used three particular optical component companies while developing its laser technology. It seems likely that these are key suppliers for Waymo’s lidar. The issue came up again in reference to Uber. In December 2015, another supplier, which redactions reveal to be Gorilla Circuits, accidentally sent an email intended for Uber engineers to a  Waymo employee. The email included a circuit design for a lidar that Waymo believes replicates its secret technology. 6. An Owl and a Spider lidar “You used confidential information from the 14,000 files you took from Google to develop lidar at Uber; correct?” Perlson asked Levandowski during the deposition. He went on to name three specific devices: the Fuji lidar that Uber is working on now; the Owl lidar built by Tyto; and, redactions reveal, a previously unknown lidar called Spider. Spider is the pre-Fuji design that Waymo recently accused Uber of hiding, and whose existence first emerged from a filing Uber made with Nevada regulators in November. Waymo believes Spider to be essentially a copy of its Grizzly Bear 3 lidar. 7. Technical similarities The redactions also show the specific technical details in Uber’s Fuji lidar design that Waymo thinks it can trace back to its own patents and trade secrets. Waymo sees similarities in the spacing and placement of diodes on the Fuji’s printed circuit boards (PCBs), including having tiny diodes hanging on the edge of the PCB. It also suspects that a cylindrical lens assembly and guide holes for pins are derived from confidential information that Levandowski took from Google. In addition, Perlson asked Levandowski about Uber’s progress on ion-doped laser fibers for lidars, which both companies are working on. 8. Levandowski’s early life Finally, Perlson let Uber’s lawyers ask Levandowski a few questions that he was prepared to answer, mostly about his life and work outside Google and Uber. His responses show that Levandowski’s entrepreneurship started at an early age, selling candy to fellow students in high school, then building a website to navigate photos of the school buildings. He made his first self-driving vehicle using Java and Lego Mindstorms at UC Berkeley, before building a (partly) self-driving motorcycle for DARPA’s Grand Challenge competition in 2004. He also claimed to have worked on Velodyne’s first commercial lidar. “After the [second Grand Challenge], I helped them get their unit from the early, early prototype that just outputted video data… into outputting Ethernet packets so that others could use it,” said Levandowski.  A judge ruled Tuesday that Levandowski’s Fifth Amendment rights did not extend to documents that Uber controls. The next milestone in the epic lawsuit is a hearing on 3 May to decide Waymo’s request for a preliminary injunction to halt Uber’s self-driving car efforts. That could be all the more critical for Uber, given that Waymo just announced that it would expand its trial of autonomous minivans in Arizona to over 500 vehicles.

Opinion: Google should fix its erratic reminder system Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/26 2:15pm PDTApr 26, 2017 14 Plus 1 on G+ 52 Share on Facebook 46 Share on Twitter Total Shares112 Applications Editorials Google Article Contents 1 Input methods 2 Quick Access 3 Notifications 4 Allo and Home 5 Conclusion The ability to quickly set a reminder on your phone is one many of us take for granted these days. Smartphones have seemingly always had this basic PDA functionality. Type ‘add reminder’ into the Google search box and you’ll be able to quickly set up a notification to jog your memory about something later on. You can even use the ‘OK Google’ voice command: “remind me to pick up the groceries at 6pm,” for example. Easy-peasy. For most people, this function is used occasionally for something really important they simply mustn't forget. And for those people, it probably works just fine. However, for some people (like me) reminders have become an absolute necessity. I hate to admit it, but I have a really bad memory. Truly awful. For this reason, I am almost entirely dependent on Google’s system of reminders to navigate through each day. My phone will buzz with a reminder around 15 times per day. Some of these are one-offs. Some are recurring. All of them are to remind me to do something important, and without them, there’s no telling what I might forget to do. Don’t get me wrong, I am incredibly grateful that I am able to set reminders on my phone at all. But my extensive use of Google’s reminder system has also led me to conclude that it is inherently flawed. The biggest issue, as I see it, is a lack of consistency. Allow me to explain. Input methods There are currently no fewer than 6 distinct reminder input methods available to a typical Android user: Google app (including Google Assistant on compatible devices) Inbox Keep Calendar Chrome Allo Assistant With so many options, there’s always a convenient way to add a reminder to your Google account, whatever you happen to be doing when the need arises. Not all reminders are created equally, however. Add a reminder using any of the first 3 methods in the list and you’re offered the same basic options, such as when or where you’d like to be reminded and if you’d like the reminder to repeat. Inbox insists on using its ‘snooze’ terminology to denote reminder time, which isn’t ideal but we can handle that. Keep reminders are obviously linked to a specific note so you may not always want to use this option if you’d prefer your notes list to stay nice and tidy. They do still show up in your reminders list on the Google app, though, and can be dismissed from there accordingly. You cannot edit Keep reminders from within the Google app, however. To do that you’ll have hit the “Open in Google Keep” link and go through to the app itself. A Keep entry in the Google app's reminders list. If the experience already seems a little messy, it’s when you add a reminder to the Google Calendar app that things start to get weird. Firstly, these entries default to an ‘all day’ event, which seems a little counter-intuitive. It’s not difficult to change this to a timed reminder, but it's a slight annoyance that this option isn't the default. Secondly, unless you have the ‘Reminders’ box checked, which makes all of your reminders visible in your Calendar, none that you set here will actually deliver a notification. Having this option checked may not be a problem if you have one or two reminders set over the course of the week. But as I’ve already explained, I have many, many more than that. So when I set the Reminders calendar to be visible, in order to have the notifications working, my Calendar looks like this… My eyes!!! It even includes distinct entries for recurring reminders. So if you have a reminder set to recur every day it will show up in the month view for every single day, rather than just the next instance. The result is a mess. Needless to say that completely rules out Google Calendar as a method of input for me. Unfortunately, it took a couple of missed reminders when I didn’t have the option checked to figure out that the calendar functioned in this way. This was obviously frustrating, and I was lucky not to miss out on even more important notifications before I realized they weren't showing up. Another potentially handy way to set a reminder is by searching ‘add reminder’ on the Google homepage in your browser (on desktop or mobile). Regardless of browser or OS, if you’re logged into your Google account you should be able to easily set a reminder this way. Of course, there are a couple of limitations here too. First of all, there is no option to set a recurrence if you use this input method. You can revisit the entry in the Google app later on and set a recurrence there, but that kind of defeats the purpose of being able to add it in your browser in the first place. The second issue is that you can only set the reminder for predetermined times of the day. These include morning, afternoon, evening or night, as well as set times of on the hour (12:00) or half past the hour (12:30). This simply isn’t specific enough for certain tasks, and as a result, I tend to steer clear of adding reminders this way (except in an emergency), preferring the other more feature-rich methods. Quick Access At the moment there isn’t an especially fast way to enter a reminder input from your Android phone’s launcher. The ‘OK Google’ hotword (or Google Assistant on compatible devices) is easily the fastest method currently available, but there are still many of us who don't wish to talk loudly at our phones in public. Or even in private, for that matter. It's also worth mentioning that if you use the voice method this can often lead to misunderstandings or having to type extra information anyway. The Screen Search reminder button - simply not fast enough. The easiest solution would seemingly be to have a one-tap option to go straight into a reminder from your device homescreen. Instead, we have to long-press of the home button (on non-Assistant devices) which brings up Screen Search (previously Now on Tap) and click the pink Reminder button, or we can type ‘Add reminder’ into the search bar or Google app. Both of these routes often feel painfully slow. We do have app shortcuts for Calendar and Keep, which is great. But each app comes with its own feature limitations, discussed earlier, which preclude me from considering either as a viable option. If only the Google app has an "Add reminder" app shortcut or widget, the process would be a breeze. App shortcuts - why can't the Google app copy this approach? If you want to view and manage your reminders list there are several ways to do so. The Google app has a reminders list in the menu, and this is probably the most complete, robust way to manage them. Inbox displays them as pinned items in among your emails, or you can filter out everything else and view them in their own list, which functions similar to the list in the Google app. You can also snooze these in Inbox just as you can with emails. Keep has a section showing any notes that have reminders set against them, but doesn’t concern itself with any reminders not attached to one of its own notes. Lastly, Calendar (as you can see in the image further up) displays every single upcoming reminder alongside all of your other events, rendering it practically unusable. Notifications More examples of inconsistencies across these apps can be found in the notification shade. How each reminder is displayed and the quick actions associated with each vary widely. To dismiss this I must mark all 8 as ‘Finished’, including two I can't even see. When you have multiple Google app reminders they are bundled together in a single notification, rather than separated out into individual items. The only action you can perform is to mark all as ‘Finished’, dismissing every one of them at once. Another thing to remember is that notifications in Nougat only show up to 6 lines of content per app at any one time. So, in the example above there are two reminders I can’t even view without entering into the app. When you do enter into the app to mark individual items complete, that dismisses the notification from the shade entirely. If you were hoping to leave it there for the rest of the day as a glanceable to do list, you’re out of luck. Calendar reminder notifications similarly give you only the option to mark as done, but where they improve over the Google app is that you can tap into each individually and edit the reminder time on the next screen. This won’t affect the other notifications from the app. Inbox notifications are bundled rather more usefully, with each being individually expandable and giving the option to either mark as ‘Done’ or to ‘Snooze’. This offers you greater control over your tasks. While this is much closer to how it should be done, Keep refines this even further. Its notifications are also unbundled and come with two individual actions to choose from, snooze for an hour or snooze for even later. Swipe away the notification and you dismiss the reminder altogether, condemning it to the ‘Past’ section of the reminders list in the Google app. The exception being recurring reminders, which will still come back the next time they are set to recur. This is arguably the best way to handle reminder notifications, but you have to be happy to clog up your Keep list with reminders in order to utilize this. Keep's reminder notification - best in class. Your Google Now feed is yet another place you can interact with your reminder notifications. There, it’s possible to snooze reminders for an hour or mark as finished. But there seems to be little rhyme nor reason to how long reminder cards remain actionable in Google Now. It’s not uncommon for me to see a notification in Google Now long after I’ve dismissed it elsewhere, and vice versa. While the cards remain useful in some instances, this isn't a reliable way to manage your task list. Allo and Home Some of you may have noticed that I haven’t mentioned how the Google Assistant in Allo handles reminders. That’s because for some reason these reminders are kept completely separate from all those discussed above. They won’t appear in any of the other apps and can only be viewed in the Allo app when it notifies you. The notification is displayed as a message from the Assistant itself and it doesn’t appear as though you can snooze it at all, not even if you ask really nicely. Allo isn’t the only way to interact with the Google Assistant, of course, the other being Google Home. You might think that reminders would be a key function of the smart home device, but curiously you still can’t ask Home to remind you of something, months after its release. Even the addition of multi-user support hasn't yet brought with it the ability to add reminders. Much has been written about Home and Assistant still feeling like beta products. With omissions like this, it’s hard to disagree with that. Conclusion By experimenting with Google’s reminder system across all of these apps and interfaces, it’s probably possible to eventually find a way to make it work for you. I would argue that you shouldn’t have to work quite so hard to utilize what is in essence quite a basic service. I’ve tried countless other Android apps in a bid to satisfy my reminder needs, and effectively replace my defective memory. But nothing seems to hit the right balance of good design, usability, and features. Plus, there’s no substitute for being able to easily access my reminders from any device on which I can access my Google account, something Google’s reminder system still boasts over every other option on the Play Store. Still, there has to be a way to merge all of these separate interfaces and functions into a less frustrating experience. I'm sure this isn't a huge priority at Google, but I can dream, can't I? A discrete Google Reminders app would seem an obvious solution. One that plugs into the other Google services but ultimately acts as a standalone master-app might be the best way to alleviate some of these shortcomings and offer the experience I expect from a service like this. Then again, maybe it’s just me. Maybe I’m the only person who uses reminders to quite this extent and I should, in fact, seek help. Hopefully, that’s not the case. And hopefully someone at Google uses reminders just as much as I do, and with just as much frustration. Tags allo calendar google app google assistant google home inbox keep subscribe ...

Anything I set using voice is getting marked as done within 10 minutes of them notifying me. At first I thought I was crazy, I was seeing reminders in my Inbox that I had set while driving, but an hour later I'd say to myself "Wait didn't I set a reminder to do X?", only to find I HAD created the reminder, but it was marked as done. I can't figure it out! I opened a ticket with Google only to have some rep tell me I needed to clear my cache, but it still happens even when all my devices are off and browsers closed. Kevin Luther Yup. They have been really messed up. I keep finding them marked as done when j never even got the notice Simon Levin Yes that happens to me all the time. I've come to not rely on reminders for anything serious. catalysto I regularly encounter quirks like this with Google reminders. It's for this reason (and all the other stuff Scott said) that I only ever interact with them via Inbox. Fortunately, I enjoy using Inbox, so using that method is relatively painless for me, but for those who don't... Well hopefully the nightmare ends soon. A centralized reminder database/app seems to be the best solution. ShahinTr I just use events. I never bother using reminder, it's an absolute waste of time and space on calendar. Charles222 I've largely abandoned reminders in favor of calendar events and todoist. Todoist in particular, since it has equally-favored apps for the three OS's I use and Home support. David Ruddock Todoist seems very robust. I always consider trying it, then just don't because most of my reminding comes from calendar events, as you say. I want the solution to feel as integrated as possible. Scott Scrivens I have tried Todoist but I didn't like it. I don't actually remember why though...maybe I'll give it another shot. Waveblade Second on Todoist, just replacing it outright is better and the interface is way better than any other ones I've used. The other thing is context awareness is great. "Send email today at 4PM #" will figure out where it all goes. That is the killer feature about it wheelingdad If you need to set 15 reminders a day then you might look inward instead of trying to create/change a system that fits your issue. Just saying... Scott Scrivens pls halp Bruce Wayne Exactly. 15 reminders in a day is just absurd. I saw one of his screenshots and there was a reminder to "charge his phone". That says it all. Matt That calendar is what Leonard from Memento would have if they made that movie today. XerBlade Everything was just peachy for me using Inbox's reminder tools for all of this... until recently. For the last couple weeks, Google has made an incredibly asinine change where time-based notifications will automatically be marked as Done in just under an hour if you don't do it yourself. Which really mucks things up when you're, what's a simple example that's easy to convey... Say you set a reminder a while back that you forgot about (which is pretty much why you set a reminder in the first place), and it goes off while you're in a movie (and you didn't adjust it to go off later on after you're back from the movie beforehand because, you know, you don't have eidetic memory which is why you need reminders in the first place). Said reminder goes away on its own before the movie ends, so you never actually see it. That kind of BS has been happening to me DAILY since this started. [Notifications you just leave sitting in your inbox forever and never "Snooze" are fine though. Yay.] Kevin Luther I have been missing so many reminders lately as well. It's utter garbage destinyhud Here is what i do. I use google app to set all reminders. it will flow to calendar and keep is just for note taking. Now i set calendar events for more important thing to be reminder me a second time just to be be careful like my monthly mortgage Scott Scrivens This is essentially what I do currently. I wish it just worked from everywhere though. blahmoomoo Allo's subscriptions are kind of broken anyway, though I don't know if that also applies to recurring reminders. I told Allo to tell me the weather every morning, but if you don't chat with the bot on occasion, it stops doing that after about a week. Then I forget that it was supposed to remind me about the weather for a few days after each time that happened. So I have ultimately given up on it. EDIT: to be clear, the subscription is still there. It just forgets to keep sending it after a while if you don't talk to the bot, intentionally or not. 4Ui812 Google needs to fix more than just the reminder system. This is probably the least of their problems. Grey They should also bring Reminders to Gmail. Why is it Inbox-only? The other Inbox feature, Email Reminders, should be baked into the next version of Google. After that, what makes Inbox different? Jason Bell The biggest issue I've been having is that reminders don't always give me a real notification. It's always there in the Google App when I open it, but sometimes there's no notification. sam1331 I was just looking into this today. I've become increasingly dependent on reminders, and basically use it as my to do list these days. However, it definitely could be improved. The thing about the notifications is huge, if I have multiple pop up I have to click on the notification to dismiss one, and then the others are no longer sitting there in my notifications. Then I have to reschedule them to get them to sit there again, which is the whole point of the entire system. If they disappear from my notification shade, how will I remember to do them? I might as well not even use Google's reminder system at all then. It's just so convenient to type "remind me to..." in the search box and have it add whatever it is. MisterAlex I recently got a reminder notification for a "when I get home" reminder that I'd set over a year ago. No freakin' clue what made this particular arrival at home special enough to trigger it again... :v Jen Once they get all THIS stuff straightened out, I'd love the ability to set reminders by Time AND Location. For example, I'd love to say "Remind me to do laundry when I get home tonight" while I'm still at home in the morning... Right now, that would just "remind" me immediately since I'm still at home, or if I set it to a specific time, it might remind me before I get home in the evening or after I've been home a while. It'd also be useful for locations that have open/close times, like stores, where a location-only reminder won't be helpful if you frequently walk by at a time when it's closed. Having a Time + Location context would be immensely helpful! N8SLC This works for me. I use the assistant mostly. Scott Scrivens This. This would be so useful. PHLAK I also rely on reminders heavily. Hover, I limit myself to just using them through Inbox (both on the web and phone) to avoid all this complication. A stand-alone reminders app to "unify" reminder functionality would be awesome. Crossstick You & me Scott. I'm on a 12 person sales team plus a manager. NO ONE, but me uses automated reminders. I can't live without 'em. Ever since the original Palm Pilot ! Keep is my main workhorse for the past couple of years. Alex Renna This is the reason I switched to using a To-Do app (Todoist). There used to be a Gmail add-in (#todo) that stopped development after Google implemented Reminders on Calendar, and acted like you stated, only one occurrence that would move days until it was completed. If that made a come back I would be a happy man. kimbo I haven't had to make any reminders recently but I thankfully haven't experienced these issues before Cakefish I use Keep reminders a few times a month for important stuff like meetings and deadlines. Dozens of reminders a day? I wouldn't want to be that dependant on technology to function properly in everyday life. I can usually remember the mundane everyday stuff pretty well on my own, such as remembering to buy food and eat it, drink to keep myself hydrated, charge my phone when the battery gets low, go to the toilet, breathe in and out etc. Everyone's different though! Each to their own. Shakil Shaikh Jut install Tasks, the app formally known as Astrid: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.tasks Workflow wise, resizable/fiterable widgets do it for me (they also provide a quick way to enter a categorised task). Persistent notifications help in some cases too. Mostly though, it's the only to-do app that offers recurring tasks on both scheduled date (every 3rd Monday) or on completed date (3 weeks since last completed). It'd probably be quicker and healthier than waiting for Google to create some kind of compromised workflow for you instead. Scott Scrivens I was actually an avid Astrid user back in the day. Miss that little octopus. My issue with this as a solution is that I always need to use my phone. I'm looking for cross-device/platform integration. LaserWraith I tried to use Google's reminders in the past but gave up for reasons similar to yours. Todoist keeps me on track now across all my devices and it's pretty great. Some flaws still, but a big improvement. Raymond Berger Have you tried TickTick? I've been using it for years and it was been absolutely fantastic. It works across many platforms and has a relatively simple interface but also plenty of options for power users. Trip66 Been using it for years I love it...Bought it Immediately.+1 N8SLC You can de-select the reminders calendar. As for the rest, I think the sheer volume is on you. ;) Scott Scrivens You can, but then any reminder you set using Calendar won't work. Deeco PREACH AP!!! Please make more articles like these to highlight these simple anoying flaws. Let us be heard and get Google off​ their backside! ellett Why can't a reminder play a sound? As it stands now you can get an email or have a notification pop up, but everything is silent, which is useless if I'm doing something else when the reminder triggers. If I need an alarm, I have to set a reminder several hours in advance to remind me to set a phone alarm. Sophie Yes, many of these things have been bothering me, too! The state of Google's reminder system is much like their chat/messaging apps: confusing and fragmented (Ok, maybe it's not as bad as the chat/messaging apps). Like the author, I also rely on reminders (my calendar looks alot like his!). I primarily interact with them through the Google app, as well as a script I wrote for the Linux command-line that allows me to quickly add timed reminders (Google calls them quick events) to a special "My reminders" calendar (I wish I could save them to the default Reminders calendar that Calendar and the Google app seem to use, but it seems off-limits to developers). If Google's voice-to-text translation was better, I would stick to the Google app, I really don't mind talking at my phone, in public or otherwise, but it's not great. I have to correct things so often that I might as well type it in half the time (hence the command-line script). bdbplatano 🍻 Here's to hoping Google's paying attention🍻 Wolfie410 My biggest issue had to do with recurring reminders set through Google Now/Assistant. I was unable to clear a reminder ahead of schedule, without completely deleting the future occurrences of the recurring task. The only other option was to wait for the notification to pop and then dismiss it. Not very convenient. Have beem using the splendo to-do list. Rudresh Another way is to set an alarm with a note, works best for me. Lateef Alabi-Oki I wonder how hard it is to create a single reminder service, with a consistent API and behavior, that all their front-end services and third-party apps can use? Just thinking out loud here. Bruce Wayne I can't imagine why you would need a reminder to charge your phone. Trip66 Many of these shortcuts can be added to the homescreen in most launchers and especially in Nova but I use the OK Google method and several times a day. "Remind me in one hour that at 2pm so and so is coming by to.... That type of stuff... and I plan my whole day everyday so I don't forget someone is coming by or I have to be somewhere etc etc. It's a godsend to me and I can do it all hands free and 90% of the time it's in the car via BT. Awesome.ability. I fix computers all day so I'm always picking up or dropping off and also people drop and pickup to me so it reminds me when so I dont leave if someone is coming over or I have to be to their place at a specific time. But I haven't had any issues with them being marked as done or anything and they always go off at the time I say to.

Inbox app has the widget and it's quite neat and inclusive of all the features. Luzandro I also use the inbox widget, which works quite well for me, except when the shown presets for snoozing aren't appropriate (which is quite often the case for me, as the soonest suggestion is in the evening) it takes surprisingly many steps to choose something different TedPhillips yesss. the bundling gets me since if i finish one reminder but have a few overlapping (but not too many like you), need to be very aggressive but also careful about notification shade grooming. out of sight out of mind and all that. A+ Simon Levin Thank you. If only Google cared to fix their old products. Nathan J For me, reminders have always been crap on both platforms. On Android, I used an app called Lotify. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nll.lotify The nice thing about this app is that you have a ton of options, and a huge selection of icons to choose from, so if you have a lot, they stand out from one another. I expected iOS to be leaps and bounds ahead, because an iPhone just works, right? Not so fast. I found iOS lacking in that regard. Via Reddit, I found an app called "HiFutureSelf" that simulates a text message. You put in the message and the time you want to receive it. You can set a unique ringtone for the app. And when the time comes, you get your message. It suits my purposes. There might be better options, but I haven't seen any, personally. Ryan Warmack Business calendar pro hits the nail on the head for me. ilovetesla can anybody petition google to make adding birthdays and anniversaries to calendar easy Alicia Frederick Inbox has a widget you can add to the home screen on your phone for single tap quick access, which might help with the notifications since Inbox does them better. Jeremy Couch One thing that I hate is that when you dismiss Android notifications of reminders from Keep they mark it as Done. So I stopped using Keep for reminders. Very annoying. Ste Tan Excellent article. Reminders have been a pain for me as well throughout Google services. I've tried so many different apps—apps like todoist,etc— that just isn't as convenient for me compared to a native solution by Google. I eventually just went back to using Calender and keep for reminders and though it does become aggravating, I've grown to just deal with it since I need to use it daily. A Google reminders app would be perfect, especially since it would seemlessly sync and work consistently throughout all my Android devices plus any other device I have my Google account connected to. I really hope Google sees this article and takes it into consideration. Fabian Todt personally i like how google calender reminders show up, that's exactly how/why i use them: these are tasks/todos i have to do at this very moment so they are like an event/meeting. this is somehow similar to the getting things done method: i've got all tasks in todoist and plan them as reminders in calender when i have to do them. Neil S The article says that there is no widget for reminders that can be added to the home screen. I have one on my phone. The Google inbox app has a reminder set up widget which is quick to use. Just tape the reminder widget button and enter the reminder text, then hit the clock icon to set it for any time you like and to repeat if you like.

Google Photos v2.14 is preparing personalized experiences and sharing suggestions based around facial recognition [APK Teardown] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/04/26 5:08pm PDTApr 26, 2017 21 Plus 1 on G+ 40 Share on Facebook 39 Share on Twitter Total Shares100 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News When the Photos app launched in 2015, Google had already been working on computer vision for many years. It was no surprise that object recognition was a major draw for the app, and automatic sorting of pictures by person with the use of facial recognition became a must-have feature. Google is now looking to leverage this technology to make the Photos app a bit more social. A teardown of the latest Photos update reveals the service will soon offer additional features based around facial recognition, and even encourage users to share pictures with the people detected in them. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. Since facial recognition is a sensitive privacy topic, it's worth a quick sanity check to reduce confusion and knee-jerk reactions going into this teardown. Everything discussed here is opt-in and the features will not work if users do not select a photo of themselves, and that means nothing can happen accidentally or without granting permission. Furthermore, most of the features are only slightly modified versions of existing aspects of the app and pose no additional risk to privacy. I'll leave it up to each reader to determine how they feel about the remaining functions and their practical implications. Face recognition for personalization, sharing, and more Instead of opening with the reason this feature might be useful, I'm going to jump straight to a summary of how Google is going to present it. Quite simply, the Photos app is going to ask users to "personalize" their experience by selecting a picture of themselves from the list of previously identified faces. If you already named yourself, the group might be renamed "Me" after making the selection. <string name="photos_facegaia_optin_impl_title">Personalize Google Photos by labeling your face</string> <string name="photos_facegaia_optin_impl_desc">Which face is yours?</string> <string name="photos_facegaia_optin_impl_picker_face_picker_title">Select your face</string> <string name="photos_facegaia_optin_impl_confirmation_toast_msg">All set! Try searching for “Me”.</string> Face recognition isn't just the tool, it's actually part of the pitch to get users interested. Google's explanation is broken up into two parts, the first of which offers to reward users for choosing a face with "personalized search, creations, and more." <string name="photos_facegaia_optin_impl_detailed_desc0">Get personalized search, creations, and more based on your face?</string> Personalized search is explained by the toast message above – it just means you can search for "me" to find pictures of yourself. I assume "creations" are the same auto-generated albums, collages, and animations we usually see in the Assistant tab, but obviously focused on you, the user. Both of these sound like things we have now. <string name="photos_facegaia_optin_impl_detailed_desc1">Allow your contacts' Google Photos apps to recognize your face in photos for faster sharing? &lt;a href=help:&gt;More&lt;/a&gt;</string> It's the second part of the explanation where things get interesting. If you have identified your face for Google Photos, you can also give permission to have the app on other people's phones recognize you when pictures are taken. To be clear, this can only happen for people if they are in your contact list and if you've given permission for it to make matches.

settings for managing the new facial recognition features, but they are just there to turn the grouping features on and off, or to change the face you selected in the past – perhaps you tapped on the wrong mug during setup, or maybe had plastic surgery, I guess. code <string name="photos_settings_faceclustering_advanced_face_recognition_setting_title">Face grouping</string> <string

My biggest question is what users will see after they take a picture of somebody else and a match is made. Primarily, will the photographer be prompted to share the photo, will it quietly include some visual marker that somebody was detected, or will it remain quiet and simply make intelligent suggestions if the share button is pressed? A big feature like this is probably not going to trigger quietly, so I expect notifications, but that could get pretty overwhelming after something like an office party or family reunion. Unfortunately, I'm sure there are many unanswered questions, and since the implementation isn't done and there are missing pieces, there aren't going to be answers quite yet. The potential problem for features like this is that they tip-toe right up to the line where many people feel uncomfortable about potential privacy issues. It looks like Google has done a good job of designing barriers to avoid some of those issues, and it's clear users are responsible for making their own decisions. It's important that this is an opt-in feature by default. I do like the idea of using facial recognition to smooth out the rough edges of sharing photos with people, especially if it also acts as a reminder. I admit, I have a bad habit of taking pictures of friends and forgetting to share them later. If this goes well, Google might have the killer feature that turns Photos into a must-use service.

Morten Ulv You'll be able to archive photos you don't want in the main photo view. Then it'll be safe to show photos to your family. Southern Discomfort Yep, see this as super profitable for the big G. Knows your face, scans all your pictures and notices a slew of recent pictures all showing Best Buy in the background. Guess what shows up in your Gmail inbox within moments...?? Yeah, I don't know. This sounds like the tide turning type of thing and is actually kinda spooky for me. I get that Goog does this type of thing, but dang... Willie Chalmers III I really doubt that's going to happen. It's a slippery slope, and if they wanted to do that, they likely would have done it by now to some extent, and people would notice. James Briano Oh, Google already knows. When I search Drive for "Best Buy" I get a lot of interesting results. Example attached. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/45ff7b47285e47474877510e0456d559a7344aca80b48062d208178aa0e33897.jpg Theo Logian There is likely location data attached to that photo rather than image recognition of that big yellow tag. tik Yup... location based versus recognizing text in the image. trekker Photos face recognition is brilliant - especially when visiting a friend and quickly being able to find photos from the past to enjoy together. However currently they decide who gets a name label (or tag) and this means i have many people who remain unsearchable. Please can we manually add names ourselves? The system where Google provides choices for names does not work. whispy_snippet "you can also give permission to have the app on other people's phones recognize you when pictures are taken." Doesn't Google Photos already effectively do this? If I go to the auto generated "people" album I can see a whole bunch of photos of people clustered via facial recognition. Yes, I had to turn this feature on and individually label people, but the end result is now effectively the same. My app recognises faces. Jens M Eichkorn What's new is that it will associate faces with actual names / Google accounts whispy_snippet Sure, I understand that. But what I'm trying to say is that if a user chooses to do so, they can make Google Photos do this already. The tear down gives the impression that a person needs to opt-in to allow their face to be recognised in images taken by someone else. What I'm saying is that I can already go into my Photos app, enable face recognition, label some faces and bam, I'm getting the same result. This teardown suggests people can soon can opt-in to something that's already effectively live anyway. What seems new is that the process looks more streamlined. But I'd have thought many people would be more concerned with a right to opt-in to facial recognition, not a right to opt-in to a more streamlined process. Am I making sense? I feel like I'm not articulating myself well here. JG Doesn't Google Photos already effectively do this? From the article: Furthermore, most of the features are only slightly modified versions of existing aspects of the app and pose no additional risk to privacy. whispy_snippet Ah yep, I must have missed that bit. Well it makes sense. But yeah, I guess my other key question still stands - why is there a need to give people the option to opt-in to something that's effectively out of their hands? Your face can already be recognised in someone else's Google Photos "people" album. David Hyman What if it knew you were together and it automatically shared the pictures with other people. Basically automatically creating a shared album Paul_Werner I'd love that Kevfromspace Any news on printing Google Photos albums a la Apple Photos Books? tik Definitely excited with all of the new updates.

Bloomberg Larry Page has his flying cars. Sergey Brin shall have an airship. Brin, Google co-founder, has secretly been building a massive airship inside of Hangar 2 at the NASA Ames Research Center, according to four people with knowledge of the project. It’s unclear whether the craft, which looks like a zeppelin, is a hobby or something Brin hopes to turn into a business. “Sorry, I don’t have anything to say about this topic right now,” Brin wrote in an email. The people familiar with the project said Brin has long been fascinated by airships. His interest in the crafts started when Brin would visit Ames, which is located next to Google parent Alphabet Inc.’s headquarters in Mountain View, California. In the 1930s, Ames was home to the USS Macon, a huge airship built by the U.S. Navy. About three years ago, Brin decided to build one of his own after ogling old photos of the Macon. In 2015, Google unit Planetary Ventures took over the large hangars at Ames from NASA and turned them into laboratories for the company. Brin’s airship, which isn’t an Alphabet project, is already taking shape inside one. Engineers have constructed a metal skeleton of the craft, and it fills up much of the enormous hangar. Alan Weston, the former director of programs at NASA Ames, is leading Brin’s airship project, according to the people, who asked not to be named discussing the secretive plans. Weston didn’t respond to requests for comment. Weston has a background befitting such an unusual enterprise. Born to Australian parents, Weston spent some of his youth in Turkey and then ended up at the University of Oxford. There he became a key member of the Dangerous Sports Club – a group of very intelligent risk-takers that formed in the early 1970s and did things such as catapult people across fields into nets. Members of the club are credited with inventing the modern form of bungee jumping. Weston, for example, performed one of the first bungee jumps by hurling himself off California’s Golden Gate Bridge and then eluded the authorities waiting to capture him on shore. He also hiked Mt. Kilimanjaro in Africa and then attempted to hang-glide down, only to crash and hurt his ankle in the process. Years later, Weston joined the Air Force and did engineering work as part of the U.S. government’s Strategic Defense Initiative – known more broadly as the Star Wars missile defense system. In 1989, Weston oversaw one of the first tests of Star Wars, which aimed to destroy incoming Russian missiles midair with weapons fired from space. Following his stint at the Air Force, Weston joined NASA and worked on a wide number of projects, including the development of a low-cost lunar lander. In a radio interview in 2013, Weston described plans for an airship that could be used to haul cargo. The idea is that airships could be more fuel-efficient than planes and could carry loads directly to where they’re needed, rather than to transport centers like airports or shipping stations. “New airship technologies have the promise to reduce the cost of moving things per ton-mile by up to an order of magnitude,” Weston said in the interview. “It depends on the size of the airship. A larger airship can reduce costs a lot more than a smaller ship, but there’s design of a class of vehicles that can lift up to 500 tons that could be actually more fuel-efficient than even a truck.” He went on to describe a prototype he was considering of a helium-based craft that appeared to breathe. “And so the way that works is that the helium in the main envelope is taken and stored in bags inside the airship at a slightly higher pressure,” he said. “As you do that, air is taken in from the outside into essentially like lungs that are attached in the side of the vehicle. So the analogy of breathing is a good one. And the overall lift of the vehicle is equal to the weight of the air that is being displaced by the helium. And as you change that, you can control the amount of buoyancy that the vehicle has.” This technique, according to Weston, would allow the airship to carry 500 tons without the need for a ballast. After being contacted about the airship, Weston changed his profile on LinkedIn to list his current job as chief executive officer of “Ltare.” He then removed the post. There have been many attempts to build airships of this type in recent years. It’s fitting for such a project to take place in Silicon Valley, which seems to have entered a steampunk phase, as people race to build things ranging from flying cars to tiny reusable rockets. Brin’s airship is separate from a freight project called Calcifer that was shelved by Google X, the company’s experimental research lab, in 2014. Alphabet CEO Page, Brin’s Google co-founder, has funded at least two secretive flying-car projects – startups Kitty Hawk and Zee.Aero, also separate from Alphabet. Page has begun to take the wraps off one of these efforts – on Monday, Kitty Hawk released a video showing one of its all-electric vehicles taking off and soaring over a lake with the driver perched on top.   Most Read Work set to start on new Seattle Children’s clinic in Everett EVERETT — After years of planning, construction is set to begin here… Apr 25th, 2017 by Sharon Salyer Everett man investigated for extortion, cyberstalking MUKILTEO — An Everett man has been accused of extorting a woman… Apr 25th, 2017 by Caitlin Tompkins Everett mirror maker says knock-offs have cost it millions EVERETT — Electric Mirror is fighting to protect manufacturing jobs in Everett,… Apr 26th, 2017 by Dan Catchpole Proposed assisted-living facility, housing project in same area EVERETT — Sunrise Services, a 40-year-old operator of adult group homes, plans… Apr 25th, 2017 by Chris Winters Budget deal secures pay hike for state troopers OLYMPIA — A big pay hike from lawmakers and a large graduating… Apr 25th, 2017 by Jerry Cornfield © 2017, Everett Herald and Sound Publishing, Inc.

Google's new search tools and changes could help combat fake news Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/25 10:37am PDTApr 25, 2017 18 Plus 1 on G+ 34 Share on Facebook 58 Share on Twitter Total Shares110 Google News Since time immemorial (1998) Google's bread, butter, and raison d'être has been search. Now Google's changing the way search works a bit, empowering users by adding new feedback tools and changing results from their search ranking to bring you more relevant and accurate information. With these changes users should see less in the way of so-called "fake news" and other non-factual content (excluding searches for that material), and more accurate and relevant information pertaining to their search. The biggest user-facing change you are likely to see is probably the new feedback link. It allows users to tag snippets —the short bits of text you might see that directly answer questions posed in a search —or autocomplete results as being accurate, inaccurate, offensive, or just disliked. There's no telling yet exactly how Google may or may not use the data collected via reports, but at a minimum it may go some way to prevent a few of the problems they've seen. I know in the past I've seen snippets come up that are either entirely incorrect or totally unrelated to a search. Hopefully this doesn't just present a new vector for further rank manipulation in autocomplete, though. The changes to search sorting are pretty straightforward. Google's had some problems in the past with sites manipulating how they appear on results. After all, anything that's governed by a set of rules can be gamed using those rules. Even without that Google's had some problems with factually inaccurate results appearing on top of results. They'll be making new changes to ranking to avoid that sort of thing in the future, and they're redoubling their efforts with Google's human oversight in determining quality of results. Their content policy has been updated with the details, and their educational portal on how their Search works has also been changed. Until we see how searches are changed there's no way to know if the new tools might open another means for manipulation of results. While it's possible some might use it as a means of censorship or calumny, hopefully the system is robust enough to resist that type of manipulation. Either way, we shall see.

Luciano Damn, MJ was spot on. He said you're coming and here you are! F4LL0U7 Well yesterday's March For Science post is a pretty good indication of how this comment section is about to play out... M. Luciano I must have missed it - wtf is controversial about supporting science? F4LL0U7 A lot, apparently! Check it out. http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/04/24/went-protest-app/#comment-3271548575 Sir_Brizz I think it's wrong to simplify both the "March for Science" and whatever happened in that comments section to "supporting science". Most people would agree with "supporting science" but it is rarely that simple. If you don't understand what problem a reasonably intelligent person would have had with the march or that post, then that probably warrants further investigation on your part to form your own opinions. M. Luciano I was surprised to hear that there was any controversy over the march for science. Science seems like one of the most uncontroversial things one could "march" for. The article didn't mention any controversy, unless people creating an app to collect data at protests is controversial, but then almost every app on every platform would be controversial. Nicholas Conrad It wasn't a march for science, it was just called a march for science. It was a march in support of a particular set of policy prescriptions. Anyone who really supports science would know that science can't be in favor of one policy or another, it can only inform the discussion of costs and benefits of varying policies which then have to be weighed. F4LL0U7 However, PEOPLE can choose to march for or against a cause. These people were marching *against* decisions made by the government that seem to ignore scientific research, and *for* awareness of the cause. And science can certainly favor one policy or another. For example, cutting the EPA by 30% and removing regulations that protect the environment -- it's pretty safe to say that if you consider scientific research, you would not make those decisions. Nicholas Conrad No, that's the problem. Using your personal political views as a proxy for pro/anti science is *very* anti science. F4LL0U7 Ok I'll bite. If that's the case, then what scientific arguments are there that defend the deregulation of industries that create the most pollution and damage to the environment? I'll offer my own take on it, and absolutely feel free to counter. The current administration takes the stance that those industries *don't* harm the environment significantly. They believe the harm done is outweighed by the boost they predict to employment, the economy, and their own profits. I can cite Trump's Earth Day tweets as an example of this stance. In taking that stance, they are either ignoring scientific evidence of harm to the environment, or choosing to diminish its value. That is an anti-science stance, and one of the many reasons these people marched that day. Scientists are telling the world that certain things are major priorities right now and require immediate action. When politicians ignore or deprioritize scientific evidence for the sake of their own priorities, that is anti-science. Nicholas Conrad Why is it a given that the epa is optimal at it's current funding levels, do you have evidence, or are you assuming because you like what they stand for? And trump isn't targeting the epa specifically, he's spoken out against the larger 'regulatory state'. It's perfectly coherent to argue that laws should be passed by congress, not unelected bureaucrats (working under the executive branch, bt-dubs, so shrinking the regulatory state actually diminishes trumps power while increasing democratic engagement in policy making... you'd think it was something we should all be able to get behind) even if there are some good ones on the books that will temporarily be displaced. But the real issue is your (and the marchers', and for that matter the general pubic's) confusion between the statements "science says" and "scientists say". It's a cheap *appeal to authority* fallacy, one which, when questioned about it scientists usually (very conveniently​) say 'well yes, but it doesn't count when *we*'re the authority'. Then you look at the structure of modern academic 'science', where advances in computer-aided statistical analysis, paired with clever research design allow researchers to almost guarantee a 'significant' result, which is important because their carriers depend on *publishing*, not on finding truth. So much so that a full 2/3rds of 'peer reviewed' studies don't hold up under replication. Science *is* self-correcting, but on the time scale of decades and centuries, not months and years, so whatever cause du jour is backed up by 'the latest studies' is most likely to be wrong. If people are really interested in supporting *science* they should be marching on campuses demanding more rigor in academic publishing standards which were established centuries ago, not marching for x or y policy, about which science is agnostic. F4LL0U7 I certainly respect your argument, and greatly appreciate your well thought out points (in stark contrast to the insult-spewing posts of some other commenters on here). But I respectfully disagree with you. The sentiment that laws should be passed by Congress and not unelected bureaucrats is sound. You can definitely make the claim that the Trump administration is advocating for deregulation for selfless reasons. But you seem like an intelligent person -- do you really believe that? Trump has not divested from his businesses, and his appointees and friends will directly benefit from deregulation. Isn't it much more likely that they care more about their profitability than the environment? You're discounting the validity of scientific research due to perceived flaws in the system (which is a reasonable thing to do), but failing to acknowledge the common sense that's so obvious when you follow the money. Humans have come to rely heavily on industries that pollute the environment. That pollution has very real negative effects on the environment. You can doubt the validity of that all you want -- those effects can be seen with your own eyes. (What do you think causes the smog in Beijing? Do you think it's nothing to worry about?) In order to stop and hopefully reverse some of that damage, those industries must be regulated. They certainly can't be trusted to regulate themselves. The US has it better than other countries, but can and should be a world leader on this front. The people invested most heavily in those polluting industries have the most to lose from regulation. Those people now have the ear of those in charge (and in many cases, actually are the ones in charge). They will continue to make decisions in the best interest of their industries, as opposed to the environment. That is how science gets politicized, and why scientific facts get challenged by people in these industries. Science should always be challenged and tested, but for purposes of advancement, and not spun for profit. Of course they're not going to come out and say it's for the benefit of their own bottom line. They're going to pay their own scientists to come up with research that supports their own agenda, and then lobby friendly politicians to vote in their favor. Have you ever wondered why cigarettes are still legal? Nicholas Conrad Look, reasonable people can disagree, or at least they used to be able to (I think we're doing a fine job). So your argument is: "trump likes corporate profits at the expense of the environment, and I like the environment at the expense of corporate profits". That's fine, I agree with you, but those are both preferences people can have and science doesn't take sides there. All science says is: 'one way the Earth will warm slower, the other way global wealth will rise slower.' Personally I think our grandchildren will be better equipped to deal with the consequences of global warming with a few extra trillion in global GDP than a few degrees Celsius shaved off the average global temperature. Those are trade-offs science can help define, but ultimately people can prefer different outcomes without being 'anti science'. Is trump a scumbag? Certainly. Is he an idiot? For sure. Does that mean that supporting the opposite of his views is inherently pro-science? Not remotely. As to your point about oil company studies that fossil fuels don't contribute to global warming, or tabacco company studies showing no link between cigarettes and cancer, because there's an inherent conflict of interest, I'd say you're right to be skeptical. Even with no funny business on the part of the scientists involved, we know that subtle factors (like who signs your paycheck) influences the outcome of research. Agreed? Good. Why then do we not examine the conflict of interests of government funded studies that consistently suggest the agency that funded them should have more power and funding? M. Luciano Furthermore, a Google search for "March for Science Controversy" turns up no controversy. Just a bunch of articles explaining who and what is going on. Is there an actual controversy? People supporting the scientific method and it's application to the challenges of our current world and society... that's not controversial. abc The controversy is that these morons think climate change is a Chinese hoax, and science (and frankly common sense) tell us that it's not. So controversy!! Sir_Brizz I don't know if there really is a controversy. However, I didn't find many of the signs people were holding to be very pro-Science even though they presumed to be. It kind of snipes any "movement" when there isn't really a consistent message and people are undermining it by their own stupidity. Nicholas Conrad Clearly a media conspiracy; is mj lamestream?

Why bother if you standard of quality is mainstream media? Vivek Rameses So they're censoring what the govt doesn't agree with? Is this new China? FernandoRocker No. Just made in China. M. Luciano What? No. The government isn't mentioned, at all and that's not how it works. They're 1) Not censoring anything and 2) Trying to promote accuracy in search results Vivek Rameses If I were to use Google at least I won't see any CNN, Fox news and the likes. That would be a plus. rebretz000 I think the fact that a tool like this is needed is biggest problem. I can't believe that there are persons out there so gullible that they will believe almost anything posted online. Averix A lot of people don't cross check articles and only read headlines. Sites that base their existence off of ad revenue by getting people into a "click hole" of fake news stories have the psychology of morons figured out. David Warthen We must get rid of the fake news so you can be inundated with all the real news that's completely made up. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ As long as I can filter out /r/the_donald I think that will take care of the majority of it. F4LL0U7 Heads up, a handful of users you've never seen on AP before are about to rain their barely literate rantings upon you. As an example, check out the March For Science post from yesterday. A Person People who attend science marches only push their belief in science when it suits their interests, not when it comes to male is male and female is female. M. Luciano Did that make sense when you wrote it? A Person Yes, it makes sense. M. Luciano What exactly is the scientific understanding of the relationships between sex and gender? We could try sociological, biological and psychological. Let us know when you're ready to read up on the hundreds of peer reviewed studies and provide an analysis. F4LL0U7 People who say things like that have likely never had a child, relative, or friend who turned out to be trans. And even if you haven't, why not try having a little empathy? Life might be more enjoyable, and you might be less angry at things that have absolutely no impact on you whatsoever. A Person That is very selfish of you to enforce others believe or acknowledge something simply because you yourself have experienced. If you have a friend, child, or relative that thinks they should have been the opposite sex, and you didn't attempt to get them psychiatric help, then you dropped the ball. F4LL0U7 I'm sure I should just block you and end this waste of time, but I'll ask anyway: do you think homosexuals need psychiatric help as well, or do you think that's a valid way for a person to live their life? A Person I'm sorry, do all homosexuals think you can switch back and forth between male or female, or whatever other gender you want to make up? If that is the case, then we can talk. I see "other person typing"... but sorry, I'm out... you people are batsh!t crazy. fijisiv Dude keep it up. I have never seen somebody so proud of their ignorance! Is it painful to watch? Is it sad? Is it humorous? Yes. F4LL0U7 Really? Never? (Had to bring it all back around to Devin's OP) https://az616578.vo.msecnd.net/files/responsive/embedded/any/desktop/2016/07/30/636055042891058227364682665_2.jpg Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Kudos to you and @disqus_DIvkrvAJjQ:disqus for attempting to educate @disqus_abcdefg:disqus, but sadly it seems they would rather hide in their little hole and pretend the world is black and white. F4LL0U7 Hahah, thanks! Where were you? Your body was ready, and we needed you! Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ I had meetings all day and kind of forgot since all the responses came off your comment and not mine so I got no emails! F4LL0U7 Haha, I'm just kidding. I do it to myself -- I enjoy it! Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Reading over everything really just wants me to respond to some of the comments but I know it'd be futile. Alas. F4LL0U7 You'd have to take a survey. But I would bet that most of them would be open to modern science, empathy, and leaving people the hell alone. That question was just a litmus test for your level of tolerance to other humans that may or may not fall into your perfect worldview. Sir_Brizz I'll vote for leaving people alone, although that is something that is rarely afforded to others. Nathan Walters You're the one refusing to acknowledge empirical evidence and human experience. Pot, meet kettle. MJ Holy Crap! I could have sworn that I BLOCKED (fixed) you long ago. Dude, stop with your endless ignorant comments. You have never said anything resembling intelligence on any subject here. Are people really this dumb or are most of them actually just trolls? Impossible to tell or know I guess... F4LL0U7 If you're out, does that mean you're not coming back, and I don't have to bother blocking you? Nathan Walters Wait, do you even know what science has to say about issues of biological sex? I'm guessing not. A Person Science says there are two genders, not Facebook's 58... or whatever count they're up to now. F4LL0U7 Sure, if the most recent science book you've read is the bible. A Person LOL... I haven't said anything about the bible. You're a guy or a girl and whatever logic you want to make up in order to twist two genders into 50+... well, let me get my popcorn. M. Luciano This is just as false as it was 4 minutes ago. Most people are a guy or a girl or both, but some are neither. F4LL0U7 I'll refer you to @disqus_DIvkrvAJjQ:disqus's post above, since they've already done the research, and I have to get back to work. Si vis pacem, para bellum So, you believe in Evolution right? What about talking about races then, is it OK or are races "a social construct"..? Assuming you believe in the existence of races, are we all physically and mentally equal? What are the differences, both physically *and mentally*, between the races? You say you believe in science and you also say that there is nothing wrong in the Social Justice agenda. The 2 are just as incompatible as science and believing in Biblical literalism. M. Luciano You're wrong. "Science" holds 8 known sexes and three known genders. The sexes are X0, XX, XY, ZZ, ZW, WW, Hermaphrodite and asexual. The genders are male, female and neuter. This does not include chromosomal anomalies, such as XXY, XXYY, X and XXX. A Person lol... This is like if I were to argue that "tires can only be round", so your argument becomes "round isn't the only shape". M. Luciano No, it's as if you said, "people are male or female" and then I stated that the scientific understanding is that people are one of eight sexes and one of three genders. Because that's what actually happened. So you were incorrect because you were ignorant of the actual information available to you, now that you have it, you can learn. A Person Dude, I brought up gender and you brought up sex. Why do SJWs like yourself feel it necessary to complicate things as much as possible? M. Luciano You used them interchangeably with Nathan Walters, so figured you wanted to know that they're different. But even if you want to stick to gender only, there are 3, not 2. A Person I didn't use them interchangeably. I brought up gender. He then brought up sex. I didn't bring up sex. This is ridiculous. M. Luciano He brought up sex, you then referred to it as gender ... either way, 3 > 2. And either way, it has absolutely nothing to do with the overall topic of search results. F4LL0U7 The world is complicated, dude. And if something as simple as rethinking your pronouns can make life a little less complicated for people who are having a hard enough time as it is, then why not do it? In your mind, is being a Social Justice Warrior a bad thing? Seems like fighting for social justice is something to be proud of. F4LL0U7 More accurately, it's as if you said "tires are the only things that allow vehicles to move" and then @disqus_DIvkrvAJjQ:disqus cited tank treads, skis, wings, and propellors as other examples. A Person You're right, he/she/ze/it/them/they sounds even crazier when you put it that way. F4LL0U7 Maybe this concept wouldn't be so difficult for you if you spoke another language. Most other languages besides English have gender-neutral pronouns. If English did, then maybe you wouldn't be so offended by having to consider someone's gender identity before referring to them. Si vis pacem, para bellum "Most languages"..? Which are all of these many languages..? To my knowledge it's English that has a gender neutral pronoun ("it"), in my mother tongue, Italian, and in the others derived from Latin like the French, Spanish, Portuguese and Romanian languages, *everything* has either a male or female gender. For example a chair is female, a table male, the language is male, a word female... Also, the ZW chromosomal system is only for birds and some fish and insects, there are only 2 sex chromosomes in humans and the other mammals and you correctly call chromosomal *anomalies* (which are also very rare) any combination which doesn't produce either a male or a female. A person born with 3 legs does not mean that the human species has either 2 or 3 legs... abc Sure. Let's face it you're too stupid to know what a chromosome is. So let's stick to fixing tires . Nathan Walters There aren't even only 2 sexes, why should the existence of more genders come as any surprise? abc lol. Google hermaphrodites. I love when a moron claims science backs up his opinion, when it's so obvious to a 5th grade science student that you're a numbskull. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a1ca661e6cd51072403c87d1161ea33d1aa68181de414832321558ead5d02819.jpg Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8f111e2cbfab6a1ab9e37e4dcb1b4e74b67793df6767debf1233b63590f83b15.jpg F4LL0U7 It's funny because 1) you think I'm a Democrat, and 2) you are hours late to this discussion and are making the same exact mistake as @disqus_abcdefg:disqus. abc I presume the joke is that you're too fucking stupid to know what a hermaphrodite is? kr3000 Excellent, a right wing news blocker. Because diversity of thought is like fascist and stuff. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ It's one thing to think differently, it's another to spread false information. C Lo What could possibly go wrong... Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Bahahahahaha! As if I trust Google. I tried this myself with Google vs. Duckduckgo, searching for "Hillary Clinton is a". The results for Google have changed slightly, but they're still flattering. Duckduckgo still suggests criminal, liar, crook, murderer, etc. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/50818a751a00330950eceeca37a2b4d6b8f74ee8691ca9854e4ade9962a6264e.jpg F4LL0U7 Try that with any person in Google and you'll see the same discrepancy. Google already explained this (several months ago, welcome to the party!). They don't associate people's names with negative words in autocomplete. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ That's funny, because I get "Donald Trump is a" cheeto, dinosaur, democrat (now THAT is an insult) on Google. In fact, I get a lot of insulting suggestions for other people. "Bill O'Reilly is a" wife beater? So your explanation does not pass the smell test. F4LL0U7 You won't get suggestions about Trump being a liar (despite video evidence) or a crook (despite him settling out of court for defrauding attendees of his "university"). Google simply does not suggest terms like that. Here's an idea -- Google it. It was in the news almost a year ago. Doby Gillis Seems you need to look up safe space since you're acting like a special, little, snowflake. Bruce Wayne Google is notoriously liberal so it's no surprise that they suppress negative comments about a liberal former presidential candidate and boost negative comments about a Republican president. I just looked up "Hillary Clinton is a..." and I got democrat, war hawk, hologram and hero. I did the same for Trump and got dinosaur, cheeto, gemini etc. And Google expects us to trust them with filtering for "fake news". HA! F4LL0U7 If that's how you're using Google, you're doing it wrong. Google filters out suggestions tying a person's name to crimes and obscenity. This was all over tech news a year ago. I would expect Bruce Wayne to be on top of things like this. If you don't like Google's search results, use a different search engine. Scott Will the Google App get search tools?? D.Smithee How about they combat the absolute deluge of fake reviews in the Play Store. Geezus. Stormprobe But Google is a liberal company, so they are for fake news. Teppka You do not need Google to protect yourself from fake news. Just stop watching-reading CNN, BBC and other neocon-controlled media.

Today Google has announced that the Assistant inside the Home is going to learn 5 million recipes over the coming week. Once this rollout is complete, the device will be able to help you cook, by giving you instructions for any of those recipes. To use the functionality, go to Google Assistant on your Android phone or use Google search to find a recipe. Pick what you like and hit the "Send to Google Home" button. Then, once you're ready to cook, tell your Home: "OK Google, start cooking" or "start recipe". It will answer with the list of ingredients to gather, and then walk you through the entire recipe. If you aren't sure about something, you can always ask it to repeat. While you're following the recipe, you can have it play music, ask it about conversions, or tell it to set a timer.

Google Assistant can now lend a hand in the kitchen, assuming that's where you've placed your Google Home speaker. An update rolling out to all users this week will give the digital voice assistant access to more than 5 million recipes from Bon Appetit, The New York Times, Food Network, and other sources, and it can read them all back to you step by step. If you want to search through all 5 million, you'll first want to select a recipe via web search on your iOS or Android device, or via the Google Assistant if your phone has it built in. Once you've found the one you want, tap the "Send to Google Home" button so it knows what you want to cook. You can also ask Google Home for some recipes directly, such as "Ok Google, let's make macaroons." Related 200 Things to Ask Your Google Home 200 Things to Ask Your Google Home Once you've got all the ingredients ready, you can say "Ok, Google, start cooking." You can then ask Google Home to move on to the next step in the recipe, or to repeat the instructions for a specific step. In between, you can set timers with your voice and also ask all manner of questions that an experienced assistant should know the answer to, such as how many ounces are in a cup. Of course, given a choice between cooking dinner with Google Home tonight or seeing the hit musical Hamilton, it's a safe bet that most people would chose the latter. And while asking Google Home for tickets isn't likely to work, the company on Wednesday made available a deluge of historical information about Alexander Hamilton's life to beef up your historical knowledge in case you do get to see the musical. The collection, curated by the Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History, includes six virtual reality tours of locations where the founding father spent his time, from his home in Manhattan to the site of the duel in Weehawken, N.J. where he died. The VR tours are available to students using VR headsets on the Google Expeditions platform, but the Institute has also uploaded much of its Hamilton collection for anyone to explore.

By simply saying the “Ok, Google” command, you’re supposed to be able to ask your Home almost any question and/or request that it do something for you. So, assuming that a large number of our readers own a Google Home, what do you use your Home for? UAG Samsung Galaxy S8 Cases In an effort to catch up and potentially beat the Amazon Echo, the Google Home is gaining new abilities and features every couple of weeks. The latest one, announced this morning, is the ability to read over five million recipes to users. This new feature, though, is just one of the many things Google Home is great for. In addition to the ability to quickly start and stop alarms and timers, Home can be programmed to turn on your lights and work with other home automation items. One of the best parts about it is the fact that the Google Home has a built-in speaker so that you can listen to music off of it. Plus, if you want audio played elsewhere in your house, the Home can cast audio to other devices that are connected to the Chromecast ecosystem. So, if you own a Google Home, what do you use it for? Have you become reliant on its functionality? Answer the poll below and let us know your thoughts in the comments!

Image Credit: Jordan Novet / VentureBeat Google today announced an update to its Gboard virtual keyboard app for Android that will make it easier to edit and enter text. The feature first became available to the app’s beta users, and now it’s rolling out to everyone. You can get to the new feature by tapping on the G button or the arrow in the keyboard’s top right corner, then hitting the new icon for text editing — a cursor with arrows pointing left and right — in the suggestions area, Google product manager Linda Lin wrote in a blog post. From there, you’ll see some big buttons pop up. There are arrow keys pointing up, down, left, and right; a select button in the middle; keys to go to the beginning or end of your text block; buttons for cutting, copying, and pasting; and, of course, backspace. If you hit select and then move around with the arrow keys, you can select exactly the characters you want, and from there you can cut, copy, or paste. Because the buttons are so big, for some people this system will be easier than delicately dragging the pointers to select text. The feature is not yet available on Gboard for iOS. Google is pushing out this feature after beginning tests of a new Copyless Paste feature in Chrome for Android, which will let users more easily enter text into other apps based on usage. Gboard has 500 million to 1 billion app installs on Android, and that popularity has to do with the fact that the standard-issue Google Keyboard for Android was folded into Gboard a few months ago. That followed the introduction of Gboard as a separate app for Android. But when Gboard first came out, it was only on iOS, despite that Android is of course Google’s own mobile operating system. Other keyboard apps that let you type by gliding like Gboard include SwiftKey and Fleksy. ABOUT CONTACT CAREERS ADVERTISE Terms of Service Privacy Policy © 2017 VentureBeat. All rights reserved.

Google App 7.1 beta is testing a search bar in the notification panel and may begin showing pollen counts [APK Teardown] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/04/26 5:12am PDTApr 26, 2017 64 Plus 1 on G+ 108 Share on Facebook 74 Share on Twitter Total Shares246 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Article Contents 1 Teardown 1.1 Search bar in the notification panel 1.2 Pollen counts 2 Download The Google app is responsible for a pretty staggering number of features ranging from the standard search interface, a voice assistant, and even a fully functional launcher. The latest update coming through the beta channel doesn't seem to have any new features going live quite yet, but there are a lot of changes to text and other resources, including the removal of all references to Bisto from the last teardown. Most of them are minor tweaks to features we've covered in the past, but a couple point to things we haven't explored yet. Users can look forward to pollen counts with their local weather and possibly a search bar located right in the notification shade. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. Search bar in the notification panel It looks like Google is testing a new location for the quick search bar. A new setting in the apk describes placing a "search bar in the notification panel." The setting doesn't appear to be live yet, even on the Android O developer preview, which isn't surprising since it's marked as a beta. Before you assume this is going to be just another quick access tile like the toggles for Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, let's be clear that the phrasing specifically says the search bar is in the notification panel and the word "tile" is never used. It could be worded incorrectly, which sometimes happens with unofficial features, but this sounds too specific to be a mistake. code <string name="search_notification_setting_title">Search bar (beta)</string> <string name="search_notification_setting_summary">Show quick search bar in the notification panel</string> <string name="accessibility_notification_google_search_button">Google Search</string> <string name="accessibility_notification_settings_button">Notification Settings</string> <string name="accessibility_notification_voice_search_button">Voice Search</string> res/xml/search_notification_preferences.xml <PreferenceScreen xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"> <SwitchPreference android:persistent="true" android:title="@string/search_notification_setting_title" android:key="persistent_search_notification_enabled" android:summary="@string/search_notification_setting_summary" android:defaultValue="false" /> </PreferenceScreen> Since the Android OS only allows very limited access to the UI of a notification, this probably won't be implemented as a regular notification. Contrary to the point I made above, it obviously still could be a simple quick tile that displays a search bar floating on top of whatever screen you're currently looking at. I'm going to venture another theory or two, although I admit this is crossing deeper into guesswork. This clue might suggest Google is planning to modify the notification panel itself to include a space for the search bar, possibly inserting it between the quick settings tiles and the actual notifications. I'm not sure many people would want a search bar in that spot, but it's not implausible. We can take that theory one step further, probably crossing into the realm of the unlikely, to raise the possibility Google could be planning to open up the notification panel to app developers even further and allow full-width widgets to be placed there. There are certain things that can't be done with either quick settings the tiles or regular notifications, so there is at least some justification for adding this capability, but it still feels unlikely. We might find out more about this as Android O gets closer to launch. Regardless of the specific implementation method, we can return to the original question of whether or not most users would want a search bar in the notification panel. Would it be redundant if there could already be a search bar on their launcher and long-pressing on the Home button can open up Assistant, or would this just give us another option if those don't fit our workflow? Since it's a beta, we may not get much more about this for a while. Pollen counts In my neck of the woods, as with the rest of the northern hemisphere, we're in the middle of Spring. That means we're enjoying warmer temperatures, sunnier skies, and longer days. For some, it's also time for unending fits of sneezing, itchy eyes, and all of the symptoms of hay fever. I don't personally suffer from this, but plenty of people do, and keeping tabs on the pollen count can be helpful for making plans to keep the allergies in check. Judging by a new image in the Google app, this information is about to get a little more visible. Titled ic_pollen_count.png, it's pretty clear what this flower image (that looks like it's sweating) will be used for. I expect it to show up with the standard weather predictions, much like it does on some other trackers and news outlets. It's a simple feature, but one that will surely be invaluable to millions of users around the world. Seeing as we're already in the middle of Spring, there's no better time for this information to go live, and probably could at any time. Hopefully it's sooner rather than later. Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way. Rather than wait for Google to push this download to your devices, which can take days, download and install it just like any other APK.

Filipe Santos GOOGLE, I DON'T CARE, just give me Assistant on my 6P!!! Frisi I think you should have it. Most phones have it by now. Sam I still don't have it, either :( Yash Raj Chhabra Change language to english us. Give ur phone a restart and you should have assistant. Vratislav Jindra Be glad you don't have it, Assistant sucks (at least when compared to Google Now). It can't identify songs. It broke AutoVoice (a Tasker plugin) integration. You can't type to it, you always have to speak. Long pressing home button always comes up with the assistant screen, and there is no shortcut to go to the Google App itself. I just hate it, that's all. Cody Toombs The AutoVoice plugin can kinda already be solved with IFTTT for some actions, but doesn't really give the full range of capabilities. I think that's going to get better once some of the other features for Assistant are opened up. As for speaking your input, that's already in the works. It was mentioned in a previous teardown, and I'm a bit surprised it hasn't gone live yet. (link) Tim Lewis For quickly accessing Google Now (which I use to get a quick run-down on the news), I use Action Launcher and just have a shortcut set to open the Google app when I tap the home button when I'm already on the home screen. mattcoz Yes, I hate that you can't type. I don't want to talk to my phone, especially in public. Fernando Pena I have it already... 6p, developer preview, english language. demarcmj Forgot to finish that last sentence... "Seeing as we're already in the midst of the season that could benefit from" Imparus From what? The suspens is killing me :O Cody Toombs ^ The reason I shouldn't write these on so little sleep. :) Thanks, got it fixed. I was just saying this pollen count feature could launch at any time, and probably should soon. abqnm Thanks for the teardown! Also, your sleep-writing got you again. PP 6: There are certain things that can't be done with either quick settings the titles or regular notifications... Feel free to nuke this comment after reading it. Cheers! Cody Toombs Ahh, thanks. Good catch! Trooper311 Thanks for the write up Cody. I have noticed something of late with the Google app. I thought it was because I was on beta, but I got off of beta and it still does the same thing on my Pixel XL. Also on my wife's Moto X. For the weather cards, instead of saying the town that I am in, it states the township that I am in. This travels with me wherever I am. Home, work, a store etc. Any news on this by chance? Thanks. Cody Toombs I live in a place that barely exists, so I've always been bumped into neighboring areas. For that reason, I never really notice when things like that behave abnormally. Sorry. Trooper311 It's ok man. Appreciate you hitting me back. Cheers. CasperTFG #oceans11 Carson Saldanha Search bar in the notification panel seems pretty legit to me. DragoCubed Full-width widgets in the notification bar? Yes please. Search bar in the notification bar? Not so exciting Dennis Ulijn Can the search bar in the notification panel not be a reply line, like you get in messaging apps like hangouts, messages and whatsapp? Bombaglad i imagine that could be pretty easy to implement it that way for any 3rd party dev as a separate app (please correct me if i am wrong) Multiling O Keyboard Yes, I'm thinking to add app shortcuts to it with my Renegade Launcher app. ilovetesla whats the use of a pollen counter?? Cody Toombs "Pollen counts are measured from low, meaning they affect few individuals, to high, meaning symptoms affect most allergy sufferers." source ilovetesla but, a phone counting "pollen" WTF is this tech man Sup Are you being serious right now? Red No, he's being serious next Thursday. Quint’s Sharking & Seashells Busy on Thursday, how about Friday? Cody Toombs Is this is a serious misunderstanding or are you trolling? The actual data collection happens at a facility that monitors pollen counts, and the results are then sent out for people to see on their phones. Derek Ross Pixel 2 will come with pollen sensors. You heard it here first. ilovetesla ohhhh ... OK .i thought there will be some kind of sensor in future android devices that measures pollen things dammit !!!! i'm bad Cody Toombs lol, it's cool. We all do it from time to time :) Quint’s Sharking & Seashells I know, its bad enough that a phone can tell you how much rain we get. I don't want my phone getting wet. This is nonsense and i'm talking out of my ass. Quint’s Sharking & Seashells Sorry, a little off topic, but do any of you have an issue where the weather icons do not show up in the Google Now widget? Peacen1k Been an issue over several versions, so for quite some time now. Also, only 2 rows of tiles show up, the rest of the widget space is empty. Kawshik Ahmed Maybe it will be something like this. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9abe1606e0efd2996cb434a33131a56a45a2a60b329ed1a4cec68331a778fafb.jpg 9+10=21 Nice jodieisme Thursday, July 28th..?🙈 Oasis Feng I guess the search bar in notification panel will be a normal notification with quick reply functionality as input field for quick search. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Time to start moving things to the bottom of the UI Google. #WebOs David Hyman I would be happy if it was implemented like how Textra handles the quick SMS notification. You hit the notification and the search widget appears as an overlay on top of everything else. They already have this overlay created too so it would be quick to implement in my opinion Ben Roberts I downloaded the apk but I don't see any search in the notifications Cody Toombs This is a teardown. Note the big disclaimer at the top and regular use of future tense as the feature is described. Captain_Invisible That means you have to read more than the title... Gonzales I see the search bar in the feed but not in the pull down notification, which is where I would like it. Rami I would like the search bar there, or back in overview. There's no way to easily open Google from Assistant without multiple taps, and my home screen setup has no room for a search bar.

The company said although the number of fake news stories being surfaced in search results is a very small proportion of the total news stories appearing at just 0.25%, the content is clearly misleading or just not correct, Google said. The first step it has taken is to update its Search Quality Rater Guidelines, which offers examples of low-quality webpages that Google's real-life 'raters' use as a resource to decide which websites should be downgraded in search. They have toughened the rules for flagging content which could be construed as providing "misleading information, unexpected offensive results, hoaxes and unsupported conspiracy theories". Google said this will be used to help its computer-powered algorithm to support the human raters, making autonomous decisions about what is fact and what is fiction. The search engine has also updated its ranking signals to surface more authoritative pages and demote the lower-quality pages. The fial piece to Google's fake news eradication programme is to make it easier for anyone to flag content as unexpected, inaccurate or offensive from both autocomplete predictions and featured snippets, which will also be used to update the company's search algorithm. "While this problem is different from issues in the past, our goal remains the same - to provide people with access to relevant information from the most reliable sources available," Ben Gomes, VP of engineering, said in a blog post. "And while we may not always get it right, we're making good progress in tackling the problem. But in order to have long-term and impactful changes, more structural changes in Search are needed.   This article originally appeared at itpro.co.uk Related Articles Google and Facebook reveal tools to battle fake news Billionaire eBay founder commits $100m to combat fake news Facebook trials automatic flagging for fake news Are 'bad bots' weaponising data centres to spread fake news?

(Tony Avelar / AP) By Ashlee Vance Bloomberg Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS Larry Page has his flying cars. Sergey Brin shall have an airship. Brin, Google co-founder, has secretly been building a massive airship inside of Hangar 2 at the NASA Ames Research Center, according to four people with knowledge of the project. It’s unclear whether the craft, which looks like a zeppelin, is a hobby or something Brin hopes to turn into a business. “Sorry, I don’t have anything to say about this topic right now,” Brin wrote in an email. The people familiar with the project said Brin has long been fascinated by airships. His interest in the crafts started when Brin would visit Ames, which is located next to Google parent Alphabet Inc.’s headquarters in Mountain View, California. In the 1930s, Ames was home to the USS Macon, a huge airship built by the U.S. Navy. About three years ago, Brin decided to build one of his own after ogling old photos of the Macon. In 2015, Google unit Planetary Ventures took over the large hangars at Ames from NASA and turned them into laboratories for the company. Brin’s airship, which isn’t an Alphabet project, is already taking shape inside one. Engineers have constructed a metal skeleton of the craft, and it fills up much of the enormous hangar. Alan Weston, the former director of programs at NASA Ames, is leading Brin’s airship project, according to the people, who asked not to be named discussing the secretive plans. Weston didn’t respond to requests for comment. Weston has a background befitting such an unusual enterprise. Born to Australian parents, he spent some of his youth in Turkey and then ended up at the University of Oxford. There he became a key member of the Dangerous Sports Club – a group of very intelligent risk-takers that formed in the early 1970s and did things such as catapult people across fields into nets. Members of the club are credited with inventing the modern form of bungee jumping. Years later, Weston joined the Air Force and did engineering work as part of the U.S. government’s Strategic Defense Initiative – known more broadly as the Star Wars missile defense system. In 1989, Weston oversaw one of the first tests of Star Wars, which aimed to destroy incoming Russian missiles midair with weapons fired from space. Following his stint at the Air Force, Weston joined NASA and worked on a wide number of projects, including the development of a low-cost lunar lander. In a radio interview in 2013, Weston described plans for an airship that could be used to haul cargo. The idea is that airships could be more fuel-efficient than planes and could carry loads directly to where they’re needed, rather than to transport centers like airports or shipping stations. “New airship technologies have the promise to reduce the cost of moving things per ton-mile by up to an order of magnitude,” Weston said in the interview. “It depends on the size of the airship. A larger airship can reduce costs a lot more than a smaller ship, but there’s design of a class of vehicles that can lift up to 500 tons that could be actually more fuel-efficient than even a truck.” Published: April 26, 2017, 4:59 p.m.  Click here to comment on this story » ​ Follow the Spokesman wherever you are: Facebook Twitter Newsletter Subscribe Print edition home delivery Newspaper Routes Available Help Customer Service Sitemap Directory Subscriber Services Classifieds Classifieds Advertising Obituaries More Masthead Staff Cowles Jobs Archives/Research Buy photo reprints Jumble Crossword Horoscopes Contact Us Downtown Spokane 999 W Riverside Ave Spokane, Wa 99201 Mailing Address P.O.

Opinion: Google should fix its erratic reminder system Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/26 2:15pm PDTApr 26, 2017 14 Plus 1 on G+ 52 Share on Facebook 46 Share on Twitter Total Shares112 Applications Editorials Google Article Contents 1 Input methods 2 Quick Access 3 Notifications 4 Allo and Home 5 Conclusion The ability to quickly set a reminder on your phone is one many of us take for granted these days. Smartphones have seemingly always had this basic PDA functionality. Type ‘add reminder’ into the Google search box and you’ll be able to quickly set up a notification to jog your memory about something later on. You can even use the ‘OK Google’ voice command: “remind me to pick up the groceries at 6pm,” for example. Easy-peasy. For most people, this function is used occasionally for something really important they simply mustn't forget. And for those people, it probably works just fine. However, for some people (like me) reminders have become an absolute necessity. I hate to admit it, but I have a really bad memory. Truly awful. For this reason, I am almost entirely dependent on Google’s system of reminders to navigate through each day. My phone will buzz with a reminder around 15 times per day. Some of these are one-offs. Some are recurring. All of them are to remind me to do something important, and without them, there’s no telling what I might forget to do. Don’t get me wrong, I am incredibly grateful that I am able to set reminders on my phone at all. But my extensive use of Google’s reminder system has also led me to conclude that it is inherently flawed. The biggest issue, as I see it, is a lack of consistency. Allow me to explain. Input methods There are currently no fewer than 6 distinct reminder input methods available to a typical Android user: Google app (including Google Assistant on compatible devices) Inbox Keep Calendar Chrome Allo Assistant With so many options, there’s always a convenient way to add a reminder to your Google account, whatever you happen to be doing when the need arises. Not all reminders are created equally, however. Add a reminder using any of the first 3 methods in the list and you’re offered the same basic options, such as when or where you’d like to be reminded and if you’d like the reminder to repeat. Inbox insists on using its ‘snooze’ terminology to denote reminder time, which isn’t ideal but we can handle that. Keep reminders are obviously linked to a specific note so you may not always want to use this option if you’d prefer your notes list to stay nice and tidy. They do still show up in your reminders list on the Google app, though, and can be dismissed from there accordingly. You cannot edit Keep reminders from within the Google app, however. To do that you’ll have hit the “Open in Google Keep” link and go through to the app itself. A Keep entry in the Google app's reminders list. If the experience already seems a little messy, it’s when you add a reminder to the Google Calendar app that things start to get weird. Firstly, these entries default to an ‘all day’ event, which seems a little counter-intuitive. It’s not difficult to change this to a timed reminder, but it's a slight annoyance that this option isn't the default. Secondly, unless you have the ‘Reminders’ box checked, which makes all of your reminders visible in your Calendar, none that you set here will actually deliver a notification. Having this option checked may not be a problem if you have one or two reminders set over the course of the week. But as I’ve already explained, I have many, many more than that. So when I set the Reminders calendar to be visible, in order to have the notifications working, my Calendar looks like this… My eyes!!! It even includes distinct entries for recurring reminders. So if you have a reminder set to recur every day it will show up in the month view for every single day, rather than just the next instance. The result is a mess. Needless to say that completely rules out Google Calendar as a method of input for me. Unfortunately, it took a couple of missed reminders when I didn’t have the option checked to figure out that the calendar functioned in this way. This was obviously frustrating, and I was lucky not to miss out on even more important notifications before I realized they weren't showing up. Another potentially handy way to set a reminder is by searching ‘add reminder’ on the Google homepage in your browser (on desktop or mobile). Regardless of browser or OS, if you’re logged into your Google account you should be able to easily set a reminder this way. Of course, there are a couple of limitations here too. First of all, there is no option to set a recurrence if you use this input method. You can revisit the entry in the Google app later on and set a recurrence there, but that kind of defeats the purpose of being able to add it in your browser in the first place. The second issue is that you can only set the reminder for predetermined times of the day. These include morning, afternoon, evening or night, as well as set times of on the hour (12:00) or half past the hour (12:30). This simply isn’t specific enough for certain tasks, and as a result, I tend to steer clear of adding reminders this way (except in an emergency), preferring the other more feature-rich methods. Quick Access At the moment there isn’t an especially fast way to enter a reminder input from your Android phone’s launcher. The ‘OK Google’ hotword (or Google Assistant on compatible devices) is easily the fastest method currently available, but there are still many of us who don't wish to talk loudly at our phones in public. Or even in private, for that matter. It's also worth mentioning that if you use the voice method this can often lead to misunderstandings or having to type extra information anyway. The Screen Search reminder button - simply not fast enough. The easiest solution would seemingly be to have a one-tap option to go straight into a reminder from your device homescreen. Instead, we have to long-press of the home button (on non-Assistant devices) which brings up Screen Search (previously Now on Tap) and click the pink Reminder button, or we can type ‘Add reminder’ into the search bar or Google app. Both of these routes often feel painfully slow. We do have app shortcuts for Calendar and Keep, which is great. But each app comes with its own feature limitations, discussed earlier, which preclude me from considering either as a viable option. If only the Google app has an "Add reminder" app shortcut or widget, the process would be a breeze. App shortcuts - why can't the Google app copy this approach? If you want to view and manage your reminders list there are several ways to do so. The Google app has a reminders list in the menu, and this is probably the most complete, robust way to manage them. Inbox displays them as pinned items in among your emails, or you can filter out everything else and view them in their own list, which functions similar to the list in the Google app. You can also snooze these in Inbox just as you can with emails. Keep has a section showing any notes that have reminders set against them, but doesn’t concern itself with any reminders not attached to one of its own notes. Lastly, Calendar (as you can see in the image further up) displays every single upcoming reminder alongside all of your other events, rendering it practically unusable. Notifications More examples of inconsistencies across these apps can be found in the notification shade. How each reminder is displayed and the quick actions associated with each vary widely. To dismiss this I must mark all 8 as ‘Finished’, including two I can't even see. When you have multiple Google app reminders they are bundled together in a single notification, rather than separated out into individual items. The only action you can perform is to mark all as ‘Finished’, dismissing every one of them at once. Another thing to remember is that notifications in Nougat only show up to 6 lines of content per app at any one time. So, in the example above there are two reminders I can’t even view without entering into the app. When you do enter into the app to mark individual items complete, that dismisses the notification from the shade entirely. If you were hoping to leave it there for the rest of the day as a glanceable to do list, you’re out of luck. Calendar reminder notifications similarly give you only the option to mark as done, but where they improve over the Google app is that you can tap into each individually and edit the reminder time on the next screen. This won’t affect the other notifications from the app. Inbox notifications are bundled rather more usefully, with each being individually expandable and giving the option to either mark as ‘Done’ or to ‘Snooze’. This offers you greater control over your tasks. While this is much closer to how it should be done, Keep refines this even further. Its notifications are also unbundled and come with two individual actions to choose from, snooze for an hour or snooze for even later. Swipe away the notification and you dismiss the reminder altogether, condemning it to the ‘Past’ section of the reminders list in the Google app. The exception being recurring reminders, which will still come back the next time they are set to recur. This is arguably the best way to handle reminder notifications, but you have to be happy to clog up your Keep list with reminders in order to utilize this. Keep's reminder notification - best in class. Your Google Now feed is yet another place you can interact with your reminder notifications. There, it’s possible to snooze reminders for an hour or mark as finished. But there seems to be little rhyme nor reason to how long reminder cards remain actionable in Google Now. It’s not uncommon for me to see a notification in Google Now long after I’ve dismissed it elsewhere, and vice versa. While the cards remain useful in some instances, this isn't a reliable way to manage your task list. Allo and Home Some of you may have noticed that I haven’t mentioned how the Google Assistant in Allo handles reminders. That’s because for some reason these reminders are kept completely separate from all those discussed above. They won’t appear in any of the other apps and can only be viewed in the Allo app when it notifies you. The notification is displayed as a message from the Assistant itself and it doesn’t appear as though you can snooze it at all, not even if you ask really nicely. Allo isn’t the only way to interact with the Google Assistant, of course, the other being Google Home. You might think that reminders would be a key function of the smart home device, but curiously you still can’t ask Home to remind you of something, months after its release. Even the addition of multi-user support hasn't yet brought with it the ability to add reminders. Much has been written about Home and Assistant still feeling like beta products. With omissions like this, it’s hard to disagree with that. Conclusion By experimenting with Google’s reminder system across all of these apps and interfaces, it’s probably possible to eventually find a way to make it work for you. I would argue that you shouldn’t have to work quite so hard to utilize what is in essence quite a basic service. I’ve tried countless other Android apps in a bid to satisfy my reminder needs, and effectively replace my defective memory. But nothing seems to hit the right balance of good design, usability, and features. Plus, there’s no substitute for being able to easily access my reminders from any device on which I can access my Google account, something Google’s reminder system still boasts over every other option on the Play Store. Still, there has to be a way to merge all of these separate interfaces and functions into a less frustrating experience. I'm sure this isn't a huge priority at Google, but I can dream, can't I? A discrete Google Reminders app would seem an obvious solution. One that plugs into the other Google services but ultimately acts as a standalone master-app might be the best way to alleviate some of these shortcomings and offer the experience I expect from a service like this. Then again, maybe it’s just me. Maybe I’m the only person who uses reminders to quite this extent and I should, in fact, seek help. Hopefully, that’s not the case. And hopefully someone at Google uses reminders just as much as I do, and with just as much frustration. Tags allo calendar google app google assistant google home inbox keep subscribe ...

Anything I set using voice is getting marked as done within 10 minutes of them notifying me. At first I thought I was crazy, I was seeing reminders in my Inbox that I had set while driving, but an hour later I'd say to myself "Wait didn't I set a reminder to do X?", only to find I HAD created the reminder, but it was marked as done. I can't figure it out! I opened a ticket with Google only to have some rep tell me I needed to clear my cache, but it still happens even when all my devices are off and browsers closed. Kevin Luther Yup. They have been really messed up. I keep finding them marked as done when j never even got the notice Simon Levin Yes that happens to me all the time. I've come to not rely on reminders for anything serious. catalysto I regularly encounter quirks like this with Google reminders. It's for this reason (and all the other stuff Scott said) that I only ever interact with them via Inbox. Fortunately, I enjoy using Inbox, so using that method is relatively painless for me, but for those who don't... Well hopefully the nightmare ends soon. A centralized reminder database/app seems to be the best solution. ShahinTr I just use events. I never bother using reminder, it's an absolute waste of time and space on calendar. Charles222 I've largely abandoned reminders in favor of calendar events and todoist. Todoist in particular, since it has equally-favored apps for the three OS's I use and Home support. David Ruddock Todoist seems very robust. I always consider trying it, then just don't because most of my reminding comes from calendar events, as you say. I want the solution to feel as integrated as possible. Scott Scrivens I have tried Todoist but I didn't like it. I don't actually remember why though...maybe I'll give it another shot. Waveblade Second on Todoist, just replacing it outright is better and the interface is way better than any other ones I've used. The other thing is context awareness is great. "Send email today at 4PM #" will figure out where it all goes. That is the killer feature about it wheelingdad If you need to set 15 reminders a day then you might look inward instead of trying to create/change a system that fits your issue. Just saying... Scott Scrivens pls halp Bruce Wayne Exactly. 15 reminders in a day is just absurd. I saw one of his screenshots and there was a reminder to "charge his phone". That says it all. Matt That calendar is what Leonard from Memento would have if they made that movie today. XerBlade Everything was just peachy for me using Inbox's reminder tools for all of this... until recently. For the last couple weeks, Google has made an incredibly asinine change where time-based notifications will automatically be marked as Done in just under an hour if you don't do it yourself. Which really mucks things up when you're, what's a simple example that's easy to convey... Say you set a reminder a while back that you forgot about (which is pretty much why you set a reminder in the first place), and it goes off while you're in a movie (and you didn't adjust it to go off later on after you're back from the movie beforehand because, you know, you don't have eidetic memory which is why you need reminders in the first place). Said reminder goes away on its own before the movie ends, so you never actually see it. That kind of BS has been happening to me DAILY since this started. [Notifications you just leave sitting in your inbox forever and never "Snooze" are fine though. Yay.] Kevin Luther I have been missing so many reminders lately as well. It's utter garbage destinyhud Here is what i do. I use google app to set all reminders. it will flow to calendar and keep is just for note taking. Now i set calendar events for more important thing to be reminder me a second time just to be be careful like my monthly mortgage Scott Scrivens This is essentially what I do currently. I wish it just worked from everywhere though. blahmoomoo Allo's subscriptions are kind of broken anyway, though I don't know if that also applies to recurring reminders. I told Allo to tell me the weather every morning, but if you don't chat with the bot on occasion, it stops doing that after about a week. Then I forget that it was supposed to remind me about the weather for a few days after each time that happened. So I have ultimately given up on it. EDIT: to be clear, the subscription is still there. It just forgets to keep sending it after a while if you don't talk to the bot, intentionally or not. 4Ui812 Google needs to fix more than just the reminder system. This is probably the least of their problems. Grey They should also bring Reminders to Gmail. Why is it Inbox-only? The other Inbox feature, Email Reminders, should be baked into the next version of Google. After that, what makes Inbox different? Jason Bell The biggest issue I've been having is that reminders don't always give me a real notification. It's always there in the Google App when I open it, but sometimes there's no notification. sam1331 I was just looking into this today. I've become increasingly dependent on reminders, and basically use it as my to do list these days. However, it definitely could be improved. The thing about the notifications is huge, if I have multiple pop up I have to click on the notification to dismiss one, and then the others are no longer sitting there in my notifications. Then I have to reschedule them to get them to sit there again, which is the whole point of the entire system. If they disappear from my notification shade, how will I remember to do them? I might as well not even use Google's reminder system at all then. It's just so convenient to type "remind me to..." in the search box and have it add whatever it is. MisterAlex I recently got a reminder notification for a "when I get home" reminder that I'd set over a year ago. No freakin' clue what made this particular arrival at home special enough to trigger it again... :v Jen Once they get all THIS stuff straightened out, I'd love the ability to set reminders by Time AND Location. For example, I'd love to say "Remind me to do laundry when I get home tonight" while I'm still at home in the morning... Right now, that would just "remind" me immediately since I'm still at home, or if I set it to a specific time, it might remind me before I get home in the evening or after I've been home a while. It'd also be useful for locations that have open/close times, like stores, where a location-only reminder won't be helpful if you frequently walk by at a time when it's closed. Having a Time + Location context would be immensely helpful! N8SLC This works for me. I use the assistant mostly. Scott Scrivens This. This would be so useful. PHLAK I also rely on reminders heavily. Hover, I limit myself to just using them through Inbox (both on the web and phone) to avoid all this complication. A stand-alone reminders app to "unify" reminder functionality would be awesome. Crossstick You & me Scott. I'm on a 12 person sales team plus a manager. NO ONE, but me uses automated reminders. I can't live without 'em. Ever since the original Palm Pilot ! Keep is my main workhorse for the past couple of years. Alex Renna This is the reason I switched to using a To-Do app (Todoist). There used to be a Gmail add-in (#todo) that stopped development after Google implemented Reminders on Calendar, and acted like you stated, only one occurrence that would move days until it was completed. If that made a come back I would be a happy man. kimbo I haven't had to make any reminders recently but I thankfully haven't experienced these issues before Cakefish I use Keep reminders a few times a month for important stuff like meetings and deadlines. Dozens of reminders a day? I wouldn't want to be that dependant on technology to function properly in everyday life. I can usually remember the mundane everyday stuff pretty well on my own, such as remembering to buy food and eat it, drink to keep myself hydrated, charge my phone when the battery gets low, go to the toilet, breathe in and out etc. Everyone's different though! Each to their own. Shakil Shaikh Jut install Tasks, the app formally known as Astrid: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.tasks Workflow wise, resizable/fiterable widgets do it for me (they also provide a quick way to enter a categorised task). Persistent notifications help in some cases too. Mostly though, it's the only to-do app that offers recurring tasks on both scheduled date (every 3rd Monday) or on completed date (3 weeks since last completed). It'd probably be quicker and healthier than waiting for Google to create some kind of compromised workflow for you instead. Scott Scrivens I was actually an avid Astrid user back in the day. Miss that little octopus. My issue with this as a solution is that I always need to use my phone. I'm looking for cross-device/platform integration. LaserWraith I tried to use Google's reminders in the past but gave up for reasons similar to yours. Todoist keeps me on track now across all my devices and it's pretty great. Some flaws still, but a big improvement. Raymond Berger Have you tried TickTick? I've been using it for years and it was been absolutely fantastic. It works across many platforms and has a relatively simple interface but also plenty of options for power users. Trip66 Been using it for years I love it...Bought it Immediately.+1 N8SLC You can de-select the reminders calendar. As for the rest, I think the sheer volume is on you. ;) Scott Scrivens You can, but then any reminder you set using Calendar won't work. Deeco PREACH AP!!! Please make more articles like these to highlight these simple anoying flaws. Let us be heard and get Google off​ their backside! ellett Why can't a reminder play a sound? As it stands now you can get an email or have a notification pop up, but everything is silent, which is useless if I'm doing something else when the reminder triggers. If I need an alarm, I have to set a reminder several hours in advance to remind me to set a phone alarm. Sophie Yes, many of these things have been bothering me, too! The state of Google's reminder system is much like their chat/messaging apps: confusing and fragmented (Ok, maybe it's not as bad as the chat/messaging apps). Like the author, I also rely on reminders (my calendar looks alot like his!). I primarily interact with them through the Google app, as well as a script I wrote for the Linux command-line that allows me to quickly add timed reminders (Google calls them quick events) to a special "My reminders" calendar (I wish I could save them to the default Reminders calendar that Calendar and the Google app seem to use, but it seems off-limits to developers). If Google's voice-to-text translation was better, I would stick to the Google app, I really don't mind talking at my phone, in public or otherwise, but it's not great. I have to correct things so often that I might as well type it in half the time (hence the command-line script). bdbplatano 🍻 Here's to hoping Google's paying attention🍻 Wolfie410 My biggest issue had to do with recurring reminders set through Google Now/Assistant. I was unable to clear a reminder ahead of schedule, without completely deleting the future occurrences of the recurring task. The only other option was to wait for the notification to pop and then dismiss it. Not very convenient. Have beem using the splendo to-do list. Rudresh Another way is to set an alarm with a note, works best for me. Lateef Alabi-Oki I wonder how hard it is to create a single reminder service, with a consistent API and behavior, that all their front-end services and third-party apps can use? Just thinking out loud here. Bruce Wayne I can't imagine why you would need a reminder to charge your phone. Trip66 Many of these shortcuts can be added to the homescreen in most launchers and especially in Nova but I use the OK Google method and several times a day. "Remind me in one hour that at 2pm so and so is coming by to.... That type of stuff... and I plan my whole day everyday so I don't forget someone is coming by or I have to be somewhere etc etc. It's a godsend to me and I can do it all hands free and 90% of the time it's in the car via BT. Awesome.ability. I fix computers all day so I'm always picking up or dropping off and also people drop and pickup to me so it reminds me when so I dont leave if someone is coming over or I have to be to their place at a specific time. But I haven't had any issues with them being marked as done or anything and they always go off at the time I say to. Viral Kacha https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5ee1efd75a870942aa10e7ecb1adcdfe05ac836338f4823d2d7a45180f970b2b.png "If only the Google app has an "Add reminder" app shortcut or widget, the process would be a breeze." Inbox app has the widget and it's quite neat and inclusive of all the features. Luzandro I also use the inbox widget, which works quite well for me, except when the shown presets for snoozing aren't appropriate (which is quite often the case for me, as the soonest suggestion is in the evening) it takes surprisingly many steps to choose something different TedPhillips yesss. the bundling gets me since if i finish one reminder but have a few overlapping (but not too many like you), need to be very aggressive but also careful about notification shade grooming. out of sight out of mind and all that. A+ Simon Levin Thank you. If only Google cared to fix their old products. Nathan J For me, reminders have always been crap on both platforms. On Android, I used an app called Lotify. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nll.lotify The nice thing about this app is that you have a ton of options, and a huge selection of icons to choose from, so if you have a lot, they stand out from one another. I expected iOS to be leaps and bounds ahead, because an iPhone just works, right? Not so fast. I found iOS lacking in that regard. Via Reddit, I found an app called "HiFutureSelf" that simulates a text message. You put in the message and the time you want to receive it. You can set a unique ringtone for the app. And when the time comes, you get your message. It suits my purposes. There might be better options, but I haven't seen any, personally. Ryan Warmack Business calendar pro hits the nail on the head for me. ilovetesla can anybody petition google to make adding birthdays and anniversaries to calendar easy Alicia Frederick Inbox has a widget you can add to the home screen on your phone for single tap quick access, which might help with the notifications since Inbox does them better. Jeremy Couch One thing that I hate is that when you dismiss Android notifications of reminders from Keep they mark it as Done. So I stopped using Keep for reminders. Very annoying. Ste Tan Excellent article. Reminders have been a pain for me as well throughout Google services. I've tried so many different apps—apps like todoist,etc— that just isn't as convenient for me compared to a native solution by Google. I eventually just went back to using Calender and keep for reminders and though it does become aggravating, I've grown to just deal with it since I need to use it daily. A Google reminders app would be perfect, especially since it would seemlessly sync and work consistently throughout all my Android devices plus any other device I have my Google account connected to. I really hope Google sees this article and takes it into consideration. Fabian Todt personally i like how google calender reminders show up, that's exactly how/why i use them: these are tasks/todos i have to do at this very moment so they are like an event/meeting. this is somehow similar to the getting things done method: i've got all tasks in todoist and plan them as reminders in calender when i have to do them. Neil S The article says that there is no widget for reminders that can be added to the home screen. I have one on my phone. The Google inbox app has a reminder set up widget which is quick to use. Just tape the reminder widget button and enter the reminder text, then hit the clock icon to set it for any time you like and to repeat if you like.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google improves Search to fight fake news proliferation By Rei Padla - April 26, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Search is no doubt the tech giant’s number one product. Google will not be Google if not for its search engine. It’s been almost two decades since the service was introduced on the web. The brand has since evolved into a bigger company, offering numerous web services, products, software, and hardware. Searching or should we say “googling” will always be an important activity in one’s digital life whether you admit it or not. Google has improved search in a lot of ways. The changes are not only aesthetic but also in function and as how people need the search engine results and pages to be. Google frequently changes algorithms to ensure that people are not directed to bad links or content farms. The company has somehow achieved the idea that netizens are presented with related and accurate information as much as possible. The past years, fake news proliferate all over the internet. We don’t know where exactly they are coming from but Google is stepping up to fight those low quality, misleading, and offensive articles that are being spread all over the web. To fight this issue, Google is doing some structural changes in Search in order for them to still provide relevant information all the time. Google is releasing algorithmic updates to boost more authoritative content. Evaluation methods have been improved while new Search Quality Rater Guidelines are made available. The goal is to demote low-quality content. Some ranking changes have been made as well to surface more authoritative pages. Google is also now using direct feedback tools. Flagging content that are not useful is made easier with direct feedback tools. You can now inform Google if a search result is unhelpful or sensitive. Google also wants to offer more transparency this time that is why the company just published policies on Autocomplete on the Help Center.

This led to speculation that we could soon see Google launch their own pair of headphones, although admittedly these aren’t exactly the most stylish of headphones we’ve seen. However it turns out maybe it’s not worth getting excited over. According to the folks at Android Police, they have learnt from a source that the headphones are actually for employees only. It turns out that Google has been distributing Google-branded headphones to its employees for a while now, and that the model you see above is the current one that Google is using. However it seems that the current model is getting a bit long in the tooth which is why Google decided to update it. The new ANC Bluetooth version spotted at the FCC is just a new design that they are planning to introduce and to phase out the current model, and since they are employees-only, don’t expect to see them sold outside of Google anytime soon. We did hear rumors about Google planning some kind of audio-based wearable, but if those rumors are true it definitely isn’t talking about this. Filed in Audio >Gadgets.

Sarmistha Acharya International Business Times 26 April 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share Sergey Brin building airship at NASA Ames Research CenterMore Google co-founder Sergey Brin is said to be secretly building an airship inside Hangar 2 at the Nasa Ames Research Center. People familiar with the project told Bloomberg that Brin has been fascinated by airships. He decided to build one about three years ago after he saw photos of USS Macon, an airship built by the US navy. Trending: Google Home review: Can Google's smart speaker topple Amazon Echo and Alexa? The metal skeleton of the craft has apparently been constructed but it is not clear if the project is just a hobby or if Brin wants to turn it into a business. In an emailed statement, Brin told Bloomberg, "Sorry, I don't have anything to say about this topic right now." Don't miss: Steve Wozniak: Apple, Google and Facebook will still be around and 'bigger' in 2075 The airship project is reportedly led by Alan Weston, the former director of programmes at Nasa Ames. He has worked in the US Air Force where he did engineering work for the Star Wars missile defense system. In 1989, he oversaw one of the first tests of Star Wars, which was aimed at destroying Russian missiles midair. He then joined Nasa and worked on several projects. In a 2013 radio interview, Weston talked about his plans to make airships more fuel efficient than planes. Most popular: Unmanned Chinese cargo ship Tianzhou-1 docks with Tiangong-2 space lab "New airship technologies have the promise to reduce the cost of moving things per ton-mile by up to an order of magnitude. It depends on the size of the airship. A larger airship can reduce costs a lot more than a smaller ship, but there's design of a class of vehicles that can lift up to 500 tons that could be actually more fuel-efficient than even a truck," Weston explained in the interview. "And so the way that works is that the helium in the main envelope is taken and stored in bags inside the airship at a slightly higher pressure. As you do that, air is taken in from the outside into essentially like lungs that are attached in the side of the vehicle. So the analogy of breathing is a good one. And the overall lift of the vehicle is equal to the weight of the air that is being displaced by the helium. And as you change that, you can control the amount of buoyancy that the vehicle has," said Weston. With the technique, the airship could carry 500 tons without requiring for a ballast.

A new Google Maps feature has you covered. Google officially rolled out the new feature on Tuesday, which it reportedly beta-tested for Android users last month. Tap the blue dot showing your location to see an option to save your parking place on the map. A label will pop up showing where you parked your car. By tapping on that label, you can open up a “parking card” to add additional details about the parking spot — such as which level of the parking garage you’re in, or the amount of time left before the meter expires. Users can save an image of the spot and send their parking location to friends. Last November, Apple launched a similar but automatic parking-detection tool for Apple Maps. If iOS users connect their iPhones to their cars using Bluetooth, their parking spots will be automatically added to the map with a pin when they disconnect and get out of their car. Google offers a similar feature for iOS owners using Google Maps. Trademark and Copyright 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved.

CLOSE Politics Religion Sports Voting Laws Culture Health Immigration Technology Economy Education Energy Thursday, April 27, 2017 Insider K Street Lifestyle Opinion Politics Religion Sports Voting Laws Culture Health Immigration Technology Economy Education Energy Home Technology Are Minorities Being Left Behind in the Google+ Migration? Policy Technology Are Minorities Being Left Behind in the Google+ Migration? By Jeneba Ghatt - 2:30pm July 18, 2011 18602 85 SHARE Facebook Twitter For all the talk about US Blacks and Hispanics being the most active users of Twitter and having a substantial membership on Facebook, it seems they may not be quickly migrating to and taking advantage of Google’s latest attempt at breaking into the social media sphere, the Google + project. It is still quite early in the Google+ roll out, but according to a recent analysis, membership on that site has grown 350% since it launched to members of the tech community on an invite-only basis on June 28.   Today, there are reports that over 10 million people have already joined Google +.   But scan the profile images of some of the 940,000 users  listed on the website Find People on Plus and you may notice the dearth of brown and black faces among users.  And even among those who managed to get an early invite, they are like many of the later adopters who do not necessarily “get” the new platform yet and have simply set up a basic profile and have not used it since.  Much of the buzz of the site had to do with the fact that so few people were allowed on in its earliest Beta testing stages. The curious all wanted a golden ticket. The site is used most actively now by the crowd of adventurous tech aficionados who are anxious to see Google finally get the social media thing right.  Google’s previous experiments with Buzz, Orkut, and Wave all failed to take off.   Google+ is slowly creating a new category of user addicts because it is cleaner, so far Ad-Free, and is touted as not being riddled with the same privacy concerns as Facebook, neither is it saddled with applications that litter users streams with gaming updates, for example.    Many Google+ users spend their time sharing ideas and tips on how to navigate the site.  They also lament how much better it is than Facebook in that it allows them more control over with whom they share information and interact, and how much easier it is to filter out those who they want to limit access to certain updates or photos. Who is on Google+ now? It still may be too soon to be taking a critical look at users of a 3-week old site, but since it launched, several articles have examined every aspect of the site including the fact that at one point, only 10% of its users were female.  Because more and more studies reveal that Hispanics and Blacks have higher than average mobile phone ownership and are accessing broadband through their mobile devices, it is not too presumptuous to think those groups would have been early adopters of Google+.  The “digital elite” , the interconnected web of popular bloggers, technical experts and early adopters to the newest technologies,  made up the earliest invitees.  This elite group is quite monolithic and for the most part includes middle to upper middle class professional whites and Asians.   In America anyway, most socialize in racially segregated circles so when Google allowed those on the site to invite their friends, it should come as no surprise then why the second wave of users mirrored the racial make up of the first wave.  Members of the black Technoratti who work with and associate with the general population of tech experts have a  healthy representation on Google+ now as well.  Perhaps, as they began to invite their circle of friends, they helped diversify the site. But beyond these audacious early users,  many are still skeptical about adopting yet another social media platform, and especially one that is not necessarily intuitive.   Google + requires people to categorize their network of family, friends, and colleagues into neat circles and enables users to participate in simultaneous video chat and explore articles categorized by interest. Google+ is not that intuitive as the tech savvy application development community may think.  It certainly is  not as turnkey as Facebook.  With Facebook, anyone can  pretty easily figure out the lay of the land within moments of signing up.  Not so much with Google +.   In response to some user confusion, there have been over two dozen articles published by leading tech publications and sites explaining how to navigate the site.  A killer competitor to Facebook  shouldn’t be so difficult to circumnavigate. And even then, many have already invested lots of  time cultivating a home on Facebook, building photo albums and “friending” long lost classmates and relatives.  It will take a lot to get many reluctant and less active  folks to adopt Google +.  So the question remains whether it will survive the initial rounds of early users, folks who are eager for its success and will more quickly appreciate its benefits. But then again, not all people “got” Twitter initially either.  Minorities slowly gravitated to it as well and have since taken over,  some reports say.   An Edison Research annual report on Twitter  showed that Blacks represented 25% of Twitter users, roughly twice their share of the population in general.  A Pew Research Center’s Internet & American Life Project report showed slightly lower usage statistics, but still impressive, indicating usage among blacks and Hispanics proportionate to their population at 13% and 18%, respectively. Google+  shares user demographics based on region of the country, profession, and gender but not race.   When Google opens the site to all users, we may likely see more minorities migrate over but not as quickly as one would think or some would want. Social media expert Lindsay Holmes, owner of LCH Business, a branding & marketing company, says while Google+ may be a competitor to Facebook, she doesn’t think Google+ will be Twitter killer. “People who get Twitter and use it for marketing won’t abandon it that fast because they know its utility and Google+ can’t compete,” Holmes said. ” If there is anything that will slow minorities down from adopting any new technology that would be  intimidation and once they get over that initial hurdle, they will get on.” Holmes said when people are able to realize the usability of Google+, they will join more when it becomes available to more.  “We are people that need usability and understand usability,” she added. It is quite possible then that Hispanics and Blacks, as a group, may be among the last to join the site if it indeed lasts through the long haul and becomes a viable competitor to Facebook.  They may be less likely than other groups to join the bandwagon and try a new platform.  They may remain loyal users of Twitter and Facebook as Asian and Whites, and tech savvy higher income minorities join Google+. Google+, the place to go to escape the  “ghettoization” of other social media platforms In essence, if  Google+ indeed is able to court away some of Facebook’s 750 Million users and black and brown users adopt later, we may be looking at a repeat of what happened with MySpace.  According Researcher Danah Boyd, scores of more affluent and white users abandoned MySpace for Facebook partly because there was an impression that it had become too “ghetto” and used by blacks and Hispanics.     She discussed this issue back in 2007 in a controversial chapter of a forthcoming book addressing “digital” white flight, the Digital Race Anthology. In White Flight in Networked Publics?  How Race and Class Shaped American Teen Engagement with MySpace and  Facebook, the Microsoft Research and Harvard Berkman Center for Internet and Society scholar conducted ethnographic research and used anecdotal conversations with over 100 youth to conclude there was a “white flight” from MySpace because it had become too brown. Currently, Blacks and Hispanics still have a predominant presence on MySpace and are represented on that site at a disproportionate rate at 26% and 45%, respectively, when they are 12% and 16% in the population as a whole.  Some have speculated, though not gone on record saying, that Rupert Murdoch sold off MySpace, which was once valued at $12 billion for a mere $35 million because he saw no value in a tool being used primarily by minorities and poor whites.  Some critics of Murdoch say MySpace went down hill after Murdoch’s Newscorp acquired the once popular site, first used by nascent bands and performing groups to promote their albums and songs.  He failed to sufficiently invest in it to make it competitive to new sites – Facebook launched one year after MySpace- and then quickly abandoned it when its cream users stopped using it.  A more plausible explanation may be that NewsCorp simply wanted to free up some cash to acquire a majority stake in UK’s Sky Broadcasting, that MySpace was too prone to viruses, hackers and spam than Facebook or because Facebook was simply more attractive options for users.  But those who stayed, did so by choice.  As one blogger on the Project Economic Refugee pointed out, what Latinos loved about MySpace was the freedom to be creative, everything Facebook isn’t and why they did not join it when everyone else was. Facebook  is used widely by all races these days as is Twitter. But as mentioned,  recent reports indicate higher than average Twitter use among Blacks and Hispanics and data indicate this may because they are more likely using their mobile devices to access social media than whites. According to a new report by the Pew Research Center’s Internet & American LIfe Project, 44% of African Americans and Hispanics say they own a smartphone, compared to just 30% of non-Hispanic whites. Using this type of data as a guide, several bloggers and tech watchers have pondered whether Black and Hispanics use of mobile devices will enable them to leapfrog over other groups and help them bridge the digital divide. While idealistic and hopeful, that outcome would hardly be realized so long as Blacks and Hispanics are slow to navigate to new services. Are minorities positioned to be left behind? Since Google+ was rolled out, a benefit of being an early adopter is being able to access and be visible to some of the top players in the digital, programming and application world.  Those who are followed by millions on Twitter, are only being “followed” by hundreds or thousands on Google+.  When followers pose a query as a follow up to a post by a more popular user, they are more likely to get a direct answer.  There is interaction. Right now is the peak and prime time to get on, start exploring, learn from and exchange with leaders in your field you may not ordinarily have easy access to on other platforms.  Once the site is opened to millions that accessibility will dissipate most likely. Many of the current inhabitants are dreading the inevitable.  When news broke this week that Google plans to soon open up the social media tool to everyone, some Google+ users let out a collective sigh. “There goes the neighborhood,” one person commented on the stream of noted Tech writer Mike Elgan. Another added, “As soon as Google+ is open, the quality will drop.” These retorts show that Google+ perhaps , for a few, is a place to escape the not so pleasant aspects of Twitter, including users who in the past have been said to be degrading the medium by using it to create and discuss crass, misogynistic, racist and even violent trending topics.  While some users may want to be exclusionary, Google can’t afford to shun anyone if it truly plans to put a dent into Facebook’s 750 Million user database. It will have to be inclusive of broad demographics, encourage them to navigate over and make it useful and easy for them to stay and set up shop in a similar fashion as the earliest adopters. When the site is eventually opened who is to say even whether minority groups and younger users will wander over and join immediately?  It may not matter. Google+ may bolt out the starting gate, gain momentum and slowly die out just like other social media sites that have tried to rival and best Facebook.   Only time will tell.

At Amazon, he led development of Kindle tablets, the Echo voice-activated speaker and other devices.  He was a marquee hire for Alphabet Inc.’s Google, made just as the internet search giant unfurled the first wave of its own branded devices. Foster didn’t immediately respond to a LinkedIn message seeking comment. At Google, Foster stepped into a new role, vice president of hardware product development, working on the company’s Pixel smartphone and Home speaker, an Echo competitor. His sudden exit marks a setback for Google’s gadget ambitions — the company is planning to release at least two new Pixel smartphone models this fall, according to a person familiar with the company’s plans, who asked not to be identified discussing private matters. The hardware division also competes with Apple Inc., Amazon and other companies building devices tied to intelligent software, like digital assistants, that could upend existing models for media and advertising—markets that Google now leads. A Jefferies LLC report this week said hardware “should be a meaningful revenue driver” for Alphabet. The company, which reports first-quarter earnings today, doesn’t break out device sales. Foster had reported to Rick Osterloh, the former Motorola executive Google hired last year. Google isn’t planning to replace Foster, a person familiar with the company’s plans said.  Before Amazon, Foster worked at hardware groups at Microsoft Corp and Apple.  Earlier this week, German publication WinFuture reported that it uncovered evidence of three planned Google devices in Android code information online. — Bloomberg                 MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Saudis, oil majors discuss gas investments ahead of giant IPO Ringgit opens at 4.3490/3550 against US greenback Ivanka Trump to discuss fund for women with World Bank Trump’s taxes slash seen as ‘guidepost’ by Republicans (VIDEO) Bursa shares open marginally lower, but later turned higher Saudis, oil majors discuss gas investments ahead of giant IPO Petronas Dagangan registers record profit in 34 years Why are global players chasing Proton?

[Painting: “Napoleon Crossing the Alps” by Jacques-Louis David] By DJ Pangburn04.25.17 | 2:00 pm In early January, the artist and technologist Daniel Howe opened an email from Google informing him that his three-year-old ad-blocking app, AdNauseam, had just been banned from the company’s Chrome Web store. Overnight, he discovered, the free app’s 60,000 users had lost access to the app on Google’s popular browser, and all comments, ratings, reviews, and statistics had vanished. advertisement Ads are the economic powerhouse of the internet, supporting much of its “free” content and services, this website included. But they are also easy to hate, making the internet distracting, ugly, slow, and more costly to use. This partly helps explain the demand for ad blockers: Installations grew by 30% last year to 615 million computer or mobile devices, or 11% of the world’s online population, according to estimates by Page Fair, an industry group. Google and its parent company, Alphabet, which dominates the market for online ads and made an estimated $79 billion from them in 2016, has taken a largely hands-off approach to the potentially existential threat of ad blockers. And, according to recent reports, it now plans to include “ad-filtering” software pre-installed in Chrome—an “if you can’t beat ’em, join ’em” approach to making the web less annoying. But AdNauseum isn’t like the other ad blockers: It takes a more activist approach. Rather than just concealing them, the app sends noise into the system by automatically clicking on ads in the background, muddling efforts by advertisers and ad networks like Google’s to determine your preferences and your identity as you browse the web. Alan Toner, a policy consultant at the Electronic Frontier Foundation who studies ad blocking, calls AdNauseum affectionately, “a piece of agitprop theater” designed to “creatively protest the surveillance mechanism behind advertising.” “No Clarity At All” Google, however, didn’t complain about AdNauseum’s approach to protesting ads. Instead, it pointed to a developer agreement that gives the company “the right to suspend or bar any Product from the Web Store at its sole discretion,” and offered a more prosaic reason for the ban: An extension should have a single purpose that is clear to users. Do not create an extension that requires users to accept bundles of unrelated functionality, such as an email notifier and a news headline aggregator. Baffled, Howe wrote back to ask Google how this rule applied to AdNauseum. In a second email, a company representative explained that an extension should not perform both blocking and hiding ads. In an email, a Google spokesperson confirmed to me that the company’s single-purpose policy was the reason for the app’s removal, not because it automatically clicked on ads, but wouldn’t comment further. To Howe and his cofounders, designer and activist Mushon Zer-Aviv and NYU information science professor Helen Nissenbaum, this explanation is hard to accept at face value. Many ad blockers, including uBlock, Adblock Plus, Adblock, and Adguard, both hide and block ads, trackers, and malware, and yet all of these are allowed in the Chrome Web store; AdNauseum had been in the store for two years. Instead, the team suspected a simpler motive behind Google’s decision: AdNauseum directly conflicts with the way that the company makes most of its money. advertisement Murshon Zer-Aviv [Photo: Erhardt Graeff/MIT]“Why would [Google] allow almost any other ad blocker to also block malware and only block us for doing so?” said Zer-Aviv. Alok Bhardwaj, the founder of the Epic browser, which has had its own privacy-related clash with Google, said Google’s explanation reflected “strained logic.” But he also said that AdNauseum’s click-all-the-ads approach raised the threat of ad blockers by an order of magnitude. “If there’s considerable doubt over whether an ad click is legitimate or not, that’s a big problem for Google charging for ad clicks,” he wrote in an email. “It could undermine Google’s business model more severely than plain ad blockers, so it’s probably their thought to ‘nip it in the bud.'” “The official reasons offered for their exclusion have been so generic as to provide no clarity at all,” Toner said. “Its exclusion needs an explanation.” Ads Aren’t Just Ugly: They’re Invasive Google’s decision to ban AdNauseum was only the latest salvo in an ongoing war over online advertising. The industry and publishers have recently been fighting back against ad blockers, for instance, by requiring visitors to disable them if they want to view a page. In August, Facebook announced it was blocking anti-ad software across its platform. And while AdNauseum is the first desktop ad blocker Google has blocked, it has previously banned mobile apps like anti-tracking tool Disconnect and ad blocker AdBlock Fast from its Android Play Store, citing a rule that says one app can’t interfere with another. The ad industry also knows that ads can be a nuisance, and it’s taking pre-emptive measures to make them more palatable—or, in Google’s case, to block the unpalatable ones. “We feel like there are a lot of challenges in advertising. There are a lot of wrong ways,” Darin Fisher, vice president of Chrome engineering, told CNet last year. But “if publishers and advertisers do ads the right way, it can be great for the users and for the ecosystem.” But Google’s positions also point to a crucial disagreement at the heart of the ad war: What makes ads such a nuisance to begin with? advertisement Advocates insist that ads aren’t just ugly, annoying, and bandwidth-sucking: They pose a risk to privacy, as the networks of software behind ads—cookies, trackers, and malware—watch not only where you go on the web but, through your phone and your purchases, what you do in real life. This data, which helps data brokers better understand you, includes everything from your health to your shopping and financial habits to your political and religious views. But privacy is largely missing from Google’s discussion of problematic ads, says Howe. By avoiding mentioning AdNauseum’s actual intent, Google’s explanation for banning it echoes the advertising industry’s discussion of web ads, which focuses on aesthetics rather than privacy. “Google does not want the ad-blocking debate to be about surveillance and civil liberties because it has very weak arguments to make there,” he wrote in a post on the blog of Princeton’s Center for Information Technology Policy. Instead, “it would like to keep the debate to the economics and aesthetics of ads…” Mobile ad blocker use—much of it in Asia—now outpaces use on desktop browsers. [Chart: PageFair]With a built-in ad filter for Chrome, which commands an estimated 60% of the browser market, Google could continue to frame the debate in terms of aesthetics rather than in terms of privacy. Google’s ad filter would be based on standards drawn up last month by The Coalition For Better Ads, a global coalition of advertisers cofounded by Google and including industry groups, publishers like Facebook and The Washington Post, and advertisers like Proctor & Gamble and Unilever. (Apple, which permits third-party blockers on its Safari browser, and Mozilla, which includes anti-ad features in its Firefox browser, are not part of the Coalition.) The new guidelines urge the rest of the industry to stop using the kind of annoying ad formats that have fueled the rapid rise of ad blockers, like pop-ups, auto-play video ads, and full-screen ads. But the standards do not mention tracking or user privacy. “By banning AdNauseam and then rolling out its own ad blocker, Google is now trying to prevent anyone else from drawing the line in the sand when it comes to which ads are presented to the user,” Zer-Aviv said. Google would be “leveraging its near monopoly in the ad and browser markets to forcefully exclude any competition that does not align with its model of ‘acceptable ads,’ be it other ad networks, the Do Not Track standard, or privacy initiatives like our own.” Google’s advertising business depends upon tracking more than ever. A little-noticed change to the company’s privacy policy last year gave it the ability to track users’ web activity across a majority of sites and apps. (In a concession to privacy, the company also now allows users to change their default settings to “opt-out of ad personalization.”) advertisement Google’s ad blocker could give the company more leverage over advertisers and other ad blockers that have recently launched so-called “Acceptable Ads” programs, which permit some ads to be shown that are deemed to be “non-intrusive.” Google and other major ad networks already pay to participate in AdBlock Plus’s acceptable ads program, which provides the bulk of revenues for Eyeo GmbH, the company that makes the app. A Google ad filter could also effectively suppress a new Do Not Track standard. The older standard is essentially an automated request from your browser, asking the websites you visit to refrain from tracking you. The new version of DNT, developed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, is dynamic: It asks websites not to track you and it knows if they comply. In its most recent update, AdNauseum permitted sites that complied with the Do Not Track policy to display ads to users, and refrained from clicking on those ads. (Because Google does not comply with DNT, the app blocked Google resources such as Doubleclick.net and Google Analytics.) Howe thinks the new DNT feature may have contributed to Google’s decision to boot AdNauseum from the web store. The standard may be threatening to Google, Howe wrote in his blog post, “perhaps because it could represent a real means for users, advertisers, and content providers to move away from surveillance-based advertising.” If enough sites adopt Do Not Track, “there will be significant financial incentive for advertisers to place ads on those sites, and these too will be bound by DNT, as the mechanism also applies to a site’s third-party partners. And this could possibly set off a chain reaction of adoption that would leave Google, which has committed to surveillance as its core business model, out in the cold.” Toner, of the EFF, said “it does seem like a strange coincidence” that AdNauseum was banned soon after it integrated support for the new DNT standard. Privacy Badger, the EFF’s own Chrome app that blocks cross-site trackers, also supports the new DNT standard, but it has not encountered problems with Google, he said. Cable companies are also seeking a piece of the marketing pie on which Google, Facebook, and other digital media giants are already feasting. The bill President Trump signed last month to repeal privacy rules for internet service providers will allow those companies to collect and sell customers’ browsing data to third parties without their express consent. advertisement The playing field is growing ever more sophisticated too, as companies combine web data mining with personality behaviors gleaned via Facebook to better profile consumers and target them with ever more persuasive ads, be it for pop stars or politicians. “We think that ISPs should not be helping track their users,” said Cooper Quintin, a security researcher and programmer at EFF. Nor do most Americans, according to a survey by YouGov and the Huffington Post. Seventy-one percent of the public—and 72% of Republicans—believe the FCC’s privacy rules should have gone into effect (see the interactive chart below). Some states, meanwhile, including Minnesota and Washington, are contemplating new privacy rules to pick up the slack. Users who want privacy from ad tracking can use a variety of free and subscription-based software to defend themselves. Toner suggests installing tracker blockers like Privacy Badger, Disconnect and uBlock, beefing up ad-blocker software with the Easyprivacy filter, and turning off Acceptable Ads in AdBlock Plus or AdBlock for Chrome. Browsers like Firefox, Epic, or Brave also include ad blocking and anti-tracking features. Meanwhile, new technologies for ad blocking, including a prototype “perceptual” ad blocker developed by researchers at Princeton and Stanford, promise even more effective ad blocking in the future. And despite Google’s ban, AdNauseum still works in Firefox and Opera, while enterprising Chrome users can manually install the app in developer mode. New Privacy Laws Legal changes are also on the horizon. A new set of rules in the European Union called the General Data Protection Regulation, scheduled to go into effect in May, will require all companies serving the region’s more than 500 million residents to receive explicit consent from those users for ad targeting or risk paying prohibitive fines—as much as 4% of their global revenues. The impact of the EU rules on ad targeting could be global, and could dovetail with efforts by some advertisers to improve the way they distribute ads. Currently, the complex ecosystem of online ads is rife with click fraud and distribution schemes that make it hard for advertisers to know if ads are actually being viewed and what kind of content their ads are appearing next to. Building more transparency and simplicity into the system could benefit not only readers but advertisers and publishers too. advertisement Even after the new EU laws, privacy proponents are likely to continue trying to build better blockers, and companies like Google will keep trying to make that work difficult—or build their own. Google will likely maintain the upper hand. To Zer-Aviv, the company’s banning of AdNauseum was less about compliance with rules (the policy that Chrome apps should not have “multiple functionality”) than about a show of force. He interpreted Google’s “multiple functionality” argument as trying to “force us to compromise our software’s security”—by requiring the app to remove its malware-blocking features—”so we can be easily discredited.” But in recent weeks, the team decided to change course: It amended AdNauseum so that it would not block malware, in order to meet what they thought was compliance with Google’s policy. Again, the app was rejected. In another email, Google cited the app’s “multiple functionality” as a problem, Zer-Aviv said. “I think this pretty much seals the question about Google’s sincerity on the reasons for the ban against AdNauseam.” As he and his cofounders argue, real progress in online privacy isn’t about the option to see less annoying ads: It would require corporate policy and government regulations to align to give users an option to fully opt out of online tracking if they want to. Until that happens, anything less isn’t much of an option at all. With additional reporting by Alex Pasternack.

Google issues headphones to a large number of its employees, and the current model is getting quite Well this is... unexpected. We've heard whispers of a new Google Home/Google WiFi combo, and even the next Pixel devices, but nothing in the realm of audio products. Out of nowhere, a set of headphones from Google have appeared in a new FCC filing. The headphones, which are identified as 'GID5B,' are definitely a bit odd. One side has a power button, and the other a simple Google logo, both in a circle matching Google's logo colors. According to the documents, these headphones support Bluetooth connectivity - but there doesn't appear to be any mention of a microphone. As with many wireless headphones, there is an AUX connector if you don't want to mess with Bluetooth. Strangely, there is a microUSB port for charging - not USB Type-C. According to the user manual included in the FCC filing, GID5B has a 600mAh battery. It's very possible that this was filed to get clearance on the internal radio, which could later be included on a different pair of headphones. The microUSB port, lack of microphone functionality, and no Google Assistant features seems to back up this claim. It would be a bit strange for Google to release headphones without any unique functionality, using an old port. Update 1: 2017/04/26 10:30am PDT An anonymous tipster has shed some light on what these almost certainly are. Google issues headphones to a large number of its employees, and the current model is getting quite long in the tooth. We've got a picture of it below. As you can see, it bears the same power button iconography as the ones in the FCC filing above. These headphones are distributed for use only inside Google and are not sold anywhere - they're just for Googlers. This new ANC Bluetooth version is just an update on the design, probably meant to replace these older headsets as they're phased out. So, no: Google is not releasing a really ugly wireless headphone with a microUSB port and no microphone. Well, not to anyone except Googlers.

I knew they had a merch store but I certainly didn't think there was electronics there that weren't on the store.google.com They must not make or design the merch ones and it's just a logo slapped on. MJ They don't... It's a fake store. Shagnscooby It's not fake. I've done telephone survey's for Google and one of the payment options was a Google Merch store gift card instead of other gift cards. MJ Google does telephone surveys? Who even answers telephone surveys or picks up on unrecognized numbers? mog386 Wrong. It's legit. Lol. You dolt. "About Robertson Marketing Robertson is Google’s branded merchandise partner in North America.

MJ Really? You had go with the name calling? I don't care what the fucking website says... It doesn't look legit at all. Even if they have the rights to slap the Google logo on shit they aren't Google's products. The OP was wrong about the headphones. Aaron Berlin I'm guessing those are just white label goods with Google branding on them, so GOOG wouldn't actually file with the FCC. Maybe??? MJ It's not official merchandise! It's fake! mog386 Wrong. It's legit. Lol. "About Robertson Marketing Robertson is Google’s branded merchandise partner in North America.

David Ruddock I'm sorry, but not even close. MJ LOL I beat you to it David. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I mean they are both headphones... Dan Proctor Mentioned it above but my comment was aimed at these going into their merchandise store vs a real consumer product. My company offers the same generic branded things that go through the FCC as our own products. Very common among the bigger companies of the world. David Ruddock They could, but seeing as we've never seen any headphones go through under Google's name before, I have my doubts. Dan Proctor As in these look like they will be going into this store. Same as other people have said about them being the generic items Google offers at events and to employees. David Mendívil if this thing has an internal FM radio receiver (analog), I will get one Sashank Narayan What mainstream headphones even have that capability? Justin W I can answer this: none. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And why? FM radio still exists? David Mendívil dude, not everyone lives in EEUU or EUROPE, most of the human population still hears analogical radio stations Matt It's not just a Europe thing. I live in the US and I have not listened to FM radio in years. Erstam Same. I despise analog radio. Do many commercials plus it usually sounds like crap. DanSan I don't even know where the FM radio button is in my car. /s yes i do but you get the point. David Mendívil Sorry EEUU is USA in Spanish hehe but at least in south america, it is quite common to still have the good old FM radio stations, having a data plan is still too expensive Matt Oh, right. I even know that. I think having it right next to EUROPE my brain just combined it all. podme Probably giveaways to employees and swag for events, etc Jarrett Lennon Kaufman They'd be better off rebranding OEM headphones for just that, though, and could skip this process. Mordalo I'm more concerned about the sound quality. If they sound good and don't break my bank account (or my mortgage payment), I'd be happy to get another set of good Bluetooth cans. They don't need to be always on or listening (even though this is Google). mlm5em Sees Headline: Must buy immediately Sees Mirco USB: Run away T4rd What wireless headphones (or any phone/PC accessories) have USB-C ports yet? Erstam My phone is usb c. My Chromebook only had usb c. I have a mouse and keyboard that are usb c. My battery pack is usb c. Come to the future brother. It's great!. I use the same cable to charge everything normally too. I actually had the same thought as the guy above. I'm not buying anything that's not usb c any more. It's not future proof and i rarely have to carry a non c cable anymore (except on a trip i bring an extra micro usb for my gf s7). T4rd So your mouse and keyboard.. that's pretty much it. I agree, I would only like to buy USB C accessories as well, but it seems they're not picking it up any time soon still. catalysto So you're being purposefully obtuse. T4rd Likewise. catalysto That's a yes. T4rd For you. DanSan https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5e55bc06067cf74753d28062e8aaf21244bf97f17ad555a1d4b58976f73be2bf.gif catalysto Interesting angle you took there.

Could be cool. marcusmarcus2 That is the first thing I thought when I read the headline makapav That would be a pretty good idea - as long as it also has a mic for calls and gives the option for filtering in ambient sound/noise when needed. Rinkesh621 How about cast and miniature Google home, so you can order pizza, while you stream your music from your Spotify while you watch e-sport games with Picture in Picture of watching old Charlie Chaplin silent film? No.... just a though. lol SpeakethTheTruth Sounds like a Pimp My Ride episode. Lateef Alabi-Oki 600mAh battery for a headphone? What are they aiming for? A week long battery life. Jay I'd probably buy them because Google. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ 4Ui812 They'll probably have issues out of the box because .... Google ¯_(ツ)_/ Mohamed Fixaal And they'll later release 10 new headphones and change their names later in because Google.. ¯_(ツ)_/ David’s Flattop Reigns Supreme Wow, Its a trifecta of wisdom!! Diego Opazo SV-Cross ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ After that they'll release a companion app ecosystem only to abandon them altogether because ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Ray And then one model will shut down randomly with 35% battery still remaining. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ David’s Flattop Reigns Supreme even more helpful.... Nexus✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Guess I've gotten mostly lucky, my two galaxy nexus, nexus 4, 5, 7, google home, chromecasts, nexus player, and pixel didn't have problems out of the box. my 5x developed crazy slowness over time rendering it barely useful (and I've flashed all sorts of roms and formatted storage and disabled encryption). Nigel Antonio im right there with you, but ad a nexus 1. and a Pixel to the mix. Dennis Lockhart Maybe but they'll be in 'beta' so a fix is just down the road a bit. ;-) 4Ui812 LOL Andrey Simakov They are Google because Google. David’s Flattop Reigns Supreme Well that was helpfull Glen Barrington Then they'll abandon the whole thing because Google.. ¯_(ツ)_/ John Marshall’s Ghost Why isn't this USB C? I have a Pixel XL and my wife has the Nexus 5X. We have switched our lives over to USB C. Why would I want to carry around another cable or an adapter just for a set of headphones? I have not been able to find a set of USB C wireless headphones and for the life of me, I can't understand why. vmxr ugly Cael That G looks like a Q to mean. Clearly the Nexus Q2 /s Thomas Larsen It's a power button Cael I was being sarcastic... Thomas Larsen I know, even without the /s makiller The manual showing an aux cable included reinforces for me that Google will keep the headphone jack on the next Pixel again. I doubt they'd include an aux cord with their new branded headphones if their new branded phone couldn't even use it..... right? These are kind of ugly though. ITGuy11 Right. Cause your going to need that headphone jack due to Pixel 2 Bluetooth issues ¯_(ツ)_/¯ JG Counter point... That assumes everyone at Google will be using the Pixel 2. I would imagine some (especially those developing for iOS) use iPhones. And several probably carry around Galaxy devices etc... You don't have to eat McDonalds for every meal just because you work there... You're also further assuming the aux cord is to be plugged into the phone. Maybe the aux port is included so the headphones can connect to the employee's computer terminal. Or maybe the equipment in the campus gym, like at my gym, lack bluetooth and need a wired connection in order to listen to the built in TV/music player. Or since Google will only need a small quantity I would imagine it would probably have been easier and cheaper just to use parts already in production rather than asking whoever is actually building them to create custom hardware for a relatively small order. That would also explain why the charge port is microUSB and not USB-C. DanSan just curious, is there a reason why you'd expect a microphone for these? I'm just guessing here but these don't look like gaming or professional use headphones which would be the only time they might require a mic. This looks more like trying to capture the hype of other products like beats. No idea but do beats have a built in mic? I get it, maybe it would be good for assistant if it had a mic but not sure i see lack of microphone a drawback, especially when similar headphones dont have them matteventu For... Calls? DanSan do other headphones that look or fit in this same category have the same functionality? i only ask because the article is written as if not having a mic is a knock against the product yet i dont think anything else in this space has a mic. Miku is Best Vocaloid Most of them do. matteventu Aurevoir 3.5mm jack on Pixel 2. Damnit. Fr0gg0 It's not like anyone outside Google would want to wear those. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Never underestimate the power of branding. sebastianer Yeah....for less than 150€ you can get some AKG K701s headphones.(that you can mod if you need more Low frequency). And for 100 USD you can get a Schiit Fulla 2 amazing DAC and reasonable good amp. That's all you need for a decent audio quality nowadays. Tom Harman Yes Please! Jeffrey Spiers I'll be scouring Ebay for these... icyhotmike Supported for 3 months and then left dry to die a slow and unfixed death -Every Google product KRS_Won Google Listen™ Built with Cast® I'd prob buy em. Rinkesh621 Those earmuff bezels tho ! Complimentary with Pixel 2? Alfonso Surroca It's a shame this headset is internal-only. A Google headset such as this would fit nicely with their consumer product mix, especially if it only worked in conjunction with all-new dedicated messaging and voice apps. G Suite Headset Messenger by Google has a nice ring to it. Rod Moore What is this AUX you speak of? All of Goggles phones have USB-C ports. Plus the Chromebooks are coming out with USB-C. Very odd to be using a older USB auxiliary port. hzd Bluetooth Google headphones . . . Haha expect less work to get done at Google from here on in, Google's relationship with any BT is always Rocky !

Multi-user voice recognition is rolling out to Google Home today Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/20 9:01am PDTApr 20, 2017 78 Plus 1 on G+ 138 Share on Facebook 97 Share on Twitter Total Shares313 Google News Videos Update 1: 2017/04/20 12:02pm PDT Here is the setup flow, courtesy of Artem Russakovskii: Bringing Google Assistant out of the phone and dropping it into Google Home comes with some difficulties. Not the least of which is, how do you handle personal account preferences and data when Google Home is available to everyone in the house? Until now the solution has been "don't." Starting today, you can register multiple users with your Google home, which recognizes them by voice. To set this up, look for a device card in the Home app that says"Multi-user is now available" or "Link your account." The setup process has you say the "OK Google" and "Hey Google" hotwords twice each. From then on, Google Home will be able to provide personal results because it knows who you are. The same is true for up to five other people in the house. The personal results affected by multi-user include My Day, calendars, flights, shopping lists, photos, and more. Each user of Google Home will also be asked to set some preferences for things like video and music services. If you set up a new user and don't do that, Google Home just defaults to the ones used by the first account. You can get started fiddling around with this today, but only in the US. Multi-user will roll out to the UK in the coming months. Update 1: 2017/04/20 12:02pm PDT Here is the setup flow, courtesy of Artem Russakovskii: Previous Next End of Update Source: Google Blog,  Google Support 1, Google Support 2 Tags Google google assistant google home video subscribe ...

Evolutionary at best. cusaitech Will this prevent ads from activating Google home? Jonathan Berry I believe unrecognized users will continue to work, just without the personalization it can do if it recognizes you. Shagnscooby I'm wondering if you can specify the default account if it's an unrecognized person. The biggest reason I've been looking forward to this is because of someone in my house using the Google Home for music with GPM and me in the car listening and it stops playing because of simultaneous streams. I'd probably specify one of my kids as the default account so it never overlaps my listening. Kakairo Yes! Can't wait to set this up when I get home. Hopefully adding calendar events and reminders isn't far behind. Carson Saldanha Roll out... :( Kakairo I've been lucky with roll outs lately, hopefully that streak continues. surethom UK coming month not good. Will this FINALLY let us ask for my music uploaded by artist name & song to play without a subscription? DzMn Can I pick your brains if you have a Google Home surethom? I was thinking about getting one of these but I'm not exactly sure what the thing can currently do in the UK. My two main uses would be: 1) Play music, this is my main thing. I use GPM but do not have a subscription, I usually just play music from the MicroSD Card in my phone, but was thinking of uploading my whole collection to GPM so I can access it online. I take it from your comment above, it's not possible to play any music unless you have a GPM subscription, is that correct? 2) Set Alarms and Calendar entries. Can you do either of these yet or are they not available? surethom Hi no problem. Yes I don't have any subscriptions just uploaded my 10,000 songs. You can ask ok google play my music, & it will start playing randomly, you can create Playlists, Ok google play my morning Playlists. But you Cannot say ok google play michael jackson thriller or ok google play music by coldnplay. It still cannot add to calendar but I think you can set alarms I'm not sure on the top of my head. Also the Google home has a very high bass level, I prefer a lower bass. I have created a few YouTube clips. https://youtu.be/16hS84ZJrDc DzMn Thanks for the detailed info, I appreciate it :) Hmmm, I might wait a bit then to see if they update it. I do often want to play just a specific artist, so that would be a bit annoying in its current state if it can't do that. Same goes with the Calendar, I always have lots in my calendar and it would be nice to add entries rather than just read current ones. Thanks again for getting back with what it can and can't do, I think I'll hang on for a bit and see if/when they add this stuff. If they do I'd certainly be interested. Cheers Defenestratus Thank goodness. I'm really sick of having my wife's terrible music selections showing up as recommendations in GPM. MrCalifornia If my wife doesn't have her own Google Music subscription can she not play music on Google Home anymore?

Chad Cardwell I have the same question/concern, though I think it may have been answered in the article when he said: "Each user of Google Home will also be asked to set some preferences for things like video and music services. If you set up a new user and don't do that, Google Home just defaults to the ones used by the first account." Nicholas Conrad Sign up for that family plan son. surethom So each person has to upload all there music to each account for Playlists to work? Or can you ask for any Playlists from somone else's music uploaded? Still Google. Does not explain properly. trickytree1984 Same question Rob Also wondering Scott Olsen I'm guessing I still won't be able to link my work account to my personal account so that I can get both calendar events when I ask about my day. M. Luciano Not without sharing your calendar to the other account.

Shoudl i try to transfer everything over to my consumer gmail account and just share my biz calendar to personal?

David Hyman Will this allow me to use my Spotify account on my phone while my wife uses hers on our Google home? jonzey231 As long as she specifies her Spotify account under her profile, I wouldn't see why not.

Opinion: Google should fix its erratic reminder system Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/26 2:15pm PDTApr 26, 2017 14 Plus 1 on G+ 52 Share on Facebook 46 Share on Twitter Total Shares112 Applications Editorials Google Article Contents 1 Input methods 2 Quick Access 3 Notifications 4 Allo and Home 5 Conclusion The ability to quickly set a reminder on your phone is one many of us take for granted these days. Smartphones have seemingly always had this basic PDA functionality. Type ‘add reminder’ into the Google search box and you’ll be able to quickly set up a notification to jog your memory about something later on. You can even use the ‘OK Google’ voice command: “remind me to pick up the groceries at 6pm,” for example. Easy-peasy. For most people, this function is used occasionally for something really important they simply mustn't forget. And for those people, it probably works just fine. However, for some people (like me) reminders have become an absolute necessity. I hate to admit it, but I have a really bad memory. Truly awful. For this reason, I am almost entirely dependent on Google’s system of reminders to navigate through each day. My phone will buzz with a reminder around 15 times per day. Some of these are one-offs. Some are recurring. All of them are to remind me to do something important, and without them, there’s no telling what I might forget to do. Don’t get me wrong, I am incredibly grateful that I am able to set reminders on my phone at all. But my extensive use of Google’s reminder system has also led me to conclude that it is inherently flawed. The biggest issue, as I see it, is a lack of consistency. Allow me to explain. Input methods There are currently no fewer than 6 distinct reminder input methods available to a typical Android user: Google app (including Google Assistant on compatible devices) Inbox Keep Calendar Chrome Allo Assistant With so many options, there’s always a convenient way to add a reminder to your Google account, whatever you happen to be doing when the need arises. Not all reminders are created equally, however. Add a reminder using any of the first 3 methods in the list and you’re offered the same basic options, such as when or where you’d like to be reminded and if you’d like the reminder to repeat. Inbox insists on using its ‘snooze’ terminology to denote reminder time, which isn’t ideal but we can handle that. Keep reminders are obviously linked to a specific note so you may not always want to use this option if you’d prefer your notes list to stay nice and tidy. They do still show up in your reminders list on the Google app, though, and can be dismissed from there accordingly. You cannot edit Keep reminders from within the Google app, however. To do that you’ll have hit the “Open in Google Keep” link and go through to the app itself. A Keep entry in the Google app's reminders list. If the experience already seems a little messy, it’s when you add a reminder to the Google Calendar app that things start to get weird. Firstly, these entries default to an ‘all day’ event, which seems a little counter-intuitive. It’s not difficult to change this to a timed reminder, but it's a slight annoyance that this option isn't the default. Secondly, unless you have the ‘Reminders’ box checked, which makes all of your reminders visible in your Calendar, none that you set here will actually deliver a notification. Having this option checked may not be a problem if you have one or two reminders set over the course of the week. But as I’ve already explained, I have many, many more than that. So when I set the Reminders calendar to be visible, in order to have the notifications working, my Calendar looks like this… My eyes!!! It even includes distinct entries for recurring reminders. So if you have a reminder set to recur every day it will show up in the month view for every single day, rather than just the next instance. The result is a mess. Needless to say that completely rules out Google Calendar as a method of input for me. Unfortunately, it took a couple of missed reminders when I didn’t have the option checked to figure out that the calendar functioned in this way. This was obviously frustrating, and I was lucky not to miss out on even more important notifications before I realized they weren't showing up. Another potentially handy way to set a reminder is by searching ‘add reminder’ on the Google homepage in your browser (on desktop or mobile). Regardless of browser or OS, if you’re logged into your Google account you should be able to easily set a reminder this way. Of course, there are a couple of limitations here too. First of all, there is no option to set a recurrence if you use this input method. You can revisit the entry in the Google app later on and set a recurrence there, but that kind of defeats the purpose of being able to add it in your browser in the first place. The second issue is that you can only set the reminder for predetermined times of the day. These include morning, afternoon, evening or night, as well as set times of on the hour (12:00) or half past the hour (12:30). This simply isn’t specific enough for certain tasks, and as a result, I tend to steer clear of adding reminders this way (except in an emergency), preferring the other more feature-rich methods. Quick Access At the moment there isn’t an especially fast way to enter a reminder input from your Android phone’s launcher. The ‘OK Google’ hotword (or Google Assistant on compatible devices) is easily the fastest method currently available, but there are still many of us who don't wish to talk loudly at our phones in public. Or even in private, for that matter. It's also worth mentioning that if you use the voice method this can often lead to misunderstandings or having to type extra information anyway. The Screen Search reminder button - simply not fast enough. The easiest solution would seemingly be to have a one-tap option to go straight into a reminder from your device homescreen. Instead, we have to long-press of the home button (on non-Assistant devices) which brings up Screen Search (previously Now on Tap) and click the pink Reminder button, or we can type ‘Add reminder’ into the search bar or Google app. Both of these routes often feel painfully slow. We do have app shortcuts for Calendar and Keep, which is great. But each app comes with its own feature limitations, discussed earlier, which preclude me from considering either as a viable option. If only the Google app has an "Add reminder" app shortcut or widget, the process would be a breeze. App shortcuts - why can't the Google app copy this approach? If you want to view and manage your reminders list there are several ways to do so. The Google app has a reminders list in the menu, and this is probably the most complete, robust way to manage them. Inbox displays them as pinned items in among your emails, or you can filter out everything else and view them in their own list, which functions similar to the list in the Google app. You can also snooze these in Inbox just as you can with emails. Keep has a section showing any notes that have reminders set against them, but doesn’t concern itself with any reminders not attached to one of its own notes. Lastly, Calendar (as you can see in the image further up) displays every single upcoming reminder alongside all of your other events, rendering it practically unusable. Notifications More examples of inconsistencies across these apps can be found in the notification shade. How each reminder is displayed and the quick actions associated with each vary widely. To dismiss this I must mark all 8 as ‘Finished’, including two I can't even see. When you have multiple Google app reminders they are bundled together in a single notification, rather than separated out into individual items. The only action you can perform is to mark all as ‘Finished’, dismissing every one of them at once. Another thing to remember is that notifications in Nougat only show up to 6 lines of content per app at any one time. So, in the example above there are two reminders I can’t even view without entering into the app. When you do enter into the app to mark individual items complete, that dismisses the notification from the shade entirely. If you were hoping to leave it there for the rest of the day as a glanceable to do list, you’re out of luck. Calendar reminder notifications similarly give you only the option to mark as done, but where they improve over the Google app is that you can tap into each individually and edit the reminder time on the next screen. This won’t affect the other notifications from the app. Inbox notifications are bundled rather more usefully, with each being individually expandable and giving the option to either mark as ‘Done’ or to ‘Snooze’. This offers you greater control over your tasks. While this is much closer to how it should be done, Keep refines this even further. Its notifications are also unbundled and come with two individual actions to choose from, snooze for an hour or snooze for even later. Swipe away the notification and you dismiss the reminder altogether, condemning it to the ‘Past’ section of the reminders list in the Google app. The exception being recurring reminders, which will still come back the next time they are set to recur. This is arguably the best way to handle reminder notifications, but you have to be happy to clog up your Keep list with reminders in order to utilize this. Keep's reminder notification - best in class. Your Google Now feed is yet another place you can interact with your reminder notifications. There, it’s possible to snooze reminders for an hour or mark as finished. But there seems to be little rhyme nor reason to how long reminder cards remain actionable in Google Now. It’s not uncommon for me to see a notification in Google Now long after I’ve dismissed it elsewhere, and vice versa. While the cards remain useful in some instances, this isn't a reliable way to manage your task list. Allo and Home Some of you may have noticed that I haven’t mentioned how the Google Assistant in Allo handles reminders. That’s because for some reason these reminders are kept completely separate from all those discussed above. They won’t appear in any of the other apps and can only be viewed in the Allo app when it notifies you. The notification is displayed as a message from the Assistant itself and it doesn’t appear as though you can snooze it at all, not even if you ask really nicely. Allo isn’t the only way to interact with the Google Assistant, of course, the other being Google Home. You might think that reminders would be a key function of the smart home device, but curiously you still can’t ask Home to remind you of something, months after its release. Even the addition of multi-user support hasn't yet brought with it the ability to add reminders. Much has been written about Home and Assistant still feeling like beta products. With omissions like this, it’s hard to disagree with that. Conclusion By experimenting with Google’s reminder system across all of these apps and interfaces, it’s probably possible to eventually find a way to make it work for you. I would argue that you shouldn’t have to work quite so hard to utilize what is in essence quite a basic service. I’ve tried countless other Android apps in a bid to satisfy my reminder needs, and effectively replace my defective memory. But nothing seems to hit the right balance of good design, usability, and features. Plus, there’s no substitute for being able to easily access my reminders from any device on which I can access my Google account, something Google’s reminder system still boasts over every other option on the Play Store. Still, there has to be a way to merge all of these separate interfaces and functions into a less frustrating experience. I'm sure this isn't a huge priority at Google, but I can dream, can't I? A discrete Google Reminders app would seem an obvious solution. One that plugs into the other Google services but ultimately acts as a standalone master-app might be the best way to alleviate some of these shortcomings and offer the experience I expect from a service like this. Then again, maybe it’s just me. Maybe I’m the only person who uses reminders to quite this extent and I should, in fact, seek help. Hopefully, that’s not the case. And hopefully someone at Google uses reminders just as much as I do, and with just as much frustration. Tags allo calendar google app google assistant google home inbox keep subscribe ...

Anything I set using voice is getting marked as done within 10 minutes of them notifying me. At first I thought I was crazy, I was seeing reminders in my Inbox that I had set while driving, but an hour later I'd say to myself "Wait didn't I set a reminder to do X?", only to find I HAD created the reminder, but it was marked as done. I can't figure it out! I opened a ticket with Google only to have some rep tell me I needed to clear my cache, but it still happens even when all my devices are off and browsers closed. Kevin Luther Yup. They have been really messed up. I keep finding them marked as done when j never even got the notice Simon Levin Yes that happens to me all the time. I've come to not rely on reminders for anything serious. catalysto I regularly encounter quirks like this with Google reminders. It's for this reason (and all the other stuff Scott said) that I only ever interact with them via Inbox. Fortunately, I enjoy using Inbox, so using that method is relatively painless for me, but for those who don't... Well hopefully the nightmare ends soon. A centralized reminder database/app seems to be the best solution. ShahinTr I just use events. I never bother using reminder, it's an absolute waste of time and space on calendar. Charles222 I've largely abandoned reminders in favor of calendar events and todoist. Todoist in particular, since it has equally-favored apps for the three OS's I use and Home support. David Ruddock Todoist seems very robust. I always consider trying it, then just don't because most of my reminding comes from calendar events, as you say. I want the solution to feel as integrated as possible. Scott Scrivens I have tried Todoist but I didn't like it. I don't actually remember why though...maybe I'll give it another shot. Waveblade Second on Todoist, just replacing it outright is better and the interface is way better than any other ones I've used. The other thing is context awareness is great. "Send email today at 4PM #" will figure out where it all goes. That is the killer feature about it wheelingdad If you need to set 15 reminders a day then you might look inward instead of trying to create/change a system that fits your issue. Just saying... Scott Scrivens pls halp Bruce Wayne Exactly. 15 reminders in a day is just absurd. I saw one of his screenshots and there was a reminder to "charge his phone". That says it all. Matt That calendar is what Leonard from Memento would have if they made that movie today. XerBlade Everything was just peachy for me using Inbox's reminder tools for all of this... until recently. For the last couple weeks, Google has made an incredibly asinine change where time-based notifications will automatically be marked as Done in just under an hour if you don't do it yourself. Which really mucks things up when you're, what's a simple example that's easy to convey... Say you set a reminder a while back that you forgot about (which is pretty much why you set a reminder in the first place), and it goes off while you're in a movie (and you didn't adjust it to go off later on after you're back from the movie beforehand because, you know, you don't have eidetic memory which is why you need reminders in the first place). Said reminder goes away on its own before the movie ends, so you never actually see it. That kind of BS has been happening to me DAILY since this started. [Notifications you just leave sitting in your inbox forever and never "Snooze" are fine though. Yay.] Kevin Luther I have been missing so many reminders lately as well. It's utter garbage destinyhud Here is what i do. I use google app to set all reminders. it will flow to calendar and keep is just for note taking. Now i set calendar events for more important thing to be reminder me a second time just to be be careful like my monthly mortgage Scott Scrivens This is essentially what I do currently. I wish it just worked from everywhere though. blahmoomoo Allo's subscriptions are kind of broken anyway, though I don't know if that also applies to recurring reminders. I told Allo to tell me the weather every morning, but if you don't chat with the bot on occasion, it stops doing that after about a week. Then I forget that it was supposed to remind me about the weather for a few days after each time that happened. So I have ultimately given up on it. EDIT: to be clear, the subscription is still there. It just forgets to keep sending it after a while if you don't talk to the bot, intentionally or not. 4Ui812 Google needs to fix more than just the reminder system. This is probably the least of their problems. Grey They should also bring Reminders to Gmail. Why is it Inbox-only? The other Inbox feature, Email Reminders, should be baked into the next version of Google. After that, what makes Inbox different? Jason Bell The biggest issue I've been having is that reminders don't always give me a real notification. It's always there in the Google App when I open it, but sometimes there's no notification. sam1331 I was just looking into this today. I've become increasingly dependent on reminders, and basically use it as my to do list these days. However, it definitely could be improved. The thing about the notifications is huge, if I have multiple pop up I have to click on the notification to dismiss one, and then the others are no longer sitting there in my notifications. Then I have to reschedule them to get them to sit there again, which is the whole point of the entire system. If they disappear from my notification shade, how will I remember to do them? I might as well not even use Google's reminder system at all then. It's just so convenient to type "remind me to..." in the search box and have it add whatever it is. MisterAlex I recently got a reminder notification for a "when I get home" reminder that I'd set over a year ago. No freakin' clue what made this particular arrival at home special enough to trigger it again... :v Jen Once they get all THIS stuff straightened out, I'd love the ability to set reminders by Time AND Location. For example, I'd love to say "Remind me to do laundry when I get home tonight" while I'm still at home in the morning... Right now, that would just "remind" me immediately since I'm still at home, or if I set it to a specific time, it might remind me before I get home in the evening or after I've been home a while. It'd also be useful for locations that have open/close times, like stores, where a location-only reminder won't be helpful if you frequently walk by at a time when it's closed. Having a Time + Location context would be immensely helpful! N8SLC This works for me. I use the assistant mostly. Scott Scrivens This. This would be so useful. PHLAK I also rely on reminders heavily. Hover, I limit myself to just using them through Inbox (both on the web and phone) to avoid all this complication. A stand-alone reminders app to "unify" reminder functionality would be awesome. Crossstick You & me Scott. I'm on a 12 person sales team plus a manager. NO ONE, but me uses automated reminders. I can't live without 'em. Ever since the original Palm Pilot ! Keep is my main workhorse for the past couple of years. Alex Renna This is the reason I switched to using a To-Do app (Todoist). There used to be a Gmail add-in (#todo) that stopped development after Google implemented Reminders on Calendar, and acted like you stated, only one occurrence that would move days until it was completed. If that made a come back I would be a happy man. kimbo I haven't had to make any reminders recently but I thankfully haven't experienced these issues before Cakefish I use Keep reminders a few times a month for important stuff like meetings and deadlines. Dozens of reminders a day? I wouldn't want to be that dependant on technology to function properly in everyday life. I can usually remember the mundane everyday stuff pretty well on my own, such as remembering to buy food and eat it, drink to keep myself hydrated, charge my phone when the battery gets low, go to the toilet, breathe in and out etc. Everyone's different though! Each to their own. Shakil Shaikh Jut install Tasks, the app formally known as Astrid: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.tasks Workflow wise, resizable/fiterable widgets do it for me (they also provide a quick way to enter a categorised task). Persistent notifications help in some cases too. Mostly though, it's the only to-do app that offers recurring tasks on both scheduled date (every 3rd Monday) or on completed date (3 weeks since last completed). It'd probably be quicker and healthier than waiting for Google to create some kind of compromised workflow for you instead. Scott Scrivens I was actually an avid Astrid user back in the day. Miss that little octopus. My issue with this as a solution is that I always need to use my phone. I'm looking for cross-device/platform integration. LaserWraith I tried to use Google's reminders in the past but gave up for reasons similar to yours. Todoist keeps me on track now across all my devices and it's pretty great. Some flaws still, but a big improvement. Raymond Berger Have you tried TickTick? I've been using it for years and it was been absolutely fantastic. It works across many platforms and has a relatively simple interface but also plenty of options for power users. Trip66 Been using it for years I love it...Bought it Immediately.+1 N8SLC You can de-select the reminders calendar. As for the rest, I think the sheer volume is on you. ;) Scott Scrivens You can, but then any reminder you set using Calendar won't work. Deeco PREACH AP!!! Please make more articles like these to highlight these simple anoying flaws. Let us be heard and get Google off​ their backside! ellett Why can't a reminder play a sound? As it stands now you can get an email or have a notification pop up, but everything is silent, which is useless if I'm doing something else when the reminder triggers. If I need an alarm, I have to set a reminder several hours in advance to remind me to set a phone alarm. Sophie Yes, many of these things have been bothering me, too! The state of Google's reminder system is much like their chat/messaging apps: confusing and fragmented (Ok, maybe it's not as bad as the chat/messaging apps). Like the author, I also rely on reminders (my calendar looks alot like his!). I primarily interact with them through the Google app, as well as a script I wrote for the Linux command-line that allows me to quickly add timed reminders (Google calls them quick events) to a special "My reminders" calendar (I wish I could save them to the default Reminders calendar that Calendar and the Google app seem to use, but it seems off-limits to developers). If Google's voice-to-text translation was better, I would stick to the Google app, I really don't mind talking at my phone, in public or otherwise, but it's not great. I have to correct things so often that I might as well type it in half the time (hence the command-line script). bdbplatano 🍻 Here's to hoping Google's paying attention🍻 Wolfie410 My biggest issue had to do with recurring reminders set through Google Now/Assistant. I was unable to clear a reminder ahead of schedule, without completely deleting the future occurrences of the recurring task. The only other option was to wait for the notification to pop and then dismiss it. Not very convenient. Have beem using the splendo to-do list. Rudresh Another way is to set an alarm with a note, works best for me. Lateef Alabi-Oki I wonder how hard it is to create a single reminder service, with a consistent API and behavior, that all their front-end services and third-party apps can use? Just thinking out loud here. Bruce Wayne I can't imagine why you would need a reminder to charge your phone. Trip66 Many of these shortcuts can be added to the homescreen in most launchers and especially in Nova but I use the OK Google method and several times a day. "Remind me in one hour that at 2pm so and so is coming by to.... That type of stuff... and I plan my whole day everyday so I don't forget someone is coming by or I have to be somewhere etc etc. It's a godsend to me and I can do it all hands free and 90% of the time it's in the car via BT. Awesome.ability. I fix computers all day so I'm always picking up or dropping off and also people drop and pickup to me so it reminds me when so I dont leave if someone is coming over or I have to be to their place at a specific time. But I haven't had any issues with them being marked as done or anything and they always go off at the time I say to. Viral Kacha https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5ee1efd75a870942aa10e7ecb1adcdfe05ac836338f4823d2d7a45180f970b2b.png "If only the Google app has an "Add reminder" app shortcut or widget, the process would be a breeze." Inbox app has the widget and it's quite neat and inclusive of all the features. Luzandro I also use the inbox widget, which works quite well for me, except when the shown presets for snoozing aren't appropriate (which is quite often the case for me, as the soonest suggestion is in the evening) it takes surprisingly many steps to choose something different TedPhillips yesss. the bundling gets me since if i finish one reminder but have a few overlapping (but not too many like you), need to be very aggressive but also careful about notification shade grooming. out of sight out of mind and all that. A+ Simon Levin Thank you. If only Google cared to fix their old products. Nathan J For me, reminders have always been crap on both platforms. On Android, I used an app called Lotify. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nll.lotify The nice thing about this app is that you have a ton of options, and a huge selection of icons to choose from, so if you have a lot, they stand out from one another. I expected iOS to be leaps and bounds ahead, because an iPhone just works, right? Not so fast. I found iOS lacking in that regard. Via Reddit, I found an app called "HiFutureSelf" that simulates a text message. You put in the message and the time you want to receive it. You can set a unique ringtone for the app. And when the time comes, you get your message. It suits my purposes. There might be better options, but I haven't seen any, personally. Ryan Warmack Business calendar pro hits the nail on the head for me. ilovetesla can anybody petition google to make adding birthdays and anniversaries to calendar easy Alicia Frederick Inbox has a widget you can add to the home screen on your phone for single tap quick access, which might help with the notifications since Inbox does them better. Jeremy Couch One thing that I hate is that when you dismiss Android notifications of reminders from Keep they mark it as Done. So I stopped using Keep for reminders. Very annoying. Ste Tan Excellent article. Reminders have been a pain for me as well throughout Google services. I've tried so many different apps—apps like todoist,etc— that just isn't as convenient for me compared to a native solution by Google. I eventually just went back to using Calender and keep for reminders and though it does become aggravating, I've grown to just deal with it since I need to use it daily. A Google reminders app would be perfect, especially since it would seemlessly sync and work consistently throughout all my Android devices plus any other device I have my Google account connected to. I really hope Google sees this article and takes it into consideration. Fabian Todt personally i like how google calender reminders show up, that's exactly how/why i use them: these are tasks/todos i have to do at this very moment so they are like an event/meeting. this is somehow similar to the getting things done method: i've got all tasks in todoist and plan them as reminders in calender when i have to do them. Neil S The article says that there is no widget for reminders that can be added to the home screen. I have one on my phone. The Google inbox app has a reminder set up widget which is quick to use. Just tape the reminder widget button and enter the reminder text, then hit the clock icon to set it for any time you like and to repeat if you like.

Bixby, the phone's new digital assistant, doesn't yet have one if its key features — voice recognition. This shortcoming wouldn't be so obvious if only Samsung hadn't included a new button on the side of the phone meant to launch Bixby. Thanks to some creative geekery, however, the seemingly useless button now has a purpose. Image: Alex Cranz/ Gizmodo The release of the Galaxy S8 is being staggered, so while Australia is receiving the phone tomorrow on April 28, the US has had it since April 21. Crafty new owners of the Galaxy S8 are reprogramming the Bixby button to launch various apps, including rival digital assistant software like Google Now. There are several ways to do this, but the easiest by far is by using apps like Bixby Button Remapper, BixRemap, Goodbye Bixby and Bixby Remap — all of which are available for free download in the Google Play Store. The apps essentially let you reprogram the Bixby button so that it can perform almost any task you'd like. That means that you can have it launch other apps, like the camera or flashlight — or you can do something as useful as reprogramming it to launch Google Now (not to be confused with Google Assistant, which is only available on certain phones). The programmer behind the Bixby Button Remapper told Gizmodo in an email that the app stemmed from a simple need. "I initially made the app because, well, I saw a need that wasn't being met yet," the programmer, who goes by Phascinate, explained. "Manufacturers do such a great job on the hardware of phones these days, but sometimes make some very odd decisions when it comes to software." Contacted for comment Samsung provided the following statement: With its intelligent interface and contextual awareness, Bixby will make your phone more helpful by assisting in completing tasks, telling you what you're looking at, learning your routine and remembering what you need to do. The Bixby button is dedicated to activating these features, starting with Bixby Home at launch and expanding to Bixby Voice later this Spring. There you have it! True to their hacker origins, the apps aren't exactly pretty. They're mostly ham-fisted experiments from developers that wanted to make use of the extra button on the Galaxy S8. The description of the Bixby Button Remapper app, for example, says that it doesn't actually monitor button presses on the phone. Instead, "it detects when the Hello Bixby app is on screen and instantly kills it and triggers whatever action you set within the app". The BixRemap app is equally as rudimentary, with the creator describing it as "[an app] designed in 20 minutes". First one that makes an app to remap the Bixby button on the Galaxy S8 to Google Assistsnt wins my $$$ — Marques Brownlee (@MKBHD) March 29, 2017 There has been great deal of interest in reprogramming the Bixby button since day one. Popular gadget reviewer Marques Brownlee (AKA MKBHD) issued an unofficial challenge to Android fans on the US launch day to anyone who was able to hack the Bixby button to launch the rival assistant product Google Assistant. The ability became possible in less than a week after his challenge through the All in One Gestures app, but Samsung reportedly eventually disabled the ability. But quite frankly, who can blame Galaxy S8 owners for wanting to get more utility from the extra button on their phones? It's completely reasonable to be frustrated by Samsung selling a phone for a minimum of $1199 that isn't even a finished product. Don't forget: This is supposed to be one of the best smartphones on the planet. It's easy to understand why people are so mad about this useless button.

Reply 1 ross_co @ross_co Apr 27, 2017, 10:42am Don't know how they would, button remap apps are actually pretty handy. Reply 0 projectkennedy @projectkennedy Apr 27, 2017, 10:55am Yes and no, as the article states, they blocked one way to do it. One of the apps doesn't even look for when the button is pressed, but when bixby is activated and just hijacks that.

From reports and leaks of the iPhone 8, Samsung might have the phone of 2017. Reply 0 cameronj @cameronj Apr 27, 2017, 12:11pm I just long press the home button for Google now/assistant, the camera is double tap power, I can't see a need to remap the Bixby button personally but everyone has their preferences Reply 0 Join the discussion!

Analysts for the Pivotal Research Group wrote that despite digital advertising outpacing the $69 billion spent on U.S. television advertising in 2016, it was not taking away ad dollars as many observers would expect.“Advertisers commonly look to allocate digital budgets to video ad units without necessarily impacting TV spending one way or the other,” the analysts said.The increase in ad spending, which was again dominated by Facebook Inc and Alphabet’s Google, comes as marketers are increasingly wary about where their ads show up online, and how effective it is for them. Facebook and Google accounted for 99 percent of the industry growth, said Pivotal Research, meaning that almost everyone else in the digital ecosystem was either flat or down from last year.Google’s YouTube is in the midst of an ad boycott on its digital video site YouTube after companies like Verizon Communications Inc and Johnson & Johnson found their ads appearing next to extremist and other hate content. Last year also saw Facebook admit to a string of measurement errors in the data is gives to advertisers regarding the amount of people that are watching their video ads. No Comments.

He discussed his recent book, “The Attention Merchants,” and who could be the winners and losers if net neutrality policy does change.  Kai Ryssdal: So Molly pointed out up top that you were the guy who is commonly credited with coming up with the phrase net neutrality, like, 13 something years ago. What were you thinking? What was your was your mindset? Tim Wu: Oh, well I thought, you know, alliteration would work. I mean the concept had been in around, maybe we need to think about the carrier's phone companies and cable and you know, when they got to the internet what they would do with it. And I just wrote a paper, and I was, like, well maybe they need to be neutral in how they treat stuff, and it's like looking around. My original phrase was "inter-network neutrality." That didn't really catch on. And then I came up with "network neutrality" and then "net neutrality." The other term I had was "broadband discrimination," and I didn't know which was going to catch on. And somehow, you know, these things you can't control language. And that's what caught on somehow. Molly Wood: What are you thinking as you watch this sort of new FCC address, zero rating. Maybe talk about overturning Title II reclassification. Where's your mindset about the future right now? Wu: Well, I'm not completely surprised. Pai made one of his trademark ideas to be against net neutrality regulation. Actually, he sometimes said he likes net neutrality as a principle but doesn't think there should be any enforcement of it. That’s the kind of things people will say sometimes to be polite, I guess, in a sense, because the underlying idea of net neutrality is very popular, and this gets to my comment — I think it may end up being a little harder than it looks. Ryssdal: You mean unpacking what's been done so far? Wu: Yeah, undoing net neutrality, reversing the regulation may be harder than it looks. And I'm not sure it's within Pai's power in the short term. You know, I don't want to get into the legal reason, but basically when an agency does something, it's not that easy a year later, two years later to undo it unless you have a reason. Wood: So I want to go back to zero rating just for a second only because at the top of the show, Kai said he didn't think that zero rating sounded like such a big deal. What do you think, Tim? Wu: Well, do I think it's the end of life? Ryssdal: Well, wait let me characterize what I said. Why can't I do what I want with my with my pipes, is in essence what I was saying. Wu: That's the same thing. You know, why not let Comcast block the New York Times if they want to do a deal with Bloomberg or something? You know, it has to do with what whether you think certain parts of the nation's infrastructure that should be somewhat neutral, should, you know, carry content equally. You know the phone networks just take a classic example. You're not allowed to block some people from calling other people. You have to be open, electric networks you can plug in any appliance. Question has always been "Should the internet be the same?" And sure, there are owners, but they're owners of what is essentially a public calling, a public kind of business. And it's been like that, for you know, for hundreds of years or at least a 150 years. And I think it's something that's been very good for the economy and for the culture of the United States. Kai Ryssdal: Let me get a listener question in here. A guy by the name of Les Krauss wrote, and he wants to know if you could give us a sense of the winners and losers as policies toward net neutrality change in this administration. Wu: So in terms of private sector? Ryssdal: Yeah. Wu: I mean, the winners are unquestionably the cable companies and the phone companies and their wireless versions in the sense that they have the opportunity to go around all these internet companies if net neutrality starts to fade and be like, "Hey, give us more money or we're going to mess with you." You know, kind of Tony Soprano business model. That looks good for them. There is a chance that some of the big internet companies end up being winners in a certain sense. They, if they cut a sweetheart deal, let's say Google or Facebook cut a big sweetheart deal with Comcast, then it becomes even harder to compete with them. You know, if you're poor little duck-duck-go or some other search engine and now Google not only is Google, but they also now have this deal with Comcast Charter, and, you know, the other big phone companies and broadband companies, it's like, "Wow that's even harder to get started." So they are also potentially winners. It kind of depends. Yeah, so basically good for the big guys, bad for diversity of speech, bad for innovation, bad for a dynamic economy. That's my bottom line. Bad for entrepreneurs, very bad for entrepreneurs in the sense that you know the internet has fostered a huge amount of entrepreneurism based on the idea you write an app or you write a program and you just reach people all over the internet. Well, what if it's now OK, now you have to sort of make a deal with Comcast and Comcast is already friends with Google, so Google says no don't do that deal with them. It gets a lot more difficult when you have motivated private owners of the public infrastructure. So I think it's terrible, but that's of course I do. Wood: I like it though, that's a good summation. Let's talk about your book which I think you know that sounds like an awkward transition but we're really talking about the power of communication. And like I said this book couldn't be more timely. "The Attention Merchants," and as our producer described it as a high-speed chase which I think it kind of is, of the history of almost 200 years of advertising and entertainment, and political and technological influence seekers. What made you tackle this topic and did you know it was going to turn out to be so timely now? Wu: You know, I didn't know. Great question. A mixture of academic and personal reasons. Personally, I had these experiences where I started noticing that I was losing control of my own attention. You know I would sit down to write an email and then all of a sudden two hours go by, "What just happened?" You know and I was like something weird is going on here. And I kind of wanted to understand how that was going on and understand the attention economy better. I don't think we have a good feeling for it so I'm kind of a person who is all about going to the beginning of the Nile to find the source. And I wanted to see where it all started so that led me back to the early — I wanted to see where is this business model come from where you gather a crowd and resell their attention. It led me back to tabloid newspapers in the 1830s and you know it's a, I guess a high-speed chase, of just trying to get our you know minds and eyes focused on things for even tiny bits of time and make money off that. Ryssdal: It's so funny because you know tiny bits of time which is what our attention is sliced up into now. This idea of attention as a commodity is not a new thing as you point out. Wu: No, it's not you know broadcast television completely depended on the attention of viewers to make money. I pointed out newspapers. So it's new in the grand scheme of things. You know it's not like thousands of years old but it's old in terms of our generation where we think anything older than a year is old. So it's an ad in that sense but they're actually, I point out in the book, there is an even further tradition associated with religion and religious organizations wanting to have people have rituals where they pray every day or go to church on Sundays or keep certain times like the Sabbath,you know as sacred for them. These days we have primetime, you have got to check into Facebook every day. If you don't go to Facebook every day it's like a form of sin, at least to Facebook. So you know there's direct links between organized religion and the copying of those techniques which are in the book. And so it's a longer history in that sense. Wood: Yeah, and political propaganda and all of it. But you also point out that you know as sort of the realization that religious and political propaganda are things that can grab people's attention and that starts to get applied to advertising, you talk about how economic survival depends on grabbing the attention of more and more and more people and becomes a race to the bottom in some ways. So I guess the question is it like the same as every kid in the backseat. Are we there yet? Are we at the bottom? Wu: Oh, I think in many ways we are at the bottom. You know these things go through peaks and valleys. And I think we can come back but right now we're at a very, very low moment. You know we're at kind of where newspapers were at their worst during the heyday of fake news. The real heyday of fake news was in the 1830s. In fact the book opens with the very first so-called free or penny newspaper struggling and deciding that the key to solving old problems is publishing stories about life on the moon, which ultimately leads to discovery of man bats on the moon. Wood: Wasn't that there was a hole within the U.S. World and News report, right? There was a bat boy like that whole long bat boy thing that early 90s or something and I was like "Oh my God, it came from the New York side," and it blew my mind. Wu: Which was fake news. I mean fake news, you talk about race to the bottom. A good sign that you're in a race to the bottom is a proliferation of fake news and a loss of veracity in pervasive media. And so I think that's a pretty good warning sign. We've been here before. You know every so often you get to fake news. In totalitarian regimes are full of fake news. I mean that's just like the authority says what the news is and you never figure out what's right or wrong — Soviet Union, Nazi Germany. The fact that you know we're in that phase right now is to me a big warning sign. Ryssdal: Do you look at it and go, ‘Man, could have told you this was coming?’ Wu: You know if my book is successful it foretells, if I have been a genius I would have written this, but it foretells that there will arise a lord of the attention merchants who uses the techniques of commercial media, of celebrity reality television, and of sort of pervasive social media which can jump over the media and reach people directly like Twitter and uses that as a device towards accumulating political power and therefore transforming politics as we know it into a part of the entertainment industry.  Every sort of factor is there to predict the rise of Trump. The opportunity is just sitting there, and I sense that someone could grab it. I wasn't smart enough to think it would be him because I like many other people kind of think he's incompetent, but he's not incompetent at what it counts, which is he is winning. Look here we are again talking about him. He wins every attentional battle. If you’re keeping score ratings wise he is the winner of all-time. You know you go to other countries people are talking about him. So if you care about good results or you care about popularity, not a winner, but just pure ratings attention, amount of time focused on some person, he is the king of all the attention merchants.   Wood: OK, but Tim, you also talk as you sort of explore the cyclical nature of this attention pedaling and attention grabbing. You talk a lot about the backlash.... You know, if you could predict our sort of next backlash. Are we there? Is that this sort of protest economy that we're starting to see? Yu: I will tell you the grounds are all there. Now if you look at the long length of time, attentional strategies immersive, intrusive, intensive strategies, the one great hope is they eventually lead to a massive kind of backlash where people have had it. They can't stand any more just being subjected to intentional manipulation and control. And I believe you know there is the possibility of a real rejection of the ways we are gaining information right now and people moving away on mass to something different. I know exactly what that would be and it's not going to be easy but you know almost a mass ignoring. And you know, and I think I'll tell you that the current president’s greatest fear is not losing but being ignored and it will be a vast tuning out of just the nonsense and that in a really strange, almost like mythical way, would rob this presidency of its power. Ryssdal: That's interesting though because that requires, while the president only has one guy who has to do his own thing, the collective ignoring is a collective exercise of will communally by millions and millions. Yu: It would be very challenging and I as much as anyone can't resist like, "OK, what absurd thing just happened today?" But you know, like people got sick of "Jersey Shore" eventually right?  You know it happens. If you live by attention, you die by attention and believe it or not its the source of this presidency's power.  And you know those are the seeds of it, of some of the downfall. So I also think that there's some real opportunity for people to rethink the web and other public media and what we want for it. I think subscription models are on the rise, add free models on the rise. People are starting to understand if you want good content you actually have to pay for it. And I believe there's a potential for another golden age for the web and other internet content and like there is with TV where there's just enough money to go around for a lot of great stuff. So I'm actually optimistic, but I think we're in a very dark place right now.

New Atlas Lifestyle Science Technology Transport Search Subscribe Mobile Technology What we'd like to see in iOS 11 Emily Ferron April 26, 2017 We'll know more about iOS 11 after the WWDC, but here are some improvements we hope to see View gallery - 8 images Apple is expected to start outlining key details of its next mobile operating system, iOS 11, at its annual developer conference coming up in June. Until then, here is our (very reasonable) wish list for the improvements we'd like to see in the new OS. Voicemail transcription out of beta Sick of Ads? More than 700 New Atlas Plus subscribers read our newsletter and website without ads. Join them for just US$19 a year.More Information Apple rolled out voicemail transcription with iOS 10 and the feature has been labeled beta ever since. It seems like a minor addition considering the endless capabilities of our smartphones, but it's one that we appreciated immediately. It's convenient to see the content of a voicemail at a glance, as it often takes longer to listen to an entire message than to skip to the relevant parts. Apart from increased accuracy, the beta feature works well enough that we see little room for initial improvement. Souped-up Siri Siri was the first eponymous virtual assistant to hit our smartphones, but since then similar and competing technologies like Alexa, Cortana and Google Assistant have eclipsed Siri in function. Siri could be improved in any number of ways, but high on our wish list is better app integration. As of now, Siri can't follow simple commands like "Post to Instagram" nor can it understand the context of your current apps and activities. Considering the competition, Siri shouldn't just be a hands-free way to control your phone. It should also be able to make performing certain tasks with voice control easier than could be done manually. We also wish for an option for Siri to default to Google search results instead of Bing's, but, given Apple's and Google's contentious history, we won't hold our breath for that. Right now, you have to include the word "Google" in your voice command to get those results. Compelling uses for 3D Touch Apple introduced 3D Touch, its pressure-sensitive touchscreen technology, in the iPhone 6S. In 3D Touch-equipped devices, you can navigate differently based on how long and hard you press the display. For example, if you hold lightly on an app icon, it prompts the shaking-icon delete screen, but if you deep press an app icon, an app-specific contextual menu launches. There is lots of potential for 3D Touch, but we've yet to see it really come to fruition. iOS 10 introduced a greater number of deep-press shortcuts, but not many that significantly enhance the experience. So far, one of our favorite applications of 3D Touch is found in Velapp, a video app that creates a highlight reel based on your pressing action during recording. Apple could take a cue and integrate similar conveniences into its camera. Another idea: 3D Touch could also allow you to navigate with one finger in circumstances where you would normally need two. For example, it some instances it might be convenient to to deep press to zoom in and out on an image instead of being limited to the current pinching action. We hope Apple takes the convenience of one-handed operation into account when expanding uses for 3D Touch. Of course, we don't expect Apple to go all in with 3D Touch quite yet, simply because many current iOS devices (specifically, the iPhone SE and the entire iPad lineup) don't contain the technology. A strong cue from Google Photos Google Photos has a number of perks that Apple's Photos app lacks. Our favorites? Unlimited cloud storage for photos under 16 MP, smart content detection so you can search by keyword whether you've entered descriptors for your photos or not and built-in ways to create easily exportable animations. We think it's unlikely that Apple will cut its users a break on cloud storage, but it would be convenient if iOS rolled out with enhanced keyword organization options in Photos. iOS 10 introduced some searchability (you can search Photos for auto-generated categories like "dog' and "mountains") but we'd like to see a greater number of supported smart categories and the ability to manually enter a searchable description. At this point, many users have had iOS devices for several years and that means thousands of photos accumulated over time. We'd also like to see a way to easily export Live Photos as GIFs or video. There are third-party apps that do this, but there should be a native way to share Live Photos with non-iOS users. Even better, we would also appreciate built-in ways to create animations and collages directly from the camera roll. Group FaceTime Apart from adding the ability to make voice calls, Apple hasn't changed much about FaceTime since it first appeared with the iPhone 4. FaceTime allows one-on-one video calling between users, but group calling support would make it more enticing. Not only would this allow more scattered friends and family to have face-to-face conversations, it would also make FaceTime hold up better against competitors like Skype and Google Hangouts. A few unsubstantiated rumors suggest that group FaceTime is in fact arriving on iOS 11, but we'll have to wait and see. Customizable Control Center The Control Center is the gray panel that appears when you swipe upwards from the bottom of the display on your iPhone or iPad. It contains shortcuts to common tools like the flashlight and camera; iOS 10 expanded it so that if you swipe right, there's a second page with music controls. It's a convenient feature, but there's no way to personalize the Control Center to better serve your specific needs. For example, if you don't have an Apple TV, there's no need for the permanent AirPlay mirroring button. It would be great if users could choose a different tool or shortcut to take up that real estate. Given Apple's historical preference for prescription over customization, though, we wouldn't hold our breath for this one. Customizable default apps Count this as another pipe dream, but we wish Apple would allow iOS users to choose default apps for web browsing, music playing, e-mail, etc. that are different from Apple's preinstalled stock apps. There are slight workarounds – for example, you can delete the Mail app and install Gmail in its place – but this option isn't available for all of the iPhone's core apps, and these methods don't always play nice with other apps and system preferences. Apple typically launches major iOS updates alongside its annual smartphone flagships, so iOS 11 should officially launch with the next-generation iPhone 8 expected later this year. It's logical to wonder if OS updates will mirror the dramatic makeover rumored to be part of the 10th-anniversary iPhone, but we will know more after the WWDC. For more background, read up on the types of changes introduced by iOS 10.

Anyone who owns a voice-activated smart speaker, including Amazon Echo, knows it's perfect for the kitchen. Don't know how many teaspoons are in a tablespoon? Ask your speaker. Want to set a timer? Ask your speaker. Want to cook a pizza? Ask your speaker for a recipe. Unfortunately, Google Home's assistant had trouble with that last bit. While Alexa could tap into Allrecipe to serve up 60,000 recipes, Google Assistant was more limited in what it could do. Until now. Google has expanded the number of recipes available on Google Assistant by adding step-by-step instructions for “more than 5 million” meals. All you have to do is say “OK Google, let's make a chocolate cake.” Or, you can say “Send to Google Home" so that you can view the recipe using the Google Search app on iOS and Android. Either way, Google Assistant on Google Home will walk you through the recipe when it hears relevant commands. Amazon Echo vs Amazon Tap vs Echo Dot: What's the difference? Amazon's Alexa adds Allrecipes skill to help you cook over 60,000 recipes Say “OK Google, start cooking" to get a break down, and you can say “OK Google, repeat” to hear the last step once more. You can even say “Ok=K Google, what’s step three?” While Google Home could access a few recipes before, this latest update is a dramatic expansion that pulls from several big publishers, including “Bon Appetit, The New York Times, Food Network, and more", Google explained.

Skip to content Naked Security Computer Security News, Advice and Research sophos.com Free Tools Go Award-winning computer security news Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Feed Google takes aim at deceptive advertising of Play Store apps 04 Apr 2014 9 Android, Google, Mobile Post navigation Previous: Facebook bug bounty program paid out $1.5m in 2013 Next: Apple patch out, Fake support bust, Liquor store leak – 60 Sec Security [VIDEO] by John Zorabedian 0Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Google announced updates to its developer policies for the Play Store app market that will hopefully help the company crack down on the worst abuses of some Android apps, including deceptive and potentially harmful behavior without the user’s awareness. Through periodic updates to its policies, Google is attempting to clean up its Android market and punish developers who try to work around the rules against pornography, gambling, spyware, adware and malware – even as the number of apps in the Play Store has surged past one million with more added every day. Although the policy changes won’t stop developers from cramming free apps with advertising, the rules Google announced on 28 March 2014 make several adjustments to Google’s policy on what typically we would call adware. The biggest change to the policies is the addition of an App Promotion policy, which bans ad behavior such as silently downloading apps without user consent, and ads that use misleading pop-up warnings including simulated system, service, or app notifications or alerts. In an email to developers and in a post on Google+, Google notified developers that they have until 12 April 2014 to comply, or they risk having their apps bounced from the store. PUAs, aggressive pop-up ads, and drive-by downloads The Play Store developer policies now explicitly ban certain types of advertising behavior within apps and on advertising networks; misleading app descriptions on Play Store; silent downloads of the app without consent; and “push” advertising in the form of SMS text messages. Apps published on Google Play may not directly or indirectly engage in or benefit from the following behavior: Promotion via deceptive ads on websites, apps or other properties, including simulated system, service, or app notifications or alerts. Promotion or install tactics which cause redirection to Google Play or the download of the app without informed user action. Unsolicited promotion via SMS services. It is your responsibility to ensure that no ad network or affiliate uses such methods to direct users to pages that make your app available for download. These characteristics may not exactly qualify the apps as malware, but they sure do have the signs of a potentially unwanted app (PUA). Our SophosLabs threat researchers have identified thousands of PUAs – we’ll look at three of them that use some of these abusive promotional tactics. Plus, check out the security tips at the end of this article so you know how to avoid malware and PUAs. → There’s no agreed-upon definition of PUAs, which are sometimes called PUPs for potentially unwanted program. Although they are not classified as malware, PUAs may nevertheless introduce risks for security and privacy and can negatively affect a device’s usability. SophosLabs researchers Vanja Svajcer, who contributed to this article, and Sean McDonald, explore this topic in their technical paper Classifying PUAs in the Mobile Environment (PDF). → A special thanks to Ferenc László Nagy of SophosLabs Hungary for providing research for this article. Clean Master Clean Master is a wildly popular download, ranked number one in Google Play’s Tools category, according to TechinAsia.com, and is promoted as an “Android cleaner and optimizer,” including protection against malware. Despite its popularity, ads promoting Clean Master manipulate Android users with deceptive tactics when browsing websites within the app’s advertising framework. Ferenc László Nagy of SophosLabs Hungary has captured some pop-up ads that lead to Clean Master, warning you that your device has been infected with a virus. In the screenshot at right, you see that this particular pop-up ad says: Your Android has been infected with a virus. Tap OK to remove now On the buttons it says in Hungarian “Mégse” (Cancel) and “OK.” Only if you press “OK” the ad redirects you to the download of the Clean Master app, and does not “remove” the (fake) virus as the ad claims. According to the website Stayprotected.com, several other ads promoting Clean Master resemble warning screens informing you that your battery is running low due to “potential viruses” on the device. Mobogenie Mobogenie helpfully bills its apps as “Virus-free” – but that hasn’t stopped the developer from using deceptive practices including drive-by downloads of the Mobogenie app that could make it a PUA in Google’s eyes. After receiving numerous complaints about automatic downloads of the Mobogenie app, the company wrote a message to users on the Play Store declaring that it is working to fix the problem with one of its “promotional partners.” Dear Users, Recently we have understood that some of our users have been troubled by the automatic download of Mobogenie on to their Android Phones. While it has never been our intention to spam any user, we would like to apologise to them for the same. Having learnt that there was a technical issue with one of our promotional partners, we are trying our best to fix it at the earliest. Team Mobogenie keeps a close eye on all its promotions, and recommends the download of Mobogenie application only from reliable sources such as Google Play, Mobogenie.com and other partner networks. We ensure that there shall be no more inconvenience caused to any Android user in future. If you face this Problem or anything similar Issues again, Please write to us at Support@mobogenie.com with the below details. In the screenshot of the Mobogenie Market app shown at right, you see what the Mobogenie Market’s “Must Have” app screen looks like. (Click on the image for a larger version.) Naked Security writer Paul Ducklin commented that the market contains knock-off versions of popular apps, including the no-longer-available Flappy Bird game. Much like the mangled English of the Mobogenie to-users letter quoted above, the descriptions of the apps within the market are also rife with spelling and grammatical errors. Despite this rather glaring evidence of poor attention to detail by Mobogenie – which is, after all, not just an app vendor but an entire, alternative app market – the product is used by many millions of people, having been downloaded more than 10 million times from the Play Store alone. Mobogenie users might want to think twice about playing outside Google Play. Android Armor Android Armor is an anti-virus app closely tracked by SophosLabs researcher Vanja Svajcer. Vanja shared some ad screenshots that show how Android Armor violates Google’s developer policies with misleading claims that could trick the user into believing they need the app to prevent malware infection. One ad in particular with a giant red button to download the app (see screenshot) makes a false claim that the device is not protected, although our test Android was fully protected with several security products, including Sophos Mobile Security. Tips to avoid malicious or unwanted apps 1. If it looks suspicious, it probably is. Don’t click on ads that claim to find malware on your device or use big red Alerts! – as you don’t know what might be lurking behind it. 2. Use common sense when it comes to permissions. If an app requests access to your contacts or device settings, it should explain why. Don’t hesitate to refuse access if you’re not fully convinced. 3. Third-party app stores carry the greatest risk. Google Play isn’t perfect: malware-infected apps and PUAs evade its filters. But many third-party app stores are far riskier. You should avoid file-sharing sites offering free versions of apps that normally require payment. Many of these apps have been cracked and infected. 4. Use consumer reviews as guidance. Multiple negative reviews or warnings about app misbehavior deserve to be taken seriously. 5. Protect your data, protect your phone. Use encryption to scramble data stored on your device or on cloud-based storage services. That way, if your data leaks out or you lose your smartphone or tablet, your confidential information never falls into the wrong hands. 6. Get reliable malware protection for your Android. You always want to have anti-virus protection on your Windows PCs and Macs, but don’t forget your Android devices – they need protection too. Sophos Mobile Security for Android gives you anti-virus protection, including detection and blocking of adware and PUAs, loss and theft protection, plus a handy security and privacy advisor. You can download it for free from the Google Play Store. UPDATE (9 April 2014): We were contacted by Adam O’Neill, a representative of the Clean Master app which is made by KS mobile. He gave us this statement: We would like to be clear that we do not endorse this kind of advertising method. We use a variety of advertising partners around the world, and it would appear that some of them have started using underhanded tactics to turn a greater profit. We are currently in the process of identifying the offending partners and rectifying the situation, as we do whenever we receive similar feedback from our users. We apologize unreservedly to anyone who was misled into downloading Clean Master under false pretenses, and hope that we can win back the trust of anyone who now views us with suspicion.

Photo / Getty Images Larry Page has his flying cars. Sergey Brin shall have an airship. Brin, Google co-founder, has secretly been building a massive airship inside of Hangar 2 at the NASA Ames Research Center, according to four people with knowledge of the project. It's unclear whether the craft, which looks like a zeppelin, is a hobby or something Brin hopes to turn into a business. "Sorry, I don't have anything to say about this topic right now," Brin wrote in an email. The people familiar with the project said Brin has long been fascinated by airships. His interest in the crafts started when Brin would visit Ames, which is located next to Google parent Alphabet's headquarters in Mountain View, California. In the 1930s, Ames was home to the USS Macon, a huge airship built by the US Navy. About three years ago, Brin decided to build one of his own after ogling old photos of the Macon. In 2015, Google unit Planetary Ventures took over the large hangars at Ames from NASA and turned them into laboratories for the company. Brin's airship, which isn't an Alphabet project, is already taking shape inside one. Engineers have constructed a metal skeleton of the craft, and it fills up much of the enormous hangar. Alan Weston, the former director of programs at NASA Ames, is leading Brin's airship project, according to the people, who asked not to be named discussing the secretive plans. Weston didn't respond to requests for comment. Weston has a background befitting such an unusual enterprise. Continued below. Related Content Michael Barnett: Transport cash options exist - let's see action Sir Douglas Myers saluted at Auckland memorial NZ net migration at new record highs, arrivals on the rise Born to Australian parents, Weston spent some of his youth in Turkey and then ended up at the University of Oxford. There he became a key member of the Dangerous Sports Club - a group of very intelligent risk-takers that formed in the early 1970s and did things such as catapult people across fields into nets. Members of the club are credited with inventing the modern form of bungee jumping. Weston, for example, performed one of the first bungee jumps by hurling himself off California's Golden Gate Bridge and then eluded the authorities waiting to capture him on shore. He also hiked Mt. Kilimanjaro in Africa and then attempted to hang-glide down, only to crash and hurt his ankle in the process. Years later, Weston joined the Air Force and did engineering work as part of the U.S. government's Strategic Defense Initiative - known more broadly as the Star Wars missile defense system. In 1989, Weston oversaw one of the first tests of Star Wars, which aimed to destroy incoming Russian missiles midair with weapons fired from space. Following his stint at the Air Force, Weston joined NASA and worked on a wide number of projects, including the development of a low-cost lunar lander. In a radio interview in 2013, Weston described plans for an airship that could be used to haul cargo. The idea is that airships could be more fuel-efficient than planes and could carry loads directly to where they're needed, rather than to transport centers like airports or shipping stations. "New airship technologies have the promise to reduce the cost of moving things per ton-mile by up to an order of magnitude," Weston said in the interview. "It depends on the size of the airship. A larger airship can reduce costs a lot more than a smaller ship, but there's design of a class of vehicles that can lift up to 500 tons that could be actually more fuel-efficient than even a truck." New airship technologies have the promise to reduce the cost of moving things per ton-mile by up to an order of magnitude. Alan Weston, former director of programs at NASA He went on to describe a prototype he was considering of a helium-based craft that appeared to breathe. "And so the way that works is that the helium in the main envelope is taken and stored in bags inside the airship at a slightly higher pressure," he said. "As you do that, air is taken in from the outside into essentially like lungs that are attached in the side of the vehicle. So the analogy of breathing is a good one. And the overall lift of the vehicle is equal to the weight of the air that is being displaced by the helium. And as you change that, you can control the amount of buoyancy that the vehicle has." This technique, according to Weston, would allow the airship to carry 500 tons without the need for a ballast. After being contacted about the airship, Weston changed his profile on LinkedIn to list his current job as chief executive officer of "Ltare." He then removed the post. There have been many attempts to build airships of this type in recent years. It's fitting for such a project to take place in Silicon Valley, which seems to have entered a steampunk phase, as people race to build things ranging from flying cars to tiny reusable rockets. Brin's airship is separate from a freight project called Calcifer that was shelved by Google X, the company's experimental research lab, in 2014. Alphabet CEO Page, Brin's Google co-founder, has funded at least two secretive flying-car projects - startups Kitty Hawk and Zee.Aero, also separate from Alphabet. Page has begun to take the wraps off one of these efforts - on Monday, Kitty Hawk released a video showing one of its all-electric vehicles taking off and soaring over a lake with the driver perched on top.

Opinion: Google should fix its erratic reminder system Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/26 2:15pm PDTApr 26, 2017 14 Plus 1 on G+ 52 Share on Facebook 46 Share on Twitter Total Shares112 Applications Editorials Google Article Contents 1 Input methods 2 Quick Access 3 Notifications 4 Allo and Home 5 Conclusion The ability to quickly set a reminder on your phone is one many of us take for granted these days. Smartphones have seemingly always had this basic PDA functionality. Type ‘add reminder’ into the Google search box and you’ll be able to quickly set up a notification to jog your memory about something later on. You can even use the ‘OK Google’ voice command: “remind me to pick up the groceries at 6pm,” for example. Easy-peasy. For most people, this function is used occasionally for something really important they simply mustn't forget. And for those people, it probably works just fine. However, for some people (like me) reminders have become an absolute necessity. I hate to admit it, but I have a really bad memory. Truly awful. For this reason, I am almost entirely dependent on Google’s system of reminders to navigate through each day. My phone will buzz with a reminder around 15 times per day. Some of these are one-offs. Some are recurring. All of them are to remind me to do something important, and without them, there’s no telling what I might forget to do. Don’t get me wrong, I am incredibly grateful that I am able to set reminders on my phone at all. But my extensive use of Google’s reminder system has also led me to conclude that it is inherently flawed. The biggest issue, as I see it, is a lack of consistency. Allow me to explain. Input methods There are currently no fewer than 6 distinct reminder input methods available to a typical Android user: Google app (including Google Assistant on compatible devices) Inbox Keep Calendar Chrome Allo Assistant With so many options, there’s always a convenient way to add a reminder to your Google account, whatever you happen to be doing when the need arises. Not all reminders are created equally, however. Add a reminder using any of the first 3 methods in the list and you’re offered the same basic options, such as when or where you’d like to be reminded and if you’d like the reminder to repeat. Inbox insists on using its ‘snooze’ terminology to denote reminder time, which isn’t ideal but we can handle that. Keep reminders are obviously linked to a specific note so you may not always want to use this option if you’d prefer your notes list to stay nice and tidy. They do still show up in your reminders list on the Google app, though, and can be dismissed from there accordingly. You cannot edit Keep reminders from within the Google app, however. To do that you’ll have hit the “Open in Google Keep” link and go through to the app itself. A Keep entry in the Google app's reminders list. If the experience already seems a little messy, it’s when you add a reminder to the Google Calendar app that things start to get weird. Firstly, these entries default to an ‘all day’ event, which seems a little counter-intuitive. It’s not difficult to change this to a timed reminder, but it's a slight annoyance that this option isn't the default. Secondly, unless you have the ‘Reminders’ box checked, which makes all of your reminders visible in your Calendar, none that you set here will actually deliver a notification. Having this option checked may not be a problem if you have one or two reminders set over the course of the week. But as I’ve already explained, I have many, many more than that. So when I set the Reminders calendar to be visible, in order to have the notifications working, my Calendar looks like this… My eyes!!! It even includes distinct entries for recurring reminders. So if you have a reminder set to recur every day it will show up in the month view for every single day, rather than just the next instance. The result is a mess. Needless to say that completely rules out Google Calendar as a method of input for me. Unfortunately, it took a couple of missed reminders when I didn’t have the option checked to figure out that the calendar functioned in this way. This was obviously frustrating, and I was lucky not to miss out on even more important notifications before I realized they weren't showing up. Another potentially handy way to set a reminder is by searching ‘add reminder’ on the Google homepage in your browser (on desktop or mobile). Regardless of browser or OS, if you’re logged into your Google account you should be able to easily set a reminder this way. Of course, there are a couple of limitations here too. First of all, there is no option to set a recurrence if you use this input method. You can revisit the entry in the Google app later on and set a recurrence there, but that kind of defeats the purpose of being able to add it in your browser in the first place. The second issue is that you can only set the reminder for predetermined times of the day. These include morning, afternoon, evening or night, as well as set times of on the hour (12:00) or half past the hour (12:30). This simply isn’t specific enough for certain tasks, and as a result, I tend to steer clear of adding reminders this way (except in an emergency), preferring the other more feature-rich methods. Quick Access At the moment there isn’t an especially fast way to enter a reminder input from your Android phone’s launcher. The ‘OK Google’ hotword (or Google Assistant on compatible devices) is easily the fastest method currently available, but there are still many of us who don't wish to talk loudly at our phones in public. Or even in private, for that matter. It's also worth mentioning that if you use the voice method this can often lead to misunderstandings or having to type extra information anyway. The Screen Search reminder button - simply not fast enough. The easiest solution would seemingly be to have a one-tap option to go straight into a reminder from your device homescreen. Instead, we have to long-press of the home button (on non-Assistant devices) which brings up Screen Search (previously Now on Tap) and click the pink Reminder button, or we can type ‘Add reminder’ into the search bar or Google app. Both of these routes often feel painfully slow. We do have app shortcuts for Calendar and Keep, which is great. But each app comes with its own feature limitations, discussed earlier, which preclude me from considering either as a viable option. If only the Google app has an "Add reminder" app shortcut or widget, the process would be a breeze. App shortcuts - why can't the Google app copy this approach? If you want to view and manage your reminders list there are several ways to do so. The Google app has a reminders list in the menu, and this is probably the most complete, robust way to manage them. Inbox displays them as pinned items in among your emails, or you can filter out everything else and view them in their own list, which functions similar to the list in the Google app. You can also snooze these in Inbox just as you can with emails. Keep has a section showing any notes that have reminders set against them, but doesn’t concern itself with any reminders not attached to one of its own notes. Lastly, Calendar (as you can see in the image further up) displays every single upcoming reminder alongside all of your other events, rendering it practically unusable. Notifications More examples of inconsistencies across these apps can be found in the notification shade. How each reminder is displayed and the quick actions associated with each vary widely. To dismiss this I must mark all 8 as ‘Finished’, including two I can't even see. When you have multiple Google app reminders they are bundled together in a single notification, rather than separated out into individual items. The only action you can perform is to mark all as ‘Finished’, dismissing every one of them at once. Another thing to remember is that notifications in Nougat only show up to 6 lines of content per app at any one time. So, in the example above there are two reminders I can’t even view without entering into the app. When you do enter into the app to mark individual items complete, that dismisses the notification from the shade entirely. If you were hoping to leave it there for the rest of the day as a glanceable to do list, you’re out of luck. Calendar reminder notifications similarly give you only the option to mark as done, but where they improve over the Google app is that you can tap into each individually and edit the reminder time on the next screen. This won’t affect the other notifications from the app. Inbox notifications are bundled rather more usefully, with each being individually expandable and giving the option to either mark as ‘Done’ or to ‘Snooze’. This offers you greater control over your tasks. While this is much closer to how it should be done, Keep refines this even further. Its notifications are also unbundled and come with two individual actions to choose from, snooze for an hour or snooze for even later. Swipe away the notification and you dismiss the reminder altogether, condemning it to the ‘Past’ section of the reminders list in the Google app. The exception being recurring reminders, which will still come back the next time they are set to recur. This is arguably the best way to handle reminder notifications, but you have to be happy to clog up your Keep list with reminders in order to utilize this. Keep's reminder notification - best in class. Your Google Now feed is yet another place you can interact with your reminder notifications. There, it’s possible to snooze reminders for an hour or mark as finished. But there seems to be little rhyme nor reason to how long reminder cards remain actionable in Google Now. It’s not uncommon for me to see a notification in Google Now long after I’ve dismissed it elsewhere, and vice versa. While the cards remain useful in some instances, this isn't a reliable way to manage your task list. Allo and Home Some of you may have noticed that I haven’t mentioned how the Google Assistant in Allo handles reminders. That’s because for some reason these reminders are kept completely separate from all those discussed above. They won’t appear in any of the other apps and can only be viewed in the Allo app when it notifies you. The notification is displayed as a message from the Assistant itself and it doesn’t appear as though you can snooze it at all, not even if you ask really nicely. Allo isn’t the only way to interact with the Google Assistant, of course, the other being Google Home. You might think that reminders would be a key function of the smart home device, but curiously you still can’t ask Home to remind you of something, months after its release. Even the addition of multi-user support hasn't yet brought with it the ability to add reminders. Much has been written about Home and Assistant still feeling like beta products. With omissions like this, it’s hard to disagree with that. Conclusion By experimenting with Google’s reminder system across all of these apps and interfaces, it’s probably possible to eventually find a way to make it work for you. I would argue that you shouldn’t have to work quite so hard to utilize what is in essence quite a basic service. I’ve tried countless other Android apps in a bid to satisfy my reminder needs, and effectively replace my defective memory. But nothing seems to hit the right balance of good design, usability, and features. Plus, there’s no substitute for being able to easily access my reminders from any device on which I can access my Google account, something Google’s reminder system still boasts over every other option on the Play Store. Still, there has to be a way to merge all of these separate interfaces and functions into a less frustrating experience. I'm sure this isn't a huge priority at Google, but I can dream, can't I? A discrete Google Reminders app would seem an obvious solution. One that plugs into the other Google services but ultimately acts as a standalone master-app might be the best way to alleviate some of these shortcomings and offer the experience I expect from a service like this. Then again, maybe it’s just me. Maybe I’m the only person who uses reminders to quite this extent and I should, in fact, seek help. Hopefully, that’s not the case. And hopefully someone at Google uses reminders just as much as I do, and with just as much frustration. Tags allo calendar google app google assistant google home inbox keep subscribe ...

Anything I set using voice is getting marked as done within 10 minutes of them notifying me. At first I thought I was crazy, I was seeing reminders in my Inbox that I had set while driving, but an hour later I'd say to myself "Wait didn't I set a reminder to do X?", only to find I HAD created the reminder, but it was marked as done. I can't figure it out! I opened a ticket with Google only to have some rep tell me I needed to clear my cache, but it still happens even when all my devices are off and browsers closed. Kevin Luther Yup. They have been really messed up. I keep finding them marked as done when j never even got the notice Simon Levin Yes that happens to me all the time. I've come to not rely on reminders for anything serious. catalysto I regularly encounter quirks like this with Google reminders. It's for this reason (and all the other stuff Scott said) that I only ever interact with them via Inbox. Fortunately, I enjoy using Inbox, so using that method is relatively painless for me, but for those who don't... Well hopefully the nightmare ends soon. A centralized reminder database/app seems to be the best solution. ShahinTr I just use events. I never bother using reminder, it's an absolute waste of time and space on calendar. Charles222 I've largely abandoned reminders in favor of calendar events and todoist. Todoist in particular, since it has equally-favored apps for the three OS's I use and Home support. David Ruddock Todoist seems very robust. I always consider trying it, then just don't because most of my reminding comes from calendar events, as you say. I want the solution to feel as integrated as possible. Scott Scrivens I have tried Todoist but I didn't like it. I don't actually remember why though...maybe I'll give it another shot. Waveblade Second on Todoist, just replacing it outright is better and the interface is way better than any other ones I've used. The other thing is context awareness is great. "Send email today at 4PM #" will figure out where it all goes. That is the killer feature about it wheelingdad If you need to set 15 reminders a day then you might look inward instead of trying to create/change a system that fits your issue. Just saying... Scott Scrivens pls halp Bruce Wayne Exactly. 15 reminders in a day is just absurd. I saw one of his screenshots and there was a reminder to "charge his phone". That says it all. Matt That calendar is what Leonard from Memento would have if they made that movie today. XerBlade Everything was just peachy for me using Inbox's reminder tools for all of this... until recently. For the last couple weeks, Google has made an incredibly asinine change where time-based notifications will automatically be marked as Done in just under an hour if you don't do it yourself. Which really mucks things up when you're, what's a simple example that's easy to convey... Say you set a reminder a while back that you forgot about (which is pretty much why you set a reminder in the first place), and it goes off while you're in a movie (and you didn't adjust it to go off later on after you're back from the movie beforehand because, you know, you don't have eidetic memory which is why you need reminders in the first place). Said reminder goes away on its own before the movie ends, so you never actually see it. That kind of BS has been happening to me DAILY since this started. [Notifications you just leave sitting in your inbox forever and never "Snooze" are fine though. Yay.] Kevin Luther I have been missing so many reminders lately as well. It's utter garbage destinyhud Here is what i do. I use google app to set all reminders. it will flow to calendar and keep is just for note taking. Now i set calendar events for more important thing to be reminder me a second time just to be be careful like my monthly mortgage Scott Scrivens This is essentially what I do currently. I wish it just worked from everywhere though. blahmoomoo Allo's subscriptions are kind of broken anyway, though I don't know if that also applies to recurring reminders. I told Allo to tell me the weather every morning, but if you don't chat with the bot on occasion, it stops doing that after about a week. Then I forget that it was supposed to remind me about the weather for a few days after each time that happened. So I have ultimately given up on it. EDIT: to be clear, the subscription is still there. It just forgets to keep sending it after a while if you don't talk to the bot, intentionally or not. 4Ui812 Google needs to fix more than just the reminder system. This is probably the least of their problems. Grey They should also bring Reminders to Gmail. Why is it Inbox-only? The other Inbox feature, Email Reminders, should be baked into the next version of Google. After that, what makes Inbox different? Jason Bell The biggest issue I've been having is that reminders don't always give me a real notification. It's always there in the Google App when I open it, but sometimes there's no notification. sam1331 I was just looking into this today. I've become increasingly dependent on reminders, and basically use it as my to do list these days. However, it definitely could be improved. The thing about the notifications is huge, if I have multiple pop up I have to click on the notification to dismiss one, and then the others are no longer sitting there in my notifications. Then I have to reschedule them to get them to sit there again, which is the whole point of the entire system. If they disappear from my notification shade, how will I remember to do them? I might as well not even use Google's reminder system at all then. It's just so convenient to type "remind me to..." in the search box and have it add whatever it is. MisterAlex I recently got a reminder notification for a "when I get home" reminder that I'd set over a year ago. No freakin' clue what made this particular arrival at home special enough to trigger it again... :v Jen Once they get all THIS stuff straightened out, I'd love the ability to set reminders by Time AND Location. For example, I'd love to say "Remind me to do laundry when I get home tonight" while I'm still at home in the morning... Right now, that would just "remind" me immediately since I'm still at home, or if I set it to a specific time, it might remind me before I get home in the evening or after I've been home a while. It'd also be useful for locations that have open/close times, like stores, where a location-only reminder won't be helpful if you frequently walk by at a time when it's closed. Having a Time + Location context would be immensely helpful! N8SLC This works for me. I use the assistant mostly. Scott Scrivens This. This would be so useful. PHLAK I also rely on reminders heavily. Hover, I limit myself to just using them through Inbox (both on the web and phone) to avoid all this complication. A stand-alone reminders app to "unify" reminder functionality would be awesome. Crossstick You & me Scott. I'm on a 12 person sales team plus a manager. NO ONE, but me uses automated reminders. I can't live without 'em. Ever since the original Palm Pilot ! Keep is my main workhorse for the past couple of years. Alex Renna This is the reason I switched to using a To-Do app (Todoist). There used to be a Gmail add-in (#todo) that stopped development after Google implemented Reminders on Calendar, and acted like you stated, only one occurrence that would move days until it was completed. If that made a come back I would be a happy man. kimbo I haven't had to make any reminders recently but I thankfully haven't experienced these issues before Cakefish I use Keep reminders a few times a month for important stuff like meetings and deadlines. Dozens of reminders a day? I wouldn't want to be that dependant on technology to function properly in everyday life. I can usually remember the mundane everyday stuff pretty well on my own, such as remembering to buy food and eat it, drink to keep myself hydrated, charge my phone when the battery gets low, go to the toilet, breathe in and out etc. Everyone's different though! Each to their own. Shakil Shaikh Jut install Tasks, the app formally known as Astrid: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.tasks Workflow wise, resizable/fiterable widgets do it for me (they also provide a quick way to enter a categorised task). Persistent notifications help in some cases too. Mostly though, it's the only to-do app that offers recurring tasks on both scheduled date (every 3rd Monday) or on completed date (3 weeks since last completed). It'd probably be quicker and healthier than waiting for Google to create some kind of compromised workflow for you instead. Scott Scrivens I was actually an avid Astrid user back in the day. Miss that little octopus. My issue with this as a solution is that I always need to use my phone. I'm looking for cross-device/platform integration. LaserWraith I tried to use Google's reminders in the past but gave up for reasons similar to yours. Todoist keeps me on track now across all my devices and it's pretty great. Some flaws still, but a big improvement. Raymond Berger Have you tried TickTick? I've been using it for years and it was been absolutely fantastic. It works across many platforms and has a relatively simple interface but also plenty of options for power users. Trip66 Been using it for years I love it...Bought it Immediately.+1 N8SLC You can de-select the reminders calendar. As for the rest, I think the sheer volume is on you. ;) Scott Scrivens You can, but then any reminder you set using Calendar won't work. Deeco PREACH AP!!! Please make more articles like these to highlight these simple anoying flaws. Let us be heard and get Google off​ their backside! ellett Why can't a reminder play a sound? As it stands now you can get an email or have a notification pop up, but everything is silent, which is useless if I'm doing something else when the reminder triggers. If I need an alarm, I have to set a reminder several hours in advance to remind me to set a phone alarm. Sophie Yes, many of these things have been bothering me, too! The state of Google's reminder system is much like their chat/messaging apps: confusing and fragmented (Ok, maybe it's not as bad as the chat/messaging apps). Like the author, I also rely on reminders (my calendar looks alot like his!). I primarily interact with them through the Google app, as well as a script I wrote for the Linux command-line that allows me to quickly add timed reminders (Google calls them quick events) to a special "My reminders" calendar (I wish I could save them to the default Reminders calendar that Calendar and the Google app seem to use, but it seems off-limits to developers). If Google's voice-to-text translation was better, I would stick to the Google app, I really don't mind talking at my phone, in public or otherwise, but it's not great. I have to correct things so often that I might as well type it in half the time (hence the command-line script). bdbplatano 🍻 Here's to hoping Google's paying attention🍻 Wolfie410 My biggest issue had to do with recurring reminders set through Google Now/Assistant. I was unable to clear a reminder ahead of schedule, without completely deleting the future occurrences of the recurring task. The only other option was to wait for the notification to pop and then dismiss it. Not very convenient. Have beem using the splendo to-do list. Rudresh Another way is to set an alarm with a note, works best for me. Lateef Alabi-Oki I wonder how hard it is to create a single reminder service, with a consistent API and behavior, that all their front-end services and third-party apps can use? Just thinking out loud here. Bruce Wayne I can't imagine why you would need a reminder to charge your phone. Trip66 Many of these shortcuts can be added to the homescreen in most launchers and especially in Nova but I use the OK Google method and several times a day. "Remind me in one hour that at 2pm so and so is coming by to.... That type of stuff... and I plan my whole day everyday so I don't forget someone is coming by or I have to be somewhere etc etc. It's a godsend to me and I can do it all hands free and 90% of the time it's in the car via BT. Awesome.ability. I fix computers all day so I'm always picking up or dropping off and also people drop and pickup to me so it reminds me when so I dont leave if someone is coming over or I have to be to their place at a specific time. But I haven't had any issues with them being marked as done or anything and they always go off at the time I say to. Viral Kacha https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5ee1efd75a870942aa10e7ecb1adcdfe05ac836338f4823d2d7a45180f970b2b.png "If only the Google app has an "Add reminder" app shortcut or widget, the process would be a breeze." Inbox app has the widget and it's quite neat and inclusive of all the features. Luzandro I also use the inbox widget, which works quite well for me, except when the shown presets for snoozing aren't appropriate (which is quite often the case for me, as the soonest suggestion is in the evening) it takes surprisingly many steps to choose something different TedPhillips yesss. the bundling gets me since if i finish one reminder but have a few overlapping (but not too many like you), need to be very aggressive but also careful about notification shade grooming. out of sight out of mind and all that. A+ Simon Levin Thank you. If only Google cared to fix their old products. Nathan J For me, reminders have always been crap on both platforms. On Android, I used an app called Lotify. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nll.lotify The nice thing about this app is that you have a ton of options, and a huge selection of icons to choose from, so if you have a lot, they stand out from one another. I expected iOS to be leaps and bounds ahead, because an iPhone just works, right? Not so fast. I found iOS lacking in that regard. Via Reddit, I found an app called "HiFutureSelf" that simulates a text message. You put in the message and the time you want to receive it. You can set a unique ringtone for the app. And when the time comes, you get your message. It suits my purposes. There might be better options, but I haven't seen any, personally. Ryan Warmack Business calendar pro hits the nail on the head for me. ilovetesla can anybody petition google to make adding birthdays and anniversaries to calendar easy Alicia Frederick Inbox has a widget you can add to the home screen on your phone for single tap quick access, which might help with the notifications since Inbox does them better. Jeremy Couch One thing that I hate is that when you dismiss Android notifications of reminders from Keep they mark it as Done. So I stopped using Keep for reminders. Very annoying. Ste Tan Excellent article. Reminders have been a pain for me as well throughout Google services. I've tried so many different apps—apps like todoist,etc— that just isn't as convenient for me compared to a native solution by Google. I eventually just went back to using Calender and keep for reminders and though it does become aggravating, I've grown to just deal with it since I need to use it daily. A Google reminders app would be perfect, especially since it would seemlessly sync and work consistently throughout all my Android devices plus any other device I have my Google account connected to. I really hope Google sees this article and takes it into consideration. Fabian Todt personally i like how google calender reminders show up, that's exactly how/why i use them: these are tasks/todos i have to do at this very moment so they are like an event/meeting. this is somehow similar to the getting things done method: i've got all tasks in todoist and plan them as reminders in calender when i have to do them. Neil S The article says that there is no widget for reminders that can be added to the home screen. I have one on my phone. The Google inbox app has a reminder set up widget which is quick to use. Just tape the reminder widget button and enter the reminder text, then hit the clock icon to set it for any time you like and to repeat if you like.

Diane Greene delivers a keynote during Google Next '17 last month. Advertisement Google is well positioned to compete and even surpass Amazon Web Services in public cloud during the next half-decade, the head of Google’s cloud division told a weekend gathering of tech leaders. The public cloud arm of tech giant Alphabet is in the midst of a rapid, multi-year expansion that included bringing on Diane Greene as senior vice president of Google Cloud in November of 2015. Related 2017 MSP 501 Worldwide List and Rankings - Enter Now! Data Sheds Light on MSP’s Favorite Vendors. During a question and answer session at the Forbes CIO Summit in Half Moon Bay on Sunday, Greene suggested the fast-growing Google Cloud Platform is poised to leapfrog competitors AWS, Microsoft Azure and IBM Cloud, all of which currently have a larger share of public cloud market.   “I think we have a pretty good shot at being No. 1 in five years,” she’s quoted as telling the group, according to an article at Forbes.com. AWS has long been the market leader in public cloud, followed by Microsoft and IBM. All of the companies are seeing dramatic growth in cloud earnings. Greene told the audience that, in many respects, the scale is tipped in Google’s favor, but acknowledged that the company must continue to execute. “I actually think we have a huge advantage in our data centers, in our infrastructure, availability, security and how we automate things,” Greene continued. “We just haven’t packaged it perfectly yet.” In March of 2016, Alphabet announced it was pouring tens of billions of dollars into Google Cloud, and expanding the number of global data centers from three to 15 by the end of 2017. Last month, Google announced it was expanding its cloud partner program, increasing investments and financial incentives, adding new technical training and certifications; and committing to the role of partners in driving adoption of its Google Cloud Platform. “Google Cloud partners are essential to our commitment to help enterprises innovate faster, scale smarter and stay secure,” company executives wrote in a March blog post announcing the expanded program. “Partners deliver significant value to our customers, and we’re committed to supporting their success.” During Sunday’s CIO Summit, Green said Google intends to use the full weight of its technological wherewithal to become the dominant player in cloud. “Google is just build for having the most technology,” Forbes quoted her as saying. “That’s what we’re good at and that’s who we’ve hired.”   Send tips and news to MSPmentorNews@Penton.com.

This means most Android apps can run on select Chromebooks as they would on any smartphone or tablet. There may be limits to some functions and features but the developers are there to make adjustments. The idea of downloading and installing Android apps on Chromebooks has been noted since last year. We’ve been waiting for Android apps to come to more Chromebooks. We also wondered where and when. We anticipated as this move will help share the future of Android. One of the first Chromebooks to receive Google Play Store support include the Chromebook Pixel 2015 and Acer R11. Google Play Store support was made ready for more Chromebooks in Beta Channel just before the year 2016 ended. For some Chromebooks, the Android Nougat OS was even made available. We know more Chrome OS-powered laptops are now ready to support the Google Play Store as Google just updated the list of Chrome OS systems that allow Android apps. The list doesn’t only include Chromebooks but also several Chromebases and Chromeboxes. Remember that not all Chromebooks will receive Android apps and Play Store support but the Chrome OS team is working hard to evaluate more models.

Close April 24, 2017 Not so long ago, someone might've looked at that headline and thought we'd lost our minds, or at least fallen asleep on the keyboard. These days, though, we're all too familiar with what each of those words means and what's at stake as two of the biggest players in the field of self-driving cars go head-to-head in the courtroom.  That courtroom drama got a little more dramatic last week, when Waymo claimed that Uber has been using its proprietary technology in secret. Ryan Murphy, if you're reading this, please consider tackling this fiasco for your next season of Feud. A quick recap In February, Google and its recently spun-off self-driving car subsidiary, Waymo, sued autonomous trucking company Otto and its parent company, Uber. They alleged that former Googler Anthony Levandowski stole a huge number of trade secrets before leaving Google, then began using those secrets Otto and, after the company was bought out, at Uber. Last we heard, Waymo and Google had a pretty convincing case. As stated in the court documents:  "We found that six weeks before his resignation this former employee, Anthony Levandowski, downloaded over 14,000 highly confidential and proprietary design files for Waymo’s various hardware systems, including designs of Waymo’s LiDAR and circuit board. To gain access to Waymo’s design server, Mr. Levandowski searched for and installed specialized software onto his company-issued laptop. Once inside, he downloaded 9.7 GB of Waymo’s highly confidential files and trade secrets, including blueprints, design files and testing documentation. Then he connected an external drive to the laptop. Mr. Levandowski then wiped and reformatted the laptop in an attempt to erase forensic fingerprints." As the kids say these days: daaaaaaamn. Oh, and just to make things really interesting, Levandowski has refused to testify in the Waymo/Google/Uber/Otto case. He's cited his Fifth Amendment rights, which prevent people from incriminating themselves in court.  Given the weight of Waymo's claims and Levandowski's reluctance to speak on behalf of his current employer, U.S. District Judge William Alsup has threatened to force Uber's self-driving car programs off the roads of Pittsburgh, San Francisco, and Tempe until the matter is formally resolved. However Uber has countered that Waymo's claims are irrelevant because Uber isn't using any of the technology that Levandowski allegedly stole.  That's not the same as saying that Levandowski didn't steal it, mind you. It's simply stating that Uber is employing other technology.  So far, Alsup has bought Uber's claim and allowed the company's self-driving car program to continue.  Is Uber telling the truth? But of course, this wouldn't be a story about Uber if things were as simple as they seemed. You might want to start taking notes: it gets a little complicated.  Uber admits that it is developing its own self-driving system, which is code-named Fuji. However, the company also states that: 1. Fuji isn't yet ready for prime-time, so Uber is currently using autonomous car technology developed by Velodyne.  2. Even when it's complete, Fuji will differ dramatically from Waymo's system. Fuji relies on multi-lens LiDAR, while Waymo's technology makes use of single-lens LiDAR. In schoolyard lingo, Uber is saying, "Even if we were using Waymo's stuff--which we totally aren't--it wouldn't be Waymo's stuff because it's different." But at least one Uber employee with intimate knowledge of the subject say that that's not entirely true.

Lovehacker: My Girlfriend Just Died. When Can I Start Dating Again? Harris O'Malley 27 Apr 2017 1:30 PM Dear Lovehacker, I have what may be an impossible question to answer. For lack of better phrasing, I've been a non-participant in dating since university. I've always had an excuse not to do it, ranging from preferring to concentrate on my studies to not having my own place. The timing just never seemed right. Flash-forward to roughly two months ago. I finally agreed to go on a date with a friend/coworker who'd shown interest in me. We were both nerds, had some common interests and things were going really well. Unfortunately, the relationship ended in the worst possible fashion. She died unexpectedly last month from complications from her prescriptions. Want Lifehacker's email newsletter?

Liliputing spotted a new product that recently passed through the Federal Communication Commission: a pair of Google-branded, over-ear headphones with active noise-canceling, a built-in microphone, and Micro USB charging. There were even images that showed the headphones, which have the model number GID5B and also include a traditional audio cable, with Google's trademark colours surrounding the power button. Google may release three Pixel devices this year Google teams up with Yi to launch new Jump VR camera rig for pros Everybody assumed that meant Google had secretly developed new wireless hardware for consumers, or at the very least, it made some swag gear for its upcoming Google I/O event in May. But, at the same time, they looked a little boring, and so it wasn't long before reports came out that dashed all our hopes. Android Police noted the headphones are probably an upgrade to existing headphones that Google gives to its employees. Google So, good for them, but boo for us. We've contacted Google for a comment and will keep you posted as we learn more.

The latest update coming through the beta channel doesn't seem to have any new features going live quite yet, but there are a lot of changes to text and other resources, including the removal of all references to Bisto from the last teardown. Most of them are minor tweaks to features we've covered in the past, but a couple point to things we haven't explored yet. Users can look forward to pollen counts with their local weather and possibly a search bar located right in the notification shade. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. Search bar in the notification panel It looks like Google is testing a new location for the quick search bar. A new setting in the apk describes placing a "search bar in the notification panel." The setting doesn't appear to be live yet, even on the Android O developer preview, which isn't surprising since it's marked as a beta. Before you assume this is going to be just another quick access tile like the toggles for Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, let's be clear that the phrasing specifically says the search bar is in the notification panel and the word "tile" is never used. It could be worded incorrectly, which sometimes happens with unofficial features, but this sounds too specific to be a mistake. code <string name="search_notification_setting_title">Search bar (beta)</string> <string name="search_notification_setting_summary">Show quick search bar in the notification panel</string> <string name="accessibility_notification_google_search_button">Google Search</string> <string name="accessibility_notification_settings_button">Notification Settings</string> <string name="accessibility_notification_voice_search_button">Voice Search</string> res/xml/search_notification_preferences.xml <PreferenceScreen xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"> <SwitchPreference android:persistent="true" android:title="@string/search_notification_setting_title" android:key="persistent_search_notification_enabled" android:summary="@string/search_notification_setting_summary" android:defaultValue="false" /> </PreferenceScreen> Since the Android OS only allows very limited access to the UI of a notification, this probably won't be implemented as a regular notification. Contrary to the point I made above, it obviously still could be a simple quick tile that displays a search bar floating on top of whatever screen you're currently looking at. I'm going to venture another theory or two, although I admit this is crossing deeper into guesswork. This clue might suggest Google is planning to modify the notification panel itself to include a space for the search bar, possibly inserting it between the quick settings tiles and the actual notifications. I'm not sure many people would want a search bar in that spot, but it's not implausible. We can take that theory one step further, probably crossing into the realm of the unlikely, to raise the possibility Google could be planning to open up the notification panel to app developers even further and allow full-width widgets to be placed there. There are certain things that can't be done with either quick settings the tiles or regular notifications, so there is at least some justification for adding this capability, but it still feels unlikely. We might find out more about this as Android O gets closer to launch. Regardless of the specific implementation method, we can return to the original question of whether or not most users would want a search bar in the notification panel. Would it be redundant if there could already be a search bar on their launcher and long-pressing on the Home button can open up Assistant, or would this just give us another option if those don't fit our workflow? Since it's a beta, we may not get much more about this for a while. Pollen counts In my neck of the woods, as with the rest of the northern hemisphere, we're in the middle of Spring. That means we're enjoying warmer temperatures, sunnier skies, and longer days. For some, it's also time for unending fits of sneezing, itchy eyes, and all of the symptoms of hay fever. I don't personally suffer from this, but plenty of people do, and keeping tabs on the pollen count can be helpful for making plans to keep the allergies in check. Judging by a new image in the Google app, this information is about to get a little more visible. Titled ic_pollen_count.png, it's pretty clear what this flower image (that looks like it's sweating) will be used for. I expect it to show up with the standard weather predictions, much like it does on some other trackers and news outlets. It's a simple feature, but one that will surely be invaluable to millions of users around the world. Seeing as we're already in the middle of Spring, there's no better time for this information to go live, and probably could at any time. Hopefully it's sooner rather than later.

Filipe Santos GOOGLE, I DON'T CARE, just give me Assistant on my 6P!!! Frisi I think you should have it. Most phones have it by now. Sam I still don't have it, either :( Yash Raj Chhabra Change language to english us. Give ur phone a restart and you should have assistant. Vratislav Jindra Be glad you don't have it, Assistant sucks (at least when compared to Google Now). It can't identify songs. It broke AutoVoice (a Tasker plugin) integration. You can't type to it, you always have to speak. Long pressing home button always comes up with the assistant screen, and there is no shortcut to go to the Google App itself. I just hate it, that's all. Cody Toombs The AutoVoice plugin can kinda already be solved with IFTTT for some actions, but doesn't really give the full range of capabilities. I think that's going to get better once some of the other features for Assistant are opened up. As for speaking your input, that's already in the works. It was mentioned in a previous teardown, and I'm a bit surprised it hasn't gone live yet. (link) Tim Lewis For quickly accessing Google Now (which I use to get a quick run-down on the news), I use Action Launcher and just have a shortcut set to open the Google app when I tap the home button when I'm already on the home screen. mattcoz Yes, I hate that you can't type. I don't want to talk to my phone, especially in public. Fernando Pena I have it already... 6p, developer preview, english language. demarcmj Forgot to finish that last sentence...

Good catch! Trooper311 Thanks for the write up Cody. I have noticed something of late with the Google app. I thought it was because I was on beta, but I got off of beta and it still does the same thing on my Pixel XL. Also on my wife's Moto X. For the weather cards, instead of saying the town that I am in, it states the township that I am in. This travels with me wherever I am. Home, work, a store etc. Any news on this by chance? Thanks. Cody Toombs I live in a place that barely exists, so I've always been bumped into neighboring areas. For that reason, I never really notice when things like that behave abnormally. Sorry. Trooper311 It's ok man. Appreciate you hitting me back. Cheers. CasperTFG #oceans11 Carson Saldanha Search bar in the notification panel seems pretty legit to me. DragoCubed Full-width widgets in the notification bar? Yes please. Search bar in the notification bar? Not so exciting Dennis Ulijn Can the search bar in the notification panel not be a reply line, like you get in messaging apps like hangouts, messages and whatsapp? Bombaglad i imagine that could be pretty easy to implement it that way for any 3rd party dev as a separate app (please correct me if i am wrong) Multiling O Keyboard Yes, I'm thinking to add app shortcuts to it with my Renegade Launcher app. ilovetesla whats the use of a pollen counter?? Cody Toombs "Pollen counts are measured from low, meaning they affect few individuals, to high, meaning symptoms affect most allergy sufferers." source ilovetesla but, a phone counting "pollen" WTF is this tech man Sup Are you being serious right now? Red No, he's being serious next Thursday. Quint’s Sharking & Seashells Busy on Thursday, how about Friday? Cody Toombs Is this is a serious misunderstanding or are you trolling? The actual data collection happens at a facility that monitors pollen counts, and the results are then sent out for people to see on their phones. Derek Ross Pixel 2 will come with pollen sensors. You heard it here first. ilovetesla ohhhh ... OK .i thought there will be some kind of sensor in future android devices that measures pollen things dammit !!!! i'm bad Cody Toombs lol, it's cool. We all do it from time to time :) Quint’s Sharking & Seashells I know, its bad enough that a phone can tell you how much rain we get. I don't want my phone getting wet. This is nonsense and i'm talking out of my ass. Quint’s Sharking & Seashells Sorry, a little off topic, but do any of you have an issue where the weather icons do not show up in the Google Now widget? Peacen1k Been an issue over several versions, so for quite some time now. Also, only 2 rows of tiles show up, the rest of the widget space is empty. Kawshik Ahmed Maybe it will be something like this. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9abe1606e0efd2996cb434a33131a56a45a2a60b329ed1a4cec68331a778fafb.jpg 9+10=21 Nice jodieisme Thursday, July 28th..?🙈 Oasis Feng I guess the search bar in notification panel will be a normal notification with quick reply functionality as input field for quick search. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Time to start moving things to the bottom of the UI Google. #WebOs David Hyman I would be happy if it was implemented like how Textra handles the quick SMS notification. You hit the notification and the search widget appears as an overlay on top of everything else. They already have this overlay created too so it would be quick to implement in my opinion Ben Roberts I downloaded the apk but I don't see any search in the notifications Cody Toombs This is a teardown. Note the big disclaimer at the top and regular use of future tense as the feature is described. Captain_Invisible That means you have to read more than the title... Gonzales I see the search bar in the feed but not in the pull down notification, which is where I would like it. Rami I would like the search bar there, or back in overview. There's no way to easily open Google from Assistant without multiple taps, and my home screen setup has no room for a search bar.

[Update: Just headphones for employees] Google-branded wireless headphones show up at the FCC Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/26 10:28am PDTApr 26, 2017 82 Plus 1 on G+ 136 Share on Facebook 111 Share on Twitter Total Shares329 Google News Update 1: 2017/04/26 10:30am PDT An anonymous tipster has shed some light on what these almost certainly are. Google issues headphones to a large number of its employees, and the current model is getting quite Well this is... unexpected. We've heard whispers of a new Google Home/Google WiFi combo, and even the next Pixel devices, but nothing in the realm of audio products. Out of nowhere, a set of headphones from Google have appeared in a new FCC filing. The headphones, which are identified as 'GID5B,' are definitely a bit odd. One side has a power button, and the other a simple Google logo, both in a circle matching Google's logo colors. According to the documents, these headphones support Bluetooth connectivity - but there doesn't appear to be any mention of a microphone. As with many wireless headphones, there is an AUX connector if you don't want to mess with Bluetooth. Strangely, there is a microUSB port for charging - not USB Type-C. According to the user manual included in the FCC filing, GID5B has a 600mAh battery. It's very possible that this was filed to get clearance on the internal radio, which could later be included on a different pair of headphones. The microUSB port, lack of microphone functionality, and no Google Assistant features seems to back up this claim. It would be a bit strange for Google to release headphones without any unique functionality, using an old port. Update 1: 2017/04/26 10:30am PDT An anonymous tipster has shed some light on what these almost certainly are. Google issues headphones to a large number of its employees, and the current model is getting quite long in the tooth. We've got a picture of it below. As you can see, it bears the same power button iconography as the ones in the FCC filing above. These headphones are distributed for use only inside Google and are not sold anywhere - they're just for Googlers. This new ANC Bluetooth version is just an update on the design, probably meant to replace these older headsets as they're phased out. So, no: Google is not releasing a really ugly wireless headphone with a microUSB port and no microphone. Well, not to anyone except Googlers.

Not Google's... #facepalm FRGuzman That's actually Google's official merchandise store. Admittedly, it does look fake. It's run by a third party company that has the license to produce merchandise with G's logo, though. MJ How do we know this? Source? Why would Google use like a 3rd rate company for this? Anyone have a link from Google's website to that site? Gobelet The SSL certificate was delivered by Google themselves. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2ec49ef6e0020e3a0c8436a7f6610146bd0e573f443b2d220fc2a5baf5ed48be.png MJ Well played sir... Best proof after a half dozen comments. Again, why have a third rate looking store site that looks like crap/fake? FRGuzman I did some research on it a couple of months ago as I was looking for a Google decal and stumbled upon this website and it looked kinda shady to me too. I can't recall all the evidence I gathered but I ended up convinced it was legit. I'd say Google doesn't care too much about branded merchandising and they off loaded it to a third party company that in my opinion doesn't even offer compeling or quality looking goods. Shagnscooby Weird. I knew they had a merch store but I certainly didn't think there was electronics there that weren't on the store.google.com They must not make or design the merch ones and it's just a logo slapped on. MJ They don't... It's a fake store. Shagnscooby It's not fake. I've done telephone survey's for Google and one of the payment options was a Google Merch store gift card instead of other gift cards. MJ Google does telephone surveys? Who even answers telephone surveys or picks up on unrecognized numbers? mog386 Wrong. It's legit. Lol. You dolt.

MJ Really? You had go with the name calling? I don't care what the fucking website says... It doesn't look legit at all. Even if they have the rights to slap the Google logo on shit they aren't Google's products. The OP was wrong about the headphones. Aaron Berlin I'm guessing those are just white label goods with Google branding on them, so GOOG wouldn't actually file with the FCC. Maybe??? MJ It's not official merchandise!

David Ruddock I'm sorry, but not even close. MJ LOL I beat you to it David. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I mean they are both headphones... Dan Proctor Mentioned it above but my comment was aimed at these going into their merchandise store vs a real consumer product. My company offers the same generic branded things that go through the FCC as our own products. Very common among the bigger companies of the world. David Ruddock They could, but seeing as we've never seen any headphones go through under Google's name before, I have my doubts. Dan Proctor As in these look like they will be going into this store. Same as other people have said about them being the generic items Google offers at events and to employees. David Mendívil if this thing has an internal FM radio receiver (analog), I will get one Sashank Narayan What mainstream headphones even have that capability? Justin W I can answer this: none. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And why? FM radio still exists? David Mendívil dude, not everyone lives in EEUU or EUROPE, most of the human population still hears analogical radio stations Matt It's not just a Europe thing. I live in the US and I have not listened to FM radio in years. Erstam Same. I despise analog radio. Do many commercials plus it usually sounds like crap. DanSan I don't even know where the FM radio button is in my car. /s yes i do but you get the point. David Mendívil Sorry EEUU is USA in Spanish hehe but at least in south america, it is quite common to still have the good old FM radio stations, having a data plan is still too expensive Matt Oh, right. I even know that. I think having it right next to EUROPE my brain just combined it all. podme Probably giveaways to employees and swag for events, etc Jarrett Lennon Kaufman They'd be better off rebranding OEM headphones for just that, though, and could skip this process. Mordalo I'm more concerned about the sound quality. If they sound good and don't break my bank account (or my mortgage payment), I'd be happy to get another set of good Bluetooth cans. They don't need to be always on or listening (even though this is Google). mlm5em Sees Headline: Must buy immediately Sees Mirco USB: Run away T4rd What wireless headphones (or any phone/PC accessories) have USB-C ports yet? Erstam My phone is usb c. My Chromebook only had usb c. I have a mouse and keyboard that are usb c. My battery pack is usb c. Come to the future brother. It's great!. I use the same cable to charge everything normally too. I actually had the same thought as the guy above. I'm not buying anything that's not usb c any more. It's not future proof and i rarely have to carry a non c cable anymore (except on a trip i bring an extra micro usb for my gf s7). T4rd So your mouse and keyboard.. that's pretty much it. I agree, I would only like to buy USB C accessories as well, but it seems they're not picking it up any time soon still. catalysto So you're being purposefully obtuse. T4rd Likewise. catalysto That's a yes. T4rd For you.

I was looking for one to replace my MAX Anywhere 2. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Lol. This is ridiculously ugly T4rd Headphones with Cast built in..? Could be cool. marcusmarcus2 That is the first thing I thought when I read the headline makapav That would be a pretty good idea - as long as it also has a mic for calls and gives the option for filtering in ambient sound/noise when needed. Rinkesh621 How about cast and miniature Google home, so you can order pizza, while you stream your music from your Spotify while you watch e-sport games with Picture in Picture of watching old Charlie Chaplin silent film? No.... just a though. lol SpeakethTheTruth Sounds like a Pimp My Ride episode. Lateef Alabi-Oki 600mAh battery for a headphone? What are they aiming for? A week long battery life. Jay I'd probably buy them because Google. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ 4Ui812 They'll probably have issues out of the box because .... Google ¯_(ツ)_/ Mohamed Fixaal And they'll later release 10 new headphones and change their names later in because Google.. ¯_(ツ)_/ David’s Flattop Reigns Supreme Wow, Its a trifecta of wisdom!! Diego Opazo SV-Cross ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ After that they'll release a companion app ecosystem only to abandon them altogether because ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Ray And then one model will shut down randomly with 35% battery still remaining. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ David’s Flattop Reigns Supreme even more helpful.... Nexus✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Guess I've gotten mostly lucky, my two galaxy nexus, nexus 4, 5, 7, google home, chromecasts, nexus player, and pixel didn't have problems out of the box. my 5x developed crazy slowness over time rendering it barely useful (and I've flashed all sorts of roms and formatted storage and disabled encryption). Nigel Antonio im right there with you, but ad a nexus 1. and a Pixel to the mix. Dennis Lockhart Maybe but they'll be in 'beta' so a fix is just down the road a bit. ;-) 4Ui812 LOL Andrey Simakov They are Google because Google. David’s Flattop Reigns Supreme Well that was helpfull Glen Barrington Then they'll abandon the whole thing because Google.. ¯_(ツ)_/ John Marshall’s Ghost Why isn't this USB C? I have a Pixel XL and my wife has the Nexus 5X. We have switched our lives over to USB C. Why would I want to carry around another cable or an adapter just for a set of headphones? I have not been able to find a set of USB C wireless headphones and for the life of me, I can't understand why. vmxr ugly Cael That G looks like a Q to mean. Clearly the Nexus Q2 /s Thomas Larsen It's a power button Cael I was being sarcastic... Thomas Larsen I know, even without the /s makiller The manual showing an aux cable included reinforces for me that Google will keep the headphone jack on the next Pixel again. I doubt they'd include an aux cord with their new branded headphones if their new branded phone couldn't even use it..... right? These are kind of ugly though. ITGuy11 Right. Cause your going to need that headphone jack due to Pixel 2 Bluetooth issues ¯_(ツ)_/¯ JG Counter point... That assumes everyone at Google will be using the Pixel 2. I would imagine some (especially those developing for iOS) use iPhones. And several probably carry around Galaxy devices etc... You don't have to eat McDonalds for every meal just because you work there... You're also further assuming the aux cord is to be plugged into the phone. Maybe the aux port is included so the headphones can connect to the employee's computer terminal. Or maybe the equipment in the campus gym, like at my gym, lack bluetooth and need a wired connection in order to listen to the built in TV/music player. Or since Google will only need a small quantity I would imagine it would probably have been easier and cheaper just to use parts already in production rather than asking whoever is actually building them to create custom hardware for a relatively small order. That would also explain why the charge port is microUSB and not USB-C. DanSan just curious, is there a reason why you'd expect a microphone for these? I'm just guessing here but these don't look like gaming or professional use headphones which would be the only time they might require a mic. This looks more like trying to capture the hype of other products like beats. No idea but do beats have a built in mic? I get it, maybe it would be good for assistant if it had a mic but not sure i see lack of microphone a drawback, especially when similar headphones dont have them matteventu For... Calls? DanSan do other headphones that look or fit in this same category have the same functionality? i only ask because the article is written as if not having a mic is a knock against the product yet i dont think anything else in this space has a mic. Miku is Best Vocaloid Most of them do. matteventu Aurevoir 3.5mm jack on Pixel 2. Damnit. Fr0gg0 It's not like anyone outside Google would want to wear those. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Never underestimate the power of branding. sebastianer Yeah....for less than 150€ you can get some AKG K701s headphones.(that you can mod if you need more Low frequency). And for 100 USD you can get a Schiit Fulla 2 amazing DAC and reasonable good amp. That's all you need for a decent audio quality nowadays. Tom Harman Yes Please! Jeffrey Spiers I'll be scouring Ebay for these... icyhotmike Supported for 3 months and then left dry to die a slow and unfixed death -Every Google product KRS_Won Google Listen™ Built with Cast® I'd prob buy em. Rinkesh621 Those earmuff bezels tho ! Complimentary with Pixel 2? Alfonso Surroca It's a shame this headset is internal-only. A Google headset such as this would fit nicely with their consumer product mix, especially if it only worked in conjunction with all-new dedicated messaging and voice apps. G Suite Headset Messenger by Google has a nice ring to it. Rod Moore What is this AUX you speak of? All of Goggles phones have USB-C ports. Plus the Chromebooks are coming out with USB-C. Very odd to be using a older USB auxiliary port. hzd Bluetooth Google headphones . . . Haha expect less work to get done at Google from here on in, Google's relationship with any BT is always Rocky !

What we’re doing today is taking a tip we’ve received with a giant grain of salt. Massive, I’m telling you – you might end up feeling better about this if you take TWO grains of salt with it. Thanks to a bit of code in an Android code commit, we’re able to see that at least one Google engineer has access to an actual, physical Pixel 2 – or whatever it’ll end up being called. Below you’ll see a bit of circumstantial evidence, as it were. Code commits in AOSP Gerrit action means very little, quite often. Comments like these don’t necessarily a physical Pixel make. But they’re pretty compelling. One of three new device is mentioned here – that’ll be the Pixel 2, the most basic of three devices, codename Walleye. See the rest over here, checking Muskie and Taimen. See how we name-checked the next Qualcomm processor (sort of) in another code turnover in our feature Pixel 2 processor devil’s in the details. That information comes from the same source as the bits and pieces we have today. The Pixel, Pixel XL, and Pixel XXL – or whatever you want to call them – are being called out by Google in code where only the most hardcore Android lovers will find them. It is possible that Google would test very early versions of hardware with software that’ll eventually run on final hardware builds. It’s also possible that the mention of a manual test on a physical device could just mean that another Nexus or Pixel device is running a mockup of the software conditions in which the most basic Pixel will run. The simplest explanation of what’s going on here is that Google already has a Pixel 2 – in some form – for basic future Android code testing. If that’s true, and if Google plans on releasing the Pixel 2 exactly one year after the original, Google is putting in the time – lots of it – doing tests and optimizing the second generation of Pixel hardware. Getting hardware this early tips the idea Google likely changed very little in how they’re manufacturing the device. It also suggests that HTC is probably once again behind the wheel. Expect to see some bits and pieces of code at Google I/O 2017 – but probably not the devices themselves. The conference takes place on May 17th, 18th, and 19th, 2017. Stick around our Android hub to see the whole thing, start to finish.

And it's all thanks a combination of user stupidity, and the ad giant failing to spot and remove the software nasty lurking in its application souk. The rogue code – dubbed Falseguide because it is contained within game walkthrough applications – has been spreading fast, in part because of poor app checking by Google. According to infosec vendor Check Point, some of these apps have been hiding in plain view in the Google Play store since November of last year, and their malicious nature wasn't picked up by the Chocolate Factory. "Mobile botnets are a growing trend since early last year, growing in both sophistication and reach," Check Point said in an advisory that lists the dodgy apps – all of which have belatedly been removed from the Play Store. "This type of malware manages to infiltrate Google Play due to the non-malicious nature of the first component, which only downloads the actual harmful code. Users shouldn't rely on the app stores for their protection." These apps may have been able to slip past Google's malware radars by appearing to be innocent programs and later smuggle malicious code onto the devices. Rather than bundling ad-slinging code and spyware into the app, the software's masterminds use Google's Firebase SDK to access an online discussion board, which is used to control the tw-million-strong army. Messages containing URLs to additional modules are posted to the forum, which the apps read and obey by installing the linked code. So far the only nasties Falseguide downloads and executes just display annoying adverts on handsets, but future modules could, for example, install spyware on the devices, or be used to launch denial-of-service attacks on victims. This is all possible thanks to the level of access the apps ask for when first installed: the software pops up a permission request screen telling users that it wants full device admin rights. Obviously this should set alarm bells ringing – a game guide is no more than a collection of pictures and text, and there's no reason for it to have such access rights. But, people being people, around two million idiots have ignored this red flag waved by someone in a scarlet leotard and ruby slippers screaming "red flag, red flag" – and tapped OK. The source of the malware is unknown, but the apps were uploaded by two developers named Sergei Vernik and Nikolai Zalupkin. These are highly likely to be fake accounts, but Russia is churning out some quality malware these days, as many people are finding out to their cost.

PRI.org <iframe frameborder="0"  src="https://www.pri.org/node/161681/embedded" height="75" width="100%"></iframe> The 31-year-old software engineer at Google figured the officers just wanted to talk about an unpaid parking ticket. But Gilani also wondered if the officers had a more complicated motive. “Just in case they throw me in Guantanamo, please bail me out,” he told a co-worker. Gilani joked about the US prison for terrorist detainees because he’s a practicing Muslim. But there was nothing funny about this visit. When he entered the lobby, an officer who worked with the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force approached him with a police officer. This is not another story about an immigration raid in the first months of Donald Trump’s presidency. Gilani is a US citizen. He grew up rooting for the Houston Rockets. He says he’s seen way too many episodes of "Law & Order." And he was raised in a Midwestern town with a name straight out of an episode of "The Simpsons": Normal, Illinois. Gilani never felt different until he became an adult. He started getting pulled aside for additional screening every time he got on an airplane. Airport officials would swab his bags for explosives and had to get special clearance to issue him a boarding pass. “This probably happened 15 or 20 times,” Gilani said, “in a row.”  From his current home in the Bay Area, Gilani filed a Freedom of Information Act request to find out why he has so much difficulty traveling. The two officers who visited Gilani at Google said they wanted to talk about his travel problems. But then the subject changed. “One of them asked me how I felt about drone strikes in Pakistan,” Gilani said, “and how awful it must be for the victims.” Gilani has never lived in Pakistan. His parents immigrated to the United States from Lahore, Pakistan, in the '70s. But Gilani only knows his parents' home from occasional trips with his family growing up. The officers' visit with Gilani at Google wasn’t an isolated incident. More than a thousand Muslims in the Bay Area have reported that FBI agents or police have shown up to speak with them. Officers are usually fishing for information about terrorism, or trying to turn Muslim Americans into informants. Widespread FBI surveillance of Muslims had become normal even before Trump took office. The FBI agent visited Sarmad with a local police officer back in 2014. They violated the Safe San Francisco Civil Rights Ordinance, which prohibits city police from directly collaborating in FBI counterterrorism investigations by asking questions. The FBI and the San Francisco Police Department wouldn’t specifically comment for this story. But advocates say the police overstepped their role in asking Gilani to participate in voluntary questioning. Zahra Billoo, the executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) in the Bay Area, worried that Trump’s campaign promises to increase the surveillance of Muslims might actually fuel terrorism. “We were concerned that the rhetoric that Donald Trump was using to target Muslims was going to be leveraged by ISIS,” Billoo said, “to say that America is at war with Islam.” Billoo now hopes that San Francisco can exemplify how communities all over the country can push back against anti-Muslim policies. CAIR helped file a complaint that pressured the San Francisco Police Department to comply with the city ordinance that limits its collaboration with the FBI. The department announced last February that it would stop working with the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force. Several Bay Area organizations, including CAIR, have released an online guide explaining how cities can work to make local law enforcement’s collaboration with the FBI more transparent. Gilani still worries about the future of Muslims here in this country, even for US citizens like himself. During the presidential election, Gilani was featured in an article on Breitbart News about possible terrorists. He had heard of Breitbart but didn’t take the website of the "alt-right" seriously. His attitude has changed now that one of Breitbart's founders, Steve Bannon, has become President Trump’s chief strategist. “It’s totally conceivable that Steve Bannon might put together a list of possible terrorists, and my name’s going to be front and center,” Gilani said. If Trump actually does create a Muslim registry, Gilani fears the climate will become so hostile that American Muslims might have to leave. Some days, he even thinks about moving abroad himself. But this country is Gilani’s home. And he says now he has to learn how to feel comfortable here, even though he suspects he’s still being watched.

Analysts for the Pivotal Research Group wrote that despite digital advertising outpacing the $69 billion spent on U.S. television advertising in 2016, it was not taking away ad dollars as many observers would expect. “Advertisers commonly look to allocate digital budgets to video ad units without necessarily impacting TV spending one way or the other,” the analysts said. The increase in ad spending, which was again dominated by Facebook Inc and Alphabet’s Google, comes as marketers are increasingly wary about where their ads show up online, and how effective it is for them.Facebook and Google accounted for 99 percent of the industry growth, said Pivotal Research, meaning that almost everyone else in the digital ecosystem was either flat or down from last year. Google’s YouTube is in the midst of an ad boycott on its digital video site YouTube after companies like Verizon Communications Inc and Johnson & Johnson found their ads appearing next to extremist and other hate content..Last year also saw Facebook admit to a string of measurement errors in the data is gives to advertisers regarding the amount of people that are watching their video ads.

Recently, Facebook and Google made it clear that they won’t penalize employees for taking a day off and participating in the protests happening in the Bay Area on International Worker’s Day on May 1. Other companies have been silent, however. Vocativ reached out to Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Uber, and Twitter a week ago, but only Uber replied by saying it offers unlimited paid time off so employees are welcome to take time off when they want to. “With the Women’s March, we knew employees would be interesting in attending, so we asked that folks give a heads up to their manager,” an Uber spokesperson told Vocativ. “But again, they were paid given our unlimited vacation policy.” The statements made by Uber, Google, and Facebook, however, unintentionally highlight some of the challenges many low-wage and contracted workers face in the United States. Uber’s drivers, for example, don’t get that paid vacation because they aren’t classified as employees — and therefore would miss out on a full day’s pay for participating. Similarly, at Facebook and Google and other tech companies, many of the lower-paid workers, including security guards, janitors, shuttle-bus drivers, and cafeteria workers, are not direct employees but work for sub-contractors. And they tend not to get the same lavish perks as do Facebook’s engineers or Google’s coders. Facebook told Bloomberg it will make sure its vendors are also allowing their staff to take the day, saying if they don’t, then Facebook will revaluate its ties with the vendor. “At Facebook, we’re committed to fostering an inclusive workplace where employees feel comfortable expressing their opinions and speaking up,” a Facebook spokesperson said. “We support our people in recognizing International Worker’s Day and other efforts to raise awareness for safe and equitable employment conditions.” Google followed Facebook’s statement a week after saying it will give employees the green light to protest and also encouraged its vendors to do the same. “We respect everyone’s choice to act on their beliefs,” a Google spokesperson told BuzzFeed News. “We care deeply about creating an environment at Google where everyone — employees and contractors, engineers, cafeteria workers and janitorial staff — feels comfortable doing so. We’re asking managers to be flexible in accommodating time-off requests and have let out vendor partners know that we support them doing the same.” Although both Facebook and Google said they would revaluate ties with vendors who penalize employees for walking out and protesting, neither company disclosed how they’ll protect employees who are affected. The statement’s put out by Facebook and Google are partly thanks to pressure from California-based labor groups such as the Tech Worker’s Coalition, UNITE HERE and Silicon Valley Rising. These groups have been going around Silicon Valley to convince companies to make a public commitment to ensure all workers (high-paid employees and low-wage subcontractors) are able to safely participate in any May Day activities. This is not the first big immigration-related protest of the year. In February, more than 1,000 Yemeni-owned bodegas and grocery stores closed across New York City to protest Trump’s administration’s policies. Then, later that month, immigrants from around the country decided to skip work or cut class to show how different the U.S. would be in a “day without immigrants.”

That's the good news. The bad news—at least for those who dislike duopolies—is that some estimates by other industry experts show that virtually all of growth in digital ad spending went to Google and Facebook, which already account for more than three-quarters of the U.S. digital ad market. The IAB downplayed this phenomenon in its report, saying there has been a lot of "misreporting" in the media about how the two digital giants are taking most of the revenue growth. "Some of the outside calculations we've seen being used by the media include revenues that go beyond the U.S., for example," the IAB's David Doty told Ad Age. "Another thing they don't understand is traffic acquisition costs. And another thing they don't seem to take into account is losses from some within the industry are actually hiding gains from a broader base." Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. The IAB executive said that the top 10 digital players in its report only accounted for 69% of the growth, which means that 31% of that growth came from outside the top 10. Jason Kint of publishing-industry trade group Digital Content Next has previously written about how Google and Facebook account for virtually all of the growth in ad revenues. He said his latest estimates show the two taking 89% of the growth last year. so @IAB just dropped 2016 #s. Duopoly in full force -> takes 89% of growth. 'Everyone Else' loses more share courtesy of Facebook. @dcnorg pic.twitter.com/urglxDrooM- Jason Kint (@jason_kint) April 26, 2017 Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser, however, went even farther in a research note he sent to clients on Wednesday about the IAB numbers. Wieser said that according to his calculations, Google and Facebook accounted for almost 100% of all the growth in U.S. digital ad revenue last year. The latest figures "highlight the degree to which Google and Facebook dominate the industry presently," Wieser wrote, "as the two rose to capture 77% of gross spending vs. 72% in the year ago period, with 99% of industry growth attributable to the two companies." That's up significantly from the previous year, when Wieser estimated that Google and Facebook accounted for about 65% of all the growth in the U.S. digital ad market in 2015. In an email, the Pivotal analyst said that his projections are based on Facebook's publicly released U.S. ad revenue numbers, as well as estimates of Google's U.S.-based ad revenue (which the company doesn't publicly disclose). Those figures combined with the IAB's totals show that the two have an iron grip on the ad market, he said. While the numbers for Facebook and Google do include what are called traffic-acquisition costs or TAC—that is, money the two pay to publishing partners—Wieser says that doesn't change the fact that they still control a massive amount of the U.S. digital advertising market. "The big point is that if Google and Facebook are the primary interfaces to buyers, over the long-run they own the relationships and the related data," Wieser said. "Every partner they work with is subservient." In other words, their control remains intact. And it shows no signs of slowing down any time soon.

Google's messaging mess is about money, not making your life easier (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/21 10:51am PDTApr 21, 2017 85 Plus 1 on G+ 396 Share on Facebook 121 Share on Twitter Total Shares602 Applications Editorials Article Contents 1 Explainer: business case 2 The falling tower of Babel 3 Money in the messenger 4 Say ‘ello to Allo 5 I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one 6 Jibe talkin’ 7 Conclusion I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem to make sense, look for the money. What I mean is that profitability is often the simplest explanation for a decision that might seem to make little or no sense to someone on the outside of a company looking in. How does this rule apply to Google’s messaging mess? Much ink, and possibly much blood, has been spilt over Google’s recent messaging app strategy (or lack thereof). To some, it is a mangled and unfocused mess of half-baked concepts sent out into the world for us to shill to our increasingly impatient friends and family. To others, it is part of Google’s master plan to move the world forward in a big way that most are too naive to see. In my humble opinion, the explanation may be much simpler: To understand the mess, look for the money. Explainer: business case What does business case have to do with Google’s inability to get its messaging app mess straightened out? We’re getting there, but that requires an understanding of another bit of business jargon called the business case. At large corporations, significant investments of time and resources usually require the approval of the chief financial officer (CFO). In the case of Alphabet, this person happens to be Ruth Porat, a highly successful and talented businesswoman who not only advised President Obama during the financial crisis of ‘07-’09 but who was also rumored to be a potential nominee for Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line. If the bottom line is a net loss, there can be no justification for approval; if the bottom line is a projected gain, then the conversation can continue. And if the business case is compelling enough, a project can move forward. Edit: A portion of this section has been removed for potential inaccuracies around the concept of fiduciary duty in regard to a publicly traded corporation. -Man. Ed. DR. The falling tower of Babel So what does a compelling business case have to do with a simple messaging app? With the hiring of Ms. Porat and the consolidation of Google’s various business ventures under Alphabet, business lines were brought under increasing pressure to bring their costs in line with their revenues. In other words, a business unit can only receive money if it is making money. Under Alphabet, Google’s messaging platform must justify its contribution to the profitability of the company or, like any money-loser, it must either be reimagined or trotted out back to be put down. With that in mind, let’s take a look at Google’s messaging strategy prior to its consolidation under Alphabet. By 2015, all signs pointed toward the idea Google was moving toward a more integrated messaging platform. Two years prior, rumors of “Babel” were rampant and it seemed that Hangouts (though tragically named) would be the platform on which this integration would occur. But what we ended up with was an app that consolidated the instant messaging capabilities of Google Talk and Google+ Messenger with the video chat functionality already offered by the original Hangouts for Google+. Eventually SMS integration was added to the trifecta of instant messaging, video chat, and VOIP and the result was the closest thing to an iMessage for Android as we were going to get. While this may have been near single messenger nirvana (theoretically), in light of what we know now, the question remains: How was this strategy going to generate revenue? Money in the messenger For Apple, iMessage sells iPhones: it is often cited by customers as a reason for their allegiance to iOS. RIM (now Blackberry) made a similar justification when they shot down Jim Balsillie’s business case to make BBM compatible with competing platforms in 2012. The hardware team argued there would be no more reason for folks to buy Blackberries, and we all know how that played out. (Fortunately for Apple, iMessage is not the only reason people continue to buy iPhones, though that's a discussion for another time.) But as I alluded to in a previous column, Google is not a hardware company, it is an advertising company. Google makes its money by surfacing advertisements it deems most relevant to the the consumer. It started off with search results, then email, then your phone--each new platform giving Google a little bit more insight into who you are, what you like, and what kind of ads you are more likely to act upon. Knowing this, what is the business case for a merged messaging platform? Where is the money? One potential business case for generating ad revenue from Hangouts would have been to read your private chats and insert recommendations and links to sites supported by Google’s ad platform into your conversations. In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity. Rather, instead of shoehorning the functionality into an app with a notoriously complicated backend and hoping that users would be amenable to the inclusion of this new functionality, it is my belief that Google sought to instead build a new app from the ground up. Not only would this give Google a chance to reframe the chat intruder as an “Assistant,” it would give them a fresh foundation upon which to build out a messaging platform with a revenue driver already in place. Finally, I feel that the introduction of Allo enabled Google to repurpose Hangouts into a diminished but more focused role as an enterprise chat and conferencing client within the high revenue, low margin G Suite. A money loser on its own, Hangouts is now part of a high earning team. Say ‘ello to Allo I previously mentioned that one way to generate revenue from messaging is to somehow use the content of the messages to drive ad revenue. This is essentially what Google Assistant is in Allo (and now M in Facebook Messenger). For those of you who have used Allo: Do you remember connecting your Google account to the service when it suggested doing so as it would give you more personalized recommendations? Do you remember how friendly and enticing it was to give it access to your location? “I may share your location when I help you in chats with friends.” Heck it even pre-populates a response for you to tap that says “Ok, go on.” As shady as this sounds, these are very masterfully designed opt-ins and I cannot fault Google for crafting them in such a friendly way. The more information Google gets from your chats, the more relevant content the Assistant can generate for you to click on. The more relevant the information surfaced by Assistant is to you, the more likely you are to click a link to a website that hosts Google ads. The more of these websites you are driven to the more money Google makes which increases profits, and enables them to bring that good news to shareholders. Allo was built from the ground up to earn its keep. Whether it is successful is yet to be seen. I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one Now that we know how Google plans to make money from Allo, why not just build SMS fallback into Allo and call it a day? Well for one thing, most of the world has moved on from SMS and uses the much better over-the-top (OTT) method of messaging that serves as the basis for Allo. Additionally, SMS gives Google zero insight into your personal habits and provides them little opportunity to generate any form of revenue. Even if Google were to build SMS fallback into Allo, it would still require both ends of the conversation to have Allo installed in order to drive the rich messages and site links that drive their revenue model. Therefore from a business perspective I can see little incentive for Google to invest in building a reliable SMS fallback system that serves only a portion of the user base and cannibalizes the revenue model upon which Allo is built. Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful. In fact, SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada. The only ones who have ever made money from SMS messages are the carriers and it is clear that they will not give it up unless there is a more viable alternative capable of making them more money than SMS charges. That alternative may already exist in the form of Rich Communications Services (RCS). Jibe talkin’ RCS is a rich messaging standard which many thought would have already replaced SMS by now. Like OTT messaging platforms, RCS is capable of handling the kind of rich communications that would enable a company to indirectly drive revenue by surfacing a link to a partner website, a coupon to make a sale, or the ability to quickly pay off a bill, all within the four walls of the instant messenger. However, unlike OTT messaging services, RCS is dependent on carrier and OEM buy-in and integration to support its proliferation. It is no wonder, then, that it has taken so long for RCS to catch on. However, now that OTT messaging services are showing carriers the compelling revenue models around rich messaging services, slowly but surely they are catching on. Google showed its hand in 2015 when it purchased an RCS platform developer called Jibe. On Acquiring Jibe, Android RCS Software Engineer and Minister of messaging Mike Dodd said “Jibe is a leading provider of RCS services and they’ll continue helping carriers easily deploy RCS to their users.” He mentions carriers for a very specific reason: Because almost nothing runs through a carrier’s pipes unless it’s profitable for the carrier to use it. Since the acquisition, Google has worked quickly to build RCS support into the Android Messages App and has begun exerting its influence on weaker OEMs to pre-install it on their Android devices. Now all that’s left is for the carriers to support the universal RCS profile, which is no mean feat. While the big four US carriers are all signatories of the universal RCS profile, and a number of carriers and OEMs have either vowed to implement the universal profile or have at at least implemented a proprietary version of RCS, time will tell if the standard takes off or gets stuck struggling in the mire of hubristic competition that has dragged out the long slow death of SMS. Conclusion From a frustrated consumer perspective, Google’s messaging app strategy looks scatterbrained and impulsive; appearing to make little or no sense. However, from a business perspective, it shows a company actively seeking out new ways to generate revenue, drive their bottom line, and keep their shareholders happy. This then leaves you, the end user, with a couple of options: Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS or some other niche operating system which won’t have any appreciable effect on Android’s market share. Keep doing what you’ve been doing; keep an app folder called “messaging” on your home screen and continue to piss off your stubborn iOS mates by sending them SMS messages until they download WhatsApp and stop telling you to buy an iPhone. I wish I could end this on a more enlightened note but Google is, at the end of the day, a business - and a business has to make money. And while they remain an impressive and innovative enterprise, I think we as end users falsely expect them to have a robust and seamless solution for everything. Android is a platform, and an open platform at that. There may be no all-in-one messaging client like there was in the halcyon days of desktop instant messengers and the XMPP (Jabber) standard, but Android as a platform is continually evolving and what the future holds is anyone’s guess. Perhaps then, we will one day look back upon this time with nostalgia as we tell our children’s children about what is was like “back in the day” when we communicated with many messengers and our home screens looked like this.

Google needs to understand that a functional, cohesive messaging platform is vital to Android, even if it's not directly profitable. Basically like the Android OS itself. David Ruddock Why? Why does it matter? What about a cohesive messaging model helps Google sell Android to the real customers (vendors - not you and me), when Android itself isn't even profitable? I understand it's a fairly cold and clinical way to look at it, but Google is very much shifting to a revenue-first strategy on products. Just look at Pixel: it is designed to make money, not to win grass-roots fans or showcase Android's diversity like the Nexus line was. Things are very much changing at Google (Alphabet), and it's pretty ridiculous to think that it's just that Google doesn't "get" messaging at this point. They're the second-most valuable company on earth. I think they "get" more than we give them credit for. It's just that their priorities and yours and nowhere near aligned. It's having negative ramifications for consumers, certainly, but I wouldn't call it an "excuse." Kyle Gospodnetich If Apple is also publicly traded and revenue-focused and they "get" messaging, why does Alphabet not? Arthur Dent Apple has a VERY different model for profitability. Luxferro I'm not an Apple user, but they also appear to have much more polished products, both software and hardware. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The display and S Pen of a Note are the only things stopping me from switching to an iPhone. Arthur Dent I gotta say, the display of the 7+ is pretty spectacular, as is the camera. Obv no S-Pen or equivalent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I haven't seen the 7+, but the 6S+ has a very nice display. Much better than I thought it would be. It's just that I'm so addicted to AMOLED. I will definitely be weighing my options on the Note 8 vs. the iPhone 8 this year. Arthur Dent Yeah, coming from a GS6, from the specs I thought OMG the Plus models "only" have 1920x1080 on a 5.5" LCD screen? Weak! Turns out I was wrong (which I can admit), that resolution is just fine at that size (no PenTile), and the colors are excellent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Exactly. When my wife got her iPhone 6S Plus, I thought it was a terrible idea because of the LCD display. After I used it several times, I was really impressed with how good it looks. I also like the software. No, it's not as configurable as Android, but that novelty has worn off for me. And I'm so sick of Google's BS. Everything on the iPhone just works. With one exception. When an iOS update is waiting to be installed, some apps will crash. After I apply the update for her, everything just works again. I don't know why that is. Maybe the apps got updated first. Knowledgeborn Allah Interestingly enough, I bought my first iOS device - the iPhone 7 Plus - last year when it came out, just to see what all the hype was about. And, needless to say, I can definitely understand the appeal. It's better than any Android device I've owned, including the Pixel XL and Galaxy S7 Edge. So, I guess there's that... Jason Edwards Well the next iPhone is suppose to get an OLED screen (Made by Samsung ?) and several document leaks from Apple have mentioned the Pencil working with the iPhone. Whether they bring the Pencil to the iPhone or not is anyone's guess but if they do then you can move on over. We will gladly accept you. Scott Ricketts http://media2.giphy.com/media/IoQBWXhpwsd0c/giphy.gif David Ruddock Apple is almost 100% hardware revenue. Completely different business approach. Lock-in is very important to their success. Kyle Gospodnetich Isn't the high-price of the Pixel evidence of Google going down that path? PS: I am a Pixel XL owner and am definitely locked into Google's ecosystem. Arthur Dent A path on which they have only just begun. One Android phone model, out for less than a year, in the hands of maybe a couple hundred thousand customers vs. several thousand OEM phone models over nearly a decade in the hands of a billion. They have a long way to go, and yet, will never cut out their OEMs either, while Pixel will likely not dominate the market. So it will continue to have to rely on software/ad revenue much more than Apple. Knowledgeborn Allah Unfortunately, these aren't the same thing... Being locked into Google's ecosystem doesn't require any type of specific hardware. In fact, you can use almost all of Google's services on a regular PC by just going to their website. That's their ecosystem. Being locked into Apple's ecosystem is entirely different. For example, you can't make iTunes purchases, read iBooks, send and receive iMessages, talk to someone on FaceTime, or do any of that other Apple-specific stuff without an Apple device. In order to use their services, you have to buy their hardware products. I'm primarily locked into Google's ecosystem too, and my primary devices are an iPhone 7 Plus and an iPad Air 2. I have Android devices too, but I don't need them to stay connected within the ecosystem. dcdttu As easy as it is to say that Google's services (and ads) work perfectly well on both Android and iOS, that may not always be true. Of course you want your own platform to be the best it can be, and Android is 90% there - the glaring exception is messaging. Knowledgeborn Allah How do you explain the fact that nearly all of Google's apps run significantly better in iOS than they do on Android? Google Drive, Google Docs, YouTube, even Gmail - they're all much better and more optimized on iOS than they are on my Android devices, including my Nexus 6P and Pixel XL. Why do you think that is? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because, Android, as a platform, sucks compared to iOS. Android has a richer API and gives app developers a lot more flexibility, but the basic platform is a mess. Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 I wouldn't necessarily say that Android "sucks" as a platform, but they definitely have their shortcomings. I'll just say that there's plenty of room for improvement. Lol ddevito Three reasons: 1. Java 2. JVM 3. Flexible app store approval policy Knowledgeborn Allah I see how that's true when it comes to traditional third-party apps... But Google's own apps? Why would they (Google) make THEIR apps more structured and standardized on a competing platform than on their own Android platform? Personally, I think it's because Google doesn't really care about Android. It's a means to an end (establishment of their software and services), and it's not the focus of their business. That's also why they won't fight SOC manufacturers to update Android for longer than 2 years. They don't really care about that, as long as you have Google Play Services installed. ddevito I don't know if I'd go that far, but I'd say their iOS devs are not the same devs who write their Android counterparts. Say what you want about Apple, but their dev platform is pretty sweet. Swift is amazing, Java can't compare. Time for Java to go. Knowledgeborn Allah I would completely agree with you concerning the Swift vs Java factor when it comes to development, if it wasn't for the fact that it's been like this for quite some time. Even when Apple was still using Java, iOS apps were still significantly better than the same apps on Android. Regarding their developers, I can't argue with that, because I honestly don't know. I just know that it seems to be a pattern. Most apps tend to be better on iOS than they are on Android, even though Android has a much larger consumer base. And Google's apps are included in that, and there are very few exceptions. ddevito It's also not just the language but the toolsets. Fire up XCode and open Interface Builder. Then run Android Studio and try to do the same thing. It's a joke. Even Microsoft's Xamarin solution is way better at designing UI elements for Android apps than Android Studio. Apple's software is light years ahead of Android's unfortunately. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree... I guess that's the unfortunate position Android is in right now. dcdttu This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution like Assistant later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Jason Rittenhouse Because if you have both then you will use both, and Google doesn't want you using SMS at all because they can't monetize it. dcdttu The majority of Android users using the monitizable data-messaging service while a small minority are using the fallback SMS service is a helluva lot better than virtually nobody using Allo as it is today. Their gamble that Assistant was enough to get people to use Allo without SMS fallback/web client/multi-device support failed miserably. Jason Rittenhouse i didn't think that SMS fallback specifically was the reason nobody is using it (could be wrong though, just going off of personal experience here). personally, i don't care about SMS and don't know anyone else who does either. we all dislike allo regardless of SMS fallback. for us, the other missing features you mentioned are far more important than SMS. dcdttu SMS fallback is crucial for a universal app because it allows you to message people that don't also have the app. Just like iMessage. Most people that don't care about SMS are from a country that's not the USA. wicketr People buying Android phones vs Apple phones is more profitable to Google, right? I would hope that Google is concerned about indirect gains vs direct gains only. Right now, iMessage is the best. It not only locks people into iOS, but it draws people away from Android to iOS. That hurts Google financially. Google should want to create something that frees Apple users of the chains that lock them into iOS. They apparently don't care about that. I mean, why does Google/Android even have voice calling and SMS functionality at all. It's not like adding those features is directly helping their bottom line. Just let Apple make all the devices and focus on making apps/services for iOS, right? /s Knowledgeborn Allah Google makes their iOS apps better than their Android apps, interestingly enough... However, they still need Android to market their services on a wider platform for one major reason: Google Play Services, or, to be more specific, app permissions. Since Apple keeps their ecosystem locked down, there are a lot of things that Google Drive (for example) has access to on an Android device, that it doesn't have access to on an iPhone. The more Android phones are sold, the more information Google (Alphabet) has access to. bekifft No actually it's not necessarily more profitable. Google has tons of apps and services on iOS, many of which are (far) superior to their Android versions. wicketr Well if Android isn't as profitable as iOS for Google then they might as well shut Android down based on the entire point of this article. The only reason to have Android is to make more money than if they just ran all their services on iOS Bottom line is you are completely ignoring the value of Google Play and their entire ecosystem and not having to give Apple a share of their revenue. dcdttu If you're shifting to a revenue-first strategy, I suggest looking at one of the best in the business: Apple. Pay particular attention to their not-directly-profitable-but-massively-important-as-to-why-people-love-their-iPhone messaging platform. Again, iMessage isn't directly profitable for Apple but it's the #1 reason why my iOS friends will never leave the iPhone. I don't think you can find a better argument than that, direct profits be damned. Knowledgeborn Allah Very true... But we have to keep in mind that Apple is a hardware company. People stick with iMessage, among many other reasons, because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem. Android is too fragmented and diverse for Google to implement a plan like that. Not only do different OEMs have their own messaging services, but, in many cases, the carriers do too! It's very unlikely that all of them with consolidate under Google's banner, which is why Google is now experimenting with this new "Android Messages" platform. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ People stick with iMessage because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem AND you can still use it to SMS people who aren't on Apple's ecosystem. dcdttu That delicious SMS fallback that iMessage and only iMessage has. Allo's product manager flat said (via Twitter) that SMS fallback wasn't necessary because no one wanted it - showing how little Google actually knows about what makes messaging apps successful. This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Knowledgeborn Allah That's true, and I don't know why people say Android can't have SMS fallback because of Apple's patents. It's not too hard to add SMS fallback into a messaging service on Android. There's a prominent one that already exists on Android: Signal! If you message somebody who has Signal, it sends a Signal encrypted message. If that person doesn't have Signal, it falls back to SMS by default. Google could easily make a messaging app that does something similar to that, but they don't want to do that. Maybe it's because it's not profitable, or maybe it's something else. But, in any case, they could do it. They're just choosing not to. Suicide_Note Maybe Google should buy Signal, and put them in charge of Google's messaging platform for Android? Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 As nice as that would be, Google would never go in the direction of Signal (or even Apple), making messages end-to-end encrypted by default, because that would prevent them from getting more information about their users. They need as much information as possible. They couldn't get anything like that from something like Signal or iMessage... Even though, ironically, WhatsApp also encrypts their messages end-to-end, and they're owned by Facebook. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ bekifft Please God no. Leave Signal alone. Craig Nelson In his defense WhatsApp is hugely popular and doesn't have SMS but I agree with you pretty much Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed... Plus, of course, it's the dedicated default standard. Nobody with an iOS device needs to download iMessage. That helps out a lot too. dcdttu Samsung just made Google Play Music its phone's default music player. Gmail is a required app if you want Android with Google Play Services. I guarantee you that Google, if they wanted, could force a messaging standard on Android. Even if they couldn't force it, they surely could have created one good enough that they wouldn't have had to force it - but it may be too late for that. Knowledgeborn Allah Yeah, I think it's too late for them to try to force a messaging app that people would actually use, lol. Now, they could force their hardware partners to put their proprietary messenger into their dedicated Android services package, like how they did with Hangouts. I heard they're halfway trying to do that with Allo, but we'll see how that holds up. dcdttu Yea, that ship has sailed. Makes you wonder how the author thinks all these barely-used apps are going to be profitable when everyone is using iMessage and WhatsApp instead. Knowledgeborn Allah Exactly... 😂 DragoCubed Yeah. By doing that they can at least enforce that app on devices running that version of Android and higher. That would be the best solution but the thing is that it can't work on iPhones. I've said it before but it seems that Google doesn't want to put any Android exclusives. Google just won't ever do it, even though it would solve the messaging problem. And yeah, it is way too late. Sir_Brizz Android Messages isn't on everything, either, if we're going that direction. Hangouts was a required app so something like Allo that is actually competitive could be as well. Even if it's not, if Google had an app they could recommend that was competitive with iMessage, that would set the right tone for the platform. The fact that you have to go to third parties whose apps aren't even in the same ballpark to get such a popular (in the US) feature says a lot about the tone of Android. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree, but I think people have the wrong idea about iMessage. One of the best things about iMessage is the fact that it's the default messaging platform. Google needs a good messaging app, but they also need it to be the default messaging app on Android. At this point, I don't think that's ever going to happen. Sir_Brizz I don't disagree, but I do think at this point they just need something they can talk about and recommend that is actually competitive and it would at least help improve the platform's image. Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed. abc All Android users have access to Chrome and every other Google app. Nothing is stopping Google from having a pre-installed messaging app along with their other pre-installed apps. Certainly, more useful than a G+ app that barely anyone uses. Ryan You dont really understand what you are talking about and if you're even remotely correct, Google doesnt understand selling products at all. Messaging is part of a platform. You don't have to make money directly off of messaging. Hell, you can lose money on it directly and still have it contribute to success. Its a loss leader, something you intentionally dont make money off of but it makes you more appealing to customers (and you're wrong on the vendors being the real customers) so you have their focus when you do sell them something that is profitable. Having a better platform means more people want to use it, more peoples data can be sold, more people will buy stuff on Google Play, etc. And that isnt the vendors, its US. The vendors only care if WE will buy their phone, and making Android more appealing means more people will buy their phone than the competing platform (IOS). Josh Brown How do the make money off of Google Photos? How do they make money off of Google Translate? It makes Google's Android attractive to use so that people will use their services. Messaging is a huge part of it. If they are not careful someone will sink money into services and use AOSP to rival Google. Google could be the next Microsoft if they don't stop wasting time and money. ddevito No way, I totally disagree. All these messaging apps make it confusing to the average Android user. When they see their friends and coworkers use iMessage on iPhones and how much SIMPLER it is because it's all in one app, people will use that (among other reasons) to dump Android and get an iPhone. perfectalpha David...you are correct in what you're saying, but Google is really taking a beating in areas that are going to increasingly become important over the next few years. We rave about Google Assistant, but Amazon Alexa is the one getting the play with 3rd party products. You saw it at CES, you see it with smartphones from Huawei, and I even saw it in my email with the Ecobee 4 (cause I'm all bout the smart home as well). Samsung is doubling down on Bixby. Those are the two largest Android smartphone OEMs. That isn't good. For all the great work Google does, they're increasingly shutting themselves out of areas that will prove important in the future. Google relies on services and if consumers are choosing other platforms, it has the chance to negatively impact their existing platforms. Case in example...Facebook has messaging on lockdown. The more users on that platform, the more that will look at Facebook videos and Facebook Live for entertainment vs YouTube. There are people in powerful places anticipating messaging apps being the browsers of the future. It isn't about having a platform out there, as Google+ has shown, you need to have legitimate mindshare with your platform. I personally believe they're past the point of no return when it comes to messaging. They're like Microsoft with Windows Phone...rebooting and hoping they strike gold (they won't). Google is doing well (every tech company is to be honest that doesn't make hardware minus Apple), but they need to be relentless about user experience first and foremost. Saying it is only about money is a bad strategy, especially when Facebook will be kicking their ass with 2 messaging platforms sporting over a billion users a piece. h4rr4r Such a shift among older tech companies is what left a place for Google to exist. The same will happen again. Raymond Hawkins Isn't Android itself quite profitable though? Not just selling to device manufacturers but the portion of every play store purchase that they get? HSidhu David is Google staff. lol netizen Of course It is, what else is something else for from G? :-) George Yup, its just as we suspected... it's definitely about monetizing those stickers... dash It's not so much about money as it is Google not wanting to get sued EU regulators if you ask me they're already under scrutiny in the EU for having a mobile Monopoly if they baked a standard messenger into Android the way iOS has imessage the EU would be all over them for taking money away from carriers and other apps Rod Why doesn't Apple get sued as well? dash Apples market share is much smaller in comparison and they are a closed system only apple makes iphones.

Mace Moneta The new app is called "G'Day" and it's essentially the same as Allo, but adds sparkle effects to messages. Unfortunately, Allo's code could not be updated to include sparkle effects; a complete rewrite was required, hence the new app. The problem that Google has at this point is that some people would have read that and believed it.

I don't see how they can resist the temptation to use the blocking algorithm to drive more people to use adsense, doubleclick, or any other means of advertising that Google can monetize. Jesse Corbett If I may propose a theory, Google knows that for ads which are otherwise equal in quality, their ability to serve personalized ads is without a doubt the best, this is likely less about improving user experience and more about creating a level playing ground, where other companies can't use cheap tactics like bad ads to get the upper hand. No need to prefer their own ads, because when all ads are equal, Google will win every time. b_boogey_xl I like Allo. Arthur Dent Al-lol b_boogey_xl Oh, and Duo is NOT a messaging app. Please stop grouping it in when you need to make the lame point of the amount of messaging apps that are available from Google. Antony What do you like allo for ? Does it offer anything different from an app with much bigger user base like WhatsApp ? Really curious to know b_boogey_xl I use Allo to talk to friends and family, whom we've all switched from Hangouts. Honestly, I don't need the entire world on the app so long as the people I talk to the most are on it. I'm in the US so WhatsApp isn't that big over here. I also do enjoy using all the little features that it offers, like shout and whisper, Assistant in conversations is actually useful, not for everything but useful and I'm sure Google will have more tricks up their sleeve for it. Allo the app isn't a bad messenger at all, by far. It's light weight, fast and runs really well. I find that people who complain about All aren't really talking about the experience of using the app but more about having to download a new service and convince others to use it (hence no one is using it jokes 🙄) but to me, you're either part of the solution or apart of the problem when it comes to who uses it. Funny thing is, if we all decided to use it, there wouldn't be a problem. 7-down I like Meelo more. Google's new messaging app in beta testing right now. b_boogey_xl … 🙄 abc At least there's one of you. b_boogey_xl HAHAHAHAHA!!!! Oh man!! That was so funny. You are hilarious!!! It's so funny and clever!!! I totally get it. It's like you're trying to imply that Allo isn't popular so I must be the only one using the app!! Wow! Genius!! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/05459ebf579e28adaea54382e65d7597fa0c10c35ea549fbe30b5a8e142a42aa.gif Shane Redman "Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful." Is this not the incentive that they need to get more users on Allo? Sure, it doesn't bring in anything from messages, but it DOES bring in more users! Which have to be minimal right now (even though I think Allo is an awesome messenger, no one I know uses it beyond 2 friends). Sir_Brizz I'm the same. I actually like Allo but almost nobody I know uses it for several reasons. Marty That's probably the case with Chrome too, why Google won't ever improve it. Ryu "I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem make sense, look for the money." Is the typo in the first sentence intentional because it has money in it? If so, clever. If not, you are missing a "to" before make. :P Anyhow, good article. David Ruddock Fixed, I may have messed that up. mark555055d yep, this is no longer yesterday's Google. "Don't be evil need" not apply. Antony Yep . Since the created alphabet that model seems to have changed 😭 Charles This is so very very true, it started with The death of Nexus, then Pixel pricing, and continues today in the smallest of changes such as moving your Google Home shopping list from the more convenient Keep to the lagging Google Express. There's a huge push at Google campus right now for profitability over consumer appeasement and sadly enough it is starting to show through in the end results more and more frequently... Antony Totally agree with you .. this is one of the main reasons why I am considering switching to iPhones ddevito Same here. I just switched full-time to my iPhone 6s (from OnePlus 3) and I don't miss Android yet. The apps are WAY better, the OS is way more polished and simpler, and the whole device is frankly just more reliable. I use my OP3 less and less everyday. Google is sinking their own ship Sir_Brizz I don't really get the "iOS is simpler" POV. I find it harder to do just about anything on iOS. Having a consistent and friendly messaging solution is one thing, but has nothing to do with the OS really. ddevito I find Android way more powerful, flexible and capable. But on it may do fewer things than Android, but it does (most) of them better. Notifications are still rather rubbish, and sharing data between apps still isn't there yet. But everything else is great. 3D touch is so amazing, I wish more apps used it properly. Sir_Brizz I've had to use iPhones for work in the past but I can count on one hand the number of times I even remembered that 3D Touch was a thing. My wife exclusively uses an iPhone 7+ and she doesn't even know what 3D Touch is. It's a gimmicky feature that sounds good in a presentation but really doesn't end up being used much. I'm not arguing that iOS doesn't have some advantages over Android. I would rate the platform higher in some key areas. However, if notifications are an important facet of your device, I don't see how you can rely on iOS. They really are that bad in comparison. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I know several people with iPhones. I've never seen them use 3D Touch or Siri. Sir_Brizz I feel the same. I've showed my wife 3D Touch a few times on her 7+. She thought it was interesting at the times, but I asked her about it today and she said "What is that?" ddevito Just because most people don't know it exists doesn't make it not useful. I agree most people don't know what it is, then again most people who have iPhones don't care about tech at all really, they just want to text and post to Facebag. ddevito 3D Touch isn't gimmicky at all, I'd argue every smartphone should have it. Hell Android copied it. It's very useful to get something direct out of an app. Android had app shortcuts which were essentially the same thing but it never caught on. Notifications aren't the worst, rich notifications are actually really powerful, but really they just need to be simply grouped in iOS and it'll be much better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I'd argue that it's not intuitive, and not easy to use. You have to get used to the pressure that gets the result. The S Pen hover for the Note is much more intuitive because it just happens. You don't have to think about it. That's one of the main reasons I'd miss the S Pen if I get an iPhone. The other is that the S Pen makes selecting text incredibly easy. Much easier than using your finger. ddevito I totally disagree - just push down with your finger, it's quite easy. Once you use it a few times on a few apps you know how to do it. My wife borrowed my iPhone for a few days and she even got used to it and said she wished her 6P had something similar (which it does, but the context is way different). I do agree with copying and pasting text. I like Android's way better, it's faster. On iOS it takes a while, quite annoying. Using the Google Keyboard takes even longer. Sir_Brizz App shortcuts and 3D Touch aren't anything alike really. In one scenario they kind of offer similar results. App shortcuts never caught on because there is a fundamental problem with the concept and that is lack of intuitiveness. The current implementation has the same problem. However, I think Google just realized it was pointless to remove just because most people won't ever use it. And you can now add app shortcuts directly to your home screen which actually increases the usability in the end. Anyway, 3D Touch is still a gimmick designed for a presentation. And the notifications are abysmal on iOS. I'm not being overly critical about it, it really is just that much worse on iOS than Android. I literally rely on receiving and responding to my notifications. I would constantly miss them on iOS. ddevito How is getting a direct result, or a specific screen within an app (or others) gimmicky? It provides a faster way to get the data you want, then get out. So since you're such an expert it seems, besides not being able to respond directly to notifications, and not being grouped, what else makes iOS notifications so "abysmal"? I don't disagree that Android's are better, I'm just generally curious on why you think this is so. I'm looking forward to your OBjective answer ;-) Sir_Brizz The specific capability you are talking about may or may not be gimmicky. The 3D Touch functionally is a gimmick, though. It's entire purpose is to present well. The majority of iOS problems with notifications are just discoverability. But that by itself is a big enough problem that it really drops it down that far. Most people I know with iPhones have a tendency to just completely miss notifications of texts and messages if they don't see and respond to them right away. I understand because I had the exact same problem with my iPhone. ddevito I totally agree without having them stay persistent you can totally miss them. Android's notification tray is very underrated and underappreciated Sir_Brizz Yeah, that's all I was saying. Sorry for the confusion :) ddevito Thanks mate. Trust me I'm a huge Android fan, rocking a OnePlus 3 right now also. I prefer Android, just hope this hardware holds up. Sir_Brizz I really hope the Pixel 2 is actually no compromises. ddevito You and me both. ddevito What's important to me is getting updates when they're released, having good and consistent battery life, having good customer support if I need it, having a good and consistent camera, and enjoying great apps. Sure Android can give me most of that, but never all of any of them, I love the OS and ecosystem but the hardware is lacking. I'm not a Samsung fan so I feel I don't have any great high end options. And the Pixel isn't proven yet, it needs to show massive improvement for the second iteration. Is the iPhone perfect? Hell no, it's a toy, it's restrictive and dumbed down in lots of ways. But the damn thing just works, every time. Sir_Brizz Honestly, most of that is regularly subjective. If you like the iPhone, that's great. But it's not an all around improvement from Android, it's trading one set of compromises for another set. ddevito Oh I agree, I'm not saying the iPhone is the smartphone I've been waiting for all these years. I'm just saying my priorities have shifted, I expected Android to catch up in a lot of areas. It has for most of them, but I feel personally it still needs a alot of revamping for the most basic of things, like the ones I mentioned. Rod Faulty battery? ddevito I hope not. I've had it since October and it's been great, but ever since upgrading to Nougat battery life has gone South. I'm hoping OnePlus can fix it. Rod What caused such drain, then? ddevito No idea, I don't see too many wakelocks so the only culprit left is Android OS - so probably Oxygen OS ersouza It's an interesting theory, but there's no real concrete evidence here that the approach is at all profitable. And if this approach is somehow a profitable one, why aren't other companies diversifying their messaging apps like Google has? David Ruddock No one is saying the approach is profitable. That's a very different question. The issue is that apps like Allo and Android Messages RCS *can* have profitable business models. There's no guarantee any of it will work. ersouza But you're saying "follow the money" while showing no concrete proof that this is a profitable approach. It kind of needs to do that. There's been more than ample time to determine one way or the other, giving how long they've been messing with at least 2-3 different messaging services at a time. newtonfb That was one of the best articles on AP in a long time. Finally, a well fact based article arguably the most controversial aspects of Android. Morten Ulv People always ask "WHY?", but never stop to think on that question before going on a rant of how stupid Google is and how they don't understand what is so obvious to everyone else. Why didn't Google just focus on Hangouts? The ability to advertise on the service may have been a factor, but I'm not convinced that this has ever been a driving factor for Google. "Build a great service (that people want to use) and the money will come" has always been their motto. Hangouts is a niche product with little chance to capture significant market share. There are currently 3 ways to make a successful messaging app: 1. Piggyback on a social network like Messenger. And that is what Google tried with G+. 2. Bundle it on the users of an OS like iMessage, but Google can't force Hangouts on users like Apple can. 3. Spread through the use of phone numbers. And since this is the only currently known option left, Google had to create a new app to ever have the chance to capture the market. But what chance do they have in a saturated market? At the end of the day, what we enthusiasts think, matter little to the strategy Google has to go for. It may bother our OCD that Google has multiple apps, but there is no better way to succeed, unless you have a time machine. Christopher Bement They can totally monetize Hangouts. Gmail saves a chat log, they already scan your Gmail for ad service and Google now information. Morten Ulv I'm inclined to agree. The problem with Hangouts was it's low growth potential. makapav Everything has a low growth potential if you don't have a vision and you throw idiotic developers at it. makapav Google already has everyone's email address in your contact address book. That should have been enough to integrate your communication with everyone else on your contact list without the need for having the invite b******* that currently exists and hangouts. This would have been just like What's App. Every Android phone is activated with a Gmail account. Link that to a phone number and your set from all three points. Morten Ulv Hm? Whatsapp uses phone numbers, just like Allo. And the problem isn't getting people's contacts, its to get people to use the app. Rod The own name is questionable. makapav Google didn't care and thought they could take the same lazy half baked approach with Allo as Hangouts. Even today Hangouts has 10% feature parity with mainstream competitors while Allo has 5%. They took one year to develop features into Hangouts. You can't capture market with poor app discoverability, immature product and no user engagement of feedback. The failure of Hangouts is not happenstance or competition, it is Google's laziness and poor product management. UtopiaNH Hangouts was under the google + team which lost direction, leadership and backing when Google+ became a wide joke and leadership backed away from the plan and the main architect of it left the company. It only recently got moved internally to the Gapps team as things got restructured internally. Rod Allo is even worse. They must not think about how the app name sounds in other languages. Telegram, for example, sounds OK in other languages as well. It's straightforward. abc Yeah, except nobody is using their messaging apps, so maybe they should have listened to what people were saying. So many people said they had no reason to switch from an app that all their contacts use to an app that no one uses. Until Google has an answer to that question, they are wasting their own time. Morten Ulv Capturing huge market shares with any social app is extremely hard to do. Sure you can win over us geeks with the right features, but that doesn't convince the market at large. You just have to have the right app at the right time and get lucky. No successful messaging app started with a core of geeks (not that it would hinder success, it's just not needed). They may fail, but how would you know that without trying? You don't. makapav Saw your other responses. You are borderline a fanboy or trolling. Google dropped the ball and didn't even give Hangouts a chance. They are fully to blame. Morten Ulv Hangouts didn't live up to it's potential, but it is unlikely that it could have gained a lot of traction among regular people. As you, I would have loved it if they just made one great app for us, and not giving a fuck if they had a billion users or not. Here I was only offering explanations as to why, just as the article did. I may very well be a fanboy, while you take the role of armchair geniusbesserwisser. Fresh360 I thought I was about to read a satirical rant about greed but was pleasantly surprised that this article is so well written and informative. I really thought Google had it all wrong but maybe, just maybe they are doing it all right (financially). dcdttu Except, you know, if Google wanted to really profit from messaging, they'd create something that drove people toward their messaging products, not away. I highly doubt their current approach profits at all with such low adoption rates. They'd have been better off with one solid app. MikeOxlong That's because there was no David Rudduck involvement. Think about it... 4Ui812 Make it now break it .... remake it now break it. That seems to be Google's strategy. Antony The only thing that this strategy from Google made me realize is that Google is no longer a company that wants to change the world it is just yet another company that seeks revenue and the only thing I did here is totally neglect any messaging or social app by Google. and just switch to someone who is actually passionate about connecting people which is Facebook's WhatsApp and a small company like telegram and one day maybe even switch to iOS . Their business model is clearer pay for what you get while Android is too complicated . Steve Jobs was right Ailín Ó’S This is why I just use WhatsApp. It has all my friends/family on it and all the features I want. No need to bother with Google and their ridiculous policy of "let's have a million messaging apps" Andrew Whatsapp would be a solid 9/10 for me if they let me use the system emoji, I get that it makes it universal but I like my yellow blobs Ailín Ó’S Yeah I agree, I get that WhatsApp do it for uniformity but it's annoying to see different emoji on Facebook Messenger and Hangouts (for example), but WhatsApp is by far the king of messaging in Europe so ho hum! Rod What? Whatsapp is horrid. Telegram stomps on it. Sir_Brizz That's ok, but you are dealing with Facebook and their let's have a million ways to message people. I feel like WhatsApp still has a huge question mark over it for the foreseeable future. Who knows what will happen when Facebook finally decides to try to make back their 12 billion dollars. Cakefish Thank Gaben that Valve isn't a public traded company. Sam Del Valle Google has a messaging addiction https://media.giphy.com/media/l4Ki2obCyAQS5WhFe/giphy.gif Jose Romero I gave up on Allo and Hangouts. I also ported my Google Voice number into T-mobile. All I use now is Android Messages and I don't miss the others at all. Suicide_Note Messages is one of their best apps, for sure. Adonis K. I don't even use Messages anymore switched it to Facebook's Messenger. freshprince_87 Facebook messenger is buggy and garbage. Your better off using Whatsapp Adonis K. First of Android Messages is an SMS app. I said I use Messenger as an alternative to Messages which means I'm using Messenger to send and recieve SMS. How on earth will Whatsapp help me with that? It's completely offtopic freshprince_87 No it isn't off topic. Most people don't Facebook messenger for SMS. They most likely use their default SMS app on their phone. And since you said you use Facebook messenger, I assumed you used it for instant messaging. And if that was the case, whatsapp is the better option in most cases. The new iMessage for Android called invi is something you should use instead of Facebook messenger. It does both IM and SMS Ryan It seems more simple than all of this, they a disjointed and unorganized organization. They want to change things but nobody is actually controlling the monkeys at the typewriters. Messaging is a critical part of the PLATFORM. The platform that secures Google's space in mobile search, music, etc. They dont monetize messaging or Android, the monetize selling you the crap through it AND selling your information. So there is money to be made in losing money developing messaging. Its used everywhere and its called a "loss leader." Its something you dont expect to make money on to get people in the doors to buy something you do make money on. Its not as simple as "make money or be taken out back to be shot." You dont understand business well enough. Law One of the biggest flaws people bring up when they talk about Android is, "oh, it seems so hard to use" I don't think it is but sometimes, most times, consumers want a unified type of service across the board that is recognizable. ddevito Let's compare Apples to Apples shall we? (I use an iPhone 6s and OnePlus 3 daily) Despite this mess, Allo whips iMessage. The Google bot, gif search, and easier (and way more flexible) file share makes iMessage look outdated and slow. All iMessage is good for is for SMS, sending confetti and balloons. Jordan L I think Allo works great too, me and about 5 other people I chat with use it. web client and chat back up will make it even better. Suicide_Note I like Allo a lot, but use it only with my wife, since it lacks SMS fallback. For all of my other contacts i just use Google Messages. I don't want to ask people to install a particular app just to be able to message them. If Google incorporated SMS fallback into Allo, it'd be the only messaging app i need/use. Sir_Brizz Same, but it does really need chat history backup and a web client and maybe integration into Fi/Voice for me. Jordan L I've always said this: google just needs to make Allo enrollment mandatory on ALL android devices. solved. I guess this can't happen. iMessage enrollment is automatic when you setup a new iphone, so EVERYONE iphone user is enrolled! most people with phones are REALLY bad at tech. they can barely install/setup apps. BUT they sure as hell will go though the initial phone setup. this is where you have to put the enrollment. Adrien Aubel But then you still couldn't reach all your iPhone friends right? Allo won't support SMS :( Jordan L But a default enrollment/install of Allo would lead to 1+ billion installs. At that point iPhone people might actually install Allo.... Ahhhhh but I just contradicted myself. Most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps. Hmmm.... Then we do need RCS or SMS. Adrien Aubel Hehe, basically Btw, most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps because they have one that works great for them out of the box, called Messages, doing almost everything they'd want to and letting them reach *any* friend. Which is what we're trying to build for Android at invi :) Rod Monopoly. Grey Look at Hangouts Chat - the new app. Look at how it integrates with all of Google's other offerings. THAT is a way to generate revenue. THAT is the power of a good messaging app. If Hangouts Chat features were integrated into regular Hangouts, you'd see an app everyone wanted to use. And guess what, Hangouts already supports stickers. It's not hard. Don't make excuses. Google is clueless, not trying to "drive their bottom line". ddevito While I generally agree with this article, this is obvious - if you're going down this route, then why not just mention that Android in general is a simpler, better and most effective way to generate more ad revenue for Google? This messaging mess isn't a way to make money, it's a clear sign of lack of leadership and product vision. mickeyB88 Its either nostalgia or naivety, but this doesn't surprise me. I've been continually growing more cynical of products over the years, and it just like you said. When it doesn't make sense to/for a consumer, follow the money. It seems as if there was a "back in the day" of technology where all anyone made was something that improved over a previous iteration, but it's always the money, whether they generate a faithful install base and change later or just keep that base by slowly changing so the shock doesn't cause mass exodus. Any product that starts out as genuinely useful either continues to be so, but loses money because they're not "innovating", or it changes to the detriment of the user because it's losing money. This can apply to pretty much any product marketed, whether it be games (f2p especially) or a product with apps that are "free" to use. We take all the data collection that Google does for granted because they deliver useful products, but then you have situations where they can't stop making new apps and refuse to market them properly, or don't seem to try to get new users at all. Then the app ends up like Allo, with a huge initial install number then quickly dying off. This bullshit is exactly what's pushing me to lean towards an iPhone, but I know eventually that bubble will burst (if it isn't already) and we're left with two platforms that don't seem to be very consumer-friendly. Bill Didn't Google try to buy WhatsApp for a lot of money? Sir_Brizz Rumor has it. Luxferro be glad they didn't, as they likely would have ruined it Sir_Brizz Don't get too excited. Rod As if it wasn't bad enough already. Lol Luxferro I have never used it. but considering how popular it is worldwide, they did something right. The same can't be said for anything Google has made. The only reason their messaging apps have 1/2 the stats they do is they pre-installed them at one point in time, and probably count app updates as install #'s. Rod It came out when there was barely any competition, and SMS was expensive in developing countries. People loved the idea of messaging "for free". That's why it sticked. But, as a service, Whatsapp sucks. The backup sucks, the in-built gallery sucks, the database code sucks.... SunnyStroker Always believed that a prerequisite for employment at Google was you must have ADD, (attention deficit disorder). They simply cannot complete anything stable without moving onto something else. Google; Always Half-Baked, Always in Beta johdaxx You figure their bill paying for an SMPP connector isn't cheap either...someone's got to pay the tremendously exorbitant prices for the SMSs, even if you're buying them wholesale. Kevin Davis The screenshot at the end of the article says it all for me. Not no, but HELL NO. 1/2 a dozen apps to communicate effectively. GTFOH. perfectalpha Hands down one of the best articles written that clearly illustrates why silly decisions get made and PERHAPS provides them with insights why their place of employment makes silly decisions. Here's the deal, everything you posted above is EXACTLY why Google cannot build a successful messaging app. The whole purpose of a communications app is to help people communicate. If Google is more concerned about getting data from the content, it is an automatic failure because they're putting internal interests ahead of user experience. We have heard time and time again what folks want, yet Google continues to fail on delivering that. Again, everybody posting knows what is common sense, but it is what it is. Margaritas Ante Porcos IMO the only thing Google achieved by now is that we all ignore Google messaging solutions in favour of Whatsapp. Google lost millions of users in that regard. If Google sees money in losing apps users than be it. Jokes aside, Google has not only lost millions of specific apps users but also reputation. That will be hard to rebuild. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2ca30070f6fabc67579625a0df20395e6b673d828a835fe66eaf0b630f8d66a7.jpg F4LL0U7 Very well written article -- I bet you're 100% right. I'm sticking with Hangouts. Since I use my Google Voice number for everything, my texts and voicemail still go through that app, as well as my Hangouts obviously. I was forced to install the Android Messenger, but basically only for SMS updates from my carrier. Brett Linking Google's messenger mess to a fiduciary duty is quite a reach. Shareholder derivative suits are a threat for any public company, but this is a vast overstatement of Google's Board's obligations. The Business Judgment Rule gives the Board wide latitude to make decisions that it thinks are in the best interests of the company (whether immediately leading to a profit or not). And Google/Alphabet has shown time and time again that it will allow experimentation to occur -- even at a great loss -- for years with only the potential for a payout far down the road. See driverless cars, Glass, Chrome etc.which don't directly make a single penny. Even these *vastly more expensive* projects don't lead to shareholder derivative suits. And investors are warned in the 10K that: "The idea of trying new things is reflected in some of our new, ambitious projects both within Google and Other Bets. Everything might not fit into a neat little box. We believe that is exactly how to stay relevant. Many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android, and when we launched Chrome. But as those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices, and a safer, popular browser, respectively, we continue to look towards the future and continue to invest for the long-term. We won't become complacent, relying solely on small tweaks as the years wear on. As we said in the 2004 Founders' IPO Letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in because they are the key to our long-term success. We won't stop asking "What if?" and then working hard to find the answer. See https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000165204416000012/goog10-k2015.htm Google may have decided each of its projects needs to be more self-sustaining, but that's a typical business decision and has nothing to do with a fiduciary duty. Contrary to what's presented here, Google's Board does not have an "obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability." If that were the case, every public company not consistently increasing profits would be in breach of the duty. That's simply not the case. The decision may be part of a realization that Google's traditional ad business cannot print money forever (and certainly not at an ever-increasing pace). And it may even be fair to cite that as a reason for the messaging strategy. But there are all sorts of motivations, turf wars, and simple bad decision making which are just as likely to be the real reason. Sir_Brizz This is very much right on. I think Occam's Razor does apply a bit here: the simplest explanation is simply that Google doesn't have (or at least hasn't had) a clear vision of their messaging strategy and split themselves in too many directions a few years ago when they bought Jibe. Essentially, bad decision making over the past 2-3 years if not as far back as when Hangouts was announced. IMO part of the issue is that Hangouts started getting feature bloat, and adding things like chat bots to it was probably not possible, or at least caused enough problems that they didn't want to. Hangouts Chat looks like a fundamental rewrite probably as was Allo. These represent the future concerns of a Google messaging strategy. Expect chat bots to make up a major part of that over the next couple of years. My personal frustration is simply the fact that Google doesn't have one messaging platform that is competitive with one single competing messaging platform. All of their solutions together aren't, either. Monetarily it doesn't make sense for them to live so far behind the curve on something that has been increasingly becoming a fundamental function of the markets they are trying to survive within. t_newt It is not just about money--it is also about people. I get the feeling all the drama we hear rumors about, and the result of people leaving at the top of the company, has created a vacuum of leadership, and powerful people move quickly to fill that vacuum. Innovative companies that start letting their accountants, lawyers, or even HR start running the company quickly lose their innovation, and if there is effective, innovative competition, they quickly lose their marketshare. The reason Google has a lot of customers (or, more accurately, lots of people using their products that they can sell to advertisers), is that Android provides a useful ecosystem. If they lose track of that, they will lose people and will lose advertisers. Saying that messaging has to be profitable by itself is like a car company saying that the car trunk has to be profitable. A CFO at GM can tell the trunk engineer "show me how this is making us money or take it out of the design!" I like Android products. They are useful in organizing my life. But if Google loses track of that, I will (reluctantly) switch to an iPhone. A CFO doesn't think that way, which is why the CFO should be an advisor, not a leader. I hope Google doesn't become the next MySpace. headpiece747 This article was making me think of something that I hope Android Police would write about. What is the best messaging app with sms? I have been a die hard Hangout user since I have been on Android and never used nothing else. Would like a comparison of each. I am stuck using sms because everyone at work is on different platforms (ios, android and flip phone no joke) and they won't all go to one chat app like whatsapp or allo even though I haven't used either one. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages since it allows me to send/receive from anyone, whether they are on Android/iOS/Windows, or using a smart/dumb phone. Adrien Aubel Please try out invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi). It's an app that we're making, that is quite new and trying to solve specifically the problem you're talking about, transparently bringing IM when both people have the app. Another great option is Textra, more customization (we're about to ship significant changes though), although it doesn't support IM and even though they initially talked about supporting RCS I believe they gave up. We're actively talking with both Google and Samsung to be on top of it. Would love to get your feedback! Maybe try both? MeCampbell30 There is a lot wrong with this article and a few questionable journalism decisions. "In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line." Even in an editorial it's generally best to avoid assertions that could be considered borderline defamatory unless you have evidence or facts to support it. Perhaps the author does, but it isn't made clear in the body of the article. I also have to say the explanation about the law on fiduciary duties, shareholder derivative actions (lawsuits on behalf of the corporation), and the actual practice of Wall Street law firms is not accurate. I wrote more on reddit but an editor should go back and double check the sourcing on those statements. Also, typically, at least with organizations I'm familiar with, it's the job of a project manager to submit a proposal to the project management office (PMO) to get funding approval for big changes or more developer time. For even larger changes, it goes to an executive committee. The CFO is typically part of that committee (sometimes depending on expertise) but the day to day of the CFO is usually regulatory (complying with SEC, CFTC, import, ect. regulations and managing all of alphabets various accounts globally). At a company like Google it would be staffed by hundreds of people all around the world. As far as the logical thrust of the article, its not very consistent. RCS doesn't really provide a new income stream for Google. Nor does Googles noble effort to improve Android Messages. From a financial point of view, it would be more worthwhile to have a greater share of high spending users (attracted by a cohesive messaging system) than it would be to have more information on less spendy users (or more clickthroughs from those users). Brett Amen. I wrote a similar response before seeing yours: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah Trevor Newman Not sure it was borderline defamatory. It was a simile describing the generalized thought process of generalized people hired to ensure the financial success of a company. I do appreciate your thoughtful explanation of the project funding approval process (not being facetious). I understand that many companies have a tiered approval process with dollar amount thresholds granting certain persons the authority to authorize funding. My statements were meant to infer that business cases generally require a financial upside to receive funding, whether that is by the PMO or the CFO. While I am not positive that Allo required approval of the CFO, that was not the point of the article. It was meant as an opinion piece, not a scholarly treatise on Google. Just wanted​ to remind people that Google is a company and that they are subject to the same pressures as any other business. John Marshall’s Ghost Just FYI, this obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability. is not true. Fiduciary duty does not require anyone to increase. It merely requires a company to not engage in fraud, self-dealing or other instances that basically amount to theft, embezzlement, etc. This is a misconception that has gone hand in hand with the maxim of "maximizing shareholder value." It's wrong and please stop perpetuating the myth. Profits are subject to business decisions and business decisions that do not result in profit are not actionable in court absent a finding of fraud, self-dealing, etc. Source: Corporate attorney Yu Ping Hu It's not just that fiduciary duty wouldn't require maximized or increased profitability; there IS NO FIDUCIARY DUTY of a corporation to its shareholders. https://www.nixonpeabody.com/en/ideas/articles/2017/03/13/massachusetts-high-court-rules-that-public-company-directors-owe-fiduciary-duty-to-corporation John Marshall’s Ghost There is a fiduciary duty because officers and employees can't self-deal. Also, you liked a case from MA. There are 50 states plus federal law. That means 51 sets of laws. In NY officers owe a fiduciary duty to shareholders. But that duty does not require the maximization of shareholder value. MeCampbell30 You're misreading that. First, that is not a uniform rule among all states. Alphabet is a Delaware corporation, not a Massachusetts one. Second, there is little practical difference. A corporation's officers have a fiduciary duty to the owners (either the shareholders outright or their representatives on the board of directors). This rule is mostly procedural in that it acts as a bar on cases that tend to have less merit. MeCampbell30 Also an attorney in finance. I wrote as much in my post. Brett Yup. See my similar response: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah David Ruddock Thanks for the insight here. I've removed the section on fiduciary duty pending some more discussion of this internally. Appreciate everyone who pointed this out - we don't want to mislead anyone here, and a note has been placed in the relevant section. John Marshall’s Ghost I just have to comment that that was very responsible of you and commendable. Thank you for doing that. The whole "maximizing shareholder value" is required by law is a huge pet peeve of mine. Responses like this are why I trust AP. Jason Brown Given the more-more-more with less-less-less approach of modern news media, I'm astounded they have the time to monitor reader feedback. John Marshall’s Ghost It shows the quality of AP. Over the years, as an Android fan, I've whittled my Android news down to AP because of things exactly like this. Christopher Bement This is the biggest reason I read AP every day if my life. You guys have a fucking scary commitment to integrity and I love that. extesy You only have to look at Amazon for specific examples: zero profit for 15+ years, as decided by Jeff Bezos. Trevor Newman You are right, I misstated that it was a legal obligation. The black letter text defining fiduciary duty in Delaware state law, where Google is incorporated, does not list increasing profitability as a fiduciary duty owed by a corporation to its shareholders. However, like any statutory language, it possesses ambiguity and it is open to interpretation. Case law on the matter suggests that legal opinions are admittedly mixed. However, courts have interpreted the language of the fiduciary duty to include maximizing the economic value of the company, and by extension its shareholders. I based my intentionally hyperbolic statement on the basis on court opinions like the following written by Justice Chandler, formerly of the Delaware Court of Chancery: “Having chosen a for-profit corporate form, the craigslist directors are bound by the fiduciary duties and standards that accompany that form. Those standards include acting to promote the value of the corporation for the benefit of its stockholders. The "Inc." after the company name has to mean at least that. Thus, I cannot accept as valid for the purposes of implementing the Rights Plan a corporate policy that specifically, clearly, and admittedly seeks not to maximize the economic value of a for-profit Delaware corporation for the benefit of its stockholders—no matter whether those stockholders are individuals of modest means[106] or a corporate titan of online commerce. If Jim and Craig were the only stockholders affected by their decisions, then there would be no one to object. eBay, however, holds a significant stake in craigslist, and Jim and Craig's actions affect others besides themselves.” - Ebay Domestic Holdings, Inc. v. Newmark Civil Action No. 3705-CC. Court of Chancery of Delaware It was never my intention for this to be a legal opinion and I do appreciate you calling this out as it was also not my intention to mislead. I also appreciate David's swift action in removing that portion so as to also not perpetuate the misstatement. I will be sure to avoid this kind of “absolute” language when describing matters such as that. John Marshall’s Ghost Thank you for your response. This is the hallmark of professionalism. Typically, I wouldn't say anything but this is a) my wheelhouse and b) the whole "maximize shareholder value" is a pet peeve of mine because people think it's law when it's not and that has been the basis of 35+ years of failed economic policy (i.e., trickle down economics) and the justification for offshoring jobs. But, thank you again for the response. I thought your article was very well written and I hope this didn't come across as critical. I have done this to the NY Times, The Atlantic and various other organizations. Yours is the only article that has ever responded appropriately. Keep up the good work! 4Ui812 Sorry for your loss Cuba https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7396d722df5e3e069a320bcb2bded5cf4f113d3dc4d757cf83ec05f4c0c39f4f.gif John That makes no sense whatsoever. Google for Android forced everyone to use Assistant. It could have done the same for Hangouts. Or at least offered it as an option without creating a bunch of separate products, losing Hangouts users, and losing the ability to monetize on the desktop. Moreover, SMS, while not ideal, can still be analyzed and monetized if it's used within a Google app. By informing users that not all features are available without carrier RCS support, it would have put pressure on carriers to add support. I.e., Hangouts user base could have been used to promote RCS. NoNotTellingYou Fantastic article. There really is a madness behind the madness. Anthony Maki Well written! I think this makes a very compelling case. What about Duo, though? Hard to make revenue from E2E-encrypted video/audio. David Ruddock Probably just to couple it up to Allo as a value-add if you ask me. I think the two are destined only to become more tightly integrated - if Allo succeeds. If Allo doesn't, then Duo doesn't have to die alongside it. Sir_Brizz The article essentially heads off the "value-add" argument, though. Why would they have one value-add app and not another? David Ruddock I won't pretend to have all the answers here, and I agree, it's not exactly clear why Duo exists. I was offering a potential explanation, though I admit it's not rock solid. Sir_Brizz I'll be honest, the article leaves me sitting here more confused than resolute about what is going on :) Adrien Aubel App developers will be able to integrate with Duo although it'll be more of a button that opens the app full screen. They almost did that with Hangouts but eventually didn't. Like you I could see this popping up in the dialer (although RCS is coming up), messages, and possibly any other Google app. Nick Felker I wonder how Google will respond to this article. It hits very hard into their reasoning and I imagine it will rustle a few engineers. Suicide_Note They won't say a peep. They never do. Adrien Aubel They do read it, at least their execs do. Although for them, whenever they write publicly online, it suggests that they write the opinion of Google as a company, even if it was probably their own, so they're not as free as you or me. But whenever I bring up something I saw online that wasn't officially public yet they're like "Where? Android Police? Probably." Lateef Alabi-Oki Projects now have to be approved by Porat? Hmmm... not too sure about that. From what I've heard the culture at Google is heavily anti-suit. I don't think Larry or Sergey will go for that. I know Porat is reigning back on moonshots, but I hear even she has to thread a thin line. And before you say, "Google is a publicly traded company...shareholders...blah blah blah." Google has been a publicly traded company for almost two decades, and Larry and Sergey have publicly told shareholders to go fuck themselves on several occasions. Google at a fundamentally level is a company that just doesn't care about shareholders. And while Porat may have been hired to try to instill financial discipline at the company, I don't think it will ever be at the expensive of the engineering ethos of Google. Messaging is a value-add to a platform. It's not a revenue generating endeavor. I doubt any monetization from messaging will shift the needle at Google. The messaging fiasco at Google is the result of a lack of vision, mismanagement, and bad leadership. Google just never took messaging seriously until it was too late, and Facebook started kicking its ass. Holla Is it still not common in US that everybody uses Whatsapp? Gabriel Macys Does it support SMS? Because I have zero interest in shilling apps on my friends and family unless it supports a cross-platform communication standard. Adrien Aubel We're building an iMessage-like app for Android that has 2 main goals: - Try to solve texting on Android (interestingly we're quite close to Google and meet with them regularly) - Bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages being plain text. A bar suggests relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps them make their messages more personal (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. If any enthusiast person wants to try it out, I'd love to receive brutally honest feedback: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi (it's US only for a couple more weeks though, sorry) AP won't really talk about us but to be fair they've heard about us from previous iterations as well, before we recoded the whole app with a different dev team etc. ipsofact I will download and test the state of the art technology. Although I have a few ideas myself. Lets connect and talk Adrien Aubel Sounds good :) I don't mind sharing with you part of our roadmap and exchange over it. We're in some way trying to bridge the gap between SMS and IM hassle-free, while bridging the gap between texting and Snapchat. ipsofact Sent you a linkedin request. Thanks Mike I'm very interested in this app and just downloaded it! Any chance of RCS being added to it in the future? Adrien Aubel We absolutely want that! We're actively talking to both Google and Samsung. Google is shy sharing their client and some technical details. It may not be stable or documented enough, but they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more interested actively contributing but we're still in early talks. Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to! Actively talking with the relevant people at Google and Samsung. Google is a bit shy sharing their client or technical details. It may be not as stable or documented as they want before sharing externally, and they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more actively collaborating but we're still in early talks. Can't wait to have another technology to transparently upgrade our users to when available :) Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to!

Adrien Aubel We wanted to focus on making a good product for the US before opening it to everybody. But we're revamping right now our support system and allowing a manual IM registration (Americans are automatically verified) to allow us to offer our features to other countries, and we're about to translate our materials and app, while giving multi-language to the Awesome Bar, to make it more relevant. We hope to be opened internationally within the next 3 weeks, will keep you informed! ipsofact LOL I was in a group messaging with 4 other iphones. 1 android. iMessage & RCS do not play well... Wesley Da’Nomad WhatsApp? How about some love for Signal? freshprince_87 What about loving the invi app instead. It's basically iMessage for Android Rod No messaging service can compete with Whatsapp's user base. Maybe WeChat. Isaac Fischer So, just so we're clear between this post and the last one: Trevor's official job function is to be the disgruntled malcontent who kinda likes Android but doesn't really like Google? He's "mansplaining" to us why we're sheeple? 🙃 Trevor Newman I actually love Google. I wish they made a single messaging app but I've come to terms with the fact that as long as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger have billions of users between them and my family clings to Skype for video chatting...a single Google messenger would just be one more on the pile. People think I don't like Google but it's just not true. Mostly I'm just trying to understand them. Ben The problem is, Allo has catastrophically failed to collect any data because the Google nerds (essentially the entire readership of this site) were the only ones that downloaded the app. Given that, it's highly likely Allo is a massive net loss for Alphabet. Google's messaging strategy is simply not working from a financial or practical perspective while Facebook is flying ahead. This is might be a sign of a company trying to live up to its fiduciary duties, but failing at them on the messaging front. Christopher Robert Not a fan of Facebook Messenger, out of all of the ones on the market it violates privacy the worst of all of them. If you know anyone who works in digital advertising just ask them. Facebook sells your most private conversations as marketing meat to the highest bidder. Ben I honestly don't care too much but your comment is totally unrelated to my point. Christopher Robert Please explain to me why you "Honestly don't care" that Facebook reads all of your messages. I am not trying to be rude just curious how anyone could be okay with that. It's so out there to me that I have a hard time understanding how people are just okay with there private conversations being read by completely strangers. Ben Because my messages really aren't that secret and I know there's not a Facebook employee personally reading all my messages but rather they're just being used to target ads to me. Christopher Robert I'll bet you money there is a FB employee who reads messages. There is no way 100% of the messages are handled without any human oversight. Wolf0491 Yeah my buddy got the hangouts update other day removing his SMS and he told me he is uninstalling it and to use normal text now to get in touch because two apps is obnoxious. I don't blame him. Christopher Robert I was thinking this same thing, but was really hoping it was just a paranoid delusion. Is anyone actually okay with letting Google or anyone read all of their private chat messages. It is exactly for this reason that I can't get on board with Allo. If they end up shutting down Hangouts for non gapps users I will be switching over to Signal PRivate messaging along with most of my contacts. Google Give users what they want and they stay loyal and then you make money. Going after profits first just drives away users to find companies who are willing to listen to them. Hernán Guerra It seems you are under the assumption that Allo messages are not encrypted and Hangouts messages are, which is incorrect. RNTMPX Totally agree with your opinion! 2 Men-E If RCS would just be fully adopted by all US carriers, and designated OEMs...Google would see a massive increase in "Android Messages" usage. Sir_Brizz Probably not, because it's not the default SMS app on many OEM phones. Adrien Aubel I think they actually did a decent job on that end, shipping the app on more OEMs and carriers, they've spent so many endless meetings on this. I just hope that they'll let more easily app developers integrate with the technology to let their users benefit from a stronger RCS usage. kalehv And yet, even if that happened, most probably only be in North America. The world is beyond carrier-based-messaging now and won't look back IMO. bekifft Spot on assessment. For me it raises the question then, when does the damage being done outweigh the direct pursuit of the bottom line? No one is adopting their messaging platforms because they are too little, too late. At this point it's seeming more like outright hostility / incompetence from Google than anything. Spoonie The cost savings in not having to continuously update and run multiple apps by producing and maintaining one messaging app would probably be a very compelling business case; the increase in uptake and usage of the Allo app if SMS or RCS were add would also look very good on paper. I'm not sure this article is really on the money with the conclusions you have made. Po Lite Uninstall Hangouts and install use built in messenger how does that help google? I refuse to go anywhere with google messaging anymore cant trust it will be around next year. This is also making me look at Gmail and getting away from that. Its upsetting to be treated this way. None of these apps are free in the sense they get us to use the google eco system buy apps subscribe to google play music and google drive. but constantly ripping apps away that we like is a real drag. so H-Allo Spotify , Office 365 , I will stick with android and Messaging - Mail - and install every ad blocker / Firewall I can find. I will pay for apps not ads and by having me then constantly change my apps ( I have a whole bunch of friends that are going to hate me on May 22 ) I am paying for it. I cut the cable now its time to cut google. They now seem to be inline on how apple operates. Not sure how to dump YouTube ( cant ) Google ( Alphabet ) should change their name to YouTube thats all they are to me now. I am done. If I am forced to try something different then ............................ Ms. Porat shame shame shame. How is this taxing the rich. ( the rich is Google ) .... Just as greedy as anyone. Lets see how fun it is to work for Google over the next few years now that they have a new bottom line financial boss. Craig Nelson Apple will eventually open iMessage to android much like blackberry did with BBM. Apple is a business too and iMessage makes them money so eventually they will want to increase to even more profits and will expand the app. As for Google, I lost hope for them after the disappointing Allo. Oh well Sir_Brizz It's doubtful they will ever do that as iMessage is a huge selling point to their devices. JD They won't and don't need to do it. They went the other way made SMS available on all Mac products as long as you have an iPhone. DoctorRabbitfoot As much as I hate it - Facebook has Messenger figured out. Its pretty usable on every platform, even a web browser, they keep adding fun things that are "sticky", and in most social circles, Facebook is a constant. If they ever add SMS fall back....wow. I've used it for friends groups, co-workers, and sports teams. I know someone will come here and tell me how their social circle doesn't apply or Facebook is the devil, blah blah. I get it, you are a fringe case. Facebook is hugely popular and their messenger is doing really well in the States. No idea how it is outside of the country, but well, thats why they bought Whatsapp (maybe?) TheZiltoid Messaging is super important to me messaging my friends and co-workers (who all use iPhones). I hate to say it but I may have to make the switch to iOS. I'm due for an upgrade too. Was looking forward to getting the Pixel. Ugh... Martin I think If they did one of them right, like iMessage and selling stickers and other BS to dumb people who use them, they would make more money... :) Michael Hazell I honestly don't want companies to be trying to harvest my SMS messages in the same way that companies try to harvest messages in general, like Google with harvesting email messages. I'm just using the "stock" SMS app in Lineage OS at this point, because I can no longer use Hangouts, which I've been doing ever since KitKat. It's a shame that they've gone this far in this ridiculous suite of messaging apps. The good news is that a lot of folks, at least around me, either use SMS or Facebook Messenger. The more Google can't keep themselves straight on what they do, the more they look inferior to other platforms. I'd like universal RCS to be a thing with carriers, sooner rather than later. I'm kinda sick of the whole notion of companies profiting via message apps. At least with carriers they're regulated to an extent when it comes to handling information and what they can do with it; these other companies aren't. abc "In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity." It's never been an issue for them before, it's practically what they do. JD Done and done. Move to iOS and use Whatsapp. To hell with Hangouts and Google. YuCMi I chose to give Google the middle finger and use Signal instead. I don't need Assistant in my messages, and I want my conversations private. fonix232 I'd argue slightly with this. While it definitely makes sense that Google does this for business, what makes more sense is that they're separating messaging services to separate apps because of the trust/monopoly lawsuits and allegations that popped up recently in Europe. To make it more clear: Android has an open-source SMS app. Play Services packages Google's own messaging app (let's call it X for simplicity), which can do SMS, Hangouts, RCS, Allo, Duo, et cetera. It's an all in one solution. As it is part of the GPS package (GPS being Google Play Services here), it would be installed on most, if not all phones, by default. Manufacturers, such as Samsung, modify the AOSP apps (theming, adding features when deemed necessary, etc.). Google of course won't add X features to the AOSP app, partly because of licensing/proprietary bits, and partly because, why should they? Samsung/Sony/Huawei/OnePlus/LG take the AOSP source, theme the default app, but do not touch it much since there's an already working and complete solution by Google that WILL ship with the device, which means nobody will really use the AOSP app, so there's no point working on it. This means that the overall best app to use any/all mobile messaging services will be the only one developed by Google. Which ships with most/all phones. And we got a nice Internet Explorer case on our hands. Something that Google wants to avoid. Hence, they break up the solutions into separate bits that manufacturers can (optionally) replace with their own solution. Want a proprietary chat solution? Replace Hangouts/Allo! Want SMS and RCS? Replace messaging! Want 1-on-1 video calls? Replace Duo! DragoCubed It doesn't justify why Allo can't run on all platforms purely through the web like hangouts or telegram. Michael Payton Another option: just use the native texting app that already comes with your phone and ignore everything else. I do not use Allo or any of the other Google or 3rd party messaging apps, including Facebook Messenger and yet, somehow my life carries on. I still manage to communicate with everyone that I need to. Bruce Wayne Right. Peterson Silva You're ignoring one part of the equation: for the guy who's talking to the CFO to convince her to create Allo he'd have to show a profit motive, right? But what profit can come out of a product no one uses? Because that ship's sinking. Wouldn't it make more sense to first build the user base and then present assistant? And for that first thing to be done right a more cohesive, all-in-one approach would be better, I guess. blueman24 1. Google should make Android Message's a part of g suite. 2. For me, having 2 apps is OK but Allo having all the functionality like proper desktop support and universal chat backup (*cough* hangouts *cough*) is far more important. Rod WhatsApp is already the world standard for messaging. Google's services don't make any difference. Rod Sometimes I'm actually glad WhatsApp is the go-to app for messaging, worldwide (except the US). John Edwards Good article. I definitely lost sight of he business aspect...Makes more sense that it doesn't make sense. Hridja Tripathi One of the most insightful articles i've read. Thanks David This was a really good article. I have been using an iPhone for two months now and iMessage has been one of the bright spots when using it. If you don't have an iPhone you get a regular text but if you do you get all new ways of messaging whether it be with games or all the other stuff Allo offers as well. The point is that it works and I'm hoping Google can eventually get to that point. I won't hold my breath though. Timmy Turner Great write up! Couldn't have said it better myself. Soda Nebula Android is all about customization, personalization and options. Since when is that a problem? I always think its wrong when people want a ubiquitious standard for android to be like fb or iphone. Why cant they 'fix' hangouts? Because it alienates those who like it as is, when it was going to be built from the ground up anyways. Imagine all the confused old people who wake up and theyre unable to use basic text functions because its different without warning. Inb4 muh integrations Tomás O’Mertà How do you get from "most of the world has moved on from SMS" to "SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada"? Do you have figures to support this, or are you revealing a bias when you say "Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS"? Ed Malcolm Great article. But as a 52 yo, tech semi-savi, Nexus 5x, project fi user; I'm NEVER going to use any texting app but the what's behind the icon at bottom right of my home screen. Whatsapp?? What's that?!? Hangouts?? I'd hang up. If can't send a text to ANYONE with a cell phone- I ain't using it. I use Slack for work. Know why? There are a select group of people I must communicate with, but not all of whom I want to have my phone number- Privacy. l always choose the highest privacy settings, not because I don't want anyone to know what I'm saying or where I'm at, but I just don't I want to see ads as a result. So this article did was show me that I'll pay for not having ads. I'd pay an extra $5 a month to eliminate ads. Maybe I'm an iPhone guy after all. Who knew? drorharari Trevor, you miss the point just like the Google folks. I, as much of the Android and iOS ecosystem already have WhatsApp and many also have Facebook Messenger and other messaging apps like Skype, Hangouts, etc. There is no incentive for me to try Allo as no one I know uses it and on the have if it, no value proposition (for me, not for Google) is evident. So the question then boils down to "does Google care about me using Allo at all?" because if it doesn't then why should we bother. On the other hand, if Google does care about people using Allo then they should act this way. SMS support is not what Google strives to offer in Allo but it is the only sure way to get people on board. Had Google made Allo the replacement to Android Messenger, people would have had no real reason not to use it, moreover, it would have been the default (just like IMessage is in iOS). Then Allo would have been able to automatically switch to RCS or to their own protocol when they detect the other side also have Allo (currently and extremely unlikely event but being the Android's default, that would have been a rather likely event). Hence, and contrary to your theory, I and most others are getting the (probably correct) message that Google does not care much about messaging and there's no real reason to bother with it. It will be gone in a quarter or two like many trial balloons Google had floated in the past. Michael Oghia Fascinating. Thanks for this! kalehv I think the whole point of Allo supporting SMS fallback is only relevant in North America where people still use SMS. Rest of the world doesn't care about SMS at all. Almost all of my friends using iPhones use WhatsApp as de facto messaging app. they care the least about iMessage. cyc Is iMessage seriously reason enough for people to buy iPhones?!? Jeez... Also, hangouts is or was way more advanced than any other IM platform: it was only truly multiplatform, connected to your Gmail not your mobile number, with great video conferencing. Kirk Broadhurst If the "bottom line" is the only thing that mattered, they'd have improved Hangouts. It's far riskier - in terms of user base - to start a new app. And without users there's no "bottom line" improvement. Mathieu Laflamme You should add to the list YouTube since you can now chat in it (maybe only in Canada yet)! And Google+ plus too because sharing a post to one person is pretty much sending a message... D.Smithee I've got a friend who I thought was Android for life--and then he tried iOS and could never leave iMessage..or at least that's the way he explains it. As for all these messaging apps--I just choose the one that has everyone I know on it...Facebook Messenger. Marti Abernathey Eh. What you're saying makes sense if users move from the old Google messaging apps to the new. I've been a Hangouts/Google user since the beginning. I'm now using Textra/WhatsApp for messaging. Google messaging apps are just less elegant and more fragmented. Why would I use them? I don't mind being data mined if you're giving me something. But I personally don't see the value here. Markoff the article doesn't make sense: 1. what's cost benefit splitting Allo hand Duo into two apps? 2. what's cost benefit developing Messenger/Android Messages separately from Allo? mattman723 Tbh I don't mind multiple platforms, I just tell people I'm accessible through any and all methods. I only hate that you cannot "leave" a group SMS. Jadephyre Most people I know that use an iPhone exclusively use Whatsapp, except when needing to send an SMS to people not using any form of smartphone. James Briano Google has no coherent messaging strategy. Their internal teams are either competing with each other, or simply not communicating (maybe they should all get WhatsApp). Recall Google insiders bragging that the Pixel was designed in complete isolation from the Android team. That's nothing to brag about—that's a problem. scy breaking news is a business, of course what it does is about making money, what business isn't? Railwayman Some interesting theories here. One thing I have a hard time to understand is this logic: "SMS fallback is not supported because Google doesn't make money off SMS" - OK, they don't make any more money from SMS even with a separate client. So if that would be the case, then they would just use the basic AOSP SMS client with absolutely no frills (just the barebones). Since we are talking Google/Alphabet it is a bit hard to see how it can bring "more revenue" to have a lot of different messaging apps. It is one thing that we have WhatsApp, Viber, Skype etc since it is... different companies and they want your money but here we have one company. I just fail to see how it can bring more revenue when you use Google Allo instead of Google Hangouts. Or using Google Duo instead of Google Hangouts. Or... IF there would be any kind of "sensible business" here - i.e. that "many messaging apps=increased revenue" then we would see other companies following suit. I.e. WhatsApp Messenger, WhatsApp Trio, WhatsApp Friends&Family, WhatsApp GetTogether, WhatsApp Connect and so on - IF we buy into the thesis that "many messaging apps=increased revenue". Yet... we don't see this kind of strategy from the competition. Apple, which care a lot about their revenues would also have a couple of different messengers *if* there would be a strong business case here. I can't believe for a second that they would just keep iMessage and FaceTime if there would be a compelling business case of having a couple of other options. To recap: It doesn't make any business sense to develop a lot of different apps from *the same company* for the very basic thing of "messaging". A more appropriate strategy is to make *one* major service and to make it really good. It is actually pretty simple and no excuses about "business cases with many messengers" change it even a little bit. Android need: Android Messenger Description: Android Messenger is the default messaging client in the Android OS. It supports SMS (carrier and Google Voice), RCS and Android Messages instant messages (based off Hangouts). It automatically select Android Messages when the recipient has AM on their device, otherwise RCS with SMS fallback. All messages are automatically backed up to the cloud and integrated with Gmail. The user can setup Android Messenger using their SIM based number, GV number or Gmail address and it is done when the setup guide is running on first boot unless the account is configured already. Android Messenger work on smartphones, tablets and computers - every device that can sign in to a Gmail account is compatible since AM is part of Gmail. When you setup Gmail you simply get AM as well. Android Messenger is the standard client on Android devices shipped with G-Apps and is also the basic part of every G-App package. Android Messenger can be plugged in with a dialer tab for Google Voice accounts and is also seamlessly integrated with the Contacts app. I.e. all messages goes through AM. This would make sense and bring a viable competitor to iMessage. Explanations along the lines of "the business case of having several messages", "the carriers don't like default messaging apps", "Samsung doesn't like default messaging apps" and so on are just... excuses for a messed up system. Google can roll out Android Messenger for the simple reason that they have a dominating platform. What should the carrier do? Every Android device has AM so... their only option then would be to sell iPhone only BUT... they can't put their own client on there EITHER. So should they go back to selling feature phones? And Samsung? Telling Google that they are going to use Tizen if they can't put their own SMS client on? Especially now when they accepted GPM as their music player. I can say this: No OEM or carrier are going to stop using or selling Android because Google roll out Android Messenger in O or P. It is not exactly that way that we are going to see a "mass exodus" from the platform because they decided to integrate AM. If anyone seriously believe that Android is commonplace because the messaging app can be replaced by either "OEM Messenger" or "Carrier Messenger" I must recommend a reality check. And no, I don't think there will be any platform suddenly getting traction because "we hate instant messengers and we boycott Android but embrace new platform X because we can replace its messaging client". Especially not today when the carriers offer "unlimited texting". So Google can create a unified Android Messenger and push it on all devices without any problems with boycott or mass exodus of partners and carriers. The question is rather if they are able to assemble all their different teams and merge them in order to create Android Messenger. One thing is for sure: They have a lot to gain and very little to loose since such a client would get a lot of traction at the expense of WhatsApp and the likes by being integrated and the default option. Immediately when there are two devices with O or P for example everything is just... set and the messages are heading down the Google street. So if Google want to maximize revenue from messages, then this is the way to go - especially with Assistant integration. Michael Sørensen "most of the world has moved on from SMS" But has it though? I know SMS usage is down and still falling, but is it really that much down? Certainly not where I live (Europe). Matt This seems like a lot of words to say "They abandoned Hangouts because it was easier to build something from the ground up that they could mine data from." It also doesn't really put forth an evidence that it would be easier to build a new app, nor does it provide any real argument why the replacement wouldn't be more cohesive. snowglyder Good write-up. As I agree with all your points, it doesn't help Google if their users no longer trust whether they'll keep a service or not. Speaking for myself, I recently bailed on all Google messaging platforms for Signal and SMS. The SMS removal from Hangouts did it for me, and it seems like others too. It's no easy feat to get your friends/family to move messaging platforms, so continuing with Google for messaging wasn't a moving target I wanted to pursue. I recently got the S8 and stayed with using Samsung's Messages app, as it works over WiFi. I noticed that if the other person is using their Messages app for SMS also, you get read receipts, delivery notification, and can see when they're typing. iMessage-like. Good enough!

You’ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You’re all set! Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it Ajit Pai, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. (Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg) By Ron Wyden, Al Franken and Tom Wheeler By Ron Wyden, Al Franken and Tom Wheeler April 26 at 5:16 PM Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, and Al Franken, a Democrat from Minnesota, are members of the U.S. Senate. Tom Wheeler was FCC chairman from 2013 to January. For as long as the Internet has existed, it has been grounded on the principle of net neutrality — that what you read, see or watch online shouldn’t be favored, blocked or slowed down based on where that content is coming from. Net neutrality means that cable companies can’t reserve the fastest Internet speeds for the biggest companies and leave everyone else in the slow lane. That’s what ensures a website for a local pizza place in rural Oregon or Minnesota loads as quickly as the website for Pizza Hut or Domino’s. Or why a social network built in a garage is available to the same people as Instagram or Twitter. That’s why it’s so alarming to see that the Federal Communications Commission, a federal agency that’s expected to help protect the Internet, is planning to roll back net neutrality rules. In the past few months, President Trump’s new FCC chairman, Ajit Pai, has already abandoned other important consumer protections: He backed out of a proposal to free people from having to rent expensive cable boxes, and he is trying to make it harder for low-income families to access affordable high-speed Internet. It’s amazing that Trump, having promised to stand up to the powerful on behalf of ordinary Americans, now has an FCC that gives the powerful what they ask for — even if it hurts consumers. So with powerful forces pushing to get rid of net neutrality — Comcast, AT&T, Verizon and other multibillion-dollar companies — it’s going to take Americans speaking up to protect the Internet that we depend on. In 2014, nearly 4 million Americans contacted the FCC, with an overwhelming majority sending a very simple message: protect net neutrality. And as a result of those efforts, we got policies put in place to do just that. But now those very policies are on the chopping block. Unless people fight back, these deep-pocketed corporations will upend how we get our news, watch our favorite shows, use social media or run our businesses. Net neutrality is good for consumers, small businesses and rural America. It creates jobs, especially at small businesses. The software that runs agricultural tools, the point-of-sale operating systems in our restaurants, the newest idea from a dorm room or a garage — all function in an Internet ecosystem that is equal and won’t allow Big Cable and others to prioritize one piece of Internet traffic over another. Net neutrality also allows small businesses to compete against the largest, most profitable corporations. Here’s just one example. In 2005, three guys set up shop above a pizzeria in a strip mall in San Mateo, Calif., where they launched the now-ubiquitous YouTube. Video-sharing websites were in their infancy, but these guys already faced competition from something called Google Video. Because of net neutrality, YouTube was able to contend with Google on a level playing field. Internet service providers treated YouTube’s videos the same as they did Google’s, and Google couldn’t pay the ISPs to gain an unfair advantage, like a fast lane into consumers’ homes. Well, it turned out that people liked YouTube a lot more than Google Video, so YouTube thrived. In fact, in 2006, Google bought YouTube for $1.65 billion. Small businesses shouldn’t have to outbid massive conglomerates just to get their product in front of consumers’ eyes. If net neutrality is gutted, only the biggest conglomerates will be able to pay for the fastest Internet speeds. In many ways, it’s our small, innovative, next-generation businesses that have the most to lose. This isn’t just about high-tech innovation, though. The Internet is absolutely critical for rural communities. Access to high-speed Internet in rural areas supports jobs and businesses, of course, but it also affects things such as education and health care. Now, because of the Internet, our rural areas are better-connected than ever. Yes, there are still huge access gaps, but those gaps will become impossible to fill if we don’t protect the principles that have already made the Internet a driver of innovation and economic prosperity. Big Cable and other opponents of net neutrality will try to argue that getting rid of these protections will somehow actually help consumers. Or they’ll argue that you can have an open Internet without net neutrality. That defies evidence and common sense. The best way to protect consumers and small businesses on the Internet is to preserve net neutrality. And the only way to preserve net neutrality is to join together to speak out and fight back against this latest attack on the open Internet.

Check these samples Huawei P10, P10 Plus to hit SA next month, pricing in tow Android / Google files ‘smart drag and drop’ patent for Android By Hadlee Simons on 25 April, 2017 Drag and drop functionality is a pretty standard feature on today’s computers, allowing you to easily share documents, images and other files between windows. However, a new patent by Google hints at a similar feature coming to Android. Discovered by What a Future, the patent calls for files and even selected bits of text to be shared between apps. So, one example is having a text conversation with a friend about dinner. The friend then suggests a restaurant (“The Rock”), allowing you to highlight the restaurant name. From here, you can drag the text, with a list of “droppable” apps popping up. Google’s example sees users dropping the text into a restaurant booking app, allowing you to quickly bring up the eatery details. Google is apparently working on a smart drag and drop feature for Android Another scenario described by Google is being able to take a photo of a landmark (or having it in your gallery), then dragging said photo into a maps app. From here, you’ll get directions to the landmark, if you’re not there already. Or you could drag the photo to an online storage app and get a URL for it. Interestingly enough, the patent also mentions that machine learning may play a part in all of this. Google says it could use machine learning to predict drop locations based on “past drag and drop operations”, for instance. The firm adds that the tech could also be used to determine when “The Rock” is the aforementioned restaurant, the actor or Alcatraz Island. “For example, the system may include a machine learning model that indicates when ‘the rock’ appears in the same sentence as ‘dinner’, the model indicates the entity referred to is the restaurant 85% of the time, or in other words the restaurant entity has a probability of 85%.” Will the feature make it in time for Android O? It’s anyone’s guess at this point, but a patent doesn’t mean the function is a done deal. Author Bio Terrible puns make Hadlee Simons difficult to work with, but he brings over seven years of tech journalism experience to the table. When he's not at work or watching motorsport, he's in the foetal position on a jiu jitsu mat. More RELATED Android O dev preview released: what’s new?

Digital Trends Home > Cars > Everything you need to know about Waymo’s… Everything you need to know about Waymo’s self-driving car project From Alphabet to Google, here's all you need to know about Waymo's self-driving car By Dallon Adams — April 26, 2017 1:55 PM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Although many of us believed we would have our own personal flying cars by the year 2017, that certainly hasn’t turned out to be the case. However, in the next couple of years, autonomous cars will become a regular part of our day-to-day experience. Instead of taking the wheels ourselves, fleets of self-driving cars will soon shuffle us around while we tend to more pressing issues, such as texting, napping, catching up on emails, or flipping through Tinder. What a time to be alive. One of the most promising players in this market is the newly revamped Waymo. There has been a wave of Waymo announcements over the past few months as the company inches closer to releasing its first commercially available autonomous vehicle. Here’s everything you need to know. What is Waymo? For most of the past decade, Google has poured a war chest of cash into its self-driving technology. The company notoriously pioneered robotic car laws nationwide, and built a massive fleet of driverless pods that eventually roamed around Silicon Valley. Nonetheless, Alphabet, Google’s parent company, eventually decided to overhaul the entire program. In 2016, Alphabet announced that Waymo would spearhead this autonomous driving project from that point forward. Rather than building the vehicles itself, Waymo would collaborate with auto manufacturers. This was a big first and a major pivot for the project as a whole. With the announcement, Waymo signaled a shift from further developing its pod vehicles. Investments in autonomous vehicle technologies have boomed in recent years. Major automakers like Ford and General Motors recently topped a Navigant Research study ranking the top 18 companies and their ability to develop self-driving cars. For perspective’s sake, Waymo was ranked seventh on the same list (the highest-ranked non-automaker). We elaborate more on this ravenous autonomous driving competition here. Streamlining production In January, at the North American Auto Show’s Automobili-D conference, Waymo CEO John Krafcik announced that Waymo built the entire sensor suite used by its self-driving Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid test vehicles. This was a huge step for the company for multiple reasons. First and foremost, this meant Waymo was no longer at the behest of multiple, third-party suppliers to create a single vehicle. Moving the production process in-house has enabled more efficient integration of the various components (sensor hardware, sensor fusion software, image recognition). For example, when the company first started testing its self-driving cars, the cost of a single high-end lidar system was $75,000; that number has since dropped by 90 percent. Who is Waymo working with? Chrysler Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid Again, with the Waymo transition and the demise of the Google pod cars, the company made one thing very clear: It had no intention of attempting to manufacture entire cars. In 2016, Waymo partnered with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles to better commercialize its self-driving vehicle technologies. The initial deal called for the conversion of 100 Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivans into prototype autonomous vehicles. To allow for the incorporation of the self-driving hardware, the minivans’ electrical systems, powertrains, and chassis were slightly modified. These prototypes have already been tested on location at Fiat Chrysler facilities in Chelsea, Michigan, Yucca, Arizona, and also at the Waymo facility in California. Honda could be next Acura RLX Sport Hybrid While the company has already partnered with Fiat Chrysler, Honda may be the next collaboration for Waymo. In December 2016, Honda announced that it was “entering into formal discussions” with Waymo to integrate the company’s autonomous tech with its cars. If this collaboration comes to fruition, we imagine it would be rather similar to the Fiat Chrysler partnership, with Honda providing a series of vehicles to be modified with the Waymo hardware. Honda has recently been dabbling with its own self-driving car tests, so a joint venture with Waymo would be a logical next step. The company has been testing prototype autonomous vehicles based on the RLX Sport Hybrid at the GoMentum Station in San Francisco. Honda hopes to manufacture vehicles with advanced autonomous capabilities around 2020. Public offerings In Arizona, Waymo is already offering the general public rides in their fleet of converted Pacifica Hybrids. Waymo also announced the delivery of 500 more prototype self-driving vehicles, many of which are headed to The Copper State. As part of this trial program, Waymo will grant certain Phoenix residents round-the-clock access to its autonomous offerings, per a report by Medium. What are Waymo’s ambitions with this project? The company hopes to use feedback from these trial riders to better understand how these vehicles hold-up in real-world scenarios, outside of the cozy confines of its test facilities. But why Arizona of all places? Chiefly because the state is one of a few areas in the country where it is legal to test autonomous vehicles on public roads. For this reason, both Uber and the General Motors self-driving vehicle subsidiary, Cruise Automation, also test their self-driving cars in Scottsdale. Competition As noted previously, Waymo is certainly not the only player in the burgeoning autonomous vehicle market. Ford has announced plans to launch its own self-driving vehicles for ride-sharing services by 2021. The Renault-Nissan Alliance, Daimler, and Volkswagen Group, among others, are also working to implement these technologies into commercial vehicles in the coming years. Uber has recently deployed a a fleet of self-driving cars in San Francisco, and General Motors recently divulged plans to test a series of self-driving cars in Michigan. It is important to note that Waymo recently filed a lawsuit against Uber, claiming that a former Waymo employee stole more than 14,000 files from the company. These files were then used to create a new autonomous driving startup called Otto. This company was later acquired by Uber for $680 million. Uber has since denied Waymo’s charges, dubbing them nothing more than “a baseless attempt to slow down a competitor.” You can read more about measures Waymo is taking to protect its secrets from Uber here.

The oldest of the infected apps could have been uploaded to Google Play as long ago as last November, having successfully remained hidden for five months, while the newest may have been uploaded as recently as the beginning of this month. The malware has infected nearly 50 guide apps for popular games, Check Point researchers Oren Koriat, Andrey Polkovnichenko & Bogdan Melnykov noted in an online post. Check Point alerted Google about the presence of the malware, and Google swiftly responded by removing the infected apps from its online app store, they said. The apps were submitted by two fake developer personas: "Sergei Vernik" and "Nikolai Zalupkin." The names may suggest a Russian connection to the malware, Koriat, Polkovnichenko & Melnykov acknowledged, but they also noted that "Zalupkin" would sound made-up to a native Russian speaker. The infected apps have the potential of being especially dangerous, they said, as FalseGuide could be utilizing a botnet for nefarious purposes -- ranging from the sending of adware to conducting a DDoS attack, or even as a way to penetrate a private network. These high levels are possible because the apps request device admin permission upon downloading. That is an unusual request, and it suggests malicious intent, as it prevents the user from deleting the app. FalseGuide registers itself to a Firebase Cloud Messaging topic with the same name as the app, which allows it to receive additional modules that then create a silent botnet. Game On The makers of the FalseGuide malware likely wanted it to masquerade as game guides, which are popular and actually build on the monetary success of their related apps. They require very little development time and are limited in feature implementations. "This FalseGuide Malware did a great job of deploying via a few apps users wanted, and when people granted it top administrative privileges during installation, the malware was planted pretty deeply," said Jim Purtilo, associate professor of computer science at the University of Maryland. One reason the infected apps have been able to fool users is that on the Android platform, "the security model is pretty much all-or-nothing on permissions," he told TechNewsWorld. "When you install an app, it will ask for access to the network, or your contacts, or any of several other kinds of resources -- and commonly, you can't install the app without agreeing," Purtilo said. "Sometimes what it asks for can raise a red flag. Why would a flashlight app need your contact lists? But unfortunately, the rationale for an app needing some service might not be clear, so even experienced users become lulled into agreeing without thinking," he added. "They just trust the source -- Google Play, in this case." False Positive Google so far has responded in the only way it can -- by removing the infected apps from Google Play. However, given that some of these guides date back to early November, it appears that the company clearly failed to protect its customers. "This is nasty, and maybe the best thing ever to happen for BlackBerry in recent memory," said Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group. "The reason is that FalseGuide is designed to provide elevated permissions for the external attacker, and automatically install additional malware modules including rootkits," he told TechNewsWorld. "Currently, only the Blackberry Android phones are designed to aggressively prevent this kind of attack," Enderle said. This malware "does represent a significant threat," he added, "because the phones can then be used to convey user identity information and execute DDoS attacks -- and could even be used to spy on users' activity using the phones' cameras and microphones." Rootkit of the Problem At this point there may be little users can do except reset their devices and be more cautious of what they download. However, those steps might not be enough to purge the malware. "Since this thing can apply a rootkit to your phone, even going back to the original settings by doing a full phone wipe may not eliminate the malware, so this could cost you a phone," warned Enderle. "These users are pretty well compromised now," said Purtilo. "It's a little awkward that this went undetected for so long at Google Play," he noted, "and in the ongoing cat-and-mouse game between creation and detection of digital pests, the malware creators still hold a strong lead. This won't change until we come up with more effective ways to help consumers make rational choices about what we agree to run on our devices." The problem in part is loss of trust -- especially as people expect Google Play to be vetted and safe, so their guard will be down. This is why some might not have caught on that a guide shouldn't need administrator rights. "This serves as a reminder to read the rights that every app asks for," said Enderle. "If those rights don't align with what the app does -- for instance, why would a guide need your contact list? -- or if the app asks for admin rights don't install it," he advised. "Given this is getting through Google vetting, and Apple doesn't talk about stuff like this," said Enderle, "it kind of makes you wonder if there is something similar on Apple phones that we either haven't discovered yet or that hasn't launched yet, suggesting that even Apple owners should keep their eyes open for this kind of an attack."

Google posts truly incredible night images captured by the Pixel and Nexus 6P Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/25 11:28am PDTApr 25, 2017 61 Plus 1 on G+ 452 Share on Facebook 107 Share on Twitter Total Shares620 Google News Nexus 6P Pixel Pixel XL Smartphone cameras have come a long way, but can you ever take images that rival a "real" camera? According to Google software engineer Florian Kainz, the answer is yes. Using a custom camera app and some post-capture editing , Kainz shows what the camera sensors in the Pixel and Nexus 6P can do in low light situations. Kainz says his little project was inspired by a chat with Google's Gcam team, which focuses on computational photography. The most visible Gcam contribution to Google's products is HDR+, which allows phones like the Pixel to take photos in dim lighting by combining as many as 10 burst shots. HDR+ isn't perfect, though. Sometimes there just isn't enough light to produce a good image. 64 4-second exposures, shot with Nexus 6P With long exposures and lots of individual images, Kainz reasoned it should be possible to get much better photos out of a smartphone's tiny camera sensor. To test this, he built a simple camera app with manual control over exposure time, ISO, and focus distance. The image at the top of the Point Reyes Lighthouse at night was Kainz's first test. This is a composite of 32 frames at 4-second exposure and ISO 1600, taken with the Nexus 6P. He also covered the lens and captured 32 completely black frames. The RAW image files were exported to Photoshop, where the mean of all 32 photos was computed, then the mean of the 32 black frames was subtracted. Below you can see what one of the individual HDR+ photos looked like. Impressive, no? A single 6P HDR+ frame Kainz did more tests with a variety of editing tricks, which you can read about in the full post. Below are some of the photos taken with the Pixel, but that phone only supports maximum 2-second exposures. Kainz speculates that a longer exposures could allow even better low-light photos on smartphones, assuming the subject is not moving and you have a tripod. Amusingly, the Pixel photos were taken in June and July last year, long before the phone was announced. 64 2-second exposures, shot with Google Pixel Many of the editing tweaks used to produce these images could be automated, too. You could imagine an app for Android or a mode in the camera that does most of this for you. Of course, the processing time for a few dozen RAW files would be rather lengthy on a phone. Maybe it could be built into Google Photos? If you want to see more photos from Kainz's experiments, there's a Google Photos album. 64 2-second exposures, shot with Pixel Source: Google Research Tags camera Google google research hdr nexus 6p photography pixel research subscribe ...

Random! Also, fucking skills of whoever is doing all the post processing in these pics. This ain't special about the Pixel and 6P after all, this post processing algorithm could be applied to any phone's pics. madcanada Any pics. Including a DSLR and night sky shots. Gonna try this weekend. shutUface 6p hdr post processing is really good. Throw the photos in snapseed for a little effect. Ocepi https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/63d92d20e4febf4677fb9a1dbbdd2230d3563bf5f95c0c065225af6ddf0baf25.jpg Milton P. This, I need this in my life!!! I'm dying for long exposure option in my phone. ChronoReverse The Htc 10 hardware can do stuff like this already. Here's a 900 second exposure: https://www.flickr.com/photos/maik_reifschneider/29419144492/ HebeGuess same sensors IMX377 as 5X/6P, different optics (with OIS). Pink tint at lower right corner was IR bleed from Laser Autofocus. James Doyle 64 pictures was all they could take before the 6P immediately shut down, probably while the battery read 35%. Snark aside, at this point I think maybe it's too soon to automate something like this on the phone itself, but this would be an amazing thing that Google Photos's AI could automate for us. David Ruddock Exactly. If you could use a stabilizer/tripod and upload the photos to the cloud. That would be nuts. James Doyle I'm almost there for just HDR+. A half dozen HDR+ images all trying to process brings my phone to a crawl, meaning I can't take any more pictures. Let's calm down the processing until I've stopped taking pics, or offload the work to the cloud. jonzey231 Yep. Totally agree with this statement. Once you've got a pretty dark photo trying to process or two decent images trying to process at once, the phone is basically a brick for the next 30 seconds. TSS TS 'The Cloud' doesn't work that way - Cloud based technologies fall under xaaS (IaaS/SaaS/DaaS) - The most common application is DaaS - Which is the only cloud space Google offers to residential consumers. Even if Google created an IaaS product scope, the limitations of current cell protocols would never allow 'processing' to be handed off to anything. Process threads are computed locally. There is nobody on this planet that has figured out how to parse thread computation over ANY WAN/LAN/Network to a central CPU farm to work out xyz process. The concept would be incredibly inefficient anyways. As the CPU processing the threads would have to process the inbound transaction, process the job, then redistribute back to the client. It would being doing 3-10x the work to say nothing have the transaction congestion, and security issues. Reference : Me, i'm a Sys Engineer/Admin. Toodles. Stuart Anderson His point is they could delay and/or limit the HDR+ work until after he's done taking pictures. And post processing like this doesn't need to be real time anyway. Jake Ashton lol. TSS TS got owned! leave it to the "experts" to think inside the box and just tell people what they can't do. toodles Jason Edwards lol EH101 I think you're misunderstanding. What he means is take the 64 pictures (or 3 for regular HDR), let them all get uploaded as you normally would when you hit wifi, then let Google Photos online do the work to make the final picture. Not let the 'cloud' process something that stays on the device in real time. Google already does this to an extent, letting Google Photos 'read' the images and group them by face etc. Sean Buckman I'm using google pixel and I just keep shooting with no lag. It takes a bit(around 5-10 seconds) after taking the pictures to process the HDR+ but it doesn't slow the phone down. Matt I wonder how long it would take to upload 64 RAW files to the cloud... whispy_snippet With Australia's internet speeds I estimate 231 years and six days. Winston What are you talking about?

I wouldn't mind the wait if the phone could just do it fo me though. 7-down And yet, Google Camera app will be dry as bones with basic features. JohnyNoLegs It's like Google don't care about features. Like they think people will be happy with the most basic of applications. 2kool4skool ✓ⱽᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵇʸ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Google dumbed-down their apps to be as simple and as barebone as possible because apparently there are people that are scared with having options. These are the same people that call any phone or app that offers more than basic features as "gimmicks". JohnyNoLegs Completely agree. For some reason, there has always been a market for this. Feels to me it's for people who either don't do that much on their phone, or like buying third party apps for some reason. Tom Harman While I like my pixel, I'll stick to my D800e for 99% of my photos. madcanada Lol, I have a Canon 6D and I stick to Nexus 6P for 99% of my photos :D Patrick Comparing a 6D and a D800e is like comparing a Polaroid to a Leica. They're different tools for much different uses. That being said, I'm surprised that the Pixel wouldn't take over for the d800e... The simplicity, man! I don't shoot my d800 for anything but photo shoots now because the Pixel is too easy to get great shots and I don't have to spend hours in post. catalysto In the context of comparing to a smartphone, they are practically the same. Trent It's impressive, of course. But to suggest that even the best software will help a Pixel rival a DSLR is comedic. Good enough for most, they are, but put them up on a big screen next to similar shots from even a Nikon D3300 and the lack of pixels (amongst other things) will show which is better. There's also the small matter of all that editing hassle. Naturally, I shoot RAW with my DSLR, but a little time in Lightroom is generally all that's needed to make a shot pop. I appreciate that I'm being a little over-the-top in my condemnation, image quality/rivaling "real" cameras is about more than just how good something looks on a smartphone display. It's about being able to zoom in without a major loss of quality and casting the image to a TV and it not looking bad at that size. I do like my Pixel very much and it's great for casual shots. A DSLR replacement it is not, however. David Ruddock I think this is mostly about the power of light-gathering and composite HDR even when in use even with a tiny sensor. It bodes well for the future of algorithmic photography if nothing else - as sensors get better and algorithms do, too, we can keep pushing the limits of these already impressive methods. This example just takes it to an extreme as a showcase. madcanada This article is about the algorithm. You can apply the same process to a DSLR image making night sky shots even better. OhYeah! This is basicly only due to the Photo stacking technique. You can tell from the single image that each photo is pretty terrible but once you median stack the photos it can average out all the noise. You could create a photo that looked pretty great from a Galaxy S 3 if you really wanted to. madcanada Yes, that's what I said. OhYeah! Yep you kind of did in a different way. Good job, you can recognize similarities! TechGuy22 yet no one can buy the pixel thank god i was able to sell my 6p for 500 bucks and bought the xl rjyanj "no one can buy the pixel" "i bought the xl" hmm. TechGuy22 https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel_phone?hl=en-US can you buy it there ? that's what i meant dumb ass. i have an XL too. didn't buy it from google. nxtiak XL: Black 32gb and 128gb ships May 4th. Silver 32gb, available now, 128gb 3-4weeks. So Yes? Non XL are all out of stock. Shawn Spring I did the same, dumped the 6P after I had preordered the Pixel XL on launch day. Boy am I glad I did. Stevie_Wonder Shooting RAW (DNG) and manual exposure. Google just told us what we are missing from the Google Camera app. Thank you Google, but we knew that already. Bala dunno whats stopping google from adding shutter speed and raw format to the google camera. hate them for it JD Saving it for the Pixel 2 *Obviously* Mihai Ionescu What Manual camera app do you reccomend? WittyPixel a post that I made a while back in the 6p XDA forums, enjoy! https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-6p/themes-apps/nexus-6p-manual-camera-recommendations-t3340090 Lizzie McVeigh Adobe's Light Room Camera. You get full control of settings... up to 0.7" of exposure. Random! We desperately need that app you've mentioned, with manual controls for exposure time, aperture and ISO. Scott Olsen There's plenty of them already. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.flavionet.android.camera.pro Mike Or just get any phone that isn't developed by Google. My name is…. the smart choice martesque Like say, the LG V20 camera app. Defenestratus Took this picture on my old Nexus 6P of my neighbor's house the other day while walking the pooch. Moon was right behind the light house. the picture is pretty grainy but still pretty impressive given how dark it was outside (even though it doesn't look like it in the picture, I think Google Photos messed with the settings a bit) https://goo.gl/photos/1VBuUKxRGC7Dutyh7 Rod URL not found Ahamid17 Its a shame I had to give up my 5X for an iPhone because of that boot loop issue other than that I really loved my 5X camera Ahamid17 I would love to see the process in which he combined that 64 and 32 frames to get that result and imagine in the future if your camera app could do that in app instead of doing it on photoshop Tauran This needs to be an automated processing trick on Google photos. HDR is great but people like me don't have time to process photos manually to look this great. WittyPixel Salty post... "This is a composite of 32 frames at 4-second exposure and ISO 1600, taken with the Nexus 6P" realizing google didn't unlock all the capabilities he builds an apps to do so. If google allowed apps to use the sensor to it's full capability then we could do the same and the camera would be truly amazing. Gjorgi Lazarovski I don't get what you're saying but the Camera2 API that's in Android since Lollipop allows this and is fully enabled on both phones. You just need the right app, like Manual Camera from the Play store for example. With a tripod and set of skills in Photoshop you're most likely to get the same results by yourself. Kyle Gospodnetich The Pixel and 6P camera drivers are limited to 2 second exposures max. There are many other phones from other manufacturers that can have much, much longer exposure times set via the Camera2 API. funky There is also a hack on xda to support longer exposures, I guess 4 sec WittyPixel future reference... link or it doesn't exist. and there is not one for the nexus 6p, fyi. funky https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=71165047&postcount=88 WittyPixel wow, being a 6P owner and semi xda nut surprised I missed that. thanks! WittyPixel camera 2 API does not allow that feature. bobinchicago Hey, my Nexus 6P would take great shots too if the battery life wasn't down to an hour and plunging down to 0 the moment I open the camera app. VAVAMk_2 Get a replacement battery dblock I honestly think even the 6P has a better camera than the S8+. I have only had the phone less than a week, but thus far it seems like the camera just isn't as good, back or front camera for that matter. And it may not be the sensors themselves, but perhaps the software. The Google Camera on the Nexus/Pixel devices is just too damn good. JohnyNoLegs Blind tests put the S8 on almost equal footing of the Pixel. It's all in the software. Hence why it takes so long to process images after you take them. Klugschwaetzer Mhh. I'm wondering why I see no star trails after 2 minutes. Stars should not be round, but elongated. Since they are quite round, it seems that this Mr. Kainz has adjusted for earth's motion somehow. But then the branches of the trees should be blurry. Very strange indeed. ChicagoPete I hope you've taken the last 12 minutes to read the source post for this article. Klugschwaetzer I have. Have you? 64 images with two second exposure each means that not counting an intervall between shots you look at the sky for over 128 seconds. The stars will have moved by that time making a virtual overexposure very difficult. Unless he somehow compensated for that. But I don't see how he could have done that - as I said before. Klugschwaetzer Just read the source article. Thanks for pointing that out. jwildman16 Two seconds, not minutes. NinoBr0wn I've given up hope for Google to update their camera app to something above a passing grade. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good strategy by Google to do night pictures. That minimizes the chance of getting halos in the Pixel pictures. whispy_snippet Haven't you already been completely burnt in a camera debate that forced you to leave the discussion without a reply? Why would you want to do it again? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Blocking the Google fanboy. dabug91 because he totally REKT you? LOL Do the world a favor, and refrain from every using the internet again? Billy Bob Jimmy Joe It's funny when the troll blocks you. whispy_snippet Yep, can't win so you quit. Covering yourself in glory once again. Billy Bob Jimmy Joe You are an annoying troll. You probably just don't know it yet. You go to every Google article to bash the Pixel. I also see you bashing the Pixel in an article about a Samsung issue. You, sir, are pathetic. Mix I was like how in the heck can I do this with my Pixel!? ".....he built a simple camera app with manual control over exposure time" Dammit. New_Guy ....aaaa https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/24e29b3703f641799852ae78976add647c419d1f551c6dbd44d370d7d1efcc18.png nd it's now my wallpaper =) inthemidleofnowere What they need is to integrate exposure times, iso, and other of those 2 year old photography tools that have been present in Samsung and LG. Casper Pascal What?!?! How did he make the Nexus 6P do a 4-second long exposure shot? Nexus firmware just allows me to reach 1/5-second exposure time :( yubnub Umm no offense, but these look like crappy DSLR shots. Naxx ENVY I've taken some offence actually. Jason Edwards This is fantastic. I keep trying to tell all of the "photographers" that tell me physics gets in the way of a phone taking a good picture that they are discounting how much software will play in the future of photography. This proves I am right. dabug91 Umm, no, it doesn't prove you're right. Even 10 years from now, cameras with larger sensors will still be producing better images with richer detail than those with tiny sensors. Larger photosites DO make a difference that software simply can't account for. How do we know this? Because a 9-year-old 12-megapixel D700 full-frame DSLR and 28mm f/1.8 or f/2.8 lens still creates better images using software from nearly 9 years ago than what a modern-day flagship smartphone camera does with today's software. Cute ego about being "proven right", tho. Shai Nice long exposure shot of Tel Aviv's beaches I took with the LG G6: https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ed85a80053a2a1b8cbdb82d08e8410f7a33360c8fe6286d26df784785b86cfc7.jpg Biga173rd Exactly dabug91 Exactly really blurry. Biga173rd lol Biga173rd If I were in these locations my shots would look like those too. RainMotorsports It's kind of bad my Nexus 6P is better than my old dSLR in most situations that don't require off camera lighting or telephoto lenses. I need a new camera lol.

Donklephant Primary Navigation Please select a menu in this location Home Software Can You Download Google Play Store on Your PC and Mac? By Donklephant. Published on April 26, 2017. 0 Google Play Store is an app that has been downloaded millions of times by Android users and is an online store for the latest apps in the market, including games, article content, books, televisions, and music. While we have often associated this app with Android devices, it can also be enjoyed on PCs and Macs. With the more than 2 million apps available for download for free or for a price, getting these apps and using them on a desktop or Mac makes the experience more exciting. Moreover, these devices have larger displays than mobile phones. With the use of an APK downloader, it is possible to download Google Play apps to a PC. There is the web client Racoon that can be used for Windows PC. Since PCs only recognize .exe files, an Android emulator software is necessary to do so. It is a known fact that it is not possible to directly install an Android Apk file on a PC but with the emulator, one can enjoy Google Play Store as well. In order to do this, you will need to download Bluestacks Android Emulator on your desktop which you can get from the website. When it comes to running Android apps on your Mac, this can be down by installing a full version of the Android OS via the free VirtualBox software and the Android OS designed for computers with Intel processors. You can install VirtualBox and launch it. Next, click on “New” and type in the name for the Android OS. Simply choose “Linux” for “Type” and “Other Linux” (64-bit) for “Version” and tap on “Continue”. As for MemorySize, Hard Disk and Hard Disk File Type Settings, simply click on “Continue”. For Storage on Physical Hard Disk, choose Fixed Size and click on “Continue”. To finally finish the setup, you will be brought to the File Location and Size screen. Just click the folder icon you want to save the virtual hard disk to and retain the option in default. Next, click “Create”. After this, install Android on it and from the main window, choose Android VM and tick “Start”. Select the Android ISO file you have downloaded earlier and then click “Start”.  You can now follow the next instructions on the screen. After all is done, you can now enter the details of your Google account so you can access Google Play Store. Meanwhile, the upcoming MacBook Pro 2017 promises to be better than its predecessor and if you plan to get it once it is out, you can probably try accessing Google Play Store with it.

Toggle navigation Login Register RS Gathering Diaries × Toggle navigation The Dark Side of Google’s Planned Chrome Ad Blocker Share on Facebook Share on Twitter The Dark Side of Google’s Planned Chrome Ad Blocker Posted at 4:45 pm on April 26, 2017 by Neil Stevens Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Google, which makes a lot of money through the AdWords and Doubleclick For Publishers programs, has predictably been late to the ad blocker train. What they’re finally going to do about it for Chrome might sound good for users, but it might also be a huge act of self-dealing by the browser publisher. Instead of simply blocking all ads within the browser, as most ad blockers do, Google is expected to take a more nuanced approach. That’s a kinder way of saying they’re going to use their access as browser developers to pick winners and losers in the ad industry. Trending VIDEO: Not Only Is Bill Nye a Fraud, He's an Extremist and an Enemy of Freedom Jim Jamitis They’re already known for paying to have their own ads excluded from certain ad blockers: Google already pays to be part of an “Acceptable Ads” program offered by software company Eyeo GmbH, for example, which develops popular ad-blocking tool Adblock Plus. As a result, advertising on Google’s search engine and some of the other ads it powers are allowed to pass through Adblock Plus’s filters. It seems likely that Google would allow its own ads to pass through in a similar manner. Worse, they may penalize entire sites for individual ads, effectively embargoing certain ad providers: In one possible application Google is considering, it may choose to block all advertising that appears on sites with offending ads, instead of the individual offending ads themselves. In other words, site owners may be required to ensure all of their ads meet the standards, or could see all advertising across their sites blocked in Chrome. Chrome is a leading browser. Any action Google takes to prefer itself over other ad providers, is a major act of self-dealing in a high-stakes industry.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: Google These gorgeous night-time photos were all shot with a Google Pixel Chris Smith @chris_writes April 26th, 2017 at 3:53 PM Share Tweet Google’s Pixel phones happen to have some of the best phone cameras out there, right alongside the latest iPhone and Galaxy S phones, but nothing can replace a proper camera — at least, not for the time being. But the following images taken with Google’s Pixel and Nexus 6P smartphones prove the future of low light photography on smartphones is very bright, especially when you remember Google might be working on a few new camera features for upcoming Pixel generations. Don't Miss: NASA’s Cassini spacecraft has one final mission, which ends with destruction After taking a nighttime picture with a professional DSLR camera and sharing the results with his coworkers from Google’s Gcam team, Florian Kainz was challenged to come up with the same remarkable result using smartphones. Image Source: Google Kainz, a software engineer at Google Daydream, accepted that challenge and came up with some amazing shots that seem to indicate phones have hidden camera abilities that allow them to take low light pictures that are just as good as DSLR ones. Image Source: Google In a blog post detailing his work, Kainz explained that the entire process requires some work. For starters, he had to develop an Android app to be able to adjust various settings manually, including exposure time, ISO, and focus distance. He then placed the phones on a tripod to avoid camera shake. After he had taken the images, he used Photoshop on a computer to process them. Image Source: Google The end results are remarkable and seem to indicate that smartphones of the future might offer similar nighttime photography performance.

REUTERS/Robert Galbraith By Anna Irrera and Sruthi Shankar PayPal Holdings Inc (PYPL.O) raised its earnings outlook on Wednesday after reporting higher-than-expected quarterly profit resulting from an increase in payment processing volumes and user growth. The company raised its full-year profit forecast to $1.28-$1.33 per share from $1.26-$1.31, and said its board authorized a $5 billion share buyback programme. Revenue rose 17 percent to $2.98 billion, beating analysts' average estimate of $2.94 billion. Chief Financial Officer John Rainey said the company was planning some staff cuts and other restructuring initiatives which will slash $75 million in annual costs. "Less than 3 percent of our global workforce will be affected and based on current plans, we do not expect a net decrease in headcount for the year," Rainey said. PayPal's shares jumped 6 percent to $47.08 in after-hours trading. Chief Executive Dan Schulman said the company had added 6 million new active accounts in the first quarter, the largest quarterly user increase in the past 3 years. "We're changing the way we're operating as a company," Schulman said. "We're beginning to see the results of what we're capable of here." The San Jose, California-based company has been expanding partnerships and acquiring new services to gain advantage over rivals in a highly competitive digital payments market. Last week it struck a deal with Alphabet Inc's Google (GOOGL.O) in a move to bring its payment wallet to brick-and-mortar stores. Consumers will be able to use their PayPal accounts with Google's mobile payments platform Android Pay at retailers such as WalGreens Boots (WBA.O) and Dunkin' Donuts (DNKN.O). PayPal, which spun off from e-commerce firm eBay Inc (EBAY.O) in 2015, also agreed to buy Canadian bill payment processor TIO Networks Corp (TNC.V) for about $233 million in February. Rainey said growth in revenue had been driven by an increase in payments processing volumes in both its core business and other services such payments platform provider BrainTree. PayPal's total payments volume jumped 22.5 percent to $99.33 billion, beating research firm FactSet StreetAccount's estimate of $99.20 billion. Mobile payments volume rose 51 percent to about $32 billion in the quarter. Payment volumes at Venmo, its mobile peer-to-peer payment platform popular with younger customers, more than doubled to $6.8 billion in the first quarter. "Growth in our Venmo and our core P2P platforms ... supports higher levels of engagement and reduced levels of churn across our consumer base," Rainey said. The company's net income rose to $384 million, or 32 cents per share, in the first quarter, from $365 million, or 30 cents per share, a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, PayPal earned 44 cents per share, above the average analyst estimate of 41 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Lawrence , Detroit Free Press Published 4:13 p.m. ET April 26, 2017 | Updated 8 hours ago The automaker's futuristic Portal Concept vehicle, unveiled in January, would be an ambitious effort to capture a slice of a growing the emerging autonomous vehicle market Exterior designer Matt Dunford speaks beside the unveiled Fiat Chrysler Portal Concept car during the FCA press conference at the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January 2017. (Photo: FREDERIC J. BROWN, AFP/Getty Images) 4 CONNECTTWEET 1 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE While Fiat Chrysler is charging ahead with a deeper partnership with Google's Waymo, that's not the company's only self-driving strategy. Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne told Wall Street analysts in a conference call Wednesday that the automaker has the capability to produce the Chrysler Portal — a semi-autonomous electric minivan it revealed in January — within the next two years. The automaker's futuristic Portal, which was unveiled as a concept vehicle at this year's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, would be an ambitious effort to capture a slice of the emerging autonomous vehicle. Related: Chrysler's self-driving, electronic concept at CES targets millennials Google's Waymo to test autonomous Chrysler's Pacifica minivans in public test trials Marchionne agreed that the vehicle could be released in the next year or two and touted the automaker's other major autonomous driving effort, its partnership with Waymo, formerly known as Google's self-driving car project. Both efforts are big steps for a company often tagged as a laggard in the connected and autonomous vehicle race. Marchionne said he was very encouraged by Waymo's program to put consumers in the Phoenix area in self-driving Chrysler Pacifica Hybrids to try out the vehicles under everyday driving conditions. The automaker said Tuesday it would produce 500 additional Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivans for Waymo. Waymo said those minivans will be used for the early-rider program. Marchionne was willing to enter into a partnership with Waymo even though a number of other automakers passed on the chance to form a partnership with the company. "Because what I think Waymo is capable of doing is leaning on all the work that Goole has done on autonomous vehicles," Marchionne said. "I think they are going to be substantially ahead of everyone else out there. Marchionne also touted the potential of Google Waymo partnership. "This is the kind of exploration that needs to go on. There’s going to be no ready-made solution in the next three years that will effectively exhaust all possible optionalities in this, so we need to play," he said. "And the more we can play, the better we’re going to feel at the end of the day." He also said the industry would be better off sticking to viable autonomous vehicles rather than flying taxis, a reference to reports that flying taxis could be a reality in the next few years. But Marchionne noted that the automaker can't totally depend on its partnership with Waymo as the industry works developing autonomous vehicles, saying the Portal offers another option. "I think banking all of our solutions on one possible outcome is going to be disastrous," he said. The company says the Portal was created by millennials for millennials, touting it as a vehicle that can be upgraded as their lives change and that millennials "expect seamless integration of technology in and out of the vehicle, including to home and other devices." "Millennials have become the largest demographic. In the next 10-plus years, most will be at a point in their life where they will begin to start or will have started a family; 75% of all children will have a millennial parent, and there will be four million more children than today," the release said. The Portal would offer a "third space," which would be a "open and serene atmosphere to bridge work and home." It would get more than 250 miles on a full charge, offer semi self-driving features that would be upgradable as technology progresses, and include seats mounted to tracks so they could move the full length of the vehicle and even be removed.

Rather than creating something that we can use for as long as possible, companies make decisions that shorten an item’s life Planned Obsolescence: Why We Can't Have Nice Things Planned Obsolescence: Why We Can't Have Nice Things How much money are you wasting due to "planned obsolescence"? In this article, we explain what that is, why it should concern you, and what you might be able to do about it. Read More . This is often a strategic decision that turns a one-time customer into a repeat buyer. Some of us are deeply bothered by this. We miss having the option to use the same TV for ten or twenty years. Then there are those of us who don’t particularly mind, for tech advances so rapidly now that we only want to keep a purchase around for a couple of years anyway. And it’s not like the necessary research is cheap. Realistically, most of us fall somewhere in the middle. There are some products we tend to replace often, but there are others we would like to see last as long as possible. Just because you replace your laptop every year, that doesn’t mean you want to regularly replace your fridge as well. However you feel about planned obsolescence, here are some strategies to extend the life of the things you own. 1. Repair What You Can When a product isn’t working correctly, two options often come to mind: return or replace. After a certain amount of time, the option to return goes away. But you may not have to run to the store for a replacement. Sometimes you do have the option to repair what you’ve bought. Many of today’s gadgets are designed to keep us out What Is the Right to Repair and Why Should You Care? What Is the Right to Repair and Why Should You Care? When old technology broke, you could fix yourself. If that failed, you could find a repair shop. With newer products, those options are disappearing.

Some require parts that only the manufacturer knows where to find. But some gadgets aren’t that hard to get working again. If you aren’t yet familiar with iFixit.com, check it out. The site is a true resource. After you grow accustomed to fixing your own things, you may feel inclined to join the growing number of advocates trying to enshrine our right to repair into law. You may want to do so even if you don’t get your hands dirty yourself.

Avoid the Latest Trends Developers don’t expect a fitness band to stand the test of time. A smart thermostat may have some failsafes to keep the device working without an internet connection, but much of the functionality is gone. For cutting edge electronics, longevity often isn’t even an afterthought. No one really knows what smart homes will look like five years from now. Many companies involved with creating that future are moving forward with the dream of locking us into their ecosystem Ecobee3 vs. Nest Thermostat: A Head-to-Head Comparison Ecobee3 vs. Nest Thermostat: A Head-to-Head Comparison Did you know that a smart thermostat can boost your home value?

Make Your Own Gadgets Many of the new products coming to market don’t offer new functionality — they offer a nice package. They’re presenting a way to do something that consumers can get up and running for minimal effort. If you’re willing to get your hands dirty, so to speak, you can obtain similar results without giving up your data or being left with a product that doesn’t work after a year.

Read More , you can create your own automated solutions. If you have kids, passing these skills onto them can set them on a more creative and inventive path through life. As for us adults, it’s not too late to make this change ourselves. 4. Reuse What You Have While you’re making your own gadgets, take a look at the ones rotting away in your junk drawer. Many of those items are no longer good at serving their original purpose, but they can have a second life as something else. A smartphone doesn’t need cellular service or updates to serve a sound recorder, remote control, or any number of creative uses 10 Creative Ways to Use Your Old Smartphone 10 Creative Ways to Use Your Old Smartphone Why sell or throw away your old smartphone when there are so many ways for you to reuse it? Some of those reuses might be more creative than you thought. Here are some ideas. Read More .

Admittedly, that takes a lot more effort than any of the other options I just listed, but that’s not a barrier if you’re interested enough. 5. Ditch Proprietary Standards Phone chargers often outlive the phones they come with. That’s because most of them adopted the MicroUSB standard Understanding USB Cable Types & Which One to Use Understanding USB Cable Types & Which One to Use The world of USB cables can be a bit confusing because there are so many different connector types. Here's everything you need to know to not be confused any longer. Read More years ago, and they’re still useful today. An old phone charger can charge everything from your current phone to your Bluetooth speaker or wireless gamepad. This saves money and reduces waste. Have you ever wondered why each laptop uses a different power adapter? There’s no functional reason for this. Companies simply see this as an opportunity to make more money. It may not matter if your last three laptops all came from the same manufacturer. If you want a second charger lying around, you have to buy a new one. The industry hasn’t abandoned this tactic, but there is hope. A number of laptops now draw power via USB-C What Is USB Type-C? What Is USB Type-C? Ah, the USB plug. It is as ubiquitous now as it is notorious for never being able to be plugged in right the first time. Read More . Despite using the same plug, these cables aren’t already interchangeable. Nonetheless, USB-C powder adapters still have a better chance of working with your next laptop than some proprietary cable. Don’t limit yourself to charging ports and cables. When given a choice, pursue the open standard. Look for memory storage, file formats, and accessories that don’t limit you to one device or brand. 6. Use Free and Open Source Software Commercial apps typically have an expiration date. Once a developer stops actively supporting a piece of software, the clock starts ticking. It may work on the current version of your operating system, but bugs may appear once you move to the next release — if the program runs at all. Since the code is locked away, no one except the developer can tweak the software to run on newer machines. This problem is especially rampant on mobile devices, where apps can come and go overnight. Free and open source software plays by a different rulebook. The source code that makes these programs run is available for anyone to look at. Even once a developer abandons a project, someone else can pick up the baton. Applications often spread to as many operating systems as possible, so you’re free to use whichever you want. FOSS apps free you from vendor lock-in What Is Software Vendor Lock-In? (And How to Avoid It) What Is Software Vendor Lock-In? (And How to Avoid It) Software vendor lock-in is considered by some to be a big infringement on your rights as a consumer. But what is it? Why is it so bad? And how can you avoid it? Read More . Your data and freedom to choose remain yours. 7. Shop Second-Hand Thrift stores offer some of the cheapest prices on PCs you can find.

Hate the idea of contributing a new smartphone to the landfill every few years? Hate the idea of putting apps on your wrist or wearing a tracker that won’t let you switch phones? Then don’t. It really is that simple. Sure, depending on where you live, you can’t go without owning a car. But few gadgets, or even most appliances, are absolute essentials. You can live a satisfying life reading books, playing board games with friends The Best Family Board Games You've Never Heard Of The Best Family Board Games You've Never Heard Of Have your board game nights fallen into a boring rut?

You can find the nearest park or movie theater without looking up the information from your car. Is your life really made better by being able to play videos merely by speaking the words out loud. Doesn’t a remote control already make it easy enough to waste all day in front of a screen? Commercials would have us think that we can’t live without buying one more thing. Silicon Valley is packed with companies claiming to benefit society and improve the quality of human life. Is any of this true? The negative impacts of over-convenience and over-stimulation are not hard to find 5 Ways Technology Might Be Feeding Your Depression 5 Ways Technology Might Be Feeding Your Depression Technology can worsen depression. With tech enveloping our lives, we should be more aware of technology's potential impact on us. There are some things you can do to lessen the burden. Read More . You won’t just make a run around planned obsolescence by opting out, you may be making the kind of change that leads to a richer life. Planned Obsolescence Isn’t Inherently Bad But we do need to re-evaluate our expectations. An old MP3 player from 2006 can still play music. An old cell phone can still place calls. An old newspaper or magazine still tells the news, even if it’s no longer current. But a seven-year old smartphone can’t complete most of its original functions. Is this truly a step forward for technology? We buy houses expecting them to last for decades. You can learn how to fix and extend the life of different parts of your home simply by watching YouTube 17 Easy Home Repair Tips You Can Learn From YouTube Anytime 17 Easy Home Repair Tips You Can Learn From YouTube Anytime You can take care of minor home repairs yourself, instead of paying the handyman. These YouTube videos have all the DIY tips, instructions, and list of tools you need to get everything fixed. Read More . In the tech world, this is akin to buying or building a desktop PC. Due to the rate of technological change, your rig won’t last decades, but it can stay relevant longer than a laptop or tablet incapable of upgrades. Should we accept gadgets that offer the allure of new features but sacrifice the longevity and durability of the generation that came before them? Even if you’re fine with replacing gadgets every other year, or you lease rather than own as a way to keep up with the latest models, consider the environmental price that the entire ecosystem pays to support our drive to turn nonrewable resources into throwaway products. Then there are the ethical questions raised by sweatshops built to satisfy our demand for low prices. The solution may be one where we lease tech products from manufacturers through a monthly or yearly subscription. When new models are released, we trade in our existing devices back to the manufacturer, who then recycles the materials to make more devices. This way companies still bring in the high profits that incentivize them to push forward with bold, creative new tech. Plus the arrangement is more transparent about our lack of true ownership over many modern service-based products. What do you do to resist planned obsolescence? What changes would you make to the way we invest in technological advancements? This is a complex topic, so I look forward to your insightful comments!

Google Home has five million options Google Assistant can give you step-by-step instructions through the Google Home smart speaker for more than five million recipes. Tyler Lizenby/CNET Smart Home by Ashlee Clark Thompson 26 April 2017 5:24 pm BST @AshleeEats Enlarge Image The Google Home will be able to give you step-by-step recipe instructions thanks to an update that will roll out in the coming week. Tyler Lizenby/CNET Google Home, the always-listening smart speaker, will soon be able to give you step-by-step verbal instructions for more than five million recipes, the internet giant said Wednesday on its blog. The new feature is possible because of an update to Google Assistant, the virtual helper that's integrated into Google Home and Google's Pixel phones. Google will roll out the update in the coming week. Google's addition of guided cooking is a big leap for smart speakers finding a home in the kitchen. Amazon Alexa, the virtual assistant that powers smart speakers like the Amazon Echo, has skills that can read out recipes to you, but the instructions come all at once, so you can't go back if you missed a step. Google, however, said the Google Assistant's update will give you one instruction at a time and let you ask to repeat a step. This makes cooking with a smart speaker more conversational and interactive. Amazon's not too far behind creating a friendlier sous chef, though -- Anova Culinary, the makers of the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi-connected Anova Precision Cooker immersion circulator, will soon debut an Alexa skill that will walk you through sous vide recipes. Here's how the Google Assistant's cooking update will work: Find a recipe through Google Assistant on your Android phone or through the Google Search app on iOS or Android. Select the "Send to Google Home" button for your recipe. Say "Ok Google, start cooking" or "Ok Google, start recipe" to your Google Home. Follow the instructions Google Home gives you. The recipes come from publications such as Bon Appetit, The New York Times and Food Network. The step-by-step instructions on Google Home won't work with recipes from websites or blogs that you find outside of Google Assistant or Google Search.

Here's what investors need to know ahead of the internet search giant's first-quarter report. Steve Symington (TMFSymington) Apr 26, 2017 at 3:46PM Shares of Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) are up 23% over the past year, including a nearly 13% climb in 2017 (as of this writing) to sit near all-time highs. The internet-search behemoth can thank its exceptional fourth-quarter 2016 results, announced in late January, for that climb, driven by the success of its mobile search and YouTube platforms, as well as momentum in its early-stage "other bets" businesses. But at least in the near term, this week's report will show whether Alphabet was able to sustain its momentum as it kicked off the new year. So let's take a closer look at what investors should be watching when Alphabet reports tomorrow, after the market closes. IMAGE SOURCE: ALPHABET. Alphabet's headline numbers First, keep in mind that Alphabet doesn't provide specific quarterly revenue or earnings guidance. So for perspective -- while we don't typically pay close attention to Wall Street's demands -- consensus estimates predict first-quarter revenue will climb 19.4% year over year, to roughly $24.19 billion, and translate to earnings of $7.40 per share. More broadly speaking, management did tell investors last quarter that Alphabet plans to focus its efforts this year both on continuing the momentum of Google's core advertising business (which we'll discuss more below), and simultaneously investing in newer diversified revenue streams including Google Play, hardware like Chromecast and the Pixel smartphone, and Google's cloud computing and hosting platforms. "G" is for Google In keeping with Alphabet's reorganization and shift toward segment-based reporting just over a year ago, expect to see a breakdown of the company's two primary operating segments: Google and "Other Bets." The former is the financial core of Alphabet's business, encompassing Search, Android, Maps, Chrome, Google Play, Gmail, and YouTube, as well as Commerce, Apps, Cloud, and hardware. Together, these services represented nearly 99% of Alphabet's total $26 billion in revenue and all operating income last quarter. Within that, advertising revenue comprised almost 86% of total revenue last quarter. But don't be surprised if advertising's influence falls as contributions from non-advertising businesses increase. Alphabet will also break those results down to help investors better understand its ad revenue, including the growth and percentage that came from its own properties versus network member sites. We'll also see the latest growth in aggregate paid clicks (up 36% year over year last quarter), as well as aggregate cost per click, the latter of which measures how much Google makes per ad. Note, however, that aggregate cost per click has steadily declined in recent quarters -- the metric fell 15% in Q4 -- thanks to enviable growth at YouTube, where the TrueView ad format monetizes at lower rates as a byproduct of reaching consumers earlier in the purchase funnel. What to watch in Other Bets Meanwhile, the Other Bets segment is made up of promising pre-revenue businesses operating in a wide variety of industries, including Google Fiber (high-speed internet), Calico (human longevity), Verily (life-sciences products), Google Capital (capital investments), Nest (connected home), and X ("moonshot" initiatives). But while Other Bets' top line is growing nicely through sales of Nest, Fiber, and Verily products, this segment will almost certainly continue to generate large operating losses. Last quarter, for example, Other Bets revenue climbed nearly 75% year over year, to $262 million, and generated an operating loss of $1.088 billion -- albeit narrowed from an operating loss of $1.213 billion in the same year-ago period. Of course, those losses are more than recouped through Alphabet's immensely profitable Google operations. And Alphabet management will likely reiterate that investors would do best to view Other Bets through a long-term lens, noting that their eventual success could hold the key to unlocking several multibillion-dollar industries. In any case, tomorrow's report will give us a peek at Alphabet's progress toward that end. So be sure to check back to see how it fares.

Google is adding step-by-step recipes to Google Home. This feature will include more than five million recipes from sources like Bon Appetite, The New York Times, Food Network, and more. To access the feature, you can launch Google Assistant on your Android phone or Google Search on your Android or iOS device. Once you find a recipe that you want to try, tap the “Send to Google Home” button and your recipe will be saved. When you’re ready to cook, say “Ok Google, start cooking” or “Ok Google, start recipe.” Once you’re cooking, you can use commands like “Ok Google, repeat” and “Ok Google, what’s step two?”. Google says that this feature will roll out over the coming week. It’s a pretty nifty addition to Google Home because sometimes when you’re cooking, you’ve got your hands full or covered in food and you’re unable to turn the page in a recipe book or tap the screen of your phone. Now Google Home owners can get the steps to their recipe hands-free.

With the billions of webpages written in English, it can be difficult for some non-native English speakers to understand the things on a page. However, there’s also the fact that only 15 percent of the world population speak it as their primary or secondary language. There seems to be no balance but good thing the translate feature is available. Web browsers like Chrome even has it built-in for easier translation. Google Translate was improved last year when it adapted neural machine translation technology. This allowed translation of whole sentences instead of just phrase by phrase or word by word. This also delivered more relevant translation so people can easily understand the right context with more accuracy. We know a lot of people are greatly benefiting from this web service but there are still other languages and dialects not given much attention. Quality of translations are low on some but Google today announced that it’s improving neural machine translation for Indonesian and eight more Indian languages: Bengali, Kannada, Gujarati, Telugu, Tamil, Punjabi, Marathi, and Malayalam. In Chrome, over 20 languages are now enabled with neural machine translations including English for Chinese, German, French, Hindi, Hebrew, Korean, Japanese, Thai, Vietnamese, Thai, Turkish, and Spanish to English (one-way). We’re expecting more languages will be added in the coming months. Google focused on India this time because with over 400 million netizens living in India, more people are encountering English content that need to be translated. India has several languages so it’s really necessary that the neural machine translation tech comes in.

Wednesday, April 26, 2017 [Tweets] [Favorites] Google Rewrites Search Rankings to Bury Fake News Mark Bergen: The Alphabet Inc. company is making a rare, sweeping change to the algorithm behind its powerful search engine to demote misleading, false and offensive articles online. Google is also setting new rules encouraging its “raters” -- the 10,000-plus staff that assess search results -- to flag web pages that host hoaxes, conspiracy theories and what the company calls “low-quality” content. […] “It was not a large fraction of queries -- only about a quarter percent of our traffic -- but they were important queries,” said Ben Gomes, vice president of engineering for Google. Danny Sullivan: How’s Google learning from the data to figure out what’s authoritative? How’s that actually being put into practice? Google wouldn’t comment about these specifics. It wouldn’t say what goes into determining how a page is deemed to be authoritative now or how that is changing with the new algorithm. It did say that there isn’t any one particular signal. Instead, authority is determined by a combination of many factors. […] My best guess is that for infrequent and unusual queries, Google has been giving more weight to pages that seem a better contextual match, even if they lack strong authority. Ben Thompson: This simply isn’t good enough: Google is going to be making decisions about who is authoritative and who is not, which is another way of saying that Google is going to be making decisions about what is true and what is not, and that demands more transparency, not less. Again, I tend to agree that fake news is actually more of a problem on Google than it is Facebook; moreover, I totally understand that Google can’t make its algorithms public because they will be gamed by spammers and fake news purveyors. But even then, the fact remains that the single most important resource for finding the truth, one that is dominant in its space thanks to the fact that being bigger inherently means being better, is making decisions about what is true without a shred of transparency.

Google's presence at Moffett Field (pictured above), a former air base and NASA research facility located three miles from the search giant's headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., has long been controversial, and is also apparently secretive, according to a Bloomberg report that suggests Google co-founder Sergey Brin is building an enormous dirigible there. Google's parent company Alphabet took over management of the 1,000-acre site from the government in 2015, but Brin, his fellow co-founder Larry Page, and Alphabet CEO Eric Schmidt have long housed their private jets there, facing criticism in 2013 for accepting steep discounts on jet fuel from the federal government for their private fleet. Related Google Founders Eye 'Fully Reasoning' AI Google Founders Eye 'Fully Reasoning' AI The executives have also contributed to scientific research at Moffett, striking a deal for NASA to use their planes during their downtime in exchange for the privilege of parking them in government hangars. And now that Alphabet manages those hangars, one of them is giving birth to Brin's giant airship project, according to Bloomberg. Citing people familiar the project, Bloomberg reported that the craft's metal skeleton already exists inside Moffett's Hangar 2. Former NASA aerospace engineer Alan Weston is leading the project, which isn't part of Alphabet. The company's Planetary Ventures arm, which manages the hangars, could not immediately be reached for comment on Wednesday, and Brin declined to comment on his airship plans, according to Bloomberg. It's also unclear what else Alphabet is currently working on at Moffett, beyond vague details announced in 2014 when Planetary Ventures took over the hangars, which included investing $200 million to restore them and open an educational facility for the general public to learn about Moffett's history. It is that history that prompted Brin's interest in dirigibles, according to Bloomberg, which reported that Brin decided to build one after he saw old photos of the Macon, a US Navy dirigible built at Moffett in the 1930s.

Posted on April 26, 2017, 19:38 GMT Sheera Frenkel BuzzFeed Staff Share On facebook Share On facebook Share Share On vk Share On vk Share Share On pinterest Share On pinterest Share On pinterest Share On pinterest Pin Share On lineapp Share On lineapp Share Share On twitter Share On twitter Share Share On email Share On email Share On sms Share On sms Share On whatsapp Share On whatsapp Share On more Share On more Share On more Share On more More Share On tumblr Share On tumblr Share On stumbleupon Share On stumbleupon Share On linkedin Share On linkedin Share On reddit Share On reddit Share On googleplus Share On googleplus Share On link Share On link Share On facebook Share On facebook Share Share On pinterest Share On pinterest Share On pinterest Share On pinterest Pin Share On email Share On email Share On link Share On link Share This Link Adalberto Roque / AFP / Getty Images Share On facebook Share On facebook Share Share On pinterest Share On pinterest Share On pinterest Share On pinterest Pin People use public WiFi to connect their devices in a street of Havana. SAN FRANCISCO — Google’s servers in Cuba went live on Wednesday, making the internet giant the first foreign internet company to host content within the long cut-off country. The servers are part of Google’s global network of caching servers, called GGC nodes, the servers work by storing popular content — like a viral YouTube video — on a local server. Instead of having to travel the long distance through a submarine cable, which currently connects Cuba to the internet through Venezuela, Cubans will now be able to access content through the nearest Google server in their country. “I think this will be very noticeable for Cubans,” said Doug Madory, director of internet analysis at Dyn, a global internet monitoring company. “The internet in Cuba will still be a painfully slow process. This is just another somewhat rare step forward. For Google services, which will be hosted in country, it will be a milestone.” Despite hopes that Cuba would begin opening up its internet access following the re-establishment of diplomatic between the US and Cuba in 2015, Cuba still has the lowest level of internet connectivity in the western hemisphere. For most Cubans, the internet can only be accessed through 240 public access wi-fi spots dotted around the country. An hour of internet access costs roughly $1.50, which for Cubans earning the country’s average wage of $25 a month, can be prohibitively expensive. Cuba’s State Telecommunications company, Etecsa, recently begun running a pilot program to install internet connections in 2,000 homes throughout the country, but once the pilot is over the service will cost around $15 for 30 hours of internet at a slow speed of 128 kilobytes per second — a similarly off-putting price for most Cubans. Google acknowledges that the deal won’t do much to increase internet access for the average person in Cuba. In a blog post published last December to mark the signing of the deal between Cuba and the tech giant, Google executives wrote, "Cubans who already have access to the internet and want to use our services can expect to see an improvement in terms of quality of service and reduced latency for cached content." Madory, however, said that it appeared that Google was rolling out the change slowly. When he tested the service Wednesday morning using a server in Cuba he could access remotely, he was still being directed to Google services outside the country. “I can see the server is there and I can interact with it, but Cubans are not yet getting automatically connected to it.” Sheera Frenkel is a cybersecurity correspondent for BuzzFeed News based in San Francisco.

Google Is Killing Gchat For Good and We Have Feelings Go away, Hangouts. Pretty soon, Gchat, or "Google Talk," will be gone forever. RIP Gchat. It's been a hell of a ride, and I'm not ready to see you go. As you might've noticed, Google is unilaterally force-quitting your option to revert to Gchat. Over the last few years, this has been a nice cheat for people, like me, who don't like Google Hangouts or change. But in two months, whether we're ready or not, it'll be byebye to the beloved messaging service. Google Talk alert in Gmail. Google unceremoniously announced that it would be killing Gchat in a blog post last month. "Hangouts offers advanced improvements over Google Talk such as group video calling and integration with other Google products," the company wrote. "With the introduction of Hangouts Meet and Hangouts Chat, which add further improvements in meetings and team collaboration, it is now time to say goodbye to Google Talk." Mmmmmm, what, no. Since its launch in 2013, Hangouts has been one long, bug-ridden journey. Almost immediately after its debut, a faction of OG 'chatters protested the service, and rightly so. Hangouts was slow, heavy, and intrusive. It was, and still is, an aggressively worse form of Google+, the company's failed social platform. In place of simple emoticons came, as John Brownlee put it, "a library of the ugliest ones you've ever seen, designed by Google's resident Fentanyl addict." Even Hangouts' prime offering, the ability to video conference with other Gmail users—which, face it, only your employers make you use—was clunky and tedious, often freezing up in the middle of calls. Google Hangouts emoji. Basically, the whole thing was just too much. None of that matters now, because Google is taking away our favorite means of work-day procrastination. Maybe Google knows that Gchat is a pervasive timesuck. Maybe this is all a psyop to discourage us from goofing off. Google Hangouts video conference fail. I tried to get in touch with Google to share my feelings. In its reply to me, a spokesperson simply copied and pasted a portion of the blog post I'd just linked to. They also referred me to an article by The Verge which insensitively said of the transition: "You've got plenty of other options to use going forward," such as Allo, Duo, Hangouts, Android Messages, Voice, and Supersonic Fun Voice Messenger—all of which are bloated and/or have very few users. Additionally, I also tracked down a general hotline for Google's Mountain View campus and talked to an operator there. Why, I asked, is Google doing this to us? Can you please explain what I'm supposed to do if I love Gchat but hate Hangouts? While she was sure that I "had extensively researched these questions on the internet," the operator generously agreed to look into my queries. After being put on hold for a few minutes, however, she returned with no answers. I asked if others had complained about the switch, and while no one had called her specifically, she wouldn't be surprised if I wasn't alone in my concerns. Next, I tried the Hangouts Help Forum, where people can post questions for the Hangouts team. I was comforted to find that other users were similarly distressed. "Hangouts is simply not a suitable replacement...and you obviously don't care," someone named Velvet Sky wrote. "What SIMPLE chat program can I use now? Hangouts not an option," said jjiimm_64. "I am disappointed in you Google," jjiimm_64 (JIM???) added. The only semi-useful response was a suggestion to try Google Allo, a messaging app which, "if you care at all about your privacy," my colleague Jason Koebler once wrote, you should not use. (Allo, despite offering end-to-end encryption, also allows a chatbot called Google Assistant to peer into your conversations unless disabled through "incognito mode.") After some mildly strenuous research, I never discovered an antidote to my sad feelings. I know it's pointless to get attached to technology, but Gchat was the only messaging service that valued the messaging part over the actual service. Plus, unlike other messaging apps that are fragmented and niche, Gchat came with added benefit of everyone (or at least most people) already being on Gmail. It was minimalist, discreet, and intimate—values that are hard to come by in an age where everything must be scalable, social, and platform-ized. Oh, well. At least I have two months to prepare. :-(

Google’s Brin secretly builds an airship By Ashlee Vance Published 12:28 pm, Wednesday, April 26, 2017 Larry Page has his flying cars. Sergey Brin shall have an airship. Brin, the Google co-founder, has secretly been building a huge airship inside of Hangar 2 at the NASA Ames Research Center, according to four people with knowledge of the project. It’s unclear whether the craft, which looks like a zeppelin, is a hobby or something Brin hopes to turn into a business. “Sorry, I don’t have anything to say about this topic right now,” Brin wrote in an email. The people familiar with the project said Brin has long been fascinated by airships. His interest in the crafts started when Brin would visit Ames, which is located next to Google parent Alphabet’s headquarters in Mountain View. In the 1930s, Ames was home to the Macon, a huge airship built by the U.S. Navy. About three years ago, Brin decided to build one of his own after ogling old photos of the Macon. In 2015, Google unit Planetary Ventures took over the large hangars at Ames from NASA and turned them into laboratories for the company. Brin’s airship, which isn’t an Alphabet project, is already taking shape. Engineers have constructed a metal skeleton of the craft, and it fills up much of the enormous hangar. TOP BUSINESS VIDEOS: Story continues below | Business news first: Sign in for newsletters Latest business videos Alan Weston, the former director of programs at NASA Ames, is leading Brin’s airship project, according to the people, who asked not to be named discussing the secretive plans. Weston didn’t respond to requests for comment. Weston has a background befitting such an unusual enterprise. Born to Australian parents, Weston spent some of his youth in Turkey and then ended up at the University of Oxford. There he became a key member of the Dangerous Sports Club — a group of very intelligent risk-takers that formed in the early 1970s and did things such as catapult people across fields into nets. Members of the club are credited with inventing the modern form of bungee jumping. Weston, for example, performed one of the first bungee jumps by hurling himself off the Golden Gate Bridge and then eluded the authorities waiting to capture him on shore. He also hiked Mount Kilimanjaro and then attempted to hang-glide down, only to crash and hurt his ankle in the process. Years later, Weston joined the Air Force and did engineering work as part of the government’s Strategic Defense Initiative — known more broadly as the Star Wars missile defense system. In 1989, Weston oversaw one of the first tests of Star Wars, which aimed to destroy incoming Russian missiles midair with weapons fired from space. Following his stint at the Air Force, Weston joined NASA and worked on a wide number of projects, including the development of a low-cost lunar lander. In a radio interview in 2013, Weston described plans for an airship that could be used to haul cargo. The idea is that airships could be more fuel-efficient than planes and could carry loads directly to where they’re needed, rather than to transport centers like airports or shipping stations. “New airship technologies have the promise to reduce the cost of moving things per ton-mile by up to an order of magnitude,” Weston said in the interview. “It depends on the size of the airship. A larger airship can reduce costs a lot more than a smaller ship, but there’s design of a class of vehicles that can lift up to 500 tons that could be actually more fuel-efficient than even a truck.” He went on to describe a prototype he was considering of a helium-based craft that appeared to breathe. “And so the way that works is that the helium in the main envelope is taken and stored in bags inside the airship at a slightly higher pressure,” he said. “As you do that, air is taken in from the outside into essentially like lungs that are attached in the side of the vehicle. So the analogy of breathing is a good one. And the overall lift of the vehicle is equal to the weight of the air that is being displaced by the helium. And as you change that, you can control the amount of buoyancy that the vehicle has.” This technique, according to Weston, would allow the airship to carry 500 tons without the need for a ballast. After being contacted about the airship, Weston changed his profile on LinkedIn to list his current job as chief executive officer of ‘‘Ltare.’’ He then removed the post. There have been many attempts to build airships of this type in recent years. It’s fitting for such a project to take place in Silicon Valley, which seems to have entered a steampunk phase, as people race to build things ranging from flying cars to tiny reusable rockets. Brin’s airship is separate from a freight project called Calcifer that was shelved by Google X, the company’s experimental research lab, in 2014. Alphabet CEO Page, Brin’s Google co-founder, has funded at least two secretive flying-car projects — startups Kitty Hawk and Zee.Aero, also separate from Alphabet. Page has begun to take the wraps off one of these efforts — on Monday, Kitty Hawk released a video showing one of its all-electric vehicles taking off and soaring over a lake with the driver perched on top.

Google Assistant's screen search has been moved to a button Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/14 9:02am PDTApr 14, 2017 75 Plus 1 on G+ 16 Share on Facebook 44 Share on Twitter Total Shares135 Applications Google News Google Now on Tap was introduced alongside Android 6.0 Marshmallow, which used context on your screen to help you find information. Google Assistant replaced Now on Tap (for compatible devices), and carried over most of its functionality. Now Assistant is making it slightly more obvious that it can search your screen and take screenshots.    Left: Old design; Center, Right: New design Before, screen search results would appear below the main Assistant prompt after a few seconds, and the screenshot button was found below the screen search results. Buttons for screen search and taking a screenshot are now immediately visible when Assistant is opened. This is a minor improvement, but definitely a welcome one. The change appears to be part of a server-side update, so if you don't have it, you will soon.

The old swipe up barely even worked most of the time. I've been waiting for them to do something like this. Paul Smith Don't even have assistant yet... Nexus 5x 7.12 samiazza Same here, is there any way to get it without root? Suresh Aryal Change the phone language to US English, delete Google app data and you should be running Assistant after few setup screens or just wait for few hours. samiazza Thank you, it worked:-) belac77 that's so weird. I've had Assistant on my Moto G Play running Marshmallow from the second or third day the rollout began! Zahir_SMASH be glad you don't. bekifft Seriously, enjoy it while it lasts. Assistant is a downgrade in every way. Alex Dueppen Is it just me or did Assistant get rid of the OCR thing where you could select text on your screen? Bombaglad this was never a part of assistant, only now on tap Nicholas Matranga Nope, they removed it for some reason. That was one of the main things I used now on tap for. Roh_Mish Used it all the time to select and copy text it to search for something Corbin Davenport That feature was never ported to Assistant. Mohammad Fazal Love this Now on tap feature. And now its gone :/ Evgany Used it all the time. Bring it back. Ruel Johnson It's still there you highlight the text then once you open assistant you tap "What's on my screen" Rami Hmm, never knew that worked. Still doesn't help if the text is in an image or it is non selectable text. Steve Riendeau Awesome, thank you! XgudwilX Not the same. You could copy text from within any app, screen, photo, whatever. Even a photo you took of a food label, street sign, or hand written note. Many languages and fonts too. You'd just hit the little copy (👆🏿)icon and go to town. It was amazing. The Now On Tap reverse image search, from within the camera app was awesome too. Much faster than what the Assistant tries to do. It's usually hit or miss. Oh well, maybe this new change is Google making room to bring back the text select (👆🏿) icon! Evgany But what if it's non selectable or an image? MayorMcCheese Main reason I removed Assistant David Hyman While not ideal and not always a option, you can select text and then trigger the assistant and it'll use that for search context. And there are other apps CTRL-F (I think) that does basically the same thing. So you can share the screenshot with CTRL-F and then copy the text form there kalehv Also I remember Google Now on Tap did screen search when Camera was open. Was helpful to read barcodes but now that's gone. I don't want to install another app just to read barcodes, or QR codes whatever. mjmdroid Got it and already used it more than 4 times today Nicholas Smith Is there any way to use google assistant to schedule calendar events from your text messages? That was a huge feature of on-tap and I don't get why it went away. SocialSupaCrew Yes it's still present with assistant :) Miles Reiter What kind of context were you using that feature in with Assistant? I was trying to get that to work the other day with a clearly spelled out date and time from an email, and it wasn't finding a thing on my screen. motoridersd Awesome! I hated scrolling down to get to the button, so I wasn't using this feature much. This is much better. Eddy Nelson Lopez They need to bring text selection back! Deeco I got a Screenshot of not having Google Assistant, shall I share? FU Google demarcmj no thank you abqnm Maybe someday they'll add a button to open the damn Google app from the assistant pop-up. If I can't talk to my phone, I want to still be able to search without having to go back to the homescreen and then into the Google app. Miles Reiter I'm thinking about writing some kind of case study around the rollout of Assistant and the pro's/con's compared to Now on Tap. What you mentioned is definitely a pain point in my own usage. I'm curious whether there's anything else (good or bad) that stands out to you about Assistant. Luke Taylor As a language learner, one of the big setbacks about GA is that I no longer have the ability to translate my screen or select specific text on my screen if the screen search doesn't pull up any results. I used those on a daily basis! Mathsiel Totally agree... Grey It's easy. You hit the Google icon next to the search, nothing happens, you fumble around, you tap the search box, you swipe up and down, you get very frustrated, and eventually it randomly closes on you when you try pressing the phone back button, so you press the "recent apps" button but it doesn't exist and you get even more frustrated so you tap the Home Screen Search Box and tap the Google icon and Google Now might load. See? Easy. bekifft Exactly. They're trying to force you to use voice. Even with Siri you can just type into it once it's launched. LOL There are still things that Google Now does better then Assistant.....Very annoying Cory S Eh, I think Now did just about everything better than Assistant. aRvInD I want my Google Now onTap back? Is there any mod to get it? Zahir_SMASH Change your phone's language to US Virgin Islands English. You get Now On Tap back, and Google's voice responses get an Australian accent, which I think you can fix, but I find charming in its own way. titetanium Go to apkmirror and download Google App version 6.11.21 or earlier. You'll probably lose any recent data saved in the current version, but Now on Tap will be back. Don't upgrade the app afterwards. Profit. Zahir_SMASH That's a lot more trouble than just changing your language to another English option titetanium Perhaps, but you won't have to worry about getting Assistant going forward as long as you stay on the old version. How long before El Goog updates the other English language options to have Assistant? Miles Reiter What are some of those things that Now did better for you? To be clear I definitely agree, just looking for some things I might not have thought of for writing a case study on the subject! LOL To be honest I don't really use them often. But I really like how Google Now gives you this nice weather card with ton of info, there is no such a thing in Assistant. Also Google Now is able tell which song is playing, again it's missing from Assistant brownjames Text search from any screen. Selection of non selectable onscreen text. Language translation of non selectable text onscreen. Those are my favorite 3 features of Now on Tap that are not in Assistant. Luke Taylor Exactly the same as you. Text translation and selection was used daily by me. Hugely bummed that Assistant can't do it. Michel Sa I could do image searrch (searching by image) using Now on tap, Assistant can't Mohit Saini Will Moto X2 get google assistant? Or it's only available to 64bit devices like s7,nexus 6p...... Zahir_SMASH Pretty sure it is supposed to be rolling out to any device with Marshmallow and up. Corbin Davenport It's for any phone (not tablet) running 6.0 and up, and I think there's a minimum RAM requirement too. Zahir_SMASH Good to know, thanks blindexecutioner Still isn't as good as now on tap. Before when I'd use that on my home screen it would bring up a bunch of options like navigate to work or home. Now it just says there isn't anything. Margaritas Ante Porcos Bixby button is a good place for Google Assistant. diskostu I hate the Assistant, but I love Now On Tap. Is there any way to get Now On Tap back? ro.opa.eligible_device=false does not work anymore. Major Sceptic I liked on tap too , the assistant may be ok in some ways , but I find myself using the AI features less now than when I had on tap . Sometimes I wonder if having all the Wizz bang software that tries to make life easier by bombarding us with constantly​ with organisational​ suggestions that it may in fact be more like a nagging mother in-law . Or I'm just getting old and grumpy in my old age 😎 ? _jack_ You're not. Guilherme Pata Typing to the assistant as you do in Allo would be a real feature. This button doesn't do much when all you had to do before was swipe up... itsatrap It's not as good as Now on tap. demarcmj Didn't this happen like a month ago? https://www.google.com/search?q=google+assistant+%22What%27s+on+my+screen%22&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8 All the results are from around 3/15 (ish) Corbin Davenport It's been rolling out slowly. demarcmj Interesting. I figured the roll-out was about done since I have it and I never get anything early. Still, staged roll-out or not, I was surprised to see that you guys hadn't covered this already. Cakefish Still no assistant available in the UK on a non-Pixel device... hurry up Google. And bring YouTube Red over here while you're at it. Why is Google so lethargic with updates? freshprince_87 Never cared for the now on tap screenshot option. kalehv I also wish that Assistant could be dismissed by just swiping down. It shows up from bottom halfway to the top and it stretches to top when you pull it up only makes me think it could be pulled down to dismiss but .... Dan it does that if it's still on the bottom half of the screen. just tried it. kalehv Yeah but you pull it up to go all the way to top makes me think you can pull it down as well which doesn't work. Ishti Screen translation and text recognition scanning missing. Portzblitz Smart. Before, when you'd summon Assistant, whether you needed more info or not, Google would be processing at the bottom anyway even though few people ever actually swipe up for it; now, the button can be instantly available, but the processing will only happen for people who press it. Separates the task load. Michel Sa Where is the image search from Now on tap! Assistant is a step back. DC_Guy It's MUCH more useful this way. I take a lot of screenshots and i hated always having to scroll down to get to the share button. Sang Ngaihte No Assistant till now in India. Only Now on tap. Sibin C Baby I need the old text selection back....That's the only reason I'm still continuing in Google now Don Low I don't have the screenshot button on mine? mike shwilly Not sure if this is new but I'm seeing that Now on Tap started to give quick info in the bottom bar instead of just providing a search button https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e690721560ce23b223eb937de7b14c92065f3047c5e06363eb43916964c4fd82.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/304b263c01a22476cc3fc51c4858d2043b55163515084ab3920b5be441676362.png dontsh00tmesanta Just noticed it Roh_Mish There is no way to input text. I don't want to input by voice in public place. I loved being able to select text and now that's gone Alessandro i noticed one thing..... if i share the screenshot it is NOT saved in my phone, or at least into my gallery. maybe it is saved elsewhere.... or is it not saved AT ALL? could someone confirm the fact that's not saved into phone as jpg?????

[Update: Just headphones for employees] Google-branded wireless headphones show up at the FCC Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/26 10:28am PDTApr 26, 2017 82 Plus 1 on G+ 136 Share on Facebook 111 Share on Twitter Total Shares329 Google News Update 1: 2017/04/26 10:30am PDT An anonymous tipster has shed some light on what these almost certainly are. Google issues headphones to a large number of its employees, and the current model is getting quite Well this is... unexpected. We've heard whispers of a new Google Home/Google WiFi combo, and even the next Pixel devices, but nothing in the realm of audio products. Out of nowhere, a set of headphones from Google have appeared in a new FCC filing. The headphones, which are identified as 'GID5B,' are definitely a bit odd. One side has a power button, and the other a simple Google logo, both in a circle matching Google's logo colors. According to the documents, these headphones support Bluetooth connectivity - but there doesn't appear to be any mention of a microphone. As with many wireless headphones, there is an AUX connector if you don't want to mess with Bluetooth. Strangely, there is a microUSB port for charging - not USB Type-C. According to the user manual included in the FCC filing, GID5B has a 600mAh battery. It's very possible that this was filed to get clearance on the internal radio, which could later be included on a different pair of headphones. The microUSB port, lack of microphone functionality, and no Google Assistant features seems to back up this claim. It would be a bit strange for Google to release headphones without any unique functionality, using an old port. Update 1: 2017/04/26 10:30am PDT An anonymous tipster has shed some light on what these almost certainly are. Google issues headphones to a large number of its employees, and the current model is getting quite long in the tooth. We've got a picture of it below. As you can see, it bears the same power button iconography as the ones in the FCC filing above. These headphones are distributed for use only inside Google and are not sold anywhere - they're just for Googlers. This new ANC Bluetooth version is just an update on the design, probably meant to replace these older headsets as they're phased out. So, no: Google is not releasing a really ugly wireless headphone with a microUSB port and no microphone. Well, not to anyone except Googlers.

Not Google's... #facepalm FRGuzman That's actually Google's official merchandise store. Admittedly, it does look fake. It's run by a third party company that has the license to produce merchandise with G's logo, though. MJ How do we know this? Source? Why would Google use like a 3rd rate company for this? Anyone have a link from Google's website to that site? Gobelet The SSL certificate was delivered by Google themselves. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2ec49ef6e0020e3a0c8436a7f6610146bd0e573f443b2d220fc2a5baf5ed48be.png MJ Well played sir... Best proof after a half dozen comments. Again, why have a third rate looking store site that looks like crap/fake? FRGuzman I did some research on it a couple of months ago as I was looking for a Google decal and stumbled upon this website and it looked kinda shady to me too. I can't recall all the evidence I gathered but I ended up convinced it was legit. I'd say Google doesn't care too much about branded merchandising and they off loaded it to a third party company that in my opinion doesn't even offer compeling or quality looking goods. Shagnscooby Weird. I knew they had a merch store but I certainly didn't think there was electronics there that weren't on the store.google.com They must not make or design the merch ones and it's just a logo slapped on. MJ They don't... It's a fake store. Shagnscooby It's not fake. I've done telephone survey's for Google and one of the payment options was a Google Merch store gift card instead of other gift cards. MJ Google does telephone surveys? Who even answers telephone surveys or picks up on unrecognized numbers? mog386 Wrong. It's legit. Lol. You dolt. "About Robertson Marketing Robertson is Google’s branded merchandise partner in North America.

The Robertson team manages the online Google Merchandise Store and the Google campus store in Mountain View, California, and serves as a preferred provider for special order Google branded products." MJ Really? You had go with the name calling? I don't care what the fucking website says... It doesn't look legit at all. Even if they have the rights to slap the Google logo on shit they aren't Google's products. The OP was wrong about the headphones. Aaron Berlin I'm guessing those are just white label goods with Google branding on them, so GOOG wouldn't actually file with the FCC. Maybe??? MJ It's not official merchandise! It's fake! mog386 Wrong. It's legit. Lol. "About Robertson Marketing Robertson is Google’s branded merchandise partner in North America.

David Ruddock I'm sorry, but not even close. MJ LOL I beat you to it David. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I mean they are both headphones... Dan Proctor Mentioned it above but my comment was aimed at these going into their merchandise store vs a real consumer product. My company offers the same generic branded things that go through the FCC as our own products. Very common among the bigger companies of the world. David Ruddock They could, but seeing as we've never seen any headphones go through under Google's name before, I have my doubts. Dan Proctor As in these look like they will be going into this store. Same as other people have said about them being the generic items Google offers at events and to employees. David Mendívil if this thing has an internal FM radio receiver (analog), I will get one Sashank Narayan What mainstream headphones even have that capability? Justin W I can answer this: none. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And why? FM radio still exists? David Mendívil dude, not everyone lives in EEUU or EUROPE, most of the human population still hears analogical radio stations Matt It's not just a Europe thing. I live in the US and I have not listened to FM radio in years. Erstam Same. I despise analog radio. Do many commercials plus it usually sounds like crap. DanSan I don't even know where the FM radio button is in my car. /s yes i do but you get the point. David Mendívil Sorry EEUU is USA in Spanish hehe but at least in south america, it is quite common to still have the good old FM radio stations, having a data plan is still too expensive Matt Oh, right. I even know that. I think having it right next to EUROPE my brain just combined it all. podme Probably giveaways to employees and swag for events, etc Jarrett Lennon Kaufman They'd be better off rebranding OEM headphones for just that, though, and could skip this process. Mordalo I'm more concerned about the sound quality. If they sound good and don't break my bank account (or my mortgage payment), I'd be happy to get another set of good Bluetooth cans. They don't need to be always on or listening (even though this is Google). mlm5em Sees Headline: Must buy immediately Sees Mirco USB: Run away T4rd What wireless headphones (or any phone/PC accessories) have USB-C ports yet? Erstam My phone is usb c. My Chromebook only had usb c. I have a mouse and keyboard that are usb c. My battery pack is usb c. Come to the future brother. It's great!. I use the same cable to charge everything normally too. I actually had the same thought as the guy above. I'm not buying anything that's not usb c any more. It's not future proof and i rarely have to carry a non c cable anymore (except on a trip i bring an extra micro usb for my gf s7). T4rd So your mouse and keyboard.. that's pretty much it. I agree, I would only like to buy USB C accessories as well, but it seems they're not picking it up any time soon still. catalysto So you're being purposefully obtuse. T4rd Likewise. catalysto That's a yes. T4rd For you. DanSan https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5e55bc06067cf74753d28062e8aaf21244bf97f17ad555a1d4b58976f73be2bf.gif catalysto Interesting angle you took there. T4rd You trying to be (a)cute? =p Charles https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/04c3103885fe90c9fac6a716024d3ffabaa2c2d1637efd9143fe07e90fbe15f3.jpg matteventu Which USB-C mouse have you got? I was looking for one to replace my MAX Anywhere 2. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Lol. This is ridiculously ugly T4rd Headphones with Cast built in..? Could be cool. marcusmarcus2 That is the first thing I thought when I read the headline makapav That would be a pretty good idea - as long as it also has a mic for calls and gives the option for filtering in ambient sound/noise when needed. Rinkesh621 How about cast and miniature Google home, so you can order pizza, while you stream your music from your Spotify while you watch e-sport games with Picture in Picture of watching old Charlie Chaplin silent film? No.... just a though. lol SpeakethTheTruth Sounds like a Pimp My Ride episode. Lateef Alabi-Oki 600mAh battery for a headphone? What are they aiming for? A week long battery life. Jay I'd probably buy them because Google. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ 4Ui812 They'll probably have issues out of the box because .... Google ¯_(ツ)_/ Mohamed Fixaal And they'll later release 10 new headphones and change their names later in because Google.. ¯_(ツ)_/ David’s Flattop Reigns Supreme Wow, Its a trifecta of wisdom!! Diego Opazo SV-Cross ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ After that they'll release a companion app ecosystem only to abandon them altogether because ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Ray And then one model will shut down randomly with 35% battery still remaining. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ David’s Flattop Reigns Supreme even more helpful.... Nexus✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Guess I've gotten mostly lucky, my two galaxy nexus, nexus 4, 5, 7, google home, chromecasts, nexus player, and pixel didn't have problems out of the box. my 5x developed crazy slowness over time rendering it barely useful (and I've flashed all sorts of roms and formatted storage and disabled encryption). Nigel Antonio im right there with you, but ad a nexus 1. and a Pixel to the mix. Dennis Lockhart Maybe but they'll be in 'beta' so a fix is just down the road a bit. ;-) 4Ui812 LOL Andrey Simakov They are Google because Google. David’s Flattop Reigns Supreme Well that was helpfull Glen Barrington Then they'll abandon the whole thing because Google.. ¯_(ツ)_/ John Marshall’s Ghost Why isn't this USB C? I have a Pixel XL and my wife has the Nexus 5X. We have switched our lives over to USB C. Why would I want to carry around another cable or an adapter just for a set of headphones? I have not been able to find a set of USB C wireless headphones and for the life of me, I can't understand why. vmxr ugly Cael That G looks like a Q to mean. Clearly the Nexus Q2 /s Thomas Larsen It's a power button Cael I was being sarcastic... Thomas Larsen I know, even without the /s makiller The manual showing an aux cable included reinforces for me that Google will keep the headphone jack on the next Pixel again. I doubt they'd include an aux cord with their new branded headphones if their new branded phone couldn't even use it..... right? These are kind of ugly though. ITGuy11 Right. Cause your going to need that headphone jack due to Pixel 2 Bluetooth issues ¯_(ツ)_/¯ JG Counter point... That assumes everyone at Google will be using the Pixel 2. I would imagine some (especially those developing for iOS) use iPhones. And several probably carry around Galaxy devices etc... You don't have to eat McDonalds for every meal just because you work there... You're also further assuming the aux cord is to be plugged into the phone. Maybe the aux port is included so the headphones can connect to the employee's computer terminal. Or maybe the equipment in the campus gym, like at my gym, lack bluetooth and need a wired connection in order to listen to the built in TV/music player. Or since Google will only need a small quantity I would imagine it would probably have been easier and cheaper just to use parts already in production rather than asking whoever is actually building them to create custom hardware for a relatively small order. That would also explain why the charge port is microUSB and not USB-C. DanSan just curious, is there a reason why you'd expect a microphone for these? I'm just guessing here but these don't look like gaming or professional use headphones which would be the only time they might require a mic. This looks more like trying to capture the hype of other products like beats. No idea but do beats have a built in mic? I get it, maybe it would be good for assistant if it had a mic but not sure i see lack of microphone a drawback, especially when similar headphones dont have them matteventu For... Calls? DanSan do other headphones that look or fit in this same category have the same functionality? i only ask because the article is written as if not having a mic is a knock against the product yet i dont think anything else in this space has a mic. Miku is Best Vocaloid Most of them do. matteventu Aurevoir 3.5mm jack on Pixel 2. Damnit. Fr0gg0 It's not like anyone outside Google would want to wear those. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Never underestimate the power of branding. sebastianer Yeah....for less than 150€ you can get some AKG K701s headphones.(that you can mod if you need more Low frequency). And for 100 USD you can get a Schiit Fulla 2 amazing DAC and reasonable good amp. That's all you need for a decent audio quality nowadays. Tom Harman Yes Please! Jeffrey Spiers I'll be scouring Ebay for these... icyhotmike Supported for 3 months and then left dry to die a slow and unfixed death -Every Google product KRS_Won Google Listen™ Built with Cast® I'd prob buy em. Rinkesh621 Those earmuff bezels tho ! Complimentary with Pixel 2? Alfonso Surroca It's a shame this headset is internal-only. A Google headset such as this would fit nicely with their consumer product mix, especially if it only worked in conjunction with all-new dedicated messaging and voice apps. G Suite Headset Messenger by Google has a nice ring to it. Rod Moore What is this AUX you speak of? All of Goggles phones have USB-C ports. Plus the Chromebooks are coming out with USB-C. Very odd to be using a older USB auxiliary port. hzd Bluetooth Google headphones . . . Haha expect less work to get done at Google from here on in, Google's relationship with any BT is always Rocky !

Google App 7.1 beta is testing a search bar in the notification panel and may begin showing pollen counts [APK Teardown] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/04/26 5:12am PDTApr 26, 2017 64 Plus 1 on G+ 108 Share on Facebook 74 Share on Twitter Total Shares246 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Article Contents 1 Teardown 1.1 Search bar in the notification panel 1.2 Pollen counts 2 Download The Google app is responsible for a pretty staggering number of features ranging from the standard search interface, a voice assistant, and even a fully functional launcher. The latest update coming through the beta channel doesn't seem to have any new features going live quite yet, but there are a lot of changes to text and other resources, including the removal of all references to Bisto from the last teardown. Most of them are minor tweaks to features we've covered in the past, but a couple point to things we haven't explored yet. Users can look forward to pollen counts with their local weather and possibly a search bar located right in the notification shade. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. Search bar in the notification panel It looks like Google is testing a new location for the quick search bar. A new setting in the apk describes placing a "search bar in the notification panel." The setting doesn't appear to be live yet, even on the Android O developer preview, which isn't surprising since it's marked as a beta. Before you assume this is going to be just another quick access tile like the toggles for Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, let's be clear that the phrasing specifically says the search bar is in the notification panel and the word "tile" is never used. It could be worded incorrectly, which sometimes happens with unofficial features, but this sounds too specific to be a mistake. code <string name="search_notification_setting_title">Search bar (beta)</string> <string name="search_notification_setting_summary">Show quick search bar in the notification panel</string> <string name="accessibility_notification_google_search_button">Google Search</string> <string name="accessibility_notification_settings_button">Notification Settings</string> <string name="accessibility_notification_voice_search_button">Voice Search</string> res/xml/search_notification_preferences.xml <PreferenceScreen xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"> <SwitchPreference android:persistent="true" android:title="@string/search_notification_setting_title" android:key="persistent_search_notification_enabled" android:summary="@string/search_notification_setting_summary" android:defaultValue="false" /> </PreferenceScreen> Since the Android OS only allows very limited access to the UI of a notification, this probably won't be implemented as a regular notification. Contrary to the point I made above, it obviously still could be a simple quick tile that displays a search bar floating on top of whatever screen you're currently looking at. I'm going to venture another theory or two, although I admit this is crossing deeper into guesswork. This clue might suggest Google is planning to modify the notification panel itself to include a space for the search bar, possibly inserting it between the quick settings tiles and the actual notifications. I'm not sure many people would want a search bar in that spot, but it's not implausible. We can take that theory one step further, probably crossing into the realm of the unlikely, to raise the possibility Google could be planning to open up the notification panel to app developers even further and allow full-width widgets to be placed there. There are certain things that can't be done with either quick settings the tiles or regular notifications, so there is at least some justification for adding this capability, but it still feels unlikely. We might find out more about this as Android O gets closer to launch. Regardless of the specific implementation method, we can return to the original question of whether or not most users would want a search bar in the notification panel. Would it be redundant if there could already be a search bar on their launcher and long-pressing on the Home button can open up Assistant, or would this just give us another option if those don't fit our workflow? Since it's a beta, we may not get much more about this for a while. Pollen counts In my neck of the woods, as with the rest of the northern hemisphere, we're in the middle of Spring. That means we're enjoying warmer temperatures, sunnier skies, and longer days. For some, it's also time for unending fits of sneezing, itchy eyes, and all of the symptoms of hay fever. I don't personally suffer from this, but plenty of people do, and keeping tabs on the pollen count can be helpful for making plans to keep the allergies in check. Judging by a new image in the Google app, this information is about to get a little more visible. Titled ic_pollen_count.png, it's pretty clear what this flower image (that looks like it's sweating) will be used for. I expect it to show up with the standard weather predictions, much like it does on some other trackers and news outlets. It's a simple feature, but one that will surely be invaluable to millions of users around the world. Seeing as we're already in the middle of Spring, there's no better time for this information to go live, and probably could at any time. Hopefully it's sooner rather than later. Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way. Rather than wait for Google to push this download to your devices, which can take days, download and install it just like any other APK.

Filipe Santos GOOGLE, I DON'T CARE, just give me Assistant on my 6P!!! Frisi I think you should have it. Most phones have it by now. Sam I still don't have it, either :( Yash Raj Chhabra Change language to english us. Give ur phone a restart and you should have assistant. Vratislav Jindra Be glad you don't have it, Assistant sucks (at least when compared to Google Now). It can't identify songs. It broke AutoVoice (a Tasker plugin) integration. You can't type to it, you always have to speak. Long pressing home button always comes up with the assistant screen, and there is no shortcut to go to the Google App itself. I just hate it, that's all. Cody Toombs The AutoVoice plugin can kinda already be solved with IFTTT for some actions, but doesn't really give the full range of capabilities. I think that's going to get better once some of the other features for Assistant are opened up. As for speaking your input, that's already in the works. It was mentioned in a previous teardown, and I'm a bit surprised it hasn't gone live yet. (link) Tim Lewis For quickly accessing Google Now (which I use to get a quick run-down on the news), I use Action Launcher and just have a shortcut set to open the Google app when I tap the home button when I'm already on the home screen. mattcoz Yes, I hate that you can't type. I don't want to talk to my phone, especially in public. Fernando Pena I have it already... 6p, developer preview, english language. demarcmj Forgot to finish that last sentence... "Seeing as we're already in the midst of the season that could benefit from" Imparus From what? The suspens is killing me :O Cody Toombs ^ The reason I shouldn't write these on so little sleep. :) Thanks, got it fixed. I was just saying this pollen count feature could launch at any time, and probably should soon. abqnm Thanks for the teardown! Also, your sleep-writing got you again. PP 6: There are certain things that can't be done with either quick settings the titles or regular notifications... Feel free to nuke this comment after reading it. Cheers! Cody Toombs Ahh, thanks. Good catch! Trooper311 Thanks for the write up Cody. I have noticed something of late with the Google app. I thought it was because I was on beta, but I got off of beta and it still does the same thing on my Pixel XL. Also on my wife's Moto X. For the weather cards, instead of saying the town that I am in, it states the township that I am in. This travels with me wherever I am. Home, work, a store etc. Any news on this by chance? Thanks. Cody Toombs I live in a place that barely exists, so I've always been bumped into neighboring areas. For that reason, I never really notice when things like that behave abnormally. Sorry. Trooper311 It's ok man. Appreciate you hitting me back. Cheers. CasperTFG #oceans11 Carson Saldanha Search bar in the notification panel seems pretty legit to me. DragoCubed Full-width widgets in the notification bar? Yes please. Search bar in the notification bar? Not so exciting Dennis Ulijn Can the search bar in the notification panel not be a reply line, like you get in messaging apps like hangouts, messages and whatsapp? Bombaglad i imagine that could be pretty easy to implement it that way for any 3rd party dev as a separate app (please correct me if i am wrong) Multiling O Keyboard Yes, I'm thinking to add app shortcuts to it with my Renegade Launcher app. ilovetesla whats the use of a pollen counter?? Cody Toombs "Pollen counts are measured from low, meaning they affect few individuals, to high, meaning symptoms affect most allergy sufferers." source ilovetesla but, a phone counting "pollen" WTF is this tech man Sup Are you being serious right now? Red No, he's being serious next Thursday. Quint’s Sharking & Seashells Busy on Thursday, how about Friday? Cody Toombs Is this is a serious misunderstanding or are you trolling? The actual data collection happens at a facility that monitors pollen counts, and the results are then sent out for people to see on their phones. Derek Ross Pixel 2 will come with pollen sensors. You heard it here first. ilovetesla ohhhh ... OK .i thought there will be some kind of sensor in future android devices that measures pollen things dammit !!!! i'm bad Cody Toombs lol, it's cool. We all do it from time to time :) Quint’s Sharking & Seashells I know, its bad enough that a phone can tell you how much rain we get. I don't want my phone getting wet. This is nonsense and i'm talking out of my ass. Quint’s Sharking & Seashells Sorry, a little off topic, but do any of you have an issue where the weather icons do not show up in the Google Now widget? Peacen1k Been an issue over several versions, so for quite some time now. Also, only 2 rows of tiles show up, the rest of the widget space is empty. Kawshik Ahmed Maybe it will be something like this. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9abe1606e0efd2996cb434a33131a56a45a2a60b329ed1a4cec68331a778fafb.jpg 9+10=21 Nice jodieisme Thursday, July 28th..?🙈 Oasis Feng I guess the search bar in notification panel will be a normal notification with quick reply functionality as input field for quick search. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Time to start moving things to the bottom of the UI Google. #WebOs David Hyman I would be happy if it was implemented like how Textra handles the quick SMS notification. You hit the notification and the search widget appears as an overlay on top of everything else. They already have this overlay created too so it would be quick to implement in my opinion Ben Roberts I downloaded the apk but I don't see any search in the notifications Cody Toombs This is a teardown. Note the big disclaimer at the top and regular use of future tense as the feature is described. Captain_Invisible That means you have to read more than the title... Gonzales I see the search bar in the feed but not in the pull down notification, which is where I would like it. Rami I would like the search bar there, or back in overview. There's no way to easily open Google from Assistant without multiple taps, and my home screen setup has no room for a search bar.

Google's new search tools and changes could help combat fake news Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/25 10:37am PDTApr 25, 2017 18 Plus 1 on G+ 34 Share on Facebook 58 Share on Twitter Total Shares110 Google News Since time immemorial (1998) Google's bread, butter, and raison d'être has been search. Now Google's changing the way search works a bit, empowering users by adding new feedback tools and changing results from their search ranking to bring you more relevant and accurate information. With these changes users should see less in the way of so-called "fake news" and other non-factual content (excluding searches for that material), and more accurate and relevant information pertaining to their search. The biggest user-facing change you are likely to see is probably the new feedback link. It allows users to tag snippets —the short bits of text you might see that directly answer questions posed in a search —or autocomplete results as being accurate, inaccurate, offensive, or just disliked. There's no telling yet exactly how Google may or may not use the data collected via reports, but at a minimum it may go some way to prevent a few of the problems they've seen. I know in the past I've seen snippets come up that are either entirely incorrect or totally unrelated to a search. Hopefully this doesn't just present a new vector for further rank manipulation in autocomplete, though. The changes to search sorting are pretty straightforward. Google's had some problems in the past with sites manipulating how they appear on results. After all, anything that's governed by a set of rules can be gamed using those rules. Even without that Google's had some problems with factually inaccurate results appearing on top of results. They'll be making new changes to ranking to avoid that sort of thing in the future, and they're redoubling their efforts with Google's human oversight in determining quality of results. Their content policy has been updated with the details, and their educational portal on how their Search works has also been changed. Until we see how searches are changed there's no way to know if the new tools might open another means for manipulation of results. While it's possible some might use it as a means of censorship or calumny, hopefully the system is robust enough to resist that type of manipulation. Either way, we shall see.

Branko It's called free speech idiot. Now go and read 1984 before worshipping a private corporation with political interests who has the majority of search traffic. Ozl LOL M. Luciano Damn, MJ was spot on. He said you're coming and here you are! F4LL0U7 Well yesterday's March For Science post is a pretty good indication of how this comment section is about to play out... M. Luciano I must have missed it - wtf is controversial about supporting science? F4LL0U7 A lot, apparently! Check it out. http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/04/24/went-protest-app/#comment-3271548575 Sir_Brizz I think it's wrong to simplify both the "March for Science" and whatever happened in that comments section to "supporting science". Most people would agree with "supporting science" but it is rarely that simple. If you don't understand what problem a reasonably intelligent person would have had with the march or that post, then that probably warrants further investigation on your part to form your own opinions. M. Luciano I was surprised to hear that there was any controversy over the march for science. Science seems like one of the most uncontroversial things one could "march" for. The article didn't mention any controversy, unless people creating an app to collect data at protests is controversial, but then almost every app on every platform would be controversial. Nicholas Conrad It wasn't a march for science, it was just called a march for science. It was a march in support of a particular set of policy prescriptions. Anyone who really supports science would know that science can't be in favor of one policy or another, it can only inform the discussion of costs and benefits of varying policies which then have to be weighed. F4LL0U7 However, PEOPLE can choose to march for or against a cause. These people were marching *against* decisions made by the government that seem to ignore scientific research, and *for* awareness of the cause. And science can certainly favor one policy or another. For example, cutting the EPA by 30% and removing regulations that protect the environment -- it's pretty safe to say that if you consider scientific research, you would not make those decisions. Nicholas Conrad No, that's the problem. Using your personal political views as a proxy for pro/anti science is *very* anti science. F4LL0U7 Ok I'll bite. If that's the case, then what scientific arguments are there that defend the deregulation of industries that create the most pollution and damage to the environment? I'll offer my own take on it, and absolutely feel free to counter. The current administration takes the stance that those industries *don't* harm the environment significantly. They believe the harm done is outweighed by the boost they predict to employment, the economy, and their own profits. I can cite Trump's Earth Day tweets as an example of this stance. In taking that stance, they are either ignoring scientific evidence of harm to the environment, or choosing to diminish its value. That is an anti-science stance, and one of the many reasons these people marched that day. Scientists are telling the world that certain things are major priorities right now and require immediate action. When politicians ignore or deprioritize scientific evidence for the sake of their own priorities, that is anti-science. Nicholas Conrad Why is it a given that the epa is optimal at it's current funding levels, do you have evidence, or are you assuming because you like what they stand for? And trump isn't targeting the epa specifically, he's spoken out against the larger 'regulatory state'. It's perfectly coherent to argue that laws should be passed by congress, not unelected bureaucrats (working under the executive branch, bt-dubs, so shrinking the regulatory state actually diminishes trumps power while increasing democratic engagement in policy making... you'd think it was something we should all be able to get behind) even if there are some good ones on the books that will temporarily be displaced. But the real issue is your (and the marchers', and for that matter the general pubic's) confusion between the statements "science says" and "scientists say". It's a cheap *appeal to authority* fallacy, one which, when questioned about it scientists usually (very conveniently​) say 'well yes, but it doesn't count when *we*'re the authority'. Then you look at the structure of modern academic 'science', where advances in computer-aided statistical analysis, paired with clever research design allow researchers to almost guarantee a 'significant' result, which is important because their carriers depend on *publishing*, not on finding truth. So much so that a full 2/3rds of 'peer reviewed' studies don't hold up under replication. Science *is* self-correcting, but on the time scale of decades and centuries, not months and years, so whatever cause du jour is backed up by 'the latest studies' is most likely to be wrong. If people are really interested in supporting *science* they should be marching on campuses demanding more rigor in academic publishing standards which were established centuries ago, not marching for x or y policy, about which science is agnostic. F4LL0U7 I certainly respect your argument, and greatly appreciate your well thought out points (in stark contrast to the insult-spewing posts of some other commenters on here). But I respectfully disagree with you. The sentiment that laws should be passed by Congress and not unelected bureaucrats is sound. You can definitely make the claim that the Trump administration is advocating for deregulation for selfless reasons. But you seem like an intelligent person -- do you really believe that? Trump has not divested from his businesses, and his appointees and friends will directly benefit from deregulation. Isn't it much more likely that they care more about their profitability than the environment? You're discounting the validity of scientific research due to perceived flaws in the system (which is a reasonable thing to do), but failing to acknowledge the common sense that's so obvious when you follow the money. Humans have come to rely heavily on industries that pollute the environment. That pollution has very real negative effects on the environment. You can doubt the validity of that all you want -- those effects can be seen with your own eyes. (What do you think causes the smog in Beijing? Do you think it's nothing to worry about?) In order to stop and hopefully reverse some of that damage, those industries must be regulated. They certainly can't be trusted to regulate themselves. The US has it better than other countries, but can and should be a world leader on this front. The people invested most heavily in those polluting industries have the most to lose from regulation. Those people now have the ear of those in charge (and in many cases, actually are the ones in charge). They will continue to make decisions in the best interest of their industries, as opposed to the environment. That is how science gets politicized, and why scientific facts get challenged by people in these industries. Science should always be challenged and tested, but for purposes of advancement, and not spun for profit. Of course they're not going to come out and say it's for the benefit of their own bottom line. They're going to pay their own scientists to come up with research that supports their own agenda, and then lobby friendly politicians to vote in their favor. Have you ever wondered why cigarettes are still legal? Nicholas Conrad Look, reasonable people can disagree, or at least they used to be able to (I think we're doing a fine job). So your argument is: "trump likes corporate profits at the expense of the environment, and I like the environment at the expense of corporate profits". That's fine, I agree with you, but those are both preferences people can have and science doesn't take sides there. All science says is: 'one way the Earth will warm slower, the other way global wealth will rise slower.' Personally I think our grandchildren will be better equipped to deal with the consequences of global warming with a few extra trillion in global GDP than a few degrees Celsius shaved off the average global temperature. Those are trade-offs science can help define, but ultimately people can prefer different outcomes without being 'anti science'. Is trump a scumbag? Certainly. Is he an idiot? For sure. Does that mean that supporting the opposite of his views is inherently pro-science? Not remotely. As to your point about oil company studies that fossil fuels don't contribute to global warming, or tabacco company studies showing no link between cigarettes and cancer, because there's an inherent conflict of interest, I'd say you're right to be skeptical. Even with no funny business on the part of the scientists involved, we know that subtle factors (like who signs your paycheck) influences the outcome of research. Agreed? Good. Why then do we not examine the conflict of interests of government funded studies that consistently suggest the agency that funded them should have more power and funding? M. Luciano Furthermore, a Google search for "March for Science Controversy" turns up no controversy. Just a bunch of articles explaining who and what is going on. Is there an actual controversy? People supporting the scientific method and it's application to the challenges of our current world and society... that's not controversial. abc The controversy is that these morons think climate change is a Chinese hoax, and science (and frankly common sense) tell us that it's not. So controversy!! Sir_Brizz I don't know if there really is a controversy. However, I didn't find many of the signs people were holding to be very pro-Science even though they presumed to be. It kind of snipes any "movement" when there isn't really a consistent message and people are undermining it by their own stupidity. Nicholas Conrad Clearly a media conspiracy; is mj lamestream? MJ The first of the manipulated BLOCKED!

David Warthen We must get rid of the fake news so you can be inundated with all the real news that's completely made up. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ As long as I can filter out /r/the_donald I think that will take care of the majority of it. F4LL0U7 Heads up, a handful of users you've never seen on AP before are about to rain their barely literate rantings upon you. As an example, check out the March For Science post from yesterday. A Person People who attend science marches only push their belief in science when it suits their interests, not when it comes to male is male and female is female. M. Luciano Did that make sense when you wrote it? A Person Yes, it makes sense. M. Luciano What exactly is the scientific understanding of the relationships between sex and gender? We could try sociological, biological and psychological. Let us know when you're ready to read up on the hundreds of peer reviewed studies and provide an analysis. F4LL0U7 People who say things like that have likely never had a child, relative, or friend who turned out to be trans. And even if you haven't, why not try having a little empathy? Life might be more enjoyable, and you might be less angry at things that have absolutely no impact on you whatsoever. A Person That is very selfish of you to enforce others believe or acknowledge something simply because you yourself have experienced. If you have a friend, child, or relative that thinks they should have been the opposite sex, and you didn't attempt to get them psychiatric help, then you dropped the ball. F4LL0U7 I'm sure I should just block you and end this waste of time, but I'll ask anyway: do you think homosexuals need psychiatric help as well, or do you think that's a valid way for a person to live their life? A Person I'm sorry, do all homosexuals think you can switch back and forth between male or female, or whatever other gender you want to make up? If that is the case, then we can talk. I see "other person typing"... but sorry, I'm out... you people are batsh!t crazy. fijisiv Dude keep it up. I have never seen somebody so proud of their ignorance! Is it painful to watch? Is it sad? Is it humorous? Yes. F4LL0U7 Really? Never? (Had to bring it all back around to Devin's OP) https://az616578.vo.msecnd.net/files/responsive/embedded/any/desktop/2016/07/30/636055042891058227364682665_2.jpg Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Kudos to you and @disqus_DIvkrvAJjQ:disqus for attempting to educate @disqus_abcdefg:disqus, but sadly it seems they would rather hide in their little hole and pretend the world is black and white. F4LL0U7 Hahah, thanks! Where were you? Your body was ready, and we needed you! Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ I had meetings all day and kind of forgot since all the responses came off your comment and not mine so I got no emails! F4LL0U7 Haha, I'm just kidding. I do it to myself -- I enjoy it! Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Reading over everything really just wants me to respond to some of the comments but I know it'd be futile. Alas. F4LL0U7 You'd have to take a survey. But I would bet that most of them would be open to modern science, empathy, and leaving people the hell alone. That question was just a litmus test for your level of tolerance to other humans that may or may not fall into your perfect worldview. Sir_Brizz I'll vote for leaving people alone, although that is something that is rarely afforded to others. Nathan Walters You're the one refusing to acknowledge empirical evidence and human experience. Pot, meet kettle. MJ Holy Crap! I could have sworn that I BLOCKED (fixed) you long ago. Dude, stop with your endless ignorant comments. You have never said anything resembling intelligence on any subject here. Are people really this dumb or are most of them actually just trolls? Impossible to tell or know I guess... F4LL0U7 If you're out, does that mean you're not coming back, and I don't have to bother blocking you? Nathan Walters Wait, do you even know what science has to say about issues of biological sex? I'm guessing not. A Person Science says there are two genders, not Facebook's 58... or whatever count they're up to now. F4LL0U7 Sure, if the most recent science book you've read is the bible. A Person LOL... I haven't said anything about the bible. You're a guy or a girl and whatever logic you want to make up in order to twist two genders into 50+... well, let me get my popcorn. M. Luciano This is just as false as it was 4 minutes ago. Most people are a guy or a girl or both, but some are neither. F4LL0U7 I'll refer you to @disqus_DIvkrvAJjQ:disqus's post above, since they've already done the research, and I have to get back to work. Si vis pacem, para bellum So, you believe in Evolution right? What about talking about races then, is it OK or are races "a social construct"..? Assuming you believe in the existence of races, are we all physically and mentally equal? What are the differences, both physically *and mentally*, between the races? You say you believe in science and you also say that there is nothing wrong in the Social Justice agenda. The 2 are just as incompatible as science and believing in Biblical literalism. M. Luciano You're wrong. "Science" holds 8 known sexes and three known genders. The sexes are X0, XX, XY, ZZ, ZW, WW, Hermaphrodite and asexual. The genders are male, female and neuter. This does not include chromosomal anomalies, such as XXY, XXYY, X and XXX. A Person lol... This is like if I were to argue that "tires can only be round", so your argument becomes "round isn't the only shape". M. Luciano No, it's as if you said, "people are male or female" and then I stated that the scientific understanding is that people are one of eight sexes and one of three genders. Because that's what actually happened. So you were incorrect because you were ignorant of the actual information available to you, now that you have it, you can learn. A Person Dude, I brought up gender and you brought up sex. Why do SJWs like yourself feel it necessary to complicate things as much as possible? M. Luciano You used them interchangeably with Nathan Walters, so figured you wanted to know that they're different. But even if you want to stick to gender only, there are 3, not 2. A Person I didn't use them interchangeably. I brought up gender. He then brought up sex. I didn't bring up sex. This is ridiculous. M. Luciano He brought up sex, you then referred to it as gender ... either way, 3 > 2. And either way, it has absolutely nothing to do with the overall topic of search results. F4LL0U7 The world is complicated, dude. And if something as simple as rethinking your pronouns can make life a little less complicated for people who are having a hard enough time as it is, then why not do it? In your mind, is being a Social Justice Warrior a bad thing? Seems like fighting for social justice is something to be proud of. F4LL0U7 More accurately, it's as if you said "tires are the only things that allow vehicles to move" and then @disqus_DIvkrvAJjQ:disqus cited tank treads, skis, wings, and propellors as other examples. A Person You're right, he/she/ze/it/them/they sounds even crazier when you put it that way. F4LL0U7 Maybe this concept wouldn't be so difficult for you if you spoke another language. Most other languages besides English have gender-neutral pronouns. If English did, then maybe you wouldn't be so offended by having to consider someone's gender identity before referring to them. Si vis pacem, para bellum "Most languages"..? Which are all of these many languages..? To my knowledge it's English that has a gender neutral pronoun ("it"), in my mother tongue, Italian, and in the others derived from Latin like the French, Spanish, Portuguese and Romanian languages, *everything* has either a male or female gender. For example a chair is female, a table male, the language is male, a word female... Also, the ZW chromosomal system is only for birds and some fish and insects, there are only 2 sex chromosomes in humans and the other mammals and you correctly call chromosomal *anomalies* (which are also very rare) any combination which doesn't produce either a male or a female. A person born with 3 legs does not mean that the human species has either 2 or 3 legs... abc Sure. Let's face it you're too stupid to know what a chromosome is. So let's stick to fixing tires . Nathan Walters There aren't even only 2 sexes, why should the existence of more genders come as any surprise? abc lol. Google hermaphrodites. I love when a moron claims science backs up his opinion, when it's so obvious to a 5th grade science student that you're a numbskull.

Because diversity of thought is like fascist and stuff. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ It's one thing to think differently, it's another to spread false information. C Lo What could possibly go wrong... Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Bahahahahaha! As if I trust Google. I tried this myself with Google vs. Duckduckgo, searching for "Hillary Clinton is a". The results for Google have changed slightly, but they're still flattering. Duckduckgo still suggests criminal, liar, crook, murderer, etc. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/50818a751a00330950eceeca37a2b4d6b8f74ee8691ca9854e4ade9962a6264e.jpg F4LL0U7 Try that with any person in Google and you'll see the same discrepancy. Google already explained this (several months ago, welcome to the party!). They don't associate people's names with negative words in autocomplete. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ That's funny, because I get "Donald Trump is a" cheeto, dinosaur, democrat (now THAT is an insult) on Google. In fact, I get a lot of insulting suggestions for other people. "Bill O'Reilly is a" wife beater? So your explanation does not pass the smell test. F4LL0U7 You won't get suggestions about Trump being a liar (despite video evidence) or a crook (despite him settling out of court for defrauding attendees of his "university"). Google simply does not suggest terms like that. Here's an idea -- Google it. It was in the news almost a year ago. Doby Gillis Seems you need to look up safe space since you're acting like a special, little, snowflake. Bruce Wayne Google is notoriously liberal so it's no surprise that they suppress negative comments about a liberal former presidential candidate and boost negative comments about a Republican president. I just looked up "Hillary Clinton is a..." and I got democrat, war hawk, hologram and hero. I did the same for Trump and got dinosaur, cheeto, gemini etc. And Google expects us to trust them with filtering for "fake news". HA! F4LL0U7 If that's how you're using Google, you're doing it wrong. Google filters out suggestions tying a person's name to crimes and obscenity. This was all over tech news a year ago. I would expect Bruce Wayne to be on top of things like this. If you don't like Google's search results, use a different search engine. Scott Will the Google App get search tools?? D.Smithee How about they combat the absolute deluge of fake reviews in the Play Store. Geezus. Stormprobe But Google is a liberal company, so they are for fake news. Teppka You do not need Google to protect yourself from fake news. Just stop watching-reading CNN, BBC and other neocon-controlled media.

The upcoming device, which comes with the model number GID5B, looks like simple on-ear headphones with a rather bland design. The headphones can be adjusted up and down, while the cups come with really thick padding. What’s clearly shown is Google’s “G” logo inside a circle with the company’s signature colors on each headphone. The device was first spotted on the FCC website by Liliputing. The upcoming Google headphones also come with an active noise-canceling feature, which is a method of reducing ambient noise using a power source. The feature can be activated by pressing the ANC button which sits beside the power switch. The GID5B Google headphones also come with a 3.5mm headphone jack and an auxiliary cable so users can switch from wireless to wired listening. There’s also a micro-USB port for charging, the volume up/down buttons, a microphone for phone calls and a multifunction button for answering, rejecting or ending calls. As for internal specs, the Google Bluetooth headphones come with 40mm dynamic drivers and a 600 mAh battery. The FCC filing indicated the headphones have a battery life of up to 25 hours on Bluetooth without ANC, up to 16 hours if ANC is turned on or up to 10 hours when listening on maximum volume. People might be wondering why Google would make its own pair of headphones when there already are a bunch on the market. An anonymous tipster told Android Police the headphones are actually intended for Google employees. Google actually issues headphones to a large number of its employees and the one that they're currently using is already quite old. As seen in the picture below, the current headphones that Googlers are using bears most of the same design language seen in the photos shared by the FCC. This might also explain why the FCC wasn't so secretive about the device; it won't be sold to consumers.

Take that same photo, they challenged him, but with a smartphone camera instead. He accepted, and succeeded. The results of his experiment just went up on the Google Research blog, and they have photo lovers everywhere salivating at the low light smartphone possibilities. In essence, Kainz applied the same techniques that Google’s HDR+ camera mode uses to take better low light shots… and kicked them up several notches. HDR+ takes 10 frames in quick succession, blending them to help get rid of noise; so Kainz’s custom-built a camera app that lets him set exposure time, ISO, and focal distance… and then captures 64 frames. “When the shutter button is pressed the app waits a few seconds and then records up to 64 frames with the selected settings,” writes Kainz. “The app saves the raw frames captured from the sensor as DNG files, which can later be downloaded onto a PC for processing.” When he wanted to up the ante even further, he would shoot an addition 32 black frames shot by covering the phone camera with adhesive tape. Then he subtracted the mean of those frames from his original blended photo, thus removing the “faint grid-like patterns caused by local variations in the sensor’s black level.” Which brings us to the main event… did it work? And the answer is a resounding yes: He captured both photos above (and several more) using a Nexus 6P and his custom-built app. Depending on the amount of light, more or less frames and processing was involved, but all of his final frames were impressive to say the least. This, while still being limited to a max exposure time of 2 seconds per frame, and being forced to increase ISO to compensate. You can see all of his final images and read about the technology in more depth on the Google Research blog, where Florian’s conclusions are straightforward: Trying to find out if phone cameras might be suitable for outdoor nighttime photography was a fun experiment, and clearly the result is yes, they are. […] with the right software a phone should be able to process the images internally, and if steps such as painting layer masks by hand can be eliminated, it might be possible to do point-and-shoot photography in very low light conditions. No word on when this level of low-light photography will make it to smartphones, but we’ll be crossing our fingers that it is very soon. Image credits: Photographs by Florian Kainz/Google.

It's not a clear-cut answer. Truth is, brand loyalty is counter-productive. You should revisit your options regularly to see if maybe something better exists. Read More . If you’re looking for something that’s out of the box or if you have privacy concerns with the above options, the new Brave browser might be for you. Let’s take a look at what this app features and why it’s been gaining popularity lately. What Is Brave? Visit Brave at its official website and you’ll see that it’s built on two promises — speed and security. According to the developers (headed by Mozilla co-founder Brendan Eich), both improvements come from the browser blocking ads and trackers. Because it doesn’t have to spend as much time loading all the extra tracking and advertising information, it can load pages more quickly. As you likely know, blocking all the intrusive ads means you don’t compromise your privacy as greatly. Of course, blocking ads means that the sites you love don’t get paid It's About Ethics in Stealing Games Journalism: Why AdBlock Needs to Die It's About Ethics in Stealing Games Journalism: Why AdBlock Needs to Die A simple, free browser plugin killed Joystiq – and is ruining the Internet. Read More , which creates a real problem for the internet. To fix this, Brave lets you set up micro-payments to the sites you care about. It also has a system in place to replace “bad ads” with non-annoying Brave ads, which are less intrusive for the user but also pay the website. Finally, Brave is open source Open Source vs. Free Software: What's the Difference and Why Does It Matter? Open Source vs. Free Software: What's the Difference and Why Does It Matter? Many assume "open source" and "free software" mean the same thing but that's not true. It's in your best interest to know what the differences are. Read More , so they encourage anyone who wants to contribute to do so. The developers are striving for a browser that’s made for the modern web, not one in the interests of big companies. Those who prefer Firefox over Chrome for its commitment to a better web should find Brave attractive because of this. We’ve seen the promise of Brave, but let’s find out what using it is like. Meeting Brave Browser Head to the Brave downloads page to grab the browser for your system. Brave is available on Windows, Mac, and Linux, as well as Android and iOS. After a painless installation, you’ll see the main Brave page: Brave is based on Chromium, and while it’s not identical, it has some similarities in the same way Opera does. Head to the Settings menu by clicking the small three-dot menu at the top-right of the window, then clicking Settings. You’ll find some basic settings like home page and default search engine, but Brave also includes a few cool settings you should know about. Brave’s Options On the General tab, you can choose between three ways to display the Bookmarks Bar. By default it’s set to Text only, which is like Safari. But you can choose Favicons only to save space and identify bookmarks by their icons. The Search tab contains many built-in search engines. Google is the default search engine, but you should probably switch this to DuckDuckGo Why This Longtime Google Fan Now Prefers DuckDuckGo Why This Longtime Google Fan Now Prefers DuckDuckGo Most of us don't remember life before Google search. Try DuckDuckGo. Learn its tricks. There could be nothing you miss about Google. Read More if you’re concerned about privacy.

But DuckDuckGo has earned a loyal fan following. It has a few unusual features that even Google doesn't have. Read More to boot. Give it a try if you haven’t already. You can search other sites, like Amazon, Wikipedia, and Twitter, with a quick shortcut in brave. For instance, type :a Towels to search Amazon for towels. Tabs is the next category. You can choose how many tabs are in a “set” here — open more than that number, and you’ll add a new page of tabs in your browser. This lets you keep track of lots of tabs without extra clutter. Another neat default feature allows you to see a preview of another tab when you mouse over it. You’ve probably used incognito windows Not Just for Porn: Other Uses For Private Browsing Not Just for Porn: Other Uses For Private Browsing Private-browsing mode has many other names, including "incognito mode" in Chrome and "InPrivate Browsing" in Internet Explorer. Some people refer to private-browsing mode as "porn mode", but it isn't just for porn addicts. It can... Read More to sign into a different account without having to sign out of yours. Brave takes this feature further and allows you to open Session Tabs from the three-dot menu. A session tab essentially runs a fresh browser inside that tab. So if you’re signed into Gmail and switch to a new session tab, Gmail is a blank slate there. This lets you manage several accounts at once. Use the Security tab to set up Brave to always delete your browsing data on exit. You can also configure Brave’s built-in password manager or enable 1Password, Dashlane, or LastPass if you use one of those. The Sync tab hosts Brave’s capability to securely sync your data between devices. As you’d guess, Plugins isn’t too exciting. It lets you enable Flash Player (which is thankfully going out the window) and Google Widevine DRM. Set up the default Shield settings on its tab. You can choose to Block Ads (default), Allow Ads and Tracking, or Show Brave Ads. Brave will Block 3rd Party Cookies by default, but you can choose to allow all cookies or block all cookies too. It also includes HTTPS Everywhere — an essential security extension — functionality built-in and ready by default. Brave Payments We’ve skipped over the most important tab to cover it in more detail: Brave Payments. This is the company’s answer to keeping websites paid even when you’re blocking ads. Toggle this option on, and you’ll be asked to fund a wallet with a few dollars. This money pays out in small increments to the sites you visit whose ads you block, and keeps your browsing anonymous unlike the current ad system. You can set a monthly budget of $5–$20 so you don’t go overboard in payments. If you choose to pay, you can add funds using a credit/debit card or via Bitcoin What Are Bitcoins Actually Used For Now in 2016? What Are Bitcoins Actually Used For Now in 2016? Bitcoin has been on the up-and-up for several years now, but is it viable as a currency yet? What exactly can you buy with it right now? Read More . As you browse, the Payments page will collect data about which sites you visit and how long you’ve spent on them. If you visit a site that you’d prefer not to pay, you can switch it off. At the end of each month, Brave takes the money that you’ve provided and splits it according to the sites you visit most. Ad Behavior By default, Brave blocks ads, which is why you’re encouraged to pay as replacement. However, they have another trick, called Brave Ads. Under the Shields settings tab, if you choose to Show Brave Ads, the browser will substitute its own “clean” ads to replace the “bad” ones. These ads are anonymous and don’t track you like regular ads do. They also don’t come with huge load time increases like standard ads. At the time of writing, enabling this option just shows a placeholder where the ad should be with a Coming Soon message. Brave invites you to read their ad replacement page for more information on how they plan to implement this. However, Brave’s ad-blocking does speed up your browsing (most of the time). The browser keeps a log of how many seconds it has saved you, and we’ve benchmarked the speed for both the mobile and Windows versions of Brave. You set the default shield behavior in the Settings panel as described above, but you can toggle them on a per-site basis, too. On any website, click the Brave lion icon in the top-right of the window, next to the Minimize button. Here, you can see how many ads and trackers Brave blocked, as well as the amount of connections that it upgraded to HTTPS. To totally disable shields for a website, slide the Shields slider to Down. If you’d rather change a specific setting, expand Advanced Controls. You can change the setting for which ads to show, which cookies to block, and whether Brave should force an HTTPS connection. The Major Drawback By now, you’ve likely spotted one of Brave’s major drawbacks — it doesn’t support extensions. If you’re coming from Chrome and its vast library of add-ons The Best Chrome Extensions The Best Chrome Extensions A list of the best extensions for Google Chrome, including suggestions from both our readers and our writers. Read More , this is shocking. However, a password manager and ad blocker are the most important extensions you probably use in other browsers — those are already included here. Hopefully Brave adds full extension support soon, but in the meantime you’ll have to decide whether the advanced protection is worth giving up add-ons for. Aside from what we’ve discussed above, there’s not much more to Brave. It’s a polished program, but the lack of a few major features make it hard to recommend as your main browser. Zero extensions means that you’re better off using Brave for occasional speedy browsing and not for your everyday work. However, if you’re privacy-conscious, you might appreciate the lack of extensions. After all, Chrome can’t control how third-party extensions use your data, and many of them have abused it 10 Chrome Extensions You Should Uninstall Right Now 10 Chrome Extensions You Should Uninstall Right Now It's hard to keep track of which extensions have been caught abusing their privileges, but you should definitely uninstall these 10 as soon as possible.

We’ll see if Brave’s alternative ad model Why the Fight Back Against Ad-Blockers Should Matter to You Now Why the Fight Back Against Ad-Blockers Should Matter to You Now Ad-blocking has changed our browsing experience. The fightback by web publishers is changing it further. But if they defeat ad-blocking, what does it mean for the future of our Internet experience? Read More works out. In theory, it’s a great idea to make ads less awful. It’s hard to imagine most decent people being opposed to giving $10 per month to the sites they visit often in order to see fewer trashy ads. But several parties have to buy into this method for it to work properly, which is asking a lot. If you’re an AdBlock user, Brave lets you continue to strip out ads without the guilt that comes from depriving websites of revenue. Those looking for something different just for fun of it should enjoy Brave. Power users probably won’t convert yet, but everyone else should at least give it a download.

I think at the year 2017 users now should now that if their browser supports new technology or not, even these are not new. Is this browser support service workers? new API's like fetch, pay etc. or is this support PWA things like add to home screen? This browser is fast, wow very good ok better then chrome wow Reply Mike S. April 26, 2017 at 8:03 pm This will be difficult to swallow for most sites. They would now have to share revenue with Brave and aren't showing the ads they get paid 100% (clicks, views, etc.) to show. Big media is not overly fond of change they don't implement or control. They could be potentially paid more overall if it caught on though. If it did it would likely become fractured as other browser tried the same model. If I am making micro-payments as part of the browsing process, why show ads at all? It would be more like paying for ad-free content. I'm all for that if the price is right and I don't need to have create accounts on a load of different sites in order to access content. I think most people hit a few regular sites and the rest are just due to following links. Nobody want to create an account to read a single article. I have been using Brave a bit lately and find it a bit less polished than established browsers but it works well and is improving.

Google said Wednesday that Google Maps now supports saving car parking information so drivers can more easily find their cars. After parking, mobile users can tap on a blue button in the Google Maps app that will trigger a “Save Your Parking” message, which they then need to press again to log the spot. Once Google Maps has saved the location data, drivers can add additional details, such as which level within the parking garage their car located. Google said people who park in front of parking meters can also note how much time they paid for, and Google will send a notification 15 minutes prior to the meter’s expiring. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. A driver can also take a picture of his or her parking spot using the phone’s camera and send that photo to friends. The search giant didn’t say if people could share their parking photos on other third-party social networks like Facebook (fb) or Twitter (twtr). The new parking feature is available on both the Android and Apple iOS apps for Google Maps.

Essentially any dish you can think of, Google Assistant and Google Home can now walk you through the cooking process step by step. To get started, you’ll want to ask Assistant on your phone for a recipe. Once you find some inspiration, you should probably head to the store and pick up what you’ll need. At that point, you can send the recipe to Google Home, which can then read off the instructions one at a time. If you need to repeat something, just ask Google to repeat the last step. Here are the steps that Google lists. Step 1: Pick a recipe! Go to the Google Assistant on your Android phone or to Google Search (iOS or Android) and find a recipe. Once you pick your favorite, select the “Send to Google Home” button. Step 2: Once you’re ready to cook, just say “Ok Google, start cooking” or “Ok Google, start recipe.” Step 3: Gather your ingredients. Step 4: All while you’re following the recipe, you can play your favorite music, ask about conversions (teaspoons to tablespoons, tablespoons to cups — who can remember that stuff?) and set a timer or two. Step 5: Enjoy your meal! Easy enough, right? Google states that this feature will rollout over the course of this week. If you don’t have it yet, just wait a day or two and it shall arrive.

[Update: Just headphones for employees] Google-branded wireless headphones show up at the FCC Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/26 10:28am PDTApr 26, 2017 82 Plus 1 on G+ 136 Share on Facebook 111 Share on Twitter Total Shares329 Google News Update 1: 2017/04/26 10:30am PDT An anonymous tipster has shed some light on what these almost certainly are. Google issues headphones to a large number of its employees, and the current model is getting quite Well this is... unexpected. We've heard whispers of a new Google Home/Google WiFi combo, and even the next Pixel devices, but nothing in the realm of audio products. Out of nowhere, a set of headphones from Google have appeared in a new FCC filing. The headphones, which are identified as 'GID5B,' are definitely a bit odd. One side has a power button, and the other a simple Google logo, both in a circle matching Google's logo colors. According to the documents, these headphones support Bluetooth connectivity - but there doesn't appear to be any mention of a microphone. As with many wireless headphones, there is an AUX connector if you don't want to mess with Bluetooth. Strangely, there is a microUSB port for charging - not USB Type-C. According to the user manual included in the FCC filing, GID5B has a 600mAh battery. It's very possible that this was filed to get clearance on the internal radio, which could later be included on a different pair of headphones. The microUSB port, lack of microphone functionality, and no Google Assistant features seems to back up this claim. It would be a bit strange for Google to release headphones without any unique functionality, using an old port. Update 1: 2017/04/26 10:30am PDT An anonymous tipster has shed some light on what these almost certainly are. Google issues headphones to a large number of its employees, and the current model is getting quite long in the tooth. We've got a picture of it below. As you can see, it bears the same power button iconography as the ones in the FCC filing above. These headphones are distributed for use only inside Google and are not sold anywhere - they're just for Googlers. This new ANC Bluetooth version is just an update on the design, probably meant to replace these older headsets as they're phased out. So, no: Google is not releasing a really ugly wireless headphone with a microUSB port and no microphone. Well, not to anyone except Googlers.

Not Google's... #facepalm FRGuzman That's actually Google's official merchandise store. Admittedly, it does look fake. It's run by a third party company that has the license to produce merchandise with G's logo, though. MJ How do we know this? Source? Why would Google use like a 3rd rate company for this? Anyone have a link from Google's website to that site? Gobelet The SSL certificate was delivered by Google themselves. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2ec49ef6e0020e3a0c8436a7f6610146bd0e573f443b2d220fc2a5baf5ed48be.png MJ Well played sir... Best proof after a half dozen comments. Again, why have a third rate looking store site that looks like crap/fake? FRGuzman I did some research on it a couple of months ago as I was looking for a Google decal and stumbled upon this website and it looked kinda shady to me too. I can't recall all the evidence I gathered but I ended up convinced it was legit. I'd say Google doesn't care too much about branded merchandising and they off loaded it to a third party company that in my opinion doesn't even offer compeling or quality looking goods. Shagnscooby Weird. I knew they had a merch store but I certainly didn't think there was electronics there that weren't on the store.google.com They must not make or design the merch ones and it's just a logo slapped on. MJ They don't... It's a fake store. Shagnscooby It's not fake. I've done telephone survey's for Google and one of the payment options was a Google Merch store gift card instead of other gift cards. MJ Google does telephone surveys? Who even answers telephone surveys or picks up on unrecognized numbers? mog386 Wrong. It's legit. Lol. You dolt. "About Robertson Marketing Robertson is Google’s branded merchandise partner in North America.

MJ Really? You had go with the name calling? I don't care what the fucking website says... It doesn't look legit at all. Even if they have the rights to slap the Google logo on shit they aren't Google's products. The OP was wrong about the headphones. Aaron Berlin I'm guessing those are just white label goods with Google branding on them, so GOOG wouldn't actually file with the FCC. Maybe??? MJ It's not official merchandise! It's fake! mog386 Wrong. It's legit. Lol. "About Robertson Marketing Robertson is Google’s branded merchandise partner in North America.

David Ruddock I'm sorry, but not even close. MJ LOL I beat you to it David. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I mean they are both headphones... Dan Proctor Mentioned it above but my comment was aimed at these going into their merchandise store vs a real consumer product. My company offers the same generic branded things that go through the FCC as our own products. Very common among the bigger companies of the world. David Ruddock They could, but seeing as we've never seen any headphones go through under Google's name before, I have my doubts. Dan Proctor As in these look like they will be going into this store. Same as other people have said about them being the generic items Google offers at events and to employees. David Mendívil if this thing has an internal FM radio receiver (analog), I will get one Sashank Narayan What mainstream headphones even have that capability? Justin W I can answer this: none. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And why? FM radio still exists? David Mendívil dude, not everyone lives in EEUU or EUROPE, most of the human population still hears analogical radio stations Matt It's not just a Europe thing. I live in the US and I have not listened to FM radio in years. Erstam Same. I despise analog radio. Do many commercials plus it usually sounds like crap. DanSan I don't even know where the FM radio button is in my car. /s yes i do but you get the point. David Mendívil Sorry EEUU is USA in Spanish hehe but at least in south america, it is quite common to still have the good old FM radio stations, having a data plan is still too expensive Matt Oh, right. I even know that. I think having it right next to EUROPE my brain just combined it all. podme Probably giveaways to employees and swag for events, etc Jarrett Lennon Kaufman They'd be better off rebranding OEM headphones for just that, though, and could skip this process. Mordalo I'm more concerned about the sound quality. If they sound good and don't break my bank account (or my mortgage payment), I'd be happy to get another set of good Bluetooth cans. They don't need to be always on or listening (even though this is Google). mlm5em Sees Headline: Must buy immediately Sees Mirco USB: Run away T4rd What wireless headphones (or any phone/PC accessories) have USB-C ports yet? Erstam My phone is usb c. My Chromebook only had usb c. I have a mouse and keyboard that are usb c. My battery pack is usb c. Come to the future brother. It's great!. I use the same cable to charge everything normally too. I actually had the same thought as the guy above. I'm not buying anything that's not usb c any more. It's not future proof and i rarely have to carry a non c cable anymore (except on a trip i bring an extra micro usb for my gf s7). T4rd So your mouse and keyboard.. that's pretty much it. I agree, I would only like to buy USB C accessories as well, but it seems they're not picking it up any time soon still. catalysto So you're being purposefully obtuse. T4rd Likewise. catalysto That's a yes. T4rd For you. DanSan https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5e55bc06067cf74753d28062e8aaf21244bf97f17ad555a1d4b58976f73be2bf.gif catalysto Interesting angle you took there.

I was looking for one to replace my MAX Anywhere 2. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Lol. This is ridiculously ugly T4rd Headphones with Cast built in..? Could be cool. marcusmarcus2 That is the first thing I thought when I read the headline makapav That would be a pretty good idea - as long as it also has a mic for calls and gives the option for filtering in ambient sound/noise when needed. Rinkesh621 How about cast and miniature Google home, so you can order pizza, while you stream your music from your Spotify while you watch e-sport games with Picture in Picture of watching old Charlie Chaplin silent film? No.... just a though. lol SpeakethTheTruth Sounds like a Pimp My Ride episode. Lateef Alabi-Oki 600mAh battery for a headphone? What are they aiming for? A week long battery life. Jay I'd probably buy them because Google. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ 4Ui812 They'll probably have issues out of the box because .... Google ¯_(ツ)_/ Mohamed Fixaal And they'll later release 10 new headphones and change their names later in because Google.. ¯_(ツ)_/ David’s Flattop Reigns Supreme Wow, Its a trifecta of wisdom!! Diego Opazo SV-Cross ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ After that they'll release a companion app ecosystem only to abandon them altogether because ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Ray And then one model will shut down randomly with 35% battery still remaining. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ David’s Flattop Reigns Supreme even more helpful.... Nexus✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Guess I've gotten mostly lucky, my two galaxy nexus, nexus 4, 5, 7, google home, chromecasts, nexus player, and pixel didn't have problems out of the box. my 5x developed crazy slowness over time rendering it barely useful (and I've flashed all sorts of roms and formatted storage and disabled encryption). Nigel Antonio im right there with you, but ad a nexus 1. and a Pixel to the mix. Dennis Lockhart Maybe but they'll be in 'beta' so a fix is just down the road a bit. ;-) 4Ui812 LOL Andrey Simakov They are Google because Google. David’s Flattop Reigns Supreme Well that was helpfull Glen Barrington Then they'll abandon the whole thing because Google.. ¯_(ツ)_/ John Marshall’s Ghost Why isn't this USB C? I have a Pixel XL and my wife has the Nexus 5X. We have switched our lives over to USB C. Why would I want to carry around another cable or an adapter just for a set of headphones? I have not been able to find a set of USB C wireless headphones and for the life of me, I can't understand why. vmxr ugly Cael That G looks like a Q to mean. Clearly the Nexus Q2 /s Thomas Larsen It's a power button Cael I was being sarcastic... Thomas Larsen I know, even without the /s makiller The manual showing an aux cable included reinforces for me that Google will keep the headphone jack on the next Pixel again. I doubt they'd include an aux cord with their new branded headphones if their new branded phone couldn't even use it..... right? These are kind of ugly though. ITGuy11 Right. Cause your going to need that headphone jack due to Pixel 2 Bluetooth issues ¯_(ツ)_/¯ JG Counter point... That assumes everyone at Google will be using the Pixel 2. I would imagine some (especially those developing for iOS) use iPhones. And several probably carry around Galaxy devices etc... You don't have to eat McDonalds for every meal just because you work there... You're also further assuming the aux cord is to be plugged into the phone. Maybe the aux port is included so the headphones can connect to the employee's computer terminal. Or maybe the equipment in the campus gym, like at my gym, lack bluetooth and need a wired connection in order to listen to the built in TV/music player. Or since Google will only need a small quantity I would imagine it would probably have been easier and cheaper just to use parts already in production rather than asking whoever is actually building them to create custom hardware for a relatively small order. That would also explain why the charge port is microUSB and not USB-C. DanSan just curious, is there a reason why you'd expect a microphone for these? I'm just guessing here but these don't look like gaming or professional use headphones which would be the only time they might require a mic. This looks more like trying to capture the hype of other products like beats. No idea but do beats have a built in mic? I get it, maybe it would be good for assistant if it had a mic but not sure i see lack of microphone a drawback, especially when similar headphones dont have them matteventu For... Calls? DanSan do other headphones that look or fit in this same category have the same functionality? i only ask because the article is written as if not having a mic is a knock against the product yet i dont think anything else in this space has a mic. Miku is Best Vocaloid Most of them do. matteventu Aurevoir 3.5mm jack on Pixel 2. Damnit. Fr0gg0 It's not like anyone outside Google would want to wear those. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Never underestimate the power of branding. sebastianer Yeah....for less than 150€ you can get some AKG K701s headphones.(that you can mod if you need more Low frequency). And for 100 USD you can get a Schiit Fulla 2 amazing DAC and reasonable good amp. That's all you need for a decent audio quality nowadays. Tom Harman Yes Please! Jeffrey Spiers I'll be scouring Ebay for these... icyhotmike Supported for 3 months and then left dry to die a slow and unfixed death -Every Google product KRS_Won Google Listen™ Built with Cast® I'd prob buy em. Rinkesh621 Those earmuff bezels tho ! Complimentary with Pixel 2? Alfonso Surroca It's a shame this headset is internal-only. A Google headset such as this would fit nicely with their consumer product mix, especially if it only worked in conjunction with all-new dedicated messaging and voice apps. G Suite Headset Messenger by Google has a nice ring to it. Rod Moore What is this AUX you speak of? All of Goggles phones have USB-C ports. Plus the Chromebooks are coming out with USB-C. Very odd to be using a older USB auxiliary port. hzd Bluetooth Google headphones . . . Haha expect less work to get done at Google from here on in, Google's relationship with any BT is always Rocky !

The $20bn data-analytics company, co-founded by Peter Thiel, one of the president’s advisers, has not admitted wrongdoing in the settlement, which comes at a time of increasing debate about discrimination in the tech industry. The payout, negotiated by the Trump administration’s Department of Labor (DoL), comes amid concern in Silicon Valley over the immigration and labor policies likely to be enacted by the White House. Trump’s chief strategist Steve Bannon has previously suggested he believes that there are too many Asian executives in Silicon Valley. Steve Hilton: 'I’m rich, but I understand the frustrations people have' Read more In the final year of Barack Obama’s administration, labor officials targeted the California tech sector with high-profile lawsuits alleging discriminatory employment practices at Palantir, Oracle and Google. While there have been concerns about the fate of these cases under Trump, given the president’s connections to key tech executives and his ongoing efforts to undo labor protections, the Palantir resolution suggests that the DoL is pushing forward with its Obama-era enforcement efforts. The agreement – which establishes a consent decree requiring Palantir to pay $1,659,434 in back wages and other monetary relief – comes weeks after the DoL accused Google of systematically underpaying women. An official with the department, which is seeking to force the internet search giant to hand over more internal data, told the Guardian: “The government’s analysis at this point indicates that discrimination against women in Google is quite extreme, even in this industry.” The labor department first filed the suit against Palantir in September, alleging that the Palo Alto-based company used a discriminatory hiring process in which Asian applicants “were routinely eliminated in the résumé screen and telephone interview phases despite being as qualified as white applicants”. Like Google and Oracle, Palantir is a federal contractor, which means it’s required to follow a higher standard of equal opportunity laws and provide the government data for audits. The DoL suit, which sought lost wages, said that from a pool of more than 1,160 qualified software engineer applicants, approximately 85% were Asian, but the company hired 14 non-Asian employees and only 11 Asian people. And even though a majority of qualified intern applicants were Asian, Palantir hired four times as many non-Asians than Asians, the suit said. The settlement agreement also forces Palantir to offer jobs to eight eligible people included in the class covered by the suit. “We disagree with the allegations made by the Department of Labor. We settled this matter, without any admission of liability, in order to focus on our work,” Palantir said in a statement. “We continue to stand by our employment record and are glad to have resolved this case.” Google accused of 'extreme' gender pay discrimination by US labor department Read more Thomas Dowd, acting director of the DoL’s office of federal contract compliance programs, said in a statement that the government had worked with Palantir to “resolve” the issues, adding: “Together, we will ensure that the company complies with equal employment opportunity laws in its recruitment, hiring and other employment practices.” If the case was not resolved, Palantir could have lost its government contracts. Palantir has been the subject of protests due to Thiel’s relationship with Trump and because of growing concerns about how federal agencies can use the firm’s software to assist in the president’s mass deportations agenda. The Palantir case is unique given that similar companies have faced accusations of bias in favor of Asian applicants. In the recent DoL suit against Oracle, the government said the tech corporation’s hiring and recruiting processes discriminated against non-Asian applicants. The settlement comes at a time when the Trump administration, as part of his anti-immigrant agenda, has also targeted a visa program that enables skilled foreign workers to secure employment in Silicon Valley. In addition to his suggestions that there are too many Asian CEOs, Bannon, the former Breitbart chairman with ties to white nationalism, has broadly complained about Asian engineers and foreign students taking jobs away from US-born citizens.

Google posts truly incredible night images captured by the Pixel and Nexus 6P Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/25 11:28am PDTApr 25, 2017 61 Plus 1 on G+ 452 Share on Facebook 107 Share on Twitter Total Shares620 Google News Nexus 6P Pixel Pixel XL Smartphone cameras have come a long way, but can you ever take images that rival a "real" camera? According to Google software engineer Florian Kainz, the answer is yes. Using a custom camera app and some post-capture editing , Kainz shows what the camera sensors in the Pixel and Nexus 6P can do in low light situations. Kainz says his little project was inspired by a chat with Google's Gcam team, which focuses on computational photography. The most visible Gcam contribution to Google's products is HDR+, which allows phones like the Pixel to take photos in dim lighting by combining as many as 10 burst shots. HDR+ isn't perfect, though. Sometimes there just isn't enough light to produce a good image. 64 4-second exposures, shot with Nexus 6P With long exposures and lots of individual images, Kainz reasoned it should be possible to get much better photos out of a smartphone's tiny camera sensor. To test this, he built a simple camera app with manual control over exposure time, ISO, and focus distance. The image at the top of the Point Reyes Lighthouse at night was Kainz's first test. This is a composite of 32 frames at 4-second exposure and ISO 1600, taken with the Nexus 6P. He also covered the lens and captured 32 completely black frames. The RAW image files were exported to Photoshop, where the mean of all 32 photos was computed, then the mean of the 32 black frames was subtracted. Below you can see what one of the individual HDR+ photos looked like. Impressive, no? A single 6P HDR+ frame Kainz did more tests with a variety of editing tricks, which you can read about in the full post. Below are some of the photos taken with the Pixel, but that phone only supports maximum 2-second exposures. Kainz speculates that a longer exposures could allow even better low-light photos on smartphones, assuming the subject is not moving and you have a tripod. Amusingly, the Pixel photos were taken in June and July last year, long before the phone was announced. 64 2-second exposures, shot with Google Pixel Many of the editing tweaks used to produce these images could be automated, too. You could imagine an app for Android or a mode in the camera that does most of this for you. Of course, the processing time for a few dozen RAW files would be rather lengthy on a phone. Maybe it could be built into Google Photos? If you want to see more photos from Kainz's experiments, there's a Google Photos album. 64 2-second exposures, shot with Pixel Source: Google Research Tags camera Google google research hdr nexus 6p photography pixel research subscribe ...

Random! Also, fucking skills of whoever is doing all the post processing in these pics. This ain't special about the Pixel and 6P after all, this post processing algorithm could be applied to any phone's pics. madcanada Any pics. Including a DSLR and night sky shots. Gonna try this weekend. shutUface 6p hdr post processing is really good. Throw the photos in snapseed for a little effect. Ocepi https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/63d92d20e4febf4677fb9a1dbbdd2230d3563bf5f95c0c065225af6ddf0baf25.jpg Milton P. This, I need this in my life!!! I'm dying for long exposure option in my phone. ChronoReverse The Htc 10 hardware can do stuff like this already. Here's a 900 second exposure: https://www.flickr.com/photos/maik_reifschneider/29419144492/ HebeGuess same sensors IMX377 as 5X/6P, different optics (with OIS). Pink tint at lower right corner was IR bleed from Laser Autofocus. James Doyle 64 pictures was all they could take before the 6P immediately shut down, probably while the battery read 35%. Snark aside, at this point I think maybe it's too soon to automate something like this on the phone itself, but this would be an amazing thing that Google Photos's AI could automate for us. David Ruddock Exactly. If you could use a stabilizer/tripod and upload the photos to the cloud. That would be nuts. James Doyle I'm almost there for just HDR+. A half dozen HDR+ images all trying to process brings my phone to a crawl, meaning I can't take any more pictures. Let's calm down the processing until I've stopped taking pics, or offload the work to the cloud. jonzey231 Yep. Totally agree with this statement. Once you've got a pretty dark photo trying to process or two decent images trying to process at once, the phone is basically a brick for the next 30 seconds. TSS TS 'The Cloud' doesn't work that way - Cloud based technologies fall under xaaS (IaaS/SaaS/DaaS) - The most common application is DaaS - Which is the only cloud space Google offers to residential consumers. Even if Google created an IaaS product scope, the limitations of current cell protocols would never allow 'processing' to be handed off to anything. Process threads are computed locally. There is nobody on this planet that has figured out how to parse thread computation over ANY WAN/LAN/Network to a central CPU farm to work out xyz process. The concept would be incredibly inefficient anyways. As the CPU processing the threads would have to process the inbound transaction, process the job, then redistribute back to the client. It would being doing 3-10x the work to say nothing have the transaction congestion, and security issues. Reference : Me, i'm a Sys Engineer/Admin. Toodles. Stuart Anderson His point is they could delay and/or limit the HDR+ work until after he's done taking pictures. And post processing like this doesn't need to be real time anyway. Jake Ashton lol. TSS TS got owned! leave it to the "experts" to think inside the box and just tell people what they can't do. toodles Jason Edwards lol EH101 I think you're misunderstanding. What he means is take the 64 pictures (or 3 for regular HDR), let them all get uploaded as you normally would when you hit wifi, then let Google Photos online do the work to make the final picture. Not let the 'cloud' process something that stays on the device in real time. Google already does this to an extent, letting Google Photos 'read' the images and group them by face etc. Sean Buckman I'm using google pixel and I just keep shooting with no lag. It takes a bit(around 5-10 seconds) after taking the pictures to process the HDR+ but it doesn't slow the phone down. Matt I wonder how long it would take to upload 64 RAW files to the cloud... whispy_snippet With Australia's internet speeds I estimate 231 years and six days. Winston What are you talking about? I was there last year and loved the speeds I could get on LTE. But then again I was on Telstra... whispy_snippet I'm on Telstra too but I wasn't referring to cellular data speeds.

I wouldn't mind the wait if the phone could just do it fo me though. 7-down And yet, Google Camera app will be dry as bones with basic features. JohnyNoLegs It's like Google don't care about features. Like they think people will be happy with the most basic of applications. 2kool4skool ✓ⱽᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵇʸ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Google dumbed-down their apps to be as simple and as barebone as possible because apparently there are people that are scared with having options. These are the same people that call any phone or app that offers more than basic features as "gimmicks". JohnyNoLegs Completely agree. For some reason, there has always been a market for this. Feels to me it's for people who either don't do that much on their phone, or like buying third party apps for some reason. Tom Harman While I like my pixel, I'll stick to my D800e for 99% of my photos. madcanada Lol, I have a Canon 6D and I stick to Nexus 6P for 99% of my photos :D Patrick Comparing a 6D and a D800e is like comparing a Polaroid to a Leica. They're different tools for much different uses. That being said, I'm surprised that the Pixel wouldn't take over for the d800e... The simplicity, man! I don't shoot my d800 for anything but photo shoots now because the Pixel is too easy to get great shots and I don't have to spend hours in post. catalysto In the context of comparing to a smartphone, they are practically the same. Trent It's impressive, of course. But to suggest that even the best software will help a Pixel rival a DSLR is comedic. Good enough for most, they are, but put them up on a big screen next to similar shots from even a Nikon D3300 and the lack of pixels (amongst other things) will show which is better. There's also the small matter of all that editing hassle. Naturally, I shoot RAW with my DSLR, but a little time in Lightroom is generally all that's needed to make a shot pop. I appreciate that I'm being a little over-the-top in my condemnation, image quality/rivaling "real" cameras is about more than just how good something looks on a smartphone display. It's about being able to zoom in without a major loss of quality and casting the image to a TV and it not looking bad at that size. I do like my Pixel very much and it's great for casual shots. A DSLR replacement it is not, however. David Ruddock I think this is mostly about the power of light-gathering and composite HDR even when in use even with a tiny sensor. It bodes well for the future of algorithmic photography if nothing else - as sensors get better and algorithms do, too, we can keep pushing the limits of these already impressive methods. This example just takes it to an extreme as a showcase. madcanada This article is about the algorithm. You can apply the same process to a DSLR image making night sky shots even better. OhYeah! This is basicly only due to the Photo stacking technique. You can tell from the single image that each photo is pretty terrible but once you median stack the photos it can average out all the noise. You could create a photo that looked pretty great from a Galaxy S 3 if you really wanted to. madcanada Yes, that's what I said. OhYeah! Yep you kind of did in a different way. Good job, you can recognize similarities! TechGuy22 yet no one can buy the pixel thank god i was able to sell my 6p for 500 bucks and bought the xl rjyanj "no one can buy the pixel" "i bought the xl" hmm. TechGuy22 https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel_phone?hl=en-US can you buy it there ? that's what i meant dumb ass. i have an XL too. didn't buy it from google. nxtiak XL: Black 32gb and 128gb ships May 4th. Silver 32gb, available now, 128gb 3-4weeks. So Yes? Non XL are all out of stock. Shawn Spring I did the same, dumped the 6P after I had preordered the Pixel XL on launch day. Boy am I glad I did. Stevie_Wonder Shooting RAW (DNG) and manual exposure. Google just told us what we are missing from the Google Camera app. Thank you Google, but we knew that already. Bala dunno whats stopping google from adding shutter speed and raw format to the google camera. hate them for it JD Saving it for the Pixel 2 *Obviously* Mihai Ionescu What Manual camera app do you reccomend?

Scott Olsen There's plenty of them already. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.flavionet.android.camera.pro Mike Or just get any phone that isn't developed by Google. My name is…. the smart choice martesque Like say, the LG V20 camera app. Defenestratus Took this picture on my old Nexus 6P of my neighbor's house the other day while walking the pooch. Moon was right behind the light house. the picture is pretty grainy but still pretty impressive given how dark it was outside (even though it doesn't look like it in the picture, I think Google Photos messed with the settings a bit) https://goo.gl/photos/1VBuUKxRGC7Dutyh7 Rod URL not found Ahamid17 Its a shame I had to give up my 5X for an iPhone because of that boot loop issue other than that I really loved my 5X camera Ahamid17 I would love to see the process in which he combined that 64 and 32 frames to get that result and imagine in the future if your camera app could do that in app instead of doing it on photoshop Tauran This needs to be an automated processing trick on Google photos. HDR is great but people like me don't have time to process photos manually to look this great. WittyPixel Salty post... "This is a composite of 32 frames at 4-second exposure and ISO 1600, taken with the Nexus 6P" realizing google didn't unlock all the capabilities he builds an apps to do so. If google allowed apps to use the sensor to it's full capability then we could do the same and the camera would be truly amazing. Gjorgi Lazarovski I don't get what you're saying but the Camera2 API that's in Android since Lollipop allows this and is fully enabled on both phones. You just need the right app, like Manual Camera from the Play store for example. With a tripod and set of skills in Photoshop you're most likely to get the same results by yourself. Kyle Gospodnetich The Pixel and 6P camera drivers are limited to 2 second exposures max. There are many other phones from other manufacturers that can have much, much longer exposure times set via the Camera2 API. funky There is also a hack on xda to support longer exposures, I guess 4 sec WittyPixel future reference... link or it doesn't exist. and there is not one for the nexus 6p, fyi. funky https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=71165047&postcount=88 WittyPixel wow, being a 6P owner and semi xda nut surprised I missed that. thanks! WittyPixel camera 2 API does not allow that feature. bobinchicago Hey, my Nexus 6P would take great shots too if the battery life wasn't down to an hour and plunging down to 0 the moment I open the camera app. VAVAMk_2 Get a replacement battery dblock I honestly think even the 6P has a better camera than the S8+. I have only had the phone less than a week, but thus far it seems like the camera just isn't as good, back or front camera for that matter. And it may not be the sensors themselves, but perhaps the software. The Google Camera on the Nexus/Pixel devices is just too damn good. JohnyNoLegs Blind tests put the S8 on almost equal footing of the Pixel. It's all in the software. Hence why it takes so long to process images after you take them. Klugschwaetzer Mhh. I'm wondering why I see no star trails after 2 minutes. Stars should not be round, but elongated. Since they are quite round, it seems that this Mr. Kainz has adjusted for earth's motion somehow. But then the branches of the trees should be blurry. Very strange indeed. ChicagoPete I hope you've taken the last 12 minutes to read the source post for this article. Klugschwaetzer I have. Have you? 64 images with two second exposure each means that not counting an intervall between shots you look at the sky for over 128 seconds. The stars will have moved by that time making a virtual overexposure very difficult. Unless he somehow compensated for that. But I don't see how he could have done that - as I said before. Klugschwaetzer Just read the source article. Thanks for pointing that out. jwildman16 Two seconds, not minutes. NinoBr0wn I've given up hope for Google to update their camera app to something above a passing grade. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good strategy by Google to do night pictures. That minimizes the chance of getting halos in the Pixel pictures. whispy_snippet Haven't you already been completely burnt in a camera debate that forced you to leave the discussion without a reply? Why would you want to do it again? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Blocking the Google fanboy. dabug91 because he totally REKT you? LOL Do the world a favor, and refrain from every using the internet again? Billy Bob Jimmy Joe It's funny when the troll blocks you. whispy_snippet Yep, can't win so you quit. Covering yourself in glory once again. Billy Bob Jimmy Joe You are an annoying troll. You probably just don't know it yet. You go to every Google article to bash the Pixel. I also see you bashing the Pixel in an article about a Samsung issue. You, sir, are pathetic. Mix I was like how in the heck can I do this with my Pixel!? ".....he built a simple camera app with manual control over exposure time" Dammit. New_Guy ....aaaa https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/24e29b3703f641799852ae78976add647c419d1f551c6dbd44d370d7d1efcc18.png nd it's now my wallpaper =) inthemidleofnowere What they need is to integrate exposure times, iso, and other of those 2 year old photography tools that have been present in Samsung and LG. Casper Pascal What?!?! How did he make the Nexus 6P do a 4-second long exposure shot? Nexus firmware just allows me to reach 1/5-second exposure time :( yubnub Umm no offense, but these look like crappy DSLR shots. Naxx ENVY I've taken some offence actually. Jason Edwards This is fantastic. I keep trying to tell all of the "photographers" that tell me physics gets in the way of a phone taking a good picture that they are discounting how much software will play in the future of photography. This proves I am right. dabug91 Umm, no, it doesn't prove you're right. Even 10 years from now, cameras with larger sensors will still be producing better images with richer detail than those with tiny sensors. Larger photosites DO make a difference that software simply can't account for. How do we know this? Because a 9-year-old 12-megapixel D700 full-frame DSLR and 28mm f/1.8 or f/2.8 lens still creates better images using software from nearly 9 years ago than what a modern-day flagship smartphone camera does with today's software. Cute ego about being "proven right", tho. Shai Nice long exposure shot of Tel Aviv's beaches I took with the LG G6: https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ed85a80053a2a1b8cbdb82d08e8410f7a33360c8fe6286d26df784785b86cfc7.jpg Biga173rd Exactly dabug91 Exactly really blurry. Biga173rd lol Biga173rd If I were in these locations my shots would look like those too. RainMotorsports It's kind of bad my Nexus 6P is better than my old dSLR in most situations that don't require off camera lighting or telephoto lenses. I need a new camera lol.

[Update: Just headphones for employees] Google-branded wireless headphones show up at the FCC Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/26 10:28am PDTApr 26, 2017 82 Plus 1 on G+ 136 Share on Facebook 111 Share on Twitter Total Shares329 Google News Update 1: 2017/04/26 10:30am PDT An anonymous tipster has shed some light on what these almost certainly are. Google issues headphones to a large number of its employees, and the current model is getting quite Well this is... unexpected. We've heard whispers of a new Google Home/Google WiFi combo, and even the next Pixel devices, but nothing in the realm of audio products. Out of nowhere, a set of headphones from Google have appeared in a new FCC filing. The headphones, which are identified as 'GID5B,' are definitely a bit odd. One side has a power button, and the other a simple Google logo, both in a circle matching Google's logo colors. According to the documents, these headphones support Bluetooth connectivity - but there doesn't appear to be any mention of a microphone. As with many wireless headphones, there is an AUX connector if you don't want to mess with Bluetooth. Strangely, there is a microUSB port for charging - not USB Type-C. According to the user manual included in the FCC filing, GID5B has a 600mAh battery. It's very possible that this was filed to get clearance on the internal radio, which could later be included on a different pair of headphones. The microUSB port, lack of microphone functionality, and no Google Assistant features seems to back up this claim. It would be a bit strange for Google to release headphones without any unique functionality, using an old port. Update 1: 2017/04/26 10:30am PDT An anonymous tipster has shed some light on what these almost certainly are. Google issues headphones to a large number of its employees, and the current model is getting quite long in the tooth. We've got a picture of it below. As you can see, it bears the same power button iconography as the ones in the FCC filing above. These headphones are distributed for use only inside Google and are not sold anywhere - they're just for Googlers. This new ANC Bluetooth version is just an update on the design, probably meant to replace these older headsets as they're phased out. So, no: Google is not releasing a really ugly wireless headphone with a microUSB port and no microphone. Well, not to anyone except Googlers.

Not Google's... #facepalm FRGuzman That's actually Google's official merchandise store. Admittedly, it does look fake. It's run by a third party company that has the license to produce merchandise with G's logo, though. MJ How do we know this? Source? Why would Google use like a 3rd rate company for this? Anyone have a link from Google's website to that site? Gobelet The SSL certificate was delivered by Google themselves. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2ec49ef6e0020e3a0c8436a7f6610146bd0e573f443b2d220fc2a5baf5ed48be.png MJ Well played sir... Best proof after a half dozen comments. Again, why have a third rate looking store site that looks like crap/fake? FRGuzman I did some research on it a couple of months ago as I was looking for a Google decal and stumbled upon this website and it looked kinda shady to me too. I can't recall all the evidence I gathered but I ended up convinced it was legit. I'd say Google doesn't care too much about branded merchandising and they off loaded it to a third party company that in my opinion doesn't even offer compeling or quality looking goods. Shagnscooby Weird. I knew they had a merch store but I certainly didn't think there was electronics there that weren't on the store.google.com They must not make or design the merch ones and it's just a logo slapped on. MJ They don't... It's a fake store. Shagnscooby It's not fake. I've done telephone survey's for Google and one of the payment options was a Google Merch store gift card instead of other gift cards. MJ Google does telephone surveys? Who even answers telephone surveys or picks up on unrecognized numbers? mog386 Wrong. It's legit. Lol. You dolt. "About Robertson Marketing Robertson is Google’s branded merchandise partner in North America.

MJ Really? You had go with the name calling? I don't care what the fucking website says... It doesn't look legit at all. Even if they have the rights to slap the Google logo on shit they aren't Google's products. The OP was wrong about the headphones. Aaron Berlin I'm guessing those are just white label goods with Google branding on them, so GOOG wouldn't actually file with the FCC. Maybe??? MJ It's not official merchandise! It's fake! mog386 Wrong. It's legit. Lol. "About Robertson Marketing Robertson is Google’s branded merchandise partner in North America.

David Ruddock I'm sorry, but not even close. MJ LOL I beat you to it David. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I mean they are both headphones... Dan Proctor Mentioned it above but my comment was aimed at these going into their merchandise store vs a real consumer product. My company offers the same generic branded things that go through the FCC as our own products. Very common among the bigger companies of the world. David Ruddock They could, but seeing as we've never seen any headphones go through under Google's name before, I have my doubts. Dan Proctor As in these look like they will be going into this store. Same as other people have said about them being the generic items Google offers at events and to employees. David Mendívil if this thing has an internal FM radio receiver (analog), I will get one Sashank Narayan What mainstream headphones even have that capability? Justin W I can answer this: none. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And why? FM radio still exists? David Mendívil dude, not everyone lives in EEUU or EUROPE, most of the human population still hears analogical radio stations Matt It's not just a Europe thing. I live in the US and I have not listened to FM radio in years. Erstam Same. I despise analog radio. Do many commercials plus it usually sounds like crap. DanSan I don't even know where the FM radio button is in my car. /s yes i do but you get the point. David Mendívil Sorry EEUU is USA in Spanish hehe but at least in south america, it is quite common to still have the good old FM radio stations, having a data plan is still too expensive Matt Oh, right. I even know that. I think having it right next to EUROPE my brain just combined it all. podme Probably giveaways to employees and swag for events, etc Jarrett Lennon Kaufman They'd be better off rebranding OEM headphones for just that, though, and could skip this process. Mordalo I'm more concerned about the sound quality. If they sound good and don't break my bank account (or my mortgage payment), I'd be happy to get another set of good Bluetooth cans. They don't need to be always on or listening (even though this is Google). mlm5em Sees Headline: Must buy immediately Sees Mirco USB: Run away T4rd What wireless headphones (or any phone/PC accessories) have USB-C ports yet? Erstam My phone is usb c. My Chromebook only had usb c. I have a mouse and keyboard that are usb c. My battery pack is usb c. Come to the future brother. It's great!. I use the same cable to charge everything normally too. I actually had the same thought as the guy above. I'm not buying anything that's not usb c any more. It's not future proof and i rarely have to carry a non c cable anymore (except on a trip i bring an extra micro usb for my gf s7). T4rd So your mouse and keyboard.. that's pretty much it. I agree, I would only like to buy USB C accessories as well, but it seems they're not picking it up any time soon still. catalysto So you're being purposefully obtuse. T4rd Likewise. catalysto That's a yes. T4rd For you. DanSan https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5e55bc06067cf74753d28062e8aaf21244bf97f17ad555a1d4b58976f73be2bf.gif catalysto Interesting angle you took there. T4rd You trying to be (a)cute? =p Charles https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/04c3103885fe90c9fac6a716024d3ffabaa2c2d1637efd9143fe07e90fbe15f3.jpg matteventu Which USB-C mouse have you got? I was looking for one to replace my MAX Anywhere 2. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Lol. This is ridiculously ugly T4rd Headphones with Cast built in..? Could be cool. marcusmarcus2 That is the first thing I thought when I read the headline makapav That would be a pretty good idea - as long as it also has a mic for calls and gives the option for filtering in ambient sound/noise when needed. Rinkesh621 How about cast and miniature Google home, so you can order pizza, while you stream your music from your Spotify while you watch e-sport games with Picture in Picture of watching old Charlie Chaplin silent film? No.... just a though. lol SpeakethTheTruth Sounds like a Pimp My Ride episode. Lateef Alabi-Oki 600mAh battery for a headphone? What are they aiming for? A week long battery life. Jay I'd probably buy them because Google. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ 4Ui812 They'll probably have issues out of the box because .... Google ¯_(ツ)_/ Mohamed Fixaal And they'll later release 10 new headphones and change their names later in because Google.. ¯_(ツ)_/ David’s Flattop Reigns Supreme Wow, Its a trifecta of wisdom!! Diego Opazo SV-Cross ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ After that they'll release a companion app ecosystem only to abandon them altogether because ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Ray And then one model will shut down randomly with 35% battery still remaining. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ David’s Flattop Reigns Supreme even more helpful.... Nexus✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Guess I've gotten mostly lucky, my two galaxy nexus, nexus 4, 5, 7, google home, chromecasts, nexus player, and pixel didn't have problems out of the box. my 5x developed crazy slowness over time rendering it barely useful (and I've flashed all sorts of roms and formatted storage and disabled encryption). Nigel Antonio im right there with you, but ad a nexus 1. and a Pixel to the mix. Dennis Lockhart Maybe but they'll be in 'beta' so a fix is just down the road a bit. ;-) 4Ui812 LOL Andrey Simakov They are Google because Google. David’s Flattop Reigns Supreme Well that was helpfull Glen Barrington Then they'll abandon the whole thing because Google.. ¯_(ツ)_/ John Marshall’s Ghost Why isn't this USB C? I have a Pixel XL and my wife has the Nexus 5X. We have switched our lives over to USB C. Why would I want to carry around another cable or an adapter just for a set of headphones? I have not been able to find a set of USB C wireless headphones and for the life of me, I can't understand why. vmxr ugly Cael That G looks like a Q to mean. Clearly the Nexus Q2 /s Thomas Larsen It's a power button Cael I was being sarcastic... Thomas Larsen I know, even without the /s makiller The manual showing an aux cable included reinforces for me that Google will keep the headphone jack on the next Pixel again. I doubt they'd include an aux cord with their new branded headphones if their new branded phone couldn't even use it..... right? These are kind of ugly though. ITGuy11 Right. Cause your going to need that headphone jack due to Pixel 2 Bluetooth issues ¯_(ツ)_/¯ JG Counter point... That assumes everyone at Google will be using the Pixel 2. I would imagine some (especially those developing for iOS) use iPhones. And several probably carry around Galaxy devices etc... You don't have to eat McDonalds for every meal just because you work there... You're also further assuming the aux cord is to be plugged into the phone. Maybe the aux port is included so the headphones can connect to the employee's computer terminal. Or maybe the equipment in the campus gym, like at my gym, lack bluetooth and need a wired connection in order to listen to the built in TV/music player. Or since Google will only need a small quantity I would imagine it would probably have been easier and cheaper just to use parts already in production rather than asking whoever is actually building them to create custom hardware for a relatively small order. That would also explain why the charge port is microUSB and not USB-C. DanSan just curious, is there a reason why you'd expect a microphone for these? I'm just guessing here but these don't look like gaming or professional use headphones which would be the only time they might require a mic. This looks more like trying to capture the hype of other products like beats. No idea but do beats have a built in mic? I get it, maybe it would be good for assistant if it had a mic but not sure i see lack of microphone a drawback, especially when similar headphones dont have them matteventu For... Calls? DanSan do other headphones that look or fit in this same category have the same functionality? i only ask because the article is written as if not having a mic is a knock against the product yet i dont think anything else in this space has a mic.

Roston - Apr 26, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Modern cooking typically involves putting a tablet in the kitchen and fumbling through the directions while trying to keep the screen clean. Google is changing that. The company has announced that it is bringing step-by-step cooking instructions to Google Home via Google Assistant, giving its users access to more than 5 million of these spoken recipes. With them, cooking is as simple as listening to the Home device. Living with Google Home Google says the recipe cooking instructions are available courtesy of multiple publications, including Food Network, the magazine Bon Appetit, and others. Users will use their iOS or Android device to locate a recipe via Google Search or Google Assistant. Once a recipe is selected, the user then taps ‘Send to Google Home.’ The recipe is then shuttled to the IoT device. The cooking instructions don’t start until the user is ready, however; they need to say: ‘OK Google, start cooking/recipe.’ Google Assistant will first cover the ingredients required by the recipe, then will proceed to the cooking instructions on a step-by-step basis. Users can ask for a specific step’s instructions or ask the Assistant to repeat the most recent instructions when necessary. Google Home will support other questions and actions while a recipe is active. For example, users can ask for conversions like grams to ounces or tablespoons to cups without losing the cooking instructions. Google Home can also play music or set a timer while cooking instructions are underway. The video above demonstrates all of this in action. Not familiar with Google Home? The Internet giant’s somewhat new IoT device is similar to Amazon Echo and gives users voice-access to searches, other IoT devices and more. While Amazon Echo utilizes Alexa, Google Home uses the new Google Assistant, a personal assistant akin to Alexa and Siri. Google Home is available through multiple retailers, including the online Google Store for $129 USD.

It sounds exciting, doesn’t it? Google putting their stamp on a pair of quality Bluetooth headphones, and they probably work great with all Android phones whereas most average Bluetooth headphones have a few quirks to deal with! But, sadly, that’s not what’s going on here. It seems these headphones are an updated version of the headsets Google has on offer for their employees. The old cans were still using a wire, so Google decided it was high time they stepped into the 21st century and cut the cord. As such, you likely won’t ever be able to buy these Google-branded headphones, but now is a good time to start telling Google how cool it would be for them to announce something like them (with a prettier frame and USB-C in tow, we’d hope) to go alongside those new Pixel devices we know are coming later this year.

Get ready for your closeup, #Saturn. https://t.co/TSA7uPWtTk pic.twitter.com/ifQVIZ478Y — CassiniSaturn (@CassiniSaturn) April 26, 2017 Today, Google is honoring NASA's Cassini mission to Saturn with an adorable Google Doodle featuring the spacecraft swooping between the planet and its rings. Cassini kicked off its "Grand Finale" at Saturn this morning (April 26) with the first of 22 planned ring dives that the spacecraft will execute before fatally crashing into Saturn on Sept. 15. The animated Google Doodle shows a cute Cassini cartoon snapping photos of a smiling Saturn while diving through the planet's iconic rings. NASA expects to receive the first close-up shots from today's flyby tomorrow (April 27), but the best images are yet to come. [Cassini's 'Grand Finale' at Saturn: NASA's Plan in Pictures] As Cassini's orbit gradually nears Saturn over the next few months, these close-ups will keep getting closer. The spacecraft will continue to beam back unprecedented views of Saturn even as it plunges into the planet's atmosphere before ending its mission in a fatal crash. (The death dive was designed to ensure that Earth microbes on Cassini do not contaminate Saturn moons Enceladus and Titan, which have the potential to host life.) "By plunging into this fascinating frontier, Cassini will help scientists learn more about the origins, mass, and age of Saturn's rings, as well as the mysteries of the gas giant's interior," Google wrote in a statement. "Who knows what marvels this hardy explorer will uncover in the final chapter of its mission?" Email Hanneke Weitering at hweitering@space.com or follow her @hannekescience.

REUTERS/Bryan Woolston    Google Gives Employees Permission To Walk Out On Their Jobs For Trump Protest Eric Lieberman Tech and Law Reporter 2:36 PM 04/26/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP 5617271 Google is allowing workers to take off from work May 1 to protest President Donald Trump, whether or not they give advance notice. Pro-immigration groups, socialist organizations, labor unions, and hundreds of thousands of workers are planning to walk out on their jobs on International Workers Day to voice their displeasure with the Trump administration, reports Buzzfeed. “We respect everyone’s choice to act on their beliefs,” a Google spokesperson told BuzzFeed News. “We care deeply about creating an environment at Google where everyone — employees and contractors, engineers, cafeteria workers and janitorial staff — feels comfortable doing so. We’re asking managers to be flexible in accommodating time-off requests and have let our vendor partners know that we support them doing the same.” Google also encouraged business associates to give their workers the opportunity to take the day off without any retribution. “The move comes after over 40 labor, immigrant rights and community organizations issued a letter to Google, calling on them to make a public commitment to ensure that subcontracted employees working in Google offices would be protected if they chose to participate in May 1 demonstrations or rallies,” Meghan Cohorst, a spokesperson for UNITE HERE, a labor union representing around 270,000 people, told The Daily Caller News Foundation. It is not very surprising that Google is permitting their workers to walk out on their jobs to demonstrate against Trump. The former CEO of Google, Eric Schmidt, who now serves as the executive chairman of parent company Alphabet, told an audience of employees in January that the Trump administration is “going to do these evil things as they’ve done in the immigration area and perhaps some others.” Schmidt is also not shy about his affinity for liberal causes and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The tech executive was spotted wearing a “staff” badge during Clinton’s election night party. Alphabet was also reportedly spearheading the funding efforts for the legal brief signed by nearly 100 companies that objected to President Donald Trump’s temporary immigration ban. Google isn’t the only company to implement such a loose policy. Facebook also reportedly told its employees earlier in the month that they would go unpunished for not coming to work on that day of protest. Like Google, workers for the social media company don’t have to notify their superiors in advance. Follow Eric on Twitter Send tips to [email protected] .

The agreement between Alphabet, Google’s parent company, and ETECSA was signed in Havana in December. “This will only improve Cuban users experience with Google webpages, with the most notable improvement being in loading YouTube videos,” Madory explained. “Video is very traffic intensive and caching popular videos locally will improve load time and relieve strain on ETECSA’s congested international links.” facebook twitter email Share More Videos 1:26 "Chimp mom" raises two small chimpanzees in her Havana apartment Pause 4:19 Alan Gross says Cuba needs to join the 21st century 1:47 Don Mattingly talks about Wednesday's 7-4 loss to the Phillies 1:34 Greg Cote previews the Miami Dolphins' upcoming draft pick 1:07 Previewing who the Dolphins might pick in the 2017 NFL Draft 0:52 Giralda Al Fresco continues in Coral Gables 1:38 Woman killed on running track at Highlands High School 0:52 King Tide takes park visitors by surprise 1:30 Video captures man stuffing pillow case filled with puppies into drain (Graphic Content) 8:33 Marlins president David Samson talks about potential sale of the team Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email The summer of WiFi in Cuba This past summer the Cuban government rolled out 35 new WiFi hotspots around the country making access to the internet more convenient and more affordable than ever before for the Cuban people. People gather at the hotspots at all times of the day and evening to connect with friends and loved ones all over the world. Emily Michot Miami Herald staff After former President Barack Obama started a process of normalization with Cuba, Google has made several attempts to improve internet access on the island, which has one of the slowest connections on the planet, despite the existence of submarine cable ALBA-1. Internet penetration is also one of the lowest in Latin America and ETECSA is one of the companies most criticized by Cubans.

A mess on the floor I can deal with. A mess on my iPhone? Not so much. Today, Google is equipping its Google Assistant-powered speaker, Google Home, with over five million recipes from the likes of The New York Times, Food Network, and Bon Appetit. You’ll still be able to play music in the background or interrupt the speaker with other questions while in the middle of a recipe. Advertisement To start, open Google Search on your iPhone — or, if you have an Android phone, go to your Google Assistant to pick a recipe. After you’ve found one you like, click “Send to Google Home.” Then, tell the speaker, “Okay Google, start cooking.” Google Home will then tell you instructions one step at a time. If you need to backtrack or are a bit behind after chopping your onions, just say “Okay Google, repeat.” While Google Home beat Amazon Echo to the punch last week with its launch of multi-user voice recognition, Alexa was still the first one in the kitchen. In November, Amazon’s smart, voice-activated speaker made 60,000 Allrecipes meals available to cooks. Nevertheless, these recipes are a welcome addition to Google Home — and, with millions of options, it's an impressively expansive start. Plus, the announcement comes with a delicious-looking guide to making raspberry cheesecake jars. You had me at cheesecake, Google.

 Google's newest tool could save you tons of time and money shopping online Lucy Yang, INSIDER Apr. 26, 2017, 1:48 PM 133 facebook linkedin twitter email print Is this the future of online shopping? Topshop/Google The INSIDER Summary: Google Images's new tool, "Style Ideas," shows you how to wear products in your everyday life. Users can search for an item, select a photo, and scroll down to see how people are wearing the garment for their own style inspiration. You can also save money by comparing prices of alternative styles under "Similar Items."   I wouldn't say I'm addicted, but I'm definitely not a casual online shopper. Thanks to years of buying clothes in the wrong sizes from dozens of different brands, I can now tell — with approximately 95% accuracy — whether a dress, top, or a pair of jeans will fit me, just by looking at it online. Simply put, I know what looks good on me, and what really, really doesn't. (Off-the-shoulder tops. Light wash denim. Anything strapless.) Obviously, online shopping has its own set of shortcomings, especially when it comes to fashion. My biggest issue? Wasting money on things I never wear because I'm not sure how to style them. Enter Google's new mobile online shopping tool. It's like having a personal stylist — but on your phone and for free. Google When Google first rolled out "Style Ideas" two weeks ago, I was underwhelmed. To be honest, it just seemed like a less cool version of Pinterest's visual search tool, which was launched in 2016. But, unlike Pinterest, I use Google every day, and I was curious to see if the new feature would deliver on its promises. So far, I'm a fan.  The tool is a cross between Pinterest and Instagram, but way more straightforward and convenient. As Google explains in this blog post, "Style Ideas" is a gallery of "inspirational lifestyle images and outfits that showcase" how to wear products in your everyday life. Here's how to use it: 1. Search for a specific product or item of clothing on Google Images. Tap on the item you want, or already have. Google 2. After you select an image, scroll down on the screen until you see "Style Ideas." Click the "X" in the top left corner to choose another picture. Google  3. See how other people are wearing the item, and use their style ideas as inspiration for your own.Don't waste money on items you can't wear in real life.Google  4. You can also scroll through "Similar Items" to compare prices and browse through bargain options. A much easier way to find affordable alternatives. Google "Style Ideas," TechCrunch explains, uses machine vision to analyze pictures on Google and pick out similar products. But you should know that the feature won't show up for every product you look at on Google Images — not yet, at least. It all depends on how quickly retailers' web developers can add the data necessary for the tool to work. Currently, the feature is limited to mobile web and Android's Google app. I'm excited, however, to experiment more with the tool and finally stop buying items that'll just sit in my closet and collect dust.

Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Comment Some HTML is OK Sign me up for the Money Morning newsletter Name * Email * Website  −  one  =  three Alphabet Inc. (Nasdaq: GOOGL) could be looking at a potential split in the near future, thanks to overzealous government regulators and Uncle Sam's incessant desire to meddle with the private sector. Google is no stranger to these types of threats… In 2017, EC regulators in Europe voted to "break up" the Internet behemoth, splitting its search engine from its other commercial services. The EC said Google had "systematically" favored its own comparison shopping product in its search results, and that led Google to have an "unfair advantage" in breach of EU antitrust rules. Now, Google may be facing a similar sanction in the United States – an event Money Morning Chief Investment Strategist Keith Fitz-Gerald predicted back in 2014. "If the EU ever decides to break up Google, American regulators won't want to be upstaged," Keith said. "I think American regulators will ultimately follow along." We reached out to Keith for an update now that events are unfolding as he anticipated. Keith pointed out that government interference would be a worst-case scenario for a company like Google — and the American public. Google currently holds over 88% of market share in search advertising. "There's no doubt that Google needs to be broken up. But it needs to be broken up by the free hand of capitalism, not by the government," Keith said today (April 26). A seasoned market analyst with over 35 years of experience, he's seen firsthand what kind of effect regulation could have on business and he is, not surprisingly, a fierce free market advocate… Nothing Is More Dangerous for Google Than the U.S. Government "Every time the government gets involved, they screw it up," said Keith. For example, the U.S. government broke up the Bell Telephone Co. in 1983 by way of a U.S. Justice Department mandate and the Sherman Antitrust Act. The idea was to encourage competition by requiring the company to divest itself of the Bell Operating Cos. (which provided local telephone service across the United States and Canada). The thinking was classic big government. "Instead of trying to help existing and new companies develop, the government wants to compete by punishing the successful. They did it with railroads, with oil, with airlines — and now they're going to do it with technology (and, if this gathers steam, with Alphabet specifically)."The Justice Department mandate ensured that AT&T would be responsible for long-distance services while the newly independent "Baby Bells" would provide local phone services. Equipment formerly supplied on an exclusive basis, meanwhile, would no longer come from Western Electric, an AT&T subsidiary. "This was a huge telecom company with lots of power, and the government determined it would be better to break it up. So they did," said Keith. "And as a result, prices went up – which hurt the consumer. Service went down – which hurt the consumer. Shareholders lost everything – which also ultimately hurt the consumer. There's a theme here." Meanwhile, the so-called "Baby Bells" are back together today. Only you know them as Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ), CenturyLink Inc. (NYSE: CTL), and AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T). This time around, they control wireless, landlines, fiber optics, and data. "So much for limiting control — but try explaining that to a government official who's never worked in the private sector, who doesn't understand how to create shareholder value, and who has never had to cut a paycheck," noted Keith. Uncle Sam Loves to Tell a Great Story The New York Times proposed an interesting theory this past weekend. On April 22, it published a piece titled "Is It Time to Break Up Google?" that expounded upon how the government could regulate natural monopolies like Google just like it regulates public utilities. According to Keith, that would be yet another instance where the government is messing with things it shouldn't. "The last thing you want to do is hobble one of the world's most successful companies. It will squash innovation and destroy hundreds of billions of dollars in shareholder value – much of which is in retirement plans," said Keith. That said, don't think for a minute the government won't try, he cautioned. "Regulators will try to sell this as a great story. That they are 'doing it for the consumer,' that 'it's intended to foster competition,' that 'you'll have better innovation.' Baloney!" warned Keith. "What the government really wants to preserve their ability to tax commerce." "Instead of trying to help existing and new companies develop, the government wants to compete by punishing the successful. They did it with railroads, with oil, with airlines — and now they're going to do it with technology (and, if this gathers steam, with Alphabet specifically)." "Companies like Alphabet are completely changing the face of what we think about regulation, utilities, government, structure — you name it," said Keith. "The company is unconventional, innovative, and empowering." "It's not surprising to me that it rubs political apparatchicks the wrong way because it bypasses what they consider to be the proper relationship between those who rule and those who follow," Keith told us in wry tones. Should You Still Invest in Alphabet? "Without hesitation — yes, absolutely!" recommends Keith. You see, Alphabet is the digital equivalent of completely free choice — and customers love it. The company offers to consumers efficiency, smarts, and convenience. But you have to do it ahead of time, he urges. Here's why: "Back in the ol' days you could wait for a company to split off, anticipate a pullback, and then buy shares in each of the smaller firms that came of it. In today's high-speed markets, though, you have to be in before the fight starts, so to speak — or risk getting left far behind." Keith says if you're already in the game, stay in. But look to buy more, "even if it's just an additional share." And if you're not already in the game, get in "and start harnessing the innovation that regulators find so threatening." "Alphabet Inc. is lot more valuable than government regulators will ever understand — regulation or not." Editor's Note: "Must-have" companies backed by Unstoppable Trends are a cornerstone of Keith's wealth-building strategy. But there's another type of investment he wants Money Morning Members to know about. It's one of his favorites, a kind of "desert island fund" he'd buy if he had to park his money in only one choice, "retire" from civilization for 20 years, and come back to a pile of money.

Perhaps even more importantly, so do the lessons you learned. That's what Kamakshi Sivaramakrishnan and Stephanie Tilenius, both founders of flourishing start-ups, have discovered. Both had stints at Google. And they both say that working for the tech giant contributed to their success. Here are the five lessons these entrepreneurs took with them from Mountain View, Calif., to their own businesses. Photo by Andrew Toth Founder and CEO of Vida Health Stephanie Tilenius (L) and Founder and CEO of Drawbridge Kamakshi Sivaramakrishnan. 1. Think by the decade "The refreshing thing about Google was that everybody thought really big and though in 10 year time-frames," Tilenius says. She recently addressed the Vanity Fair Founders Fair in New York City about her experiences launching Vida, an app that pairs you with 24/7 access to a health coach. Tilenius remembers presenting Google shopping to Sergey Brin in 2010. Tilenius and her team were thrilled to have demonstrated that an order arrived from a local Best Buy as expected. But Brin was already looking towards the horizon: "I just want balloons from the sky to drop down and put a package in front of your doorstep." Brin was picturing was drone package-delivery at a time when drone package-delivery wasn't much more than a day dream. "That thinking was everywhere" at Google, Tilenius says. Photo by Bloomberg Stephanie Tilenius at Google 2. New products have to be like a toothbrush Larry Page was known for saying that new products have to be like a toothbrush, Tilenius says. What he means is that if you are going to build something, it ought to be a product that consumers are going to use multiple times a day. Vida's first target users have chronic conditions they are managing. And those patients need Vida every day, Tilenius says.

Engineers can do more than code In most tech companies, engineers are relegated to one very specific task: writing computer programs, says Sivaramakrishnan, who is herself an engineer. "Engineers sit in the dungeon and code," she says. "Google is an environment where it is extremely empowering for engineers." Sivaramakrishnan learned to have the confidence to imagine herself as a CEO in her time at Google: "I think that comes from Larry and Sergey from their own engineering background as well." In 2010, she launched Drawbridge, a company that builds technology to connect user's screens and devices without relying their personal security information.

"I haven't seen a company, at the scale of Google — the kind of transparency that is there across the organization — it's a very healthy culture," she says. "Creating an environment of information exchange was very impactful, at least for me, and that I carried forward in the company I founded." Watch this video on The Scene. Google had a weekly all-hands meeting in the time Tilenius worked there and as many as 30,000 employees attended either in person, by phone or by video conference. Eric Schmidt sometimes share confidential corporate information at those meetings. Of course, there was the risk that one of those employees would leak confidential information. But the culture in place strongly discouraged that. To be a Google employee meant that you were trusted. "People are really smart, and you have got to give them the benefit of the doubt," says Tilenius. She has implemented a similar strategy at Vida, and it helps. "To move fast you need full transparency and context." Getty Images A falcon flies over the Chisos Basin in the Big Bend National Park in West Texas. 5. For a project to be important, it has to have scale "The whole notion of scale is so built into you," when you work at Google, says Sivaramakrishnan. "Anything less than 100 million is not worth talking about inside Google." Drawbridge, which has 150 employees, reaches more than 1.3 billion consumers across more than 3.3 billion devices around the globe. Already, it has raised $45.5 million in venture capital. "Anything less than 100 million is not worth talking about inside Google." -Kamakshi Sivaramakrishnan, founder of Drawbridge To be a start-up founder, though, Tilenius had to temporarily "unlearn" the lesson of scale. In the first days of launching Vida, she had to start small. "There were days when I had to say, 'Stop thinking about a hundred million. It's okay. Think about 10, think about 20, think about 100,'" she says. "It's all about the love of those users." When your start-up has processes and products in place, then you start thinking about scale. But that takes time, Tilenius says.

The new tool extends the number of recipes available through the Google Assistant to more than five million. Users can simply say “Ok Google, let’s make…” or they can search for a specific repipe using the Google Search app for iOS and Android and select “Send to Google Home.” From there, users will be able to say “OK Google, start cooking” to commence sequential steps, on command and repeated when necessary. It’ll also be possible to ask how much of a certain ingredient you’ll need. Related: Google Home tips and tricks The company is promising indexed entries from “Bon Appetit, The New York Times, Food Network and many more.” While Assistant had some recipes before, the roll out of this feature over the coming week turns it into a fully fledged cooking aid with more recipes than it’s possible to cook. Given how mucky and moist our phones and tablets have become while following recipes down the years, this is a welcome addition. Check it out in the video below. Unfortunately, Google is only rolling the feature out to US users right now, so it could be a while before Brits get the opportunity to take it for a test drive.

By 10th grade he had attended a half-dozen schools, getting suspended four times and expelled once. While his brothers skipped college, the intellectually gifted Okonofua rose swiftly through academia after landing a scholarship to prestigious St. George’s prep school in Rhode Island. But he never forgot the discipline overkill back in Memphis that held back his brothers and other nonwhite peers. This fall, with backing from tech titan Google, Okonofua, 31, a junior psychology professor at UC Berkeley, will launch an online intervention for more than 100 U.S. school teachers to motivate them to check their biases against African American students before meting out punishment. His approach is the first of its kind. “Teachers are more likely to see black children as troublemakers, and kids who have more suspensions are less likely to go to college and enter top-tier workplaces,” says Okonofua, who co-authored and led seminal studies about racial disparities in school discipline as a doctoral student and postdoctoral fellow at Stanford. Okonofua’s empathy intervention will target teachers in more than 20 middle schools in several southern U.S. states, inspiring them to rethink knee-jerk punitive measures. “My goal is to reverse the downward life trajectory that starts with suspensions and expulsions,” he says. That means stepping in before African Americans and Latinos, who face the most suspensions and expulsions, get to high school and lose trust in the educational system. “Middle school is a pivotal time because teens are navigating multiple teacher relationships while undergoing biological changes as they figure out levels of control and respect,” Okonofua says. “Basically, middle school records predict who will drop out of high school.” Last year, Okonofua led a similar online psychological intervention for about 30 teachers in five California middle schools. The program, which involved reading student testimonials about their relationships with teachers, among other materials, is credited for halving suspensions in those schools. His success caught the attention of Google’s computer science education team, which is keen to partner in innovative projects that bring more underrepresented groups into the tech workforce. The group decided to invest in Okonofua and his research team to help them reach more schools nationwide. “Google and its partners want to reduce the harm that exposure to unconscious bias can have on long-term educational and labor-market outcomes for students in K-12 schools,” says Sepi Hejazi Moghadam, head of Google’s Computer Science Education Research and Evaluation division. “By focusing on educators, we can help them become aware of their unconscious biases and learn how they can adjust their teaching practices to support diverse students’ learning, be it in computer science and STEM or in other fields,” he adds. Concern about the rate of suspensions and expulsions ramped up in 2014 when the U.S. Education Department released data showing that black students were being suspended at three times the rate of white students. While that rate has gradually dropped, racial disparities in school discipline measures persist. In California, for example, black students in 2015 made up 6 percent of the state’s public school students, yet comprised 19 percent of suspensions compared to white students, who faced 4 percent of suspensions. The son of a Nigerian-born economist and an African American nurse, Okonofua grew up in inner-city Memphis. Despite changing schools frequently, Okonofua was a star student taking AP courses. At the end of ninth grade he was sent to a summer program at St. George’s School in Rhode Island, where he excelled academically and took on leadership roles. St. George’s, a private Episcopal boarding school founded in 1896 on a hill overlooking the Atlantic Ocean, was a far cry from his schools in Memphis with their metal detectors and principals roaming the hallways with walkie-talkies. Okonofua is 6-feet-2, broad-shouldered and athletic, and the football coach at St. George’s was keen to recruit him. But Okonofua had other plans: “I didn’t want to be on the athletic track,” he says. His academic performance earned him a full-ride scholarship at St. George’s, followed by undergraduate studies at Northwestern University in Illinois, where he earned bachelor’s degrees in African American studies and psychology. Among other subjects, he studied the psychological repercussions of juvenile detention. This led him to reflect on the racial disparity in discipline during his middle school years and, eventually, to hypothesize that teacher empathy instead of harshness might reverse high rates of suspensions and expulsions, particularly among minorities. He moved out West to Stanford for his Ph.D. and co-authored a study in 2015 that found that teachers are more likely to view black students as troublemakers and discipline them more severely than their nonblack counterparts. The following year, as a postdoctoral fellow, he published an empathy intervention study, which he had led, that reduced suspensions in three school districts. Preparations for his latest teacher empathy intervention started last month, with his research team reviewing school disciplinary records and attending meetings with Google’s education research and evaluation group at the company’s headquarters in Mountain View. “I’m really excited by the possibilities of collaborating with Google’s education team on an innovative way to disrupt discipline problems and the school-to-prison pipeline that hinder black and Latino children from learning the foundations of math and science,” Okonofua says. “Together, we can potentially enhance equity in education outcomes and, in turn, equity in the workplace.” Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Top Stories Campus did ‘everything in its power’...

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Google Reveals List of 80 Chromebooks That Will Soon Get Support For Android Apps By Zara Ali 14 hours ago 13Shares Share Tweet Submit Last year, Google revealed its plans to bring support for Android apps on up to 50 Chromebooks. The original timeline should have got the process completed by the end of 2016, but only six Chromebooks got the support. Now, Google has renewed its list of Chromebooks and announced the names of 80 Chromebooks that will get Android apps support. The new list of Chromebooks includes Samsung’s Chromebook Plus, Chromebook Pro, Chromebook 2, and Chromebook 3. The list segments the devices under “planned,” category, which makes it tentative whether they will receive the support or not. Some devices like the Asus Chromebook Flip C302 and Acer Chromebook R13, are tagged as beta channel, which means that they are currently in beta state, but would soon get the stable channel. Related Lenovo’s Convertible Chromebook Flex 11 Is an Affordable and Sturdy Offering at $279 Advertisement Even though the fact that Google still cares for Chromebooks is welcoming, but we must accept that Google’s Android apps for Chromebooks have been anything but impressive. To recap, one of the first Chromebooks, the Samsung Chromebook Plus was plagued with bugs and issues. Android app support on more Chromebooks would be a nice addition, but our doubts about the “Planned” support for some Chromebooks would hopefully get answered at Google’s I/O developer event next month.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile These Experimental Nighttime Photos Clicked with Nexus 6P and Pixel Are Nothing Less Than Spectacular By Zara Ali 15 hours ago 15Shares Share Tweet Submit Stars above Pierce Point Ranch, 64 2-second exposures, shot with Google Pixel At the time of launching the Pixel smartphones, Google boasted about their phenomenal camera performance with HDR+ mode. Taking the claims ahead, a Googler posted some jaw-dropping low-light pictures clicked by Google Pixel and Nexus 6P smartphones, but by using a custom camera app. According to Google software engineer Florian Kainz, you can take perfect shots on your smartphone by using some tweaks. The spectacular images clicked by Kainz have been subjected to post editing as well, but the main point is that the originality shot was captured by a smartphone camera and it matches the DSLR-level photography. In his blog post, Kainz explained how well Pixel and Nexus 6P can perform in low-light conditions. Related Google-Branded Wireless Headphones With Noise Canceling Show Up at the FCC – Images Kainz’s project got its wings after a small chat session with Google’s Gcam team that works on computational photography. It is the same team that is responsible for HDR+ mode on the Google Pixel, a mode that allows Pixel phones to capture shots in low-light by combining up to 10 burst shots into one. Advertisement Point Reyes lighthouse at night, photographed with Google Nexus 6P by Kainz After going through the normal images clicked by Google Pixel and Nexus 6P, Kainz decided to take better shots with the small camera sensors on these phones. To test his idea, Kainz came up with a simple camera app geared with manual controls over exposure time, ISO, and focus distance. The picture of the Point Reyes Lighthouse at night was Kainz’s first test output that was taken with the Nexus 6P by using 32 frames at 4-second exposure and ISO 1600. After clicking this picture, Kainz took 32 black frames and then exported all the RAW files to photoshop, which computed the mean of all 32 frames and got rid of grain. After that, the mean of the 32 frames was substracted that removed grid-like patterns. By the end of the post-processing, the final image looked nothing less than amazing. Kainz did not stop at one amazing photo, he decided to collect more amazing photos and do more tests and apply more editing tricks. The final images of his tests can easily be used as wallpapers for your device. The pictures posted below are taken by Google Pixel phone that supports maximum 2-second exposures. Kainz believes that more exposure could make low-light photos even better on smartphones – provided if there is tripod at disposal and the subject is constant. These photos from Pixel phone were taken in June and July, last year, before the official launch of the phone. We can only hope to get an in-built tool for Android camera that would do most of these tweaks automatically for low-light photography. Or maybe, Google could introduce such tools in Google Photos.

There is an almost endless list of Siri features that can turn your digital personal assistant into a powerful force to answer your questions in a snap, make your life simpler and even play your favorite music. If you recently spotted Cookie Monster saying, “Hey Siri set a timer.” this Siri guide will show you everything you need to know about how it works. After using Siri for a few year’s we discovered a collection of hidden Siri features as well as a number of Siri tips and tricks that only come to light when you get past the basics of setting an alarm and making a phone call. Over the past two years Apple made Siri more reliable, which adds more value and power to these Siri tips and tricks. These hidden Siri features are not locked behind a special code and there is no need to use the iOS 10 jailbreak to unlock them. No, these Siri features are available to everyone on iOS 9 or higher, but most users have no clue that these features exist, or how to use them. Use these 50+ Siri tips and tricks to master the latest Siri features and do more with your iPhone and iPad. In this look at 60+ hidden Siri features we’ll dive deep into the personal assistant to show users the lesser known tasks Siri is capable of. While Siri users will surely know a few things on this list already, we expect everyone will learn a few tricks. We’ll start with a few Siri tricks that users are more likely to know and move into the lesser known. Hidden Siri Features The eight minute video below walks through these Siri features that users will find on the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. These features can help you do more with Siri and avoid typing and even unlocking your iPhone in some cases. 1. Use Hey Siri for Hands free Access Apple recently enlisted Cookie Monster to show off the Hey Siri feature on the iPhone 6s, as he longs for a timer to finish so he can eat cookies. If you own the iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus you can say, “Hey Siri” anytime to access all the features listed below. You don’t need to be connected to power for this to work, and it is an awesome way to build Siri into your daily life. We use it to check the weather, set timers, turn off all alarms and much more. Turn this on by going to Settings -> Siri -> Hey Siri -> On. Then follow the setup procedures. Say. “Hey Siri” to turn Siri on at anytime. If you own an older device you can still use Hey Siri, but only when plugged into power. It’s still very handy for checking things while the phone is charging on your nightstand or desk. 2.Remind Me About This When you are looking at a webpage or an app you can say Remind me about this and Siri will take what you are looking at add it to a reminder. You can combine this with remind me at a certain time or remind me at a place and you’ll no longer need to copy and paste something or describe it in a reminder. Just have it open on your screen and say “Remind me about this.” 3. Get an Uber With Siri How to get an Uber ride with Siri. Siri now connects to a variety of apps. You can say Get me an Uber home, or to a specific place and you’ll see the ride summary with an option to book it. You can also hail a Lyft. You’ll need to set this up in Settings -> Siri -> App Support and be logged in to the Uber or Lyft app. 4. Check Sports Scores, Schedule, Channel and More Use Siri to check Sports data and info. Whenever you need to know who is winning a major league or college game for popular sports just ask Siri what the score is for the team name, or ask when the team plays next to get ready to watch. You can ask, Did the “team name” win? How did “team name” do last night? What was the score the last time the “team name” played the “team name”?  When do the “team name” play next? What basket ball games are on today? What channel is the Red Sox game on? Who’s the best team in Hockey? Get me College basketball rankings Show me the roster for the “team name” Who is pitching for “team name” this season? This works for a wide variety of sports and you can also use Siri to find out when minor league teams play. 5. Google Instead of Bing Force Siri to search Google instead of Bing. When you search for something with Siri the iPhone searches Bing. If you don’t like Bing, like many users, you can still use Google. Instead of asking Siri a question or a search you need to say, “Search Google for ..” and then whatever you want. This will get you the Google search results. 6. Open Favorite Apps For now you cannot control other apps like Spotify with Siri, but you can open the app which makes using it that much easier. This is handy to use while at a stoplight or when walking to your car. Use Siri to open the app and get it ready so you can tap on a playlist and get going. You will need to unlock the iPhone to open the app. 7. Get Voice Feedback All the Time If you want Siri to read back your messages before sending them and talk back to you when you ask the service to do something go to Settings -> General -> Siri -> Voice Feedback -> On. Now Siri will talk whenever you ask for something. You can also choose to only hear this when using a handsfree device. A recent upgrade allows you to set this to work with the mute switch on the side of the iPhone so that you will only hear voice feedback when your phone is not on silent. This is overruled when using Hey Siri or when connected to a handsfree device, 8. Find Out How Late a Store is Open You can now ask Siri how late a store is open. Say, “How late is store name open?” and if it is a known store with posted hours you will get the hours for that day, the reviews, distance to the store and a small map. Check store hours using Siri. 9. Set Reminders for Locations Once Siri knows where you live and work you can tell the assistant to remind you to do something when you get to a location. Just say, “Remind me to grab the eggs when I get home.” Or, if you need to make sure you take something when you leave a location say, “Remind me to take the report when I leave.” This is handy for locations like hotels or meetings. If you say a location and Siri doesn’t know it, like Work, you can fill n the details. With iOS 9 and iOS 10 you can even say Remind me when I get to my car, if you pair your iPhone with a car Bluetooth system. 10. Find Photos Using Siri You can use Siri to find photos using time and location. Simply say “Show me photos from last week” or you can go with last year or any other date range. Siri can search your photos by voice. You can also say show me photos from a specific city or location and you’ll see your photos. Other options include “Show me my selfies.” and “Show me my videos.” 11. Convert Measurements Need to convert gallons to cups or cups to ounces? How about miles to kilometers or inches to centimeters? Say, “How many x are in y?” and Siri can convert the measurements for you. 12. Find Out How Long Until Your Arrive If you are using the iPhone for navigation and you need to know how long you have left to get to a location simply ask Siri, “What’s my ETA” and she will provide an estimate. This is handy while driving especially if the route changes or traffic is worse than anticipated. 13. Search for Recent Tweets If you want to know what someone is tweeting about without opening up Twitter, just say, ” What is person’s name saying?” You can also ask what a brand or website is saying and it will show you their recent tweets. 14. Teach Siri How to Pronounce Names If Siri constantly butchers names of your contacts simply say “Learn how to pronounce contact name.” When prompted pronounce the first name and then pick an option and then the last name and pick an option. 15. Search Your Notes Say, “Find my note about keyword” and Siri will show any notes in the Notes app with that topic in the title or in the text of the note. Perfect for finding a note you need fast.

Glad, I saw the video. Thanks. 03/13/2014 pete Reply Well, the first thing Siri would tell you is that the plural of the word “year” does not include an apostrophe. In fact, NO word in its plural form requires an apostrophe. They teach that in 2nd grade, but apparently not in internet journalism school. 03/18/2014 Archibald Reply This mom is blessed!

One, finding a parking, and two, remembering where it is you parked. Google Map’s latest feature update ensures the latter comes a bit more easily. “Now, Google Maps for Android and iOS will not only help you get where you’re going, but it’ll help you remember where you parked once you’ve arrived,” Google Map’s project manager Jeff Albertson announces in a blog. For users who engage with Maps regularly, simply tapping the blue location dot with bring up a menu with “save your parking” an a new option. “You’ll see a label on the map itself identifying where you parked your car. Tap on that label to open up your parking card, where you can add additional details about your parking spot,” Albertson adds. Users can also add notes to the card, like info about when you free parking expires. If you’re really forgetful, you can also save an image of your parking and surrounds, and send the location to more reliable people in your life. iOS also gets automatic parking detection that uses USB audio and Bluetooth to automatically track when you leave your ride. The update is live on both platforms at the time of writing.

Name: Subject: Message: You can now learn to cook with some help from Google Home Newsby John Callaham12 hours ago 102 9 If you are hopeless in the kitchen, then maybe you just need a little help on how to make some great meals for family or friends. Today, Google announced it is adding support for teaching people how to cook with the help of its Google Home connected speaker and its Google Assistant service. See also: Bixby vs Google Assistant vs Siri 2 days ago The new feature will allow anyone accessing Google Assistant to get step-by-step instructions on how to make over 5 million different recipes, from sources like Bon Appetit, The New York Times, Food Network and more. You begin by searching and finding the recipe you want to learn to make via Google Search or Google Assistant. Then you can press the “Send to Google Home” button, which will save the recipe you picked to the speaker. If you can’t decide on a specific recipe, you can say something like, “Ok Google, let’s make chicken” and Assistant will offer up a random one for you to create. After you pick one, all you have to do is say, “Ok Google, start cooking” or “Ok Google, start recipe” at the speaker. Google Home should then begin going over how to cook your dish. If you get stuck, or need to hear something from the list again, you can say, “Ok Google, repeat” to go back a step. Google says this new recipe feature has just started rolling out, so it may take a few days to reach your phone or Google Home speaker. This could be a huge help for novice cooks who want to learn how to make good meals without burning the kitchen down. It could also help experienced chefs who don’t want to go through printed cookbooks to learn how to make new dishes. Do you think this new recipe feature for Google Home will convince you to spend more time in the kitchen? Let us know what you think in the comments!

[Update: Just headphones for employees] Google-branded wireless headphones show up at the FCC Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/26 10:28am PDTApr 26, 2017 82 Plus 1 on G+ 136 Share on Facebook 111 Share on Twitter Total Shares329 Google News Update 1: 2017/04/26 10:30am PDT An anonymous tipster has shed some light on what these almost certainly are. Google issues headphones to a large number of its employees, and the current model is getting quite Well this is... unexpected. We've heard whispers of a new Google Home/Google WiFi combo, and even the next Pixel devices, but nothing in the realm of audio products. Out of nowhere, a set of headphones from Google have appeared in a new FCC filing. The headphones, which are identified as 'GID5B,' are definitely a bit odd. One side has a power button, and the other a simple Google logo, both in a circle matching Google's logo colors. According to the documents, these headphones support Bluetooth connectivity - but there doesn't appear to be any mention of a microphone. As with many wireless headphones, there is an AUX connector if you don't want to mess with Bluetooth. Strangely, there is a microUSB port for charging - not USB Type-C. According to the user manual included in the FCC filing, GID5B has a 600mAh battery. It's very possible that this was filed to get clearance on the internal radio, which could later be included on a different pair of headphones. The microUSB port, lack of microphone functionality, and no Google Assistant features seems to back up this claim. It would be a bit strange for Google to release headphones without any unique functionality, using an old port. Update 1: 2017/04/26 10:30am PDT An anonymous tipster has shed some light on what these almost certainly are. Google issues headphones to a large number of its employees, and the current model is getting quite long in the tooth. We've got a picture of it below. As you can see, it bears the same power button iconography as the ones in the FCC filing above. These headphones are distributed for use only inside Google and are not sold anywhere - they're just for Googlers. This new ANC Bluetooth version is just an update on the design, probably meant to replace these older headsets as they're phased out. So, no: Google is not releasing a really ugly wireless headphone with a microUSB port and no microphone. Well, not to anyone except Googlers.

Not Google's... #facepalm FRGuzman That's actually Google's official merchandise store. Admittedly, it does look fake. It's run by a third party company that has the license to produce merchandise with G's logo, though. MJ How do we know this? Source? Why would Google use like a 3rd rate company for this? Anyone have a link from Google's website to that site? Gobelet The SSL certificate was delivered by Google themselves. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2ec49ef6e0020e3a0c8436a7f6610146bd0e573f443b2d220fc2a5baf5ed48be.png MJ Well played sir... Best proof after a half dozen comments. Again, why have a third rate looking store site that looks like crap/fake? FRGuzman I did some research on it a couple of months ago as I was looking for a Google decal and stumbled upon this website and it looked kinda shady to me too. I can't recall all the evidence I gathered but I ended up convinced it was legit. I'd say Google doesn't care too much about branded merchandising and they off loaded it to a third party company that in my opinion doesn't even offer compeling or quality looking goods. Shagnscooby Weird. I knew they had a merch store but I certainly didn't think there was electronics there that weren't on the store.google.com They must not make or design the merch ones and it's just a logo slapped on. MJ They don't... It's a fake store. Shagnscooby It's not fake. I've done telephone survey's for Google and one of the payment options was a Google Merch store gift card instead of other gift cards. MJ Google does telephone surveys? Who even answers telephone surveys or picks up on unrecognized numbers? mog386 Wrong. It's legit. Lol. You dolt. "About Robertson Marketing Robertson is Google’s branded merchandise partner in North America. With team members and offices in Silicon Valley and across the United States, in Canada, and in the United Kingdom, Robertson serves numerous Fortune 500 clients, including global technology leaders such as Google.

MJ Really? You had go with the name calling? I don't care what the fucking website says... It doesn't look legit at all. Even if they have the rights to slap the Google logo on shit they aren't Google's products. The OP was wrong about the headphones. Aaron Berlin I'm guessing those are just white label goods with Google branding on them, so GOOG wouldn't actually file with the FCC. Maybe??? MJ It's not official merchandise! It's fake! mog386 Wrong. It's legit. Lol. "About Robertson Marketing Robertson is Google’s branded merchandise partner in North America.

David Ruddock I'm sorry, but not even close. MJ LOL I beat you to it David. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I mean they are both headphones... Dan Proctor Mentioned it above but my comment was aimed at these going into their merchandise store vs a real consumer product. My company offers the same generic branded things that go through the FCC as our own products. Very common among the bigger companies of the world. David Ruddock They could, but seeing as we've never seen any headphones go through under Google's name before, I have my doubts. Dan Proctor As in these look like they will be going into this store. Same as other people have said about them being the generic items Google offers at events and to employees. David Mendívil if this thing has an internal FM radio receiver (analog), I will get one Sashank Narayan What mainstream headphones even have that capability? Justin W I can answer this: none. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And why? FM radio still exists? David Mendívil dude, not everyone lives in EEUU or EUROPE, most of the human population still hears analogical radio stations Matt It's not just a Europe thing. I live in the US and I have not listened to FM radio in years. Erstam Same. I despise analog radio. Do many commercials plus it usually sounds like crap. DanSan I don't even know where the FM radio button is in my car. /s yes i do but you get the point. David Mendívil Sorry EEUU is USA in Spanish hehe but at least in south america, it is quite common to still have the good old FM radio stations, having a data plan is still too expensive Matt Oh, right. I even know that. I think having it right next to EUROPE my brain just combined it all. podme Probably giveaways to employees and swag for events, etc Jarrett Lennon Kaufman They'd be better off rebranding OEM headphones for just that, though, and could skip this process. Mordalo I'm more concerned about the sound quality. If they sound good and don't break my bank account (or my mortgage payment), I'd be happy to get another set of good Bluetooth cans. They don't need to be always on or listening (even though this is Google). mlm5em Sees Headline: Must buy immediately Sees Mirco USB: Run away T4rd What wireless headphones (or any phone/PC accessories) have USB-C ports yet? Erstam My phone is usb c. My Chromebook only had usb c. I have a mouse and keyboard that are usb c. My battery pack is usb c. Come to the future brother. It's great!. I use the same cable to charge everything normally too. I actually had the same thought as the guy above. I'm not buying anything that's not usb c any more. It's not future proof and i rarely have to carry a non c cable anymore (except on a trip i bring an extra micro usb for my gf s7). T4rd So your mouse and keyboard.. that's pretty much it. I agree, I would only like to buy USB C accessories as well, but it seems they're not picking it up any time soon still. catalysto So you're being purposefully obtuse. T4rd Likewise. catalysto That's a yes. T4rd For you. DanSan https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5e55bc06067cf74753d28062e8aaf21244bf97f17ad555a1d4b58976f73be2bf.gif catalysto Interesting angle you took there. T4rd You trying to be (a)cute? =p Charles https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/04c3103885fe90c9fac6a716024d3ffabaa2c2d1637efd9143fe07e90fbe15f3.jpg matteventu Which USB-C mouse have you got? I was looking for one to replace my MAX Anywhere 2. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Lol. This is ridiculously ugly T4rd Headphones with Cast built in..? Could be cool. marcusmarcus2 That is the first thing I thought when I read the headline makapav That would be a pretty good idea - as long as it also has a mic for calls and gives the option for filtering in ambient sound/noise when needed. Rinkesh621 How about cast and miniature Google home, so you can order pizza, while you stream your music from your Spotify while you watch e-sport games with Picture in Picture of watching old Charlie Chaplin silent film? No.... just a though. lol SpeakethTheTruth Sounds like a Pimp My Ride episode. Lateef Alabi-Oki 600mAh battery for a headphone? What are they aiming for? A week long battery life. Jay I'd probably buy them because Google. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ 4Ui812 They'll probably have issues out of the box because .... Google ¯_(ツ)_/ Mohamed Fixaal And they'll later release 10 new headphones and change their names later in because Google.. ¯_(ツ)_/ David’s Flattop Reigns Supreme Wow, Its a trifecta of wisdom!! Diego Opazo SV-Cross ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ After that they'll release a companion app ecosystem only to abandon them altogether because ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Ray And then one model will shut down randomly with 35% battery still remaining. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ David’s Flattop Reigns Supreme even more helpful.... Nexus✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Guess I've gotten mostly lucky, my two galaxy nexus, nexus 4, 5, 7, google home, chromecasts, nexus player, and pixel didn't have problems out of the box. my 5x developed crazy slowness over time rendering it barely useful (and I've flashed all sorts of roms and formatted storage and disabled encryption). Nigel Antonio im right there with you, but ad a nexus 1. and a Pixel to the mix. Dennis Lockhart Maybe but they'll be in 'beta' so a fix is just down the road a bit. ;-) 4Ui812 LOL Andrey Simakov They are Google because Google. David’s Flattop Reigns Supreme Well that was helpfull Glen Barrington Then they'll abandon the whole thing because Google.. ¯_(ツ)_/ John Marshall’s Ghost Why isn't this USB C? I have a Pixel XL and my wife has the Nexus 5X. We have switched our lives over to USB C. Why would I want to carry around another cable or an adapter just for a set of headphones? I have not been able to find a set of USB C wireless headphones and for the life of me, I can't understand why. vmxr ugly Cael That G looks like a Q to mean. Clearly the Nexus Q2 /s Thomas Larsen It's a power button Cael I was being sarcastic... Thomas Larsen I know, even without the /s makiller The manual showing an aux cable included reinforces for me that Google will keep the headphone jack on the next Pixel again. I doubt they'd include an aux cord with their new branded headphones if their new branded phone couldn't even use it..... right? These are kind of ugly though. ITGuy11 Right. Cause your going to need that headphone jack due to Pixel 2 Bluetooth issues ¯_(ツ)_/¯ JG Counter point... That assumes everyone at Google will be using the Pixel 2. I would imagine some (especially those developing for iOS) use iPhones. And several probably carry around Galaxy devices etc... You don't have to eat McDonalds for every meal just because you work there... You're also further assuming the aux cord is to be plugged into the phone. Maybe the aux port is included so the headphones can connect to the employee's computer terminal. Or maybe the equipment in the campus gym, like at my gym, lack bluetooth and need a wired connection in order to listen to the built in TV/music player. Or since Google will only need a small quantity I would imagine it would probably have been easier and cheaper just to use parts already in production rather than asking whoever is actually building them to create custom hardware for a relatively small order. That would also explain why the charge port is microUSB and not USB-C. DanSan just curious, is there a reason why you'd expect a microphone for these? I'm just guessing here but these don't look like gaming or professional use headphones which would be the only time they might require a mic. This looks more like trying to capture the hype of other products like beats. No idea but do beats have a built in mic? I get it, maybe it would be good for assistant if it had a mic but not sure i see lack of microphone a drawback, especially when similar headphones dont have them matteventu For... Calls? DanSan do other headphones that look or fit in this same category have the same functionality? i only ask because the article is written as if not having a mic is a knock against the product yet i dont think anything else in this space has a mic. Miku is Best Vocaloid Most of them do. matteventu Aurevoir 3.5mm jack on Pixel 2. Damnit. Fr0gg0 It's not like anyone outside Google would want to wear those. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Never underestimate the power of branding. sebastianer Yeah....for less than 150€ you can get some AKG K701s headphones.(that you can mod if you need more Low frequency). And for 100 USD you can get a Schiit Fulla 2 amazing DAC and reasonable good amp. That's all you need for a decent audio quality nowadays. Tom Harman Yes Please! Jeffrey Spiers I'll be scouring Ebay for these... icyhotmike Supported for 3 months and then left dry to die a slow and unfixed death -Every Google product KRS_Won Google Listen™ Built with Cast® I'd prob buy em. Rinkesh621 Those earmuff bezels tho ! Complimentary with Pixel 2? Alfonso Surroca It's a shame this headset is internal-only. A Google headset such as this would fit nicely with their consumer product mix, especially if it only worked in conjunction with all-new dedicated messaging and voice apps. G Suite Headset Messenger by Google has a nice ring to it. Rod Moore What is this AUX you speak of? All of Goggles phones have USB-C ports. Plus the Chromebooks are coming out with USB-C. Very odd to be using a older USB auxiliary port. hzd Bluetooth Google headphones . . . Haha expect less work to get done at Google from here on in, Google's relationship with any BT is always Rocky ! Still got BT issues with the Nexus 5 and 6 to this day connecting to my Fords headunit and my parrot unit in my personal car. whispy_snippet Update your phone.

Hyper-target and remarket to past users. The internet is a rabbit hole of information. With over one billion websites in the ether, and over half of those active, the process of getting found online is much more complex than launching a website and hoping people will come across it. A solid search engine optimization (SEO) strategy is one way to rank well on the search engine results pages (SERPs), but this is a time consuming and ongoing process, and in competitive markets, it does not always yield first-page results. For those looking to land on the first page of Google, appear where prospective leads are hanging out online, and increase brand awareness, pay-per-click advertising with Google Adwords is the best way to do it. Here are three ways to use Google AdWords to generate leads for your business. Search advertising Search advertising is what most people think of when they hear the term pay-per-click. Advertisers are able to bid on certain keywords (such as “real estate Boston” or “Los Angeles real estate agent”) and appear at the top of the SERPs when these queries are performed. The best thing about this form of advertising is you only pay when someone actually clicks on your ad and lands on your website. The amount you pay per click depends on how many other advertisers are bidding on the same word or search term, and your bid can be adjusted so you’re certain to appear on that coveted first page. Academic research shows that 91 percent of searchers do not go past the first page of Google, so if you can’t do it organically, pay-per-click is the next best option. Display advertising Display ads are image ads placed on websites throughout the internet. Using Display advertising on Google AdWords is essential for brand awareness and is one of the most cost-effective ways to get your name and brand out to a targeted audience. With display advertising, you can choose the websites your ads appear on and target your ads by interest, location, demographics, in-market and affinity audiences, and you can choose whether you pay per click, impression or acquisition (conversion). Although display advertising has a lower conversion rate than search advertising, when the two campaign types are leveraged together, they produce maximum results. Remarketing You are most likely familiar with remarketing ads by now. Although they seem creepy to begin with, these laser targeted ads, which “follow” you after visiting certain websites, are highly effective as they serve as reminders of products or services that you have already shown interest in. Remarketing ads are essential for staying front of mind with potential leads. After a visitor has landed on your website (either through a Google AdWords campaign, social media, organically or from a referral site), a cookie is stored on their computer. This allows you to create a specific display ad with a strong call to action targeting this audience as they browse online. Click-thru-rates and conversions with remarketing campaigns are often higher, and return on ad spend (ROAS) is greater with this hyper-targeted form of online advertising. For those who haven’t tried Google AdWords yet, now is a great time to start. Activate a simple AdWords Express Account, spend some time getting to know the AdWords interface or hire someone to do it for you. Google AdWords is one of the most effective ways to send highly targeted leads to your website, and the best part is, you only pay per click.

Ever have a mini panic attack because you couldn't remember where you parked your car? You may never have to live through that frustrating situation again, thanks to Google. The company on Tuesday introduced a new Google Maps feature for iOS and Android that will help you remember where you parked. On Android (pictured above), tap the blue dot and press "Save your parking" to add your spot to the map. From there, you'll see a label on the map identifying where you left your car. You can tap that label to add additional details like the exact spot number, an image of your parking spot, and the amount of time before the meter expires. The app will even give you a reminder 15 minutes before your meter expires, if you enter this information. You can also send your parking location to friends. Related 23 Google Maps Tricks You Need to Try 23 Google Maps Tricks You Need to Try The experience is similar on iOS: just tap the blue dot and select "Set as parking location." From there, you can tap on the parking label to share it with friends or view photos of your parking area. Google Maps for iOS also offers an automatic parking detection feature that should make things even easier, should you choose to set it up. Connect the app to your car using USB audio or Bluetooth and your parking spot will be automatically added to the map when you disconnect and exit the vehicle, Google Maps Product Manager Jeff Albertson explained in a blog post. The update comes after Google in January introduced a new beta Maps feature that gives you a heads up about the parking situation near your destination, so you can be mentally prepared if parking is limited. The Google-owned traffic and navigation app Waze, meanwhile, has a "where to park" feature that can help you locate a spot, as well as a "where I parked" option.

Prosecutors said police started probing Charles Flores after officials at Google alerted the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children that two child pornography images had been uploaded to Flores’ Google account in September 2016 – a gmail account in Flores’ name. When investigators traced the account to Flores’ home on 38th Street, near Broadway, he admitted he downloaded files containing the images to an external hard drive. “The defendant admitted that his curiosity became an obsession and that he sought out, downloaded and saved several thousand images and videos of children – some as young as five years old – being sexually abused by adults,” Queens District Attorney Richard Brown said. “These are not just pictures and videos. They are for all intents and purposes crime scene photos of children being sexually abused. They are real people who will have to live with the abuse they suffered for the rest of their lives,” Brown said. “This defendant will go to prison as a result of his actions.” Flores was arrested at his home near Broadway in Long Island City in December 2016, and was charged with 30 counts of possessing images of a sexual performance by a child. Flores told investigators he began collecting and hoarding the images, in the beginning, to help his girlfriend, and that it became an obsession, prosecutors said. During a forensic preview of Flores’ external hard drive, investigators found 20 images of prepubescent children roughly between the ages of 5 and 12, being sexually abused by adult males, prosecutors said. Further forensic analysis of the hard drive, as well as other electronic devices recovered from Flores’ home, revealed hundreds of videos and images of children as young as 4 years old being sexually abused by adults, prosecutors said. Flores is facing one to three years in prison at his sentencing on June 12. 2017-04-26 / Features Suspect Arraigned On Murder Indictment In Death Of Howard Beach Jogger Back to index First-In-The-Nation Excelsior Scholarship Program Return to top Loading ...

By Kelly Cioe Posted April 26, 2017, at 1:12 p.m. With the explosion of connected lifestyles, voice-activated technology has become a popular method of communicating with mobile and connected devices. Controlling these smart devices was once a click, swipe, or touch away, but now all it takes are a few simple words. In fact, according to a recent U.S. Cellular survey, 36 percent of smartphone owners use a virtual assistant daily and 30 percent use smart home technology on a daily basis1. Recent advancements in speech recognition technology have made a voice-controlled smart home completely attainable, and many of the gadgets that promise to get the job done are already in stores. Voice-controlled technology is now used for everything from thermostats and appliances to connected cars and personal assistants. “U.S. Cellular delivers a fast, high-quality network with national network coverage allowing our customers to access information and entertainment simply by asking their devices,” states Matt Kasper, director of sales for U.S. Cellular in New England. “As this trend of voice-activated devices grows, U.S. Cellular is here to make the new technology simpler and less overwhelming for our customers, whether they’re interested in the latest device or connected home solution.” The number of connected Internet of Things (IoT) devices and sensors are expected to increase 200 percent to 46 billion by 2021, according to Juniper Research. With so many products on the market, U.S. Cellular recommends the following ways voice-controlled technology can help simplify and enhance life at home and on the go. Personal Assistant: Many of us are already connected on a first name basis with Siri (IOS) and Google Now (Android) – the popular voice-activated personal assistants through our smartphones. In fact, according to Comcast 50 percent of all searches will be voice searches by 2020. Through our smartphones we can access our calendars, contacts, get the latest news and weather, and control other smart devices. At Home: One of the newest voice-activated home speakers is Google Home ($129), which is powered by the Google Assistant. It gives you hands-free assistance in the home to get the latest weather, traffic and news; connect to your music, videos and photos through Google Play, Pandora, Netflix, Google Photos and more; and control your home through connectivity with Nest and other smart home devices. The ultimate couch potato will want a new Smart TV that can be controlled by voice technology through a smartphone or Google Home. Searching for the remote control will become a thing of the past as users can operate the TV simply with their voice to turn it on and off, change channels, access apps and navigate the web. Wearables: Users can stay connected to people and information, track daily activity, measure workouts and monitor health. The Apple Watch Series 2 ($369-$399) makes this possible by lifting your wrist and asking “Hey Siri”. In the Car: Those without an in-car Bluetooth system or that just prefer a certified HD voice for full, natural sound, the Plantronics Explorer 500 ($59.99) is a great way to stay hands-free while driving. Voice control allows users to listen to music, get directions and answer calls. Plantronics Explorer works with Siri (IOS), Google Now (Android) and Cortana (Microsoft). Whether looking for more connected devices, family plans, or the latest high-tech devices, U.S. Cellular offers free monthly Device Workshops to help smartphone users get the most out of their iPhone 7 or Samsung Galaxy S8. U.S. Cellular offers Device Workshops for the entire community, including those who are not U.S. Cellular customers, and they provide a great opportunity to learn more about the many features of today’s smart devices – including those controlled by voice.

By: Samden Sherpa Updated: Wednesday, April 26, 2017, 23:00 [IST] Lately, Google has been adding new features across it various platforms like Google Maps, YouTube, Google Search, and others. More recently, the company announced an update to its Google Translate and Chrome browser. Against such backdrop, Google is rolling out a new version of Chrome to Android devices. While the new version is already available for Mac, Linux, and Windows systems, the version for Android is getting useful features and some performance as well as stability fixes. The company has said that the new Chrome 58 (58.0.3029.83) for Android will be available on Google Play over the course of the next week. SEE ALSO: Google adds support for nine Indian languages to Google Translate, Chrome and Gboard However, as the focus has been put more on performance and stability related issues Chrome 58 update does bring new capabilities.

Better Download Management As per the company the download feature is enhanced in Chrome 58 for Android. Users will now be able to easily view and manage the in-progress downloads under the Downloads page. Redesigned History Page and New Tabs Feature The new update brings a redesigned History page. Users will be able to view and clear their browsing data easily. Moreover, the History tab now has a dedicated view instead of just a regular page with a visible URL bar. The "clear browsing data" button has been moved higher up the page from the bottom, while the icon to delete sites has been changed to trash icon instead of ‘x.' SEE ALSO: Xiaomi and Google launch new 360-degree camera Users can now long-press a link to open it in a new Chrome tab from Chrome Custom Tabs. Full-screen Web Apps If users open a web app through the Chrome browser, it will open up in full screen.

[Update: Just headphones for employees] Google-branded wireless headphones show up at the FCC Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/26 10:28am PDTApr 26, 2017 82 Plus 1 on G+ 136 Share on Facebook 111 Share on Twitter Total Shares329 Google News Update 1: 2017/04/26 10:30am PDT An anonymous tipster has shed some light on what these almost certainly are. Google issues headphones to a large number of its employees, and the current model is getting quite Well this is... unexpected. We've heard whispers of a new Google Home/Google WiFi combo, and even the next Pixel devices, but nothing in the realm of audio products. Out of nowhere, a set of headphones from Google have appeared in a new FCC filing. The headphones, which are identified as 'GID5B,' are definitely a bit odd. One side has a power button, and the other a simple Google logo, both in a circle matching Google's logo colors. According to the documents, these headphones support Bluetooth connectivity - but there doesn't appear to be any mention of a microphone. As with many wireless headphones, there is an AUX connector if you don't want to mess with Bluetooth. Strangely, there is a microUSB port for charging - not USB Type-C. According to the user manual included in the FCC filing, GID5B has a 600mAh battery. It's very possible that this was filed to get clearance on the internal radio, which could later be included on a different pair of headphones. The microUSB port, lack of microphone functionality, and no Google Assistant features seems to back up this claim. It would be a bit strange for Google to release headphones without any unique functionality, using an old port. Update 1: 2017/04/26 10:30am PDT An anonymous tipster has shed some light on what these almost certainly are. Google issues headphones to a large number of its employees, and the current model is getting quite long in the tooth. We've got a picture of it below. As you can see, it bears the same power button iconography as the ones in the FCC filing above. These headphones are distributed for use only inside Google and are not sold anywhere - they're just for Googlers. This new ANC Bluetooth version is just an update on the design, probably meant to replace these older headsets as they're phased out. So, no: Google is not releasing a really ugly wireless headphone with a microUSB port and no microphone. Well, not to anyone except Googlers.

Gobelet The SSL certificate was delivered by Google themselves. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2ec49ef6e0020e3a0c8436a7f6610146bd0e573f443b2d220fc2a5baf5ed48be.png MJ Well played sir... Best proof after a half dozen comments. Again, why have a third rate looking store site that looks like crap/fake? FRGuzman I did some research on it a couple of months ago as I was looking for a Google decal and stumbled upon this website and it looked kinda shady to me too. I can't recall all the evidence I gathered but I ended up convinced it was legit. I'd say Google doesn't care too much about branded merchandising and they off loaded it to a third party company that in my opinion doesn't even offer compeling or quality looking goods. Shagnscooby Weird. I knew they had a merch store but I certainly didn't think there was electronics there that weren't on the store.google.com They must not make or design the merch ones and it's just a logo slapped on. MJ They don't... It's a fake store. Shagnscooby It's not fake. I've done telephone survey's for Google and one of the payment options was a Google Merch store gift card instead of other gift cards. MJ Google does telephone surveys? Who even answers telephone surveys or picks up on unrecognized numbers? mog386 Wrong. It's legit. Lol. You dolt. "About Robertson Marketing Robertson is Google’s branded merchandise partner in North America. With team members and offices in Silicon Valley and across the United States, in Canada, and in the United Kingdom, Robertson serves numerous Fortune 500 clients, including global technology leaders such as Google. The Robertson team manages the online Google Merchandise Store and the Google campus store in Mountain View, California, and serves as a preferred provider for special order Google branded products." MJ Really? You had go with the name calling? I don't care what the fucking website says... It doesn't look legit at all. Even if they have the rights to slap the Google logo on shit they aren't Google's products. The OP was wrong about the headphones. Aaron Berlin I'm guessing those are just white label goods with Google branding on them, so GOOG wouldn't actually file with the FCC. Maybe??? MJ It's not official merchandise! It's fake! mog386 Wrong. It's legit. Lol. "About Robertson Marketing Robertson is Google’s branded merchandise partner in North America.

David Ruddock I'm sorry, but not even close. MJ LOL I beat you to it David. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I mean they are both headphones... Dan Proctor Mentioned it above but my comment was aimed at these going into their merchandise store vs a real consumer product. My company offers the same generic branded things that go through the FCC as our own products. Very common among the bigger companies of the world. David Ruddock They could, but seeing as we've never seen any headphones go through under Google's name before, I have my doubts. Dan Proctor As in these look like they will be going into this store. Same as other people have said about them being the generic items Google offers at events and to employees. David Mendívil if this thing has an internal FM radio receiver (analog), I will get one Sashank Narayan What mainstream headphones even have that capability? Justin W I can answer this: none. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And why? FM radio still exists? David Mendívil dude, not everyone lives in EEUU or EUROPE, most of the human population still hears analogical radio stations Matt It's not just a Europe thing. I live in the US and I have not listened to FM radio in years. Erstam Same. I despise analog radio. Do many commercials plus it usually sounds like crap. DanSan I don't even know where the FM radio button is in my car. /s yes i do but you get the point. David Mendívil Sorry EEUU is USA in Spanish hehe but at least in south america, it is quite common to still have the good old FM radio stations, having a data plan is still too expensive Matt Oh, right. I even know that. I think having it right next to EUROPE my brain just combined it all. podme Probably giveaways to employees and swag for events, etc Jarrett Lennon Kaufman They'd be better off rebranding OEM headphones for just that, though, and could skip this process. Mordalo I'm more concerned about the sound quality. If they sound good and don't break my bank account (or my mortgage payment), I'd be happy to get another set of good Bluetooth cans. They don't need to be always on or listening (even though this is Google). mlm5em Sees Headline: Must buy immediately Sees Mirco USB: Run away T4rd What wireless headphones (or any phone/PC accessories) have USB-C ports yet? Erstam My phone is usb c. My Chromebook only had usb c. I have a mouse and keyboard that are usb c. My battery pack is usb c. Come to the future brother. It's great!. I use the same cable to charge everything normally too. I actually had the same thought as the guy above. I'm not buying anything that's not usb c any more. It's not future proof and i rarely have to carry a non c cable anymore (except on a trip i bring an extra micro usb for my gf s7). T4rd So your mouse and keyboard.. that's pretty much it. I agree, I would only like to buy USB C accessories as well, but it seems they're not picking it up any time soon still. catalysto So you're being purposefully obtuse. T4rd Likewise. catalysto That's a yes. T4rd For you. DanSan https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5e55bc06067cf74753d28062e8aaf21244bf97f17ad555a1d4b58976f73be2bf.gif catalysto Interesting angle you took there. T4rd You trying to be (a)cute? =p Charles https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/04c3103885fe90c9fac6a716024d3ffabaa2c2d1637efd9143fe07e90fbe15f3.jpg matteventu Which USB-C mouse have you got? I was looking for one to replace my MAX Anywhere 2. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Lol. This is ridiculously ugly T4rd Headphones with Cast built in..? Could be cool. marcusmarcus2 That is the first thing I thought when I read the headline makapav That would be a pretty good idea - as long as it also has a mic for calls and gives the option for filtering in ambient sound/noise when needed. Rinkesh621 How about cast and miniature Google home, so you can order pizza, while you stream your music from your Spotify while you watch e-sport games with Picture in Picture of watching old Charlie Chaplin silent film? No.... just a though. lol SpeakethTheTruth Sounds like a Pimp My Ride episode. Lateef Alabi-Oki 600mAh battery for a headphone? What are they aiming for? A week long battery life. Jay I'd probably buy them because Google. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ 4Ui812 They'll probably have issues out of the box because .... Google ¯_(ツ)_/ Mohamed Fixaal And they'll later release 10 new headphones and change their names later in because Google.. ¯_(ツ)_/ David’s Flattop Reigns Supreme Wow, Its a trifecta of wisdom!! Diego Opazo SV-Cross ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ After that they'll release a companion app ecosystem only to abandon them altogether because ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Ray And then one model will shut down randomly with 35% battery still remaining. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ David’s Flattop Reigns Supreme even more helpful.... Nexus✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Guess I've gotten mostly lucky, my two galaxy nexus, nexus 4, 5, 7, google home, chromecasts, nexus player, and pixel didn't have problems out of the box. my 5x developed crazy slowness over time rendering it barely useful (and I've flashed all sorts of roms and formatted storage and disabled encryption). Nigel Antonio im right there with you, but ad a nexus 1. and a Pixel to the mix. Dennis Lockhart Maybe but they'll be in 'beta' so a fix is just down the road a bit. ;-) 4Ui812 LOL Andrey Simakov They are Google because Google. David’s Flattop Reigns Supreme Well that was helpfull Glen Barrington Then they'll abandon the whole thing because Google.. ¯_(ツ)_/ John Marshall’s Ghost Why isn't this USB C? I have a Pixel XL and my wife has the Nexus 5X. We have switched our lives over to USB C. Why would I want to carry around another cable or an adapter just for a set of headphones? I have not been able to find a set of USB C wireless headphones and for the life of me, I can't understand why. vmxr ugly Cael That G looks like a Q to mean. Clearly the Nexus Q2 /s Thomas Larsen It's a power button Cael I was being sarcastic... Thomas Larsen I know, even without the /s makiller The manual showing an aux cable included reinforces for me that Google will keep the headphone jack on the next Pixel again. I doubt they'd include an aux cord with their new branded headphones if their new branded phone couldn't even use it..... right? These are kind of ugly though. ITGuy11 Right. Cause your going to need that headphone jack due to Pixel 2 Bluetooth issues ¯_(ツ)_/¯ JG Counter point... That assumes everyone at Google will be using the Pixel 2. I would imagine some (especially those developing for iOS) use iPhones. And several probably carry around Galaxy devices etc... You don't have to eat McDonalds for every meal just because you work there... You're also further assuming the aux cord is to be plugged into the phone. Maybe the aux port is included so the headphones can connect to the employee's computer terminal. Or maybe the equipment in the campus gym, like at my gym, lack bluetooth and need a wired connection in order to listen to the built in TV/music player. Or since Google will only need a small quantity I would imagine it would probably have been easier and cheaper just to use parts already in production rather than asking whoever is actually building them to create custom hardware for a relatively small order. That would also explain why the charge port is microUSB and not USB-C. DanSan just curious, is there a reason why you'd expect a microphone for these? I'm just guessing here but these don't look like gaming or professional use headphones which would be the only time they might require a mic. This looks more like trying to capture the hype of other products like beats. No idea but do beats have a built in mic? I get it, maybe it would be good for assistant if it had a mic but not sure i see lack of microphone a drawback, especially when similar headphones dont have them matteventu For... Calls? DanSan do other headphones that look or fit in this same category have the same functionality? i only ask because the article is written as if not having a mic is a knock against the product yet i dont think anything else in this space has a mic. Miku is Best Vocaloid Most of them do. matteventu Aurevoir 3.5mm jack on Pixel 2. Damnit. Fr0gg0 It's not like anyone outside Google would want to wear those. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Never underestimate the power of branding. sebastianer Yeah....for less than 150€ you can get some AKG K701s headphones.(that you can mod if you need more Low frequency). And for 100 USD you can get a Schiit Fulla 2 amazing DAC and reasonable good amp. That's all you need for a decent audio quality nowadays. Tom Harman Yes Please! Jeffrey Spiers I'll be scouring Ebay for these... icyhotmike Supported for 3 months and then left dry to die a slow and unfixed death -Every Google product KRS_Won Google Listen™ Built with Cast® I'd prob buy em. Rinkesh621 Those earmuff bezels tho ! Complimentary with Pixel 2? Alfonso Surroca It's a shame this headset is internal-only. A Google headset such as this would fit nicely with their consumer product mix, especially if it only worked in conjunction with all-new dedicated messaging and voice apps. G Suite Headset Messenger by Google has a nice ring to it. Rod Moore What is this AUX you speak of? All of Goggles phones have USB-C ports. Plus the Chromebooks are coming out with USB-C. Very odd to be using a older USB auxiliary port. hzd Bluetooth Google headphones . . . Haha expect less work to get done at Google from here on in, Google's relationship with any BT is always Rocky !

(Cory Morse | MLive.com) Print Email Brandon Champion | bchampio@mlive.com By Brandon Champion | bchampio@mlive.com The Grand Rapids Press Follow on Twitter on April 26, 2017 at 1:19 PM, updated April 26, 2017 at 1:26 PM comments GRAND RAPIDS, MI - Saturday, May 6 is World Naked Gardening Day. Yes, that's a thing. Even more surprising is that two sets of Michigan cities are apparently among the 10 areas in the United States that are most into the idea.  According to a two-month LawnStarter review of Google Trends from March 15 to May 15, 2016, the Grand Rapids-Kalamazoo-Battle Creek region is the No. 7 area for interest in the obscure holiday. The region received a Google Trend score of 57, just behind Flint-Saginaw-Bay City, which had a Google Trend score of 61. Eugene, Ore. Is the No. 1 location of interest for "World Naked Gardening Day." Other areas on the list include Buffalo, N.Y., Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, Pa., Little-Rock-Pine-Bluff, Ark., Burlington. Vt.-Plattsburgh, N.Y., Roanoke-Lynchburg, Va., Spokane, Wash. and Knoxville, Tenn. World Naked Gardening Day has been around longer than you may think. Participants are encouraged "to tend to their portion of the world's garden unclothed as nature intended." According to the LawnStarter report, the American Association for Nude Recreation declared in 2016 that aside from promoting body acceptance and personal freedom, "nude gardening is comfortable, saves on laundry and makes for a quick personal cleanup -- just hose down or shower off." There's no actual word on whether or not these Michigan communities will actually have a large contingent of participants.

We didn’t know that Google had such an audio device in the works, but the filing doesn’t really hold anything back. In fact, we have full photos, a user manual, etc.  The device is listed under FCC ID A4R-S0012B30GGU0H and with a model number of GID5B. A4R is Google’s FCC code, by the way, so these are indeed a Google product. Those IDs don’t tells us a ton, but we do know that these headphones have a 500mAh battery inside, ANC Button, track and volume buttons, and 3.5mm port. They also feature a microUSB port for charging, which is something. Umm, microUSB, really? In my opinion, these headphones are also one of the ugliest pairs I’ve seen in some time. Each can is a different shade of black or grey, plus we have unnecessary Google circle logos surrounding power icons on both. Tough to say if these are coming soon or if Google is just messing around and creating hardware to keep the FCC on their toes. Maybe we’ll know at I/O in a couple of weeks?

I’m not an audiophile anymore. Less wires and more convenience with adequate sound is good enough for me. moew Snap, Crackle and Pop love you for buying their cereal, and not complaining. I think there’s buzz, flockkkzzzzzz, and overall click clicks, too. Gotta LOVE bluetooth audio for lemmings.

You may be seeing the reflection off of each can differently… trevorsalienarms The best feature is the filtering that only allows the wearer to hear content Google has approved.

Synacks Gingerbread trevorsalienarms Honeycomb Suicide_Note Froyo! moew Everyone is wrong, Donut or Eclair. Suicide_Note Android Police was speculating that this was less about the headphones, and more about the radio contained within getting through the FCC. In other words, a bit of trickery and deception on Google’s part. If they’re wrong, however, goddamn those are some ugly headphones. hfoster52 You would think they would have wiped off the powered sugar off the right ear on that one picture before taking it. Suicide_Note Yep. Definitely powdered sugar. https://m.popkey.co/96b7cb/Yo3E_f-maxage-0.gif Xious I seriously doubt these are something that Google is going to be releasing. The button design seems very outdated as well.

The oddities, in the decay of short-lived particles called B mesons, were announced on 18 April by the LHCb experiment at CERN, Europe’s particle-physics lab near Geneva, Switzerland. So far, the statistical significance of the results is below 2.5 sigma, falling short of the 5-sigma threshold usually needed to claim a ‘discovery’. It could fade as more data are analysed. However, the anomalies chime with previously reported peculiarities, and match predictions that some theorists had made on the basis of those reports. CERN Detector elements of the LHCb experiment. Google health study Google’s life-sciences spin-off, Verily, launched an in-depth health study of 10,000 people on 19 April. Project Baseline, in development since 2014, will track participants’ health for at least four years, to identify risk factors for developing disease. Data will be collected from wearable sensors, smartphones and regular clinic visits. The firm, in South San Francisco, California, is running the study with researchers at Stanford University in California and Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. US malaria cases Malaria cases have been rising in the United States since the 1970s and could be more common than realized, according to a study published on 24 April (D. Khuu et al. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. http://doi.org/b597; 2017). Between 2000 and 2014, 22,029 people were treated in hospital for the disease, the study found — more than was estimated by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; treatment costs came to US$555 million. Transmission of malaria in the United States was wiped out in the 1950s, and the rise in cases probably results from an increase in visits to malaria-endemic areas, the authors say. They also highlight an apparent trend among travellers of avoiding preventive medications and measures. EVENTS March for Science Tens of thousands of people turned out across the globe for the March for Science on 22 April, probably the largest-ever demonstration in support of scientific research and evidence-based policymaking. The main demonstration took place in Washington DC, with protests in at least 600 cities around the world. The march was organized shortly after the inauguration of US President Donald Trump in January, largely in response to widespread alarm about his administration’s attitude towards science. Green bank sold The UK government’s Green Investment Bank has been offloaded to Macquarie, a finance firm based in Sydney, Australia, for £2.3 billion (US$2.9 billion), ending a controversial sale process. The bank was set up to fund clean-power projects and energy-efficiency schemes, and at the time of sale was Europe’s largest green-energy investor. The sale had been expected for months and had been plagued by criticism; some fear the privatization could set back investment in green technologies. PUBLISHING Fake peer review Academic publisher Springer said on 20 April that it is retracting 107 papers from its journal Tumor Biology after finding that they had been accepted on the basis of fabricated peer-review reports. The problem has affected publishers including Springer before: investigations in 2015 and 2016 into irregularities in Springer’s peer-review process led to 122 retractions in various journals, including Tumor Biology. The latest papers were identified through extra screening processes put in place after those investigations. Springer stopped publishing the journal at the end of 2016; it is now published by Sage Publishing in Thousand Oaks, California. The latest retractions, all of papers by Chinese authors, have led to soul-searching in China. The state-run People’s Daily newspaper blamed a lack of serious punishment for academic misconduct and pressure on overworked clinicians to publish. (Springer is part of Springer Nature, which also publishes Nature.) SPACE China space station China has for the first time resupplied a space station in orbit. A Tianzhou 1 cargo module automatically docked with the Tiangong 2 station on 22 April; the operation will be repeated several times to test different procedures, according to the China Manned Space Agency. Tiangong 2 was launched last September without a crew, with the aim of developing technology and expertise for a permanent space station that China plans to start assembling early next decade. Two astronauts were sent on board a month later for a one-month stay; the craft also carries multiple science experiments. Tianzhou 1 weighs in at 13.5 tonnes, 6 tonnes of which are supplies, making it heavier than the 8.6‑tonne Tiangong 2.  Spaceport accord Europe’s main spaceport, the Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana, has resumed operations following a month-long shutdown during widespread social unrest over living and working conditions in the overseas territory. An agreement reached on 21 April with the French government will bring some €2.1 billion (US$2.3 billion) in aid to French Guiana. The space centre, near the town of Kourou, had been caught up in the protests, with its roads blocked and three commercial launches delayed. The spaceport is also the location for research satellite launches, including the James Webb Space Telescope planned for next year. Jody Amiet/AFP/Getty Kourou’s mayor François Ringuet speaks to the crowd after leaving the rocket-launching space centre (Centre Spatial Guyanais CSG) that he occupied with other protest leaders, on 5 April, in Kourou. Atmosphere study A fleet of 28 atmosphere-studying ‘CubeSats’, including Australia’s first three research satellites since 2002, soared into space from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on 19 April. The miniature satellites are part of the QB50 international mission to study Earth’s lower thermosphere. This poorly studied part of the atmosphere, at between 200 and 380 kilometres altitude, is where cosmic radiation can affect space weather and satellite communications. When released from the International Space Station next month, the CubeSats will provide the first detailed 3D glimpse into these processes. FUNDING Geoengineering The United Kingdom unveiled an £8.6-million (US$11 million) programme of research into geoengineering — the science of altering the planet’s systems to counter global warming — on 20 April. The Greenhouse Gas Removal Research Programme will fund around 100 researchers working on projects that range from combining tree planting with farming in agroforestry schemes to using weathering of mining slag to absorb carbon dioxide from the air. The government-funded scheme could eventually help Britain to meet its commitment under the 2015 Paris climate agreement to try to limit global warming to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels. FACILITIES Drug regulator’s fate Senior figures from the world’s leading pharmaceutical companies have warned of dire consequences for the European Union if the future of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) — currently based in London — is not swiftly resolved. The agency is almost certain to move from London when the United Kingdom leaves the EU, but no formal decision has been made on a new home. Presidents and vice-presidents of companies including GSK, Merck, Sanofi and Novartis said in an open letter on 24 April that a decision on the EMA’s new location should be taken as soon as possible — preferably in June. Otherwise, crucial work on approving new medicines and monitoring drug safety may be disrupted, they say. POLICY Weather research The US Congress has passed its first major legislation involving weather research in more than two decades. Among other things, the law instructs the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to focus on forecasting high-impact weather events such as strong, damaging storms, and to improve its temperature and precipitation forecasts on the timescale of two weeks to two years. The bill also authorizes the agency to continue developing the use of commercial satellite data. President Donald Trump signed the bill into law on 18 April. TREND WATCH The quest to wipe out Guinea worm is heading in the right direction again. The parasite is left in just four African countries, but an epidemic in dogs in Chad that emerged in 2012 threatened eradication efforts. The Carter Center in Atlanta, Georgia, which is leading the global eradication campaign, reports that dog infections are down by 37% in the first three months of this year compared with the same period last year. It credits better health education and the tethering of infected dogs.

[Update: Just headphones for employees] Google-branded wireless headphones show up at the FCC Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/26 10:28am PDTApr 26, 2017 82 Plus 1 on G+ 136 Share on Facebook 111 Share on Twitter Total Shares329 Google News Update 1: 2017/04/26 10:30am PDT An anonymous tipster has shed some light on what these almost certainly are. Google issues headphones to a large number of its employees, and the current model is getting quite Well this is... unexpected. We've heard whispers of a new Google Home/Google WiFi combo, and even the next Pixel devices, but nothing in the realm of audio products. Out of nowhere, a set of headphones from Google have appeared in a new FCC filing. The headphones, which are identified as 'GID5B,' are definitely a bit odd. One side has a power button, and the other a simple Google logo, both in a circle matching Google's logo colors. According to the documents, these headphones support Bluetooth connectivity - but there doesn't appear to be any mention of a microphone. As with many wireless headphones, there is an AUX connector if you don't want to mess with Bluetooth. Strangely, there is a microUSB port for charging - not USB Type-C. According to the user manual included in the FCC filing, GID5B has a 600mAh battery. It's very possible that this was filed to get clearance on the internal radio, which could later be included on a different pair of headphones. The microUSB port, lack of microphone functionality, and no Google Assistant features seems to back up this claim. It would be a bit strange for Google to release headphones without any unique functionality, using an old port. Update 1: 2017/04/26 10:30am PDT An anonymous tipster has shed some light on what these almost certainly are. Google issues headphones to a large number of its employees, and the current model is getting quite long in the tooth. We've got a picture of it below. As you can see, it bears the same power button iconography as the ones in the FCC filing above. These headphones are distributed for use only inside Google and are not sold anywhere - they're just for Googlers. This new ANC Bluetooth version is just an update on the design, probably meant to replace these older headsets as they're phased out. So, no: Google is not releasing a really ugly wireless headphone with a microUSB port and no microphone. Well, not to anyone except Googlers.

Not Google's... #facepalm FRGuzman That's actually Google's official merchandise store. Admittedly, it does look fake. It's run by a third party company that has the license to produce merchandise with G's logo, though. MJ How do we know this? Source? Why would Google use like a 3rd rate company for this? Anyone have a link from Google's website to that site? Gobelet The SSL certificate was delivered by Google themselves. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2ec49ef6e0020e3a0c8436a7f6610146bd0e573f443b2d220fc2a5baf5ed48be.png MJ Well played sir... Best proof after a half dozen comments. Again, why have a third rate looking store site that looks like crap/fake? FRGuzman I did some research on it a couple of months ago as I was looking for a Google decal and stumbled upon this website and it looked kinda shady to me too. I can't recall all the evidence I gathered but I ended up convinced it was legit. I'd say Google doesn't care too much about branded merchandising and they off loaded it to a third party company that in my opinion doesn't even offer compeling or quality looking goods. Shagnscooby Weird. I knew they had a merch store but I certainly didn't think there was electronics there that weren't on the store.google.com They must not make or design the merch ones and it's just a logo slapped on. MJ They don't... It's a fake store. Shagnscooby It's not fake. I've done telephone survey's for Google and one of the payment options was a Google Merch store gift card instead of other gift cards. MJ Google does telephone surveys? Who even answers telephone surveys or picks up on unrecognized numbers? mog386 Wrong. It's legit. Lol. You dolt. "About Robertson Marketing Robertson is Google’s branded merchandise partner in North America.

MJ Really? You had go with the name calling? I don't care what the fucking website says... It doesn't look legit at all. Even if they have the rights to slap the Google logo on shit they aren't Google's products. The OP was wrong about the headphones. Aaron Berlin I'm guessing those are just white label goods with Google branding on them, so GOOG wouldn't actually file with the FCC. Maybe??? MJ It's not official merchandise! It's fake! mog386 Wrong. It's legit. Lol. "About Robertson Marketing Robertson is Google’s branded merchandise partner in North America.

David Ruddock I'm sorry, but not even close. MJ LOL I beat you to it David. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I mean they are both headphones... Dan Proctor Mentioned it above but my comment was aimed at these going into their merchandise store vs a real consumer product. My company offers the same generic branded things that go through the FCC as our own products. Very common among the bigger companies of the world. David Ruddock They could, but seeing as we've never seen any headphones go through under Google's name before, I have my doubts. Dan Proctor As in these look like they will be going into this store. Same as other people have said about them being the generic items Google offers at events and to employees. David Mendívil if this thing has an internal FM radio receiver (analog), I will get one Sashank Narayan What mainstream headphones even have that capability? Justin W I can answer this: none. Marc Seiler ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And why? FM radio still exists? David Mendívil dude, not everyone lives in EEUU or EUROPE, most of the human population still hears analogical radio stations Matt It's not just a Europe thing. I live in the US and I have not listened to FM radio in years. Erstam Same. I despise analog radio. Do many commercials plus it usually sounds like crap. DanSan I don't even know where the FM radio button is in my car. /s yes i do but you get the point. David Mendívil Sorry EEUU is USA in Spanish hehe but at least in south america, it is quite common to still have the good old FM radio stations, having a data plan is still too expensive Matt Oh, right. I even know that. I think having it right next to EUROPE my brain just combined it all. podme Probably giveaways to employees and swag for events, etc Jarrett Lennon Kaufman They'd be better off rebranding OEM headphones for just that, though, and could skip this process. Mordalo I'm more concerned about the sound quality. If they sound good and don't break my bank account (or my mortgage payment), I'd be happy to get another set of good Bluetooth cans. They don't need to be always on or listening (even though this is Google). mlm5em Sees Headline: Must buy immediately Sees Mirco USB: Run away T4rd What wireless headphones (or any phone/PC accessories) have USB-C ports yet? Erstam My phone is usb c. My Chromebook only had usb c. I have a mouse and keyboard that are usb c. My battery pack is usb c. Come to the future brother. It's great!. I use the same cable to charge everything normally too. I actually had the same thought as the guy above. I'm not buying anything that's not usb c any more. It's not future proof and i rarely have to carry a non c cable anymore (except on a trip i bring an extra micro usb for my gf s7). T4rd So your mouse and keyboard.. that's pretty much it. I agree, I would only like to buy USB C accessories as well, but it seems they're not picking it up any time soon still. catalysto So you're being purposefully obtuse. T4rd Likewise. catalysto That's a yes. T4rd For you. DanSan https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5e55bc06067cf74753d28062e8aaf21244bf97f17ad555a1d4b58976f73be2bf.gif catalysto Interesting angle you took there. T4rd You trying to be (a)cute? =p Charles https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/04c3103885fe90c9fac6a716024d3ffabaa2c2d1637efd9143fe07e90fbe15f3.jpg matteventu Which USB-C mouse have you got? I was looking for one to replace my MAX Anywhere 2. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Lol. This is ridiculously ugly T4rd Headphones with Cast built in..? Could be cool. marcusmarcus2 That is the first thing I thought when I read the headline makapav That would be a pretty good idea - as long as it also has a mic for calls and gives the option for filtering in ambient sound/noise when needed. Rinkesh621 How about cast and miniature Google home, so you can order pizza, while you stream your music from your Spotify while you watch e-sport games with Picture in Picture of watching old Charlie Chaplin silent film? No.... just a though. lol SpeakethTheTruth Sounds like a Pimp My Ride episode. Lateef Alabi-Oki 600mAh battery for a headphone? What are they aiming for? A week long battery life. Jay I'd probably buy them because Google. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ 4Ui812 They'll probably have issues out of the box because .... Google ¯_(ツ)_/ Mohamed Fixaal And they'll later release 10 new headphones and change their names later in because Google.. ¯_(ツ)_/ David’s Flattop Reigns Supreme Wow, Its a trifecta of wisdom!! Diego Opazo SV-Cross ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ After that they'll release a companion app ecosystem only to abandon them altogether because ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Ray And then one model will shut down randomly with 35% battery still remaining. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ David’s Flattop Reigns Supreme even more helpful.... Nexus✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Guess I've gotten mostly lucky, my two galaxy nexus, nexus 4, 5, 7, google home, chromecasts, nexus player, and pixel didn't have problems out of the box. my 5x developed crazy slowness over time rendering it barely useful (and I've flashed all sorts of roms and formatted storage and disabled encryption). Nigel Antonio im right there with you, but ad a nexus 1. and a Pixel to the mix. Dennis Lockhart Maybe but they'll be in 'beta' so a fix is just down the road a bit. ;-) 4Ui812 LOL Andrey Simakov They are Google because Google. David’s Flattop Reigns Supreme Well that was helpfull Glen Barrington Then they'll abandon the whole thing because Google.. ¯_(ツ)_/ John Marshall’s Ghost Why isn't this USB C? I have a Pixel XL and my wife has the Nexus 5X. We have switched our lives over to USB C. Why would I want to carry around another cable or an adapter just for a set of headphones? I have not been able to find a set of USB C wireless headphones and for the life of me, I can't understand why. vmxr ugly Cael That G looks like a Q to mean. Clearly the Nexus Q2 /s Thomas Larsen It's a power button Cael I was being sarcastic... Thomas Larsen I know, even without the /s makiller The manual showing an aux cable included reinforces for me that Google will keep the headphone jack on the next Pixel again. I doubt they'd include an aux cord with their new branded headphones if their new branded phone couldn't even use it..... right? These are kind of ugly though. ITGuy11 Right. Cause your going to need that headphone jack due to Pixel 2 Bluetooth issues ¯_(ツ)_/¯ JG Counter point... That assumes everyone at Google will be using the Pixel 2. I would imagine some (especially those developing for iOS) use iPhones. And several probably carry around Galaxy devices etc... You don't have to eat McDonalds for every meal just because you work there... You're also further assuming the aux cord is to be plugged into the phone. Maybe the aux port is included so the headphones can connect to the employee's computer terminal. Or maybe the equipment in the campus gym, like at my gym, lack bluetooth and need a wired connection in order to listen to the built in TV/music player. Or since Google will only need a small quantity I would imagine it would probably have been easier and cheaper just to use parts already in production rather than asking whoever is actually building them to create custom hardware for a relatively small order. That would also explain why the charge port is microUSB and not USB-C. DanSan just curious, is there a reason why you'd expect a microphone for these? I'm just guessing here but these don't look like gaming or professional use headphones which would be the only time they might require a mic. This looks more like trying to capture the hype of other products like beats. No idea but do beats have a built in mic? I get it, maybe it would be good for assistant if it had a mic but not sure i see lack of microphone a drawback, especially when similar headphones dont have them matteventu For... Calls? DanSan do other headphones that look or fit in this same category have the same functionality? i only ask because the article is written as if not having a mic is a knock against the product yet i dont think anything else in this space has a mic. Miku is Best Vocaloid Most of them do. matteventu Aurevoir 3.5mm jack on Pixel 2. Damnit. Fr0gg0 It's not like anyone outside Google would want to wear those. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Never underestimate the power of branding. sebastianer Yeah....for less than 150€ you can get some AKG K701s headphones.(that you can mod if you need more Low frequency). And for 100 USD you can get a Schiit Fulla 2 amazing DAC and reasonable good amp. That's all you need for a decent audio quality nowadays. Tom Harman Yes Please! Jeffrey Spiers I'll be scouring Ebay for these... icyhotmike Supported for 3 months and then left dry to die a slow and unfixed death -Every Google product KRS_Won Google Listen™ Built with Cast® I'd prob buy em. Rinkesh621 Those earmuff bezels tho ! Complimentary with Pixel 2? Alfonso Surroca It's a shame this headset is internal-only. A Google headset such as this would fit nicely with their consumer product mix, especially if it only worked in conjunction with all-new dedicated messaging and voice apps. G Suite Headset Messenger by Google has a nice ring to it. Rod Moore What is this AUX you speak of? All of Goggles phones have USB-C ports. Plus the Chromebooks are coming out with USB-C. Very odd to be using a older USB auxiliary port. hzd Bluetooth Google headphones . . . Haha expect less work to get done at Google from here on in, Google's relationship with any BT is always Rocky !

A name like Samsung needs no introduction. As the market leader in smartphones overall, Samsung annually has a lot to live up to. The last two years of Samsung smartphones have seen significant innovation in key areas that are important to consumers, and this year Samsung is focusing on the thing we use most all day on our phones: the screen. Already known for having the absolute best screens in the industry, this generation of phones is all about body to screen aspect ratio, with Samsung pushing the highest ratio we’ve ever seen from the company, and in fact some of the higher ratios we’ve seen from any company. There’s also the removal of the physical home button to think about, a brand new AI assistant called Bixby, as well as a number of other features and design choice evolution as well. Is this the ultimate smartphone? Let’s find out. Specs This year Samsung is launching two models of the Galaxy S8, whose only differences are physical and screen sizes. The Galaxy S8 sports a 5.8-inch display, and body dimensions of 148.9mm tall, 68.1mm wide and 8mm thin, weighing in at 155 grams. The Galaxy S8+ (Plus) features a 6.2-inch display, and body dimensions of 159.5mm tall, 73.4mm wide and 8.1mm thin, weighing in at 173 grams. Both models feature the same edge-to-edge dual-curved Super AMOLED display with 18.5:9 aspect ratio and WQHD+ resolution (2960×1440), covered in Gorilla Glass 5. The Galaxy S8 retails for $750/£689/€700, while the Galaxy S8+ retails for $850/£779/€800. As usual with a big launch you’ll find plenty of retailers selling it for less or giving other bundles away to sweeten the deal, and the choice of colors ranges from Orchid Gray, Arctic Silver and Midnight Black. The Galaxy S8 is the first phone to market with the Snapdragon 835 System-on-a-Chip (SoC) and the Exynos 8895 SoC, depending on market. Both chipsets are Octa-core processors; the international Galaxy S8 family features the Exynos 8895, which is made up of a quad-core 2.3 GHz and a quad-core 1.7 GHz processor and a Mali-G71 MP20 GPU. The US model features the Snapdragon 835, which is made up of a quad-core 2.35 GHz (Kryo core) and a quad-core 1.9 GHz (Kryo core) processor and an Adreno 540 GPU. Both versions feature 4GB of RAM, while Samsung is also making a special edition of the phone in various countries with 6GB of RAM. The main configuration of the phone includes 64GB of internal storage with microSD card support, and a 128GB version of the phone is also sold. The Galaxy S8 sports a non-removable 3,000mAh battery, while the S8+ features a larger 3,500mAh battery. Qi and PMA wireless charging are available on most models of the phone, and a USB Type-C port with USB 3.1 speeds is available as well as a 3.5mm audio jack too. An 8-megapixel camera with f/1.7 lens sits on the front, while a 12-megapixel camera with 1/2.5″ sensor size, 1.4-micron size pixels, f/1.7 lens, dual-pixel PDAF, OIS and single-LED flash sits on the back. An iris scanner sits on the front, while the bevy of sensors on the back includes a fingerprint scanner, barometer, heart rate and an SpO2 sensor.  In The Box Samsung is including quite a bundle for the price here, and considering the price of some previous generation Samsung flagships, this really is quite a deal. Underneath the phone you’ll find a USB Type-C charger with a Samsung Adaptable Fast Charger, as well as a converter for microUSB to USB Type-C to use existing plugs and peripherals. In addition to this you’ll find a USB Type-C OTG connector for connecting flash drives and other USB media to the phone like you would on a computer, and of course the requisite manuals, guides and SIM tray ejector tool. As an added bonus with their partnership with AKG, Samsung is including a pair of wired headphones (3.5mm jack) that normally retail for $99. Many carriers have been doing deals to include the new Gear VR with controller or microSD card bundles too, so be on the lookout for those extras. Display Easily the biggest and likely best new feature of the Galaxy S8 over predecessors is the brand new display Samsung has outfitted both sized devices with. Dubbed the Infinity Display, Samsung is creating a brand for its edge displays that goes beyond mere shape, and attempts to transcend what we have thought of when it comes to seeing the information on screen. Taking up most of the face of the phone is only the beginning, as Samsung has tweaked the curved edges of the glass to provide less distortion than previous generations, all while making the glass stronger and easier to use. Samsung has focused on a few key points with the Galaxy S8 and is building upon that which has made their displays so incredible over the last few years: always-on technology, great outdoor visibility, amazing color reproduction with HDR support, and size to body ratio. Starting with the size of the screen, we’re looking at the largest screens ever to grace any Samsung flagship phone, yet body sizes that are nearly identical to last year’s devices. The Galaxy S8 features a 5.8-inch screen that resides on a body nearly the same size as the Galaxy S7, while the Galaxy S8+ features a 6.2-inch screen that resides on essentially the same body size as last year’s Galaxy S7 Edge. It’s an incredible feat of engineering, and it produces a phone that’s both striking to behold and one that provides significant advantage in real world use. Larger screens are inherently better, so long as they don’t infringe on usability, and Samsung has captured both elements in these phones. Much like the Galaxy Note 7, the curves on the left and right edges of the screen are much less pronounced than we saw with previous Edge branded devices, and in general they make the phone easier to use and hold. Also like the Note 7 you’ll find the “edge” features to feel less like features meant for a side-mounted screen and more like features who are simply easier to call up thanks to the swooping edge.  By default there’s an ever present “tab” of sorts on the right side of the screen, and swiping inward on this tab from any app will bring up Samsung’s Edge Panels. Out of the box there are nearly 20 Edge Panels to choose from, all of which provide tons of extra functionality out of the box without needing to navigate away from the active app. Panels feature functionality like viewing your calendar, reminders, stock ticker, news, weather and lots of other information. Other Edge Panels work like extra quick toggles or shortcuts, providing ways of quickly calling your 10 favorite contacts, quickly accessing your 10 most used apps, giving quick access to what’s on your phone’s copy/paste clipboard, and even multiple ways of clipping sections of the screen to share with other people. Samsung even has tons of other edge panels that can be downloaded too; things like a quick way to read messages, switch between music radio stations, a calculator and more. The options are seemingly limitless. Samsung’s Always On display from last year has made a return as well, and it’s better than ever both feature wise and functionally. As we saw last year, users can choose between many different types of information to be displayed when the screen is “off.” Things like the calendar, time and even a photo can be on the screen at all times, effectively draining almost no battery thanks to the AMOLED technology that allows individual pixels to be lit up at a time. Samsung has further improved the always-on display by giving users more customization, including the ability to use backgrounds, change the color of text and even move the always-on element to different sections of the screen. New to the always-on display is the software home button, which can be permanently displayed at all times and gives an easy way to wake the phone up by hard pressing it, as well as Infinity Display backgrounds to give movement and a little extra visual punch to the presentation. As far as the panel quality itself is concerned, this is absolutely the best panel we’ve ever seen from Samsung. A WQHD+ Super AMOLED display powers the visual feast on both phones, and naturally the smaller Galaxy S8 will have a higher pixel-per-inch density, which will help make VR content sharper. White balance out of the box is nearly perfect, with the panel skewing just a tad on the cool side if anything. Color representation out of the box is a little over saturated and vibrant, and the contrast is a little high for videos, but changing from Adaptive Display to AMOLED Cinema or Basic modes make the colors more accurate, the white balance warmer, and an overall more accurate color range. Samsung is supporting HDR10 technology with this phone, choosing that over the other Dolby Vision HDR standard that Netflix and some other programs use. HDR10 is officially supported by Amazon Prime Video, although the app had not yet been patched in time for launch. Outdoor visibility is nothing short of perfect, and the automatic brightness kicks the panel into overdrive when needed to make even direct sunlight viewing a non-issue. What’s really interesting with the resolution of the panels is that Samsung defaults the screen at a FHD+ resolution instead of the native WQHD+. This means out of the box the screen is only displaying 2220 x 1080 pixels, but in nearly every application it was nearly impossible to tell that it was running at a lower resolution. Folks that want to go full Monty can scale the resolution up to WQHD+ (2960×1440) in display options, or for additional battery savings can drop it to HD+ (1480×720). The additional pixels come from the non-standard 18.5:9 aspect ratio Samsung is using on the Galaxy S8. This wider, or taller ratio depending on how you hold it, provides dedicated space for those new software buttons, and even allows for some screen expansion in apps that officially support it. Apps made for the standard 16:9 aspect ratio of other screens can either be stretched to fit, or will have black bars in the places where they don’t fill in. A simple floating button appears when apps are launched for the first time, and an option in settings lets you individually toggle app display preferences. Thanks to the AMOLED technology the pixels that make up these black bars are completely turned off, resulting in some possible battery savings, but most importantly don’t look like an eyesore even if they are there. Hardware and Build Following in the footsteps of the excellent design language we saw on the Galaxy Note 7 last Fall, the Galaxy S8 feels like Samsung’s redemption of the design used there in nearly every way. The same symmetrical body has been used here, with curved edges to the screen and the same regions on the back of the phone. These curves provide a place that make it both easier to hold in your hand, as well as pick up from a flat surface. Since nearly the entirety of the body is made of glass, with just a small metal trim around the edges, the Galaxy S8 is nothing short of incredibly slippery in almost any climate. Having smaller top and bottom bezels means less surface area to grab when picking the phone up, so these curves really do help a lot. The construction feels as sturdy and premium as ever though, with no hollow points on the phone and no places that have any real sort of give to them when pressed. Considering the phone still sports the same IP68 water and dust resistance that last year’s Galaxy S7 family provided, it’s incredible to see the bezels and other areas around the phone, that are normally used for sealing the device, shrunk to the level they have been. One of the biggest design changes here for many users will be the substitution of software buttons for the hardware buttons Samsung has traditionally used. Software buttons have become a staple in Android since Google debuted them on the Galaxy Nexus in 2011, and it’s great to see Samsung finally pushing these on their big flagships as well. Software buttons give the ability for more customization, including theming and reorganization, but at this time there’s no real commercial ultrasonic fingerprint scanner that’s ready for mass-market adoption in smartphones. This means Samsung had to move the fingerprint scanner to the back of the phone, but instead of following the tried-and-true design language of most other Android phones with such a fingerprint placement, they placed it to the side of the camera lens. With only a small lip around the glass fingerprint scanner, it can sometimes be difficult to differentiate the scanner from the rest of the glass back, or worse yet, the camera lens. In my review time I almost never smudged the camera lens though, and even though some users have complained of this placement, I didn’t find much of an issue with Samsung’s placement here. The standard circle underneath the lens would have been better, but in practice the new placement isn’t as bad as many seem to be making it out to be. Button placements are all very similar to previous generation Samsung phones, with the power button on the right and the volume rocker on the left side of the phone. This volume rocker is a tad high though, and is uncomfortable to use while on the phone. Underneath the volume rocker is a brand new button that’s used to call up Samsung’s new Bixby AI assistant at any time, unlocked or not. On the bottom sits a centered USB Type-C port, flanked by a 3.5mm audio jack and a single speaker. Up top you’ll only find the combined SIM and microSD card tray. The new software buttons are a thing of beauty and really add to the phone’s overall unique design, giving this phone a wholly unique look and feel when compared to any other phone on the market. Many are likely concerned with the size of the phone given that the screen sizes seem so massive, but folks generally shouldn’t be. Samsung’s phones are taller, but narrower, making them easier to hold in general than previous generations. Being taller by 7mm may just make even the smallest one uncomfortable enough for one-handed use for the top-most part of the screen though, and that may just be enough to opt for even a slightly smaller phone. Having used a Pixel XL as my personal phone since launch, even the Galaxy S8+ felt like a reasonably sized phone, and it’s all thanks to the fact that this phone simply isn’t as wide as others out there. Performance and Memory Performance has often been a bit of an issue for Samsung devices in the past, and even just last year we saw performance issues in even simple daily tasks with the Galaxy Note 7. A lot of these problems stemmed from Samsung’s now defunct skin called TouchWiz, rebranded to the Samsung Experience last year when it received a major overhaul with the Android 7.0 Nougat update. While the Samsung Experience certainly began on the Galaxy S6 in a way, it finally feels complete with the Galaxy S8, and that includes performance. Daily tasks are simply blazing fast on these phones, as they should be with the powerhouse processing packages that run them. Long gone are the stutters and pauses that many associated with Samsung phones, and in are smooth transitions, beautiful animations and absolutely stellar overall design. The only thing that takes any real time to load on a regular basis is Samsung’s new Bixby AI assistant, which at times can take up to 5 seconds or more to load. It’s pretty clear Bixby still needs some work in the performance aspect, as it’s dog slow when compared to Google Assistant or the previous generation Google Now, and quite honestly feels less useful because of this slowness. Multi-tasking continues to reach new heights of greatness on the Galaxy S8, continuing the multi-window functionality that has been on Samsung phones for years, and extending to all apps on the phone thanks to the fact that the functionality is now native to Android. No longer will you find unnecessary restrictions when using multi-window, with only things like games being excluded from the usability list. Multi-window is called up either via the Overview carousel or by long-pressing the Overview button, and all the usual resizing features are available here by dragging the line that splits apps on screen. Apps can also be resized with a simple gesture; pulling down from the top corner brings almost any app into a floating window, much like a desktop OS would behave. After being pulled into window mode, apps can even be minimized to a floating icon, and then later pulled back into windowed or fullscreen mode with a single click. Gaming performance is better than ever, thanks both in part to Samsung’s excellent game-helper software, as well as the new processing power in both phones. Like last year you’ll find the game’s launcher, which keeps all your game shortcuts in one handy and easy to find location, however it also enables a number of additional features too. Samsung has reworked the shortcut buttons now since they’re using a software navigation button instead of a hardware one. This means that instead of having a floating icon on your screen at all times during gameplay, you’ll have two extra buttons on the left and right-most sides of the navigation bar at the bottom. The left button brings up the full game tools interface, which has been completely redone, and the right side is a customizable button that can either lock the screen, take a screenshot or record video. Gaming performance even at the highest possible resolution is as good as it gets, with blazing frame rates and crystal clear imagery. There’s absolutely nothing to complain about here, and Samsung offers more tools for mobile gaming than any other OEM out there by far. VR Performance Every generation of Galaxy S phone for the past few years has launched with a new Gear VR unit, and the Galaxy S8 is no exception. Last year Google launched the Daydream platform for all Android phones that can support it, and with the program came a new set of standards for mobile VR, including a motion controller that was very similar to the experience of a Nintendo Wii remote. This time around Samsung is also launching a motion controller with the new Gear VR for the Galaxy S8, one that features the same point and click functionality of the Daydream controller, but also adds in a trigger button, as well as a new ergonomic design. Samsung’s partnership with Oculus has brought boatloads of content to the Gear VR over the years, and the new Gear VR has launched with over 20 titles supporting the new motion controller. We’ll be bringing you a full review of the new Gear VR experience soon, but know that Samsung’s latest phones have some brand new features to run VR better than ever, including a new Oculus Home that’s double the resolution of previous versions. Benchmarks As can be expected from the absolute latest in mobile processing technology, the Galaxy S8 family reigns supreme at the top of the charts for benchmarks. Averaging around 25% higher performance than even just Fall 2016’s flagship processors (Snapdragon 821), the Galaxy S8’s Snapdragon 835 and Exynos 8895, depending on the region you live, will outpace anything we’ve seen so far in the mobile space. All the benchmarks below reflect this, and even then some benchmarks show considerably higher scores for certain components such as Compute graphics processing. See them all below. Wireless Connectivity With multiple versions of the phone internationally, Samsung is supporting essentially every market around the globe with the Galaxy S8. This means you may need to get a regional or carrier variant of the phone depending on where you live, however out of the box Samsung is supporting some important technologies that give it the ability to work with just about every type of wireless technology you can think of. Things like WiFi calling on supported carriers works out of the box without needing to tweak anything, and other technologies like carrier aggregation in countries that support it for download and upload speeds not normally seen with a single carrier connection. Samsung Pay support means the Galaxy S8 features both NFC wireless radios as well as MST radios for wireless magnetic strip transmission on older card readers. Possibly most important is the implementation of Bluetooth 5.0, making this the first phone to market with such a technology. Bluetooth 5.0 is a significant improvement on previous generation Bluetooth models, boasting over double the performance throughput of Bluetooth 4.0, with a wider capacity bandwidth and the ability to reach four times more space, all while being more energy efficient. Out of the box even on devices that don’t support new Bluetooth 5.0 features, the Galaxy S8 can stream music to two separate Bluetooth sources at once, meaning you can put the phone in one room and have it stream to Bluetooth speakers in two others at the same time, or use two pairs of headphones for listening to music with a friend. This new Bluetooth technology could finally outpace the need for 3.5mm jacks as the standard for audio quality, simply because it, paired with something like aptX, could really surpass the quality of what most folks’ audio systems can even output in the first place. Battery Life Battery life hasn’t been an issue with Samsung phones for some time now, and the Galaxy S8 only improves that situation further. Sporting rather large batteries for the physical phone size, both the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ feature some truly incredible battery life that’s going to easily last through a full day’s use, almost no matter what you do. Outside of the standard improvements made in Android over the past two major iterations, Samsung has added in some significant new functionality that builds upon last year’s newer battery saving methods. The Galaxy S8 will automatically identify apps that are running away with your battery and put them to sleep in the background, notifying you of the offending app’s problems and asking if further action needs to take place. You’ll also find detailed stats pertaining to battery usage of individual apps over time, and be able to more easily identify problematic ones. Remember too that, out of the box, Samsung only runs the Galaxy S8 family at FHD+ resolution rather than the full WQHD+ resolution, inherently saving battery since it won’t tax the processor as much as a higher resolution would. As has been the case with previous generation Samsung phones, the Galaxy S8 ships with an adaptive quick charger to more quickly charge your phone’s battery in a pinch. This means a 30 minute charge will get you through almost any period of time throughout the day, including a mid-morning 30-minute charge to get you all the way through the evening. In addition to that Samsung is supporting both Qi and PMA wireless standards in most markets, meaning greater compatibility with wireless charging docks and accessories no matter when and where you bought them from. This wide array of support means that, even if you only have a microUSB cable and need to use the included adapter for the USB Type-C port on the phone, you can get charged up in a jiffy. Sound Over the years we’ve seen Samsung move from custom Wolfson DACs and chipsets, which generally produce some of the best sound in the mobile space, to more generic DACs and chipsets made by Qualcomm for markets with Snapdragon chipsets. As is the case this year you’ll find the international Galaxy S8 family that’s powered by the Exynos 8895 SoC uses an in-house DSP solution, while Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 uses a new Hexagon DSP chip. While Samsung’s chips are generally more locked down than Qualcomm’s, past performance has shown that Exynos chipsets and DSPs generally outpace the Snapdragon-powered variants. This time around, however, Qualcomm has upped the game, building a new Hexagon DSP that’s capable of tapping into the extra Compute power of the SoC via the Symphony System Manager SDK. This means that applications built for ultra high quality audio will likely benefit in the future when built with this SDK in mind. All that being said both variants of the Galaxy S8 family (Snapdragon or Exynos) support 24-bit high-res audio output via the 3.5mm headset jack, Bluetooth 5.0 wireless audio with dual output support, aptX support (not aptX HD), and lots of software features like auto high-res upscaling and a great built-in equalizer. In the end though the audio output, at least on the Snapdragon model we have for review, leaves a little to be desired when compared with something like the Google Pixel. When comparing the two I found the Pixel, for instance, was able to output more punchy, dynamic sound without need for adjustment, whereas I needed to tweak my sound system to get the Galaxy S8 to sound almost as good. It’s a bit disappointing given that past Galaxy S models don’t seem to have had this issue, but it’s likely a symptom of the industry continuing to push standards higher rather than Samsung’s standards dropping a bit. Even so this phone outputs some phenomenal sound that’s likely to please most folks. Samsung stuck with a single bottom-firing external speaker once again this generation, and this was likely to help keep those top and bottom bezels small. The weakness of a single bottom firing speaker is twofold: it’s a single mono speaker, and it’s facing away from your ears. This first part can be made up for by providing quality sound that’s loud enough to hear, regardless of the situation. Samsung has definitely improved the speaker in this regard, providing one that’s significantly better than last year’s overly tinny, hollow sounding speaker. Much of this could likely be accounted for by improvements in the waterproofing technology Samsung uses to shield the phone from the elements, as waterproofing a speaker inherently blocks out some of its effectiveness. Not much can be done with the location of the speaker outside of moving it, so you’ll still need to cup it to best hear when holding the phone. Software The Samsung Experience, as Samsung now calls its heavy Android skin, has all but eclipsed stock Android in almost every way, shape and form. Feature wise this isn’t just one of the most feature rich skins on the market, but it’s also one of the most attractive, functional and intelligently designed skins as well. Just about everything here shows the drastic, sweeping changes Samsung made over the last two years, and it’s design language has improved so much you simply wouldn’t recognize this as the Samsung from just a few years ago. Gorgeous, complementary color palettes are used everywhere, with matching themes, designs and menu locations throughout every app and settings menu you’ll find. Everything from menu switches to the wording used in menus is easy to understand and find, with little to no nesting of options or settings. One of the biggest overhauls is the first thing you’ll see when starting up the phone: the home screen. For years the home launcher on Samsung phones remained almost identical, with little to no changes at all between generations. Thankfully Samsung has finally ditched its stale launcher design for a completely new one, one that not only looks worlds better than before, but also functions like a wonderful mix between the best of all launchers out there. Swiping up or down anywhere on the home screen brings up the horizontally scrolling list of apps, and swiping left and right on the home screen moves between home panes. This keeps a clear distinction between spaces and makes it less confusing for users. Long-pressing an app’s icon brings up a menu of actions that can be performed on that app, whether it be uninstalling or disabling the app right from the menu, or launching quick actions on apps that support the new Android feature. What might be most important here isn’t just the ease of finding these previously nested and hidden options, it’s the fact that these menus now appear whether you long-press an app’s icon on the home screen or in the app drawer, meaning no wondering where a certain setting was found in the past. Samsung has also created a brand new set of gorgeous live wallpapers that take wonderful advantage of that new screen, appropriately dubbed Infinity Wallpaper. These new live wallpapers apply to the home screen, lock screen and always-on screen, delivering a subtle set of motion that’s consistent across all three screen modes and beautifully wraps to the screen. Likely one of the more controversial decisions with some users is going to be the removal of the physical buttons on the front, replaced with what has become standard among most Android-powered phones now: software buttons. Instead of just following the pack here though, Samsung thought outside of the box and attempts to fulfill everyone’s requirements for buttons where they can. The new aspect ratio leaves plenty of physical room for the buttons themselves, keeping them from encroaching on the actual content located above. While the default configuration is the usual Samsung setup, where the Overview (multi-tasking) is on the left and the back button on the right, the order can finally be reversed for those of us wanting such an option. By default all software buttons will turn off when the rest of the screen turns off, however a rather handy option to keep the home button illuminated might be one of the best ways for users to get used to having software buttons.  Double tapping or hard pressing on the home button while the screen is off will wake the phone up and either unlock it if you have no lock screen security, or will prompt you for credentials (Iris, face, fingerprint, password, etc.). Something not often noticed in something as complex as a smartphone is sound design. The little clicks you hear throughout the UI, ringtones, notification sounds and even alarms can all make a huge difference in how a phone is perceived. While the stock Android sounds are good enough, they don’t give off that special feeling when looking through them for the first time, or as many users might have at this point, the thousandth. Samsung has taken great care in creating a whole new set of sounds for the Galaxy S8, ones that give off the vibe Samsung was looking for. Ringtones and alarms are soothing and peaceful, with louder ones for those who need it, and in general these are some of the better sounds we’ve heard in quite some time on a flagship phone.  All of the more annoying whistle and water drop noises from previous generations of Galaxy S phones are finally gone, replaced with more modern and friendly sounds. Folks who don’t like Samsung’s built-in sounds, icons, wallpapers and overall color scheme can turn to the theme store, which has nearly everything you can think of to theme your phone and make it truly yours. There’s plenty of free and paid options, with featured themes and elements on a daily and weekly basis. New releases come in regularly, and there are even exclusive themes and styles for the Galaxy S8 that work only with the latest version of the Samsung Experience. Most OEMs don’t go these lengths to provide themeable elements on the phone, especially ones that sell outside of China, and it’s great to see so many options available world wide. Last but certainly not least on the list of new or improved features is Samsung DeX. DeX is a new way for Samsung to extend your phone to a more traditional computing setting. Sold as a dock for your phone, DeX connects to a monitor, keyboard and mouse and allows the phone to be docked for connection to these peripherals. The interface on the monitor changes to a more PC-like appearance, with a dedicated shortcut bar at the bottom, desktop-level window management and of course full Play Store access since it’s still just your phone. Samsung’s hope with DeX is that it will play a pivotal role in helping bring smartphones to the desktop space, replacing the need for something like a Chromebook, or other light laptop or desktop computer, and allow users to keep everything they need in one device. Bixby In what feels like a repeat of history, Samsung announced a brand new voice-guided AI assistant alongside the launch of the Galaxy S8. While it’s launching on the Galaxy S8, Samsung’s intentions for Bixby go much further than just their latest flagship smartphone. In fact the Bixby that’s launching with the Galaxy S8 isn’t even a finished version. Samsung’s vision for Bixby is a grandiose one to say the least; part of the reason Samsung purchased the technology and is working to integrate it with its latest devices is all in how it works. Bixby isn’t designed the same way other virtual assistants like Google Assistant and Siri are, rather it’s designed to work inside of your apps instead of just a standalone way to search for things. In fact once the full version of Bixby launches, which is slated for later this Spring, it should be able to handle many tasks inside of supported apps, all without having to do anything with your fingers. At launch there are a good number of apps supported, and ones that will likely be important for many users too. Apps like LinkedIn, Facebook, Foursquare and Uber are all working with Bixby’s currently limited functionality, and the promise of further integration in the future is all there. At this time, however, Bixby on the Galaxy S8 is limited to two main functional parts: daily feed and visual search. Double-tapping the dedicated Bixby button on the left side of the phone brings up the Hello Bixby screen, and right now it’s incredibly slow to populate the contents of this screen. While Google Now takes mere milliseconds to appear when using the Google Launcher, Hello Bixby can take 5 or more seconds to get past the splash screen, something that likely will irritate people that are looking for instant info. Not having this process running in the background is strange, or at least freezing it and forcing it to quickly refresh when called. The Hello Bixby screen aggregates all of Bixby’s information into one pane, adding your recently taken photos, reminders, calendar entries, alarms and even a news feed into one long scrolling window. This replaces the old Flipboard interface that Samsung has had on their devices for years, and will be the hub for additional content in the future. You can edit settings here, although right now it’s pretty limited to say the least. Bixby will attempt to recognize patterns throughout the day too; things like when you wake up, when you go to sleep, get to work, school, etc. Bixby will then use these times and locations to make recommendations for what you need to do, and in time will tie in to supported services, much like Google Now does. One such service tie-in that is actually available at launch is the visual search. This is essentially a competitor for Google Goggles, a long forgotten service from Google that visually searches for things instead of requiring you to type them. Bixby Vision visual search can be called up in the camera interface by clicking the eye icon located near the shutter button. This automatically attempts to identify objects within the camera’s viewfinder and give you recommendations on what these objects are, where to read more about them and where to purchase them. Likely the biggest tie-in right now is with Pinterest, where Bixby uses Pinterest’s new visual search engine database to tap into the power of the Pinterest social media network. The idea here is to be able to take a picture of something, or use an existing picture, to visually identify objects and search for related posts. In our testing the component of Bixby Vision that worked best was image search, as Bixby was able to successfully identify a large number of objects and do an image search based on related ones. Another option is to do a shopping search based on the image taken, and this was hit or miss. Sometimes Bixby could identify the product and deliver search results for that specific one, but often it was more of products related to the brand or type of object rather than a specific one. Other times it had no idea what the product was and couldn’t deliver a result. It’s not bad, but it doesn’t feel much more advanced than the years-old Google Goggles, which can still be found on the Play Store. This isn’t exactly the rosy launch that many expected of Samsung’s hyped up AI assistant, but hopefully the soft launch of a scant few features means that Samsung is waiting for perfection before releasing them rather than having users write it off completely. Security Making its first appearance on a Samsung phone since the Galaxy Note 7 is the iris scanner, a tool that promises better security than even the fingerprint scanner on the Galaxy S8. Samsung launched its iris scanning technology on last year’s ill-fated Fall flagship phone, and while the phone was a bit of a mess, iris scanning was near perfect. Every positive aspect of the Note 7’s iris scanner is here, with more customization and features than before too. Iris scanning is based on a pair of eyes in the frame, and the phone is lightning fast to identify a user’s irises too. Long-pressing the home button to unlock the phone will immediately activate the iris scanner, if setup of course, and unlock the phone in fractions of a second. On average holding the phone about a foot away was good enough for it to positively identify me, making this unlock method a lot less awkward than you might initially think. Samsung has also integrated iris scanning into its Samsung Pay system, allowing iris scanning to be used to identify users for payments. This has to be allowed in settings, so if it makes you uncomfortable it can easily be left disabled. As was discussed before, the fingerprint scanner has been moved to the back of the phone next to the camera lens. While it seems like this placement would be incredibly awkward, it only remained strange for the first day or two until muscle memory took over. Samsung has built in a smudge detection feature in the camera software in case the lens becomes smudged by fingerprints from attempting to locate the fingerprint sensor, however I only triggered this action once in the entire review period. Difficulties in using the sensor seem to be widely overstated, although depending on hand size, some users may have issues. I found it easiest to unlock with my left hand, however I didn’t have any real issues unlocking with my right hand on a regular basis. Camera Software Samsung’s camera software has long been one of the most feature-rich and diverse pieces of camera software on the market, and the Galaxy S8’s upgraded camera software continues to push those boundaries in many ways.  Using last year’s redesigned camera interface as a base, Samsung has added even more features to the camera, including Bixby Vision for visual searches and barcode scanning. The interface will be familiar to anyone who’s ever used a smartphone before, and seems to resemble Apple’s camera interface now more than ever. A large white shutter button is centered on the bottom of the screen, flanked by dedicated record and gallery preview buttons. Swiping to the left brings up the filter’s pane, which now features more filters than ever, as well as a number of special effects, stickers and even masks. Swiping to the right brings up the mode selection screen, and additional modes above the 7 included ones are easily downloadable via the plus button at the top. Swiping up or down anywhere switches between the front and rear cameras within a second or two. This year’s camera software upgrade has made launching the software itself a tad slower. Whereas the software appeared almost instantly with last year’s Galaxy S7, this year it can take up to 4 or 5 seconds before the camera is actually ready to take a picture or record a video. This is a bit of a shame given how lightning fast Samsung got the software last year, and hopefully will be improved as we receive updates. Samsung has added an interesting new tool to help folks get better framed video from the start this time around by holding the record button down before shooting. This changes the framing to reflect what will actually be seen in video recording mode, since the sensor’s frame is cropped from a 4:3 aspect ratio of pictures to the 16:9 ratio of videos. Disappointingly there seems to be little to no advantage taken of the new taller/wider aspect ratio of the screen like LG did with the G6, instead there are now just larger bars on top and bottom when using the full resolution of the camera. Camera Performance and Results When it comes to results, Samsung’s camera experience over the years has been very hit or miss. Last year we saw some really great performance from the Galaxy S7 family, including the absolute fastest focusing times ever on any smartphone, and those positive points continue here. Launching speed of the software is worse, about on part with the Galaxy Note 7 as discussed above, and unfortunately Samsung has once again taken two steps backward in its image processing on the Galaxy S8. The Galaxy Note 7 showed significant gains in clarity and image processing as a whole cleaning up the nagging issues Samsung has had since the Note 3’s camera image processing changes. Now we’re back to square one again with the Galaxy S8, which exhibits some of the heaviest processing we’ve ever seen on any smartphone, and simply put, that’s not a good thing. Taking pictures and viewing them on the phone’s screen looks great. Balance of the shots is impeccably good, although Google does it better with the GCam and HDR+ on the Pixel line. Samsung still has a leg up on Google here with processing speed, in that HDR is done instantly and requires no background processing after the shot is taken. That speed comes at the expense of quality though, and in general you’ll find more accurate colors and better shadow detail on Google’s camera. Samsung seems to have forgotten the gains that it made in processing as a whole on the Note 7 too, as zooming into photos in good lighting conditions (read: daylight) just looks bad. In what seems to be an attempt to remove any noise in the shot, Samsung’s image processing here smudges the pixels up like a watercolor painting, removing any fine detail in the shot. This happens in every scenario with good lighting too; detail within a few feet or detail in the distance. What’s very frustrating is that the phone is wildly inconsistent with detail in general, and while some shots will turn out looking sharp and detailed, others have the overly heavy processing mucking up the waters. Objects with fine detail, like grass in a field for instance, seem to be mistaken for noise more often than not, and turn into a muddy mess. Those wanting less processing might think turning on the RAW mode would help, however photos taken in the RAW mode look quite a bit worse than in JPG mode, as it’s missing any sort of HDR capabilities and shows quite a bit of noise too. It’s a bit bizarre but it means there’s no way to fix the issues that we see during the day time, no matter what can be adjusted. On the flip side Samsung has some of the absolute best image processing we’ve ever seen in lower light, and it’s here where the Galaxy S8’s camera shines above all others that we’ve tested. The camera pulls light from seemingly invisible sources, accurately capturing colors even in very dark conditions. Zoom detail in low light is incredible too, exhibiting better detail than other phones, all while showing more in the scene as well. It’s an absolute hands down win for Samsung, and it really makes us wonder why the camera struggles so much when light is good. There’s potential here for the Galaxy S8’s camera to win the day in every scenario no matter what, but Samsung is going to have to fix the daytime processing before that happens. What continues to impress is the speed at which the camera can focus. Utilizing the same dual-pixel focusing as last year, the Galaxy S8 focuses in a matter of milliseconds, and consistently focuses on the right target the first time. It’s more accurate and faster than other phones, and it’s great to see this excellent feature return. On top of this, Samsung offers auto focus tracking by simply pressing anywhere in the frame. The phone automatically identifies objects around the area you click and follows them around as they move, giving users the ability to get the right shot every time. The front-facing camera has seen a sizable upgrade from last year’s 5-megapixel shooter on the Galaxy S7, and this year sports an 8-megapixel camera that’s great at capturing lots of detail and light. The addition of extra filters, stickers and masks really make this phone a considerably better option for selfies than last year’s models. These new masks act like those seen on Snapchat, but with some unique attributes and even animations when making faces, opening your mouth, etc. Even low light is a significant improvement upon what we saw last year, and captures more light and detail than ever before. Taking video with the front-facing camera is excellent too, and it can record up to Quad-HD quality, which is somewhere in-between 1080p and 4K. Video mode is thankfully as good as ever, recording in 4K with image stabilization. Samsung has long been one of the pioneers in ultra high quality video recording on phones, and for years has provided 4K recording options when others haven’t. In addition to stabilized 4K video, slow motion video up to 240FPS at 720p quality is available as well, and the interface for this is better than ever. The phone records at the highest slow motion quality by default, allowing users to choose the speed of the slow motion during editing afterward. It also intelligently attempts to identify elements during recording that need to be slowed down, providing an interface that allows users to easily edit the portions with simple sliding bars.

Folks who take more photos during the day, or might need a smaller phone might consider the LG G6 or Google Pixel. Those wanting the absolute latest in Android updates still need to stick with Google’s devices, or some other OEMs, as Samsung still lags behind others in that area at times. Outside of these cases, and maybe a scant few niche cases, it’s nearly impossible not to recommend the Galaxy S8 or Galaxy S8+. This is truly the cornerstone of future smartphones, and the synergy of hardware and software design we see here shows the love and care Samsung has put into every tiny little corner of the device. Simply put, if you’re in the market for a device right now, it’s almost impossible not to love what Samsung has crafted.

It takes a few steps for the boot mode vulnerability exploit to work. First, the attacker infects a PC with malware through the internet. Then, the attacker waits for the victim to enable Android Debug Bridge (ADB) after manually connecting his Nexus 6 or 6P phone to the infected PC. ADB is a command-line utility that is included with Google's Android SDK. The victim can use ADB to control his device over USB from a PC, copy files back and forth, and install and uninstall apps -- including fingerprint sensor apps. If the victim is also a developer, he can use it to load Android application packages onto his device. After the victim enables ADB, the attacker installs PC malware on the device. Then, the PC malware waits for the victim to boot up and place the device in fastboot mode to exploit an elevation of privilege vulnerability in the bootloader. This severe boot mode vulnerability allows an attacker to execute modem commands on the device. By turning on extra USB interfaces, the attacker can eavesdrop on calls, intercept data packets and get the GPS coordinates of where the calls were made. Even when the victim disables the ADB, the attacker can access a locked PC and open an ADB session with the device. This causes the ADB host to run through the victim's PC. Although the newer 6P phone had its modem diagnostics disabled in the firmware, the attacker can still seize control of the modem interfaces. The attacker can use the interfaces to send or eavesdrop on SMS messages and, possibly, to bypass two-factor authentication. The Android boot mode vulnerability was patched by Google earlier this year, so it shouldn't affect most enterprise users as long as they regularly update their devices. A second, more moderate boot mode vulnerability (CVE-2016-6678) pointed to the Motorola USBNet driver, which enabled a malicious application to allow the attacker to grab data in both Nexus phones. Google patched this moderate vulnerability in October. Ask the expert: Want to ask Judith Myerson a question about security? Submit your question now via email. (All questions are anonymous.)

The journalists made their commendation at the closing of a two-day workshop on Google tools for Journalism organised for staff of the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja in collaboration with Google. The Head of Special Projects of NAN, Malam Muhammad Tola, commended the foresight of the Managing Director, Mr Bayo Onanuga, who had resolved to improve the proficiency of journalists in their practice. Tola said the training was very impactful and beneficial, adding that it had sharpened his skills and understanding on Google tools. He noted that more than 50 per cent of the participants were impacted with the skills and believed that it would enhance their productivity and efficiency on the job. Tola, who is also the Head, Health, Gender and Population of NAN, however, called for a robust and sustainable relationship with Google. Another participant, Mr Ismail Abdullaziz, the Assistant Editor-in-Chief, Multimedia NAN, said the training was good and timely, as new crop of journalists were beginning to emerge. “What Google has done is to assist veterans who have the etiquette with tools to mentor the young crop of journalists that are emerging. “As we are experiencing a transition of the practice of old journalism into a new journalism, there is need for constant training. “I have learnt Google tools and sites on how to verify the authenticity of information on stories, pictures and videos before they can be used,’’ he said. A Desk Editor with the agency, Mr Martins Odeh, said the training has built his capacity to approach his work better. He said the training has improved his knowledge on how to tell stories with data employing statistics with the use of pie charts and graphs, among others. On her part, Miss Sadiya Hamza, Head, Foreign Desk NAN, said that the training had opened her eyes to the numerous Google tools available for journalists. “With this training I realised that I have not utilised half of what Google offers to me as a journalist. “It was really an educative and enlightening training and I commend the NAN management for organising it,’’ she said. Hamza also called on the NAN management to provide more of such trainings for the members of staff to boost their capacities as journalists. She added that the training was necessary for reporters and called for the training of all NAN journalists. Also speaking, a Senior Correspondent with the agency, Mrs Magdalene Ukuedojor, said the training was beneficial and impactful. Ukuedojor appreciated the agency for organising such a laudable programme. “The Google training was beneficial to me. I have learnt how to use Google tools to enhance my journalistic capabilities. “The training will help me immensely in my reportage, as quick steps in getting trending stories and how to verify authentic sources for stories and images from Google was taught,’’ she said. Similarly, Miss Cecilia Ologunagba, a Senior Correspondent, said that the training had enlightened her on the basic tools a data journalist required to be effective. She noted that formerly she didn’t know how to get data online and analyse it, but with the knowledge she has gained from the training, data reporting would now be easy. Ologunagba, who covers the National Bureau of Statistics, said she writes a lot of data stories and this training would help her immensely. “There is a lot to benefit from Google, like comparing trends, using the Google trends and search. “I can also save my documents and pictures online through Google drive, all these knowledge will definitely boost my reportage.’’ High light of the event included presentation of certificates to the participants.

Google App 7.1 beta is testing a search bar in the notification panel and may begin showing pollen counts [APK Teardown] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/04/26 5:12am PDTApr 26, 2017 64 Plus 1 on G+ 108 Share on Facebook 74 Share on Twitter Total Shares246 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Article Contents 1 Teardown 1.1 Search bar in the notification panel 1.2 Pollen counts 2 Download The Google app is responsible for a pretty staggering number of features ranging from the standard search interface, a voice assistant, and even a fully functional launcher. The latest update coming through the beta channel doesn't seem to have any new features going live quite yet, but there are a lot of changes to text and other resources, including the removal of all references to Bisto from the last teardown. Most of them are minor tweaks to features we've covered in the past, but a couple point to things we haven't explored yet. Users can look forward to pollen counts with their local weather and possibly a search bar located right in the notification shade. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. Search bar in the notification panel It looks like Google is testing a new location for the quick search bar. A new setting in the apk describes placing a "search bar in the notification panel." The setting doesn't appear to be live yet, even on the Android O developer preview, which isn't surprising since it's marked as a beta. Before you assume this is going to be just another quick access tile like the toggles for Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, let's be clear that the phrasing specifically says the search bar is in the notification panel and the word "tile" is never used. It could be worded incorrectly, which sometimes happens with unofficial features, but this sounds too specific to be a mistake. code <string name="search_notification_setting_title">Search bar (beta)</string> <string name="search_notification_setting_summary">Show quick search bar in the notification panel</string> <string name="accessibility_notification_google_search_button">Google Search</string> <string name="accessibility_notification_settings_button">Notification Settings</string> <string name="accessibility_notification_voice_search_button">Voice Search</string> res/xml/search_notification_preferences.xml <PreferenceScreen xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"> <SwitchPreference android:persistent="true" android:title="@string/search_notification_setting_title" android:key="persistent_search_notification_enabled" android:summary="@string/search_notification_setting_summary" android:defaultValue="false" /> </PreferenceScreen> Since the Android OS only allows very limited access to the UI of a notification, this probably won't be implemented as a regular notification. Contrary to the point I made above, it obviously still could be a simple quick tile that displays a search bar floating on top of whatever screen you're currently looking at. I'm going to venture another theory or two, although I admit this is crossing deeper into guesswork. This clue might suggest Google is planning to modify the notification panel itself to include a space for the search bar, possibly inserting it between the quick settings tiles and the actual notifications. I'm not sure many people would want a search bar in that spot, but it's not implausible. We can take that theory one step further, probably crossing into the realm of the unlikely, to raise the possibility Google could be planning to open up the notification panel to app developers even further and allow full-width widgets to be placed there. There are certain things that can't be done with either quick settings the tiles or regular notifications, so there is at least some justification for adding this capability, but it still feels unlikely. We might find out more about this as Android O gets closer to launch. Regardless of the specific implementation method, we can return to the original question of whether or not most users would want a search bar in the notification panel. Would it be redundant if there could already be a search bar on their launcher and long-pressing on the Home button can open up Assistant, or would this just give us another option if those don't fit our workflow? Since it's a beta, we may not get much more about this for a while. Pollen counts In my neck of the woods, as with the rest of the northern hemisphere, we're in the middle of Spring. That means we're enjoying warmer temperatures, sunnier skies, and longer days. For some, it's also time for unending fits of sneezing, itchy eyes, and all of the symptoms of hay fever. I don't personally suffer from this, but plenty of people do, and keeping tabs on the pollen count can be helpful for making plans to keep the allergies in check. Judging by a new image in the Google app, this information is about to get a little more visible. Titled ic_pollen_count.png, it's pretty clear what this flower image (that looks like it's sweating) will be used for. I expect it to show up with the standard weather predictions, much like it does on some other trackers and news outlets. It's a simple feature, but one that will surely be invaluable to millions of users around the world. Seeing as we're already in the middle of Spring, there's no better time for this information to go live, and probably could at any time. Hopefully it's sooner rather than later.

Filipe Santos GOOGLE, I DON'T CARE, just give me Assistant on my 6P!!! Frisi I think you should have it. Most phones have it by now. Sam I still don't have it, either :( Yash Raj Chhabra Change language to english us. Give ur phone a restart and you should have assistant. Vratislav Jindra Be glad you don't have it, Assistant sucks (at least when compared to Google Now). It can't identify songs. It broke AutoVoice (a Tasker plugin) integration. You can't type to it, you always have to speak. Long pressing home button always comes up with the assistant screen, and there is no shortcut to go to the Google App itself. I just hate it, that's all. Cody Toombs The AutoVoice plugin can kinda already be solved with IFTTT for some actions, but doesn't really give the full range of capabilities. I think that's going to get better once some of the other features for Assistant are opened up. As for speaking your input, that's already in the works. It was mentioned in a previous teardown, and I'm a bit surprised it hasn't gone live yet. (link) Tim Lewis For quickly accessing Google Now (which I use to get a quick run-down on the news), I use Action Launcher and just have a shortcut set to open the Google app when I tap the home button when I'm already on the home screen. mattcoz Yes, I hate that you can't type. I don't want to talk to my phone, especially in public. Fernando Pena I have it already... 6p, developer preview, english language. demarcmj Forgot to finish that last sentence... "Seeing as we're already in the midst of the season that could benefit from" Imparus From what? The suspens is killing me :O Cody Toombs ^ The reason I shouldn't write these on so little sleep. :) Thanks, got it fixed. I was just saying this pollen count feature could launch at any time, and probably should soon. abqnm Thanks for the teardown! Also, your sleep-writing got you again. PP 6: There are certain things that can't be done with either quick settings the titles or regular notifications... Feel free to nuke this comment after reading it. Cheers! Cody Toombs Ahh, thanks. Good catch! Trooper311 Thanks for the write up Cody. I have noticed something of late with the Google app. I thought it was because I was on beta, but I got off of beta and it still does the same thing on my Pixel XL. Also on my wife's Moto X. For the weather cards, instead of saying the town that I am in, it states the township that I am in. This travels with me wherever I am. Home, work, a store etc. Any news on this by chance? Thanks. Cody Toombs I live in a place that barely exists, so I've always been bumped into neighboring areas. For that reason, I never really notice when things like that behave abnormally. Sorry. Trooper311 It's ok man. Appreciate you hitting me back. Cheers. CasperTFG #oceans11 Carson Saldanha Search bar in the notification panel seems pretty legit to me. DragoCubed Full-width widgets in the notification bar? Yes please. Search bar in the notification bar? Not so exciting Dennis Ulijn Can the search bar in the notification panel not be a reply line, like you get in messaging apps like hangouts, messages and whatsapp? Bombaglad i imagine that could be pretty easy to implement it that way for any 3rd party dev as a separate app (please correct me if i am wrong) Multiling O Keyboard Yes, I'm thinking to add app shortcuts to it with my Renegade Launcher app. ilovetesla whats the use of a pollen counter?? Cody Toombs "Pollen counts are measured from low, meaning they affect few individuals, to high, meaning symptoms affect most allergy sufferers." source ilovetesla but, a phone counting "pollen" WTF is this tech man Sup Are you being serious right now? Red No, he's being serious next Thursday. Quint’s Sharking & Seashells Busy on Thursday, how about Friday? Cody Toombs Is this is a serious misunderstanding or are you trolling? The actual data collection happens at a facility that monitors pollen counts, and the results are then sent out for people to see on their phones. Derek Ross Pixel 2 will come with pollen sensors. You heard it here first. ilovetesla ohhhh ... OK .i thought there will be some kind of sensor in future android devices that measures pollen things dammit !!!! i'm bad Cody Toombs lol, it's cool. We all do it from time to time :) Quint’s Sharking & Seashells I know, its bad enough that a phone can tell you how much rain we get. I don't want my phone getting wet. This is nonsense and i'm talking out of my ass. Quint’s Sharking & Seashells Sorry, a little off topic, but do any of you have an issue where the weather icons do not show up in the Google Now widget? Peacen1k Been an issue over several versions, so for quite some time now. Also, only 2 rows of tiles show up, the rest of the widget space is empty. Kawshik Ahmed Maybe it will be something like this. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9abe1606e0efd2996cb434a33131a56a45a2a60b329ed1a4cec68331a778fafb.jpg 9+10=21 Nice jodieisme Thursday, July 28th..?🙈 Oasis Feng I guess the search bar in notification panel will be a normal notification with quick reply functionality as input field for quick search. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Time to start moving things to the bottom of the UI Google. #WebOs David Hyman I would be happy if it was implemented like how Textra handles the quick SMS notification. You hit the notification and the search widget appears as an overlay on top of everything else. They already have this overlay created too so it would be quick to implement in my opinion Ben Roberts I downloaded the apk but I don't see any search in the notifications Cody Toombs This is a teardown. Note the big disclaimer at the top and regular use of future tense as the feature is described. Captain_Invisible That means you have to read more than the title... Gonzales I see the search bar in the feed but not in the pull down notification, which is where I would like it. Rami I would like the search bar there, or back in overview. There's no way to easily open Google from Assistant without multiple taps, and my home screen setup has no room for a search bar.

Now it looks like Google may be cooking up some new headphones, too. An entry for Google-branded Bluetooth headphones has appeared in the FCC. The listing includes several images of the headphones, which feature Google’s signature four colors in a circle on each ear cup.  According to the user manual included with the FCC entry, these headphones are model number GID5B and feature Bluetooth, ANC (active noise cancellation), a 3.5mm headphone jack, volume buttons, and a multi-function button (MFB) that you press to answer calls and play/pause music. The headphones charge over microUSB and feature a 600mAh battery. Here are the full specs included with the manual: Driver Type: Dynamic Diver Diameter: 40mm Driver Impedance: 32 Ohms± 15%Ω  Sensitivity: 101dB±3dB/mW (ANC Off), 100dB±3dB/mW (ANC On) Frequency Range: 12Hz-20KHz ANC Peak Value: >25dB ANC Bandwidth: 25Hz-1KHz Battery Capacity: 600mAh Play Time: >25 hours @ BT on streaming at 1/2 ROP without ANC on, >16 hours Plus ANC on, >10 hours at Max Level Dimension: 195±5*170±5*94±5 (unit mm) What’s still unclear is what these headphones are for. Based on what we can learn from this FCC listing, they appear to be a fairly regular pair of Bluetooth headphones. The wireless headphone market doesn’t seem like something that Google would get into unless it had a product with some sort of special feature. Would you buy these Google headphones if they’re released to the public?
