But in an interview with the Financial Times he said he was ready to call for a cut if unemployment picked up. He said: At the moment I think the economy still has some slack left in the labour market, you can see that in the subdued pace of pay growth. If the jobless rate were to rise, increasing labour market slack further, then that would be an argument in favour of lower interest rates. On the other hand he believed the UK economy was set for a less severe slowdown than most economists expect. He said: In the near term, the next year or two, I think the economy will slow, but perhaps not slow as much as the consensus has been expecting. This is partly because of the support from loose financial conditions, partly because of the underlying advantages - including supply side flexibility - of the UK economy.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.01pm EDT 12:01 Bank of Japan - what could it do? Ahead of the US Federal Reserve decision comes the latest from the Bank of Japan, with the results of its comprehensive review of monetary policy expected. Analysts are uncertain what this might bring in practise, whether it be a further push into negative rate territory or further economic stimulus. But most believe there will be no change to the Bank of Japan’s inflation target of 2%. James Stanley, currency analyst at DailyFX, said: The big question is whether this review will lead-in to more stimulus or an introduction of monetary prudence. Many are questioning Japan’s ability to do more stimulus given the size of their programs over the past four years; although in that last Bank of Japan press conference [governor Haruhiko] Kuroda addressed this head on, sharing his view that the BoJ hasn’t yet hit the limits of monetary expansion. But there are some very big peripheral questions to be answered by the BoJ in this review, as in what are they going to do about the 2% target that they announced in April 2013 that they said they expected to hit in 2 years? That was April of 2015, or approximately 17 months ago, and yet we’re still very far away from that target being realistically met. Also at issue are negative rates...would they dare to do more here given that results have been non-existent? And in terms of asset purchases: The BoJ has been buying ¥80 Trillion a year in assets for a few years now. They’re already cornering their own government bond market. Does the BoJ dare do more after four years have shown little hope of actually kick-starting inflation? So, nobody really knows what the BoJ will say during this review to be released tonight. This could lead to hazardous conditions if trading around the Yen as markets are appearing to approach tonight’s event rather tepidly under the same guise of uncertainty that we are. Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda. Photograph: Kazuhiro Nogi/AFP/Getty Images Simon MacAdam at Capital Economics said: We expect the BoJ to cut its policy rate deeper into negative territory today which, according to the Overnight Index Swap market, does not appear to be expected until early next year. Admittedly, it is more difficult to gauge where we sit relative to the market on the prospects for further unconventional policy easing in Japan. But we suspect that we are more dovish. [There has been] speculation that there will be a policy shift away from asset purchases. Indeed, the yield curve has steepened recently in anticipation of the BoJ adopting this stance: long-dated yields have hit six-month highs this month. We believe, though, that the BoJ’s Comprehensive Policy Review will throw open the door to innovative policy measures. Rather than scale back its asset purchases, we think that the Bank may increase them and is more likely to find other ways to support systemically-important institutions, such as lending to commercial banks at negative interest rates.

Sterling fell as low as $1.2948 and is currently down 0.55% at $1.2950 amid worries about the outcome of talks about Britain leaving the European Union, especially with some EU members promising there would be no easy ride. The strength of the dollar is also a factor, with the outside chance of a US rate rise at this week’s Federal Reserve meeting. Investors are also nervous ahead of the forthcoming Bank of Japan meeting. Currency markets are also unnerved by the prospect that Donald Trump may win the forthcoming US election. Neil Wilson, markets analyst at ETX Capital, said: The pound seems to be a victim of some skittishness ahead the major central bank meetings this week in Japan and the US. Markets anticipate the Fed will keep rates on hold but a hike is not being ruled out, which may be rattling traders. Moreover, even if the US central bank holds fire, traders seem primed for a ‘hawkish hold’ where the Fed would effectively give the green light for the fed funds rate to increase later this year, probably in December. All eyes are on whether long-time dove Boston Fed president Eric Rosengren shifts his stance and votes for a hike, as some have speculated he might. Despite talk of a Brexit bounce, the pound has come under pressure of late. It’s now trading close to 5 cents off its high of September 6th. The pace of the sell-off picked up markedly after the Bank of England said last week that it still expects to cut rates again this year. If UK data continues to remain solid, the Bank might have row back on that prediction, which could be positive for the pound.

The Wall Street opening bell has been rung for the last full trading session before America’s central bank sets monetary policy. And shares are rallying in New York, and in Europe, as investors wager that the US Federal Reserve will decide not to raise interest rates tomorrow. The Dow Jones industrial average has gained 104 points, or 0.6%, in early trading to 18,224. Nearly every company on the index has risen. The broader S&P 500 index has gained 0.5%.

London’s FTSE 100 has gained 40 points, on top of Monday’s 103-point jump. Today’s weak-looking US housing data has left many traders concluding that the Fed won’t risk a shock hike tomorrow. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets explain why: The September FOMC meeting is finally upon us. It has been the subject of considerable speculation along the way, especially in late August when various Fed speakers were signaling a desire to raise rates. However, U.S. economic data has since cooled as twin ISM numbers printed weakly and a sprinkling of other measures also disappointed expectations. Accordingly, market expectations have drifted down to around a 20% chance of a rate increase from the current 0.375% level at this meeting. Historically, the Fed has never raised rates unless the market has assigned a likelihood of 60% or higher. As such, a rate hike is now quite unlikely for September. However... a couple of Wall Street dealers believe the Fed could defy expectations, and vote to raise interest rates.....

Our correspondent Henry McDonald reports: Ireland should woo UK firms who want to remain trading in the EU to relocate to cities like Dublin, Cork and Limerick, the British-Irish Chamber of Commerce said today. The Anglo-Irish trade body’s Director General John McGrane said the Republic should follow the lead of other EU states and cities that were seeking to persuade UK firms to set up bases within the Eurozone post-Brexit. McGrane also warned that Ireland – with its land border with Northern Ireland and the fact that its single biggest trading partner is the UK – is the most exposed EU country to Brexit. He was speaking a seminar on Brexit and Ireland organised by the main opposition party in the Dail, Fianna Fail, in Carlow today. Accepting and respecting the UK vote on Brexit, McGrade told the think-in: “Enterprises think about multi-location and so Ireland should rightly be the natural first choice for UK employers looking for a guaranteed EU base and equally Irish firms looking to secure trade with the UK should consider a UK base. With other EU cities encouraging migration of UK firms, we shouldn’t be shy to lay out our own advantages and to encourage investment in Ireland from anyone looking to trade inside the EU.” He also called on the Irish government to implement a “National Brexit Strategy Plan” to cope with the shocks of the UK outside the EU. Meanwhile in Belfast, Ryanair boss Michael O’Leary has warned that investment will suffer while the Brexit drama plays out.

But Janet Williamson, chair of the Trade Union Share Owners, suggests that the new independent review is a good opportunity for a fresh start. “This is good news for Sports Direct workers, especially young workers who make up a large part of their staff but too often get a poor deal at work. “The board should now consult both shareholders and trade unions in finalising the plans for the independent review. Trade unions representing workers at Sports Direct stand ready to work with the company to ensure a successful future that is fair for its staff.” Unions will presumably be pushing Ashley to offer permanent contracts to the 4,000-ish agency workers, who are employed at Shirebrook on effectively zero-hours contracts. Updated at 8.00am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.14am EDT 07:14 We don’t often find the City singing from the same hymn sheet as Britain’s unions. But the two sides are united today. After putting pressure on Ashley for months, investors are generally welcoming the decision to hold a properly independent review of Sports Direct’s operations. Paul Lee, head of corporate governance at Aberdeen Asset Management, called it a “good start”: The fact that the review will now be undertaken by an independent party provides comfort and I am sure all shareholders will welcome the opportunity to offer constructive thoughts on the remit of the review. There is much more work to be done but hopefully today is the first step on the long journey to rebuild investor trust and to rectify the problems at SportsDirect. All shareholders want a well governed, sustainable business.” Andy Griffiths, executive director of the Investor Forum, is also pleased: Our Members believe this is an opportunity to bring about meaningful and lasting change, and are committed to working constructively with the Board and the independent reviewer to ensure it can be a turning point in rebuilding trust.” Relations between Mike Ashley and the City hit a nadir this month when investors voted against chairman Keith Hellawell’s reappointment. They are also unhappy that Mike Ashley’s brother has a deal to deliver Sports Direct products abroad. Eyebrows have also been raised over the appointment of Michael Murray, boyfriend of Ashley’s elder daughter Anna, as a property consultant. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.45am EDT 06:45 The Unite union reckon Mike Ashley has now “grasped” the need to tackle the employment problems at Sports Direct. They are also pushing the government to outlaw zero-hours contracts (reminder: Ashley is offering permanent contracts to all workers at his retail shops, but not to agency staff at the retailer’s Derbyshire warehouse). Unite assistant general secretary Steve Turner says: “Increasingly businesses are recognising that they have no place in the modern workplace and are bad for workers, bad for business and bad for the economy. The government should now show leadership and follow the lead of government’s like New Zealand and ban zero-hours contracts.” Updated at 7.04am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.28am EDT 06:28 Jon Tricket, Labour’s shadow business secretary, has criticised Mike Ashley for dragging his feet over allowing an independent review of Sports Direct.

Speaking after the firm announced it would have an independent review of its working practices and corporate governance, he reiterated his apology for things that had gone wrong but insisted there have also been positives at the retailer. He defended his expensive method of travel, and said the government is responsible for workers being paid the minimum wage, not him. He told BBC Breakfast: “I do fly to work by helicopter, it’s a reality. So when people say, ‘Oh be real’, that’s how I travel.” He added: “People will say, ‘How can you have a plane when your workers are on minimum wage?’ “I said, ‘But I don’t set the minimum wage.’ If the minimum wage would be the living wage, then the government who set the rules should set it at the living wage. That’s as I look at it.” Mr Ashley put the poor practices discovered at the business down to a “rotten apple in the barrel” and said there are a lot of good things about the firm. He said: “I can tell you in the last five years Sports Direct will have paid out over 200 million in bonuses. So I can tell you the cleaning lady got an £80,000 bonus on top of her normal pay. Nobody in the UK has done that. “What we’ve got to do is focus on getting the bits we’ve got wrong, to the extreme highs of the bits we’ve got right. “And paying out that kind of money doesn’t mean you’re allowed to get these bits wrong, where clearly I’ve taken my eye off the ball. “I’ve said sorry, I’ve said I’m going to fix it, and I will.” Describing himself as a bit of a “PR nightmare”, he referred to the moment he joked that he had been to the casino after he pulled a wad of cash from his pocket when he was showing investors and journalists around the Shirebrook warehouse earlier this month. Photograph: David Sillitoe for the Guardian He said: “The one thing people didn’t say to me was, ‘Mike, have you checked how much money you’ve got in your pocket?’ And of course nobody thought to ask me whether or not I had genuinely been to the casino a few days earlier.” Updated at 6.18am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1 of 3 Newest Newer Older Oldest Topics Sports Direct International Stock markets Federal Reserve Economics US economy More… Mike Ashley Retail industry Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Reuse this content View all comments > Order by newest oldest recommendations Show 25 25 50 100 All Threads collapsed expanded unthreaded Loading comments… Trouble loading?

Instead, marketers should look at micro-moments and customer intent. Ok, now I’ve got your attention, let’s step back a bit. What does intent mean and what does this all have to do with Google Analytics? And what the heck is a micro-moment? Demographic Data And Google Analytics Google, in their pursuit to know everything about you, collects demographic information like age and gender from a few sources and provides this data in aggregate to you and I via Google Analytics. If you’re interested, you can find it under the Audience bucket alongside other interesting segments like affinity and interests. Here you’ll learn the approximate age of your visitors alongside useful metrics like conversion rate, % of new visitors etc. You’ll even learn about their interests and so-called affinities. What are you going to do with this knowledge? Does this change the way you act? In a nutshell, so what? My own demographic data shows that about 70% of my website audience are men. However, my website design has a far more feminine design aesthetic (the design team was both men and women). Should I re-brand? Or should I perhaps look beyond the superficial and strive to meet the needs of my customers? Demographic Data Doesn’t Explain What and Why Demographic data isn’t nearly as useful as expected when it comes to understanding why your audience visits your site. Here are some examples to demonstrate this point: Between the ages of 18 to 29, more than double the number of men consider themselves to be “gamers” and yet in that same age group, women account for nearly 70% of all mobile searches for video games. Another classic canard is that if you’d like to market baby products, your target audience are young mothers, aged 25 to 34. Well, about 40% of all baby product purchasers don’t even have kids. I (male, 36) purchased baby-centric goods three times this month; once for my nephew, again for a friend’s newborn and then for another friend’s impending baby. If I had a website about gaming, should I write content for men or women? Neither. I should write content that serves the needs of my website visitors. Intent, when it comes to web analytics, is not about who the visitor is. It’s about what that visitor would like to accomplish and why they’re at my site. Demographic data is passive. Intent is the first step in a series of visitor actions! What Motivates Our Website Visitors? Demographic data has a role to play in product development, branding and communication. When it comes to understanding site visitors and their motivations, demographics fall short. People come to your website to do, to buy, to learn, to engage. These are what Google calls micro-moments. By considering the intent, that is to say, the micro-moment that drives someone online and ultimately to your website, you’ll be positioned to meet that intent and improve your visitor experience. The Road To Finding Intent There are four main types of intent and while Google considers these to be “micro-moments,” these are equally valid as indicators of intent. Intent 1: I Want To Know The visitor is looking learn and you’re the expert. While the visitor might not plan to purchase right now, you have a clear opportunity to build a relationship with them and be their purveyor of choice later. Are you being informative? Are you set up to capture an email address to send them more details? Intent 2: I Want To Go This is the “local” moment. These site visitors are looking to connect in-person and that means easily finding your address and directions is key. But there’s more! What are your hours of operation and your menu? Do you have a specific product in stock? Intent 3:  I Want To Do Helping someone accomplish a challenging task crates a moment of delight. These site visitors need help and your clear, helpful advice is what gets them through. Whether it’s a recipe, or a how-to video, content that helps builds fans and followers. Intent 4: I Want To Buy When a site visitor is ready to buy, are you making it easy for them? Do you have all the product information handy? Is your site optimized for mobile purchasers? What objections could someone have to making that purchase right now and how can you anticipate that? The Steps To Micro-moment Self-Assessment Step 1: To find which micro-moments your customers are hoping you’ll fulfill, list the reasons someone might visit your site. Consider whether they’re finding you via search engines, are they looking to learn something new, are they looking to buy now or are they in the early stages of product research? Then group your visitors into the type of intent. Step 2: Write down how you currently meet the need of that visitor. It’s important to critically explore how you’re matching the intent of your audience. You’re probably doing it really well for some needs and falling short elsewhere and that’s alright. Google Analytics will help you find opportunities to improve. Step 3: Google Analytics provides a wealth of contextual signals to help you gauge your success. By thinking about the behavior that intent generates, and then segmenting your analytics accordingly, you’ll know how your site performs relative to visitor needs. Step 4: Explore how you could do better. Find opportunities to improve in your analytics and then decide on a course of action (often it’s quite easy to act on intent). Step 5: Measure the results. Measuring your results is how you keep score and know whether your decisions are the correct ones. Uncovering Intent Success in Google Analytics In Google Analytics, there are a number of ways to glean context and see if you’re winning these visitors over. Review each micro-moment, one by one and think about which data can help you judge and measure success. Take a look at your organic search traffic. What are the top queries? Do your landing pages meet the implied intent? Segment by device and discover whether mobile searchers have different needs. According to Google, only 9% of users will stay on a mobile site or app if it is difficult to find information or navigate easily. Referral traffic has a wealth of information that demonstrates intent. By reviewing the content of the referring link, you’ll be able to understand the expectations of visitors. Again, by segmenting referral traffic by device, you’ll be able to understand what mobile searchers need from you. Google Analytics’ location data can tell you if your local efforts are working while conversion rates, bounce rates and pageviews per session all indicate engagement with your actual content. Looking at Behavior > Site Content > All Pages data as well as multi-channel attribution will likely be enlightening too! Ask And Answer On Your Visitors’ Behalf For every type of micro-moment or intent, there are data available in Google Analytics. The right dimensions and metrics, however, depend on the above steps to self-discovery and on you challenging your own assumptions. Be critical, solicit customer feedback and keep looking for ways to meet intent. The end result is rewarding for you and for your audience! Related posts: Surprise Board Meeting?

Follow TechnoBuffalo Google Photos is already a great option for storing your pictures and videos in the cloud to clear some storage space on your smartphone. Now there are two more reasons to download the app. Google announced a big update for Photos this week, adding quicker sharing and new movies that the app can create automatically using your uploads. Both new features should be available now across Android, iOS and online. The new sharing feature makes it possible to send off a photo even faster than before. Just tap on a picture and then hit the share button in the bottom left corner. You’ll see a new row of faces to choose from, along with the option to search through your entire contacts list. Once you pick a few recipients just type out a quick message and hit send. The photo will show up as a notification in Google Photos, or as a link via text or email if they don’t have the app. The Assistant feature in Google Photos is getting an upgrade as well. It can already make simple movies and GIFs with the latest photos you upload, but now it can also create short movies based on “creative concepts.” For example, the app can collect pictures of your child as they grow up and create a montage set to music. Google says it’s also rolling out concepts for summer fun and formal celebrations like a wedding. The app should update automatically, but if you don’t have Google Photos you can also grab it now via the source links below.

The most obvious change in nomenclature pertains to Now on Tap, Google’s AI-powered feature that surfaces info like movie showtimes, flight information, language translations, and more by snapping a picture of your smartphone’s display. It has gained the generic, self-descriptive moniker ‘Screen search’ and Now on Tap appears to have been removed from every relevant settings screen within the Google Search app. Related: Google debuts Allo, an AI-powered messaging client for Android and iOS Now on Tap is not the only term the new app has sandblasted. Google Now cards, the geometric tidbits within the Google Now interface that recommended nearby attractions, news items of interest, and upcoming events, now go by a different title: Feed. The writing was on the wall. Over the past few months, Google’s favored the ‘Assistance’ brand as a catchall term for AI-powered features. In the Google Photos app for iOS and Android, an ‘assistant’ notifies when photos are being processed, when your device is running low on internal storage, and whether your phone is waiting to charge before uploading. According to Android Police, Google’s internally testing a version of its Inbox email client that will automatically organize and surface tasks. Related: Google Assistant wants to be your one-stop shop for everything Encouraging the rebranding along could be a slow uptake. Now on Tap was plagued by inaccuracies and launched in a relatively bare-bones state — short of scanning your screen, there was not much Now on Tap could do. Subsequent updates rejiggered the feature’s focus on convenience: the newest iteration of Now on Tap features shortcuts to reminders, alarms, timers, navigation to saved locations like work and home. But it is likely all preparation ahead of the launch of Google Assistant, the Mountain View, California-based company’s platform intended to unify Google’s disparate assistance apps. Google Assistant, at its core, will work much like Google Now, answering text and voice queries on command — ask it, “Did my team win?” and it will spit out the latest box scores for the sports you follow. But all the more impressive, it will consider personal preference and linguistic context in its responses, too — request movie tickets for a party of four and Assistant will only surface screenings at least four seats available. And it has a personality — Google worked with an ex-Pixar animator to ensure the Assistant “had character” and “showed vulnerability.” Related: Google Now on Tap gains text translation, bar code scanning features The Google Assistant will permeate far more corners of Google’s hardware and software ecosystem than Google Now ever did. It will integrate tightly with Google’s upcoming Allo messaging app for Android and iOS, for one, offering both text replies to typed questions and Smart Replies, or machine learning-generated responses to emails and texts. And the Assistant is expected to form the core of Google’s forthcoming Home, standalone speaker-and-microphone hardware that will fling YouTube videos to a nearby Chromecast, set timers and alarms, track your flight information, keep tabs on your appointments, provide weather and traffic info, and more on verbal command. Rumor has it Assistant’s tendrils will extend even further with the launch of Google’s flagship smartphones, reportedly the Pixel and Pixel XL. Leaked home screen software, Pixel Launcher, adopts a design that appears to provide quick, convenience access to the Google Assistant. And it packs a new interface, called Dashboard that seems primed to surface contextually relevant information of the sort currently served by Google Now. Despite a splashy debut at Google’s I/O conference earlier this year, the Assistant has so far proven elusive. It has been suggested that Google’s ambitious AI effort will feature heavily at the search giant’s upcoming press conference on October 4. Digital Trends will be reporting live from Google’s campus then, so stay tuned. Also watch: Apple iPhone 6S Plus vs. Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Please enable Javascript to watch this video

Major technology companies have agreed not to display ads promoting gender selection in India. India's health ministry on Monday told India's Supreme Court that Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft will block any online ads for tools that would help parents in India engage in prenatal gender testing, the BBC reports. That incldues 22 keywords associated with the practice. Google will also ban auto-complete suggestions related to gender selection, Bloomberg says. //Related Articles India to Require Panic Buttons on Phones Sex-selective abortions were banned in 1996, but such restrictions have had "little effect...on the sex ratio at birth," according to a 2015 United Nations report. There is "a general preference for sons in India, which is expressed in special treatment for boys in terms of parental investment in nutrition, vaccinations, access to health treatment, and parental care in general," the UN report says, making India the country with the lowest sex ratio in under-5 mortality (93 boys to 100 girls). Overall, there are 943 females per 1,000 males India, according to 2011 census data, giving it "one of the most unbalanced gender ratios in the world," the BBC notes. India's Supreme Court previously threatened the companies with a ban if they didn't remove ads for sex-selection services, but the companies pushed back.

The app, called Google Trips, automatically pulls details about a user’s trip from their Gmail email and recommends restaurants, attractions and “local gems” based on data gleaned from other travellers, Google said on Monday in a blog post. Users can download saved itineraries and reservations so they don’t need to worry about cellular coverage when they get to their destination. File picture: Eric Gaillard. Credit: REUTERS Trips adds to Google’s presence in the travel market and steps up the search giant’s competition with dedicated travel and review apps such as TripAdvisor and Yelp. TripAdvisor Chief Executive Officer Steve Kaufer has said in the past that Google has the potential to be a “serious threat”. Home-sharing startup Airbnb also is working on a trip-planning app of its own. Google’s effort gives people another reason to use the company’s Gmail and Maps apps, which feed data into Trips, instead of using similar services offered by rivals like Apple. TripAdvisor fell as much as 2.4 percent to $59.85 in New York after the announcement, while shares of Google parent Alphabet were little changed. Google has dabbled in trip-planning previously. Its Inbox email app already collects users’ flight and hotel reservations and organises them by trip. Mountain View, California-based Google bought the restaurant review firm Zagat in 2011 and travel guide publisher Frommer’s a year later to add specialised content to Google Maps. The Trips app brings that all together. Instead of toggling between Gmail or Inbox, Maps and wherever you saved restaurant recommendations from your friends, Trips lets you do that all in one place. Still, users won’t be able to book activities or restaurants from within the app. These lucrative transactions remain the realm of online travel giants Expedia and Priceline Group, as well as activity-booking startups such as Seattle-based Utrip and San Francisco-based Peek.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Google Drive search refined with natural language processing Brittany A. Roston - Sep 20, 2016 1 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Google Drive’s search has been refined with natural language processing, Google has announced. The functionality is currently only available for Google Drive search on the web, but it is joined by other improvements that make the searching process faster and more simple overall. Simply put, the addition of natural language processing means a user can type a search term phrased the same way they’d say it if they were talking, such as, “find my November 2016 budget.” You’ve probably already experienced natural language searches in Google Search, where you can say something in conventional language and get what you want in response. This works the same way, only obviously it combs through your own content and finds what it thinks you’re looking for. So, for example, instead of typing something awkward and mechanical like “budget spreadsheet 2016 November”, you could just say the aforementioned phrase and get the same result. As you’d expect, Google Drive’s search is going to get better the more you search using natural language, so if it doesn’t work perfectly initially, don’t give up. You’ll notice in the GIF above, Drive also offers “Did you mean” suggestions you can click on to get exactly what you want. In addition to natural language processing support, the update also brings an autocorrect feature to Google Drive search, suggesting what it thinks you meant to type if a misspelling is detected. Meanwhile, Google Docs has received easy column splitting, as well as the auto-saving of an original document when you convert it in Docs, Sheets or Slides.

[...] analysts expect to see new phones that will work with Google’s latest Android operating system and will support a virtual reality platform called Daydream. Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy, expects Google to team up with other manufacturers on lower-price smartphones ranging from $299 to $399 — in line with the Nexus-branded phones it has produced in the past. Google should be aware that Apple has captured much of the higher-end smartphone market and be careful that Android phones aren’t associated only with a lower price range, he said. Google may also discuss more details about its virtual reality headset and controller that will work with smartphones and the Daydream platform. Apps for Daydream will be crucial to its success, said Ramon Llamas, an IDC research manager. In addition to the phones, Google is expected to reveal prices and a release date for Google Home, its Internet-connected device similar to the Amazon Echo. » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Source: Reuters - Next Media - on September 10, 2016< > Embed Google files patent for light-sensing technology to help self-driving cars yield to police 00:45 Google has submitted a new patent as part of its self-driving car project for technology that will allow cars to yield to emergency and police vehicles.

The Wall Street Journal  reports Google's parent company, Alphabet Inc., said digging up streets in areas that need service has been much more costly and time consuming than initially expected. SEE MORE: Google Set To Bring Fiber-Style Competition To Wireless And that's a problem for a company that wants to bring high-speed internet to the masses. So here's how the company is fixing it: a completely wire-free connection, which means no more digging up people's yards to lay down fiber-optic cables. The push toward wireless means Google is joining the ranks of telecommunications company AT&T, which expects to conduct testing for its wireless connection  later this year . SEE MORE: AT&T And Google Are Fighting Over The Future Of Fiber Internet In the meantime, Google is asking cities and power companies to build the networks themselves, rather than having to come out and plant the lines.

With this in mind, Gmail -- and Inbox by Google -- are undergoing a redesign to improve things. With the redesign, Google says that it is focusing on adjusting the formatting and general look so that it better suits the device emails are being viewed on. You may well have thought that this should have been the case from the beginning, but it seems that an update is in order. Later this month, a new version of the Gmail app will roll out to Android devices, while web users will also see a tweaked version of Gmail. What the changes mean is that screen elements will be more intelligently resized according to the device they’re being viewed on. Google is referring to it as a new 'responsive design' and there are guidelines for developers to follow. Writing on the Gmail blog, Google says: Starting later this month, Gmail and Inbox by Gmail will support emails created with responsive design, meaning their content adapts to fit screens of all sizes. Text, links, and even buttons will enlarge to make reading and tapping easier on a smaller screen. If you’re on desktop, you’ll also see improvements, since emails designed for mobile can also adapt to fit larger screens. 19 Comments Tweet Got News?

Weiss  |  Posted 2016-09-20 Print               The Pixel smartphones have been rumored for months, as well as a new Daydream VR headset and an updated Google Chromecast dongle. For months, Google's upcoming Pixel smartphones, its Daydream VR headset and an improved Chromecast dongle have been rumored. Now, Google has released a video teaser that shows an animated outline of a smartphone along with an Oct. 4 event date notice, where the company is likely to announce the rumored new products. Device fans can enter their email address on the page and click the "Notify Me" to receive updates from Google as the products arrive and are unveiled. The Oct. 4 event will be held in San Francisco but is also being live-streamed on YouTube.com/Google. The two Android smartphone models, which are reportedly called the Google Pixel and Pixel XL phones, have been designed by Google rather than third-party suppliers, but are built by HTC, according to earlier reports. The Google smartphones have been rumored since May, according to an earlier eWEEK story. By directly designing the devices, Google could have more control and oversight of its hugely popular Android mobile operating system, which could help it take on Apple more directly in the smartphone wars, the story reported. The two upcoming devices were apparently code-named Marlin (M1) and Sailfish (S1) as they went through the development process, according to earlier reports. Google has offered Android handsets in the past through arrangements with manufacturers such as HTC, Huawei and others, but those handsets were designed by those companies and carried Google Nexus nameplates, without Google's own designs. Google has not previously designed and built its own phones. Earlier in September, a rumor from a well-known IT tipster circulated about Google's potential plans for a 7-inch tablet computer that will be built by Huawei and offered for sale by the end of 2016. "Google's Huawei-built 7-inch tablet, with 4GB RAM, on track for release before the end of the year," tipster Evan Blass wrote in the recent post, which lacked any additional details. Google's last 7-inch Android tablet was the Nexus 7. Blass' Twitter handle is @evleaks. The rumored machine could be announced by Google at the Oct. 4 event. Also in September, Google suspended one of its other recent smartphone initiatives, its Project Ara smartphone effort, which began in 2013 with the concept of designing a phone platform that would incorporate a wide array of camera, audio and other modules as desired by users. Project Ara was ended as part of an effort to streamline the company's hardware efforts, even after its progress was touted at Google's I/O developer conference earlier this year. The Ara phones centered on a baseplate or frame that incorporated a display, CPU, graphics processing unit, sensors and all the functionality of a standard smartphone. Google was scheduled to release a preview version of Ara this fall in a bid to spur developer interest in the technology and ensure that modules for a wide range of applications would be available for the smartphone at launch. Organizations that were working with Google in developing modules for Ara included Samsung and Sony. Among the modules that Google was working on was one that would integrate the functions of a glucometer so people with diabetes could measure their glucose levels using their smartphones. In March, a Google Nexus handset, the Nexus 5X, debuted as the second phone being sold for use with Google's Project Fi mobile phone services. The Nexus 5X smartphone is made by LG for use with the inexpensive monthly wireless service plans, which start at $20 a month. The Nexus 5X is priced at $349 for a 16GB model or $399 for a 32GB model. Project Fi came out in April 2014 under what was then an invitation-only system. Project Fi phone services recently opened to all users who buy or provide a compatible Nexus smartphone that will work with the service. So far, the Nexus 6P by Huawei, the new Nexus 5X and the earlier Nexus 6 are the only three smartphones that will work with Project Fi's network. Users pay $20 per month for cellular access, plus data fees of $10 per GB only for the data that is consumed each month. The monthly access fee also includes unlimited talk and texting, WiFi tethering and international coverage in more than 120 countries.           LATEST MOBILE ARTICLES   Apple And PayPal Enable Payments Through Siri Voice Commands Revamped Google Play Music to Use Machine Learning to Suggest Songs Google Rebuts EU Complaint About Android Bundling Charges GoPro Recalls All 2,500 of the New Karma Drones Sold to Customers Google Gives Gmail for iOS Major Overhaul                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

Photo: Michael Macor, The Chronicle Buy this photo Google expected to unveil phones, VR headset in October 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Analysts expect Google to unveil its latest Android smartphones, a virtual reality headset and an Internet-connected device for the home that will rival the Amazon Echo at an event the company has set for Oct. 4. Google has divulged few clues to its intentions. But analysts expect to see new phones that will work with Google’s latest Android operating system and will support a virtual reality platform called Daydream. The phones may also command a premium price: Some analysts predict that the new devices, under the Pixel brand, will cost $499 to $649, putting them in line with Apple’s iPhone 7, which starts at $649. Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy, expects Google to team up with other manufacturers on cheaper smartphones ranging from $299 to $399 — priced similarly to the Nexus-branded phones it has produced in the past. (Some analysts expect the Nexus brand to be discontinued, but Moorhead thinks it will remain.) ALSO Lyft replaces famous mustache with glowing Amp on dashboards PG&E plugs fast-rising executive Geisha Williams into CEO role Fake news hurts Google, Facebook; PayPal boycott woes Google should be aware that Apple has captured much of the higher-end smartphone market and be careful that the Android name isn’t associated only with cheaper phones, he said. “To me, they should charge as high a price as they can, without getting piggish on profits.” Google spokeswoman Iska Saric declined to provide specifics on the new products. “Look forward to seeing you on October 4th where all of your questions will be answered,” she wrote in an email. Google may also discuss more details about its virtual reality headset and controller that will work with smartphones and the Daydream platform. Google didn’t reveal the price of for the headset when it introduced it in May. The Daydream platform could give Google an edge on Apple in the fast-emerging VR field, because the iPhone 7 has not been marketed for high-quality VR in the same way. Apps for Daydream will be crucial to its success, said Ramon Llamas, an IDC research manager. “If you are going to have just a handful of applications, this is going to be an expensive toy that only a few people will get their hands on,” he said. In addition to the phones, Google is expected to reveal prices and a release date for Google Home, its Internet-connected device similar to the Amazon Echo. Users can speak to the device, which is roughly the size of a coffee cup, and ask it questions on topics like the weather, schedule appointments or check on deliveries. Google announced Google Home at its developer conference in May. Moorhead said it is crucial for Google to get the device into stores for the holiday shopping season. Otherwise, “they will lose even more momentum to Amazon,” he said. Google is far better known for its software like Gmail and search, not its hardware. But the bonanza of new products is part of the company’s plan to increase the number of users and time spent on its own products and services, said Ali Mogharabi, an equity analyst at Morningstar Inc. “The more users that you have, the more businesses and advertisers that you can attract,” he said.

The feature is available in 75 countries for Android, iOS, and the web. “Google Play Books is the world’s largest ebookstore and offers readers like you smart technology that caters to your lifestyle — where you can start reading a book on your tablet at night and pick up where you left off the next day from your smartphone, as well as easily browse, skim, highlight and make notes,” said Google in a blog post. Google does not really introduce new features for their reading app very often because their market share is very small compared to Amazon, Apple, Barnes and Noble and Kobo.

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media     Google app aims to make vacations easier By George Avalos / September 20, 2016 at 2:58 PM Google has launched a trips app that is designed to make journeys a bit easier by letting people plan out a day in a city. “See more plan less” is how the company describes the primary benefits of the new Google Trips app. The app, available on the Google Play Store and the Apple Apps Store, gives people new ways to plan and organize trips, according to the tech titan’s blog. “It automatically maps out a half day or a full day with suggestions for things to see and do,” the company said in a post that describes the app’s features. People can do things such as pick a city such as New York City or San Francisco or London and then ask the app to find cafes, parks, beaches, restaurants, landmarks, or other points of interest. A user of the app also can switch the type of points of interest at a destination. “Don’t like what you see? Tap the ‘magic wand’ to see more nearby sights,” Google said in a post about the app. “Each tap of the wand gives you a fresh set of nearby attractions.” In its post, the company pointed to research that suggests people often don’t enjoy vacations because it’s too stressful to plan a trip, or once at the destination, travelers miss sites they would have liked to visit. Mountain View-based Google, in its post, cited a study in 2013 by GoodThink expert Shawn Achor, a researcher into positive psychology. “Travel can make people happier, healthier and more productive when they return from a vacation,” Achor wrote in his report. “But not all travel creates happiness. Travel stress can undo the positive effects of travel.” The app is also available offline, Google said. “Google Trips is a personalized tour guide in your pocket,” the company said. “Each trip contains key categories of information, including day plans, reservations, things to do, food & drink, and more, so you have everything you need at your fingertips.”   Image: Google Trips images found on the company’s web sites   Share this: Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Reddit Google More Pinterest Tumblr   Tags: App, Google, map, Mountain View, Silicon Valley, Tech, trips, vacation   More Posts in Silicon Beat Facebook discovers more miscalculated ad metrics November 16, 2016   On topic: Tech news to know now November 16, 2016   Weeping guitars: Prince’s estate sues Jay Z’s company over music streaming on Tidal November 16, 2016       Share this Post Tweet       Lizzie Saito I tried this for a week, and I’m disappointed.

With the upcoming release of the Pixel and Pixel XL, Google may finally give users the ability to restart their phone. A tipster provided the below picture to Android Police who have verified that the image of the power menu was taken on Pixel device running Android 7.1. As they pointed out, the restart option is being run on a beta build of 7.1 which means that this might only be available for the Google developers who are currently finishing testing on the operating system. We currently do not know if this restart option will still be available in Android 7.1 when it gets an official release or even if it will be available on Nexus devices. What we do know is that people have been asking for this option in stock Android — and we might finally get it. Guides Android Breaking news for Android.

The most obvious change in nomenclature pertains to Now on Tap, Google’s AI-powered feature that surfaces info like movie showtimes, flight information, language translations, and more by snapping a picture of your smartphone’s display. It has gained the generic, self-descriptive moniker ‘Screen search’ and Now on Tap appears to have been removed from every relevant settings screen within the Google Search app. Related: Google debuts Allo, an AI-powered messaging client for Android and iOS Now on Tap is not the only term the new app has sandblasted. Google Now cards, the geometric tidbits within the Google Now interface that recommended nearby attractions, news items of interest, and upcoming events, now go by a different title: Feed. The writing was on the wall. Over the past few months, Google’s favored the ‘Assistance’ brand as a catchall term for AI-powered features. In the Google Photos app for iOS and Android, an ‘assistant’ notifies when photos are being processed, when your device is running low on internal storage, and whether your phone is waiting to charge before uploading. According to Android Police, Google’s internally testing a version of its Inbox email client that will automatically organize and surface tasks.

Now on Tap was plagued by inaccuracies and launched in a relatively bare-bones state — short of scanning your screen, there was not much Now on Tap could do. Subsequent updates rejiggered the feature’s focus on convenience: the newest iteration of Now on Tap features shortcuts to reminders, alarms, timers, navigation to saved locations like work and home. But it is likely all preparation ahead of the launch of Google Assistant, the Mountain View, California-based company’s platform intended to unify Google’s disparate assistance apps. Google Assistant, at its core, will work much like Google Now, answering text and voice queries on command — ask it, “Did my team win?” and it will spit out the latest box scores for the sports you follow. But all the more impressive, it will consider personal preference and linguistic context in its responses, too — request movie tickets for a party of four and Assistant will only surface screenings at least four seats available. And it has a personality — Google worked with an ex-Pixar animator to ensure the Assistant “had character” and “showed vulnerability.” Related: Google Now on Tap gains text translation, bar code scanning features The Google Assistant will permeate far more corners of Google’s hardware and software ecosystem than Google Now ever did. It will integrate tightly with Google’s upcoming Allo messaging app for Android and iOS, for one, offering both text replies to typed questions and Smart Replies, or machine learning-generated responses to emails and texts. And the Assistant is expected to form the core of Google’s forthcoming Home, standalone speaker-and-microphone hardware that will fling YouTube videos to a nearby Chromecast, set timers and alarms, track your flight information, keep tabs on your appointments, provide weather and traffic info, and more on verbal command. Rumor has it Assistant’s tendrils will extend even further with the launch of Google’s flagship smartphones, reportedly the Pixel and Pixel XL. Leaked home screen software, Pixel Launcher, adopts a design that appears to provide quick, convenience access to the Google Assistant. And it packs a new interface, called Dashboard that seems primed to surface contextually relevant information of the sort currently served by Google Now. Despite a splashy debut at Google’s I/O conference earlier this year, the Assistant has so far proven elusive. It has been suggested that Google’s ambitious AI effort will feature heavily at the search giant’s upcoming press conference on October 4. Digital Trends will be reporting live from Google’s campus then, so stay tuned.

Google has rolled out a new mobile application that it describes as a personalized vacation planner for people too pressed for time to do it on their own. Google Trips is available for immediate download on Android and iOS-based mobile devices and can help users plan daily activities while on vacation, even when they are not connected to the Internet. The mobile app offers a wide variety of daily plans for 200 popular destinations around the world. Travelers can use Google Trips to build personalized tours of popular attractions and historical sites in each of these cities. They can also use it to find things to do and places to eat and to make dining and other reservations. In addition, the application lets users choose from multiple day plans pre-assembled from the feedback of other travelers. "Everyone has different interests and time constraints," Stefan Frank, product manager of the new app, said on Google's Official Blog. "No matter how popular an itinerary is, there's no one-size-fits-all solution for the perfect day or the perfect trip." Google Trips offers a way around this by helping travelers figure out places to visit and things to do based on their specific interest and time constraints, according to Frank. For instance, a traveler wishing to visit a specific attraction can enter that location in Google Trips to immediately get a map view of all the other attractions and things to do in the area. Users can specify how much time they have available to visit attractions and whether they want a half-day plan or a plan for an entire day. The application then automatically plans the day for the user starting with their original destination and offering suggestions for other places to visit or things to do in the available time. A "magic wand" feature lets the user add new spots and get a new itinerary with updated information on nearby attractions. Google Trips offers a single location for users to keep track of their flight, hotel and other reservations, organized by individual trips. The application is designed to work without the Internet so users can plan their itineraries and stay on top of their schedules even when they are offline, according to Google. Users simply have to download and save each trip to have it available even when offline The application, according to Google, is designed to help alleviate the stress that travelers often encounter when planning a vacation or a getaway.  In his blog post, Frank pointed to a recent survey by GoodThink in which 74 percent of the respondents pointed to trip planning as the most stressful aspect of a vacation. Respondents cited factors like travel uncertainty, figuring out what things to do on a trip, unfamiliarity with the location and transportation as being major contributors to stress while vacationing. Figuring out how to squeeze everything that you want to do in a vacation within the available time can turn an enjoyable experience into a lot of work, Frank said. "We wanted to reduce the hassle and help travelers enjoy their hard-earned vacations," he said.           LATEST MOBILE ARTICLES   Apple And PayPal Enable Payments Through Siri Voice Commands Revamped Google Play Music to Use Machine Learning to Suggest Songs Google Rebuts EU Complaint About Android Bundling Charges GoPro Recalls All 2,500 of the New Karma Drones Sold to Customers Google Gives Gmail for iOS Major Overhaul                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Check out the intelligent search features on OneDrive 1 by Pradeep  @pradeepviswav Sep 20, 2016 at 21:30 GMT2 months ago Google today announced that they are now using Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Google Drive search on web to find files easier and faster. With this feature, users can type things like “find my budget spreadsheet from last December” or “show me presentations from Anissa.” Drive will understand what you mean and give you the option to click for those specific search results. Many OneDrive users would love to have this feature too. The good news is that Microsoft added similar search feature in OneDrive back in January 2015. Try similar queries on your OneDrive, you will get the search results you expect. Apart from these type of queries, OneDrive also allows you to search for Office documents and PDFs by text inside of them and photos based on time, location, or text that is extracted from images themselves. You can also search for photos based on tags – both ones you manually created and ones that we’ve automatically identified. OneDrive can now automatically recognize content in your photos based purely on the visuals. OneDrive users will have access to automatically grouped collections of photos and they can easily search for specific ones. You’ll be able to quickly find things such as “people,” “dogs,” “whiteboard,” “beach,” “sunsets,” and dozens of other terms. From the new Tags view, you’ll be able to see your top tags – including both manually and automatically-generated ones. And what shows up today is really just the start. I would like to see Microsoft add search suggestions and spell correction in OneDrive. For example, if I search for “Buget document” instead of document’s actual name “Budget document”, OneDrive should ask me whether I meant “Budget Document”. Do you use the search feature on OneDrive? Are you happy with the current search features on OneDrive? Let us know your thoughts in the comments section below. Some links in the article may not be viewable as you are using an AdBlocker.

Photo / Getty Images A few days ago I received some helpful ideas on how to market a business locally. I received these ideas from Rebecca Caroe the Founder and CEO of Creative Agency Secrets. I liked what Rebecca had to say about how to market a business locally and she has kindly allowed me to share her ideas with you. Let me now hand you over to Rebecca for 12 marketing strategies you can use to grow and scale a local business.. Twelve top tactics for local marketing: Knowing how to get known locally is an age old skill but today requires a digital "twist" that can support your traditional activities. Here's my list of tools for you to use in support of local marketing: 1. Set up a Google My Business account and get it address-verified (they post you a code). This allows search results to display detailed information about your business, to link your other Google-owned assets like YouTube, Analytics and AdWords and provide a verified uniform display of all your locations. 2. Key words - ensure city/ town / suburb / state or county are all included in meta data on your site, in your page copy and relevant blog posts. Particularly important if you have case studies and you can say "Tauranga Plumber" or "Avondale Dressmaker". As it further reinforces the areas you work in and brands you're associated with. 3. Directory listings - Get yourself listed on a varity of free and paid sites. Continued below.

This is worthwhile because there are over 30 listings sites for New Zealand alone - bet you can't name more than 5 unprompted! 4. Use Facebook local targeting for advertising and brand building. The unbelievably detailed targeting available through Facebook is a gift for all of us. We can focus our message so tightly that spend is controlled and delivered to only the right people. As a marketer, this is a gift which you must use. Either learn how to do it yourself or hire the talent to set it up and teach you how to use it. Many of our clients like us to tutor them in these techniques before taking over the management ongoing. 5. Set up Google Alerts for key phrases in the news that could allow you to comment add new prospective contacts and build a mailing list. 6. Join the local Business Associations and contact all the relevant local business members so they know about you. In Auckland, these are free to join for ratepayers - but even if the cost is low, it's an investment worth having. You meet people who are inclined to use networking and that's a benefit in itself. Also most associations have mailing lists which you can access when you're a member. 7. Go to Networking events such as BNI, Chamber of Commerce, Meetup.com, Eventbrite are all good places to find groups to test out. 8. Get happy customers to write Testimonials on Google My Business. Also reproduce them on your website. I like to recommend a short two-sentence version plus a longer version which you can use as a case study article or newsletter piece. 9. Use Media relations to get articles in local newspaper, local radio, local newsletters, Neighbourly and don't forget to check out Yahoo Groups for local lists. 10. Ask for Referrals - by sending two business cards with your invoice. My favourite is to leverage first meeting discussions that don't seem to immediately lead to new work - make something from the time you've invested by asking for introductions. 11. Make specific requests for Social sharing via your accounts on Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram and Twitter. When there's something important to say, call in a few favours and get that update on-shared by your friends and contacts. It's easier than you may think. 12. Surprise and delight the customer - e.g. pay it forward - can you think of a way to involve a charity, or give a surprise gift to a deserving individual and use that for publicity? Here's how we involved charity, StarJam, in getting testimonials from clients. The key is to get value from both online and offline marketing spend and the cross-overs are increasingly beneficial when focused on local marketing. Thanks Rebecca for some helpful reminders on what you can do to market your business locally. (I trust you found her comments were useful.) "Good marketing makes the company look smart. Great marketing makes the customer feel smart." - Joe Chernov Action Exercise: Take a look at the 12 tips that Rebecca shares in this article. Put at least two of them into action this week.

Photo / 123RF Google Calendar Secrets Part 2: Last week I covered four clever ways to use a few of the hidden features of Google Calendar for sharing your calendar for work and home. Read it here. Now let's look at a few of the lovely productivity boosts you can enact. 1. Personal and work calendars As mentioned last week, you can create multiple Google calendars and these in turn can be private or public. You might want to create one for personal appointments, birthdays and events to separate them from your work calendar. You can have both - or more showing simultaneously. To create a new calendar, click the little arrow next to "My calendars," and you'll see an option to "Create new calendar." Select that, choose your desired calendar options. 2. Color Code Your Calendars Now that you have more than one calendar, you'll want to easily identify events between your different calendars. To set the default text colour color, hover over the calendar name > click the drop-down arrow > select the color you want. 3. Email Yourself a Daily Agenda You can receive a daily reminder (at 5am) of your day's events and appointments. To enable the reminder it's in Settings > Calendars click Edit notifications next to the calendar you'd like an email notification from > scroll down and check the box next to Daily Agenda. Make sure you click Save to confirm. Continued below. Related Content Debbie Mayo-Smith: Get more sales with this simple action Debbie Mayo-Smith: Is your marketing dumb, lazy and wasteful? Debbie Mayo-Smith: How you can reap rich rewards 4. Enable Offline Access You might not know that many of Google's apps work offline in Chrome. You'll need to manually activate the feature so that Chrome knows to cache the relevant data when you don't have an internet connection. Go to settings > Offline. You'll need to install the Chrome app (which only works in Chrome of course). 5. Find the Best Times to Meet Aligning your schedule with others for meetings is often a pain. Once you create an event, go into the details. Click the "Find a time" tab and add any guests who you want to include. They'll need to make sure they share their calendar with you, then you'll see their appointments right alongside yours and you can choose the time that works for everyone. 6. Change your view Control the way your calendar is displayed. Of course you can have it show the day, week, or month. But you probably didn't know that you can click and drag the dates you want to see in the month box (upper-left corner). This is especially useful for showing the last week of a month and the first week of the next month (something you can't do with the default choices). 7. Activate the Lab! Lab features are hidden until you find and activate them. Some are useful, so it's worth checking them out. Settings>labs. For example there is the Jump to date. This is a box that allows you to quickly go to dates in the future or past. - NZ Herald Debbie Mayo-Smith aka Ms Effective, gives speeches, seminars and trains on sales and personal productivity.

The newspaper said it would work with Jigsaw, a technology incubator at Alphabet, to improve and expand its comments section. The move comes amid frustration at many media organizations which have been seeking to boost reader engagement without allowing abusive and offensive comments. The New York Times will work with Jigsaw, a technology incubator at Alphabet, to improve and expand its comments section ©Mario Tama (Getty/AFP/File) "Maintaining a civil and thoughtful comments section is no easy undertaking, as evidenced by the number of publishers who have shut down their comment capabilities in recent years," said Kinsey Wilson, the editor for innovation and strategy at the Times. "But the Times has been and will continue to be dedicated to providing our readers with a safe online community to discuss the most important issues." Currently, the prestigious daily employes a team of 14 moderators who manually review some 11,000 comments each day. Only about 10 percent of Times articles are open to comments because of the time required for review. Jigsaw uses algorithms to help this process, based on the moderated comments in the newspaper's archives. The open-source system will also be made available to other online publishers, according to the statement. "We believe open sourcing nearly a decade of Times comment archives will benefit the entire journalism industry and potentially make it easier for other publishers to manage comments on their sites," Wilson said. The Times "hopes that the project will expand viewpoints, provide a safe platform for diverse communities to have diverse discussions and allow readers' voices to be an integral part of nearly every piece of reporting," according to a Times statement.

CDT September 20, 2016 George and Amal Clooney are teaming up with Google to educate Syrian refugee children in Lebanon. (Photo: Vincenzo Pinto, AFP/Getty) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST SAN FRANCISCO — George and Amal Clooney are launching an ambitious initiative to educate Syrian refugee children in Lebanon — and they are getting started with a big injection of cash and brain power from Google. The Internet giant's philanthropic arm Google.org is donating $1 million to the Clooney Foundation for Justice — one of 51 philanthropic efforts from companies around the world announced as President Obama convenes a meeting of world leaders at the United Nations on the refugee crisis. The White House says corporate commitments for refugee relief total $650 million and will provide employment opportunities for 220,000 refugees and education for 80,000 refugees. With Google's help, the Clooneys want to help the more than 250,000 children — about half of the school-age children in Lebanon — who are not in school. Some have never seen the inside of a classroom. "That leads to a horrible outcome a decade from now, a generation from now," George Clooney told USA TODAY. "Let's not lose an entire generation of people because they happened to be born in the wrong place at the wrong time." The Clooneys' goal: By next September to enroll 10,000 refugee children in pop-up schools that teach them everything from math to human rights to computer coding — all in English. By 2018, they want to enroll 50,000 more. The movie star-turned-activist and his Lebanon-born, London-raised human rights lawyer wife are using their celebrity to turn the spotlight on one of the world's deadliest battlefields and its young collateral damage. Countries that welcomed Syrian refugees such as Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey don't have the vast resources needed to educate them. The Clooneys say they are starting in Lebanon because of the enormity of the challenge there. More than 1.5 million Syrians have relocated to Lebanon since the 2011 uprising against Bashar al-Assad, making the tiny country the largest host of refugees per capita in the world. That has led to an education gap. In 2009, 94% of Syrian children were in school, according to the United Nations. Today just four out of 10 Syrian refugee children in Lebanon are enrolled in primary and secondary schools. "We want to get every single out-of-school child in Lebanon an education," Amal Clooney told USA TODAY. "My own family left Lebanon when there was a war there, and I couldn't have done any of the work I have done without having been able to have an education." The Clooney Foundation for Justice is working with global education provider SABIS, which has already had success teaching refugee kids in a school in Lebanon. "We learned about a specific school they built in Mtein in the El Mten region of Lebanon," Amal Clooney said. "We started thinking about how do we use this model and make it work at a much bigger scale." Temporary schools that use technology in the classroom will be set up in areas with a high concentration of refugee children, said Carl Bistany, president of SABIS. "The plan is to launch up to 10 schools as close as possible to the communities with the highest need in September 2017," he said. The Clooneys called on Google as its tech partner. (Other partners in the initiative are Virgin Unite and The Radcliffe Foundation.) "They were a natural partner for us. And, yes, they were very generous," George Clooney said. "But it's their tech support and their ideas about that are going to make the difference for us." Google.org dedicates 1% of Google profits and a significant chunk of its employees' time to challenges it believes it's uniquely qualified to address. That includes the refugee crisis. A year ago, Google launched its first global matching campaign, raising $11 million from some 330,00 donors for refugee relief organizations in 48 hours by putting an ad on its home page. In all, Google says it has committed more than $16.5 million to refugee relief and 90 employees have put in more than 1,200 hours on relief projects such as installing Wi-Fi along refugee migration routes. Google.org director Jacquelline Fuller says Google will dispatch employees to make sure Syrian refugee children get a first-rate education. "Access to learning and access to information is so much a core part of our values," Fuller said. "The idea that you would have a quarter million refugee children in a place like Lebanon with half of them not in school, that is an entire generation who could be contributing  to society. This is a cohort of children we need to invest in."

Resend activation e-mail Law & Disorder / Civilization & Discontents Google antitrust deadline on EU’s Android charges extended once again Ad giant needed more time to prepare its defence—now has until October 7 to respond. by Jennifer Baker - Sep 20, 2016 9:45 am UTC Login to bookmark Brussels' competition commissioner Margarethe Vestager. John Thys/AFP/Getty Images BRUSSELS—Google has been given yet another extension in its deadline to respond to European Commission charges that it abused Android's dominance to block competitors. A so-called Statement of Objections was filed in April setting out the commission’s case against the ad giant. Google had until July 27 to respond. The deadline was then extended to September 7, then again until Tuesday (September 20), following requests from Google. Now that date has been moved again—this time to October 7. A spokesperson at Brussels' competition chief Margrethe Vestager's office told Ars: We confirm that the new deadline set by the commission is 7 October. Google asked for additional time to review the documents in the case file. In line with normal practice, the commission analysed the reasons for the request and granted an extension allowing Google to fully exercise its rights of defence. Google is expected to file thousands of documents going back years in response to allegations that it breached European Union competition law. Sources told Ars that the commission sees nothing to gain in rushing Google into a response. Android is the dominant smartphone operating system in Europe, and Vestager believes that there is evidence Google used that position to force manufacturers to pre-install Google services while locking out competitors. She has the power to fine the search behemoth up to 10 percent of its global turnover—around $7.4 billion—if she finds Google guilty. Vestager is likely to face questions about the case while she is in the US this week. Google also faces antitrust charges with regard to search for favouring its own online shopping service over rivals, and in June the commission hinted that a third investigation, this time into Adwords, was in the offing. These investigations, combined with Vestager’s finding that Apple paid insufficient tax in Ireland for more than a decade, have led to accusations that she is anti-American. Last month Russian authorities fined Google almost £5.25 million (438 million rubles, $6.8 million) in an almost identical case over Android. In a blog post last April Google defended its position saying: "The European Commission has been investigating our approach, and issued a Statement of Objections, raising questions about its impact on competition. We take these concerns seriously, but we also believe that our business model keeps manufacturers’ costs low and their flexibility high, while giving consumers unprecedented control of their mobile devices. That’s how we designed the model." Expand full story Reader comments You must login or create an account to comment.

Hawkins@andyjayhawk Sep 20, 2016, 4:22pm EDT share tweet Linkedin Uber Today, the federal government released major new guidelines for self-driving cars. But for anyone waiting for the reaction of big companies like Google and Uber, don’t hold your breath. The chief lobbyist for those companies just convened a press call with reporters in which he said... well, not that much. Within the 114-page document released by the Department of Transportation was a requirement for auto makers and tech companies working on autonomous technology to share large amounts of data with the government on aspects like safety and software. The reaction from the industry has thus far been fairly muted. David Strickland, general counsel of the Self-Driving Coalition For Safer Streets, which represents Google, Uber, Ford, Lyft, and Volvo, declined to comment specifically on the data sharing requirements, saying that his group would submit a detailed response sometime during the 60-day public comment period for the guidelines. All he would allow is that "the devil is in the details." "the devil is in the details" "Data is going to be incredibly important to this process," Strickland said. "There is competitor data, there’s confidential business information, there’s a number of aspects which have to be respected. But on the other hand, safety is a number one priority, and figuring out the right context and space that we can ensure that while protecting the data rights and frankly the property of all the innovators and manufacturers should be properly balanced and that’s going to take some time." In other words, the self-driving car industry, which includes some of the world’s biggest tech and auto companies, aren’t ready to endorse the White House’s new rulebook quite yet. Strickland, who used to run the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, was broadly positive about the guidelines in so far as they amounted to a huge thumbs-up from one of the biggest stakeholders around: the federal government. But he made it clear that the document released today was not seen as the final word from his clients’ point of view. A number of critics of the self-driving car industry have reacted positively to the new guidelines. Joan Claybrook, also former administrator of NHTSA, said she was "pleased" that regulators have got the conversation started, but warned against being pushed around by the industry. "It’s not a secret, cozy process with the manufacturers" "The manufacturers always complain about new federal protections, but autonomous cars are a whole new technology with great promise but also with the potential for serious public harm," Claybrook said. Consumer Watchdog, which has loudly opposed those vehicles it derisively refers to as "robot cars," eagerly claimed victory with the release of the federal guidelines. "This isn’t the checkered flag to industry to irresponsibly develop robot cars that we had feared," John Simpson, the group’s privacy director, said in a statement. "It’s not a secret, cozy process with the manufacturers, but includes a real commitment to transparency and public involvement." The Obama administration has made it clear that it intends to take a light touch in regulating an industry it sees as a crucial player in the future of transportation. How the feds react to the formal reaction from Strickland and his group may say more about how this process unfolds than anything else.

Thankfully, Google is seeking to help solve that problem – at least for Google Drive users. Starting today, the Google Drive search bar on the web app can use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to help you find documents. For example, searching “show me presentations from last year” brings up all your documents modified in last year with a presentation file type.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo 1/2 left right European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager holds a news conference at the EU Commission headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, July 14, 2016. REUTERS/Francois Lenoir 2/2 BRUSSELS Alphabet's Google has been given an extra three weeks to respond to EU antitrust charges that it abused its dominant Android mobile operating system to squeeze out rivals, the European Commission said on Tuesday. The U.S. tech giant had been due to file a response by Tuesday but said it needed more time and will now reply by Oct. 7, a Commission spokesman said, the third extension of the deadline. The Commission in April accused Google of harming consumers because it required mobile phone makers to pre-install Google Search and the Google Chrome browser on their smartphones to access other Google apps. "We confirm that the new deadline set by the Commission is Oct. 7," a Commission spokesman said. "Google asked for additional time to review the documents in the case file." The world's most popular Internet search engine has also asked and been granted an extension to Oct. 13 to reply to a separate charge of favoring its shopping service over rival services in Internet search results. It has until Oct. 5 to respond to a third accusation of blocking competitors in online search advertising. Google, which could be fined up to $7.4 billion or 10 percent of its global turnover for each charge and forced to change its business practices if found guilty of breaching EU rules, has previously deny any wrongdoing.

Here’s how Want access to the best new Google Chromecast features first? Here’s how by Chris Smith 20 September 2016 0 shares Read Comments Google has announced a new Google Chromecast preview program, which will enable users to trial the newest features before they’re publicly released. In a post on its support page, Google say it’ll give users a “sneak peak” at the new features before being rolled out to all. Chromecast owners can enroll their current device via the Cast app for iOS and Android. It’s simply a case of tapping ‘Devices,’ tab selecting the Chromecast model and accessing Device Settings via the menu icon. If slots are open users will see a Preview Program and the option to join. They’ll also be able to choose to receive email notifications when new updates are pushed to the device. Related: Chromecast 4K - What is it and when will it launch? Making the announcement, Google said: “The Chromecast Preview Program is a user opt-in channel that updates your Chromecast device with the latest version of Chromecast’s firmware before it is made broadly available. This gives members of the program early access to features and improvements on their Chromecast. It's an exciting way to get a sneak peek at the latest and greatest updates - and tell us what you think.” The preview program is available for the first and second-gen Chromecast as well as the Chromecast Audio dongles. Google is rumored to be announcing a new 4K-enabled Chromecast device at its event on October 4, where the new Pixel phones will be revealed. Video: Should you buy a 4K TV right now?

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   Google tweets out ‘October is coming’ to drum up event enthusiasm By Rex Crum / September 20, 2016 at 11:04 AM Well, I guess Apple isn’t the only company that can stir up enthusiasm for something new by courting attention with a minimalistic-looking announcement about an upcoming, likely product-related event. Right, Google? In case you missed it…Late Monday, Google tweeted out that “October is coming” (Fans of the Emmy-award winning HBO program “Game of Thrones” and its famous “Winter is coming’ slogan can roll their eyes now.) with a video showing the outline of what looks like the Google search space that then transforms in to a rectangle and, by the time the video ends 30 seconds later, has taken the shape of what we have to believe is a smartphone. The video then shows the Oct. 4 date and the Google logo. All of this is set to a snippet of the song “Come and Get Your Love” by Redbone. October is coming. #madebygooglehttps://t.co/UNMr2cJXhkpic.twitter.com/LzyswaEBjh — Google (@google) September 20, 2016   As the tweet ends, there is a link to click on for someone to receive information on “devices from Google and all the things you can do with them.” So, what does Google have in mind? Well, it sure sounds like something hardware-related. Google did mention “devices,” after all. Speculation is that Google is about to unveil some sort of new line of smartphones, presumably under the name of Pixel. Google hasn’t said anything more about what it has planned, but let’s get real. Never mind October. Christmas is coming (There we go with the “GoT” reference again), and it makes sense for the company to get some new smartphones out on the shelves in time to stoke enthusiasm for shoppers who will soon be looking for things to stick into stockings and under trees at the end of year. And with Apple already selling its new iPhone 7 smartphones, it would behoove Google to have something new and shiny to appeal to the attention of consumers when the end-of-the-year holiday shopping season kicks into full gear. The event will be held at San Francisco’s Ghirardelli Square and streamed live on YouTube. Photo: Google headquarters in Mountain View.

Google is rolling out Natural Language Processing (NLP) worldwide and immediately so that people can search Drive in the same manner as they search the internet. With over 240 million users of Google Drive (as of 2014), even small changes have a big impact on productivity. "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a fancy way of saying “search like you talk,” said Josh Smith, the Product manager for Google Drive, in a blog announcement. "You can type things like “find my budget spreadsheet from last December” or “show me presentations from Anissa.” Drive will understand what you mean and give you the option to click for those specific search results. Drive NLP will get better with each query — so keep on searching." Google has also added spelling correction to Google Drive searches, also something very familiar in Google search. "When you're trying to find a doc fast, it's easy for typos to slip into your search," Smith says. "Drive now has a new autocorrect feature that suggests corrections to misspelled search terms — which can really help when your brain is moving faster than your fingers." Josh Smith says that Google additionally added a couple of small features to Google Doc: You can now easily split your document into multiple columns in Docs. Just choose “Columns” in the “Format” drop-down menu when you need more formatting options to get your point across. We know that work happens in all types of file formats. So, when you open, convert and edit non-Google files in Docs, Sheets and Slides, we’ll now save a copy for you. Just view or download the non-Google source file in its original format directly from Revision History in Docs, Sheets and Slides on the web.

Netizens said that the structures on Itu Aba might be anti-air gun turrets, while others said the defense ministry and coast guard should not withhold details By Aaron Tu, Yau Yueh-hung, Lu Yi-hsuan and Jake Chung / Staff reporter, with staff writer Ongoing talks with Google Inc are being carried out to handle Google Earth imagery potentially leaking military secrets, the Ministry of National Defense said yesterday. Four three-pronged structures were visible on the northwestern coast of Itu Aba Island （Taiping Island, 太平島） after the imagery was updated in July, but the ministry and the Coast Guard Administration have not commented on their nature. Previous Google Earth images showed that the structures were not there in January last year. The coast guard, which is in charge of Itu Aba, said that all structures and facilities on the island are classified and their functions could not be made known. Satellite images on Google Earth show four structures on a claw-shaped base, with two of the four above the tideline, while all four structures have a dome-shaped object atop them. A source said that as a new harbor on Itu Aba was completed at the end of last year, it was possible that the ministry supervised construction of the structures and forbade coast guard personnel from entering the area. The structures are much larger than artillery bases that have been removed from the island, the source said. Chinese Nationalist Party （KMT） Legislator Johnny Chiang （江啟臣） took photographs of the structures during a visit to the island in July, which showed they stood at least two stories high and were evidently not a giant surf break. Ministry spokesman Chen Chung-chi （陳中吉） yesterday said that the facilities were classified and the ministry would not comment on the issue. Minister of National Defense Feng Shih-kuan （馮世寬） said that while facilities and their functions on Itu Aba are classified, the public should rest assured that the island has strong defenses. Coast Guard Director-General Lee Chung-wei （李仲威） said that details about the facility were classified and the administration had notified Google of the issue after KMT Legislator Alicia Wang （王育敏） asked Premier Lin Chuan （林全） whether the imagery on Google Earth could be used to discern what functions the facility had. Netizens criticized the ministry and the coast guard’s reluctance to speak on the issue and said there are hundreds of satellites that could evidently see the structures, while others claiming to be “military experts” said the structures resembled anti-air gun turrets. In other developments, the ministry denied reports that the Yun Feng missile program, a mid-range cruise missile developed by the state-run Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology, had been terminated by the administration of President Tsai Ing-wen （蔡英文）. The “Cloud Peak” missile program was said to be capable of hitting Beijing and Shanghai, with a range of more than 1,000km. When asked whether the Tsai administration would terminate weapon systems capable of cross-strait strikes, Chen said that the ministry would outline its plans in January next year after it finalizes its strategic planning. 新聞來源：TAIPEI TIMES 廣告 Four three-pronged structures on the northwestern coast of Itu Aba Island （Taiping Island） in the South China Sea are shown in an aerial surveillance photograph from Google Earth. Photo: screengrab from Google Earth 自由電子報 APP 全新上線 iOS Android 看更多！請加入自由時報粉絲團 | 焦點‧本日最多瀏覽 » 更多焦點新聞 中國釋法後… 香港高院撤銷2議員資格 冷眼集》民主是個屁嗎？ 赴ＡＰＥＣ將晤多國領袖 宋︰挑戰與使命 社論》「台灣川普」？ 人大釋法》外媒：重創香港自治與司法獨立 府籲中國正面看待港民理念 香港兩議員資格遭撤銷》立委：更激發港人反中共霸權 蔡總統︰台灣會是東協最可靠夥伴 吳叡人：一國兩制正式死亡 爭香港未來 梁頌恆 游蕙禎上訴到底 網友回應 熱門新聞 侍JAPAN壯行試合 大王vs.大谷 色誘仇家遇查緝 山寨張韶涵裸身應門 疑收石油業賄賂 俄經濟部長被拘 割聲帶保命 不戒菸 5年罹5癌 畫趣巡迴終站 生活美學館展童趣 周紘立／軟體動物 張立昂搞大「肌肌」 和邵翔別苗頭 「想不到的角度」 番茄農國家地理攝影大賽奪銀 NBA》灰狼戰績不佳 盧比歐開炮 黑板樹惹人厭 台中將移除六千棵 經典賽》荷蘭不比日本差 韓媒：A組為死亡之組 中國纏訟10年 川普英文商標逆轉勝 投資人展望多艱 歐股震盪收黑 苗縣府融資平台釋15億 明年月還1.1億 席格、富爾默 大聯盟新人王 《快樂上班族》幫助別人也等於幫助自己 澎湖跨海大橋 議員爭取改建 艾迪瑞德曼 闖魔法世界雪恥 案發地川普碧湖 巧妙預言川普必胡 網路直播投票拚人氣 郭董+小英竟輸這個人 「酷玩」明年4月來台 桃園開唱全搖滾區 環保署借鏡新北市 推動「村里資收站建置計畫」 單週最佳球員》「小胖」變犀利 一槍斃命夠狠 王若琳自認不討喜 對瑪莎心懷感激 彭双浪︰面板Q4是暖冬 榮景持續到明年上半年 校樹風倒 賓中技藝班刨製泡茶桌椅 菸葉廠成歷史建築 仍季節性使用 一夜掃光32噸馬鈴薯 中國民眾助老翁回家 南台灣優質冠軍米 農糧署南區分署邀民眾多吃 國研院衛星展 學童大開眼界 陳家帶／論秋天 海碩盃／張凱貞開喜 期待今合拍佳容 平愛梨遭爆婚前憂鬱症劈腿 嘉縣建動保園區 1128萬元預算保留 竹北擬蓋停車場 市代疑評估錯誤 Coach秋季男裝 陽岱鋼帥氣賞貨─火箭毛衣實用後背包 列入願望清單 傑米道南披白袍 《第9條命》玩偷情 房仲現倒店潮？ 北市府提數據反駁 噪音大、動線差 台中新站待改善 【愛讀書】 《鬼計》 快艇「衝最快10勝」 變身「艇王」 鄉民幻想郭董當總統 「一例一休變全年無休」 少年相約烏來泡溫泉 路邊被砍血跡蔓延百公尺 里長怨大巨蛋復工進度不明 柯P：等台建中心 白人的球鞋？NB副總裁公開挺川普 引爆焚鞋潮 寓教於樂親子遊─日本東京、川越行 近代人文萌發 國圖辦蔣渭水特展 被爆假公益真投資 王雪紅告獨立記者 〈家庭診療室〉先生跳國標舞 介意他和女伴接觸 編輯推薦 工業用碳酸鈉浸泡 彰化再現黑心海帶 虐女嬰致死案 狠母、情夫收押禁見 大福彩、大福獎摃龜！ 今彩539頭獎開出4注 明北台灣高溫30度 中南部留意空汙 蔡英文：千萬不要以為能安然做4年 勞基法修法公聽會爆衝突 勞團抗議後不歡而散 紐時爆：美部份安卓手機 將用戶資訊傳中國 自由體育more » NBA》灰狼戰績不佳 盧比歐開炮 經典賽》荷蘭不比日本差 韓媒：A組為死亡之組 海碩盃》新世代李亞軒／徐竫雯喜開胡 雙打8強卡位 NBA》湯普森將被交易？總教練柯爾這樣說 海碩盃》莊佳容／張凱貞旗開得勝 直落2晉雙打8強 自由娛樂more » 才娶走小7歲女友 男星被爆強吻肉彈人妻 Gigi、史丹利不想生 再被催生就結紮 接機粉絲注意！ Apink明早撲台啦 方順吉感嘆當年難敵誘惑 不讓十歲帥兒當童星 紅痘爛臉out！柯震東瀏海耍萌 逆轉崩壞顏值 自由評論網more » 恭喜美國要見壞人了！ 關家良一的每月叮嚀 港人應立馬發動向川普求援！ 青年版的新南向政策 「台灣川普」？ 贊助商廣告 iStyle頻道more » 42歲仍是骨感美人！貝嫂：要瘦就這樣吃 強國女星94狂！出入機場竟扮長腿巧克力？ 脂肪不見了！營養師點名四季最該吃的水果 忽冷忽熱衣服怎麼穿？全智賢這招太神啦！ 國外網站點名！台灣8大失戀療傷聖地是... 3C頻道more » 瑪利歐要來了！iPhone 這天可以下載 生活更便利！Android手機必改的設定 Macbook Pro 根本電競筆電？原因是？ Google翻譯開竅？為保流暢不再逐字翻 iPhone7過熱？澳洲婦遭手機嚴重燙傷！ 汽車頻道more » Mazda CX-5二代發表 內外設計更氣派 三星如何入侵你的愛車 這圖一看就懂 新一代馬路殺手 高齡駕駛有話要說 VW 要推出全新 SUV 角逐小型跨界休旅 美調查：密西西比州竟是最易致命的地區 便當菜‧蒟蒻牛肉燒 泰式炒河粉 自製提鮮調味品 家務清潔「粉」輕鬆 轉寄 標題：《TAIPEI TIMES 焦點》 Ministry talking to Google about island ‘secret’ leaks *收件人 Email  如果要寄多個email，請用「;」分開，最多10個email 你的姓名  *你的 Email  訊息  驗證碼   驗證碼有大小寫之分   2016年11月17日‧星期四‧丙申年十月十八日 近期網友關注 瀏覽記錄 1為「爺孫戀」一夕白髮...林靖恩父怒轟李坤城 2強震讓大量黑鮑上岸 紐西蘭漁民竟這麼做！ 3控訴國安局過河拆橋 骨感妹與陳彥伯婚外情竟是任務？ 4博多天坑消失了！該路段今晨已恢復通車 5史上最瞎A片開場 網友：我到底看了什麼... 更多關注新聞 市場動態 華泰名品城打造桃園最大聖誕村 超狂！透明粉撲大逆襲！ 三種大曲喝法 激推入甕陳年 更多市場動態 » 新聞查詢：關鍵字 | 昔日新聞 熱門關鍵字 版權所有 不得轉載 © 2016 The Liberty Times.

Join the Conversation To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs Mapping a new course with smartphone apps George Avalos, The Mercury News 3:08 p.m. EDT September 20, 2016 San Jose, Calif. — When it comes to map apps, consumers are finding plenty of fresh paths to digital navigation thanks to Google, Apple and a whole host of rivals. Here WeGo, Waze, MapFactor, Mapquest, Scout GPS, Maps.Me and InRoute are just some of the apps that are challenging Google Maps and Apple Maps, which dominate smartphone mapping services, by focusing on new and novel features. Google and Apple, though, aren’t content to stay in the slow lane of innovation. Both have added new features to their map apps in recent months, including enabling users to add interim destinations to go along with the ultimate stop on a trip. Google’s changes rolled out in an update to Google Maps this summer; Apple’s changes will be included in iOS 10, the soon-to-be released next version of its mobile operating system. “Just open the app, enter a destination, tap the corner menu, and then click add a stop,” Google says in a blog post. “To rearrange the order of your stops, tap and hold the three-dot menu to the left of Add Stop and drag it to the position you want.” The Apple Maps service has new features that seek to meld activities and services associated with a trip. “Apps like OpenTable can integrate bookings right into Maps,” Apple says on its website. “Services like Uber and Lyft can make it easier for users to book a ride, without ever leaving the Maps app.” And while this navigational arms race shifts into high gear, it’s become apparent the original stand-alone GPS devices are becoming stranded by the side of the road. The proliferation of smartphone apps has reshaped a market once dominated by the stand-alone machines, such as TomTom, Garmin and Magellan. According to market research firm Berg Insight, worldwide shipments of personal navigation devices has decreased from 40 million units in 2008 to a projected 11 million by the end of this year. That number is expected to drop to just 7 million in 2019 — less than a tenth of projected smartphone map app users in that year. “Most consumers are using their smartphones as their primary navigation and map system,” said Ben Bajarin, an analyst with Creative Strategies, a market researcher. “Retailers, in a lot of cases, don’t really promote the stand-alone devices any more.” The established map apps from Google and Apple offer a wide array of features, with the centerpiece being turn-by-turn navigation. And while the emerging apps also typically offer turn-based directions, they all attempt to offer niche features that also can go beyond the basics of the apps from the tech titans. Google-owned Waze, whose service is separate from Google Maps, emphasizes the social aspects of traveling, and its new features include improved ways to share your estimated time of arrival with others. It also provides quick access to frequent destinations. Other apps also seek to meld the drive with other services. Scout GPS emphasizes social interaction, including the ability to message friends and family and share your location or destination with designated people. Here WeGo allows you to summon taxicabs or access a ride-hailing service. InRoute, designed mainly for long road trips, offers the ability to add numerous stops — and drivers can easily select routes that avoid areas with hot temperatures or hilly terrain. Saying it makes “cities easier to use,” Citymapper is geared to the daily commuter. In addition to vehicle navigation, the app has found a way to coordinate public transit and ride-hailing services so people can plan integrated trips. Experts predict the pace of innovation will pick up even more for map apps. They might start taking note of what types of restaurants you visit and only suggest those when you’re looking for a place to eat. “The unique personalization of mapping is the next step,” said Rob Enderle, an Oregon-based analyst who tracks the tech sector. “We are on that cusp.” 3 CONNECTTWEET 4 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://detne.ws/2dhgt1S TOP VIDEOS Pistons owner Tom Gores discusses possible move downtown 5:50 Tom Izzo on Dan Gilbert's $15 Million gift to MSU 2:14 ZF TRW automotive demonstrates self-driving technology 1:57 Building Mars spaceship parts in Metro Detroit 1:38 Tour the Detroit riverfront's industrial heart 2:27 Hamtramck’s Bon Bon Bon crafts artisan chocolates 3:55 Tomorrow's doctors have fun at the Little Medical School 0:39 New housing, retail development in New Center breaks ground 2:48 Henry Payne goes 0 to 60 in the Porsche Boxster-Cayman 2:01 Open Streets in Detroit 1:47

Their actual names are (almost) nowhere to be seen. There are a few reasons why Google might want to do away with the Now branding. For one, it was pretty confusing in the case of Now on Tap. While the name was clever, it wasn't at all descriptive; "screen search" is, boring as it may be. It's all just "Google" now The other, likely bigger component is that Google wants its own name — Google — to be associated with giving you information, no matter what way you receive. So it makes sense that Now is turning into the Google feed and the Google screen search, just as the upcoming Google voice assistant will be called the Google assistant. Google's assistant seemed to be the harbinger of these changes. It's still not clear how assistant will live alongside the feed (FKA Now), but we'll likely find out soon. Google is announcing its next smartphones on October 4th, and it'll certainly want the features out by then.

The little blue dot that shows your current position will now have a cone emanating from it. Why not a simple arrow? The cone can expand or shrink to give you a precise idea of how accurate the current reading is. The wider the cone, the more inaccurate. And with that, Google’s also giving us a ridiculously easy tool to recalibrate your phone on the spot to show more accurate positioning.

[Photo: Irina Lee, Flickr user AIGA/NY] Jason Shen 09.20.16 5:00 AM Last summer I was interviewing for product-manager jobs in New York City. My last job had left me feeling cornered into a specialist role at an enterprise marketing-software firm, and there wasn’t a path for me to grow into or room to move up. So I started putting out feelers. I spoke to startups, big companies, and a few in the middle. The two companies I was most excited to interview at were Google and Etsy. From An Ideal Product Manager . . . I'd heard from friends at Google that the company really looked for product managers with strong technical backgrounds. I already knew my way around basic web development: HTML, CSS, and Javascript, but threw myself into leveling up my skills. I watched videos and took copious notes on how web servers, DNS, and web traffic load-balancing worked, and how databases store and retrieve information. The stuff was pretty dry for me, but I pushed through it, believing it would make me a stronger candidate. I became so focused on giving the "right answer" that when I dialed into the actual phone screens, I was no longer my relaxed, enthusiastic self. I was so focused on giving the "right answer" that when I dialed into the actual phone screens with Google, I was no longer my relaxed, enthusiastic self. Instead, after every product question, I carefully asked for time to "jot down some thoughts." Then, with an interviewer waiting patiently at the end of the line, I quickly attempted to screen out any crazy ideas that came to mind and offered only reasonable ones—which sounded bland and tired the moment they escaped my lips. Over two 45-minute phone interviews, I wasn't asked any questions that actually related to the technical information I'd studied. And worst of all, when I later asked my contact inside Google (who'd referred me for the role) why they'd passed on me, the feedback she said she'd heard was "lack of product insight and depth of answer." Ouch. . . . To An Ideal Me I was frustrated, but I knew I couldn’t give up. I realized that if Google needed a super-technical product manager, that was never going to be me, and trying so hard to fit into what I thought they wanted from me was foolish. As a result, I never even got to show my strong side, which is building rapport with people and coming up with ideas spontaneously. So when I went on to interview at Etsy, I knew I had to wow them, but also be my authentic self. I’m a big reader, so I studied the company, read its S-1 filings prior to its IPO, and looked through press clippings from the past few years. Then created what I like to call a "10x application," building a website called PoweredBySellers.com that conveyed my excitement for Etsy, my analytical abilities, and my technical prowess.

During a whiteboarding exercise where we analyzed a conversion funnel (something I'd never done before), I just grabbed the marker and started thinking out loud and having a conversation with my interviewer. While I may have thrown out some crazy ideas, I was also able to read cues from my interviewer and expand on the ideas he seemed most interested in. I had a blast during the interview process at Etsy, and after I got an offer and accepted it, I found out that one of the biggest reasons why they picked me for the role was that I was clearly enthusiastic and would bring a lot of energy to the team. I’m so glad it worked out—it’s been really great working as a product manager here at Etsy. Three Less-Technical Lessons For Tech Interviews All in all, this experience taught me a few things: Play to your strengths. Your temperament, interests, skills, and knowledge make you uniquely qualified for certain roles and poorly qualified for others. Don’t fight this. Embrace it. Lead the things you’re good at, rather than spending all your time covering weaknesses. Don't get too fixated on yourself. Leading with your strengths doesn’t mean you don’t carefully research the companies where you’re interviewing in order to really get inside their world. Spending time reviewing the industry, product area, geography, and culture of potential employers will go a long way to making them feel like you "get them." Your temperament, interests, skills, and knowledge make you uniquely qualified for certain roles, and poorly qualified for others. Don't fight this. Keep your chin up. Job hunting while holding down a full-time job is grueling work, but remember that it's temporary and that it's still your job to convey a positive attitude when you're actually interviewing—even if you had the worst day ever. If you simply can't project positivity, be honest with yourself about that. You can either change the time of the interview or suck it up go in with a smile anyway. Just remember: Interviewing can often be a stressful, highly scripted experience no matter how you cut it. So being as authentic as possible isn't always easy, but it's key to standing out for the right reasons. I was fortunate enough to learn that the hard way—and still wind up happy with the outcome.

European Union Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager at the Delegation of the European Union to the United States on Monday, September 19, 2016. (Photo: Jarrad Henderson, USA TODAY) 41 CONNECTTWEET 18 LINKEDIN 16 COMMENTEMAILMORE WASHINGTON — Apple likely won't be the last U.S. firm operating in Europe to get a bill for back taxes. The European Union last month ruled that Apple must pay $14.5 billion for unpaid taxes to Ireland. Apple and Ireland both dispute the charge, but Margrethe Vestager, the EU Competition Commissioner who oversees antitrust and competition, remains adamant on the issue. "No government can give a selective advantage to a specific company because that would make competition unfair. That is exactly what we are dealing with here," Vestager said Monday in an interview with USA TODAY. "We find that due to two tax rulings, Apple has received illegal state aid from Ireland in forms of taxes not being paid. And, of course, these taxes have to be paid." USA TODAY Tim Cook on EU tax ruling: 'It is total political crap' The EU continued its tax offensive Monday by announcing an investigation into tax deals that French power company Engie possibly got from EU member country Luxembourg. Amazon, Fiat and McDonalds are currently also under investigation for unfair tax advantages in Luxembourg, and the EU is also probing potential tax advantages given by Belgium to 35 companies including Anheuser-Busch InBev and by the Netherlands to Starbucks. Amazon, Starbucks and other companies have said they received no special tax treatment and plan appeals. Some tax experts surmise that tech giants such as Google, Microsoft and Facebook, each benefitting from highly favorable tax deals in Europe, could be in the EU's top competition regulator's sights, too. "There may be more cases," Vestager said. "They may be European, they may be other nationalities. It’s too early to say." A former member of the Danish Parliament (2001-2014) and minister of economic affairs and the interior, Vestager was named to the EU Commission in 2014. The commission proposes new laws to the European Parliament, enforces those and negotiates international treaties. The tax actions against Apple and antitrust cases waged against Google have earned Vestager and her commission some tough labels in U.S. corporate circles: she's been called U.S. firms'  EU nemesis, and the commission's recent moves have been described as Big Brother-esque. Apple's Tim Cook, not known for his bluntness, called the EU ruling on Apple's Irish taxes "total political crap." USA TODAY Apple-EU tax clash has others asking: Who's next? Vestager takes these critiques in stride and points to the numerous reasons U.S. companies want to do business in the EU, including its highly skilled work forces and customer base. "But the thing is, we would also like to make it clear that you shouldn’t go to Europe to do tax evasion, but straight business," she said. In Washington Monday, Vestager met with administration officials including Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, Federal Trade Commission Chairwoman Edith Ramirez and others in the Justice Department and in Congress. Good, frank discussion with Secretary of the Treasury Jacob Lew on state aid and taxation - amongst other things. pic.twitter.com/Oav9kXG5RX— Margrethe Vestager (@vestager) September 19, 2016 Treasury officials have sharply criticized the EU's move on Apple and Vestager concedes that the U.S. and EU do not "necessarily look at everything the same way." But U.S. and EU officials who oversee antitrust and merger control "are very closely aligned," she said. The FTC has had its own dealings with Google, settling an investigation in 2013 over alleged Web search bias. But the agency is reportedly looking into whether Google abuses the monopoly power of its Android operating system on mobile devices. That's the subject of one of the three separate ongoing investigations the EU has into Google's business practices; the others involve search and advertising. The cases are "about misuse of their dominant position," Vestager said. "We see evidence to support that Google has been promoting itself to be better situated in neighboring markets or to stay most dominant when we go into mobile search." There's no update on when those could close, Vestager said. "Obviously, speed is very important because these are fast moving markets," she said. "But on the other hand, speed can never trump quality because these are very important cases. They have to stand up in court and they have to be very robust. And, of course, due process is a very fundamental value both here and in the European Union." “In a number of the cases, it’s actually U.S. companies complaining about other U.S. companies and the way they do business in Europe,”Margrethe Vestager The genesis of an antitrust investigation is often a complaint from another company, Vestager says. "In a number of the cases, it’s actually U.S. companies complaining about other U.S. companies and the way they do business in Europe." Another area of growing interest for the EU is data collection, as tech companies amass giant databases of consumer information. On behalf of the EU, Germany's Federal Cartel Office is investigating Facebook for possible misuse of data. "Their hypothesis is that Facebook is very dominant in a number of European countries and they find that there is a risk because they are dominant they have made people accept a lower degree of privacy on their personal data," Vestager said. Facebook has said the social network complies with the law in its handling of data. In April, the European Parliament passed new data protection regulations that go into effect in 2018. "It is very important, to have a robust digital economy, that the citizens regain the trust in how their data are being processed and who can access them," she said.

SUBSCRIBE AMP — Accelerated Mobile Pages — begin global rollout in Google mobile search results Google reiterated that the move does not include a rankings change. Greg Sterling on September 20, 2016 at 1:00 pm More In August, Google announced Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) would be moving beyond “Top Stories” into the main organic mobile search results. Today, AMP officially rolls out broadly in mobile search. Rudy Galfi, Google’s lead product manager for AMP, told me that the global rollout would be complete by the end of the year. He reiterated that this does not represent a rankings change. AMP pages won’t get a special boost in mobile results. However, when there are two versions of a page, Google will prefer and link to the AMP version. AMP pages open within the AMP viewer and load much faster than conventional web pages — typically in less than a second. Galfi wouldn’t share specific user-response data but told me, “We’re seeing great user response.” He also said that Google has been “humbled” by the industry’s response and adoption of AMP. There are now more than 600 million AMP-enabled documents, which is apparently up from 150 million this summer. These documents are distributed in more than 230 “locales” and written in more than 100 languages. The list of companies embracing AMP is long, including Bing, WordPress, Reddit, Ebay and Shopify, among numerous other publishers. Google added that AMP documents extend well beyond news content into shopping, cooking, travel, e-commerce and entertainment, among other categories. AMP is an effort to make the web a more mobile-friendly and engaging experience. While mobile web traffic is significant, engagement is not. Most mobile user time is spent in apps. The effort that Google is spearheading on the content side with AMP is conceptually similar to what’s now going on with the Coalition for Better Ads. While they address different issues and challenges, both are geared toward making the mobile web a more compelling place to be.

By Jack Wallen | September 20, 2016, 9:55 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: Jack Wallen Recently I ran into a Google cloud sync issue that had me beating my head against a proverbial brick wall. All in all the issue should have been quite simple to resolve, but alas...it wasn't. Let me set the stage. I use the dev version of Chrome on my elementary OS desktop. I have one Pixel chromebook that uses the dev build (for testing) and one Pixel that uses the stable build (used mostly for writing books). Must-Read Cloud Why there's no compelling use case for hybrid cloud Pokemon Go: How the cloud saved the smash hit game from collapse Switching clouds: What Spotify learned when it swapped AWS for Google's cloud Tech Pro Research: Cloud computing policy I upgraded Chrome on my desktop. That night, I opened my stable Pixel to work on my current book, logged in, and watched the Pixel immediately and automatically log me back out. I tried logging in again—same results. Instinctively, I powerwashed the chromebook, assuming that would solve the issue. The problem continued. I realized I was most likely facing an issue with the bookmarks being synced by the desktop dev build of Chrome and the stable build not wanting to play along. Unfortunately, the stable Pixel wouldn't remain logged in long enough for me to go to Settings | Advanced Sync Settings and disable what I assumed was causing the problem. I was lucky to get about five seconds on the Chrome OS desktop before getting kicked out. Three powerwashes later...no dice. I was surprised that my Pixel running the dev version of Chrome OS wasn't having the same issue. How was I to resolve this problem that rendered my precious Pixel unusable? I found the answer on a Google account page you should bookmark. SEE: 50 must-have Google Chrome extensions (and they're all free) (ZDNet) Chrome Sync Google offers a site that displays every item category you have in sync with Chrome. The page is called, aptly, Chrome Sync. If you go to that page while logged into your Google account, you will see everything you currently have synced to your Google account from any/all associated Chrome browsers. The page will list: Apps Extensions Settings Autofill History Themes Bookmarks Passwords Open Tabs At the bottom of that page is a Reset Sync button. If you click that button, it will clear everything in your Chrome Sync history. This does not remove the items from your desktop or mobile browsers—it only clears the various caches stored on the server. In other words, if you click Reset Sync, all of your bookmarks, extensions, settings, etc. won't vanish from Chrome...only the server. A caveat Say the problem is in your Bookmarks (which I believe was causing the issue for my stable Pixel). If you do not disable Bookmarks from syncing (in Setting | Advanced Sync Settings), the second you click Reset Sync, those bookmarks will begin resyncing to all of your associated devices and that problem (such as the one I had) will continue. To that end, here's what I had to do. Go to all devices running the dev build of Chrome (or Chrome OS). Select Choose What To Sync from Advanced Sync Settings. Uncheck Bookmarks and anything else that might be causing issues (Figure A). Click OK. Powerwash the affected Pixel but do not log in yet. Go to the Chrome Sync page. Click Reset Sync. Wait about five minutes for the cache to clear. Log in to the affected Pixel. Figure A Image: Jack Wallen Disabling the bookmarks sync from the dev build of Chrome. After walking through the above steps, my stable Pixel remained logged in, and I was able to work just fine. Problem solved. Bookmark Chrome Sync The ability to reset your Google cloud sync data will come in handy; in fact, it may be the fastest route to clearing user data from a Google account. If you need to completely refresh your account, powerwash everything, and reset your sync data—it will be like starting over with a clean slate. Keep that Chrome Sync page handy.

And I think this is one of the key things we need to do,” Rep. Bradford Jacobsen of Oxford said after the hearing. “We want to be on the forefront of new technology and keep Michigan … as the auto capital of the world.” (Photo: Jared Wickerham / Associated Press) Lansing — A state House committee approved new versions of legislation that would pave the way for companies to operate autonomous cars on Michigan roads. Now tech companies including Google may be one step closer to operating ride-hailing fleets of driverless cars on the state’s public roads after lawmakers on the House Communications and Technology Committee sent the legislation to the House floor in a 13-0 vote on Tuesday. The Republican committee chairman Rep. Bradford Jacobsen of Oxford said after a Tuesday hearing that the House can now vote on the bills as soon as Wednesday. The Senate previously approved different versions of the legislation earlier in September. While it’s up to the Speaker of the House Kevin Cotter, R-Mt. Pleasant, when the full House votes on the legislation, Jacobsen said he “would not be surprised” if Republican leaders in the House hold a vote Wednesday or Thursday. After that, the Senate would still need to hold a concurrence vote on the new versions of the legislation which Gov. Rick Snyder would also need to approve. “As technology is changing every day, we need to be on top of it. And I think this is one of the key things we need to do,” Jacobsen said after the hearing. “We want to be on the forefront of new technology and keep Michigan … as the auto capital of the world.” Google Inc. is in part responsible for the latest iteration. It came to lawmakers with concerns that the original language in the bills would prevent the company from operating autonomous vehicles in Michigan, which Jacobsen said was not lawmakers’ intent. The company last week asked to alter two of the bills. John Krafcik, CEO of Google’s Self-Driving Car project, said in a letter to the Michigan House Communications and Technology Committee that he was concerned the legislation may prohibit companies from operating autonomous ride-hailing businesses in the state. The substitute versions of the legislation changed some technical language to make sure other companies like Google are allowed to operate autonomous vehicles under the regulatory framework sketched out in the four-bill package. The former versions defined autonomous vehicle manufacturers to have “distributed motor vehicles” in such a way that could have excluded companies such as Google because it does not currently sell vehicles. The legislation outlines a set of standards that a company such as Google must meet to test and operate self-driving vehicles in the state. Companies would need to comply with federal motor vehicle safety standards, have operated the self-driving vehicles with a test driver for at least 1 million miles and obtain insurance, surety bond or proof of self-insurance worth at least $10 million. The legislation has the support of major automakers and suppliers, many House lawmakers and Gov. Snyder. Snyder has said driverless-car testing and operations are crucial for helping Michigan keep its economic edge and remain the automotive capital of the world after years of economic hardship. Michigan is one of seven states that, along with Washington, D.C., have laws allowing testing of autonomous cars, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. California, Florida and Nevada have laws allowing for the “operation” of those cars beyond testing. Jacobsen said he toured the new autonomous vehicles testing site in the works at Willow Run last week with Gov. Rick Snyder and was “very impressed.” mgerstein@detroitnews.com Twitter: @MikeGerstein 6 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 6 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://detne.ws/2cAQcYx TOP VIDEOS Pistons owner Tom Gores discusses possible move downtown 5:50 Tom Izzo on Dan Gilbert's $15 Million gift to MSU 2:14 ZF TRW automotive demonstrates self-driving technology 1:57 Building Mars spaceship parts in Metro Detroit 1:38 Tour the Detroit riverfront's industrial heart 2:27 Hamtramck’s Bon Bon Bon crafts artisan chocolates 3:55 Tomorrow's doctors have fun at the Little Medical School 0:39 New housing, retail development in New Center breaks ground 2:48 Henry Payne goes 0 to 60 in the Porsche Boxster-Cayman 2:01 Open Streets in Detroit 1:47

The feature is now being rolled out around the world with 600 million AMP documents from partners like eBay, Reddit, and WikiHow. When it launched in February, AMP was mostly limited to news article from major publications in a Top Stories carousel. First available on the mobile web, articles can now be found in the Android and iOS Google apps, as well as Google News. Since then, partners like eBay and Pinterest have begun building AMP versions of their sites for quicker load times. AMP sites in search results will be denoted by the same lightning bolt icon. Pages open with a white bar on top that lists the domain and has a close button to the left. Unlike news stories, there is no carousel to quickly swipe between results. Partners include eBay, Reddit, Shopify, and WikiHow in the US. The 600 million AMP documents include pages from 232 locales, 104 languages, and range from retail, travel, recipe, general knowledge, and entertainment. Based on HTML, AMP is an industry effort to speed up and improve mobile web page by creating lighter pages that are still feature rich. Google cites that the average load time of an AMP article is less than one second and uses 10 times less data than a full page.

Mobile More News SEO 20 Sep 16 | Christopher Ratcliff Facebook0 Linkedin91 Google+17 Twitter 108 Update: Google’s Rudy Galfi, Google’s lead product manager for AMP, has revealed to Greg Sterling from Search Engine Land that the global rollout of AMP in mobile organic search would be complete by the end of the year. In further remarks posted on SEL, Galfi clarified that having AMP enabled still wouldn’t affect ranking signals though. Six months ago, Google’s Accelerated Mobile Pages initiative was only available in the ‘Top Stories’ carousel of it search results. Then in August, Google announced that AMP support will be rolled out across the entire organic search results page. In a blog post, Google previewed exactly how this new layout will look. In fact, if you’re currently on a mobile you can just click on the following link for a live demonstration: AMP Demo And it totally works. Here’s my mobile search for ‘finding dory review’. Check out the middle result from The Guardian… As you can see from the above, being AMP enabled doesn’t automatically make a page rank higher, in fact Galfi reiterated today that AMP is not a ranking signal. Google AMP is specifically designed to improve the mobile user experience offering stripped down versions of web pages that load instantly, have minimal navigation, are uncluttered with ads (for now) and require very little network power. Personally I now seek out pages with the little lightning symbol when I’m on my mobile… there’s just no other more satisfying way to find out the lyrics to Will Smith’s ‘Miami’ when on the move. Don’t panic Today’s confirmation is designed to be an early warning (much like its previous ‘head’s up’ regarding its mobile friendly algorithm change) before it rolls out the feature more broadly by the end of the year. Google states: “We want to give everyone who might be interested in “AMPing up” their content enough time to learn how to implement AMP and to see how their content appears in the demo.” Google developing a sense of humour there that can only be described as ‘dad-like’. To date there are more than 150 million AMP docs in Google’s index, with more than 4 million new ones being added every week. You still have time to implement AMP if you haven’t already, but you’d better get your lightning fast skates on!

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Mobile Phones Google Pixel phones coming out on October 4, images leaked Mobile Phones Google Pixel phones coming out on October 4, images leaked By Bindu Nair - Google has officially sent out media invites for an event taking place on October 4 in San Francisco. While there’s no indication of what to expect from the occasion, the company will probably be launching its latest smartphones. Rumors so far indicate that these handsets will be unveiled under the Pixel moniker instead of the Nexus name. The switch is apparently meant to indicate that the new offerings are Google phones rather than just a collaboration between the tech giant and a manufacturer. HTC is supposedly still putting the devices together, but its branding won’t be seen on them. Google’s new teasers for the October 4 event hint at the possibility of such a massive change in its strategy. First-off, it’s released a video which simply depicts a search box that eventually morphs into the shape of a smartphone. Diving into a bit of speculation, it’s feasible that the firm is trying to call back to its roots as a search engine and this handset is meant to be a culmination of its first major success. Also See: Google DeepMind’s AI can realistically mimic human speech The second teaser has been presented in the form of a website. The aforementioned video is played when the page is opened before pictures starts appearing inside the outline of the phone. Notably, the site is called Made by Google. If that’s not enough of a hint, even the brand’s tweet linking to the page contains the term #madebygoogle. The new Pixel and Pixel XL were recently leaked in the form of two images. The photos of its back seem to be pointing towards a metal body with a glass panel adorning the top half of the rear surface. Not much can be gleaned from the snaps of its front. Previous reports claim the former has a 5-inch screen and the latter a 5.5-inch one.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home General Google, Yahoo, Microsoft will now auto-block sex determination ads General Google, Yahoo, Microsoft will now auto-block sex determination ads By Bindu Nair - Google, Yahoo and Microsoft have given way to the Supreme Court’s order to develop a system to block ads promoting sex determination tests. The firms have also identified 22 key words including the term ‘sex determination’ related to the ban and will promptly make them harder to search. To recall, the Supreme Court back in July this year had pulled up Yahoo, Microsoft and Google for failing to stop ads for pre-natal sex determination tests. As per Solicitor General Ranjit Kumar, the practice was in violation of the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (PCPNDT) Act which forbids citizens from finding out the gender of a foetus. The primary aim of the law is to correct the warped sex ratio in India and prevent female foeticides. Dr Sabu Mathew George, the petitioner in the case, had filed a PIL alleging that online search engines which were showcasing ads for sex determination kits were breaching Indian laws. Also Read: Aadhar-ready phones embraced by Micromax, Intex; resisted by Apple, Google After the Court put Google, Yahoo and Microsoft on blast for failing to uphold the laws, the three have now put together an auto-block system that automatically banishes ads which promote gender revealing tests. The procedure is in place for both current and future advertisements. Google has also issued a statement asserting that it has decided to disable certain terms from showing up as autocomplete predictions. It further plans to display a warning message for relevant searches to notify users of the unlawful nature of this subject. It’s decided to do so in order to ensure that technology is used correctly to curb this retrograde practice.

With staff increases and with significant amounts of time outside of their offices, The State of Georgia was looking for a more economical and cost-efficient solution to getting things done in their offender supervision programs. They made the decision to go 100 percent virtual office and 100 percent Google. "We decided to try something that had never been done in Georgia state government history: eliminate the majority of our offices entirely and allow hundreds of our 2,100 staff members to work remotely instead," said Phil Sellers, Director, Information Technology Georgia State Board of Pardons and Paroles, writing in the Google for Work Blog. "Our existing desktop computers and office applications didn’t have the features to support remote workers, so we started looking into alternatives. I was familiar with Google’s cost-cutting, collaborative and mobile-friendly features, so my team led the switch to Google Apps for Work and Google Chromebooks." He says that they have saved literally millions of dollars by not paying for expensive hardware and enterprise licensing contracts, not to mention the increased productivity of employees who can now work anywhere, anytime. "We no longer have dedicated IT services for routine storage and email support, and our small IT staff of 35 doesn’t need to roll out patches and antivirus software. If an officer closes her Chromebook or loses power, she doesn’t have to worry about trying to recover lost data. If we need to replace a device, it’s inexpensive and fast to get someone back up and running." Many government agencies and large corporations have been leery of cloud solutions because of possible security breaches, which could include crucial data exposures. Georgia's Department of Community Supervision believes the opposite is true. "Officers used to store their data on laptops, so if their device was lost or stolen, they’d lose sensitive information about parolees and probationers," said Sellers. "With Chromebooks, we store everything in the cloud and can easily wipe and replace a device if needed. Officers use a 2-step authentication to enter our systems, which adds another layer of security." The agency is often field-based away from the office, so using Chromebooks and Android phones lets their officers work wherever they are and collaborate with colleagues via Google Docs, Google Drive and Google Hangouts. "Since we’ve adopted the policy, officers are more productive, and sick leave and employee turnover have decreased," added Sellers. Google is pushing the concept of Chromebooks, Google Drive Apps and Android as one enterprise level platform for businesses to operate. They are competing with established players such as Microsoft, Salesforce and to some extent Amazon. They are working to distinguish the Google approach by tying in their Android OS and phones, Chromebook tablet, the Google Cloud Platform and their many office related apps and chat tools so that businesses have a much less expensive alternative than the competitors. Google recently touted how its platform is the most secure. "We're talking about stuff that you've seen in "Mission Impossible"-- biometrics, lasers, vehicle barriers, bollards. All of this is custom-built, also, to make the data center more secure," said Neal Mueller, Security and Networking lead for Google Cloud.

In the meantime, here’s Daniel Taylor on Nottingham Forest’s impressive youth policy: It is probably a reflection of Nottingham Forest’s difficulties in the modern era that when they renew acquaintances with Arsenal on Tuesday it will be the first time in the 21st century they have encountered the club who wear the same colours because it was Forest, 130 years ago, who donated a red strip to help set them up. The last occasion the two sides met was in January 1999 when Ron Atkinson had just been appointed as Forest’s manager and infamously began his short, undistinguished spell more like Rowan Atkinson by climbing into the wrong dugout. Forest, with the fingers of relegation closing round their necks, lost 1-0 and it was their next home game when they played in a nine-goal thriller against Manchester United that is still talked about on the banks of the Trent. Unfortunately for Forest, they scored only one of the goals. Today, the club are 13th in English football’s second tier, exactly the position where Brian Clough inherited them in 1975. It is the 12th anniversary of Clough’s death and in the 12th minute of their EFL Cup tie against Arsenal a tribute is planned for the man who led Forest – “the most unprogressive club in the country” as one of their own committee members described them – to promotion, a league title, two European Cups, four League Cups and a place in football where they could beat Barcelona in the European Super Cup yet be clapped out of Camp Nou by the Catalan supporters.

It is still quite early in the Google+ roll out, but according to a recent analysis, membership on that site has grown 350% since it launched to members of the tech community on an invite-only basis on June 28.   Today, there are reports that over 10 million people have already joined Google +.   But scan the profile images of some of the 940,000 users  listed on the website Find People on Plus and you may notice the dearth of brown and black faces among users.  And even among those who managed to get an early invite, they are like many of the later adopters who do not necessarily “get” the new platform yet and have simply set up a basic profile and have not used it since.  Much of the buzz of the site had to do with the fact that so few people were allowed on in its earliest Beta testing stages. The curious all wanted a golden ticket. The site is used most actively now by the crowd of adventurous tech aficionados who are anxious to see Google finally get the social media thing right.  Google’s previous experiments with Buzz, Orkut, and Wave all failed to take off.   Google+ is slowly creating a new category of user addicts because it is cleaner, so far Ad-Free, and is touted as not being riddled with the same privacy concerns as Facebook, neither is it saddled with applications that litter users streams with gaming updates, for example.    Many Google+ users spend their time sharing ideas and tips on how to navigate the site.  They also lament how much better it is than Facebook in that it allows them more control over with whom they share information and interact, and how much easier it is to filter out those who they want to limit access to certain updates or photos. Who is on Google+ now? It still may be too soon to be taking a critical look at users of a 3-week old site, but since it launched, several articles have examined every aspect of the site including the fact that at one point, only 10% of its users were female.  Because more and more studies reveal that Hispanics and Blacks have higher than average mobile phone ownership and are accessing broadband through their mobile devices, it is not too presumptuous to think those groups would have been early adopters of Google+.  The “digital elite” , the interconnected web of popular bloggers, technical experts and early adopters to the newest technologies,  made up the earliest invitees.  This elite group is quite monolithic and for the most part includes middle to upper middle class professional whites and Asians.   In America anyway, most socialize in racially segregated circles so when Google allowed those on the site to invite their friends, it should come as no surprise then why the second wave of users mirrored the racial make up of the first wave.  Members of the black Technoratti who work with and associate with the general population of tech experts have a  healthy representation on Google+ now as well.  Perhaps, as they began to invite their circle of friends, they helped diversify the site. But beyond these audacious early users,  many are still skeptical about adopting yet another social media platform, and especially one that is not necessarily intuitive.   Google + requires people to categorize their network of family, friends, and colleagues into neat circles and enables users to participate in simultaneous video chat and explore articles categorized by interest. Google+ is not that intuitive as the tech savvy application development community may think.  It certainly is  not as turnkey as Facebook.  With Facebook, anyone can  pretty easily figure out the lay of the land within moments of signing up.  Not so much with Google +.   In response to some user confusion, there have been over two dozen articles published by leading tech publications and sites explaining how to navigate the site.  A killer competitor to Facebook  shouldn’t be so difficult to circumnavigate. And even then, many have already invested lots of  time cultivating a home on Facebook, building photo albums and “friending” long lost classmates and relatives.  It will take a lot to get many reluctant and less active  folks to adopt Google +.  So the question remains whether it will survive the initial rounds of early users, folks who are eager for its success and will more quickly appreciate its benefits. But then again, not all people “got” Twitter initially either.  Minorities slowly gravitated to it as well and have since taken over,  some reports say.   An Edison Research annual report on Twitter  showed that Blacks represented 25% of Twitter users, roughly twice their share of the population in general.  A Pew Research Center’s Internet & American Life Project report showed slightly lower usage statistics, but still impressive, indicating usage among blacks and Hispanics proportionate to their population at 13% and 18%, respectively. Google+  shares user demographics based on region of the country, profession, and gender but not race.   When Google opens the site to all users, we may likely see more minorities migrate over but not as quickly as one would think or some would want. Social media expert Lindsay Holmes, owner of LCH Business, a branding & marketing company, says while Google+ may be a competitor to Facebook, she doesn’t think Google+ will be Twitter killer. “People who get Twitter and use it for marketing won’t abandon it that fast because they know its utility and Google+ can’t compete,” Holmes said. ” If there is anything that will slow minorities down from adopting any new technology that would be  intimidation and once they get over that initial hurdle, they will get on.” Holmes said when people are able to realize the usability of Google+, they will join more when it becomes available to more.  “We are people that need usability and understand usability,” she added. It is quite possible then that Hispanics and Blacks, as a group, may be among the last to join the site if it indeed lasts through the long haul and becomes a viable competitor to Facebook.  They may be less likely than other groups to join the bandwagon and try a new platform.  They may remain loyal users of Twitter and Facebook as Asian and Whites, and tech savvy higher income minorities join Google+. Google+, the place to go to escape the  “ghettoization” of other social media platforms In essence, if  Google+ indeed is able to court away some of Facebook’s 750 Million users and black and brown users adopt later, we may be looking at a repeat of what happened with MySpace.  According Researcher Danah Boyd, scores of more affluent and white users abandoned MySpace for Facebook partly because there was an impression that it had become too “ghetto” and used by blacks and Hispanics.     She discussed this issue back in 2007 in a controversial chapter of a forthcoming book addressing “digital” white flight, the Digital Race Anthology. In White Flight in Networked Publics?  How Race and Class Shaped American Teen Engagement with MySpace and  Facebook, the Microsoft Research and Harvard Berkman Center for Internet and Society scholar conducted ethnographic research and used anecdotal conversations with over 100 youth to conclude there was a “white flight” from MySpace because it had become too brown. Currently, Blacks and Hispanics still have a predominant presence on MySpace and are represented on that site at a disproportionate rate at 26% and 45%, respectively, when they are 12% and 16% in the population as a whole.  Some have speculated, though not gone on record saying, that Rupert Murdoch sold off MySpace, which was once valued at $12 billion for a mere $35 million because he saw no value in a tool being used primarily by minorities and poor whites.  Some critics of Murdoch say MySpace went down hill after Murdoch’s Newscorp acquired the once popular site, first used by nascent bands and performing groups to promote their albums and songs.  He failed to sufficiently invest in it to make it competitive to new sites – Facebook launched one year after MySpace- and then quickly abandoned it when its cream users stopped using it.  A more plausible explanation may be that NewsCorp simply wanted to free up some cash to acquire a majority stake in UK’s Sky Broadcasting, that MySpace was too prone to viruses, hackers and spam than Facebook or because Facebook was simply more attractive options for users.  But those who stayed, did so by choice.  As one blogger on the Project Economic Refugee pointed out, what Latinos loved about MySpace was the freedom to be creative, everything Facebook isn’t and why they did not join it when everyone else was. Facebook  is used widely by all races these days as is Twitter. But as mentioned,  recent reports indicate higher than average Twitter use among Blacks and Hispanics and data indicate this may because they are more likely using their mobile devices to access social media than whites. According to a new report by the Pew Research Center’s Internet & American LIfe Project, 44% of African Americans and Hispanics say they own a smartphone, compared to just 30% of non-Hispanic whites. Using this type of data as a guide, several bloggers and tech watchers have pondered whether Black and Hispanics use of mobile devices will enable them to leapfrog over other groups and help them bridge the digital divide. While idealistic and hopeful, that outcome would hardly be realized so long as Blacks and Hispanics are slow to navigate to new services. Are minorities positioned to be left behind? Since Google+ was rolled out, a benefit of being an early adopter is being able to access and be visible to some of the top players in the digital, programming and application world.  Those who are followed by millions on Twitter, are only being “followed” by hundreds or thousands on Google+.  When followers pose a query as a follow up to a post by a more popular user, they are more likely to get a direct answer.  There is interaction. Right now is the peak and prime time to get on, start exploring, learn from and exchange with leaders in your field you may not ordinarily have easy access to on other platforms.  Once the site is opened to millions that accessibility will dissipate most likely. Many of the current inhabitants are dreading the inevitable.  When news broke this week that Google plans to soon open up the social media tool to everyone, some Google+ users let out a collective sigh. “There goes the neighborhood,” one person commented on the stream of noted Tech writer Mike Elgan. Another added, “As soon as Google+ is open, the quality will drop.” These retorts show that Google+ perhaps , for a few, is a place to escape the not so pleasant aspects of Twitter, including users who in the past have been said to be degrading the medium by using it to create and discuss crass, misogynistic, racist and even violent trending topics.  While some users may want to be exclusionary, Google can’t afford to shun anyone if it truly plans to put a dent into Facebook’s 750 Million user database. It will have to be inclusive of broad demographics, encourage them to navigate over and make it useful and easy for them to stay and set up shop in a similar fashion as the earliest adopters. When the site is eventually opened who is to say even whether minority groups and younger users will wander over and join immediately?  It may not matter. Google+ may bolt out the starting gate, gain momentum and slowly die out just like other social media sites that have tried to rival and best Facebook.   Only time will tell.

The video calling service, Duo, has already been released and everyone’s on the edge of their seat waiting for Allo to become officially available. So of course Google is planning to give Duo an update first… After making a somewhat quiet appearance in the Play Store among suggested apps, Allo was again rumored to finally launch this Wednesday, September 21st. However Justin Uberti, one of the googlers in charge of Allo and Duo, seemingly denied that such rumor had any validity, and offered some insight on Duo instead. The hype around Allo is real, and Uberti knows this well, which is why he started off his tweet with a mention of “the release you’ve all been waiting for”; as it turns out, however, the Duo 2 he’s talking about is very much real, and “rolling out this week.” APK mirror already has the .apk file if you want to try it, with the change log only mentioning “bug fixes” for now. While the official release notes with the update’s “many important fixes” is “coming soon,” this does not entirely rule out the chance to see Allo actually surfacing before the week ends. We hope that’s the case.

NLP allows users to look for files in a more natural and informal manner, just like with “Ok Google” on mobile. Additionally, Docs is getting a new Columns feature and the ability to download converted documents in their original file format… Today’s update allows you to search for more than just file names and words in documents. With Natural Language Processing, users can search the way they naturally talk. For instance, “find my budget spreadsheet from last December” takes into account file type and date, while “show me presentations from Anissa” surfaces shared files. Specifically, Drive will convert your natural query into specific terms that you can click into. Drive is also adding autocorrect that suggests corrections to misspelled searches. You’ll see a list of “Did you mean” terms just under the search bar just like on Google Search. Both features are so far only available on the web, with NLP results improving the more you search. Users often upload files in different formats that Google automatically converts. The Revision History will now keep the original file format and make it available for users to download. This feature is also limited to the web and can be found for Docs, Sheets, and Slides. Additionally, Docs now allows you to quickly add multiple columns to text documents.   Guides Google Drive View THe Guide Google Apps Stay current with news and updates for Google Apps.

Google Trips Works Offline Google Trips works even when users' mobile devices are offline. Users can access trip information, itineraries and other data from the app, which are all stored on the phone it's running on. So, when users are away from an internet connection, they'll still be able to see where to go and what to do. For Now It's Limited to 200 Cities Google says that its Trips application will only work in 200 cities around the world, including Barcelona and Valencia, Spain; and Zurich, Switzerland. It's unclear what criteria Google used to determine which cities to include initially and when the app will feature more cities, but if it's popular, expect Google Trips to add more locations as time goes on. Pick a Place and Find Other Spots At the heart of Google Trips is a suggestion engine that suggests to users places they should see while they are visiting a particular location. Users simply choose the location of a business meeting or where they would like to visit in a city and then tap the "magic wand" button. This prompts Google Trips to list locations around that location that might be of interest. The idea is to fill out a person's day with interesting points of interest. Suggestions Come From Other Travelers' Visits Google said in its Trips announcement that it has culled data from user reviews and suggestions already submitted through its many online services, like Google Maps, to deliver suggestions to users. So, whether users select the magic wand feature or other options like "getting around" or "things to do" within the app, they're seeing suggestions based on what other Google users have said they've enjoyed. Google Analyzes Weather and Time, Too Before providing suggestions, Google Trips will analyze the weather forecast and the time a person might go to a point of interest. That data is input into an algorithm that suggests the best options based on those important factors. The idea is to offer the best experience based on the traveler's itinerary. Reservations Can Be Input Automatically From Gmail Google has included some interactivity within its Trips app. If Trips users are also Gmail users, they can direct the app to automatically scan their inboxes for important trip details, such as when a plane is leaving, where to pick up a rental car and when to check into a hotel. However, this feature is only available when the user is connected to the internet. Google Promises Quick Day Plans Ultimately, Google Trips' goal is to help users find the best day plan as quickly as possible. In a blog post, Google said that its suggestions and magic wand features are designed so users can quickly pick where they want to go, find points of interest, seek out restaurants and build an itinerary. Google Trips wants to get people traveling and not wasting time searching for places to go while they're away. And it does it all with as little user involvement as possible. It's a particularly useful feature for business travelers looking for the best places to entertain clients in an unfamiliar city. Searching for the Best Places to Eat and Drink When users get hungry, they can tap the "Food & Drink" tile inside Google Trips. The tile lists restaurants around a particular location and gives reviews based on the data it has culled from its own services. Ostensibly, the reviews come from Google-owned Zagat, as well as user reviews, although Google hasn't said for sure. Either way, users will be able to find top-rated restaurants, regardless of where they are. It Keeps Cities for Later Google Trips' design comes with a list of cities across the top that can be saved for later. So, instead of only accessing one city available at a time, users can quickly switch between cities if they're going on a multilocation tour. It's also a handy tool for reliving a vacation and referring back to the app to tell others where they went and stayed. It's a Free Download Across Platforms Google Trips is available now in both Apple's App Store and the Google Play marketplace. Both apps are available for free. The Android app requires users to run Android 4.1 or newer. On the Apple side, users will need to have an iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch running iOS 8.0 or later.

Google Trips, released on Sept. 19 for Android and iOS mobile devices, lets users plan each day of their business trip or vacation and keep their itinerary in a single spot for easy access. Google Trips, which is similar to TripIt and other travel apps, gives users tips on what to do in the top 200 cities worldwide. The app, which is available for free, also integrates important information from user travel itineraries to take some of the stress out of determining which flight to catch and where to pick up a rental car, as well as finding out hotel check-in or check-out times. Along the way, Google Trips offers travel suggestions based on where other people have gone at your destination, what they did while they were there and where they went to find the best meals. This slide show covers how Google Trips can keep your trip on track and on time without referring to information on multiple devices, websites or crumpled pieces of paper.             Don Reisinger is a freelance technology columnist.

Vanity Fair hive business technology politics vf summit hwd movies television awards reviews vanities celebrity fashion beauty royals NEWSLETTER Video VF Store Search Business Politics Technology VF Summit O.K., Google Google May Finally Reveal Details About Its Answer to Amazon’s Echo Email Facebook Twitter SIGN UP FOR NEWSLETTER O.K., Google Google May Finally Reveal Details About Its Answer to Amazon’s Echo The voice-activated device is expected to give Jeff Bezos a run for his money. by Maya KosoffSeptember 20, 2016 12:54 pm Email Facebook Twitter By Justin Sullivan for Getty Images. Getty Images In the emerging war of the digital assistants, Amazon has the Echo, and Apple has Siri. (There is also Microsoft’s Cortana, for those keeping score.) Now, in a few weeks, Google is expected to challenge both with new information about Google Home, the voice-activated device it announced earlier this year. On October 4, Google is holding a press event in San Francisco, where the company will likely divulge details about its coming hardware endeavors. A video posted to Google’s Web site hints that the company’s announcement will involve phones, and Android Police reports that the event will be used to show off Google’s new line of “Pixel” smartphones, which, if the “madeby.google.com” URL of Google’s Web site for the event is any indication, means the phones are entirely made by Google—not with partners like Huawei or LG. Other new products are also likely to be announced, including a new Chromecast and its Daydream virtual-reality device. But Google’s digital assistant is the device generating the most buzz. Google Home, which made its public debut earlier this year, is a small, cylindrical speaker that rivals the Amazon Echo—a smart-home product that has been a surprise smash hit. Previously, Google users could use Android phones to “speak” to a virtual assistant by saying “O.K., Google,” but there hadn’t been a comparable smart-home product until Google announced Google Home earlier this year. Google technically already had a smart-home appliance in Nest, which it bought a few years ago, but Nest didn’t have the voice-activation capabilities of Google Home. Nest had wanted to take part in Google’s voice-automated technology project, the Information reported in March, but had been “rebuffed,” possibly underscoring alleged tensions between the two teams. Nest had also considered simply making its own version of Echo, but ultimately decided not to, amid fears that its customers wouldn’t trust such a device made by a search giant like Google. “At the end of the day, it’s Google,” one source told Re/code at the time. “There are trust issues.” Those fears seem to have been mitigated to some degree by the excited response to the Google Home announcement, though time will tell if Google can make a viable competitor to the Echo, which, as of April, had sales of 3 million units and counting.

Comcast, AT&T Try Again To Stall Google Fiber In Nashville By Writing Law To Slow It Down Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Comcast, AT&T Try Again To Stall Google Fiber In Nashville By Writing Law To Slow It Down Image courtesy of Adam Fagen September 20, 2016 12:43 pm EST By Kate Cox@kcoxdc everything but the kitchen sink nashville google google fiber at&t comcast local politics broadband competition There’s been a fight a-brewing in local politics in Nashville for weeks. At its most basic, it’s some disagreement about utility regulation. But it’s also, an another level, every fight about broadband competition — and the lack thereof — going on in the U.S. right now, distilled down into one city. Our players? Google, Comcast, AT&T, and the Nashville metro council. The council voted recently to move forward with a piece of legislation that would make it easier for Google Fiber to come to town. Where you see proposals, though, you see counter-proposals. And as Ars Technica reports, the latest counter-proposal is brought to you by none other than AT&T and Comcast, the incumbents that are trying to fight Google’s entry in the first place. To return briefly to the department of back-story: The regulation being proposed by the city council would basically change the rules about who has to do what on utility poles, and instead of every adjustment requiring a million phone calls to a zillion companies, would let whoever is working on the pole simply make adjustments as necessary themselves. From that deeply uninteresting-sounding piece of regulation, though, are big new things born: in reality, it would let Google just come in and get the cables for Google Fiber strung up around town quickly, without having to face interference from the incumbents — that’d be AT&T and Comcast — over every. single. wire. on. every. single. pole. AT&T and Comcast, of course, have a vested interest in not making it easy for a well-liked competitor with fast, reliable, price-competitive service to come to town without a fight. The saga’s been going on for weeks. We learned back in early August about the Nashville council’s tentative plans to enact the one-touch proposal, and Comcast and AT&T’s strong objections — even though neither company had yet seen the full proposal. The city’s mayor seemingly got tired of all the saber-rattling and, in mid-August, basically asked everyone to sit down and hash out a compromise like grown-ups. That meeting did indeed take place, but did not exactly advance talks or engender compromise. And a majority of the city council basically decided not to care what AT&T and Comcast think about more competition coming to town, and in early September voted 32-7 to move ahead anyway. A margin of 32-7, while an overwhelming majority, is not unanimity, though — and a counter-proposal from one of those dissenters is where we find ourselves today. One of the dissenters, Sheri Weiner, asked AT&T and Comcast to come up with a competing proposal before the final vote to adopt any new rule. And so they did. Weiner told Ars that she would “file a resolution if they had something that made sense and wasn’t as drastic” as the Google-Fiber friendly rule she earlier dissented from. She also told Ars that she intends to edit the version that the businesses submitted, before the vote takes place, but that she “had them [AT&T and Comcast] submit it for me as I was out of town all last week on business.” AT&T denied to Ars Technica that it literally drafted the resolution that Weiner is putting forth, though did say that they, “Welcome the work that is being done to craft a better solution.” Comcast didn’t comment at all. The incumbent-friendly counter-proposal, meanwhile, isn’t actually a law so much as it is a suggestion. After receiving Weiner’s suggested edits, it would cut from 45 days to 30 days the amount of time the Nashville Electric Service has to process permit applications, and gives companies 45 days after receiving a permit to complete work. It also sets a sort of ideal target of working on an average of 125 utility poles per week, and setting fines of $500 per pole per month of delay. Those fines would be $500 per pole in the first month, $1,000 per pole in the second month, and $1,500 per pole in the third month of delay — not exactly legendary sums for Comcast (current value: $159.8 billion) or AT&T (current value: $245.4 billion) to come up with. Of course, Comcast and AT&T aren’t the only ones with a hand in legislation; Google and metro councilors alike both admit that Google Fiber and others contributed to the text of the proposal being voted on tonight. However, the one-touch proposal opens up utility poles to basically any new competitor that would come to town; someone could come in and benefit down the line from the legal work Google’s done today. But a proposal that favors incumbents and blocks competition now does so down the line, too. The incumbents’ dislike for the possibility of Google coming to town is also nothing personal; AT&T and Comcast pretty much always lobby hard against, and write legislation blocking, new competitors. The metro council will hold its final vote on the one-touch ordinance resolution tonight, Sept. 20. If it passes, it must then go to the mayor’s desk for a signature, after which Nashville will almost certainly face a lawsuit from AT&T.

Google Drive gets more Google-like with debut of smarter search Posted Sep 20, 2016 by Sarah Perez (@sarahintampa) 0 SHARES Next Story Here’s MakerBot’s bid for the future The search box in Google Drive is getting an upgrade that will make it function more like Google Search, Google announced this morning. The improvements include a new autocorrect feature which will help by suggesting corrections to misspelled search terms, as well as support for natural language processing. That means you can now search for files on Drive using language that’s more like the way you speak in real life. This latter addition seems to bring to mind our increasing use of voice-powered queries when interacting with web services and apps, and could be the precursor to broader voice support in Google Drive planned for a later date. For the time being, however, it could come in handy when using voice-to-text input in lieu of typing. With natural language processing (NLP), you’ll also soon be able to search Google Drive by saying things like “find my budget spreadsheet from last December” or “show me presentations from Anissa,” explains Google, offering examples of how to use the new query method. The feature will improve over time, too, so the results will become more accurate with more frequent use, the company notes. Along with these bigger changes, Google Docs is receiving a couple of tweaks, as well, based on user feedback requests. For starters, you’ll be able to split a document into multiple columns by choosing the new “Columns” option from the “Format” menu. And Google Docs will now automatically save a copy of the non-Google file you open, convert and edit in Docs, Sheets and Slides in its original format. This will be available from “Revision History” menu. These features along with the improved search interface are rolling out starting today to all users worldwide, so if you don’t see them yet, you should fairly soon. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Google Founded 1998 Overview Google is a multinational corporation that is specialized in internet-related services and products.

It sits near the Baltic Sea, between Poland and Lithuania, and it’s a place where pre-Putin Russian leaders would occasionally threaten to install nuclear missiles. But in the 18th century, it was a city called Königsberg in the German kingdom of Prussia. And it was a math problem. Königsberg stretched across both banks of the river Pregel, and it included two islands in the middle of the river. Seven bridges connected these islands and the rest of Königsberg, and for years, people wondered if they could walk across all seven bridges without crossing any of them more than once. Then, in 1736, the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler (pronounced oiler) showed it was impossible. The trouble was that each landmass—the two islands and the two river banks—were touched by an odd number of bridges. If each was touched by an even number, a continuous walk across all the bridges would have been doable. Euler called his work Geometriam Situs, or the Geometry of Place, and it was the beginning of what we now call graph theory. After many years, with Prussia vanishing and Königsberg morphing into Kalingrad and the Soviet Union giving way to Putin’s Russia, it produced an app from Google. The Königsberg Bridge Problem. Encyclopaedia Britannica/UIG/Getty Images This week, Google unveiled a smartphone app that helps you plan your vacations. It’s called Trips, and among other things, it will automatically plan sightseeing trips through the world’s big cities. You tell it you’ll be in Paris for eight hours, and it maps out a path from one notable sight to another, giving you just enough time to enjoy one before moving to the next. It does this with two things: scads of online data showing sightseeing visits by others in the past, and Euler’s Geometry of Place. “If you know the places you want to visit, you can use algorithms built on top of Euler to figure out the best route,” says Google researcher Andrew Tomkins, who worked on the project. “Euler is a sub-routine for our itinerary work.” In recent years, Google and other Internet operations like Facebook and Amazon have changed the way we live through the analysis of massive amounts of data. Inside Google Research, Tomkins was also part of the team that built Smart Reply, a Gmail tool that has learned to automatically respond to emails by analyze millions of existing replies, and so many others are doing similar work with not only email messages, but photos and spoken words and even computer viruses and targeted ads. But it’s worth remembering that none of this is magic-–not even the deep neural networks that are built in the image of the human brain. At the bottom of it all, this is just good old fashioned math. Sometimes, it’s 280-year-old math. Under the covers, Trip does make use of neural networks, which is really just very complex linear algebra. But the more important player is graph theory. In graph theory, the Königsberg bridges are called edges and the landmasses are called nodes, and Google can apply this model to the cities where Trips maps out your daily sightseeing. The sights are the edges, and the roads between them are the nodes. Again, the basic problem is: can you visit all the edges without visiting any of them more than once? It’s a matter of even edges versus odd. But it’s also more complicated than that. Google must also consider how long you’ll need to travel from stop to stop, how much time you’ll need for each, when sights are open and when they’re closed, and so on. As Tomkins explains, it morphs into another classic math problem—the one about the traveling salesman—and this requires another algorithm that builds on Euler’s graph theory. This one, called the Christofides algorithm, is a bit younger. It was published in the great year of 1976. What Google is adding to all this is data—lots and lots of data. Thanks to location services built into Android phones, it knows how much time people spend at Big Ben and Parliament and Buckingham Palace. It knows which sites are must popular when. “There are a lot of people who have done this before,” Tomkins says. “We want to pool the collective wisdom.” Which is great. But we have one question: can Google Trips plan us a trip across the bridges of Königsberg? Tomkins says Königsberg isn’t on the list of cities covered by Trips, and that makes sense. Königsberg doesn’t exist anymore, and some of the bridges are no longer there. Which is too bad. We’d like to see Google try the impossible. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File PhotoMore BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Alphabet's Google has been given an extra three weeks to respond to EU antitrust charges that it abused its dominant Android mobile operating system to squeeze out rivals, the European Commission said on Tuesday. The U.S. tech giant had been due to file a response by Tuesday but said it needed more time and will now reply by Oct. 7, a Commission spokesman said, the third extension of the deadline. The Commission in April accused Google of harming consumers because it required mobile phone makers to pre-install Google Search and the Google Chrome browser on their smartphones to access other Google apps. "We confirm that the new deadline set by the Commission is Oct. 7," a Commission spokesman said. "Google asked for additional time to review the documents in the case file." The world's most popular Internet search engine has also asked and been granted an extension to Oct. 13 to reply to a separate charge of favoring its shopping service over rival services in Internet search results. It has until Oct. 5 to respond to a third accusation of blocking competitors in online search advertising. Google, which could be fined up to $7.4 billion or 10 percent of its global turnover for each charge and forced to change its business practices if found guilty of breaching EU rules, has previously deny any wrongdoing.

In this series of blogs, we’ll highlight some of the speakers that will be at this year’s conference. We’ll also discuss the technologies and outlooks of the speakers themselves. Make sure to read to the end to get a special Percona Live Europe registration bonus! In this Percona Live Europe featured talk, we’ll meet Marc Berhault, Engineer at Cockroach Labs.His talk will be on Inside CockroachDB’s Survivability Model. This talk takes a deep dive into CockroachDB, a database whose “survive and thrive” model aims to bring the best aspects of Google’s next generation database, Spanner, to the rest of the world via open source. I had a chance to speak with Marc and learn a bit more about these questions: Percona: Give me a brief history of yourself: how you got into database development, where you work, what you love about it. Marc: I started out as a Site Reliability Engineer managing Google’s storage infrastructure (GFS). Back in those days, keeping a cluster up and running mostly meant worrying about the masters. I then switched to a developer role on Google’s next-generation storage system, which replaced the single write master with sharded metadata handlers. This increased the reliability of the entire system considerably, allowing for machine and network failures. SRE concerns gradually shifted away from machine reliability towards more interesting problems, such as multi-tenancy issues (quotas, provisioning, isolation) and larger scale failures. After leaving Google, I found myself back in a world where one had to worry about a single machine all over again – at least when running your own infrastructure. I kept hearing the same story: a midsize company starts to grow out of its single-machine database and starts trimming the edges. This means moving tables to other hosts, shrinking schemas, etc., in order to avoid the dreaded “great sharding of the monolithic table,” often accompanied by its friends: cross-shard coordination layer and production complexity. This was when I joined Cockroach Labs, a newly created startup with the goal of bringing a large-scale, transactional, strongly consistent database to the world at large. After contributing to various aspects of the projects, I switched my focus to production: adding monitoring, working on deployment, and of course rolling out our test clusters. Percona: Your talk is called “Inside CockroachDB’s Survivability Model.” Define “survivability model”, and why it is important to database environments. Marc: The survivability model in CockroachDB is centered around data redundancy. By default, all data is replicated three times (this is configurable) and is only considered written if a quorum exists. When a new node holding one of the copies of the data becomes unavailable, a node is picked and given a snapshot of the data. This redundancy model has been widely used in distributed systems, but rarely with strongly consistent databases. CockroachDB’s approach provides strong consistency as well as transactions across the distributed data. We see this as a critical component of modern databases: allowing scalability while guaranteeing consistency. Percona: What are the workloads and database environments that are best suited for a CockroachDB deployment? Do you see an expansion of the solution to encompass other scenarios? Marc: CockroachDB is a beta product and is still in development. We expect to be out of beta by the end of 2016. Ideal workloads are those requiring strong consistency – those applications that manage critical data. However, strong consistency comes at a cost, usually directly proportional to latency between nodes and replication factor. This means that a widely distributed CockroachDB cluster (e.g., across multiple regions) will incur high write latencies, making it unsuitable for high-throughput operations, at least in the near term. Percona: What is changing in the way businesses use databases that keeps you awake at night? How do you think CockroachDB is addressing those concerns? Marc: In recent years, more and more businesses have been reaching the limits of what their single-machine databases can handle. This has forced many to implement their own transactional layers on top of disjoint databases, at the cost of longer development time and correctness. CockroachDB attempts to find a solution to this problem by allowing a strongly consistent, transactional database to scale arbitrarily. Percona: What are looking forward to the most at Percona Live Europe this year? Marc: This will be my first time at a Percona Live conference, so I’m looking forward to hearing from other developers and learning what challenges other architects and DBAs are facing in their own work.

"Two factor authentication used to be considered only viable for high security use cases, due to cost and complexity. However, the growth in organized cybercrime has seen the technology spread to even consumer areas such as Facebook and Twitter," explains Prakash Mana, head of product for Pulse Secure. "Google Authenticator is an open standards based approach that utilizes employee smartphones to simply and easily deliver strong authentication." Google Authenticator is an application that implements two-step verification services using the Time-based One-time Password Algorithm (TOTP) and HMAC-based One-time Password Algorithm (HOTP). The app is available for Android, iOS, BlackBerry and does not require the use of a Google account or any connection to Google services. Pulse Connect Secure uses a policy based, self-service enrolment capability to allow administrators to quickly secure all applications, including SaaS applications like Office365 while dramatically reducing IT management overheads. "Building 2FA into the VPN layer with technology such as Google Authenticator is an interesting approach to extending security while reducing the cost and complexity burden for IT administrators." said Rik Turner, Senior Analyst, IT Infrastructure Solutions, Ovum. "With the popularity of smartphones and pervasiveness of internet connectivity, more organizations will undoubtedly look to deploy similar types of solutions to enhance security. Such an approach can help overcome the issues posed by insecure passwords, which are susceptible to brute force attacks, or can simply be stolen by a skilled hacker." The new Pulse Connect Secure v8.2R5 update is free to existing customers with an active support contract as part of Pulse Secure's Protection Services.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google Photos makes it easier to share, make concept videos By Ida Torres - September 20, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter If there’s one thing that people will not agree on (well, aside from politics of course), it’s how and where to share your pictures from your latest trip or your last party. While of course you could always upload it on social networks, some things aren’t always meant to be shared in public. You send pics through text, email, other apps, etc, but it can at times be a bit tedious. The latest update to Google Photos may make things a bit easier by letting you share photos through contacts and not through apps. Once you’ve updated to the latest version, the next time you want to share photos with your family or friends or contacts, all you have to do is choose share and then tap on the people that you want to share your photos with. If they have Google Photos as well, then they will get a notification that you’ve shared something with them. If they only have an email address, they will receive a link to your Google Photos. Same goes if they only have a mobile number with you. This way, you can focus on the photos themselves instead of trying to figure out which app to use for which person. Google Photos also wants to help you created automated videos based on what you’ve been uploading on the photo cloud app. Currently, it will create videos using the photos you’ve recently saved, but now, they’re going more into “creative concepts”. It will scour through all the photos you’ve uploaded that will fit into the concept video. For example, with the “They Grow Up So Fast” concept, it will look through all your photos and if it sees the same kid, it can stitch together a video about him/her. Google promises to add more concepts to make it easier for you to have photo movies that you would have made if you had more time. You can update your Google Photos app from the Google Play page to enjoy these new features.

By Owen Hughes September 20, 2016 17:45 BST A teaser for Google's launch event on 4 OctoberGoogle Google has something big planned for 4 October, and all signs point to the official unveiling of its latest smartphones. As well as nudging us to mark the date in our diaries, the company has set up a website where you can enter your email address and "keep updated about devices from Google and all the things that you can do with them". Google has released a new trailer on its official YouTube channel that all but confirms that new handsets will make an appearance at next month's event. Anything beyond this is uncertain, although recent reports have suggested that Google has additional gadgets up its sleeve that it's planning to roll out on stage on 4 October. While it's all conjecture for now, here's everything we expect to see. HTC is said to be manufacturing the Pixel and Pixel XLAndroid Police Pixel and Pixel XL Widespread reports indicate that Google is ditching its Nexus brand and will instead welcome its 2016 handsets into the Pixel fold. The company is advertising its October event under the slogan "Made by Google", suggesting that company's latest devices will indeed fly under its own banner. It's been reported that the Pixel and Pixel XL will be manufactured by HTC, despite leaked images showing devices more akin to recent handsets from Huawei. Still, reports that HTC is manning manufacturing have been echoed by Evan Blass, who consistently proves reliable when it comes to smartphone tip-offs. In terms of hardware, the Pixel and Pixel XL will be comparable in most areas other than size. The Pixel will be the smaller of the two devices, featuring a 5in display with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels. In comparison, the Pixel XL is anticipated to feature a 5.5in AMOLED display with a Quad HD (or '2K') resolution of 2560 x 1440. Pixel XL will no doubt also contain a larger battery, but apart from that the devices are tipped to share the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor, Adreno 530 graphics, 4GB RAM and at least 32GB of on-board storage. Each will come with a 13MP main camera and 8MP front-facing lens and will arrive running latest version of Android 7.0 Nougat, which brings support for Google's Daydream VR platform (more on that below). Leaked images also suggest the Pixel will come in at least two colour variants, black and white. Google Daydream The successor to Google's enterprising Cardboard initiative will attempt to more directly challenge the mobile VR market and cement Google's place in the burgeoning virtual reality ecosystem. We haven't heard a whole lot on Daydream since it was announced by the company back in May, but given that Android 7.0 is now out in the open and manufacturers are actively building Daydream-ready handsets, it can only be a matter of time before Google lifts the lid on its plans for mobile VR. Google's 4 October event, then, would be the perfect opportunity to showcase Daydream VR running on its latest batch of mobile hardware. The company is reported to have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on virtual reality content for the platform and is likely eager to show this off to investors as soon as possible, given its comparatively late arrival to the "premium" VR scene. While Daydream is based on the idea of letting manufacturers create their own VR hardware based on Google's specification, Google has confirmed it is working on a headset and controller of its own. Again, if Google plans on showing off Daydream at all, it will probably want to do on its own hardware. Google has partnered with a number of content creators for DaydreamGoogle Developers/ YouTube 4K Chromecast Google refreshed its Chromecast line in 2015 with a new design and speedier components, yet with Amazon having now launched its 4K-capable Fire TV, Google's streaming stick is started to look a little dated by comparison. This could change on 4 October, when the company could also announce a Chromecast capable of Ultra High Definition (UHD) output, possibly named Chromecast Ultra or Chromecast Plus. Google is thought to be planning a big update to ChromecastGoogle Google Home Google Home serves as the company's answer to Amazon Echo and is a sort of Google Now for the home. The device is activated with the "OK Google" prompt and from there, you can instruct Google's virtual assistant to look up information for you, manage your diary and stream music (the hub doubles as a wireless speaker). Google Home will be able to interact with other home automation systems like Nest, meaning you'll be able to use it to control smart lightning and heating setups. Sadly, we know little about when we'll be able to buy it, how much it'll cost or whether it'll brew us a cup of tea from the comfort of our bed. Huawei Nexus 7P Google's Nexus range may not be entirely dead, following reports that there is a Huawei-made tablet in the works. We don't know a whole lot about the slated slate, other than that it could have a 7in screen, 4GB RAM and may possibly come running Google's new Andromeda OS. Huawei made 2015's Nexus 6P and has hinted that it has renewed its licence to make devices for Google - could 4 October bring us a Nexus 7P? Hopefully, Google will have more to say on 4 October.

If found guilty of avoiding payments, the firm could have to pay up to four times the amount it originally owed. This would mean a bill of $418m for 2015 alone. “Google’s argument is that they just did tax planning,” Muhammad Hanif, head of the Indonesian tax office’s special cases branch told the news agency. “Tax planning is legal, but aggressive tax planning – to the extent that the country where the revenue is made does not get anything – is not.” The Indonesian tax office alleges that Google paid less than 0.1% of the total income and value added taxes it owed in 2015. Most of Google’s Indonesian revenue is booked at the firm’s Asia Pacific headquarters in Singapore. Indonesian authorities took the rare move to pursue a criminal case against Google after the company’s Asia Pacific headquarters declined to be audited in June. Google has said the firm will cooperate with the government, but that it has paid all applicable taxes in Indonesia. Hanif said that along with Facebook, Google accounts for around 70% of an advertising industry for online content providers worth an estimated $830m annually, although other studies have put the figure at less than half of that. The Indonesian government is also planning to go after back taxes from other companies in the industry, and planning new regulation to ensure they are subject to taxation, Hanif added. The news follows an order for Apple to pay 12bn yen ($118m) in additional tax in Japan earlier this week. The country’s tax authorities said that billions of yen transferred between Apple’s companies in Japan, Singapore and Ireland had not been correctly declared, and therefore were not subject to the correct tax. Apple should have paid tax on some 60bn yen ($589m) worth of profits transferred between 2012 and 2014. According to the Japan Times, Apple is believed to have paid back the 12bn yen in full. Apple’s Irish subsidiary had already hit the headlines recently, after being ordered to pay a record $13bn in back taxes to the country by the European Commission. In the past few years, the commission has launched an offensive against harmful tax practices by member states and multinational corporations operating in the bloc. Globally, a series of high profile, tax-related scandals, including Luxleaks, Swissleaks, and the Panama Papers, have sparked public outcry and put tackling tax avoidance at the top of the international agenda.  Emma Rumney Emma is a reporter at Public Finance International.

Home Industry Tech Google gets more time to counter EU antitrust charge on Android Google gets more time to counter EU antitrust charge on Android Alphabet's Google has been given an extra three weeks to respond to EU antitrust charges that it abused its dominant Android mobile operating system to squeeze out rivals, the European Commission said on Tuesday. By: Reuters | Brussels | Published: September 20, 2016 9:16 PM The Commission in April accused Google of harming consumers because it required mobile phone makers to pre-install Google Search and the Google Chrome browser on their smartphones to access other Google apps. (Reuters) Alphabet’s Google has been given an extra three weeks to respond to EU antitrust charges that it abused its dominant Android mobile operating system to squeeze out rivals, the European Commission said on Tuesday. The US tech giant had been due to file a response by Tuesday but said it needed more time and will now reply by October 7, a Commission spokesman said, the third extension of the deadline. The Commission in April accused Google of harming consumers because it required mobile phone makers to pre-install Google Search and the Google Chrome browser on their smartphones to access other Google apps. “We confirm that the new deadline set by the Commission is October 7,” a Commission spokesman said. “Google asked for additional time to review the documents in the case file.” The world’s most popular Internet search engine has also asked and been granted an extension to October 13 to reply to a separate charge of favouring its shipping service over rival services in Internet search results. It has until October 5 to respond to a third accusation of blocking competitors in online search advertising. Google, which could be fined up to $7.4 billion or 10 percent of its global turnover for each charge and forced to change its business practices if found guilty of breaching EU rules, has previously deny any wrongdoing.

At first, I thought this was just another app that grabbed information from Gmail and other Google services, processed them, and displayed them in its interface to the user. While it does that, it is rather refreshing that Google Trips works without that as well. The feature set is a bit limited then, but it is still providing valuable information to tourists and other travelers. Trips enables you to type in any location you are interested in to get started. It does display an option to look up information about the current location, and may also display information about trips that it pulled from Gmail. Google Trips If you don't want Google Trips to do that, tap on the menu icon, select settings, and toggle the "Trips from Gmail" option there. When you enter a new location, you get options to check it out without creating a trip. This can be useful to find out what you can do there by checking out interesting places, day plans that Google provides, information about getting around, food & drink information, and need to know information. The information is useful, at least for the couple of places that I checked out (Bangkok, Tokyo, Dresden).  While you should not expect hard to come by information, it is a good overview of what to expect. Most interesting -- probably -- is the things to do and day plans listings. Things to do lists recommended locations and sorts them into groups. This includes top spots and a for you section, but also things like temples, local favorites, art, or an "all places" listing that lists them all in a long listing. The opening hours are quite handy as well and displayed for the majority of places listed by Google Trips. Day Plans on the other hand offers one or multiple plans that suggest how to spend a day or days. This includes a number of important sights usually which are all laid out neatly on Google Maps and with information on how to get around. Options to pin additional sites, or remove sites you are not interested in, are included as well. Favorited sites or altered trips are saved, but trips only become available on the front for easy opening if you save them. While you can open any location again by searching for it, saving trips makes this a whole lot easier. Another benefit of saving a trip is that data is downloaded to the device so that it becomes available offline. This can be useful as you may look up information even if you don't have an Internet connection right away or at all in the target location. Closing Words Google Trips does not reinvent the wheel, but it makes trip planning quite a bit easier. While you can do all of that manually, for instance by pinning sites you are interested in on Google Maps, or saving information to the device, Google Trips makes all of that easier even if you cut the link to your Gmail account. I have to say that this is a Google application that I really like and can see myself using when traveling. Now You: What are your favorite travel apps?

Old school map reader Also I do what the locals do not go where the tourists are. Just my style of life I guess not a sheep. Thailand is my home & on the computer it's so difficult because so many programs keep changing to Thai even though I state I am in NZ, have language, location etc all set to English.Facebook is the worst but that's in the wife's name as I do not have an account. When a program tells you where to go where to eat etc chances are it will cost you much more. In Thailand internet hotel bookings always cost about 40% more not counting the added 10% + if you use a credit card. Always check hotel in person before you pay !!!! That goes for all third world countries. Reply Marco September 21, 2016 at 5:08 pm # I love this app. When it didn't registered my rental car I just "tagged" the email as "Trip" in Google Inbox and soon after it showed up in trips. Trips is kinda the Trips in Google Inbox but on the phone and available offline (@Moderator: Can you please remove my last name? - Thanks) Reply Aldo October 5, 2016 at 11:00 am # I've been trying to use the app on a real trip, there's where you find out the app is actually not as useful as it looks. Everything works automatically so you don't have full control of it, you can't manually add a reservation to your trip, you can't add your own stops to a daily plan (or remove a stop that was added automatically), etc. So, for now, the app will be removed from my phone. Reply Martin Brinkmann October 5, 2016 at 11:19 am # I agree with your observations. You can edit day plans, but it seems that they are limited to a certain number of stops no matter what you do. I would not use the app for that because of that. What I like about the app is that it lists places to visit which other services do as well but it is easy enough to go through the listing and check out what is of interest to you. Also, that the data is available locally is another plus. I would never use automation to have the app scan Gmail to find out about reservations and such, so that is not really an issue for me. I agree though that adding info and attachments manually would be really useful. Reply Xavier October 5, 2016 at 12:56 pm # I tried using it for my upcoming trip and the functions are limited, exactly like what you said Aldo. There isn't much interactions with the App as it basically just pull information from your Gmail and provide suggestions based on their recommendations. I tried searching for a place I wanted to visit on Day Plans but it did not show up. Similarly when I try to zoom in on the maps to find the attractions/restaurants, as long as it is not within their database, I will not be able to save it into my plans. Furthermore, I'm not sure how the function work in pulling reservations from Gmail but my experience was that it did not manage to pick up my Airbnb reservations and there wasn't any way I could add it manually by myself on Google Trips. I have to ask, how does this help me to reach my accommodation when I do not have data, as shown in the video. Leave a Reply Click here to cancel reply.

New Google Trips app will settle all your travel headaches in just one Android app. By Michael Moore PUBLISHED: 16:39, Tue, Sep 20, 2016 | UPDATED: 16:39, Tue, Sep 20, 2016 GETTYNever be lost in a new city again with Google Trips Google is looking to spell the end of holiday stress with the release of a handy new app. Offering 'a personalised tour guide in your pocket', Google Trips wants to make your smartphone a one-stop shop for all the information you need when visiting a new place. The app, which is available to download now for Android and iOS devices, brings together all your vital travel information in one place, including flight details, GPS directions, and even suggestions of local places of interest to visit. GOOGLEGoogle Trips brings together all your reservation information into one place GOOGLEThe app will show you a selection of local attractions To begin, Google Trips is able to analyse your Gmail account to bring together flight details, hire car information, hotel addresses and more into one easy tab, meaning you should never be stranded. Once you've arrived, the app is able to create detailed activity plans for 200 cities across the world, automatically assembling the most popular sights, attractions and highlights in your destination. If you're heading to a particularly famous location, Google Trips can suggest other attractions nearby, as well as suggesting the best travel routes to get there, as well as information around local restaurants or bars. Google Trips is even available offline, meaning there's no need to run up huge roaming data bills tracking down that important email when you're travelling overseas. The launch comes shortly after Google revealed several new updates for its Maps app. Earlier this year, Google Maps received an upgrade which will let it provide even more information on businesses and locations in foreign surroundings, even if you can’t speak the local language. The update, which has already launched in Japan and will soon come to other countries, translates information about local businesses and facilities around you, from doctor’s offices to supermarkets. The categories, which also include classifications such as restaurants and pharmacies, will then appear on your Google Maps view without needing to click on a business to open its listing.

Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Instagram YouTube RSS Skip to content SEO News Content Marketing Social Media Paid Search Work Life Events Advertise 10 Keyword Tools You Need to Know Tools & Analytics July 13, 2016 Tools & Analytics Eli SchwartzJuly 13, 2016 1.7KSHARES 13.9KREADS 1.7KSHARES 13.9KREADS Eli Schwartz 1.7KSHARES 13.9KREADS For the past, present, and mostly likely the distant future, as a search marketer, keywords are your currency and language. Keywords are what drives the topics of the content you create, your PPC campaigns, and even peripherally the interests you target on social media. Access to a tool with keyword ideas and indicators of relative importance of one keyword over another is an absolute necessity.  With the recent news of Google blocking access to its Keyword Planner to anyone without an active account, it is prudent to be prepared with options in the event this restriction becomes the norm. Here are 10 alternatives to Google’s Keyword Planner for finding keyword ideas and search volume predictions. Ahrefs: Alongside Ahrefs’ backlink reporting and organic traffic dashboards, they have a really powerful keyword research tool which provides keyword ideas as well as search volume for all match types. For those conducting keyword research for SEO, Ahrefs has a keyword difficulty score metric which recently in head to head testing was declared to be slightly more accurate than other tools that offer a similar feature. Ahrefs is a paid tool, but if you sign up for a free trial and then cancel, you will maintain access to a free version of their tool. SEMRush: SEMRush has a keyword tool that is driven by its huge dataset of search data from 26 different countries. SEMRush results return keyword ideas, estimated search volume, estimated cpc, keyword difficulty score, and current ranking domains for a keyword. Moz: Moz recently launched their own dedicated keyword explorer as a supplement to their SEO research suite. You can choose from nearly any location in the globe to conduct your search and  filtering options allow you to exclude your specific query term to get more ideas, or even choose only question phrases that contain your keyword. Keyword results include related query ideas alongside estimated search volume and a keyword difficulty score. Moz also shows domains currently ranking for the keyword and recent mentions of the keyword. Keywordtool.io: This tool scrapes keyword suggest ideas from Google, YouTube, Bing, and even Amazon. You can choose suggested keywords from every Google TLD, language, and location and there are similar options for the other engines it supports. For free, you will get hundreds of suggested keywords, but you need a paid plan to access search volume estimations. Scrapebox: Mostly known as a black hat SEO tool, Scrapebox has plenty of white hat uses too (see this great guide from Neil Patel) including conducting keyword research. With Scrapebox, a small handful of keywords will easily turn into hundreds and even thousands of possibilities. Scrapebox is software that needs to run on a Windows desktop environment, but the upside is that it’s a one-time purchase vs a monthly or annual subscription. Wordstream: Primarily a paid tool to help search marketers manage their pay per click campaigns, Wordstream has a free keyword tool which allows a limited number of searches. Free results only include related keywords, but Wordstream’s paid subscribers can see search volume, too. Bing: While not the obvious choice if you are conducting research for Google campaigns, Bing’s keyword tool can still provide helpful insights on related keywords. You need to have a website verified in Bing’s Webmaster Tools in order to use the tool, but it is otherwise free to use.  The keyword ideas are not as broad as those that you might get from other free keyword tools; however, one advantage in Bing’s favor is that they display both broad and exact match search volume. Keyword Discovery: This is one of the oldest keyword tools in existence and they pull search data from the widest list of search resources. While I have found, at times, their predicted search volumes vary widely from what Google shows, this is a very useful tool for discovering ideas you might never have otherwise found. Its a paid tool, but you can conduct a limited amount of free searches. KWFinder: Keyword searches can be focused in five different countries or most of the world’s most popular languages. Results include a keyword difficulty score and keyword ideas can be filtered by a number of different metrics. This is a paid tool, so you can only conduct a limited amount of searches for free. 7Search: 7search.com was one of the world’s first PPC networks; although, you may not have met someone who’s ever used it. Their keyword tool is really simple to use and its free. Results include keyword ideas as well as search volume on the 7Search network. Even if Google maintains its non-advertising requirement status quo to use Keyword Planner, it’s still helpful to use some of the tools above when conducting keyword research just to get another perspective. Global Options Additionally, if you are conducting SEO or SEM campaigns in places around the world where Google faces actual competition—such as in Asia—you might be better off using keyword tools created for that local market. Baidu: The largest search engine in China has a free keyword tool as a part of its webmaster tools as well as a Google Trends-like product that gives hot trends and related keywords. You can also use DragonMetrics for keyword research (paid tool with a free trial) which is like a an Ahrefs/SEMRush/Moz for Baidu. Naver: The dominant search engine of Korea has a keyword tool to find popular keywords on its network. (Note: Naver’s tools work best on Internet Explorer) Yahoo Japan and Yahoo Taiwan: These are the leading search engines in their respective markets and they each have their own keyword tools (both behind login walls). Their keyword data should be the same as what Google shows since they use Google’s organic results. Yandex: The leading search engine in Russia and also very popular in Russian-speaking countries. Their keyword tool has Russian as well as English data.   If you are looking for a guide on how to do keyword research, check out the linked chapter of our SEO guide.  Image Credits Featured Image: Screenshot by Elis Schwartz.

According to Google’s autocomplete feature, which predicts users’ questions using the site’s most searched terms, the rest of Europe has a pretty low opinion of the United Kingdom. Countries such as the Netherlands seem to wonder why Britons are so “ugly,” and the Portuguese seem confused over why the English are “cry babies.” via GIPHY Germany doesn’t seem to hold the Brits much higher in esteem, often asking Google: “Why are the British so stupid?” But perhaps the Italians are the most unimpressed with good ol’ Blighty, wanting to know why its inhabitants are “dirty.” According to the marketing wizards behind Search Laboratory, the Italians have a point: research has shown that the Brits don’t shower as often as other nations. via GIPHY Other neighboring nations seemed to simply find British habits perplexing. Hungarians don’t understand why milk should be added to tea, and Lithuanians are baffled as to why people drive on the left in the UK. But there were also some nations of Europe that seemed to not quite know what to do with the Brits at all. Austrians weren’t sure whether England was a country or a city, Greeks thought English was a dialect of the Hellenic language, and people in the Czech Republic have been telling Google: “Englishmen are sailors.” Brits not keen on Europeans either While people across Europe still seem to believe in old stereotypes about the British, Albion’s residents also look with distrust at many of their friends across the Channel. Britain’s most typed-in questions about Europeans on Google included “the German stare” and “the Spanish lisp.” But perhaps there is some hope after all, as the lovelorn Brits have no qualms looking for love overseas. British women in particular seem to put their hopes on Latin passion, asking Google about “Italian men in bed” and “what do French men like.” via GIPHY Where to watch Schedule Where to watch Schedule News America UK Russian politics Business Sport Op-Edge More Live Where to watch In vision In motion RT360 Shows Schedule Business projects Legal disclaimer Privacy policy Feedback About us Vacancies Contact info On-Air Talent RT NEWS APP Android iOS Windows phone Windows 8 العربية Español Русский Deutsch Français ИНОТВ RTД RUPTLY Applications RSS facebook twitter youtube google-plus instagram soundcloud coub © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2016.

Ashley PaigeSep 20, 2016 11:12AM EDT Facebook Twitter Pinterest Facebook Twitter Pinterest facebook dialog PinterestCourtesy of Google Android and Apple considering switching platforms, listen up: Google is coming out with a new phone soon — like, October 4 soon — and it will likely be epic. The phone will be the latest in the Nexus market, and the Nexus5X is arguably one of Google’s best offerings for Android users. However, the search giant is expected to abandon the Nexus name for this particular device, Gizmodo reports. Word on the street is that the phone will be called Pixel, and will be manufactured by HTC. It will be available in two sizes: 5 inches for the smaller version and 5.5 inches for the larger one, suitably dubbed Pixel XL. According to Android Police, the phone may start at a hefty $649 in the Google Store, but Google may provide financing options. Google will drop the announcement in a live broadcast on its YouTube channel on the promised day, so be sure to have internet access at 9 a.m. PST on October 4. You don't want to miss this.

Last year, it introduced the Nexus 5X (shown here). Photo: Getty Images Google might steal a page from Apple’s playbook when it launches its latest smartphones. There’s speculation that Google will make a new breed of “Pixel”-branded devices exclusive to Verizon. When the first iPhone launched in 2007, Apple struck a deal for AT&T to be the exclusive wireless carrier. A tweet by Droid-Life stoked speculation on Monday, when the Google Android-dedicated blog said a tipster told it that the new phones would be exclusive to Verizon. The same site also posted leaked pictures of the purported Pixel and Pixel XL phones on Twitter Tuesday. Pixel and Pixel XL in the flesh. #android #pixel https://t.co/5MO1t76Kxh pic.twitter.com/BYvnYnWXP3 — Droid Life (@droid_life) September 20, 2016 Google has been selling its “Nexus” line of phones mostly on its own website for the past few years. It could continue to do so for the Pixel phones while also granting Verizon exclusivity for consumers who want to purchase them via a carrier. The Pixel devices could also turn out to be pricier. The smaller Pixel phone is expected to start at $649, which means the Pixel XL will go even higher, according to several reports. Google is expected to launch its new flagship phones at an Oct. 4 event. Google already has the Pixel C tablet and Pixel Chromebook laptop, and the company is likely to carry on with the same naming convention for the smartphones.

ClickZ ClickZ Intelligence ClickZ Learn ClickZ Live header-ad-slot November 16, 2016 Search Engine Watch Home Industry SEO PPC Analytics Social Local Mobile Video Content Development Reports Toggle navigation Home Industry SEO PPC Analytics Social Local Mobile Video Content Development Reports What’s next for Adblock Plus and its Acceptable Ads Platform? Industry More News 20 Sep 16 | Tim Flagg Facebook0 Linkedin18 Google+9 Twitter 27 Adblock Plus made a major announcement last week that it would create its own RTB platform and get into the ad business. Adblock Plus’s new service is called the ‘Acceptable Ads Platform’. It is a natural evolution of the‘Acceptable Ads Initiative” – effectively working as a SSP (Supply Side Platform). It hoped this would establish itself as an important player in the advertising technology ecosystem. However just 24 hours later those plans appear to lie in tatters. Adblock Plus (ABP) has an impressive user base and product, so what’s holding it back? We’ll take a look at what happened after the announcement and its implication for publishers and advertisers. Adblock Plus and its rollercoaster week From its origin, ABP has frustrated publishers and advertisers alike. Adblockers started out as an esoteric, fringe activity but have become more mainstream, attracting 26% of all adults in the US (emarketer 2015), powered by rapid uptake in Asia, and mobile (accelerated by Apple’s release of iOS 9 last June which enabled browser plug-ins on mobile devices). On Tuesday at the DMEXCO conference ABP announced its intention to become a grown-up player in the global ad-tech industry. Today that dream appears to have been quashed by two of the tech giants that ABP have spent years trying to undermine. Since ABP has not historically had a great relationship with many publishers, it has partnered with an Israeli ad-tech company called Combotag which has an established network of publishers. Combotag sees it as beneficial for the web user to be able to have better quality ads and an enhanced web experience. The partnership with Combotag allows online publishers and bloggers to choose from a “marketplace of pre white-listed ads” to be served on their sites. The other party at the table is the advertisers, and Combotag has an existing relationship with Google and AppNexus to serve ads which are bought via their DSP (Demand Side Platform). In theory this should allow publishers to monetise ad inventory which is otherwise blocked, and allows advertisers to reach users who would normally be unreachable and ABP take their cut along the way. Within hours of the announcement Google and AppNexus terminated their relationship with Combotag and have gone on to express their disdain for the model with Google saying, “Ad blocking is a symptom of bad ads online and that’s why we believe the industry needs to align around a standard – backed by data and insights from conversations with real consumers – for what constitutes a better ads experience online.” Appnexus similarly pulled no punches: “AppNexus does not work with companies like Eyeo; we regard their business practices as fundamentally harmful to the ecosystem. Essentially, Eyeo, via its Adblock product, erects toll booths on a public road and siphons off advertising dollars that should be going directly to publishers. We hold that practice in low regard.” With 500m downloads across the globe, ABP claims a mandate to fight on behalf of users to achieve a better web experience for all. ABP is still engaged in an arms race with Facebook, who continually try to circumvent ABP and in effect block them, followed by counter-measures from ABP. ABP have tried to take the moral high ground by claiming that Facebook is ‘anti-user’. But it is hard to take the moral high ground and talk about putting users’ needs first when many of their users see this latest move as effectively undermining ABP’s own raison d’etre, “So, the program that is supposed to block ads is going to be showing ads…. It will be uninstalled” (Comments on ABP’s blog). Further attempts to commercialise their platform by selling ads can only alienate their base further, and negatively impact their ongoing user growth. Having irked Google and Facebook, who together control two thirds of the world’s ad inventory, it is unclear where ABP will go from here. On paper ABP has some valuable assets, such as: More than 500m downloads – although what proportion are active users is unclear. An internationally recognised brand name that is synonymous with the product category. A treasure trove of data of how users behave. If I were an investor in Eyeo, the German company behind ABP that was founded in 2011, I would want to see a plan that shows how to start monetising this year. It can’t be cheap to fight all the legal battles with publishers, nor constantly be developing new releases to counteract blocking moves from publishers with deeper pockets like Facebook. As a consequence ABP are attempting to reach out to both Publishers and Advertisers with more conciliatory language and opportunities to participate through Acceptable Ads.

The critical element that ABP is missing is trust In addition to making enemies of some powerful players they have exacerbated the negative perception of adblockers amongst the publisher and advertising community and now their own users. They are still seen as being subversive, or at best mercenary. They’ve got a long way to go to convince highly reputable publishers and advertisers that they are a dependable and long term partner. ABP solved a problem very successfully, now they have to decide whether to remain outside the advertising establishment as an ad-blocker continuing to solve that problem for their users or try to become an advertising technology company serving publishers and advertisers. They cannot do both with their existing brand and business model. This article is adapted from a post originally published on our sister site ClickZ: What’s is blocking AdBlocker Plus’s ambition?

(Google) Related Stories iPhone 7 debuts, minus the usual store lineups Google suspends modular smartphone project Google launches Duo video calling app Google unveils new Daydream VR system Google announced that it will be holding an event Oct. 4 in San Francisco, where it's widely expected to announce its new smartphones. A teaser video shows Google's ubiquitous search bar morphing into the familiar outline of a smartphone. The animation also shows up on a promotional "Made By Google" page. Several reports have suggested that Google is dropping the Nexus name its current phones use, and will call their next phones the Pixel and Pixel XL. Android news and rumour site Android Police earlier reported the Pixel will sport a 5-inch screen while the Pixel XL's screen will be 5.5 inches. It also reported that both phones will be built by HTC. Google's current mid-range phone the Nexus 5X is manufactured by LG, while its larger phone the Nexus 6P is manufactured by Huawei. The name change would place these new smartphones in the same family as its Pixel tablet and laptop devices. Other unveilings Google is also expected to talk about other projects like Daydream, a VR headset currently slated for a fall release. Last month reports emerged that Google had shelved Project Ara, which aimed to build modular smartphones that would allow users to upgrade separate components, from its battery to camera to processor, as needed.

Well, as it turns out — we can. Google has updated Play Books with a new feature called ‘Discover,’ which basically looks at your reading history and determines other books that you might enjoy reading. The feature is available in 75 countries for Android, iOS, and the web. Related: You’ll soon be able to queue Google Play downloads for when you have Wi-Fi access “Google Play Books is the world’s largest ebookstore and offers readers like you smart technology that caters to your lifestyle — where you can start reading a book on your tablet at night and pick up where you left off the next day from your smartphone, as well as easily browse, skim, highlight and make notes,” said Google in a blog post. The feature is launching today on Play Books for Android, and will be coming to iOS in the near future, although a specific date hasn’t been given just yet. Google also offers Weekly Highlights, which will give you some of the best stories from the week. Not only that, but Google is also launching Google Play Editorial, which is aimed at showing off original articles from a variety of different authors. These will include interviews, essays, and more. Google hasn’t really paid as much attention to Play Books as some of the other Play services, but it’s still an excellent ebook store for those interested in ebooks, and its nice to see that it’s getting a few extra features. Of course, if Discover doesn’t give you enough recommendations, you can always check out our 100 best free ebooks list.

Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Instagram YouTube RSS Skip to content SEO News Content Marketing Social Media Paid Search Work Life Events Advertise WebCEO: Easy Local SEO Strategy Implementation SEO  Sponsored Post September 20, 2016 SEO Sponsored Post Anna CroweSeptember 20, 2016 SEJ STAFF 563SHARES 1.1KREADS 563SHARES 1.1KREADS SEJ STAFFAnna Crowe 563SHARES 1.1KREADS This post was sponsored by WebCEO. Chances are, if you’re a local business, this has happened to you: You type your city and main keyword phrase into the Google search bar and think Darn it, I’m nowhere to be found. But, that’s as far as it goes. Identifying how your local competitors are winning seemed to have been nearly impossible. Until now. I just tested the WebCEO platform complete with 15 categories of SEO tools. With it, you can spy on your competitors, discover long-tail keyword opportunities, remove toxic backlinks, and so much more. It’s pretty hard to believe this crazy awesome gadget collection is so easy to use. Laura Cruz said this tool could “Essentially run your SEO team.” They even let agencies put lead generation buttons on their websites that provide site visitors from certain “local” IP addresses with free SEO audits. Now, let’s be real for a moment: It’s easy to procrastinate about conducting a comprehensive local SEO strategy when you’re running a business or prioritizing only one or two SEO tasks. But imagine this: Work is tedious. You’re tired. You want a strawberry frosted donut with sprinkles, too. And, you want to turn your computer off so you can walk the dogs. That’s when you receive an email alert from Web CEO: one of your local competitors has bumped up a spot for a local long-tail keyword you were monitoring. You feel tempted to ignore it. You think Meh, Google probably just crawled their site and this has nothing to do with me doing anything wrong and them doing something right. But WebCEO can tell you otherwise. Let’s see WebCEO in action: How to Set-Up Local SEO in Web CEO Local SEO must be a fundamental pillar of your digital marketing strategy. While it’s often viewed as a second-hand, one-time trick pony, the right local SEO strategy can have a substantial impact. Your strategy needs to be customized to your company in a made-to-fit style that reflects who your company is, what you’re doing, and what you care about. Auto submissions to directories are mostly a thing of the past. By the way, the platform can be localized into any language via the Language Wiki, where it’s already been largely translated into Spanish, French, Italian, Dutch, German, Chinese, Portugese, Arabic, Russian, Hebrew and Danish. If you or your customers use any of these languages, it takes only a few seconds to localize your interface. Today, I’m going to walk you through how to use WebCEO as a tool to optimize your site for local SEO. Keyword Research Tool: For most beginner SEOs, learning how to do keyword research can feel like a rite of passage. Most of us will, at some stage in our SEO careers, stumble across a tool that takes away most of the painstaking effort involved with this. Yes, keywords still need to be selected with care and manually reviewed, but it’s safe to say that WebCEO has become, to me, the “unicorn” of keyword tools. Ideally, if your site content revolves around good keywords, you will have the opportunity to show up in the SERPs. As a baseline, let me uncover some of the cool keyword features at WebCEO: Get Suggestions. Pretty self-explanatory, but super helpful when it comes to local SEO — this feature can help unearth some real local keyword gems you may not have discovered using Google’s Keyword Planner. Just make sure you go to Settings and specify Google search statistics for the city, county, state, or country you are targeting. Spy on Competitors. My personal favorite part of the keyword research tool is that I can easily spy on my competitors. Just plug their URL into the tool and viola! I’m greeted with a lovely display of keywords I can optimize my own site for. Keywords from Search Console. This is one less tab that needs to be opened on my browser. Web CEO connects to my Google Search Console so I can see what keywords people have actually been clicking on my site so far. Keyword Basket. Here I can determine a list of all the keywords I will be considering for site optimization. I can use tags to segment the keywords based on what topics I’m targeting. In addition to having all my keywords in one place, and being able to measure them, WebCEO connects my keywords to landing pages and reports. I can see what keywords are achieving what goals. No more assumptions. Rank Checker: I’m an SEO consultant. Many people reading this are SEO consultants. You know the clients are always asking about how they rank locally. I want my clients to start thinking about local content creation for their blog and I’ve found that guiding them with keyword terms is a successful strategy. WebCEO’s Rank Tracker will show them if they’re in the game or not with certain keyword terms and for which pages of their site. It will show which of their competitors are doing well for targeted terms and, from there, you can investigate why (such as by setting up extra projects to audit competitors or by going to the Competitor Backlink Spy tool to sort all the juicy backlinks competitors have bagged). To start using Rank Tracker, go to Settings and click the search engines tab where you can add, among 300+ other search engines, Google city-specific search engines with mobile or desktop results to track. I can also get super granular with this and track by zip code. My particular client is targeting all the neighborhoods within New York City, so it’s relevant for me with this client. The results will show organic and vertical and paid results, all of which you can filter in various ways, with competitor rankings added via another tab. You can show a column for Global Monthly Search statistics next to a column showing the same statistics for your target zip code, city, county, region or country like this: Content Submissions Tool: If you’ve just launched a new site, one of the best things you can do is submit your website to local directories and review sites to win citations. Why? High-quality, relevant local citations improve your local SEO and overall organic results. Mary Bowling at Ignitor Digital stated on Moz’s 2015 Local Search Ranking Factors “Those who gain meaningful local links and couple it with strong on-page optimization, good site structure and useful content will thrive.“ WebCEO allows me to connect to local citation sites right from the dashboard. Next, I can review my submission results to see what actually went through and what didn’t. So now, I know what submission sites my client’s website has been connected to and what I need to investigate further. And, most importantly, I can use the Journal of Events to add a note for myself that I submitted my website to these specific listings on this day. Competitor Backlink Spy: Want to go the extra mile to beat your competitors in the search engines? Well, that extra mile requires a little less work than usual with Web CEO’s competitor backlink spy. Part of making sure you’re building a high-quality backlink profile is also monitoring your competition, and measuring what type of content is providing the highest quality and quantity of backlinks for your competition. The Competitor Backlink Spy takes out that manual process for me. SEO Analysis Tool: An SEO audit might seem like a clinical way to approach local SEO, but there’s a reason that SEO consultants like me start every project with them: they work. Conducting a local SEO audit can help ensure that I’m ticking all of the right boxes for the most organic growth in the shortest time. For example, when I’m editing my top priority site pages for long-tail local specific keyword terms, I can use Web CEO to determine how well that page is performing for those keywords I’m targeting. Then, I can walk through the checklist of recommendations to make sure the page is optimized for the particular keyword topic. Of course, site auditing will expose general HTML mistakes that will surely hurt your rankings if you don’t fix them quickly (see image below). When doing a technical audit, luckily, my pet website was seen to suffer only some broken anchors but no broken links. I can still set alerts to warn me if any links break at any time. Internal Link Optimization Tool: The other part of optimizing my client’s website for local SEO is making sure my internal linking structure is optimized. A client of mine, PetYen, is a pet startup company in New York City that is promoting dog boarding and training to the locals. In this chart I saw that, in all the pages of their website, they were only linking internally to a specific page via the anchor text “Manhattan dog boarding” one time. With WebCEO’s link text analysis I was able to see that I had opportunities to use that text to link to that specific page from more than one other page. Making Every Tactic Count Local SEO management is hard work, but I hope I’ve convinced you to commit to making every single tactic in your strategy count. We’re all human, we all need a little bit of help sometimes, and we all miss things. But that doesn’t mean that with some planning and aid from platforms like WebCEO, you can’t make every local SEO tactic create value for long-term organic growth for your clients.   Image Credits Featured Image: Image by WebCEO.

Muhammad Haniv, who heads up the tax office’s special cases branch, told Reuters tax officials have been investigating Google for some time, and paid a visit to Google’s local office in Indonesia on Monday. The Indonesian tax office claims PT Google Indonesia paid less than 0.1% of the total tax it owed for 2015, though the bill could grow into the billions as the team plans to pursue the internet giant for five years of back taxes. The whole issue was escalated after Google Asia Pacific, based in Singapore declined to be audited in June. The Indonesian tax office felt forced escalate the case into a criminal one, though Google might take some comfort it might not be alone in the naughty corner for long. Haniv said tax officials are also investigating other internet players who operate in the country. While $400 million is certainly a serious chunk of change, it does pale in comparison to the €13 billion plus interest bill Apple is facing in Ireland. While the legitimacy of that saga has been called into question on the American side of the Atlantic, the European Commission’s investigation of Apple, which initially begun in 2014, has seemingly instigated a worldwide witch hunt with various tax authorities attempting to corner several Silicon Valley giants. What has Europe kicked off!?! Aside from its problems in Europe, Apple is also facing a challenge in the Japanese market where it could face charges of over $100 million. Uber could be on the worse end of a $6.3 million tax bill in Taiwan and Facebook is addressing its own hurdles in Ireland with a $5 billion back taxes bill. Although the technology industry has been grabbing the headlines over recent months, it’s not the only one facing difficulties. McDonalds has also fallen foul of the European Commission facing $500 million in back taxes itself. Apple and co. are generally being accused of aggressive tax avoidance and what some might describe as ‘creative’ accounting. Apple, for instance, created an Irish company called Apple Sales International back in 1991, which acted as the hub for all its European sales. Thanks to a reduced corporation tax deal between Ireland and Apple, the company recorded profits in the region of €22 billion in 2011 but claimed only €50 million of that was considered taxable in Ireland, which amounted to an effective corporation tax rate of 0.05%, with that rate shrinking further to 0.005% by 2014. Uber’s bill was brought about following Taiwanese regulators decision to rework the tax structure for foreign online businesses. These are two examples of technology companies being caught out, but are unlikely to be the last. The technology industry has been a favourite of both private and institutional investors over recent years due to high profits and seemingly unlimited growth potential. Should these high profits be eroded, the technology industry may lose its position as golden child of the stock market. For the moment, the tech giants will continue to bring in big rewards for its investors, though should the Indonesian government be successful in pursuing Google it could set a worrying precedent for the industry, as cash strapped governments around the world lick their lips at the prospect of bolstering dwindling back accounts with Silicon Valley-flavoured notes.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Last night Google confirmed plans for a smartphone-focused announcement on October 4, but the leaks are still rolling in. A fresh batch of photos appears to show the rumored Pixel and Pixel XL in action, offering out best look yet at the upcoming devices. Android Police recently published two pictures of the Pixel and Pixel XL side-by-side, revealing the front and back of both models. The rear panel features a shiny aluminum frame with a smaller glass rectangle covering the top third of the device. The fingerprint scanner, rear camera, flash module and a few other sensors are all located inside that glass section. The front panel is pretty standard with thick white bezels above and below the display. Two more images of the new Pixel phone also surfaced this week from what looks like a pretty reliable source: Google’s sibling company Nest In a Dutch commercial you can see a woman holding what very clearly looks like the rumored Pixel device. The front is pretty non-descript but the two-tone design in back gives it away. Google is expected to position the Pixel and Pixel XL as premium smartphones. Both devices allegedly pack a Snapdragon 821 chip, a fingerprint scanner, USB-C and 4GB of RAM. The Pixel XL may also offer a 5.5-inch Quad HD display and a 3,450mAh battery, while the smaller Pixel sports a 5-inch 1080p display and a 2,770mAh battery. We’re just a few weeks away from the official unveiling, but we wouldn’t be surprised to see more photos and details leak out before then.

News Business Business News Google could face $400m Indonesia tax bill Governments around the world have been clamping down on the tax affairs of multinational companies Zlata Rodionova Tuesday 20 September 2016 13:25 BST Click to follow The Independent Online In January Google agreed to pay £135m into the UK's coffers in back taxes for the years 2005 to 2015 Chris Jackson/Getty Images Indonesia’s tax authorities are plannig to bill Alphabet’s Google for more than $400 million (£306m) in back taxes and fines that the search giant allegedly owes from 2015. Google’s Indonesian unit is believed to have paid less than 0.1 per cent of the income and value-added taxes it owed. If found guilty, the company could face a fine of up to four times the amount, bringing the maximum tax bill to $418 million for last year alone. Further penalties could be issued if Google was found to have similarly avoided paying taxes in previous years. Read more Apple pays £89m tax penalty for underreporting income in Japan The fine is more than the £135 million in back taxes Google has agreed to pay after an “open audit” of its accounts by the UK tax authorities, in January this year. Muhammad Haniv, head of the tax office's special cases branch, told Reuters its investigators went to Google's local office in Indonesia on Monday. A Google spokesman confirmed the meeting and said that the company “has been and will continue to cooperate with the government and has paid all applicable taxes in Indonesia.”  Google boss dodges questions Most of Google’s revenue generated in Indonesia is booked through the company’s Asia Pacific headquarters in Singapore. However, Singapore’s corporate tax rate is 17 per cent compared with 25 per cent in Indonesia. The move comes at a time when Indonesia is eager to ramp up tax collection to narrow its budget deficit and fund an ambitious infrastructure program.  Read more Google tax avoidance: European president tells MPs he doesn't know how much he's paid Apple tax row: Stephen Fry agrees big companies should pay more tax Thousands due back-dated tax credit payments after HMRC contractor blunders Other governments around the world are also seeking to clamp down on what they see as egregious corporate tax avoidance. Last week, Apple has been ordered to pay about £89 million for improperly reporting income associated with its Japan iTunes unit. 5 tax avoiding companies in the UK 5 show all 5 tax avoiding companies in the UK 1/5 Facebook Facebook paid £4327 in corporation tax in 2014, after it made a pre-tax loss of £28.5 million, according to filings at Companies House. That's less tax that new average UK employee pays on their salary. 2/5 Amazon Amazon’s UK business paid just £11.9m in corporation tax last year, even though the online retail giant took £5.3bn in sales from British shoppers. 3/5 Google So well known for avoiding tax that it had the 'Google tax' on multinationals that move profits to low-tax countries named after it. Alarm bells started ringing in 2012, when Google revealed it payed only £11.6 million to the Treasury, despite taking £3.4 billion in the UK. 4/5 Uber Uber paid £22,134 in UK corporation tax last year despite making an £866,000 profit. 5/5 Starbucks In October, the European Commission ruled that Starbucks' tax deal in the EU was illegal, ordering it to pay pay between €20-30 million to the Netherlands. The news came weeks after the EU hit Apple with a record £11bn tax penalty, ruling its 25-year “sweetheart deal” with Ireland was illegal.

The app, called Google Trips, automatically pulls details about a user’s trip from their Gmail email and recommends restaurants, attractions and “local gems” based on data gleaned from other travellers, Google said on Monday in a blog post. Users can download saved itineraries and reservations so they don’t need to worry about cellular coverage when they get to their destination. Trips adds to Google’s presence in the travel market and steps up the search giant’s competition with dedicated travel and review apps such as TripAdvisor and Yelp. TripAdvisor Chief Executive Officer Steve Kaufer has said in the past that Google has the potential to be a “serious threat”. Home-sharing startup Airbnb also is working on a trip-planning app of its own. Google’s effort gives people another reason to use the company’s Gmail and Maps apps, which feed data into Trips, instead of using similar services offered by rivals like Apple. TripAdvisor fell as much as 2.4 percent to $59.85 in New York after the announcement, while shares of Google parent Alphabet were little changed. Google has dabbled in trip-planning previously. Its Inbox email app already collects users’ flight and hotel reservations and organises them by trip. Mountain View, California-based Google bought the restaurant review firm Zagat in 2011 and travel guide publisher Frommer’s a year later to add specialised content to Google Maps. The Trips app brings that all together. Instead of toggling between Gmail or Inbox, Maps and wherever you saved restaurant recommendations from your friends, Trips lets you do that all in one place. Still, users won’t be able to book activities or restaurants from within the app. These lucrative transactions remain the realm of online travel giants Expedia and Priceline Group, as well as activity-booking startups such as Seattle-based Utrip and San Francisco-based Peek.

Revision as of 05:47, 20 September 2016 This page lists all confirmed or suspected issues involving the CA "WoSign". It will be updated by Mozilla as more information becomes available. Please do not edit this page yourself; if you have proposed changes, email Gerv. The issues are in chronological order, and have been re-numbered from the original announcement to use letters with gaps in between, for possible future expansion. Contents 1 Issue D: Long-Lived SHA-1 Certs (Jan - Mar 2015) 1.1 WoSign Response 1.2 Further Comments and Conclusion 2 Issue F: Certs Identical Except For NotBefore (Mar 2015) 2.1 WoSign Response 2.2 Further Comments and Conclusions 3 Issue H: Duplicate Serial Numbers (Apr 2015) 3.1 WoSign Response 3.2 Further Comments 4 Issue J: Various BR Violations (Apr 2015) 4.1 WoSign Response 4.2 Further Comments 5 Issue L: Any Port (Jan - Apr 2015) 5.1 WoSign Response 5.2 Further Comments and Conclusions 6 Issue N: Additional Domain Errors (June 2015) 6.1 WoSign Response 6.1.1 Bug N1 6.1.2 Bug N2 6.2 Further Comments and Conclusions 7 Issue P: Use of SM2 Algorithm (Nov 2015) 7.1 WoSign Response 7.2 Further Comments 8 Issue R: Purchase of StartCom (Nov 2015) 8.1 WoSign Response 8.2 Further Comments and Conclusion 9 Issue S: Backdated SHA-1 Certs (January 2016) 9.1 WoSign Response 9.2 Further Comments and Conclusion 10 Issue T: alicdn.com Misissuance (June 2016) 10.1 WoSign Response 10.2 Further Comments and Conclusion 11 Issue V: StartEncrypt (July 2016) 11.1 WoSign Response 11.2 Further Comments 12 Cross Signing Issue D: Long-Lived SHA-1 Certs (Jan - Mar 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue -2") Between 16th January 2015 and 5th March 2015, WoSign issued 1,132 SHA-1 certificates whose validity extended beyond 1st January 2017. This is documented in their BR audit. Section 7.1.3 of the BRs says: Effective 16 January 2015, CAs SHOULD NOT issue Subscriber Certificates utilizing the SHA‐1 algorithm with an Expiry Date greater than 1 January 2017. So this requirement is a SHOULD NOT. RFC 2119 states: 4. SHOULD NOT This phrase, or the phrase "NOT RECOMMENDED" mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the particular behavior is acceptable or even useful, but the full implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed before implementing any behavior described with this label. This means that this issue does not represent a violation of the BRs. WoSign Response WoSign chose to declare this to their auditors on their WebTrust audit. The auditors state: We understand that WoSign has established procedures and implemented controls to ensure that the aforementioned SSL subscriber certificates would be revoked on or before 31 December 2016. This issue is also covered in WoSign's final incident report. Further Comments and Conclusion WoSign say that they were aware that they were doing this, and that the cause was a delay in implementing the changes from CAB Forum ballot 118. Ballot 118 was passed on 16th October 2014, but WoSign were unable to update their systems until March 5th 2015, nearly five months later. This seems like a surprisingly long delay for a relatively simple change, given how quickly WoSign have been able to update their systems in other cases. However, as noted above, this is not a BR violation. Issue F: Certs Identical Except For NotBefore (Mar 2015) WoSign issued two certificates in March 2015. These certificates are identical in all ways (including their serial numbers) except for their notBefore dates, which are 37 seconds apart. Cert 1 Cert 2 WoSign Response This issue is covered in WoSign's final incident report. They explain that there are 16 examples, and it happens when their Certificate Management System loses contact with a signing server during a transaction, and so tries the other one, but both signing servers issue a certificate. One was sent to the subscriber, and the other was stored in their records, and then logged to CT when they logged all their certs. WoSign has since updated their system to use better locking. Further Comments and Conclusions Issuing two different certs with the same serial number is a violation of the RFC, but the impact of this bug is minimal. Issue H: Duplicate Serial Numbers (Apr 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue X") Between 9th April 2015 and 14th April 2015, WoSign issued 392 certificates with duplicate serial numbers, across a handful of different serial numbers. Here is one example. This is documented in their most recent BR audit. WoSign Response The audit report says: We understand that remediation action was taken by WoSign to revoke those certificates in a timely manner. Incident investigation with root cause analysis was conducted and relevant result was documented in relevant incident report. Follow up action was also conducted to prevent the recurrence of the incident. This issue is also covered in WoSign's final incident report. They explain that there were two bugs which led to the same result - one involving a system which did not understand serial numbers with leading zeroes, and the other a race condition. Further Comments This last auditor statement ("follow up action was also conducted to prevent the recurrence of the incident") is relevant given later issues involving duplicate serial numbers. It's not clear how "a system bug with the serial number generation, generating a serial number starting with “0” in the first left position" combined with "the signing system had a bug that didn’t know how to deal with this kind of serial number" could lead to duplicate serial numbers. Further clarification has been requested on this point. This incident is unfortunate and an RFC violation, but it was detected fairly promptly (albeit not by WoSign themselves) and fixed. Issue J: Various BR Violations (Apr 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue -1") On April 3rd, 2015, WoSign was contacted by Google, who were concerned about Baseline Requirements violations in recently-issued certificates from WoSign. Instead of specifying the violations directly, Google asked WoSign to check their certificates against their CPS. The following list of problems is a combination of those found by WoSign themselves and those pointed out later by Google: Incorrect or missing policy OIDs in all or most subscriber certificates; CPS required use of obscure "Issuer Alternative Name" field which was not being used; Inclusion of information in the Subject of the certificate (an advert) which was not validated subscriber information, and which contained a domain name, violating section 7.1.4.2 of the BRs; The CPS documentation of validity periods did not match what was happening in practice; CPS required compliance only with RFC 2459 instead of the more restrictive RFC 5280. Google noted that many of these issues should have been caught by a competent auditor. WoSign's auditors at the time were Ernst and Young (Hong Kong). WoSign Response WoSign resolved this promptly at the time by a mix of changes to practice and changes to their CPS (new versions 1.2.10 and 1.2.11). This issue was included in Google's report to Mozilla in August 2016 but not listed in the original public discussion. This issue is covered in WoSign's final incident report. Further Comments WoSign acted quickly to resolve the issues, but this issue perhaps demonstrates that their CPS was not a definition of their practice, but more a document to be updated post-hoc to match changes made to their operations. Mozilla documentation related to auditor errors states that: When egregious mistakes were overlooked by the auditor, or there are a significant number of oversights, or the auditor did not notice BR compliance problems with the root or intermediate certificates, then the CA must resolve the issues and be re-audited. For the re-audit the CA can either get re-audited by a different auditor, or have the current auditor provide an immediate plan for correction and compliance, and then present a mid-term partial audit following that plan. In either case, the auditor must provide documentation about steps they are taking to avoid making the same mistakes in future audits. If the auditor fails to assure Mozilla that they have corrected the deficiencies in their auditing process, then their standing as a trusted auditor for the Mozilla root program may be jeopardized. As Mozilla was not aware of this issue at the time, we were unable to make a judgement on whether these issues rose to an appropriate level of severity to require this response. There is also the question of whether Mozilla wishes to continue to accept audits from an auditor who misses CPS violations covering such a large proportion of the certificate corpus. Issue L: Any Port (Jan - Apr 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue 0") From Jan 10th to to April 23rd 2015, WoSign's certificate issuance system for their free certificates allowed the applicant to choose any port for validation. Once validation had been completed, WoSign would issue certificates for that domain. A researcher was able to obtain a certificate for a university by opening a high-numbered port (>50,000) and getting WoSign to use that port for validation of control. This problem was reported to Google, and thence to WoSign and resolved. Mozilla only became aware of it recently. Before the recent passage of Ballot 169 in the CAB Forum, which limits the ports and paths which can be used, the Baseline Requirements said that one acceptable method of domain validation was "Having the Applicant demonstrate practical control over the FQDN by making an agreed‐upon change to information found on an online Web page identified by a uniform resource identifier containing the FQDN". This method therefore did not violate the letter of the BRs. However, Mozilla considers the basic security knowledge that ports over 1024 are unprivileged should have led all CAs not to accept validations of domain control on such ports, even when not documented in the BRs. The misissuance issue was not reported to Mozilla by WoSign as it should have been. Section 1 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Enforcement Policy says: "When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root compromise, it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and the Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs should be followed." This misissuance issue did not turn up on WoSign's subsequent BR audit. WoSign Response 2016-08-25: "We are searching our database to try to find if any mis-issued cert is issued." 2016-08-25: "For BR auditor, I think this issue is too technical that fewer auditor can find out this problem." List of crt.sh links to certificates involved - total 72. Richard Wang said: "We checked our system, the certificates issued related using higher level port website control validation is totally 72 certificates. To be clear, those certificates are validated by website control validation method that using other port except 80 and 443." 2016-09-04: Official issue report. This issue is also covered in WoSign's final incident report. Further Comments and Conclusions It is the responsibility of the CA to disclose issues to its auditors, not for the auditor to discover them. WoSign was aware of this, because some of the issues in this document were disclosed to auditors and included in their report. The completeness of WoSign's list of 72 certificates was called into question by a discussion participant who testified that his certificate was validated using port 8080 but does not appear in WoSign's list. In response, Richard said that in fact their system did not directly record the port used for validation, and so he could not guarantee that the list was complete. However, the final incident report still gives the impression that WoSign was able to generate a complete list. WoSign has since stopped doing website validation; if they had continued, better logging of the process would have been necessary. The logs they were keeping while using this process were clearly inadequate. Issue N: Additional Domain Errors (June 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue 1") In June 2015, an applicant found some problems with WoSign's free certificate service. There were actually two bugs, which we will denote N1 and N2. Bug N1 was an issue where someone proving control of <subdomain>.example.tld also was given a cert covering example.tld. Bug N2 was an issue where arbitrary domains can be added to an existing request after validation. The reporter proved that there was a problem in two ways. They accidentally discovered that there was a problem when trying to get a certificate for med.ucf.edu and mistakenly also applied for www.ucf.edu, which was approved. They then used their control of schrauger.github.com/schrauger.github.io to get a cert for github.com, github.io, and www.github.io. They also obtained another github cert using a different subdomain of github.io. These are both, in fact, instances of bug N2. WoSign discovered the github misissuances due to a post-issuance review the following day, triggered by "github" being on their list of high-value domains. Those certs were revoked. However, no further investigation was performed, and several other certificates were misissued subsequently. The bugs were fixed two months later, on August 10th, in an unrelated major update. Recently, the reporter of the issue got in touch with Google to note that the ucf.edu cert still had not been revoked almost a year later. The lack of revocation of the ucf.edu certificate strongly suggests that WoSign either did not or could not search their issuance databases for other occurrences of the same problem. Mozilla considers such a search a basic part of the response to disclosure of a vulnerability which causes misissuance, and expects CAs to keep records detailed enough to make it possible. The misissuance issue was not reported to Mozilla by WoSign as it should have been. Section 1 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Enforcement Policy says: "When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root compromise, it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and the Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs should be followed." This misissuance issue did not turn up on WoSign's subsequent BR audit. WoSign Response 2016-08-25: "For BR auditor, I think this issue is too technical that fewer auditor can find out this problem." List of crt.sh links to certificates involved - total 33. 2016-09-04: Official issue report. The report explains the two bugs, N1 and N2. WoSign classifies the misissuances as 21 N1 and 12 N2. This issue is also covered in WoSign's final incident report. Bug N1 N1 allowed an applicant to get a certificate for the base domain if they were able to prove control of any subdomain. According to WoSign, this was caused by an engineer misunderstanding the rule that if a base domain was validated, the "www" variant could be added for free. He instead applied the rule in the other direction. Bug N2 Issue N2 is described in the report as follows: This mis-issued certificate was a system vulnerability that when the subscriber finished the domain validation, they can add any domain before submitting this order to system. Looking at their list of misissued domains in the report, this really does mean "any domain". For example, a cert where the owner validated "netwi.ru" was able to add "mx.idisk.su", an entirely different domain, without validating it. This effectively bypasses domain validation for any attacker who owns a domain of their own. Further Comments and Conclusions An arbitrary unvalidated ownership domain misissuance bug is an extremely serious flaw, particularly if it's available in a normal workflow. The report seems to suggest an "issue first, ask questions later" approach whereby a cert is issued to the subscriber even if it is flagged as questionable, and the remediation mechanism is revocation rather than lack of issuance. Furthermore, their validation team works 9-5, so an applicant could have many hours to abuse a misissued certificate before it was discovered. Although it seems like the system issued a certificate which did not match what was validated, this was not investigated further. The report says: "the employee treated it as an unusual case that did not reported it as a bug." This is amazing, if true. If WoSign's employees don't think that misissuing a certificate is a big deal, something is quite badly wrong. The report seems surprised that the applicant did not follow the WoSign Terms of Use. I would not expect an actual attacker to care about the WoSign Terms of Use. The certificate involved here were all clearly misissued; even if the person could have proved control of the parent domain, they did not do so during the process. Therefore, failure to revoke these certificates immediately (as WoSign argued it didn't need to during the public discussion) constitutes a further BR violation, as per Section 4.9.1.1 of the BRs, in particular, item 4 and item 9. WoSign has since stopped doing website control validation entirely. However, that does not decrease the seriousness of the bug/feature. It also raises the question of how such a feature could make it through review, testing and QA. Issue P: Use of SM2 Algorithm (Nov 2015) In November 2015, WoSign issued two certificates that have subject public keys which are for the SM2 algorithm. SM2 is an elliptic-curve-based algorithm but it does not use the US NIST P-256, P-384, or P-521 curves. The CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements section 6.1.5 requires that only these three curves be used for elliptic curve keys in certs covered by the BRs. In addition to including subjects keys using unapproved parameters, it seems these each share their serial number with another certificate for the same subject. 1st SM2 cert in crt.sh; cert with same serial number in crt.sh 2nd SM2 cert in crt.sh; cert with same serial number in crt.sh Secondly, for the first pair of certs, the validity period is 4 years, which is 9 months longer than allowed by the BRs. WoSign Response Richard Wang: "This is another case that we will include it in our report. We issued two test cert using SM2 algorithm that used the same serial number as the RSA cert (same subject) to test if we can setup a gateway that install this two type cert, it can shake hand automatically using different cert based on the browser algorithm support." (Unable to find this message in the groups.google.com archive.) This issue is also covered in WoSign's final incident report. Further Comments There are plenty of ways of testing this scenario without using public roots - and, in fact, WoSign has updated their systems to avoid issuing test certificates from public roots in future. We note that Symantec was penalised in late 2015 for issuing non-BR-compliant test certificates in their publicly-trusted certificate hierarchies. Their problems were first revealed in September, and one big discussion of these problems happened in m.d.s.policy starting on 13th October 2015. All of these dates are prior to WoSign's test certificate misissuances. Issue R: Purchase of StartCom (Nov 2015) WoSign purchased the CA "StartCom" and did not disclose the transaction as a change of ownership, which we believe violates section 5 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Maintenance Policy. Furthermore, when this clause was brought to their attention, they denied that any changes fell under it, and they attempted to suppress further information about the ownership transfer when it was brought to the community's attention. Full details can be found in the post in mozilla.dev.security.policy. WoSign Response Richard Wang writes: "An announcement and disclosure will be made shortly pending completion of the business transaction. We can provide the proof documents to Mozilla to show this transaction is not finished if Mozilla think it is necessary." On 2016-09-19, WoSign issued a press release saying that they have "made an equity investment" in StartCom CA. Further Comments and Conclusion Mozilla has confirmed with a Hebrew-speaking lawyer that, as far as the Israeli company authorities are concerned, the transaction which completed the chain to give WoSign 100% ownership of StartCom completed on November 1st 2015. We maintain that this is the date at which the ownership change should have been disclosed to Mozilla. In addition, WoSign's press release about their "equity investment" seems to be economical with the truth; WoSign owns 100% of StartCom. The statement that "WoSign and StartCom [are] two companies operate[d] and managed independently" is hard to square with the fact that the same person is sole director of StartCom and CEO of WoSign. Also, there is technical evidence that StartCom are now using a large part of WoSign's issuance infrastructure. Issue S: Backdated SHA-1 Certs (January 2016) WoSign has issued certificates after January 1st 2016 but backdated the notBefore date to be in December 2015. This has the effect of avoiding the blocks in browsers regarding SHA-1 certs issued after January 1st 2016. The number of certs affected is probably 67, but may be a few more or less. The three certificates below have notBefore dates in Dec 2015, have signatures over SHA-1 hashes and have embedded SCTs which are dated after January 1, 2016. Domain notBefore notAfter SCT Timestamp yffsc.com Dec 19 20:37:06 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Jan 4 10:11:27 2016 GMT congfubao.com Dec 20 08:29:51 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Jan 5 05:52:47 2016 GMT my.xbniao.com Dec 20 07:48:31 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Jan 18 05:33:21 2016 GMT Because these SCTs are embedded, they must have been created before the final certificate was signed, and therefore the final certificate must have been signed in January - on or after January 18th, for the third one. These are the only certs for which cryptographic proof of backdating is available. However, other strong circumstantial evidence suggests that backdating is more prevalent. Firstly, around 12th May 2015, WoSign started using a new certificate template for some of their SHA-1 issuances. This has a fixed notAfter date of 2016-12-29T16:00:00Z (i.e. midnight on 29th/30th December, CST). This may have been a (sensible) move to prevent accidentally issuing SHA-1 certs which ran into 2017. We have found 939 SHA-1 certificates with this fixed notAfter date, including the above three. Certificates issued using this template almost exclusively have notBefore dates on working days in China, suggesting they are issued by explicit WoSign employee action. All of them have notBefores between Monday and Friday, except for 13 on a Saturday and 66 on a Sunday. Of those 66, 4 have notBefores on 2015-09-06, a Sunday which was, unusually, a working day in China. The other 62 all have notBefores on 2015-12-20, which was a Sunday, and not a working day in China. This suggests that, for these 62, the notBefore does not reflect the actual issuance date. For these 62, the notBefore date is some time between midnight and midnight on December 20th 2015, China time (+0800). (This pattern fits a system where code adjusted the date, but not the time, prior to issuance.) Here are five more examples: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Secondly, some certificates which are suspected to be backdated were issued at the same time as SHA-256 certificates for the same domain; the timestamps on the SHA-256 certificates are more likely to be the accurate ones. One example is for congfubao.com, where there is a SHA-256 cert with a notBefore of 5th January and an SCT timestamp of 5th January, 17 seconds later than the SCT timestamp in the backdated SHA-1 cert. The simplest explanation is that both certs were issued together, on January 5th. Other pairs include for ebank.pcnkbank.com (SHA-1, SHA-256) and mail.gd.gov.cn (SHA-1, SHA-256). Lastly, of the 62 suspect certs, there are three more certs with embedded SCTs where the gap between the notBefore date and the SCT date is multiple days (i.e. they were backdated, and this is cryptographically provable) but where the SCT date is nevertheless (just) before 1st January 2016, which means the backdating would not have the effect of avoiding browser blocks. Domain notBefore notAfter SCT Timestamp passport.huayingjuhe.com Dec 20 03:40:31 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Dec 31 10:24:34 2015 GMT puxbao.com Dec 20 07:49:25 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Dec 31 10:30:03 2015 GMT modai.cc Dec 20 12:02:09 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Dec 31 10:20:17 2015 GMT The issuance of backdated certificates is not forbidden by Mozilla policy, but is included in Mozilla's list of Problematic Practices. It says "Minor tweaking for technical compatibility reasons is accepted, but backdating certificates in order to avoid some deadline or code-enforced restriction is not." The Baseline Requirements, section 7.1.3, say: Effective 1 January 2016, CAs MUST NOT issue any new Subscriber certificates or Subordinate CA certificates using the SHA‐1 hash algorithm. (Thanks to Thijs Alkemade of Computest for much of the information in this section.) WoSign Response This issue is covered in WoSign's final incident report. Of the 64 certificates they consider, WoSign attribute 6 to a dual-issuance bug, 9 they say are not problematic because they were issued on December 31st 2015, 2 are the mis-issued certs relating to Issue V, and the other 47 are "normal SHA-1 orders". Further Comments and Conclusion Mozilla is seeking further information on the details in WoSign's report and will make further comment at a later date. Issue T: alicdn.com Misissuance (June 2016) A certificate has been issued in June 2016 to alicdn.com which was not requested by the owner of that domain. The domains in question currently use certificates from Symantec. Cert on Github Gist Cert on crt.sh WoSign Response This issue is covered in WoSign's final incident report. WoSign assert that they completed the domain control checks correctly. Further Comments and Conclusion The owners of alicdn.com have confirmed directly to Mozilla that this incident was caused by an attacker being able to control content on their domain. We would have some concerns with how WoSign's systems validated website control. However, they no longer support this method. This "misissuance" was possible only because alicdn.com was, for some period of time, controlled by an attacker. Therefore, no blame can be attributed to WoSign for the misissuance itself. Issue V: StartEncrypt (July 2016) (a.k.a. "Issue 2") In July 2016, it became clear that there was some problems with the StartEncrypt automatic issuance service recently deployed by the CA StartCom. This was a StartCom-branded service and was not publicised as being able to issue certificates from WoSign. However, changing a simple API parameter in the POST request on the submission page changed the intermediate/root certificate to which the resulting certificate chained up. The value "2" made a certificate signed by "StartCom Class 1 DV Server CA", "1" selected "WoSign CA Free SSL Certificate G2" and "0" selected "CA 沃通根证书", another root certificate owned by WoSign and trusted by Firefox. A security investigator used the value "1", and acquired two certificates which had notBefore dates (usage start date) of 20th December 2015, and which were signed using the SHA-1 checksum algorithm. Cert 1, Cert 2. The issuance of certificates using SHA-1 has been banned by the Baseline Requirements since January 1st, 2016. Browsers, including Firefox, are enforcing this - in Firefox's case, for publicly-trusted CAs, since Firefox 48, released on 1st August 2016. The issuance of backdated certificates is not forbidden, but is included in Mozilla's list of Problematic Practices. It says "Minor tweaking for technical compatibility reasons is accepted, but backdating certificates in order to avoid some deadline or code-enforced restriction is not." WoSign deny that their code backdated the certificates in order to avoid browser-based restrictions - they say "this date is the day we stop to use this code". If that is true, it is not clear to us how StartCom came to be able to call WoSign code that WoSign itself had abandoned. The misissuance issue was not reported to Mozilla by WoSign as it should have been. Section 1 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Enforcement Policy says: "When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root compromise, it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and the Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs should be followed." WoSign Response 2016-09-04: Official issue report. This issue is also covered in WoSign's final incident report. Further Comments This issue does not paint a picture of careful software development practices and quality assurance - having unused code around capable of issuing BR-violating certificates does not seem like responsible practice. The question of why StartCom was able to trigger certificate-issuance code which WoSign has stopped developing and maintaining is also still open. Cross Signing It is important background information to know which WoSign roots are cross-signed by other trusted or previously-trusted roots.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Google Trips, A Personalized Trip Planner, Launches Posted: Sep 20 2016, 8:06am CDT | by Noel Diem, in News | Latest Business News   Photo Credit: Getty Images   Today, Google will launch a new mobile application aimed at helping you plan your vacations and traveling. Dubbed "Google Trips," the iOS and Android app will pull data from Google Maps as well as crowdsourced contributions from  travelers in order to create personalized travel itineraries that include points of interest, restaurants, hotels, and tourist attractions. It will work with day trips or keep track of reservations for you. How To: Find Pokemon Go Plus In Stock A leak earlier in the year made it clear that Google was working with this within the Google Local Guides community. Local Guides helps with Google Maps and business data by doing things like taking photos, correcting listings, and writing reviews. In return, they are able to test out Google products first. The home screen has a search box that prompts "Where do you want to go?" and lets you keep track of current and future trips. Each place you will visit has its own tab within the "Trip" section. You can toggle everything on and off for offline access so you don't use data and drain your battery while traveling. Each city has options for things like "Saved places," "Food & Drink," "Things to Do," Day Plans," "Getting Around," and "Reservations." That isn't the only thing it can do - Google Trips will show you when a place is the busiest. This can help you find what is actually a good idea to do and show you what to avoid if you don't like the crowds. This is a feature available to the top 200 cities worldwide. It will also help you find things to do near those tourist attractions if you have to kill time or you don't want to travel around all day. If you aren't too familiar with a location, Google Trips will even automatically fill in gaps for you between activities using the "magic wand" option. Everything within the app is pretty streamlined, as it takes information from your Google email account (like reservations or flight numbers) and puts it into the app. You May Like The Author Noel Diem Noel passion is to write about geek culture.     Advertisement Leave a Comment Share this Story Follow Us Read the Latest from I4U News Amazon Prime Now Adds Bartell Drugs as First Drugstore 1 day ago, 2:28am CST Microsoft to Power its Azure Cloud Data Center with Wind Energy 1 day ago, 12:24am CST Amazon Services Expands to 20 More Cities ahead of Holidays 2 days ago, 6:58am CST Samsung Vice Chairman Summoned over President Park Aide's Scandal 3 days ago, 5:35am CST Alibaba 11.11 Singles Day 2016 Sets New Sales Record with $17.79 billion 4 days ago, 6:52am CST $79 Amazon Prime Deal to Celebrate The Grand Tour Premiere on Friday 1 hour ago Christmas Shopping May Increase Your Heart Rate by 33% 1 hour ago More than 1 Billion People are Living with High Blood Pressure Worldwide, Study Finds 1 hour ago NASA and AT&T Working on Drone Traffic Management System 1 hour ago Walmart Releases Pre-Black Friday Deals 1 hour ago Google launches new PhotoScan App to Scan and Digitize Memories 2 hours ago Lamborghini Huracan RWD Spyder Debuts at LA Auto Show 2 hours ago BMW Expands its Car Sharing Service ReachNow to Brooklyn 2 hours ago Richard Branson Unveils Baby Boom Supersonic Jet: Faster and Smaller Than Concorde 2 hours ago Top 10 Target Black Friday 2016 Deals According to Black Friday Experts 3 hours ago Amazon Black Friday 2016 Ad !!

News Features Guides Editorial Interviews Blog Tips Advertising More General Blog Conferences Contact Us 5 Of The World’s Greatest Marketing Blog Posts And What We Can Learn From Them September 20, 2016 by The Blog Herald 1 Comment I think we can all agree that online marketing bloggers – due to the very nature of the topic they specialize in – more than any other bloggers (in general) know almost exactly what blog posts need in order to rock. It’s the marketing blog posts we turn to when we need help to be better bloggers. Which is why this article presents the world’s greatest marketing blog posts, because out of all the blog posts on the Internet, they are the ones that have to be epic. They are our teachers.

Super competitive for the landing page optimization post … but Unbounce actually targeted “presidential marketing” for the other one and we hit page one, spot on within like 48 hours (beating out articles on Forbes, Entrepreneur, and Contently).

In a bid to boost the overall travel experience, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL owned search giant Google, on Monday, unveiled a new smartphone app — Google Trips. The app allows users to organize flight, hotel, car and restaurant reservations virtually anywhere across the globe. How Google Trips Works?   Google Trips — available on iOS and Android — helps a user to manage and organize a vacation in the best possible way.  The app automatically pulls details of a user’s trip from his or her Gmail account and then stores its offline. It recommends restaurants, attractions and new places for the user to visit while on vacation. The best thing about the app is that the saved itineraries and reservations can be downloaded and used later even when there is no internet connectivity. Thus, the company intends to free vacations from hassle with the Google Trips app. Increasing Competition & Continuous Innovation Competition in this lucrative market is also intensifying, with companies like TripAdvisor Inc. and Yelp Inc. doing their best to expand their customer base. In June, Yahoo rolled out Yahoo Radar, which organizes reservations and highlights sights and nearby restaurants. Home-sharing startup Airbnb Inc. is also working on a trip-planning app of its own. To counter competition, Google has a prudent plan, which includes continued innovation, including the development of new apps and addition of new features to keep customers interested in the company. Google Trips is set to benefit travelers at large. The company’s ability to innovate has translated into strong growth.   However, Google refuses to rest on its past laurels. Its continued efforts to launch products and services for multiple industries, and adapt to changing market trends are commendable. Our Take The online travel market is growing rapidly driven by increased digitization, mobile adoption and shift from offline channels. A stronger economy and higher spending levels provide the perfect backdrop for growth. With the growing popularity of smartphones and tablets among travelers around the world, travel apps have become essential. These apps offer a convenient way to receive and access information at a glance. Google’s own research has indicated that travel and shopping-related searches on mobile have increased by 30% over the past one-year period. So, it appears that with this new app, the company is set to join the smartphone revolution leveraging its core capability – search.

Version 6.5 of the app changes the name for Google Now on Tap and Now Cards. Now on Tap is called “Screen search” while Now Cards is simply called “Feed.” Google Now on Tap was one of those features that looked really cool in demos, but not many people actually use it. “Screen search” is a much more descriptive name for the feature. The name change will hopefully make more people notice the feature in settings and learn how to use it. “Feed” is also a better name for the Now Cards that show up on the Google app home page. Joining the name changes is the new “In Apps” mode that was first seen on the LG V20. The In Apps shortcut can be pinned to the home screen so users can quickly search within apps. The In Apps search is basically like using the Start Menu search in Windows. It searches inside of apps for anything that matches your search. Things like bookmarks, Drive files, contacts, books, and more.

The search giant has been producing its own Android-based phones for the last few years under the "Nexus" brand - but no more. Google has ditched the name Nexus in favour of the Pixel moniker. In the past, the company has used the Pixel name on its premium tablet and laptop products.

Read More iPhone 8: Release date, price, rumours and news about Apple's 2017 iPhone How to pre-order and best deals Pre-orders for the Pixel and Pixel XL are both open either through Google's own online store (which you can find here) or high street store Carphone Warehouse (which is here). Alternatively, you can go to the network EE, which has an exclusive right to the Pixel phone in the UK. With EE, the Pixel is free on a £50.99 a month, 24 month 4GEE plan, which comes with unlimited minutes, unlimited texts and 10GB of mobile data a month for existing customers. Read More How much does the Google Pixel and Pixel XL cost? (Photo: REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach) The Pixel XL is also available free on a £55.99 a month, 24 month plan, and comes with unlimited minutes, unlimited texts and 10GB of mobile data a month for existing customers. 4GEE Plan customers receive unlimited minutes, texts and 500MB of data a month for use abroad in the EU. Alternatively, for just £5 per month more, you can get Pixel and Pixel XL on 4GEE Max plans giving you access to the UK’s fastest 4G speeds, and inclusive access to the BT Sport App for the duration of the plan. Just as an extra sweetener, those who pre-order before October 20th will receive a £50 Google Play voucher they can use to purchase content from the Google Play store. Design The white Pixel bears a striking resemblance to the iPhone 6 although it has the rear-mounted fingerprint scanner popular with other Android handsets. Both the smaller Pixel and the larger Pixel XL will make the jump to the USB-C charging port and both will have 4GB of RAM and the same 12MP camera on the back (8MP on the front). There will be a choice of either 32GB or 128GB of internal storage, and Google is also offering Pixel owners free unlimited storage for photos and videos through its Google Photos app. And - of course - Google has kept the 3.5mm headphone jack in place, unlike Apple which ditched it with the launch of the iPhone 7. Read More What makes phone batteries explode? And what to do if YOU bought Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 Both the Pixel and the XL have a similar design to last year's well-received Nexus 6P albeit with a thinner bezel that means a near edge-to-edge display. Price Buying directly from Google or Carphone Warehouse means you can pick up the phones SIM-free and unlocked for the one-off price of £599 for the 5-inch Pixel and £719 for the 5.5-inch Pixel XL. That puts them in exactly the same kind of territory as Apple’s iPhone models. It looks like EE is the only network in the UK that will stock the phone on contract, and we'll update this as soon as we know for certain. Read More iPhone 7 vs Galaxy S7: Which smartphone is best when Apple and Samsung go toe-to-toe? Specifications The Pixel XL has 5.5-inch 2,560 x 1,440 AMOLED display with a quad-core Qualcomm processor, 4GB of RAM, USB Type-C port, and rear-facing fingerprint reade. It has a 12-megapixel rear camera and a 8-megapixel front-facing one. It will also have a beefy 3,450mAh battery and standard 32GB of storage, with the option to upgrade to a 128GB if needed. Read More Android 7.0 Nougat: All the features of Google's new mobile operating system and how to download it onto your smartphone The regular Pixel has similar specs, but it’s clearly the lower-end of the two flagships. It will sport a 5-inch Full HD AMOLED display, quad-core 2.0GHz 64-bit processor, 4GB of RAM, the same cameras as the XL and a smaller 2,770mAh battery. As expected, it will also come with a rear-mounted fingerprint reader and a USB Type-C port. Features Both Pixel phones come pre-installed with the latest version of Android (Nougat), as well as Google's AI-powered assistant Allo and the FaceTime-style app Duo. Google also "live cases" that can be customised with your favorite photos and places, as well as exclusive designs from artists like Justin Maller, and photographers like Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield. Should you buy it? If you don't like the idea of an iPhone 7 there's a lot to suggest Google's phones will offer a decent alternative. These phones will be developed to Google's spec so should have the best integration with Android on the market. What's more, they're going to be entirely free of the third-party bloatware commonly loaded onto Android phones by other manufacturers.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google planning on releasing its own VR headset, with some twists By John Hoff - September 20, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter The virtual reality (VR) tech industry has now settled such that we know that there are a few major players in the high-end, high performance VR headset market. You can look at the HTC Vive and Facebook’s Oculus Rift as the main contenders, with Samsung content to catch the midrange market with its device-powered headset, the Samsung Gear VR. But don’t look now, news from the US Patent Office say that Google is in line to release a VR headset of their own. From documents released by the US Patent Office, it looks like Google is set to make the VR industry just that bit more exciting. The headset looks to be standard looking, except for the slight twist that it looks to be connected via wire with a mobile device (Pixel smartphone, anyone?). Google might just be trying the midpoint of what the HTC Vive (wired to a powerful PC) and the Samsung Gear VR (device-powered) are doing – that is, a VR headset with its own set of displays, but controlled in some way by a mobile device. And with Android moving forward with Daydream, we can expect a lot of new executions and control mechanisms with this setup. We’ve already seen a self-powered VR headset reference device from Qualcomm, so who’s to say that Google will not be coming up with the same kind of device? Solid whispers and rumors say that the next Google event is just around the corner, possibly during the first week of October. So we’re already expecting two Pixel smartphones to be launched during that event, but there might be more. A new VR headset, perhaps?

Take a look at this promotional video Google made: The app has categories of information, including day plans, reservations, things to do, food & drink, and more and you can even download all of this information locally to your device just in case you don't get Wifi or data services where you travel: Oh, it doesn't seem to work for Google Apps users, which is not surprising.

Are You Seeing Huge Traffic Surges From Google AMP Since Thursday? Sep 20, 2016 • 8:07 am | (3) by Barry Schwartz | Filed Under Google Search Engine Optimization Prev Story Next Story I've been hearing some chatter here and there around some sites that have deployed AMP, accelerated mobile pages, are seeing huge surges in traffic from the In The News box. The thing is, I am personally seeing this as well. On Friday and yesterday, I saw massive bursts of traffic from that In The News carousel. The complicated thing is, it seems AMP is now rolling out in the core Google mobile results. So separating out the In The News box and normal Google AMP traffic is hard. In fact, there is a Reddit thread discussing the surge but that might be due to the roll out and not the In The News box. Kristine Schachinger also spotted it and asked John Mueller of Google about it on Twitter: @JohnMu so any comment on AMP page changes this weekend? @willohara @davidiwanow @methode @rustybrick @jenstar— Kristine Schachinger (@schachin) September 19, 2016 John didn't respond, so I asked the tech lead of AMP at Google who gave a typical Google comment: @rustybrick there are constantly things happening in AMP land – not always from Google’s side :)— Malte Ubl (@cramforce) September 19, 2016 So let me dig in a bit on this traffic. Here is the real time traffic for about an hour on Friday morning, the specific articles were from the news stories I posted that day and they were in the In The News carousel, as you can see, 98%+ were from mobile devices, showing this was an AMP surge: Friday was the 16th, so look at the Google Analytics chart showing the surge in AMP traffic from a couple hundred visits in a day to close to 100,000 on Friday and a lot on Monday: Again, that is filtered down by my AMP URLs: The weird thing is, the AMP report in the Google Search Console Search Analytics has no sign of that traffic at all. Here is that report showing clicks from Google to my site for the AMP filter remaining static: Here is a screen shot from yesterday's In The News carousel showing one of my articles showing up in the In The News carousel: Again, I am not sure if this is a fluke, a change in the In The News carousel algorithm or something related to AMP rolling out to core mobile search in Google (which has not been confirmed by Google). I did ask Google and Google told me there was no algorithmic change to the In The News carousel. So maybe it was a fluke for me and other publishers over the past few days or so?

Basically, now you just have to select the people with whom you want to share with, and the app will do the rest. "If your friends are on Google Photos, theyll get a notification. If you share via phone number, theyll get a link to the photos and videos via SMS. And email addresses will get an email with a link from Google Photos," the company said in a blog post. The update also features new movie concepts. For example, the app will now make videos (using the uploaded photos of course) showing the progress of your child's growth. The update is rolling out on all supported platforms, including Android, iOS, as well as the Web.

Daydream VR ready Manufacturer: Google Review Price: £599.99 What is the Google Pixel? The Google Pixel is a landmark device, signalling the first proper foray into phones by the search engine giant. And boy, has it done a good job. The Pixel is available in two sizes – the smaller one reviewed here and a larger 5.5-inch Pixel XL – and has one of the best cameras on any phone, along with a software experience that's better than any other Android device. You have to pay a premium for these features – this certainly isn’t a Nexus-priced device – but it’s far from the first phone to cost a pretty penny. And when it’s this good, it’s worth paying that bit extra. Related: Our review of Daydream View – the best mobile VR headset? Google Pixel – Design The least exciting part about the whole idea of the Google Pixel is its design. I know many people who dislike it completely, but I find it perfectly serviceable. It isn't as flashy as Samsung’s Galaxy S7, but it's much nicer than than the latest batch of iPhones. The body is made from metal and glass – pretty much a given these days – and it tapers down ever so slightly on the rear to help avoid any unnecessary camera bumps. A circular fingerprint sensor sits below the camera sensor, and both are encased in a divisive glass panel that runs about a third of the way down the back. Some in the TrustedReviews' office hate it, but I think it adds some flair, catching the light nicely. It is a fingerprint magnet and scratches very easily, however. Related: iPhone vs Pixel Google Pixel and Pixel XL video review Unlike Apple, Google includes a 3.5mm headphone jack – but I’d have preferred for it to have been placed at the bottom rather than the top of the phone. In addition, Google has used a wide bezel above and below the screen – just like the iPhone. It would have been good to see this space used for a pair of front-facing speakers – maybe this will come with the Pixel 2. The sides are heavily chamfered, and this helps the device to fit comfortably in your hand. This is one of the easiest phones to hold, helped by the fact it isn’t overly thin. It’s also completely usable in one hand, something that can’t be said for the larger Pixel XL. It’s roughly the same size as an iPhone 7, just a little taller and marginally thicker. Google Pixel – Display 5-inch displays are becoming a rarity in the Android space, but for many they provide the perfect mix of portability and size. However, the problem – aside from the dearth of choice – is that smaller phones tend to be hamstrung by weak components and a lack of features. Thankfully, this isn’t the case here. This is a 5-inch display phone with the innards of a larger device – and that’s great news. The Pixel's display is fantastic, comfortably one of the best at this size. It’s an AMOLED panel – the same tech Samsung uses on its Galaxy series – with a 1080p resolution. This isn't as high as the larger Pixel XL and its quad-HD panel, but due to its smaller size you really won’t notice the difference. It’s pin-sharp with zero jagged edges around icons when you’re looking at it from a normal distance. Get right up close, with your eye almost touching the screen, and you might notice a tiny bit of pixellation around the battery icons and on-screen buttons. Realistically, though, you won't be using the phone from such a distance. Buy Now: Google Pixel at Amazon.com from $880 Best Deals for Google Pixel Compare plans I only question Google's decision to use a 1080p panel here when it comes to VR. With the upcoming Daydream View headset using the phone display, the experience might be worse on the Pixel's lower-resolution screen as opposed to the Pixel XL. I haven’t had the opportunity to use them together yet, so will keep my thoughts open until I do. Related: What is Daydream View? Everything else about the screen is great. Since it's AMOLED, there’s a lovely kick to the colours, yet saturation looks accurate. Often these display types overblow reds and greens, but they look fine here. Blacks, too, are deep and inky – although there's a slight grey tinge to the Pixel when it's placed side-by-side with the Pixel XL or a Samsung Galaxy S7. Viewing angles are great, brightness is excellent, and the auto-brightness is easily the best I have used on Android.

The offending change was the battery status indicator that sits in each phone’s status bar, something that would be against Google’s mandate that all status bar icons be white. We felt it wasn’t such a big deal — if Samsung couldn’t change the battery icon, there were still plenty of other things they could do — but it turns out they did get permission from Google, after all. Senior VP of Android and Chrome OS Hiroshi Lockheimer confirmed that they did indeed work with Samsung to give them some leeway to stray from the script a bit. As we had suspected, this was allowed due to the “extraordinary circumstances” behind this whole event. While the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 isn’t the first device to be recalled for battery issues, it certainly is the most notable, and we haven’t seen nearly as many widespread reports for other cases as we have for the Note 7’s. The FAA even went as far as banning the thing on their flights. By and large, this is something Google could afford to be loose on, and so they gave the blessing. The result is a green status icon, though one that is surrounded by a white border so it’s still somewhat in accordance with Google’s rules. The reason Google needs those icons to be white is because they don’t want icons clashing with apps which change the status bar’s color, a design trait we’ve been enjoying ever since Android 5.0 Lollipop. A green battery would be very hard to see on the Google Play Store’s green status bar, for instance. So, the need for the rule is clear, but if Samsung can make the battery green while still making it easy to see the battery icon, then we guess there’s nothing to worry about. The only concern now is whether you’re OK with the lack of uniformity, but that’s a personal decision that you and you alone have to figure out. local_offer    Google   Samsung   Samsung Galaxy Note 7   Auto-load comments: Off On View comments (4) stars Further Reading OnePlus 3T charging proves solid Get a 64GB Samsung MicroSD for only $22 Galaxy Tab S3 coming early 2017?

The phone comes with a 5-inch 720p display, 1 GHz processor, 2 GB of RAM, and 16 GB of inbuilt storage, which is expandable via microSD. Though the specs are par for the course in the segment, Moto has given the E3 Power some essential features, the most handy of which is the beefy 3,500 mAh battery, which when combined with the lower clocked processor and HD display should provide ample battery life. To sweeten the deal, the phone is fast charge capable with the company’s Turbo charger. Android 6.0 handles the software side of things and the phone also has basic splash proofing. As an added future proofing measure, the E3 Power comes equipped with VoLTE technology, making it compatible with Reliance Jio and future VoLTE-based networks. The E3 Power is available on Flipkart at Rs. 7,999. Google acquires API.AI In a major move, Mountain View-based search giant Google has acquired API.AI, a company that specialises in conversational user interfaces. The technologies developed by API.AI have already been deployed in multiple chatbots, enabling them to interpret human conversation and understand commands. The acquisition is likely to benefit Google across multiple arenas, as the company has been working on home automation systems, software for wearables and more, besides using voice recognition for Google Search. The combination of the company's voice and intent recognition and conversation management with Google's own Knowledge Graph and resources is bound to be a shot in the arm for upcoming products like chat application Allo, which analyses conversations and generates possible responses. GoPro now has a drone Portable action camera manufacturer GoPro, whose cameras have been widely used in action and drone photography, has unveiled their own drone. The drone, which is called Karma, uses a 3-axis gimbal which also comes in handy when the device is being held in the hand. The Karma supports GoPro's Hero 4 series of cameras, as well as the newly launched Hero 5 series, of which the top end Hero 5 Black is capable of recording 4K video at 30 fps.

Rob Williams, CEO of War Child UK, said: We welcome the Prime Minister’s strong commitment to eradicate modern slavery. Children fleeing conflict are particularly vulnerable to exploitation, sexual violence and recruitment into armed gangs, the worst violations against children. However a major driver of modern slavery within Europe is the relative absence of any safe and legal routes for displaced and refugee children to be reunited with their families in European countries. As a result, children end up at the mercy of criminal networks for merely trying to get to their loved ones. If the Prime Minister is serious about protecting the most vulnerable victims of modern slavery – children, we would urge her to support the establishment of safe and legal routes for children to be reunited with their families, and invest in cross-border child protection systems that can keep children safe. And Bill Frelick, writing in Newsweek in a column titled Theresa May’s Refugee Vision is Narrow and Divisive, took issue with May’s distinction between economic migrants and refugees, writing that: May’s call for “properly applying” the Refugee Convention appears to suggest that it should be used as a tool of exclusion, particularly for people caught up in the large-scale movements of refugees and migrants that the summit was intended to address. Africa and Latin America sought to fill the gap in the convention with regional declarations that included a wider refugee definition. The European Union’s individualized asylum system has also managed to include wider grounds for protection beyond the limitations of the Refugee Convention. But advocates had hoped that the U.N. summit would close this protection gap globally. The opportunity was there for a universal declaration that there are many people in today’s world, such as famine victims fleeing drought in Somalia and Salvadoran children fleeing gang violence, who face threats to their lives if they return home, whose claims for protection are as valid as political exiles and religious dissidents.

More than £100m of the UK aid budget will be spent on returning Somalian refugees to the country they fled and encouraging Eritreans not to cross the Mediterranean under plans outlined by Theresa May in New York. The prime minister used her maiden speech at the United Nations to expand on proposals aimed at stop “mass uncontrolled population movement”, which has seen refugees travelling long distances in search of better lives. Her plans attracted criticism earlier in the summit over the suggestion that those fleeing warzones should stay and claim asylum in the first safe country they reach, rather than seeking sanctuary in European nations such as Britain. However, May pressed on with the argument on Tuesday in an address to the general assembly, as she focused on actions in North Africa to stop migrants crossing the Mediterranean. In her speech, May said Britain would send more troops to Somalia to help train local troops to combat the al-Shabaab militant group, including up to 30 teams of between five and 30 personnel with no more than 70 in the country at any one time. “The UK is now going to increase further our security support and we will be calling on others to do the same, hosting an international conference on Somalia in 2017 to maintain this vital momentum,” the prime minister said. While acknowledging Somalia is facing serious security problems, the government is also contributing £20m from the aid budget to encourage refugees who fled the country to return home from the Dadaab camp in Kenya. “We will invest £16m in Somalia to help do things around food, education, shelter and sustainable livelihoods and then £4m to Kenya to help support the process of returning these people,” a UK official said. The process has recently been criticised by the Human Rights Watch group, which said the return of the refugees from Somalia to Kenya cannot be considered voluntary as the Dadaab camp is at risk of being shut down. The UN has insisted there are no forced returns. At a later summit on refugees, hosted by US president Barack Obama, May said another £80m from the aid budget will be aimed at helping migrants, largely Eritreans, stay in Ethiopia through the financial support for the construction of new industrial parks offering 100,000 new jobs, including 30,000 for refugees. This is an expansion of the programme used in Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon to try encourage refugees settle in the region rather than make journeys to European countries. Of the 124,000 refugees who crossed the Mediterranean to Italy between Jan 2016 and 12 Sept, 12% were Eritrean - second only to Nigeria who made up 20% of the numbers crossing. At the Obama summit, May also announced that more of the UK’s aid budget would be spent on humanitarian efforts. A UK official said £1.5bn for the year would be going towards refugees and others in dire need which is an extra 10% uplift from the aid budget. About £2.5m will go to an international fund to help resettle refugees in other countries. However, May unveiled no new commitments for the UK to take in more than the 20,000 vulnerable Syrians who David Cameron agreed to accept by 2020, despite calls from charities and Labour for Britain to do more. Speaking ahead of the summit, May argued it was better to help a greater number of refugees at camps in countries bordering Syria than to resettle a smaller number in the UK.

According to US officials, other labour-related policies included those that simply allow refugees to live outside camps, or give them access to agricultural land. Refugee specialists who had criticised the vague UN-led declaration on Monday were nevertheless cautiously optimistic about Tuesday’s US-led announcements. David Miliband, head of the International Rescue Committee, a major refugee agency, said: “The political inertia has finally been broken and now it needs to be turned into genuine momentum through effective implementation of each pledge,” he added.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.03pm EDT 17:03 Patrick Kingsley A coalition of more than 30 countries unveiled a series of concrete responses to the refugee crisis on Tuesday, giving refugees a glimmer of hope in a week in which world leaders gathered at the UN summit in New York have otherwise failed to offer direct action on refugee issues, reports Patrick Kingsley from the UN leaders’ summit on refugees. Barack Obama announced that the US-led coalition had collectively agreed to roughly double resettlement places for refugees, increase humanitarian aid for refugees by $4.5 billion, provide education to one million more refugee children, and potentially improve access to legal work for another million adults. Full details were not disclosed, but the move constituted the most concrete set of refugee measures at the annual UN summit. On Monday, refugee advocates were left disappointed by the announcement of a non-binding declaration that upheld world leaders’ pre-existing responsibilities for refugees, but offered little in terms of direct commitments. But the mood changed on Tuesday, with 18 developed countries announcing plans to increase legal access to refugees, 17 developing countries pledging to increase refugees’ access to education, and 15 claiming that they would take various measures that could help to expand refugees’ access to work. The western countries included those that are well-known for their generosity to refugees, including Germany and Sweden, as well as those, such as Australia, who are often criticised for their treatment of asylum seekers. Argentina and Portugal were among the countries who pledged to start resettlement programmes for the first time. Commenting on the relative success of his initiative, Obama said: “We’re going to have to be honest: it’s still not enough – not sufficient for a crisis of this magnitude.” But he added: “I hope this is a beginning.” Leaders from the world’s major refugee-hosting nations hailed the pledges, but warned that they meant little if they were not carried out. Most pledges made at a similar summit in London in February have not been fulfilled. “The refugee crisis requires not just [pledged] commitment but follow-through,” said King Abdullah of Jordan, a country that hosts more Syrian refugees than all the countries in the EU, which has a population that is 50 times bigger.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.28pm EDT 16:28 The UN Leaders’ Summit on refugees is about to begin. The Guardian’s Patrick Kingsley is on the scene and will bring you more detail from the event as it unfolds, but politicians have squandered a chance to radically rethink the treaties and organisations that govern the world’s handling of refugees, the director of Oxford University’s Refugee Studies Centre told Kingsley earlier. Interviewed here in New York, Alexander Betts said that the refugee system needs to be rethought in the same way that the international monetary system was reworked in the 1970s. “The refugee regime was created in the 1950s for Europe and the early Cold War era,” says Betts. “Yes it’s been adapted incrementally but we’ve never had a moment of systematic reflection.” Betts adds: “In other areas like the international monetary system, when there was a big crisis as we saw in 1971, reform took place. 2016 should be the refugee system’s 1971. It should involve reflection on our legal model, our organisational model, and our operational model – and that’s what the political capital that we’ve invested in these two days should have gone towards. But as it is, I think there are achievements, but I’m not sure these achievements reach the level of ambition that the international community should have had in response to the refugee crisis.

Every single day, we need to choose hope over fear, and diversity over division. Fear has never created a single job. Our citizens, the nearly 7.5 billion people we collectively serve, are better than the cynics and pessimists think they are. People want their problems solved, not exploited. “Canada is a modest country. We know we can’t solve these problems alone. We know it will be hard work.

We need to create economic growth that is broadly shared, because a fair and successful world is a peaceful one. We need to focus on what brings us together, not on what divides us. In Canada, we see diversity as a source of strength. He says that in recent months Canadians “have opened their arms and hearts” to refugees fleeing the Syrian war, and “welcomed them as new Canadians”.

The UK remained determined to “play our part in the international effort against climate change … In a demonstration of our commitment to the agreement reached in Paris, the UK will start its domestic procedures to enable ratification of the Paris agreement and complete these before the end of the year,” she said. The UK was party to negotiations as part of the EU and will be expected to take on emissions reductions based on an EU-wide “burden-sharing” agreement, which is yet to be worked out, reports Rowena Mason. May’s decision to speed up ratification will relieve green campaigners and charities amid worries that the new prime minister could start retreating from Britain’s position as a leader on tackling climate change after leaving the EU. She has rarely spoken about the subject in the past and was accused of a regressive step when she abolished the Department for Energy and Climate Change after taking office. However, pressure on the prime minister to agree to ratify the deal intensified after China and the US made a joint declaration that they would do so earlier in the month. A UK official said the prime minister’s announcement was “absolutely a reflection of her commitment to delivering on that international agreement where the UK has been at the forefront of efforts”.

The search giant already gathers information about you through its sites like Gmail, and in return the company gives you Google Trips - a personalised travel guide and planner app that provides you all the necessary information about a particular destination to help you plan an itinerary. According to Google, planning a trip is the most stressful aspect of traveling. And Google wants to reduce that stress with the new app. "Each trip contains key categories of information, including day plans, reservations, things to do, food & drink, and more, so you have everything you need at your fingertips," Google says in a blog post. Google Trips is available for free on Android and iOS, and you can download it from Google Play or the App Store. Apart from organising your flight, hotel, car, and restaurant reservations gleaned from your Gmail account, and the app can help you plan by showing popular itineraries for more than 200 cities around the world, allowing you to pick and choose the sights and sounds you want to see to create your own plan. The app also works offline, which means you can download your entire itinerary offline so you won't have to waste costly international data when you arrive.But the app doesn't just stop there. You can also manually add specific destinations that you know you want to visit, and Google Trips will fill the gaps in your itinerary with recommendations based on the location. If you happen to visit one of the 200 cities Google Trips currently supports, your itinerary will provide tourist attractions, landmarks, and restaurants to visit before the day is over. For months now Google has been working on ways to help users plan the perfect getaway. In March, Google launched Destinations which helps users find available flight and hotel prices instantly right from Google Search. In July, Google added a feature that lets you know the estimated time that people spend at a particular location, helping users plan their visit. Google Trips is a culmination of the company's efforts to make traveling ridiculously easy to plan and execute. You can log in to Trips using your Google account and the app will show you a list of upcoming and previously completed trips. The Things To Do option in the app builds a custom itinerary based on your duration of visit.

New handsets rumored to be replacing the Nexus brand will debut. Called Pixel and Pixel XL, these HTC devices are expected to feature 5- 5.5-inch screens. Included in October event will also be a new 4K Chromecast device, which could be called either the Chromecast Plus or Chromecast Ultra. The firm is also expected to show off the Google Home smart speaker, which made its debut at I/O in May, and in-house design for a Daydream VR viewer device, which is being called ‘Daydream View’.  ‘Speaking to two independent sources, we now strongly believe that Google's formerly-maybe-Nexus-phones, Marlin and Sailfish, will be marketed as the Pixel and the Pixel XL,' wrote David Ruddock of Android Police. 'We do not have pricing information.‘ 'At this time, it is unknown to us when Google decided to shift its in-house smartphone brand from Nexus to Pixel or why (though speculation will likely run wild).’   These new HTC-built devices are said to completely different from any other Pixel hardware Google has released. Included in October event will also be a new 4K Chromecast device, which could be called either the Chromecast Plus or Chromecast Ultra. The firm is also expected to show off the Google Home smart speaker, which made its debut at I/O in May, and in-house design for a Daydream VR viewer device, which is being called ‘Daydream View’.   What they do know is that the Pixel phones should be available on or sometime after the event. Although rumours are spreading that Google could dump Nexus, it isn't turning its back on the name just yet. Included in this exciting event will also be a new 4K Chromecast device, which could be called either the Chromecast Plus or Chromecast Ultra. It is not clear the location of the even or what time it will start Google announced last week that it is introducing a feature called Wi-Fi Assistant to people with Nexus phones, which lets the device automatically connect to free Wi-Fi hotspots. The post stated that the feature 'allows you to automatically and securely connect to more than a million, free open Wi-Fi hotspots.' Before now, the Wi-Fi Assistant was exclusive to people using Google's Project Fi phone service. WHAT IS GOOGLE HOME?  Google Home is a small speaker that will be able to play music and access Google Assistant, a new AI system the search giant unveiled at I/O in May. It will harness the power of Google's search engine along with the AI technology the firm developed to beat a grandmaster at the ancient board game Go to create assistants people can talk and text with as if they were a human being.Downl The firm is also expected to show off the Google Home smart speaker (pictured), which made its debut at I/O in May- a speakert hat will be able to play music and access Google Assistant The gadget is also a high quality speaker, Google claims, allowing users to play back music from online services of a phone. It can also control other speakers, forming a voice controlled multi room hifi system, and control other devices such as lights and Google's Nest thermostat. The voice controlled assistant will be able to control devices and answer queries.  However, the company has now expanded the update to all Nexus users in the United States, Canada, Mexico, UK and Nordic countries. To activate the service, Nexus owners can go to the Android Settings app, and toggle the feature on and off in the 'Networking' section. The Wi-Fi Assistant uses a virtual private network (VPN) to try to secure a connection. This allows the phone to decide whether a hotspot is safe, without the need for users to check manually. It is unclear when the Wi-Fi Assistant will become available, however Google has said it will be in the 'next few weeks'.  Read more: Exclusive: Google's new phones will be called the Pixel and Pixel XL Share or comment on this article e-mail 36 shares Most watched News videos Man discovers wife is cheating on him following her with drone Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Victoria Fritz hides her baby bump moments before giving birth Ivanka Trump gives glimpse of her father's $100m penthouse Is this the creepy moment the corpse of a girl OPENS her eyes? 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob Shocking moment Kumbuka tries to smash glass at London Zoo President-elect Trump and family dine out at famous 21 Club Protestor at an anti-Trump rally at Ohio State gets slammed Cops shoot man holding 2-year-old girl hostage Chili's manager snatches veteran's free meal after complaint Little girl leaps to her sister's defense during scolding EXCLUSIVE: Blow up!

However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant. It's the king of the Android handsets - but still not great. Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats. The $1,000 wireless speaker that really IS worth the price: Naim Mu-so Qb review Naim's incredible Mu-So Qb takes you back to the good old days - where the music captivates and enthralls, rather that simply being something in the background.

A familiar old friend that could be the perfect starter phone: Dailymail.com's verdict on the iPhone SE The new iPhone SE has a 4inch screen and familiar design - but has had a huge upgrade on the inside, making this a perfect first time iPhone. Speaker that looks as good as its sounds: B&W Zeppelin Wireless review It's not cheap, but the $699 (£500) Zeppelin Wireless is perfect for the design conscious music fan. The iPad grows up: Apple's iPad Pro The iPad Pro is, for many, a real laptop replacement - and a way to combine work and play in a gadget that will last all day and won't break your back to carry.

We’re expecting 2 HTC-made phones (Pixel and Pixel XL), and if we’re lucky we may even get news on that new 7-inch tablet Huawei has in the works. It seems some arms of Google’s new-age machine couldn’t quite contain their excitement, though. The company has only been willing to give us silhouettes to date, but Nest thought it wise to show an actual unit in use in one of their ads (seen above, still below). Of course, it’s no harm at this point considering we’re getting clearer and clearer looks at the smartphone each and every day with little mystery left in terms of its design and features. Still, we imagine someone’s going to get a stern talking to over there. As for a more tease-like teaser, you can see Google’s first one straight ahead.

From previous descriptions and rumours – and the fact that the devices are seen displaying the newest Android boot-up screens, what we’re seeing here (courtesy of Android Police) could indeed be Google’s Nexus successors – the Pixel and the Pixel XL. First believed to be based on the HTC Marlin and Starfish an unreleased duo of handsets, the pair pictured carries some of the similar appearances and features of those prototype models – as well as some details carried forward from the soon to be discontinued Nexus brand. This including circle fingerprint sensor in the centre back and the banding across the bottom back casing. Although the Marlin and Starfish seen before did not feature the camera in the top corner and were in black, these are in a very light aluminium finish (two colours might be available when released). At the bottom front some branding appears to have been whitewashed to avoid revealing the devices’ true identity. As well as these front and back side views of the new Google Pixel handsets, a potential starting price has also been shared with the standard sized Pixel supposedly costing $649 (approximately £500). Some reported specs on the larger Pixel XL include 5.5-inch QHD display with 2560 x 1440 pixel resolution, Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor, Adreno 530 GPU with 4GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage, expandable. A 13-megapixel main camera and 3,450mAh battery are expected, and both the Pixel and Pixel XL will be the debut platforms for Google’s new Android N (7.1) operating system.

More News PPC 20 Sep 16 | Owen Gill Facebook0 Linkedin594 Google+44 Twitter 638 As an agency, we use both Google AdWords and Bing Ads for our clients as standard practice. We see mixed result across both platforms, depending on the account we’re working on, so it’s difficult to identify trends in the differences between the two networks, when we’re trying to optimise campaigns. Because both networks are treated differently, unless using an ad-exchange, it’s rare that like-for-like campaigns across the networks mirror each other in terms of set-up. So, when a new client shared their concerns about Bing advertising proving expensive from them in the past, I recommended that we trialled a new campaign structure that was identical to those that were already working on Google. Once this was agreed, three campaigns were created in Bing which mirrored the three that were enabled in Google AdWords. This approach doesn’t always work, however it was a good starting point in this case as the Bing activity was failing to meet its objectives. After running all campaigns simultaneously for 45 days, the results were analysed and the difference between the two networks was significant. The scenario The trial ran for 45 days between the 28th July 2016 and 10th September 2016. There were three campaigns in each of the networks which were identical in their set-up, bidding strategy and landing page experience. The only noticeable difference was the spend on each of the campaigns. The objective of the trial was to lower the CPA from Bing Ads activity, and match what was being achieved by Google. Results: Conversions: 1. Tracked phone call, 2. Online form submission. Despite the sizable difference in the spend across all campaigns, the cost to generate conversions saw Bing prove itself to be a significantly more economical network. Overall, it was 63.23% cheaper to gain a conversion on Bing compared to Google. After the trial was running for the first 10 days, the results were exceeding expectations, however the concern was whether this performance could be maintained. Not only was this the case, but I found that that the performance became more consistent throughout the time period.

When reviewing standard advert metrics such as CPC, average position and CTR, there were only slight differences, suggesting that ‘where’ and ‘how’ the ads were positioned on the SERPs had little impact on the CPA. It was the conversion rate when users arrived at the website which was so influential. The overall conversion rate for the three Google campaigns was 5.96% compared to Bing which returned a rate of 8.78%. As the same landing pages were used across both networks, it would appear the characteristics and behaviours of Bing users was substantially different from those who used Google. This suggestion isn’t something new as we see performance differences across both networks all the time. However, the results gained from this trial were not even close, and I personally I have yet to come across a case where the difference in performance has been this wide. Going forward, I will be extending the trail over a 90-day period which I hope will provide conclusive evidence of the difference in performance between the two networks for this case study. Takeaway During this trial, Bing produced a far more economical performance than Google, but we know that this isn’t always the case. I, like many PPC managers, have had scenarios where Google has proved to be the most cost-effective network. However, the key takeaway is not to dismiss Bing Ads before giving it a chance. Despite having a much smaller search engine market share, and a less advanced interface than Google’s, I strongly believe it’s worth investing the time and effort in running some Bing Ad activity. You might gain similar, or even better, results. Owen Gill is a Digital Marketing Executive at the Nottingham UK based agency, Hallam Internet.

Ballot 118 was passed on 16th October 2014, but WoSign were unable to update their systems until March 5th 2015, nearly five months later. This seems like a surprisingly long delay for a relatively simple change, given how quickly WoSign have been able to update their systems in other cases.     − The fact that WoSign declared this on their audit strongly suggests that WoSign were unaware that they were issuing certificates against a SHOULD NOT (i.e. this was not done after carefully weighing and understanding the full implications) and decided to correct the situation when informed. If they had been doing this in full knowledge of the consequences, and the extension into 2017 was intentional, they would not have agreed to revoke all the certificates before 31st December 2016. So while this is not a BR violation , it speaks to their control over their issuance process. + However, as noted above, this is not a BR violation.       ==Issue F: Certs Identical Except For NotBefore (Mar 2015)==   ==Issue F: Certs Identical Except For NotBefore (Mar 2015)== Line 42: Line 46:   ===WoSign Response===   ===WoSign Response===     − This issue has been raised with WoSign, and we await their response. + This issue is covered in WoSign 's [https://www.wosign.com/report/WoSign_Incident_Final_Report_09162016.pdf final incident report]. They explain that there are 16 examples, and it happens when their Certificate Management System loses contact with a signing server during a transaction, and so tries the other one, but both signing servers issue a certificate. One was sent to the subscriber, and the other was stored in their records, and then logged to CT when they logged all their certs.   +     + WoSign has since updated their system to use better locking.   +     + ===Further Comments and Conclusions===   +     + Issuing two different certs with the same serial number is a violation of the RFC, but the impact of this bug is minimal.       ==Issue H: Duplicate Serial Numbers (Apr 2015)==   ==Issue H: Duplicate Serial Numbers (Apr 2015)== Line 57: Line 67:   We understand that remediation action was taken by WoSign to revoke those certificates in a timely manner.

They explain that there were two bugs which led to the same result - one involving a system which did not understand serial numbers with leading zeroes, and the other a race condition.       ===Further Comments===   ===Further Comments===       This last auditor statement ("follow up action was also conducted to prevent the recurrence of the incident") is relevant given later issues involving duplicate serial numbers.   This last auditor statement ("follow up action was also conducted to prevent the recurrence of the incident") is relevant given later issues involving duplicate serial numbers.   +   + It's not clear how "a system bug with the serial number generation, generating a serial number starting with “0” in the first left position" combined with "the signing system had a bug that didn’t know how to deal with this kind of serial number" could lead to duplicate serial numbers. Further clarification has been requested on this point.   +   + This incident is unfortunate and an RFC violation, but it was detected fairly promptly (albeit not by WoSign themselves) and fixed.       ==Issue J: Various BR Violations (Apr 2015)==   ==Issue J: Various BR Violations (Apr 2015)== Line 80: Line 96:   WoSign resolved this promptly at the time by a mix of changes to practice and changes to [https://www.wosign.com/policy/wosign-policy-1-2-11.pdf their CPS] (new versions 1.2.10 and 1.2.11).   WoSign resolved this promptly at the time by a mix of changes to practice and changes to [https://www.wosign.com/policy/wosign-policy-1-2-11.pdf their CPS] (new versions 1.2.10 and 1.2.11).     − This issue was included in Google's report to Mozilla in August 2016 but not listed in the original public discussion.

The statement that "WoSign and StartCom [are] two companies operate[d] and managed independently" is hard to square with the fact that the same person is sole director of StartCom and CEO of WoSign. Also, there is technical evidence that StartCom are now using a large part of WoSign's issuance infrastructure.       ==Issue S: Backdated SHA-1 Certs (January 2016)==   ==Issue S: Backdated SHA-1 Certs (January 2016)== Line 283: Line 321:   ===WoSign Response===   ===WoSign Response===     − This issue has been raised with WoSign, and we await their response. + This issue is covered in WoSign 's [https://www.wosign.com/report/WoSign_Incident_Final_Report_09162016.pdf final incident report].

"Issue -2") Between 16th January 2015 and 5th March 2015, WoSign issued 1,132 SHA-1 certificates whose validity extended beyond 1st January 2017. This is documented in their BR audit. Section 7.1.3 of the BRs says: Effective 16 January 2015, CAs SHOULD NOT issue Subscriber Certificates utilizing the SHA‐1 algorithm with an Expiry Date greater than 1 January 2017. So this requirement is a SHOULD NOT. RFC 2119 states: 4. SHOULD NOT This phrase, or the phrase "NOT RECOMMENDED" mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the particular behavior is acceptable or even useful, but the full implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed before implementing any behavior described with this label. This means that this issue does not represent a violation of the BRs. WoSign Response WoSign chose to declare this to their auditors on their WebTrust audit. The auditors state: We understand that WoSign has established procedures and implemented controls to ensure that the aforementioned SSL subscriber certificates would be revoked on or before 31 December 2016. This issue is also covered in WoSign's final incident report. Further Comments and Conclusion WoSign say that they were aware that they were doing this, and that the cause was a delay in implementing the changes from CAB Forum ballot 118. Ballot 118 was passed on 16th October 2014, but WoSign were unable to update their systems until March 5th 2015, nearly five months later. This seems like a surprisingly long delay for a relatively simple change, given how quickly WoSign have been able to update their systems in other cases. However, as noted above, this is not a BR violation. Issue F: Certs Identical Except For NotBefore (Mar 2015) WoSign issued two certificates in March 2015. These certificates are identical in all ways (including their serial numbers) except for their notBefore dates, which are 37 seconds apart. Cert 1 Cert 2 WoSign Response This issue is covered in WoSign's final incident report. They explain that there are 16 examples, and it happens when their Certificate Management System loses contact with a signing server during a transaction, and so tries the other one, but both signing servers issue a certificate. One was sent to the subscriber, and the other was stored in their records, and then logged to CT when they logged all their certs. WoSign has since updated their system to use better locking. Further Comments and Conclusions Issuing two different certs with the same serial number is a violation of the RFC, but the impact of this bug is minimal. Issue H: Duplicate Serial Numbers (Apr 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue X") Between 9th April 2015 and 14th April 2015, WoSign issued 392 certificates with duplicate serial numbers, across a handful of different serial numbers. Here is one example. This is documented in their most recent BR audit. WoSign Response The audit report says: We understand that remediation action was taken by WoSign to revoke those certificates in a timely manner. Incident investigation with root cause analysis was conducted and relevant result was documented in relevant incident report. Follow up action was also conducted to prevent the recurrence of the incident. This issue is also covered in WoSign's final incident report. They explain that there were two bugs which led to the same result - one involving a system which did not understand serial numbers with leading zeroes, and the other a race condition. Further Comments This last auditor statement ("follow up action was also conducted to prevent the recurrence of the incident") is relevant given later issues involving duplicate serial numbers. It's not clear how "a system bug with the serial number generation, generating a serial number starting with “0” in the first left position" combined with "the signing system had a bug that didn’t know how to deal with this kind of serial number" could lead to duplicate serial numbers. Further clarification has been requested on this point. This incident is unfortunate and an RFC violation, but it was detected fairly promptly (albeit not by WoSign themselves) and fixed. Issue J: Various BR Violations (Apr 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue -1") On April 3rd, 2015, WoSign was contacted by Google, who were concerned about Baseline Requirements violations in recently-issued certificates from WoSign. Instead of specifying the violations directly, Google asked WoSign to check their certificates against their CPS. The following list of problems is a combination of those found by WoSign themselves and those pointed out later by Google: Incorrect or missing policy OIDs in all or most subscriber certificates; CPS required use of obscure "Issuer Alternative Name" field which was not being used; Inclusion of information in the Subject of the certificate (an advert) which was not validated subscriber information, and which contained a domain name, violating section 7.1.4.2 of the BRs; The CPS documentation of validity periods did not match what was happening in practice; CPS required compliance only with RFC 2459 instead of the more restrictive RFC 5280. Google noted that many of these issues should have been caught by a competent auditor. WoSign's auditors at the time were Ernst and Young (Hong Kong). WoSign Response WoSign resolved this promptly at the time by a mix of changes to practice and changes to their CPS (new versions 1.2.10 and 1.2.11). This issue was included in Google's report to Mozilla in August 2016 but not listed in the original public discussion. This issue is covered in WoSign's final incident report. Further Comments WoSign acted quickly to resolve the issues, but this issue perhaps demonstrates that their CPS was not a definition of their practice, but more a document to be updated post-hoc to match changes made to their operations. Mozilla documentation related to auditor errors states that: When egregious mistakes were overlooked by the auditor, or there are a significant number of oversights, or the auditor did not notice BR compliance problems with the root or intermediate certificates, then the CA must resolve the issues and be re-audited. For the re-audit the CA can either get re-audited by a different auditor, or have the current auditor provide an immediate plan for correction and compliance, and then present a mid-term partial audit following that plan. In either case, the auditor must provide documentation about steps they are taking to avoid making the same mistakes in future audits. If the auditor fails to assure Mozilla that they have corrected the deficiencies in their auditing process, then their standing as a trusted auditor for the Mozilla root program may be jeopardized. As Mozilla was not aware of this issue at the time, we were unable to make a judgement on whether these issues rose to an appropriate level of severity to require this response. There is also the question of whether Mozilla wishes to continue to accept audits from an auditor who misses CPS violations covering such a large proportion of the certificate corpus. Issue L: Any Port (Jan - Apr 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue 0") From Jan 10th to to April 23rd 2015, WoSign's certificate issuance system for their free certificates allowed the applicant to choose any port for validation. Once validation had been completed, WoSign would issue certificates for that domain. A researcher was able to obtain a certificate for a university by opening a high-numbered port (>50,000) and getting WoSign to use that port for validation of control. This problem was reported to Google, and thence to WoSign and resolved. Mozilla only became aware of it recently. Before the recent passage of Ballot 169 in the CAB Forum, which limits the ports and paths which can be used, the Baseline Requirements said that one acceptable method of domain validation was "Having the Applicant demonstrate practical control over the FQDN by making an agreed‐upon change to information found on an online Web page identified by a uniform resource identifier containing the FQDN". This method therefore did not violate the letter of the BRs. However, Mozilla considers the basic security knowledge that ports over 1024 are unprivileged should have led all CAs not to accept validations of domain control on such ports, even when not documented in the BRs. The misissuance issue was not reported to Mozilla by WoSign as it should have been. Section 1 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Enforcement Policy says: "When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root compromise, it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and the Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs should be followed." This misissuance issue did not turn up on WoSign's subsequent BR audit. WoSign Response 2016-08-25: "We are searching our database to try to find if any mis-issued cert is issued." 2016-08-25: "For BR auditor, I think this issue is too technical that fewer auditor can find out this problem." List of crt.sh links to certificates involved - total 72. Richard Wang said: "We checked our system, the certificates issued related using higher level port website control validation is totally 72 certificates. To be clear, those certificates are validated by website control validation method that using other port except 80 and 443." 2016-09-04: Official issue report. This issue is also covered in WoSign's final incident report. Further Comments and Conclusions It is the responsibility of the CA to disclose issues to its auditors, not for the auditor to discover them. WoSign was aware of this, because some of the issues in this document were disclosed to auditors and included in their report. The completeness of WoSign's list of 72 certificates was called into question by a discussion participant who testified that his certificate was validated using port 8080 but does not appear in WoSign's list. In response, Richard said that in fact their system did not directly record the port used for validation, and so he could not guarantee that the list was complete. However, the final incident report still gives the impression that WoSign was able to generate a complete list. WoSign has since stopped doing website validation; if they had continued, better logging of the process would have been necessary. The logs they were keeping while using this process were clearly inadequate. Issue N: Additional Domain Errors (June 2015) (a.k.a. "Issue 1") In June 2015, an applicant found some problems with WoSign's free certificate service. There were actually two bugs, which we will denote N1 and N2. Bug N1 was an issue where someone proving control of <subdomain>.example.tld also was given a cert covering example.tld. Bug N2 was an issue where arbitrary domains can be added to an existing request after validation. The reporter proved that there was a problem in two ways. They accidentally discovered that there was a problem when trying to get a certificate for med.ucf.edu and mistakenly also applied for www.ucf.edu, which was approved. They then used their control of schrauger.github.com/schrauger.github.io to get a cert for github.com, github.io, and www.github.io. They also obtained another github cert using a different subdomain of github.io. These are both, in fact, instances of bug N2. WoSign discovered the github misissuances due to a post-issuance review the following day, triggered by "github" being on their list of high-value domains. Those certs were revoked. However, no further investigation was performed, and several other certificates were misissued subsequently. The bugs were fixed two months later, on August 10th, in an unrelated major update. Recently, the reporter of the issue got in touch with Google to note that the ucf.edu cert still had not been revoked almost a year later. The lack of revocation of the ucf.edu certificate strongly suggests that WoSign either did not or could not search their issuance databases for other occurrences of the same problem. Mozilla considers such a search a basic part of the response to disclosure of a vulnerability which causes misissuance, and expects CAs to keep records detailed enough to make it possible. The misissuance issue was not reported to Mozilla by WoSign as it should have been. Section 1 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Enforcement Policy says: "When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root compromise, it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and the Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs should be followed." This misissuance issue did not turn up on WoSign's subsequent BR audit. WoSign Response 2016-08-25: "For BR auditor, I think this issue is too technical that fewer auditor can find out this problem." List of crt.sh links to certificates involved - total 33. 2016-09-04: Official issue report. The report explains the two bugs, N1 and N2. WoSign classifies the misissuances as 21 N1 and 12 N2. This issue is also covered in WoSign's final incident report. Bug N1 N1 allowed an applicant to get a certificate for the base domain if they were able to prove control of any subdomain. According to WoSign, this was caused by an engineer misunderstanding the rule that if a base domain was validated, the "www" variant could be added for free. He instead applied the rule in the other direction. Bug N2 Issue N2 is described in the report as follows: This mis-issued certificate was a system vulnerability that when the subscriber finished the domain validation, they can add any domain before submitting this order to system. Looking at their list of misissued domains in the report, this really does mean "any domain". For example, a cert where the owner validated "netwi.ru" was able to add "mx.idisk.su", an entirely different domain, without validating it. This effectively bypasses domain validation for any attacker who owns a domain of their own. Further Comments and Conclusions An arbitrary unvalidated ownership domain misissuance bug is an extremely serious flaw, particularly if it's available in a normal workflow. The report seems to suggest an "issue first, ask questions later" approach whereby a cert is issued to the subscriber even if it is flagged as questionable, and the remediation mechanism is revocation rather than lack of issuance. Furthermore, their validation team works 9-5, so an applicant could have many hours to abuse a misissued certificate before it was discovered. Although it seems like the system issued a certificate which did not match what was validated, this was not investigated further. The report says: "the employee treated it as an unusual case that did not reported it as a bug." This is amazing, if true. If WoSign's employees don't think that misissuing a certificate is a big deal, something is quite badly wrong. The report seems surprised that the applicant did not follow the WoSign Terms of Use. I would not expect an actual attacker to care about the WoSign Terms of Use. The certificate involved here were all clearly misissued; even if the person could have proved control of the parent domain, they did not do so during the process. Therefore, failure to revoke these certificates immediately (as WoSign argued it didn't need to during the public discussion) constitutes a further BR violation, as per Section 4.9.1.1 of the BRs, in particular, item 4 and item 9. WoSign has since stopped doing website control validation entirely. However, that does not decrease the seriousness of the bug/feature. It also raises the question of how such a feature could make it through review, testing and QA. Issue P: Use of SM2 Algorithm (Nov 2015) In November 2015, WoSign issued two certificates that have subject public keys which are for the SM2 algorithm. SM2 is an elliptic-curve-based algorithm but it does not use the US NIST P-256, P-384, or P-521 curves. The CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements section 6.1.5 requires that only these three curves be used for elliptic curve keys in certs covered by the BRs. In addition to including subjects keys using unapproved parameters, it seems these each share their serial number with another certificate for the same subject. 1st SM2 cert in crt.sh; cert with same serial number in crt.sh 2nd SM2 cert in crt.sh; cert with same serial number in crt.sh Secondly, for the first pair of certs, the validity period is 4 years, which is 9 months longer than allowed by the BRs. WoSign Response Richard Wang: "This is another case that we will include it in our report. We issued two test cert using SM2 algorithm that used the same serial number as the RSA cert (same subject) to test if we can setup a gateway that install this two type cert, it can shake hand automatically using different cert based on the browser algorithm support." (Unable to find this message in the groups.google.com archive.) This issue is also covered in WoSign's final incident report. Further Comments There are plenty of ways of testing this scenario without using public roots - and, in fact, WoSign has updated their systems to avoid issuing test certificates from public roots in future. We note that Symantec was penalised in late 2015 for issuing non-BR-compliant test certificates in their publicly-trusted certificate hierarchies. Their problems were first revealed in September, and one big discussion of these problems happened in m.d.s.policy starting on 13th October 2015. All of these dates are prior to WoSign's test certificate misissuances. Issue R: Purchase of StartCom (Nov 2015) WoSign purchased the CA "StartCom" and did not disclose the transaction as a change of ownership, which we believe violates section 5 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Maintenance Policy. Furthermore, when this clause was brought to their attention, they denied that any changes fell under it, and they attempted to suppress further information about the ownership transfer when it was brought to the community's attention. Full details can be found in the post in mozilla.dev.security.policy. WoSign Response Richard Wang writes: "An announcement and disclosure will be made shortly pending completion of the business transaction. We can provide the proof documents to Mozilla to show this transaction is not finished if Mozilla think it is necessary." On 2016-09-19, WoSign issued a press release saying that they have "made an equity investment" in StartCom CA. Further Comments and Conclusion Mozilla has confirmed with a Hebrew-speaking lawyer that, as far as the Israeli company authorities are concerned, the transaction which completed the chain to give WoSign 100% ownership of StartCom completed on November 1st 2015. We maintain that this is the date at which the ownership change should have been disclosed to Mozilla. In addition, WoSign's press release about their "equity investment" seems to be economical with the truth; WoSign owns 100% of StartCom. The statement that "WoSign and StartCom [are] two companies operate[d] and managed independently" is hard to square with the fact that the same person is sole director of StartCom and CEO of WoSign. Also, there is technical evidence that StartCom are now using a large part of WoSign's issuance infrastructure. Issue S: Backdated SHA-1 Certs (January 2016) WoSign has issued certificates after January 1st 2016 but backdated the notBefore date to be in December 2015. This has the effect of avoiding the blocks in browsers regarding SHA-1 certs issued after January 1st 2016. The number of certs affected is probably 67, but may be a few more or less. The three certificates below have notBefore dates in Dec 2015, have signatures over SHA-1 hashes and have embedded SCTs which are dated after January 1, 2016. Domain notBefore notAfter SCT Timestamp yffsc.com Dec 19 20:37:06 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Jan 4 10:11:27 2016 GMT congfubao.com Dec 20 08:29:51 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Jan 5 05:52:47 2016 GMT my.xbniao.com Dec 20 07:48:31 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Jan 18 05:33:21 2016 GMT Because these SCTs are embedded, they must have been created before the final certificate was signed, and therefore the final certificate must have been signed in January - on or after January 18th, for the third one. These are the only certs for which cryptographic proof of backdating is available. However, other strong circumstantial evidence suggests that backdating is more prevalent. Firstly, around 12th May 2015, WoSign started using a new certificate template for some of their SHA-1 issuances. This has a fixed notAfter date of 2016-12-29T16:00:00Z (i.e. midnight on 29th/30th December, CST). This may have been a (sensible) move to prevent accidentally issuing SHA-1 certs which ran into 2017. We have found 939 SHA-1 certificates with this fixed notAfter date, including the above three. Certificates issued using this template almost exclusively have notBefore dates on working days in China, suggesting they are issued by explicit WoSign employee action. All of them have notBefores between Monday and Friday, except for 13 on a Saturday and 66 on a Sunday. Of those 66, 4 have notBefores on 2015-09-06, a Sunday which was, unusually, a working day in China. The other 62 all have notBefores on 2015-12-20, which was a Sunday, and not a working day in China. This suggests that, for these 62, the notBefore does not reflect the actual issuance date. For these 62, the notBefore date is some time between midnight and midnight on December 20th 2015, China time (+0800). (This pattern fits a system where code adjusted the date, but not the time, prior to issuance.) Here are five more examples: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Secondly, some certificates which are suspected to be backdated were issued at the same time as SHA-256 certificates for the same domain; the timestamps on the SHA-256 certificates are more likely to be the accurate ones. One example is for congfubao.com, where there is a SHA-256 cert with a notBefore of 5th January and an SCT timestamp of 5th January, 17 seconds later than the SCT timestamp in the backdated SHA-1 cert. The simplest explanation is that both certs were issued together, on January 5th. Other pairs include for ebank.pcnkbank.com (SHA-1, SHA-256) and mail.gd.gov.cn (SHA-1, SHA-256). Lastly, of the 62 suspect certs, there are three more certs with embedded SCTs where the gap between the notBefore date and the SCT date is multiple days (i.e. they were backdated, and this is cryptographically provable) but where the SCT date is nevertheless (just) before 1st January 2016, which means the backdating would not have the effect of avoiding browser blocks. Domain notBefore notAfter SCT Timestamp passport.huayingjuhe.com Dec 20 03:40:31 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Dec 31 10:24:34 2015 GMT puxbao.com Dec 20 07:49:25 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Dec 31 10:30:03 2015 GMT modai.cc Dec 20 12:02:09 2015 GMT Dec 29 16:00:00 2016 GMT Dec 31 10:20:17 2015 GMT The issuance of backdated certificates is not forbidden by Mozilla policy, but is included in Mozilla's list of Problematic Practices. It says "Minor tweaking for technical compatibility reasons is accepted, but backdating certificates in order to avoid some deadline or code-enforced restriction is not." The Baseline Requirements, section 7.1.3, say: Effective 1 January 2016, CAs MUST NOT issue any new Subscriber certificates or Subordinate CA certificates using the SHA‐1 hash algorithm. (Thanks to Thijs Alkemade of Computest for much of the information in this section.) WoSign Response This issue is covered in WoSign's final incident report. Of the 64 certificates they consider, WoSign attribute 6 to a dual-issuance bug, 9 they say are not problematic because they were issued on December 31st 2015, 2 are the mis-issued certs relating to Issue V, and the other 47 are "normal SHA-1 orders". Further Comments and Conclusion Mozilla is seeking further information on the details in WoSign's report and will make further comment at a later date. Issue T: alicdn.com Misissuance (June 2016) A certificate has been issued in June 2016 to alicdn.com which was not requested by the owner of that domain. The domains in question currently use certificates from Symantec. Cert on Github Gist Cert on crt.sh WoSign Response This issue is covered in WoSign's final incident report. WoSign assert that they completed the domain control checks correctly. Further Comments and Conclusion The owners of alicdn.com have confirmed directly to Mozilla that this incident was caused by an attacker being able to control content on their domain. We would have some concerns with how WoSign's systems validated website control. However, they no longer support this method. This "misissuance" was possible only because alicdn.com was, for some period of time, controlled by an attacker. Therefore, no blame can be attributed to WoSign for the misissuance itself. Issue V: StartEncrypt (July 2016) (a.k.a. "Issue 2") In July 2016, it became clear that there was some problems with the StartEncrypt automatic issuance service recently deployed by the CA StartCom. This was a StartCom-branded service and was not publicised as being able to issue certificates from WoSign. However, changing a simple API parameter in the POST request on the submission page changed the intermediate/root certificate to which the resulting certificate chained up. The value "2" made a certificate signed by "StartCom Class 1 DV Server CA", "1" selected "WoSign CA Free SSL Certificate G2" and "0" selected "CA 沃通根证书", another root certificate owned by WoSign and trusted by Firefox. A security investigator used the value "1", and acquired two certificates which had notBefore dates (usage start date) of 20th December 2015, and which were signed using the SHA-1 checksum algorithm. Cert 1, Cert 2. The issuance of certificates using SHA-1 has been banned by the Baseline Requirements since January 1st, 2016. Browsers, including Firefox, are enforcing this - in Firefox's case, for publicly-trusted CAs, since Firefox 48, released on 1st August 2016. The issuance of backdated certificates is not forbidden, but is included in Mozilla's list of Problematic Practices. It says "Minor tweaking for technical compatibility reasons is accepted, but backdating certificates in order to avoid some deadline or code-enforced restriction is not." WoSign deny that their code backdated the certificates in order to avoid browser-based restrictions - they say "this date is the day we stop to use this code". If that is true, it is not clear to us how StartCom came to be able to call WoSign code that WoSign itself had abandoned. The misissuance issue was not reported to Mozilla by WoSign as it should have been. Section 1 of the Mozilla CA Certificate Enforcement Policy says: "When a serious security concern is noticed, such as a major root compromise, it should be treated as a security-sensitive bug, and the Mozilla Policy for Handling Security Bugs should be followed." WoSign Response 2016-09-04: Official issue report. This issue is also covered in WoSign's final incident report. Further Comments This issue does not paint a picture of careful software development practices and quality assurance - having unused code around capable of issuing BR-violating certificates does not seem like responsible practice. WoSign assert that the fact that the cert was SHA-1 was a "SHA-1 parameter request" - i.e. the SHA-1-ness was caused by the requester. However, as we understand it, the request was the same as a request which produced a SHA-256 certificate from StartCom, except for the change of the API parameter. Therefore, the SHA-1-ness was WoSign's responsibility, not part of the request. The question of why StartCom was able to trigger certificate-issuance code which WoSign has stopped developing and maintaining is also still open. Cross Signing It is important background information to know which WoSign roots are cross-signed by other trusted or previously-trusted roots.

Google has made sharing photos much easier. Till the update, sharing was a long process involving selecting the photos in a gallery, selecting share, choosing an application to share over, and then selecting the contacts to share the photos with. Now a step is removed from the process. Users simply select the contacts directly, after choosing the photos to be shared, and Google takes care of the sharing. The photos get delivered automatically to the contacts. The first preference is sharing over the Google Photos app itself. Other users who have the app installed, will get an alert within the app. If the user does not have the Google Photos app installed, Google will next look for an associated email address. The photos will be delivered to this email address. If there is no associated email address with the contact, then Google will simply send the images in a url over a text message.

Comments Computerworld | Sep 20, 2016 3:50 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Smartphones Personal Technology Mobile & Wireless Google Comments It's Tuesday, so that means an announcement for an upcoming tech announcement, and leaked photos of said announcement. Phew, you got that? If you're still following along, Google has finally (somewhat) confirmed that it will be debuting its new smartphones at an event next month. Pictures were leaked earlier Monday. So how did Google confirm the event? With a video, of course. In IT Blogwatch, we watch it all unfold. How do we know the smartphones will be announced next month? John Anon has the background: The Pixel and the Pixel XL are coming...Google confirmed this thanks to a new video...simply entitled “Google: Oct.4”...the whole video revolves around a shape shifting (tablet-like) design which eventually adopts the shape of a smartphone...this is as good as a confirmation [we] will likely get. ... What is equally as interesting...the video description...links to a page where you can sign up to be notified of any developments regarding the event. However...this...one...comes listed under the domain “madeby.google.com.” So what can we expect from these new phones? Chance Miller is in the know: The Pixel and Pixel XL were leaked in...pictures earlier...showing off the 5-inch and 5.5-inch displays and each device’s front facing camera, earpiece, and ambient light sensor. On the back of both devices was a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor and glass panel...camera and camera flash. What about pricing? Do we know anything there? Ryan Whitwam fills us in: A trusted source tells us...the smaller Pixel phone will start at $649. That means the Pixel XL could be even more...This will most likely be for the base storage model, presumably 32GB. ... There will be Pixel financing options available from Google...The financing won't require Fi, but we don't know in which markets it will be offered. There will...be accidental damage coverage plus another year of warranty available for...$99 for Pixel and $119 for Pixel XL. Google will sell a variety of clear and colored Google-branded cases for each phone. Is Google going to annoucne anything else at this event? Ron Amadeo has the details: A report...claimed October 4th would see the launch of the two Pixel phones, along with Google Home, the company's answer to the Amazon Echo; Daydream VR, the company's answer to the Samsung Gear VR; and a Chromecast capable of 4K playback. One more question. Aren't Google's phone's part of the Nexus line? Avaneed Pandey says that Nexus is no more: A recent report...confirms that Google is...dropping the Nexus name for its Android smartphones, ending a series that began with Nexus One in 2009. And...the company has also "suspended" Project Ara -- its plan to build a modular smartphone with interchangeable components.

They hit Premier Partner Status once again and dedicate their accomplishments to their clients, employees, and the change management program that Cloudbakers has become so well-known for; it's Cloudbakers' desire of turning projects into partnerships that pave the way to ongoing success. Chicago, Illinois (PRWEB) September 20, 2016 The Google for Work Partner Program is made up of high-performing, dedicated, and expert organizations that are constantly re-evaluated and regularly exert a passion to stay ahead of the curve. Cloudbakers takes their partner status very seriously, recognizing that the Mid-Market needs to be fully confident in their Cloud Solution Provider (CSP). With that, Cloudbakers is pleased to announce that they have again achieved Premier Partner Status within the Google for Work Partner Program. This is the most elite partner tier Google for Work offers. Delivering the highest caliber of services to present and future Google Apps and Google Cloud Platform users is what Cloudbakers was built around; their Premier Status guarantees this quality of service will continue going forward. “When someone puts their business in your hands, they want to know they’ve made the right choice, with an experienced partner,” explains Mitch Greenwald, CEO & Founder. “The Premier Partner Status is an easy way to signify that.” Without a doubt, the Premier Partner Badge is one of the first things many companies look for when seeking out a CSP. Mitch continues, “One of our founding principles is to have strong partnerships with both our partners and our clients. This Premier status is an example of our commitment to that principle. Cloudbakers’ cause is to ‘Connect with People and Contribute to their Purpose’ – by people, we mean our clients, our partners, our team.” The Bakers look forward to another year of working with the Google team to bring companies into the Cloud. ABOUT CLOUDBAKERS Cloudbakers brings the human element to cloud technologies, from strategy planning to the full transition to the cloud. Whether your company is migrating email platforms to Google Apps, customizing your CRM for a more productive sales workflow, or building a new internal application, you don’t have to do it alone.

Welcome to the future, Pokéhunters – and very possibly, a full Pokédex. Ever wished you could get an alert when a Pokémon you haven't caught yet is near your home? If you live in a smart abode, it's easier than you might think. Here's my guide to using smart lighting (in this case, Philips Hue) and IFTTT to turn your dwelling into one big Pokémon tracker. Before you begin, you’ll need... A virtual private server (VPS) that will run Python (I used Linode.com) Philips Hue lights, with a Philips account set up for remote access A dedicated Twitter account to tweet Pokémon sightings A phone number (for verifying a few things as you set them up) A fresh Google account Watch: Pokémon Go tips and tricks Setting up a custom Pokémon Map account The first step is to download the Pokémon Go Desktop Map Application. This application talks to the actual Niantic servers to see which Pokémon are nearby. It requires a real Pokémon account to do this, but you don’t want to use your main account in case anything goes wrong, as accounts can be blocked if they're deemed to have 'hacked' the game. Still with me? Great. Register a new Pokémon Trainers Club account on the Pokémon website and use the account briefly in the actual Pokémon Go app to catch your first Pokémon, then log out again. You need to do this, as when the custom app we’re going to build talks to the Pokémon servers, they need to think it’s a real person playing the game. At this stage, you also need to register on Google Maps to get access to the Google Maps API. This API talks to the Pokémon Go Desktop Map Application to get location data and share it with you in a useful way. This is what the app looks like when it's running: Related: Best Pokémon Go maps and trackers Getting the app to talk to Twitter When you download the Pokémon Go Desktop Map Application, it comes with a bunch of files. You need to edit the customLog.py script to run a program from the Python Twitter library to tweet from the special Twitter account you set up earlier. This script checks if the Pokémon is nearby and, if so, tweets about it. (You’ll need to register a custom app to have access to your account via Twitter's OAuth functionality.) To keep things interesting, I edited the Pokémon data file built into the desktop app (pokemon.min.json) to set the rarity of the Pokémon we aren’t interested in to ‘dull’ and set the script to check that before tweeting. So it only tweets if a Pokémon we don’t have appears nearby. We’ve set the radius to 100m for now. This actually sounds a lot more complicated than it is – all you're really doing is adding a couple of extra lines to Pokémon Go Desktop Map’s customLog.py, editing the list of Pokémon you're interested in, and fiddling around with a Twitter account. The next thing to do is upload your new custom Python script to your server and it should start tweeting away happily.

Then tell it you want to make a custom recipe using Twitter. It will ask for your personal Twitter account details and, after it has access, you can tell it to trigger when a specific, different account tweets. Then it’s easy to plug it into Hue. IFTTT just needs to be given access to your Hue hub and you're away. You can set it to shine any colour you like but I started with red. Now just wait until a Pokémon is nearby and the light show will begin. I've tested it for a few weeks now and it totally works, though you should warn guests that the lights may flash, otherwise they'll think they're in an episode of Stranger Things. Related: 26 best IFTTT recipes Possible future improvements 1) It would be possible to add a second account so that near-ish Pokémon flash orange, leaving only super-nearby ones to flash red. 2) Or you could build one to flash colours, so if a water Pokémon appears nearby the lights go blue. Hue supports 16 million colours so we could be incredibly specific. 3) You can use Hue to tell if you’re at home and only flash then, sparing the cat any Pokémon alerts when we’re not around because he doesn’t play Pokémon. He's a cat. 4) The Hue currently turns the lights red, or flashes forever, so you have to manually reset it to normal mode. It would be good to have it reset when the Pokémon disappears or after, say, 5 minutes 5) The next project would be to set up some sort of alert if the gym nearby is under attack, and even indicate the strength of the defenders. We'll work on that next. 6) You can remove the need for Twitter to talk to the Hue lights, but it’s quite handy seeing a map of where to go for the Pokémon.

Next Google Pixel phones are almost here: Livestream, price and ‘official’ leaks By Chris Smith on Sep 20, 2016 at 6:50 AM Email @chris_writes Mobile Share This Story Tweet Like Share Submit Shop ▾ There’s one more exciting phone hitting stores this year, the Google Pixel series. Google is expected to discontinue its Nexus program this year and replace it with the Pixel. The company wants to make high-end mobile products that will compete against the iPhone better, but Google is still hiring third-party OEMs to manufacture the actual phones. We saw numerous Google Pixel (Sailfish) and Pixel XL (Marlin) leaks so far, so it’s time to check out some “official” ones. DON’T MISS: Android user switches to iPhone 7 from pure Android and has some surprising opinions Launch date Just as some reports said, Google will unveil the new Pixel phones on October 4th. The company will livestream the event on YouTube as well, and the company is already promoting the mobile event on YouTube and social media. Google is still trying to be rather cryptic about things, just check the following clip. But it’s more than clear that the entire thing will be about new mobile hardware, the kind of devices that hardcore Android fans expect. Moreover, Google has also put up a madeby.google.com site which pretty much confirms we’re going to have a new phone in stores in the near future, one that’s made by Google — well, technically, it’s made by HTC, but who’s counting. And from the looks of it, this Pixel phone should offer us a great camera experience. 🤗 https://t.co/NrjmQF1vHM — Nexus (@googlenexus) September 20, 2016 Google leaks If that’s not enough for a spoiler, then you also need to check out the following Nest commercial that features a phone that’s not official yet. Google released this video in the Netherlands, but there are plenty of Android fans over there as well. Check out the clip: Real life photos Okay, so the following images do not come from Google. They’re not official. But Android Police says these are the Google Pixel phones, show side by side in these pictures. As you can see, these devices look just like the handset in the Nest commercial above, complete with that strange sensor setup under the speaker. There are images of the rear side of the phone as well, complete with its ugly side. Mixing glass and aluminum doesn’t look like a great idea. Show me the money Dirt-cheap Nexus phones will be a thing of the past once the Pixel phones arrive. Google is supposedly moving to a new pricing scheme for its phones, and it won’t be pretty. The same Android Police says that Google Pixel prices will start at $649 — that’s the entry price for the small Sailfish. The Pixel XL will cost more, and it’s safe to say that more storage on the Pixel means you’ll pay more than $649 for one. That $649 was previously rumored to be the Pixel XL’s price tag, but it appears that’s not the case anymore. You’ll have to pay more money for a Pixel phablet. However, the site says there’s some good news. There will be Pixel financing options from Google, although it’s not clear what markets swill get them. The phones will be sold from Google, not just carrier partners, and Google will offer accidental damage coverage plus another year of warranty for both phones, priced at $99 (Pixel) and $119 (Pixel XL) Tags: Google, Nexus, Pixel, Pixel XL Source: Android Police (1), (2), (3) Older StoryPrevious Newer StoryNext Trending Sam’s Club full Black Friday 2016 ad leaked: Here are the best deals Best Buy just released an updated Black Friday ad: Here’s what’s new Walmart will give you a chance to buy the NES Classic every day this week NES Classic Edition review: A box of nostalgia Related Articles Hackers needed just 30 seconds to get complete access to the Google Pixel Google Translate just became scarily good New performance tests show just how dominant the iPhone 7 really is BGR Store Certified Ethical Hacker Bootcamp The Black Friday Mac Bundle 2.0 Pay What You Want: White Hat Hacker 2017 Bundle PureVPN: Lifetime Subscription View Comments Hubs Apple You'll have Donald Trump to thank if the iPhone 8 is even more expensive The brand new MacBook Pro beats Microsoft's Surface Book in one key area Android Some Android phones have been covertly sending sensitive user data to China Leaks suggest next year's OnePlus 4 will be the Android phone to beat Mobile T-Mobile starts holiday sales a week early with Magenta Friday You'll have Donald Trump to thank if the iPhone 8 is even more expensive Retail Walmart's pre-Black Friday sale starts right now - here are the best deals so far Amazon Prime is dropping from $99 to $79 for one day only FOLLOW BGR Like BGR on Facebook Follow @BGR on Twitter BGR on Google Plus Follow BGR on LinkedIn BGR ON TWITTER Jonathan S.

However, Google looks set to change that this year by dropping the Nexus branding from its mobile devices and opting instead for the Pixel branding used by its laptop and tablet. It now appears that the company is ready to spill all in terms of the new handsets too. According to Digital Spy, Google took to Twitter to confirm that an announcement around their latest handset is coming on October 4. The short teaser appears to show Google’s iconic search bar transforming into a phone, alongside that aforementioned reveal date. That being said, Google appears to be taking something of a playful approach with the reveal of its latest handset, with that aforementioned teaser running with a background track of “Come and Get Your Love” by Redbone. Google has had that October 4 event penned for a little while now and has been widely expected to show off its latest mobile handsets in San Francisco. Google is also expected to unveil their handsets in a similar way to what Apple did this month, providing a close release date and immediately opening pre-orders for the new devices. Our best look yet at the Pixel and Pixel XL! https://t.co/8tIlQHGkL7 pic.twitter.com/PcL37E2YvW — Android Central (@androidcentral) September 20, 2016 That being said, it doesn’t look like fans of Google will have to wait until October to see the new devices, with the most substantial leaks yet appearing online. According to Android Authority, two new leaked photographs appear to show the Google Pixel and Pixel XL phones side by side. The devices appear to follow the design ethos of Android manufacturer HTC’s phones, which further substantiates previous rumours that this year’s Google designed phones will be manufactured by HTC. The leaked photographs also appear to confirm that the Pixel phone will come in two size variants. The standard Pixel will come with a 5-inch display, whilst the Pixel XL will offer a 5.5-inch variant. At the same time, the two devices are expected to vary in terms of specs, with the larger model expected to pack a more powerful processor over its smaller brother. Otherwise, the devices appear to be largely similar in nature. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6gAYPkFmTz8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> RELATED STORIES ON INQUISITR: Will Samsung Galaxy S8 Be Released Early After Galaxy Note 7 Disaster? iOS 10.0.2: iPhone Operating System Glitches Spark Speculation Of Updated iOS 10 Samsung Share Price Slips $26 Billion Amid Galaxy Note 7 Crisis Google typically reveals most of its new products across either September or October. With that in mind, the October 4 event is also likely to see Google revealing a host of other new products. Expected to make an appearance yet is another new model of the incredibly popular Chromecast, but with this year’s model offering 4K support. Google has so far had a good deal of success with its Chromecast, especially in comparison to the alternative offered by their main competitor Apple, which was forced to reduce the price of its Apple TV last year. Also poised to make an appearance at this year Google event is a new iteration of the Nexus 7. The first and second iterations have provided Apple’s tablets with a good deal of competition, which is a success that Google is looking to imitate with a new Nexus 7 manufactured by Huawei. Google confirms October 4 event, likely for new Pixel phones https://t.co/RHdJbrThMT pic.twitter.com/GdmMCnjEOs — PhoneDog (@PhoneDog) September 20, 2016 Google has plenty in the pipeline in terms of new product launches this autumn. However, undeniably their most exciting upcoming product are those aforementioned Pixel phones. With Apple recently receiving a good deal of criticism for its most recent iPhone reveal, Google will be hoping to pick up users disenchanted with Apple’s latest offering. In ditching the Nexus brand, Google will be hoping to bring a new lease on life to their devices.

Usually, Google Photos users who want to share photos in the app have to call up the iOS Share Sheet and select which app to share through. Photos now offers an arguably faster alternative to that, with a new option that lets users select individual people they want to share media with instead. If the people selected are on Google Photos they get a notification. If the user opts to share by phone number, people get a link to the photos and video via SMS, while email addresses get sent a link from Google Photos. In addition, Google is bringing movie 'creative concepts' to the app that are similar to the Memories feature found in Apple's Photos app on iOS 10. Photos already features automatically generated movies made from users' recently uploaded photos, but the update is introducing new themed movie concepts, such as watching kids grow up, capturing good times during the summer, and for formal events like weddings. Google says it's rolling out the updates today, with the first movie 'creative concepts' coming this week, and more on the way. Google Photos is a free download for iPhone and iPad from the App Store.

ITProPortal Search RSS News Features Analysis Guides Reviews Categories Business Hardware Security Software Mobile Enterprise Cloud Networks Public Sector Startups Web Indonesia's tax office wants Google to pay over $400 million in back taxes By Anthony Spadafora Indonesia's tax office has charged Google with an $18 million fine over the company's tax avoidance in 2015. Shares Google could be facing fees of over $400 million in Indonesia where one of the country's officials has accused the company of tax avoidance. Muhammad Hanif, who works for Indonesia's tax office special cases branch, revealed that the authorities have visited Google and believe the company's tax avoidance has been ongoing over the last five years.     The company had previously turned down a request by the Indonesian government to be audited. Google was then under investigation by the country's tax officials who accused it of failing to pay taxes during the 2015 calendar year. Now the company is facing a fine that is equivalent to four times the taxes it should have paid last year, which amounts to $418 million. If the tax office finds out that Google had avoided paying taxes before 2015, it could face further penalties. A spokesperson for the company defended its position, saying: “Google Indonesia has been incorporated as a local company in Indonesia since 2011. We have been and will continue to cooperate with the government and have paid all applicable taxes in Indonesia.” If Google does find tax-related problems in East Asia then it would be in a similar position to Apple, which was recently accused of skipping out on paying billions in taxes  in Indonesia. Apple itself is facing a great deal of its own difficulties after EU authorities charged the company with a $15.5 billion fee. It is still up in the air regarding if Google will have to pay Indonesia's hefty fee but the situation is one that could motivate other companies to look into their own bank ledgers with clean eyes in order to prevent falling into the same position as Apple and now Google currently find themselves.  Image Credit: Denis Linine / Shutterstock ABOUT THE AUTHOR Anthony Spadafora Anthony currently resides in South Korea where he teaches and experiences Korean technological advances first hand.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google Pixel’s pricing for the 32GB model leaked By R Padla - September 20, 2016 8 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter We’re almost certain this year’s Google Nexus phones will now be part of the Pixel line. The HTC Nexus Sailfish and HTC Nexus Marlin we’ve been featuring the past few months are rumored to be called the Pixel and the Pixel XL. Both devices will soon join the Pixel C which was introduced by Google last year as a premium flagship Android tablet. This move is said to be a rebrand since Google has been using Nexus for years. The new Pixel name signifies some changes in the direction. We don’t know exactly what the search giant wants to prove here but we’re guessing the company simply wants to align its products and services. The Google Pixel and Pixel XL are more than ready to take over the Nexus. Images and details are being leaked left and right. The last set we saw just yesterday, looking very much like the ones captured by Mr. Blurry Cam last week. There are too many photos and renders being shared online and at the same details being sighted on Geekbench. We’re guessing more information will be published before the official launch in October. Android Police’s David Ruddock has been weighing in on the topic, sharing things he knows about the Pixel phones. The Android geek just tweeted that he recently heard information that the “regular 32GB Pixel will start at $649 in the US”. That’s expensive already so obviously the Pixel XL be even “insanely expensive” according to Ruddock–making the two as obvious rivals to Apple’s new iPhone 7.

Coren Obsession Machines with Brains September 20, 2016 Florida's Governor (L) is not so hands off about autonomous vehicles in his state. (Audi) Share Written by Michael J. Coren Obsession Machines with Brains September 20, 2016 In 2012, Google dropped off two self-driving cars near the steps of Florida’s statehouse in Tallahassee. They were there at the behest of a freshly elected Florida state senator, Jeff Brandes. Lawmakers, some with families in tow, stepped into Google’s modified Toyota Priuses. With a Google employee standing by in the driver seat, the cars drove loops around the capital building, and then headed to the freeway, accelerating to 70 mph. No one touched the steering wheel for most of the ride, Brandes recounts. “It was an education campaign to get people to understand that this is the future,” Brandes told Quartz. “This is our generation’s transition from horse-and-buggy to the Model T.” That day in Tallahassee led to a series of laws that has transformed the Sunshine State into the most welcoming place for autonomous vehicles in the country. On April 4, Brandes’ efforts culminated in the the passage of HB 7027, in a unanimous 118-0 vote, ushering in the nations’s first legislation to legalize fully autonomous vehicles on public roads without a driver behind the wheel. Florida is currently the only state that explicitly allows for true self-driving vehicles, says Adam Losey, a senior counsel at Foley and Lardner in Orlando. It puts Florida in position to shape legislation across the rest of the country. “For the moment, Florida is the most important state as far as the legal aspects of autonomous vehicles go,” said John Terwilleger, a Florida business litigation attorney who has studied the state’s AV statutes. “Frequently, the first state to pass legislation becomes the model for the remainder of the country, so it is very possible that Florida’s law will become a model.” The legislative wheels are turning elsewhere. Last year, 16 states introduced legislation related to autonomous vehicles (AV), compared to just six in 2012, reports the National Council of State Legislators. Michigan, Nevada, and California are close behind Florida with their own AV legislation. On Monday (Sept 19), the US Department of Transportation (DOT) released guidelines that cleared away some of the uncertainty around safety standards. The non-binding guidelines leave plenty of room for future regulations, but recommend how driverless cars should respond to failures, protect user privacy, strengthen safety features, and standardize hardware and data protocols. Even cities are pushing ahead. Last week, Pittsburgh mayor Bill Peduto welcomed Uber’s public debut of autonomous vehicles, proclaiming that “when it comes to innovation, regulation never comes first.” For the AV industry, however, clear regulation would be a relief. But the flurry of competing legislation—ranging from Florida’s laissez-faire approach to California’s strict oversight—is causing worries. “Ideally, we’d like to see strong leadership from the federal government, not just to industry but to the states,” says Chan Lieu, a former National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHSTA) official and advisor to the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets, which represents Uber, Lyft, Ford, Google, and Volvo. “We want there to be consistency across all 50 states, so autonomous vehicles don’t run afoul of laws crossing state boundaries.” Today, car and technology companies are operating in a legal grey area. Traditionally, jurisdiction over motor safety was clear: the federal government regulates vehicles, and the states regulate drivers. That dividing line no longer exists. “It’s a new world where the vehicle is the driver,” a DOT spokesman told Quartz. Consider the most basic issues: What exactly is an autonomous vehicle? Who is responsible when it crashes? Are they legal? Quartz asked lawyers around the country those questions. The only consistent answer was, “Nobody knows yet.” What’s certain is that self-driving car experiments are being run on roads where companies have pushed ahead of explicit regulation, or in places like Florida where regulators are welcoming them. The race is on Silicon Valley companies are famous for selectively ignoring regulations, and forcing lawmakers’ hands once public opinion tips in their favor. That strategy has succeeded for companies like Uber, Lyft and Airbnb, which dispatched loyal, voting customers against resistance from incumbent interests around the country. Autonomous vehicles, however, are blazing an opposite route. States have competed with each other to legalize self-driving cars, and worked with companies to craft new legislation. Lawmakers tout AV-friendly credentials despite only preliminary testing, no federal safety standards, and at least one death when a Tesla Model S slammed into a tractor trailer in Florida while using “Autopilot” software. Machines are still safer than a human, maybe. (NTSB via Florida Highway Patrol via AP) One factor, it seems, is economics. California and Nevada rely on the technology sector to provide jobs and money for their states. Google, Uber, and Tesla—all headquartered in California—are pushing hardest for autonomous vehicles. Michigan, too, wants to see Detroit and the entire US auto industry become more than just parts suppliers to Silicon Valley. Then there’s Florida. Florida has raced to become the leader on autonomous vehicle regulation since 2011, largely because of the benefits Brandes says the technology can bring to the state. One motivation, he says, is safety. Of the more than 33,000 motor vehicle deaths in the US each year, about 94% are due to human error. Almost all of them may be preventable with autonomous driving technology, say federal safety officials. The other is the once-in-a-lifetime chance to shape the transformation of American society. Autonomous vehicles promise to succeed where decades of mass-transit and highway construction have failed to slash traffic, cut fossil fuel use (pdf, p xiv), reconnect communities, and reduce the 20% or so of cities now devoted to parking. “I saw this affects the lives of all Floridans, and this was going to solve a lot of our problems,” said Brandes. Still the future. Brandes, who has chaired Florida’s transportation committee for four years, has managed to insert self-driving clauses in every transportation bill during his tenure. Every major city in the state must now include AVs in their long term planning, and a 14-mile major stretch of Tampa Bay highway near Brande’s home district is a federally designated testing lab for self driving cars. His efforts culminated in the enactment of HB 7027 this summer. Although Florida first permitted AV testing in 2014, the newest law stripped out language around testing and the need for a driver to be physically present, according to the state legislature (pdf, p 4). Instead, the bill allows anyone with a valid driver license to operate an autonomous vehicle as long as the AV can alert operators of a technology failure. If the operator “does not, or is not able to” take control, then the vehicle must “be capable of bringing [itself] to a complete stop.” In crafting the law, Brandes, said it was his intent to ensure the “operator” in this case does not have to be in the car (or even in the same state), monitoring the vehicle. He proposed a scenario where someone with a valid drivers license could open a smartphone app to summon a self-driving vehicle, and receive any alerts via the app. As long as the car could stop in the event of a problem, it would be legal. “It’s a possibility enabled by the law,” he said. The caveat is that any autonomous vehicle under Florida’s law must meet the the US DoT’s definition levels of “Level 3” autonomy. No bright line delineates Level 3 cars yet except that they “enable the driver to cede full control of all safety-critical functions under certain traffic or environmental conditions,” and the driver “is expected to be available for occasional control, but with sufficiently comfortable transition time.” It also defers to federal law if the statute conflicts with national policy. Vehicle automation levels: (NHTSA) Level 0: The human driver is in complete control of all functions of the car. • Level 1: One function is automated. • Level 2: More than one function is automated at the same time • Level 3: The driving functions are sufficiently automated that the driver can safely engage in other activities. • Level 4: The car can drive itself without a human driver. That leaves a lot of wiggle room. Car companies are just achieving Level 3 capabilities, although no cars are officially for sale yet. Audi plans to roll out Level 3 features in its A8 model by 2018, and has already tested self-driving prototypes in Florida (the state’s governor rode down a Tampa Bay expressway in one in 2014). Tesla, which says its Autopilot function only meets the semi-autonomous Level 2 threshold, could theoretically qualify as Level 3 under some driving conditions, say some in the auto industry. In a January call with reporters, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said he thinks cars will be “autonomous within 24 to 36 months,” adding, “I’d be very surprised if it were beyond that point.” Almost every major car company, and several technology companies, now plan to have AVs ready for the public before 2022. Google and Ford have both opted to jump straight to Level 4 to avoid the difficulties of the hand-off to humans in semi-autonomous vehicles. Google has said it plans to offer an automated vehicle by 2018, followed by Ford in 2021. That’s outpaced even proponents’ expectations. “This was brand new for everyone in 2012,” said Brandes. “That’s still much faster than anyone is prepared for in government.” Rather than take action, a few states have noted their existing motor vehicle codes do not expressly prohibit operation of self‑driving cars. “A lot of states haven’t even addressed AV,” said Michael Reynolds, a lawyer with O’Melveny & Myers in LA. “People look at that and say, ‘Well, if they don’t explicitly prohibit it then it’s not illegal,” Reynolds said. Those states, he argues, may even have more opportunities for deploying AV, although how to apply laws requiring a drivers licenses, seat belts, and hands on the steering wheel in vehicles without a human driver would be up to a judge.”It’s hard to say what would happen,” said Reynolds. “Considerable legal uncertainty” The US government has now cut through some of the chaos.The DoT’s more unified national framework includes a 15-point safety design standard for AVs, as well as a call for states to harmonize their policies. It also indicated the government was ready to recall any vehicles it found unsafe. For now, the DoT is taking it slow. “We left some areas intentionally vague because we wanted to outline the areas that need to be addressed and leave the rest to innovators,” Bryan Thomas, a spokesman for the Department of Transportation, told The New York Times on Sept 19. Ultimately, however, the federal government believes autonomous vehicles “will save time, money and lives.” Perhaps the most pressing question to answer is: Who is responsible if there’s a crash? “That’s something that’s been left up in the air with autonomous vehicles,” said Reynolds. It has proven to be perhaps the most worrying issue for automobile industry executives. In interviews with industry stakeholders in 2013, the RAND Corporation found liability outweighed almost any other concern. One manufacturer claimed that “we will never make a car that doesn’t have a driver,” according to RAND (pdf, p 152) Courts will likely be forced to decide the issue soon, say legal experts. States, so far, have been happy to leave liability up to the courts. “The question that comes up is: Who do you license?” said Brandes. “Do you license the driver? License the car? License the software? I’m in the camp that you license no one.” Instead, Brandes says, an autonomous vehicle is a product, and should be administered as one in the case of an accident. Brandes says he crafted Florida’s law so that courts could apportion liability under existing laws. That may actually work, says Bryant Walker Smith, a law professor at the University of South Carolina. Florida’s law does a “pretty good job” of laying the legislative tracks for future AV, wrote Smith by email. “The law does leave considerable legal uncertainty,” he wrote. “But this is inevitable, and limited deployments will soon provide a more concrete way to approach these issues.” A second approach would be to replace today’s “fault” system with a common insurance pool for all companies. That mirrors what Congress created to cover vaccines, aircraft, and nuclear energy in order to shield industry from litigation. A law could remove AV manufacturers’ liability for accidents to encourage investment and innovation, but compensate victims out a common fund, suggests RAND (pdf, p 131). The devil is in the details: Congress would need to find a way to defend against defective products, while avoiding litigation against the dozens of companies that have a hand manufacturing automated vehicles. If courts find they cannot fairly assign blame in accidents in which the drivers are a fusion of software and hardware, there may be little other choice. For now, governments are walking a line between public safety, and stifling a technology with huge potential benefits for society. Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

The firm has published a 30s teaser video and a uploaded new microsite https://madeby.google.com/ which feature the same message/animation. Earlier this month smartphone leaker and tipster Evan Blass asserted that Google was preparing a Huawei-built 7-inch 'Pixel' tablet for launch. Other headlining new hardware offerings may well be a pair of 'Pixel' branded phones made by HTC, a 4K Chromecast streamer, a Daydram View VR headset, and the Google Home household voice assistant (like an Amazon Echo). The above video simply and smartly hints at a number of devices. It begins with the basic, minimal Google Search box with blinking caret. The corners of the box round off while the shape transforms into a typical tablet, and then a typical smartphone outline. That's all we get, except for the video description claiming we will get "Something new to love on Oct. 4". On the dedicated 'madeby' microsite Google has created a similar animation but ends it with a slideshow constrained by the smartphone-shaped rounded rectangle. It might be too literal to extrapolate from this imagery to get to a fully bezel-less smartphone but that is what it appears to show. However, 'leaked' images suggest the new Pixel range will comprise of a pair of very standard looking rounded-rectangle smartphones, as below. The 4th October is exactly a fortnight from today.

Posted by Smudger - Tue 20 Sep 2016 11:49 I was thinking that I hope they'll be announcing the 4k chromecast as well, but I'm not sure I'll need it… Posted by Corky34 - Tue 20 Sep 2016 11:58 When i first read the title i though it was going to be privacy, that's a new thing for Google right? :D ;) Posted by cokker - Tue 20 Sep 2016 12:03 The last picture is two iPhones… Took the term “Think different” too literally. Congrats, the pixel phone now looks like a random Chinese iPhone knock off… Posted by Spud1 - Tue 20 Sep 2016 12:48 This is one of those situations where I hope the rumors are not true, but they probably are :( I like my Huawei P9; it's a great phone and was a bargain at £300..but I would really like to go back to a Nexus type phone at some point. The last 2 were pretty poor imo (5X/6P) with the former being under powered and very “last generation”, and the 6P being too big whilst also too expensive. I was really hoping we'd get back to a Nexus 4 or 5 level of quality and specs & style - even if we had to pay for it. Especially given the branding change to “pixel” which represents the top end chromebooks. Something special like a boarder less phone or something..but if we just get something like the leaked images then it's all very “meh”. My P9 is already a great iPhone clone (even down to the screws and amount of glue thats been used), don't need another! HTC have done a great job with the Desire 10 though (from a design standpoint - the phone itself is woefully underpowered) so I do hold out some hope that the leaks are just early prototypes and something special is really on the way… Posted by cheesemp - Tue 20 Sep 2016 13:18 Hoping these will be good. Loved my Nexus 5 - I'd still have it if I hadn't cracked the screen and then had issues with the replacement… Needs to be better than the 5X as that was disappointingly expensive for what it was. I just hope pixel doesn't equal expensive otherwise I'll have to stay away.

One, smartphones are almost always readily available and always with you. Second is because it’s a lot easier to share them directly off your phone than through a camera. The latest Google Photos update has made that even a lot easier, maybe even lazier. Now you can share with people more directly rather than wasting time trying to juggle sharing with apps. More often than not, sharing photos is a multi-step process. Pick your photo, tap on the share button, select the app to share with, and then select the person you want to share it with. That flow makes sense for a computer but not for the human brain, where it’s more natural to think of the person first and the app last. The new faster sharing feature in Google Photos adopts the more “natural” way of sharing. So instead of thinking of apps first, you think of people, and that’s pretty much it. The Photos app itself determines how to best send the message, in what form, and through what medium. If the recipient already has the Google Photos app installed, they’ll simply receive a notification to open the app. If the person happens to only have a phone number, they’ll get a link to the Google Photos web page via SMS. And those with e-mails get a convenient link to click or tap on. Sometimes, though, photos just aren’t enough to convey your message. A set of moving photos might be even better, but you might not have the time, or the creative juices, to get that going. Google Photos has got you covered too. Now it can automatically stitch up photos into a single video around “creative concepts”. While the app can already do so using recently taken photos, these revolve more around themed ideas or concepts, like photos showing a child’s journey from baby to little lady. Google promises that more concepts will be coming, including one for summer and one for weddings. The disadvantage is that you don’t really get to choose how the videos are made. But, hey, if you already knew how to make them, you might have already done it yourself anyway. These new features have already begun rolling out on Android, iOS, and even the Web.
