 The former head of Google's self-driving car project has secretly been working on his own startup Danielle Muoio Jan. 26, 2017, 7:49 PM 25,060 facebook linkedin twitter email print Chris Urmson in a Google self-driving car prototype. Medium / Chris Urmson Google suffered a major loss when Chris Urmson, the tech lead of its self-driving car project, left in August after more than seven years. But a Tesla lawsuit filed Thursday shows what Urmson has been up to since leaving the tech giant. Urmson has been quietly working with Sterling Anderson, the former director of Tesla Autopilot, on his own self-driving car company, Aurora Innovation. The lawsuit filed by Tesla in California state court alleges that Anderson stole "hundreds of gigabytes of data" that included sensitive company information for Aurora Innovation. The lawsuit identifies Urmson as a "business partner" of Anderson's at Aurora Innovation, and alleges that the pair collaborated on "Tesla premises" using Anderson's Tesla-issued laptop.  "Tesla's meritless lawsuit reveals both a startling paranoia and an unhealthy fear of competition. This abuse of the legal system is a malicious attempt to stifle a competitor and destroy personal reputations. Aurora looks forward to disproving these false allegations in court and to building a successful self-driving business," Aurora wrote in a statement to Business Insider. The lawsuit lists Anderson, Urmson, and Aurora Innovation as defendants in the case that seeks a jury trial to resolve the matter. Now that Tesla has filed a lawsuit, Google's self-driving company Waymo will explore whether or not to take action itself, a source familiar with the matter told Business Insider. Chris Urmson did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment. Google's exec departures Urmson left Google's self-driving company during a string of departures in August 2016. Anthony Levandowski, a co-founder of Google's car project, left to start Otto, a self-driving truck company that was bought by Uber. Jiajun Zhu, another co-founder of Google's self-driving car unit, also left to join Nuro, an artificial intelligence startup. There were reports of internal struggles within Google at the time as well. Google seemed to be getting overtaken by the competition as Uber launched public self-driving car trials. Some employees wanted to pursue partial autonomy to get a product to market faster, while Alphabet CEO Larry Page insisted on full autonomy, Bloomberg reported in September. Urmson told Bloomberg he wasn't frustrated with progress, but declined to elaborate on his departure. Google has since pivoted its strategy to get a product to market sooner. In December, it spun out the car group into an independent company under Alphabet called Waymo. Waymo has acquiesced on some of its bolder plans, like cars without steering wheels. Urmson, for his part, was known to advocate for fully self-driving cars before leaving Google. He lobbied the Senate on Google's behalf for regulations that would allow fully self-driving cars to drive on public roads without steering wheels or pedals. We can't be sure Urmson's departure from Google was because the company was gearing up to pursue a different strategy than its steering-wheel-less pod cars. But whatever Aurora Innovation plans to release going forward may provide some insight as to why Urmson stepped down as CTO. Google declined to comment for this article. "Now, 1.8 million miles of autonomous driving later, I’ve decided the time is right to step down and find my next adventure," Urmson wrote in a Medium post about his departure in August. "If I can find another project that turns into an obsession and becomes something more, I will consider myself twice lucky."

She previously was a reporter for the Wall Street Journal. Follow @ShiraOvide Facebook Twitter Email Print Share Jan 27, 2017 1:02 PM EST ALPHABET INC-CL A -11.95 At Closing, Jan 27th 845.03 USD It’s hard to quibble with the continued success of Google's advertising business. Already the dominant company in the $200 billion annual market for web and mobile commercials, Google parent company Alphabet Inc. padded its advertising revenue by about $12 billion from 2015 to 2016. That means in a single year, Google found new business that was equivalent to half of Facebook's total yearly sales.  But there is a potentially dark cloud in Google's sunny skies. Google’s advertising empire has two parts. About 70 percent of Alphabet’s total revenue last year came from the ads that the company sells on its own digital properties, including Google web search pages, YouTube, Gmail, Google Maps and more.  The rest of Google’s advertising revenue comes from the company’s role as a middleman for ads all over the web and mobile devices. For example, the company might help Nike find people who are likely to buy its shoes, based on Google's stockpile of information on what people browse and do online. Then Google can pitch them ads for Nike in many spots they roam on the web. Google also has technology that helps owners of websites auction off ad spots. Staying Home Google parent company Alphabet is increasingly dependent on advertisements it sells on its own properties, including web search and YouTube Source: Alphabet filings What Google calls its “network” business is lagging behind the incredible growth of Google’s ad sales on its own digital hangouts. Revenue from the ad network rose 4 percent in 2016, while ad sales on Google's websites and apps rose 22 percent. The slower growth of Google's ad network means it is accounting for a smaller and smaller share of the company's total sales. In the fourth quarter of 2016, Google's advertising network generated 17 percent of Alphabet's total revenue, down from 22 percent three years earlier. The reasons for this are complicated. Digital advertising is changing. More ad sales are entirely computerized, pushing down the average prices for each ad and pinching Google's growth in its advertising network. The digital advertising business is growing more concentrated; a larger share of industry revenue is coming from ads sold on the websites and apps controlled by two companies, Google and Facebook Inc. Smaller advertising players and ad networks are losing ground.  Right now, the soft spot in Google’s advertising network sales is no big deal. It's good, actually. Google is more than making up the difference with prodigious growth in ad sales on its own websites, which generally have higher prices and are more profitable for Google than the ads for which the company acts as a middleman.  Opposite Directions Google is getting better at luring people to click on ads it shows on its own websites and apps. It is less successful in boosting the number of times people click on ads Google serves elsewhere online. Source: Alphabet filings But allow me to wallow a bit in Google's worst-case scenario: It could turn into Yahoo Inc. This is every internet company’s worst fear. Yahoo in its heyday had the most popular hangouts on the web, including its homepage. And it had at the time the leading technology for serving up banner ads to the millions of people who used Yahoo as the front door to the internet. Then, Yahoo's internet stardom faded. And its technology didn't keep pace with changes in online advertising. The combination of failures meant dependence on ad sales from its own websites proved painful as those internet visitors moved to other sites and to their smartphones. That's not to say Google will follow Yahoo's path to internet ignominy. Google is the best internet ad machine ever created, with the best technology to harness untold reams of information about people's habits to feed into it.  But the relatively slow growth of Google's advertising machine away from its own digital walls do leave the company potentially vulnerable. If search, YouTube, Google Maps and other company properties fade in popularity, then Google will have fewer digital billboard spots to apply its advertising prowess. Technology changes quickly and can turn today's internet stars into tomorrow's internet losers. Google's advertising strength in its web homes could someday become its dystopian nightmare.

Credit: Blair Hanley Frank More like this Cisco says it'll make IoT safe because it owns the network 10 reasons Apple is winning the enterprise Cisco's all-in-one Spark Board puts the cloud on a wall Video Review: Huawei's Mate 9 gives good value for the price Cisco Systems tried to give Android devices the same kinds of integration it later provided for iPhones and iPads, but gave up because the Android ecosystem was too fragmented. A Cisco-Apple partnership announced in 2015 gives iOS devices capabilities that other wireless clients don’t have on Cisco-based enterprise networks. Among other things, enterprises can designate work-related applications like videoconferencing for priority on the wireless link between iOS devices and a Wi-Fi access point. The partnership will also make it a little easier for Apple fans to work with the Spark Board all-in-one meeting device that Cisco announced on Tuesday. Android doesn’t have those advantages. It’s not that Android devices don’t work with Cisco networks or the Spark Board: Most Spark Board interactions are possible on Android through things like public APIs. But things might have gone a different way. “We started with Android,” said Rowan Trollope, Cisco’s senior vice president of IoT and applications, in a press briefing after Tuesday’s launch. When Trollope and Cisco collaboration guru Jonathan Rosenberg went to Google to propose ways to help Android devices work better on Cisco networks, the company was enthusiastic, he said. But because so many players, including carriers and phone manufacturers, can craft their own variations on Android, Google couldn’t hash out integrations with Cisco on its own, Trollope said. “We like your ideas,” he recalled Google saying. “Go talk to Samsung and HTC and, oh yes, you have to go to Verizon, too.” Some Android users decry the modifications that device companies and carriers make to Google’s open-source OS, which they say can hobble important features. In addition, vendors and service providers usually upgrade users' phones to the next release of Android only after long delays, or don’t offer upgrades at all. Apple fully controls iOS and offers new releases to all users at the same time, though older devices can’t necessarily run the latest version. Cisco did approach Samsung, the biggest manufacturer of Android products, but that still left a lot more vendors to deal with. “One by one by one,” Trollope said. “We don’t have the resources to do that.” Mobile operators might not even want to give their versions of Android all the capabilities that Apple developed with Cisco, he added. For example, the Cisco-Apple integration helps enterprises shift voice calls from the carrier network to a wireless LAN without losing things like call logging for compliance. “It’s not necessarily in the operator’s best interest,” Trollope said. “Apple can do it, and Apple did do it.” Google did not respond to a request for comment. A Samsung representative declined to comment. To express your thoughts on Computerworld content, visit Computerworld's Facebook page, LinkedIn page and Twitter stream.

An update today expands the service to Austria and Switzerland, while adding a new navigation drawer and notification sound. Launched in 2013 by the Google Surveys team, the app allows people to answer quick surveys and earn Play Store credit. Some surveys are based on location history and recently visited places, while others are more general and ask which choice you prefer. In the early days, surveys were pushed to users on a near weekly basis, with reward amounts ranging from a few cents to $1 in the United States. Despite the drop in frequency, the app is still being developed and expanding to more countries, like Austria and Switzerland. Today’s version also adds a hamburger menu to accommodate a new settings page, with the navigation drawer featuring Home, Reward History, and Help. In Settings, there is a new option to enable Notification sounds, though users don’t have the ability to customize the tone. Additionally, there is a link to Google Location History that opens up Play Services. The latest version is now widely available via the Play Store.

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   Google cozies up to Republicans in bid to shed left-loving image: report By Ethan Baron / January 27, 2017 at 2:55 PM Google has a donkey on its back, and it’s trying to shake it off and take a nice elephant ride instead. That’s the metaphorical version of a new report that shows the firm, with parent firm Alphabet, aggressively courting Republicans while trying to shed what’s perceived as a strong allegiance to the Democrats. “Few companies have been as intimately tied to the Democratic Party in recent years as Google,” an article in the Jan. 27 New York Times began. “So now that Donald J. Trump is president, the giant company, in Silicon Valley parlance, is having to pivot.” As pointed out by the Oracle-funded Google Transparency Project, the Mountain View tech behemoth had a revolving door with the Barack Obama White House, with Googlers leaving to take up government roles and government staff leaving to work for Google. The firm had many, many meetings with high officials in the Obama administration, according to records collected by the Google Transparency Project. Alphabet executive chairman Eric Schmidt advised the Obama White House and worked with the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign. Last year, Google employees gave $1.3 million to the Clinton campaign, compared with $26,000 to Trump’s, the Times reported. “Now, the tech giant is scrambling to forge ties with Mr. Trump’s new administration and to strengthen its relationship with a Republican-dominated Congress,” the Times reported. “Most important, Google is trying to change the perception that it is a Democratic stronghold.” In the campaign to get cozier with the party of the elephant, Google helped throw a fete this month for 70 mostly Republican federal lawmakers in a “stately” Smithsonian building in Washington, D.C., according to the Times. “The party was primarily financed and anchored by Google,” the Times reported. Alex Skatell, founder of a news startup described by the paper as having a “right-leaning millennial audience,” also helped host the bash, according to the Times. “We’ve partnered with Google on events before, but nothing like this party,” Skatell said. “I’ve never heard of an event as big.” The Smithsonian told the paper the party cost at least $50,000.

Google established Google Trust Services, LLC as its root certificate authority in order "to enable reliable and secure identity authentication, and to facilitate the preservation of confidentiality and integrity of data in electronic transactions." According to Ryan Hurst, security and privacy engineering at Google, the main reason for this move was to make deploying root certificates faster. "For this reason we have also purchased two existing Root Certificate Authorities, GlobalSign R2 and R4. These Root Certificates will enable us to begin independent certificate issuance sooner rather than later," Hurst wrote in a blog post. "We intend to continue the operation of our existing GIAG2 subordinate Certificate Authority. This change will enable us to begin the process of migrating to our new, independent infrastructure." Google has long been a proponent of accountability when it comes to root certificate authorities (CA) with its Certificate Transparency service to log all certificates. However, Google has left questions when it comes to running its own root CA. For example, the blog post makes it sound as though Google's Root CA will primarily be issuing certificates for other Google and Alphabet products, but Hurst explained a bigger aim in a post to Bugzilla@Mozilla to secure inclusion of Google-issued certificates in the Firefox browser. "Google Trust Services is run by Google. Google is a commercial CA that will provide certificates to customers from around the world. We will offer certificates for server authentication, client authentication, email (both signing and encrypting), and code signing," Hurst wrote. "Customers of the Google [public key infrastructure] are the general public. We will not require that customers have a domain registration with Google, use domain suffixes where Google is the registrant, or have other services from Google." Paul Vixie, CEO of Farsight Security Inc. in San Mateo, Calif., and architect of domain name system (DNS) protocol extensions and applications, said this could be another point of control for Google. "Google builds their own networking equipment and owns their own dark fiber. It makes business sense to control your own supply chain when you can afford it, especially if an external dependency puts you at risk," Vixie told SearchSecurity. "But I suspect they are going to mint many orders of magnitude of certs in the future than they've done so far, and that their intermediate CA status put them at volume-based pricing or discount risk." Kevin Bocek, vice president of of security strategy and threat intelligence at Venafi, agreed with this sentiment. "By becoming a root certificate authority, Google is eliminating dependencies on others and is in total control," Bocek told SearchSecurity, warning that, "Maintaining agility to move between CAs and remain in control is a critical requirement. Automating the secure lifecycle of keys and certificates to retain this control has to be at the top of the priority list for CISOs and their teams." Both Bocek and Vixie said Google would need to put in place policies to ensure any certificates issued by Google for Google products being included in the Chrome browser follow CA/Browser Forum's Baseline Requirements. Bocek said Google certificates would need to be audited by a third party. "As we've seen with Symantec, GlobalSign, GoDaddy and many more, CAs can make errors, are victims of fraud, and can be hacked. Google will be no different, and will need to make sure they are transparent and audited by a third party," Bocek said. "This serves as a reminder to businesses that certificates are probably the most important element of cybersecurity, but often overlooked." Vixie said Google could outsource audits to another firm, but could potentially get by simply with a certain level of transparency. "They might decide that for pki.goog, they will make all of their auditing information public, and then hire a big-four firm to certify that it's what they really do," Vixie said. "They can afford to do this and be best-of-breed as a CA and put competitive pressure on other CA's. Since their success depends on the rest of the internet being as secure as possible, this qualifies as the kind of investment that improves their general business conditions."

Google’s Sundar Pichai says it’s ‘very early days’ in the battle against Amazon Echo Posted yesterday by Brian Heater (@bheater) 0 SHARES Next Story The League brings its picky dating app to Android Between the Pixel and Google Home, 2016 was a big year for Google voice search, but the company’s plays in the space still seemed to pale in comparison to Amazon’s infiltration, courtesy of its wildly successful Echo devices. In today’s Q4 Alphabet earnings call, Google Inc. CEO Sundar Pichai addressed what looks to be a late start from the company, calling the voice search space, “very early days,” adding, “We expect voice to work from many different contexts. We are thinking about it across phones, homes, TVs, cars and trying to drive the ecosystem that way, and we want it to be there for users when they need it.” Without giving specific numbers, the exec cited Home’s brisk sales, calling Q4 “very strong” for the product. Pichai added that the company plans to invest “a lot” in the category, coupled with a long-term commitment to voice that predates the connected home device by some time. “When I look at what it would take to do voice search well, our years of research into natural language voice processing comes into play,” he said. “I think there’s a lot of work ahead to make this work well for users. This is a core area we’ve invested in for the long term, so this is an area I feel comfortable about how it will play out in the future.” Pichai’s not wrong, of course. The real war for the connected home has really only started playing out, but it’s hard to ignore Amazon’s healthy head start, both in terms of home infiltration and third-party partners. Google has certainly been aggressive on both fronts, with a number of announcements around Home and Assistant in recent months. That, coupled with widespread Android device deployment and years of search and voice investment, could ultimately end up paying off for the company in the long run.

On Wednesday, Google published a report that they had permanently banned 200 publishers from their AdSense network for misrepresenting content to readers and posing as news organizations. For many of these websites, Google’s ad service was one of the sources that helped them generate lucrative revenues. According to the report, Google’s actions against fake news websites was an implementation of the AdSense misrepresentative content policy that the company had passed last November. The move by Google to curtail the revenues of fake news sites was greeted by a degree of skepticism from other media sites. The New York Times points out that Google’s ban of 200 publishers might not seem that grand a move when you consider nearly 2 million publishers use Google’s AdSense. And according to Variety, Google has other problems that it still has to grapple with, including a search algorithm that has in the past highlighted fake news, the most famous example being the misrepresentation of the outcome of the popular vote in 2016’s presidential election, which appeared in Google’s top search results last November. To fight bad ads, sites and scammers, we took down 1.7 billion ads that violated our advertising policies in 2016: https://t.co/D2GAkZlXuG pic.twitter.com/70AR5ZTO0k — Google (@Google) January 25, 2017 One of the problems Google faces in its attempts to curb the spread of fake news is proving that the news on those websites are demonstrably fake. Most of these websites, the New York Times argues, rely on selective quoting that can be misleading to a reader but which are harder to disprove outright. Facebook has tried to tackle this similar issue in the past by working with third-party fact-checking organizations to help them identify and flag down disputable news sources. Last December, Facebook announced that news that had been identified as fakes by organizations such as ABC News, AP, and the Washington Post Fact Checker would be flagged as “disputed” and would appear lower on people’s news feed. Facebook has now ramped up its efforts to combat fake news. On January 25, the same day that Google published its report on its actions against misleading and inappropriate ads and websites, Facebook announced that it had made improvements to the “Trending” feature on their platform. The new trending topics on Facebook will now have a publisher name featured under the headline. Another change that has occurred is that users of the same region will now see the same trending topics, instead of personalized topics curated based on their interests. One of the most important changes, however, may be the improvements Facebook has made to the system that helps it determine what topics are trending. According to Facebook, a topic will now be regarded as trending based on the number of publishers reporting on the same topic and the engagement surrounding those articles, whereas in the past, a topic would be identified as trending if a single article covering the topic received a high engagement rate on Facebook. Facebook’s webpage as shown on its PC and mobile format. [Image by Carl Court/Getty Images] Like Google, Facebook has its critics. In a statement to the Huffington Post, MediaMatters President Angelo Carusone was unenthusiastic about Facebook’s moves to reduce the presence of fake news on its social media platform. “Today’s announced policy changes are at best a marginal improvement. While moving in the right direction, these half-measures will not stop the rampant lies spreading on the platform.” Interestingly, despite the fact that the issue of fake news has preoccupied much of the discussion surrounding media and journalism these days, a recent article by Vox has pointed out that the effect of fake news may not be as determinative as we think, especially in the case of the role fake news played in the outcome of the U.S. presidential election. Matthew Gentzkow, a professor of economics at Stanford University, has pointed out in his interview with Vox that fake news is actually not what concerns him the most and that the attention that is being paid to fake news may be disproportionate. “I think fake news is not the main thing we should be worried about. I think the broader issue of people curating what they see or what people see being curated for them is the far bigger concern…Fake news is the tip of the iceberg of a much bigger set of highly partisan stories that people were exposed to during the election.” [Featured Image by Ethan Miller/Getty Images] Now Watch This: Nintendo Switch Takes Aim At A New Generation Now Read This: Apple Watch: New Updates Excite Owners Share 2 Tweet 0 Share 0 Share 0 Pin It 0 Author Pang Chieh Ho Tags: Facebook, fake news, google, social media January 27, 2017 Seunghee Performing ‘Ugly’ By 2NE1 Goes Viral, Fans Debate Why K-Pop Idol Of OH!MYGIRL Broke Down During Performance [Video] January 27, 2017 ‘Saimdang, Light’s Diary’ K-Drama Debuts With Double-Digit Viewership — SBS Continues To Dominate Korean TV With Past/Present Timelines And Dual Role Concepts [Video And Spoilers] View full timeline 12 hours ago Facebook And Google Join Fight Against Fake News Sites 1 day ago Steve Bannon Interview: Trump Strategist Tells Media ‘Opposition Party’ To ‘Keep Its Mouth Shut’ Comments LATEST HEADLINES Tom Price, Trump’s Pick To Head HHS, Is A Recent Member Of Group That Supports Vaccine Choice Kim Kardashian Reportedly Bans Kanye West From ‘KUWTK’ Costa Rica Holiday Amid Divorce Rumors Gigi Hadid: How She’s Coping With Selena Gomez, The Weeknd Romance — Bella Still Hurt?

Applications by Vanessa Hand Orellana January 25, 2017 5:24 PM PST @vanehand Up Next Meet Jon Hamm, the hologram (aka the holohamm) Order an Uber on Google Maps The Google Maps app now includes a ride-sharing option that lets you compare prices and wait times between Uber and Lyft and order one without leaving the app. by Vanessa Hand Orellana 1:39 Close Drag Figuring out the fastest way to get to your destination just got a lot easier. Google Maps has added car hailing to its list of transportation method options, which means you can order an Uber without leaving the app. Next time you have somewhere to go, don't bother opening the Uber app. As long as your apps are up-to-date and you're logged in to your Uber account, you should have the new ride-hailing option as soon as you open the Google Maps app. How to order an Uber with Google Maps Search for, or type in, your destination and map it out as usual. Once you see your route, swipe right on the transportation options on the top of the screen until you come across the stick figure holding a briefcase and select. This will prompt a pop-up screen on the bottom showing price estimates and wait times for both Uber and Lyft. And though both show up as results, for now only Uber lets you complete the transaction without leaving the Maps app. Click on the Uber tab at the top. The interface is not exactly what you're used to seeing in the Uber app, but you still have the same basic options for comparing prices and wait times. Next, select your ride type (Pool, UberX, Uber XL, Select, Black or SUV) and click request. This will prompt you to select a payment method. It defaults to the card on file for your Uber account, but you can easily add a different one or even use Android Pay if you have it set up on your phone. If you've already linked Uber to your Google account, you should see the tiny car icon making its way to you as soon as you hit the "Book it" button on the bottom right. If not, you'll see a pop-up screen prompting you to do so before you book. Once your driver is en route you can contact him or her directly from Google Maps or cancel your ride. You'll still be notified when the car arrives, and the actual ride is exactly the same. The only thing you may still have to use the Uber app for is to rate your driver after the ride. And if you need more incentive to book via Google Maps, Uber is currently offering a $15 credit toward your first ride using Maps for both Android and iOS users. In the UK, the credit is £20 Share your voice 0 comments Tags Applications Mobile Apps Google Maps Google Uber 8 Design 7 Features 6 Performance CNET Review Google Maps for Mobile Despite some limitations, Google Maps for Mobile is a simple and handy app that brings interactive maps, driving directions, and traffic info to your mobile device.

According to 9to5Google’s sources, the Pixel 2 will come with improved hardware and waterproofing, while the company is also said to be releasing a budget handset alongside its flagship device. As with the current Pixels, the Pixel 2 will reportedly sport one of the best cameras you’ll find in a high-end smartphone. Sources say that Google wants it to have excellent low-light photography capabilities, and while the MP size won’t be large, the phone will “compensate in extra features,” which could include more shooting modes. Many upcoming handsets are said to be waterproof or water-resistant, and it seems that the next Pixel will follow this trend. While the feature’s inclusion is said to have moved from “definitely” to “on the table,” it would be big surprise if Google didn’t make the Pixel 2 shower-friendly, much like Samsung’s Galaxy S7 series. The handsets’ chipset is still an unknown element. In all likelihood, the Pixel 2 will feature the latest Snapdragon processor, possibly the 835, but sources claims that some prototype models are being tested that use Intel chips. These upgrades don’t come cheap; the new phones are expected to be “at least” $50 more expensive than the current Pixels. But fans on a budget may have another option: a third device could be released alongside or just after the Pixel 2 and Pixel XL 2 that has a much lower price-point. This “significantly cheaper” phone, referred to as the Pixel 2B, will have less powerful hardware and fewer features than its more expensive counterparts, and be primarily aimed at emerging markets. We’re unlikely to see the next Pixels until the fourth quarter of this year, so expect plenty of new rumors before then. Really, though, Google should just make sure that the Pixel 2 is problem-free, unlike many of the current Pixel handsets.

Currently rolling out, the update will be available globally for Android devices, and the Parking Difficulty feature will work in 25 metro areas in the United States.  The current list of supported cities includes San Francisco, Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, New York City,  Philadelphia, St. Louis, the DC area, Cleveland, Dallas/Fort Worth, Denver, Houston, Phoenix, and a few others. While it won't work for all of the areas Google Maps covers, most of the major US cities where parking is an issue are covered. The small parking information icon originally appeared in the beta version of Maps earlier this month, but now it is being officially released. Google uses similar technology as its Popular times and visit duration feature to calculate the anticipated parking situation at your destination. They certainly won't have actual workers monitoring parking lots to get an exact count, so the information is just an estimate. In the Google Maps app, you'll see a small rating on what Google thinks parking will be like. It ranges from easy, to medium, to difficult and will use historical parking data from your intended destination. The service can help you decide if you need to leave a bit sooner to allow for parking, but it could also be a sign of more to come. This small new feature could be a stepping stone for future ride sharing or autonomous driving projects that Google has planned.

Read more about the stories in today's news: HPI Has Samsung-like Problem: Overheating Batteries iPhone Production Volume Slid 11.5 Percent in 2016 Google Says It Blocked 1.7 Billion Ads for Policy Violations in 2016 Sophos Phish Threat Aims to Educate Users on Phishing Risks       Today's topics include HPI's recall of more than 100,000 notebook PCs with batteries that could overheat, how much Apple iPhone production slowed in 2016, Google's report on why it blocked 1.7 billion online ads in 2016 and Sophos’ new Phish Threat attack simulator to help educate users on phishing risks. Samsung isn't the only major IT device maker that's been having trouble with too-hot-to-handle batteries. Hewlett-Packard Inc., has determined that the lithium-ion batteries used in many of its notebook PCs are fire hazards. On Jan. 24, HPI recalled about 101,000 notebooks so it could replace the suspect batteries. The company said that the batteries can overheat, posing fire and burn hazards. It is requiring owners to replace them immediately. "Consumers should immediately stop using the recalled batteries, remove them from the notebook computers and contact HP for a free replacement battery," HPI said in a media advisory. "Until a replacement battery is received, consumers should use the notebook computer by plugging it into AC power only." Research firm TrendForce reported Jan. 25 that global smartphone production volume for 2016 grew 4.7 percent annually to reach 1.36 billion units. Apple iPhone production fell by 11.5 percent. Samsung, with 23 percent market share, continued to top the annual global ranking despite the discontinuation of Galaxy Note7 smartphone because of defective batteries. Samsung mobile device production declined 3.3 percent compared to its 2015 total, mainly because Galaxy Note7 phones were recalled after batteries in a significant number of units overheated, burned or even exploded. Apple is No. 2 with a 15.3 percent share. Chinese brands Huawei, OPPO and Vivo, respectively, occupied the last three spots in the global market share top five. Google makes billions of dollars from web advertising. But the company has long claimed it does not hesitate to take down ads that it considers misleading, harmful or inappropriate. New figures and data released by the company provided more detail. In 2016, Google blocked 1.7 billion ads for violating the company’s policies. That represented double the number of ads Google blocked the previous year. About 68 million of the ads that Google blocked last year were related to bogus or illegal health care products—up sharply from the 12.5 million ads that were dropped in 2015.  Another 80 million were taken down for misleading users with false information in order to drive more clicks. Security vendor Sophos announced the official launch of its Phish Threat attack simulator on Jan. 25 to help improve end-user and organizational readiness for phishing attacks. Sophos didn't build the Phish Threat technology on its own, rather the platform was acquired from privately-held security consultancy Silent Break Security in November 2016. Phish Threat enables organizations to simulate phishing attacks to test user responses. Brady Bloxham, creator of Phish Threat, told eWEEK that while there are other phishing test platforms on the market, but in his view, they don't always reflect the evolving threat landscape. Now as part of Sophos, Phish Threat benefits from the Sophos Central platform, which is an effort to provide a consolidated view of security devices and controls across an organization.       Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows Google Open Sources Data Visualization Tool for Machine Learning Cisco Security Business Group Continues to Accelerate Growth Amazon Go Won't Kill Many Jobs, But It May Prove a Boon to Crooks Microsoft, Harman Kardon to Take on Amazon Echo, Google Home Yahoo Suffers New Hack; 1 Billion Users Impacted This Time 10 Things T-Mobile Has Done to Move O...

HTC’s head VR designer joins Google as industrial design director Posted yesterday by Lucas Matney (@lucas_matney) 0 SHARES Next Story Myst arrives on Android, Riven to follow soon HTC’s VP of design responsible for the HTC Vive virtual reality headset and many of the company’s handsets is leaving the company to join Google and work with the company’s Daydream platform. @vladsavov I am joining Google Daydream, so you can redirect your criticism:). — Claude Zellweger (@Claudibus) January 26, 2017 Claude Zellweger announced the departure in a tweet late Wednesday night. The designer had joined HTC in 2008 after his design agency, One & Co, was acquired by the Taiwanese tech giant. Zellweger went on to become the VP of Design at HTC in 2014 where he’s dedicated himself to efforts in defining the brand strategy and execution of Vive. A Google spokesperson has confirmed to TechCrunch that Zellweger will be joining Google as a director of industrial design where he will work with the Daydream team. HTC also confirmed the executive’s departure in a statement: “HTC can confirm that Claude Zellweger has left the Company. We appreciate his considerable contribution to HTC, and wish him well in his future endeavors. HTC continues to invest in talent and recruitment as part of our broader strategy to ensure the continued strength and integrity of the Company’s organizational structure.” No word on exactly what Zellweger’s role will entail at Google Daydream. The mobile VR platform has largely been focused on the platform side while hardware like the company’s Daydream View has served as a design reference for other companies. His work on the Vive headset at HTC should be especially useful if Google decides to venture into the world of all-in-one VR headsets as has been frequently rumored. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Google Founded 1998 Overview Google is a multinational corporation that is specialized in internet-related services and products.

Alphabet’s bets beyond search are starting to pay off Posted yesterday by Matthew Lynley (@mattlynley) 0 SHARES Next Story Existing Nvidia Shield TV owners can now update to get 4K HDR streaming Google reported mixed earnings for its fourth quarter today — but we’re starting to see some flashes of improvement in its “other bets” category, which is where it stuffs pretty much everything that lives outside of Google proper. In the fourth quarter, Alphabet’s other bets recorded $262 million in revenue, a healthy jump from $150 million in the fourth quarter a year ago. But more importantly, the company’s losses in the division shrank from the previous year, from $1.2 billion in Q4 2015 to around $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter this year. Google’s other bets consists of products like Nest, and while this represents a tiny fraction of Google’s overall business, it’s important because it represents a lot of the market Google envisions itself occupying in the years to come — and it’s equally important to see strong performance in that category. CFO Ruth Porat dove into further into the other bets category for the full year, where other bets generated $809 million in 2016, up 82% vs 2015 — which was primarily generated by Nest, Fiber and Verily. The operating loss for the division was $2.9B for the first year 2016, a slight decline from 2015 (Porat didn’t specify there). So even if it’s a slight decline, it looks like things aren’t getting quite out of hand and losses are accelerating as Alphabet enters 2017. Alphabet will “continue to calibrate the magnitude and pace” of its investments in other bets, and “exercise careful stewardship over the amounts and pace of investments,” Porat said. Alphabet’s other bets in 2016 in particular faced scrutiny. The company sought to trim down a lot of the underperforming segments of Alphabet in order and focus its resources on the operations that were working. Alphabet has for a long time (with Google X) been known as a bit of a playground for new ideas — like balloons and fiber internet — but the company is showing signs that it needs to push forward into areas that it knows best and where it can dominate. That’s included making some aggressive moves like spinning out its self-driving car unit into a new company called Waymo, among others. If you wanted some perspective on how tiny this component is, here you go (but remember this is a significant area of importance for the company): FindTheCompany | Graphiq We’ve also seen Google expand into newer areas like trying to expand its Google Cloud, with moves like the hiring of Diane Green. It became clear that this could be a hugely lucrative business in 2016 by just looking at the performance of Amazon’s AWS business over the past year. That business has quickly become one of Amazon’s most efficient operations and contributing segments to its profitability, something which has surely not gone unnoticed with Google. Microsoft is also working to aggressively snap up as much of this space as it can, so there is plenty of competition. Here’s a point of performance for Google’s areas that include Play, Cloud and Hardware: Google’s “other revenues” which encompass that was up 62% to $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter, up from $2.1 billion in the same quarter a year earlier. There weren’t specific break-outs for those individual divisions, but it looks like either all are growing in a healthy clip or at there is some outsized performance in one or more. Analysts were looking for earnings of $9.67 per share on $25.22 billion in revenue. The company reported earnings of $9.36 per share on revenue of $26.06 billion. Given the mixed results, the stock was largely unchanged, but we’re starting to see some interesting developments for Google beyond search. Alphabet’s shares in extended trading fell around 2.5% — which, for a massive company for Google, is quite a bit — meaning there may be some uncertainty among Wall Street that Google is steering in the right direction as that ad value continues to fall. That it didn’t generate the earnings that Wall Street was expecting probably represents some concern that it’ll continue to be a cash machine while it figures out what happens throughout the next few years. Last year was essentially a transition year for Alphabet, which over the course of 2016 showed flashes of its transition beyond simply a search engine advertising business. While search has always been Google’s core competency — and decades of that have helped it build a powerful AI ecosystem — it’s not like it can continue monetizing with desktop search ads forever. The biggest result of this major shift away from desktop search is Google’s perpetually declining advertising value. The play for mobile has largely been to either figure out new advertising formats, or figure out how to generate more value from the much larger amount of impressions mobile devices generate. As a result, Google is able to offset its declining value per ad (the cost-per-click) with more impressions and still generate impressive results that keep Wall Street happy for now. Not surprisingly, we’re still seeing that in decline. Google’s cost-per-click once again fell, this time down 15% in the fourth quarter from the same quarter a year earlier. Its paid clicks, as expected, continued to rise and were up 36% in the fourth quarter from the same quarter a year earlier. So, on the advertising front, more or less the same story as the past previous quarters.

Google launched Google Assistant in the hopes that people would simply talk to their phones (and eventually find a way to monetize that). And then it quickly followed Amazon into created a living room-based speaker that its users can talk to for simple tasks like queries and streaming music. All of this helps Google get its users more accustomed to “asking” Google for answers and actions in a more conversational way, where it finds itself quickly diving into a massive competition with Amazon and Apple’s Siri. Conversational user interfaces seem like they may have snuck up on us, but it over time became very clear to Google that it couldn’t just be a box where users could type in keywords with results that it could advertise against.   Google’s pitch to Wall Street over the past year or so seems to have been good enough. So far, its advertising business is good enough — and continuing to grow as mobile devices continue to proliferate — while it figures out what comes next with its voice-enabled interface and also future platforms like VR. FindTheCompany | Graphiq Alphabet, for its part, has a huge window in 2017 to reclaim its crown as the most valuable company in the world — something it’s held for a brief moment over Apple. Apple’s growth strategy came to a halt in 2016. While it’s signaled it’ll return to growth on the strength of the iPhone 7 and other products in the first quarter this year, it’s opened a massive hole for a company to come in and scoop up potential new users in new avenues — like a voice-based UI — that Apple hasn’t captured just yet.

More than 3M businesses now pay for Google’s G Suite Posted yesterday by Frederic Lardinois (@fredericl) 0 SHARES Next Story With New Zealand citizenship, Peter Thiel can watch the world burn in peace During today’s earnings call, Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced a new milestone for the adoption of Google’s G Suite productivity tools. “G Suite achieved a significant new customer milestone last quarter,” he said. “More than 3 million paying businesses are now using G Suite to collaborate smartly and securely in the cloud.” The last time Google announced a similar milestone was in November 2015. At that time, what was then called Google Apps for Work was being used by 2 million paying businesses. Pichai attributed G Suite’s success — especially with enterprise customers — to Google’s ability to provide its users with a highly secure platform. He also noted that Google continues to focus on expanding the partner ecosystem around G Suite (as well as the Google Cloud Platform). “Our customers and partners are appreciating Google Cloud’s dramatically accelerated pace of product rollout as well as our responsiveness to both their needs and aspirations,” he added. It’s no secret that Google is currently heavily focused on getting more enterprises to adopt its tools and services. This includes both its G Suite productivity tools as well as its cloud computing platform. At its Horizon event last September, the company combined all of its cloud infrastructure and productivity tools under the Google Cloud moniker. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Google Founded 1998 Overview Google is a multinational corporation that is specialized in internet-related services and products.

But if Google can’t get its voice-enabled tools like Assistant into the hands of consumers, then people won’t be using Google’s voice search. That was the concern of one analyst participating in Google parent company Alphabet’s fourth-quarter earnings call Thursday, asking about the company’s efforts to get its voice-based devices — such as its relatively new Google Home speaker — out in the marketplace. On the call, RBC Capital analyst Mark Mahaney noted that while hardware may not be a big part of Google’s business today, it could be down the line — and if Google can’t get enough traction later on, that could become a challenge. “It looks to me like Google devices are being outsold by ten to one, or something like that, in a lot of homes,” Mahaney said. (And beyond Amazon’s rival Echo speaker, we’d note that Apple’s Siri has been built into iPhones for half a decade.) Google CEO Sundar Pichai’s response, in essence: The voice-search competition is just beginning, and Google shouldn’t be counted out. “We are really excited” about voice search, he said. “I think it’s a very natural way for users to interact.” Google’s strategy, Pichai said, is to support voice search across different contexts, ranging from phones — where, we’d note, Google’s Android OS still dominates the global market — to homes, TVs and cars. “We want Google to be there for users when they need it.” Pichai said that Google Home’s first quarter on the market was “very strong” — without disclosing any shipment numbers — and reiterated that it was “very early days” for voice search. What’s more, he said there was still a lot of work ahead to make voice search a great experience for users — and that Google’s “years of progress” in areas like natural language processing were an advantage. “I feel very comfortable about how this will play out in the future.” What about making money from voice search? That was the question from another analyst, J.P. Morgan’s Douglas Anmuth. Short answer: It seems Google isn’t concerned with trying to squeeze revenue specifically from voice search in the near future. Instead, Pichai said that voice search was just part of a bigger search “journey” for Google’s users — an “end-to-end thing” that also includes mobile searches and other contexts where Google already has ad products at work. If Google can drive more voice searches, that’s just more information that can go into its broader ecosystem. “I see more opportunity than challenge when I think about voice search,” Pichai said.

Hilary Szymujko (@HilSzy), the head of program at IoT platform Brinc (@brinciot), penned a must-read guide for hardware startups that want to stand out. The main takeaway: focus on telling a story about the problem your product solves, and pare it down to the bare bones rather than wear listeners down with unnecessary details. “It’s very likely that whittling down your ideas and product into simple slides and explanations will take time and hard work,” Szymujko wrote. “But it will be worth it to achieve the core goals to be clear, be memorable, and inspire action.” Have you pitched a hardware product? Tell us your story: [email protected] Google Wants to Hear From Makers Search giant Google quietly launched a survey this week asking what sorts of smart tools makers might be interested in seeing from the company. A Google engineer told us the questionnaire is aimed at the “broader maker community,” with the goal of learning “more about perceptions on machine intelligence.” It’s an intriguing overture. Google’s relationship with hardware has always been noncommittal — this is the same corporation, remember, that bought and sold the entirety of Motorola in the span of just three years — but this survey could indicate a growing interest in maker-centric technologies. If so, this is a terrific opportunity to let the company know what you’d like to see. Fabrication Frontiers 3D printing outfit Sintavia has developed a process to print F357 aluminum and other foundry-grade alloys. The company anticipates marketing the technology to the aerospace and automotive industries. In a new post, Supplyframe (@Supplyframe) manager Chris Gammell (@Chris_Gammell) highlights an unexpected resource for prototypers: eBay. He points to Alan Yates (@vk2zay), who’s developed virtual reality hardware for both Valve and HTC, and recently recalled tearing down secondhand CD players in order to use the lasers in an early version of the Vive’s tracking system. “The use of eBay for prototyping may be non-standard, but the concept behind it is solid,” Gammell wrote. It’s difficult to appreciate just how fundamentally rapid prototyping tools have changed the modern workshop. DEVELOP3D (@develop3d) walks us through the history, from CNC machines to 3D printers. Maker Pro Builds Palm-Sized Drone Israeli orthodontist Hagay Klein would be glad to never see the inside of a patient’s mouth again, reports the Verge — and if he’s successful in selling a $99 pocket-sized drone he designed called Selfly, he might not have to. Klein sounds like the quintessential maker pro: he’s a long time tinkerer who’s built everything from model aircraft to a complex marble clock, and with Selfly, a drone that clips to a phone case, he thinks he’s hit on a concept he could spin up into a real business. “I hated it,” Klein said of his time in dentistry. “I would work one day a week and spend the other six building things.” Bearing in mind that crowdfunding drones is notoriously risky, Klein is currently raising funds on Kickstarter (@kickstarter). Elsewhere on the Maker Pro Web: MakerBot (@makerbot) CEO Jonathan Jaglom has resigned. The once-promising 3D printer venture has struggled since its 2013 acquisition by Stratasys (@Stratasys). Researchers at MIT (@MIT) have used a new technique to fuse graphene flakes into a material they say is ten times stronger than steel — and only five percent of steel’s density. Wired ran a worthwhile profile of Chinese phone maker Xiaomi (@xiaomi) this week. One takeaway: cheap Chinese goods can hurt high-end Chinese manufacturers as much as they do international entrepreneurs in Shenzhen. Save the date: Make Faire Chicago will take place on April 22–23 this year — and it’s going to be paired with the Chicago Comic and Entertainment Expo. A husband-and-wife North Carolina couple have started an organization called Lifenabled (@lifenabled) to fabricate personalized prostheses for patients in the developing world using 3D scanning, printing, and CNC milling.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Pixel 2 will have improved specs and features, might have a cheaper variant By Rei Padla - January 27, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter We can’t say much about the Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL because we’re hearing contrasting reviews about the two the past few weeks. There have been many issues about the Google phones but one thing is sure: Google is determined to fix them all. We may not quickly hear an official statement or acknowledgement but we know the company is working to make improvements and not just excuses. The Pixel and Pixel XL may soon get a new sibling in the form of the Pixel 2. We’re not certain about the name yet but we’re hearing the next phone by Google will be waterproof at least, and will have a batter camera, faster processors from two different OEMs, and will be more expensive than the current offerings. We also heard of the idea that Google is making its own custom chipset. There is also a possibility if not a higher-specced Pixel, a lower-end Pixel phone may be introduced. Another rumor has it that the next-gen Pixel will be great for low light photography. Megapixels of the Pixel 2 won’t be necessarily be bigger but will simply have better imaging software. There is also that possibility of more variants, something most top OEMs today usually do.

Apple is wildly profitable, but its results hinge on the fickle preferences of smartphone buyers who may or may not be moved by the iPhone's latest design. Amazon seems prepared to abandon quarterly profits to invest even more in faster delivery times or in another huge data centre. Facebook is still young enough that a little volatility is not out of character. But fourth-quarter results announced Thursday from Alphabet, Google's parent company, proved once again that the company is the model of money-making consistency. Alphabet's revenue in the quarter rose 22 per cent to $26.06 billion, beating analysts' expectations. Net income was $5.33 billion, up from $4.92 billion a year earlier. The heart of Alphabet's consistent earnings remains the company's search engine. While a consumer can delay an iPhone purchase or shop somewhere other than Amazon, Google's search engine is an indispensable tool for anyone using the Internet. The shift to mobile devices, once considered a threat to Google's search business, has only strengthened it. Google's market share on desktop search is around 78 per cent, but it is above 90 per cent on mobile devices, according to research from NetMarketShare.com. What is more, on smaller mobile displays, Google's ads occupy a large portion of the screen — making it more likely a user will click on them. Clicks on Google ads increased 36 per cent in the quarter, but what advertisers paid for each click decreased 15 per cent. Google is also sitting on many of the Internet's most valuable properties — the places where people go to stay in touch on email, find driving directions or seek out entertainment. While clicks on Google's ads across the Internet are rising, they are growing faster on its own websites such as YouTube. Alphabet does not break out results for YouTube, but the site continues to amass a huge audience. Google said more than one billion people watched YouTube every month, viewing hundreds of millions of hours of its videos every day. Sundar Pichai, Google's chief executive, said company assets like search, YouTube, Maps and Google Play constituted "prime time in the mobile era." Even Alphabet's unexpected hiccups are a little dull. The company's earnings per share were $7.56, or 11 cents below analysts' estimates. It said the reason for the shortfall was that it paid more in taxes. The company's effective tax rate for the quarter was 22 per cent, compared with five per cent in the same quarter a year earlier. Alphabet said it paid more in U.S. taxes but did not explain why. While the dominance of the Google search engine seems unassailable today, Alphabet is investing heavily in new technologies that may threaten its stronghold. Devices like the Amazon Echo, a voice-activated smart speaker, portend a future where artificially intelligent digital assistants fetch information without needing to access a search engine directly. During the quarter, Google introduced a smartphone called Pixel and Google Home, an Echo competitor. Both devices are vessels for the Google Assistant, the company's artificial intelligence system. To promote those devices, Alphabet said it spent more on marketing during the quarter. Alphabet said its cost of revenue — an indicator of its spending which also included other costs like operating data centres — rose 30 per cent during the quarter from a year earlier. Google did not provide figures for how those products sold, but the "other revenue" category, which included hardware sales along with revenue from Google Play, rose 62 per cent to $3.4 billion. Part of the company's financial stability came from Google's creation of Alphabet in 2015. The reorganization into a holding company split the company's core search business from a growing list of fledgling operations, like the newly minted Waymo — what used to be Google's self-driving car project until it was spun off as an independent Alphabet company in 2016. This move raised the pressure on the company's other bets, including its life sciences unit, Verily, and its home electronics unit, Nest, to prove that they could be profitable without the support of mother Google. In a sign of the independence of Alphabet companies, Verily announced Thursday that Singapore's sovereign fund, Temasek, will acquire a minority stake in Verily for $800 million. Under the watch of Ruth Porat, Alphabet's chief financial officer, the company has scaled back costs and — in some cases — the ambition of its speculative investments into new technologies. During the quarter, Alphabet said quarterly revenue from other bets rose 75 per cent to $262 million, while operating losses narrowed to $1.09 billion from $1.21 billion a year earlier.

Chris Nolter Jan 27, 2017 4:57 PM EST Google's Pixel phone debuted in the fourth quarter. Google CEO Sundar Pichai praised the "new family of beautiful hardware devices" that includes the new Pixel phone, during the company's fourth-quarter earnings call after the close on Thursday. However, Google parent Alphabet ( GOOGL) didn't disclose much detail on how well the new device sold. The phone debuted in October and is the first mobile device with Google Assistant built in. "We are thrilled with the reception as well as the really happy customers we saw over the holiday season," Pichai said about reaction to the Pixel and the Google Home voice-activated speaker and personal assistant. Shares of Alphabet closed Friday at $845.03, down 1.4%, after the company missed fourth-quarter earnings. After analyzing Alphabet's fourth-quarter numbers Friday, Deutsche Bank analyst Lloyd Walmsley estimated the company sold 1.5 million of the new phones, the only devices with Google Assistant built in. At an average price of $525 each, Walmsley notes, sales of the devices would come to $778 million in the quarter. Assuming that Alphabet spent $100 million on marketing for the Pixel, Walmsley expects sales of the device produced $233 million of gross profit in the quarter. Along with new features on YouTube and new cloud computing products, Pichai said the launches of the Pixel and Google Home products were Google's three "biggest bets" during the quarter. While data on the Pixel launch are lacking, the market's reaction seems favorable. Verizon (VZ) President of Operations John Stratton singled out the Pixel as the most notable phone to launch during the quarter during his company's earnings call Tuesday. Wells Fargo analyst Peter Stabler suggested the Pixel provided a lift to Google's hardware operations. "We view hardware as a mixed story where apparent success of Pixel phones could be offset by competitive challenges facing Google in catching up to [Amazon.com  (AMZN) ] in the fast-growing home assistant market," Stabler wrote. Artificial intelligence is becoming increasingly critical for the big tech players to differentiate their products and services. As the competition heats up among Google Assistant, Amazon's Alexa and Apple's (AAPL) Siri, the Pixel could serve as a showcase for Google's technology.

But its other wild bets are starting to make more money. Tech Industry by Richard Nieva January 26, 2017 1:37 PM PST @richardjnieva Up Next Beautiful scene shows universe is growing quicker than we knew Google has been scaling back on some of its moon shots. Justin Sullivan, Getty Images In the past few years, Google has become known for more than just its iconic search engine. You know, the one that tells you at a moment's notice the population of San Diego or what movie won the best picture Oscar in 1952 (1.3 million and "An American in Paris," respectively). It's also become known for its Jetson's-like ambitions: cars shuttling people around sans human drivers, high-flying balloons that beam Wi-Fi to remote regions, and nanoparticles that aim to detect cancer in early stages. When you describe something as "googley" in Silicon Valley, people know what you mean -- whimsical, scientific and with a dash of free food. It looks like some of those moon shots, called "Other Bets" in Google parlance, are starting to pay off. Google's parent company, Alphabet, said Thursday that, as a whole, those bets made $260 million in sales in the fourth quarter, compared to $150 million the year before. The costs associated with those bets also fell: The company spent $1.08 billion on Other Bets in the fourth quarter, versus $1.21 billion in the same period the year before. Alphabet also gave us a snapshot of how its business is doing overall. In the three months ended December 31, it recorded $26.06 billion in sales, surpassing analyst forecasts of $25.22 billion. Profit, after some costs, was $9.36 a share, falling short of analyst expectations of $9.67 per share. "We're seeing great momentum in Google's newer investment areas and ongoing strong progress in Other Bets," Ruth Porat, Alphabet's CFO, said in a statement. Moon shots downed In the last few months, Google has stepped up scrutiny of its moon shots, with some of them shut down or scaled back. There are a few reasons for that. Failure comes with the territory. Astro Teller, who runs the X lab, the self-described moon shot factory that develops most of the company's secretive projects, touts a now-cliched mantra: "Fail fast." "We work hard at X to make it safe to fail," Teller said during a keynote speech at South by Southwest last year. "We killed over 100 investigations last year alone." Another likely reason is Porat, chief money minder. A Morgan Stanley veteran, she arrived in March 2015 to great fanfare. "Ruthless Ruth," as she's reportedly called among Google's rank and file, is apparently notorious for cutting projects deemed too expensive or that haven't captured the excitement of Alphabet CEO Larry Page. "The internal transparency we've provided to our business leaders across the Other Bets and Google is helping us to allocate resources more thoughtfully across the opportunities that we see," Porat said during a conference call with analysts Thursday. It's hard to argue with her calls. After her first earnings report on the job, Google's market value swelled by $60 billion the next day, the biggest one-day gain for any company in history. But while that's no doubt tickled Wall Street, it's come at the expense of some of those pie-in-the-sky, dare-to-dream projects. Among some of the scaled-back efforts: the robotics division. It was started by Android creator Andy Rubin, who built it up thanks to an acquisition spree that included at least 11 companies in 2013. But after Rubin left Google in 2014, the effort was rudderless. The robotics division was eventually swallowed up by X, before Teller put the kibosh on it completely. The company also decided to halt expansion of its high-speed internet service, called Fiber, though it will continue operations in eight cities where it's already in place. Google also scaled back its efforts with drones and is now mostly focusing on trying to use them as a delivery service for things like pizza and groceries instead of for spreading internet connectivity. "As we reach for moon shots that will have a big impact in the longer-term, it's inevitable that there will be course corrections along the way," Porat said in October. "Some efforts will be more successful than others." CNET Magazine: Check out a sampling of the stories you'll find in CNET's newsstand edition.

Under the new video algorithm the amount of time spent watching a video will improve its ranking in news feeds. That means a half-watched long video will get a better ranking than a half-watched short video.   Play Video Replay Video Play Video Don't Play Up Next Pokemon GO's staggering profit Play Video Don't Play Video duration 00:49 More Digital Life Videos Previous slide Next slide Video duration 01:00 Mark Zuckerberg rejects 'fake news' charge Mark Zuckerberg rejects 'fake news' charge The Facebook CEO dismisses claims that 'fake news' shared on the social network may have influenced the outcome of the 2016 US presidential election.

More videos Mark Zuckerberg rejects 'fake news' charge The Facebook CEO dismisses claims that 'fake news' shared on the social network may have influenced the outcome of the 2016 US presidential election. It is one of many changes that Facebook has made in recent years to the secret algorithm that decides which videos will be shared in newsfeeds. Two years ago Facebook started giving higher rankings to videos that were watched with the sound on or in a full screen.  In March 2016 it announced Live Videos would be ranked higher.   And three years ago it announced video rankings would depend "whether someone has watched a video and for how long they watched it", but this didn't take the length of the video into account.  SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Screen shot from Empire News' Facebook feed.  Photo: Facebook "Today, we're announcing a change to the way we rank videos in NewsFeed to adjust the value we give to how much of a video is watched," Facebook's product manager Abhishek Bapna and research scientist Seyoung Park wrote in a blog post published on January 26.  Facebook will now look at "per cent completion" to work out which videos people actually watch and rank those videos higher.  Advertisement "As we continue to understand how our community consumes video, we've realised that we should therefore weight per cent completion more heavily the longer a video is, to avoid penalising longer videos."  "As always, Pages should focus on creating videos that are relevant and engaging to their audiences ...The best length for a video is whatever length is required to tell a compelling story that engages people, which is likely to vary depending on the story you're telling."  SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg delivering the keynote address at the F8 Facebook Developer Conference, in San Francisco.  Photo: AP These latest changes relate to shared videos in news feeds. But late last year Facebook discovered it was overstating its metrics to advertisers, who pay to promote videos. Constant changes to metrics and rankings are starting to wear down marketers, who rely on Facebook to reach their audience.  Facebook announced on January 25 it would start counting the number of sources reporting news, rather than the number of readers, to determine what gets counted as trending news.

Prntly has been identified as a source of fakenews.  Photo: Facebook This should deliver a "broader range of news and events" and "help ensure that trending topics reflect real world events being covered by multiple news outlets".  "Today's update may also help prevent hoaxes and fake news from appearing in Trending because the updated system identifies groups of articles shared on Facebook instead of relying solely on mentions of a topic," vice president of product management, Will Cathcart, noted.  SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Facebook is changing rankings for videos, again.  Photo: Communications director at Melbourne advertising agency The Royals, Andrew Reeves, said staying up to date with Facebook's ranking system is "a cost of doing business with Facebook" "The bigger question for us is how this change impacts our thinking about creative output – because 'completion rate' is not necessarily a metric we judge our work on (it's not like every piece of content is a TV commercial with a punchline) – or is it what our clients want from us," Mr Reeves said.  "Overall what's more concerning about Facebook are the changes and constant oversights, re-labelling, and adjusting of accountability metrics ... Facebook's changing [of] how things are measured does in some way start to erode trust and bring into question whether those measures are actually reflective of genuine performance."  0 comments Log in to comment New User?

Email Newsletters Sign up for one of our email newsletters. Astrobotic, a Pittsburgh-based space startup company, is in line to receive a slice of a $1 million “Diversity Prize” from Google's Lunar XPrize despite formally dropping out of the race to the moon last month. Google and XPrize announced Tuesday that it would split the Diversity Prize among 16 current and past teams. “XPrize and Google have been awestruck by the educational outreach activities conducted by all of the competing teams and have decided to split the $1 million Diversity Prize across all 16 teams to recognize each of their unique approaches and initiatives over the years,” Chanda Gonzales-Mowrer, senior director of the Google Lunar XPrize, said in a statement. “Each of these teams has pushed the boundaries to demonstrate that you don't have to be a government superpower to send a mission to the moon, while inspiring audiences to pursue the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.” Five teams remain in the competition. The teams must land on the moon, travel 500 meters across its surface and send high-definition video and images back to Earth by the end of 2017 to win the $20 million prize. Astrobotic, a Carnegie Mellon University spinoff company headquartered in the Strip District, bowed out of the competition in December when its CEO John Thornton said the company would not be ready for a 2017 launch. Thornton said the company still intends to land on the moon and establish itself as a lunar delivery service. Thornton said he doubts any of the remaining teams actually will land on the moon by the end of the year. The five remaining teams are: • SpaceIL, an Israeli nonprofit that plans to launch on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket; • Moon Express, a Florida-based company flying on a Rocket Lab USA rocket; • Synergy Moon, an international collaboration that will use an ocean-launched rocket from California-based Interorbital Systems; • TeamIndus, an Indian team launching on the Indian Space Research Organizations Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle; and, • HAKUTO, a Japanese company whose rover will catch a ride with TeamIndus to the moon.

Scroll down for video  Apple has joined an artificial Intelligence (AI) research group alongside other tech giants of the world. The firm has been involved with the group since last year, but has formalized its membership together with Amazon, Facebook Google/DeepMind, IBM and Microsoft The birth of AI has made our lives easier, but the more advance it becomes, the more some worry about what the future holds. And experts have been verbal about the nightmare that may lay ahead. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Google Maps can now warn you BEFORE you leave the house if...

Share this article Share 12 shares Stephen Hawking has warned that AI 'has the potential to evolve faster than the human race' and stated that 'we need to ensure AI is designed ethically, with safeguards in place'- this is where Partnership on AI comes in. 'The objective of the Partnership on AI is to address opportunities and challenges with AI technologies to benefit people and society,' the group said during its launch in September. PARTNERSHIP ON AI RULES 1. We will seek to ensure that AI technologies benefit and empower as many people as possible. 2. We will educate and listen to the public and actively engage stakeholders to seek their feedback on our focus, inform them of our work, and address their questions. 3. We are committed to open research and dialog on the ethical, social, economic, and legal implications of AI. 4. We believe that AI research and development efforts need to be actively engaged with and accountable to a broad range of stakeholders. The objective of the Partnership on AI is to address opportunities and challenges with AI technologies to benefit people and society 5. We will engage with and have representation from stakeholders in the business community to help ensure that domain-specific concerns and opportunities are understood and addressed. 6. We will work to maximize the benefits and address the potential challenges of AI technologies, by: Working to protect the privacy and security of individuals. Striving to understand and respect the interests of all parties that may be impacted by AI advances. Working to ensure that AI research and engineering communities remain socially responsible, sensitive, and engaged directly with the potential influences of AI technologies on wider society. Ensuring that AI research and technology is robust, reliable, trustworthy, and operates within secure constraints. Opposing development and use of AI technologies that would violate international conventions or human rights, and promoting safeguards and technologies that do no harm. 7. We believe that it is important for the operation of AI systems to be understandable and interpretable by people, for purposes of explaining the technology. 8. We strive to create a culture of cooperation, trust, and openness among AI scientists and engineers to help us all better achieve these goals.    Partnership on AI says plans to 'conduct research, recommend best practices, and publish research under an open license in areas such as ethics, fairness and inclusivity; transparency, privacy, and interoperability; collaboration between people and AI systems; and the trustworthiness, reliability and robustness of the technology' And now, Apple is the latest newcomer in helping the mission. 'We're glad to see the industry engaging on some of the larger opportunities and concerns created with the advance of machine learning and AI, Tom Gruber, head of advanced development of Siri, shared in a statement. The growth of AI is slowing making the lives of humans easier, but it is also increasing concerns over the future of humanity. And experts have been very verbal about the nightmare, similar to what happened in Terminator, that may lay ahead 'We believe it's beneficial to Apple, our customers, and the industry to play an active role in its development and look forward to collaborating with the group to help drive discussion on how to advance AI while protecting the privacy and security of consumers.' In addition to Apple joining, Partnership on AI also brought on six new independent board members. The new members will join Greg Corrado (Google/DeepMind), Tom Gruber (Apple), Ralf Herbrich (Amazon), Eric Horvitz (Microsoft), Yann Lecun (Facebook), and Francesca Rossi (IBM) on our Board of Trustees, to create a board that strikes a balance between corporate and not-for-profit memberships. WILL ROBOTS TAKE OUR JOBS?  As robots increasingly make their way into the workforce, some have argued that they will soon be taking over many traditionally human jobs. In an interview with Fox Business, former McDonalds USA CEO Ed Rensi argued that the $15/hour minimum wage raise will bring 'job loss like you can't believe.' He argued that it would be cheaper for companies to instead purchase robotic devices. 'If you look at the robotic devices that are coming into the restaurant industry -- it's cheaper to buy a $35,000 robotic arm than it is to hire an employee who's inefficient making $15 an hour bagging French fries,' Rensi said. Foxconn, a supplier for Apple and Samsung, has already reduced its human workforce drastically, The South China Morning Post reports. One factory has now 'reduced employee strength from 110,000 to 50,000, thanks to the introduction of robots,' an official told the Post. And, they predict more companies will soon follow, with up to 600 firms reporting similar plans in a government survey.  'We passionately believe in the potential for it to transform in a positive way our world,' said Mustafa Suleyman, head of applied A.I. for DeepMind, an artificial intelligence development company acquired by Google in 2014. 'We believe it's critical now to start to think about new models of engagement with the public, new models of collaboration across the industry and new models of transparency around the work that we do.' The first meeting of the Board of Trustees is taking place on Friday, February 3rd in San Francisco, and the group plans to share the details 'shortly after' the meeting.    Share or comment on this article e-mail 12 shares Most watched News videos 'There goes that relationship' Trump's quip to BBC question Graphic: NZ Breakers player's eye dislodged in horrific injury Pizza Hut customer finds workers in the back of empty restaurant in Bristol Shocking CCTV shows car speed into Humber Bridge barrier Heartwarming scene as Grayce shares her puppies with owner Florida couple passed out in their car with two children in the backseat A close look at the huge crack formed across Arizona desert Bizarre footage of multiple UFOs hovering near Mexican border Enraged man punches laptop and quits job during 'meltdown' at airport Alarming moment guy violently pushes man onto tube tracks CCTV shows brave man fighting nunchuck-wielding robbers Inauguration etiquette 101: Escort First Lady up White House steps First ladies first?

Microsoft topped projections on the strength of rising customer sign-ups for its cloud offerings like Azure, which saw revenue almost double. Intel sales rose more than expected, helped by orders for processors that power data-centre servers - the machines at the heart of cloud computing. Although profit at Google parent Alphabet disappointed, the numbers signalled that heavy spending to catch cloud leaders Amazon.com and Microsoft is paying off. Google's Other Revenue line, which includes cloud computing, jumped 62 per cent to US$3.4 billion (S$4.8 billion) in the fourth quarter. "Our cloud business is on a terrific upswing," Google chief executive officer Sundar Pichai said on Thursday. "I definitely think we're going to have a great year." What started a decade ago as an easy way for start-ups to run websites has turned into an increasingly popular way for companies of all sizes to access the software needed to run their operations. Many big technology companies are in a strong position to provide this because they already have huge data centres to support their own Web services. MICROSOFT NET INCOME $5.2b REVENUE $24.1b ALPHABET NET INCOME $5.33b REVENUE $26.06b INTEL NET INCOME $3.6b REVENUE $16.4b All figures for the fourth quarter in US dollars SOURCE: REUTERS More than US$1 trillion in IT spending will be directly or indirectly affected by the shift to cloud computing during the next five years, research firm Gartner estimated last July. "This will make cloud computing one of the most disruptive forces of IT spending since the early days of the digital age," it added. Stock prices reflect this optimism. Microsoft and Alphabet shares hit a record this week, and Intel stock recently came close to an all-time high set in October. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has been working to reposition the company around such Internet services. In addition to robust demand for Azure, consumers and corporations continue to buy Office 365, a cloud-based version of the company's productivity software that includes Word and Excel. Almost 25 million consumers are subscribed to Office 365, Microsoft said, and sales rose 47 per cent in the fiscal second quarter. "As long as cloud is growing, people are happy," said Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Mark Moerdler, who rates Microsoft shares outperform. "If margins are growing, people are even happier." Microsoft has been spending on data centres and adding products to win new cloud customers. Chief financial officer Amy Hood last July said gross margins, a measure of profitability, for the commercial cloud business would "materially improve" in the current year. This is because previous years of investment are starting to pay off as those data centres support more customers. Microsoft has pledged to reach annualised revenue of US$20 billion in its corporate cloud business by the fiscal year ending June 2018. That metric stood at more than US$14 billion at the end of the second quarter. Intel's fourth-quarter sales of server chips to cloud service providers jumped 30 per cent from a year earlier. "It's moving to the public cloud, it's moving to those areas at a faster rate than I think we expected," said Intel CEO Brian Krzanich on a conference call. Amazon reports earnings next week and RBC Capital Markets expects the company's AWS cloud business to generate US$3.6 billion in fourth-quarter revenue, up 50 per cent from the year before. Mr Moerdler said: "Amazon is much bigger, but still Amazon and Microsoft are pulling away from the pack."

PHOTO: ST FILE PublishedJan 28, 2017, 5:00 am SGT More Share Tweet Linkedin Pin Google+ Reddit Print Purchase Article Permalink: http://str.sg/4muQ Copy Temasek Holdings will invest US$800 million (S$1.1 billion) in Alphabet's medical arm Verily, which is working to bring some of its creations to market. Temasek will get a minority stake in the company and will nominate a director to its operating board, according to a statement issued yesterday. The bulk of the money will be pumped into Verily in the coming days, while the rest will come in the second half of this year, Verily said in the statement. For Verily, which has been funded by Google's massive advertising revenue to date, an investment by Temasek could signal an expansion into China, where Temasek has its largest underlying asset exposure after Singapore. "With a substantial network and insights into the economies in Asia, Temasek will provide valuable guidance as we look to ex-US markets with our development partners," Verily chief executive officer Andrew Conrad said in the statement. Verily, formerly known as Google Life Sciences, was rebranded after Google's parent company became Alphabet in a corporate restructuring. Verily is among Alphabet's "big bets" as the Silicon Valley giant goes beyond its core and lucrative online search business for innovative new opportunities. Verily, known formerly as Google Life Sciences, was rebranded after Google's parent company became Alphabet in a corporate restructuring. Verily is among Alphabet's "big bets" as the Silicon Valley giant goes beyond its core and lucrative online search business for innovative new opportunities. The medical firm specialises in applying technology to problems in health and biology, and has been discussing ideas such as building a sickness-sensing diagnostic device. Verily said it is creating tools and easy-to-use platforms to gather deep and broad sets of health information and organise them in ways that let action be taken. Last year, Verily teamed up with French pharmaceutical firm Sanofi to "combine devices, software, medicine and professional care" to manage diabetes. Verily also collaborates with Britain-based GlaxoSmithKline on "bioelectronic medicine", which it described as treating ailments by using miniature, implantable devices that can modify the body's electrical signals. Temasek, on the other hand, has a portfolio covering telecommunications, media, finance and life sciences sectors around the world. Its portfolio value stood at $242 billion as of March 31 last year. Temasek recently said it had increased its focus on North American technology ventures and established an office in San Francisco late last year. Its largest United States-based investment is in Chinese e-commerce player Alibaba, with a stake valued at about US$3.7 billion. It also raised its stake in Chinese e-commerce firm JD.com from 0.54 per cent to about 0.64 per cent last year, according to filings in the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Temasek's life sciences portfolio investments include a stake in biopharmaceutical firm Gilead Sciences, while in 2015, it took a stake in North American chemical distributor Univar.

Microsoft topped projections on the strength of rising customer sign-ups for its cloud offerings like Azure, which saw revenue almost double. Intel sales rose more than expected, helped by orders for processors that power data-centre servers -- the machines at the heart of cloud computing. While profit at Google parent Alphabet disappointed, the numbers also signalled that heavy spending to catch cloud leaders Amazon.com and Microsoft is paying off. Google’s Other Revenue line, which includes cloud computing, jumped 62 per cent to US$3.4 billion in the fourth quarter. “Our cloud business is on a terrific upswing,” Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said Thursday during a conference call with analysts. “I definitely think we’re going to have a great year.” What started a decade ago as an easy way for startups to run websites has turned into an increasingly popular way for companies of all sizes to access the software needed to run their operations. Many big technology companies are in a strong position to provide this because they already have huge data centres to support their own web services. More than US$1 trillion in IT spending will be directly or indirectly affected by the shift to cloud during the next five years, Gartner estimated in July. “This will make cloud computing one of the most disruptive forces of IT spending since the early days of the digital age,” the research firm said at the time. After 17 years, Microsoft’s market value tops US$500 billion again Stock prices reflect this optimism. Microsoft and Alphabet shares hit a record this week. Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella has been working to reposition the company around such internet services. In addition to robust demand for Azure, consumers and corporations continue to purchase Office 365, a cloud-based version of the company’s productivity software that includes Word and Excel. Almost 25 million consumers are now subscribed to Office 365, Microsoft said, and sales increased 47 per cent in the fiscal second quarter. “As long as cloud is growing, people are happy,” said Mark Moerdler, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., who rates Microsoft shares outperform. “If margins are growing, people are even happier.” Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft has been spending on data centres and adding products to win new cloud customers. Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said in July that gross margins, a measure of profitability, for the commercial cloud business would “materially improve” in the current year. That’s because previous years of investment are starting to pay off as those data centres support more customers. Microsoft has pledged to reach annualised revenue of US$20 billion in its corporate cloud business by the fiscal year that ends in June 2018. That metric stood at more than US$14 billion at the end of the second quarter. Intel’s fourth-quarter sales of server chips to cloud service providers jumped 30 per cent from a year earlier. Offsetting that, companies and government agencies spent 7 per cent less than they had in the same quarter in 2016 on equipping their in-house computer rooms, the company said. “It’s moving to the public cloud, it’s moving to those areas at a faster rate than I think we expected,” Intel Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich said on a conference call. Amazon reports earnings next week and analysts at RBC Capital Markets expect the company’s AWS cloud business to generate US$3.6 billion in fourth-quarter revenue, up 50 per cent from a year earlier. “Microsoft is the plumbing in the cloud,” Moerdler said. “Amazon is much bigger, but still Amazon and Microsoft are pulling away from the pack.”   Most Popular Viewed 1 China tightens Great Firewall, outlawing unauthorised VPNs 2 Hard times ahead for China’s economy, says Alibaba’s Jack Ma 3 US$15 million computer system to tackle cybersecurity 4 Alibaba’s shares rise on higher full-year revenue forecast 5 China sets up 100 billion yuan state fund to invest in the internet Shared 1 China tightens Great Firewall, outlawing unauthorised VPNs 2 Prepare for robotics, AI to worsen the backlash of globalisation 3 Hard times ahead for China’s economy, says Alibaba’s Jack Ma 4 Internet+ turning into a buzzword in China 5 China sets up 100 billion yuan state fund to invest in the internet Commented 1 Don’t be duped, China’s foreign reserves are no savings at all 2 Hong Kong tops list of world’s most expensive cities for housing 3 The Chinese investor who says female CEOs are bad for business 4 Pay day in Hong Kong actually means you are paid 5 Trump officially pulls US out of TPP trade deal Promotions Register for a free copy of Home Essentials 2017 now       You may also like World Trump taps ex-Hong Kong businessman for US Navy secretary 26 Jan 2017 - 10:14pm 7 Smart-home kits keep pet owners connected In partnership with: HKT PREMIER Hong Kong Canadian Chinese man loses bid to help son acquire HK passport 26 Jan 2017 - 9:26am 14 Optical-fibre sensing technology offers double railway monitoring Sponsored by: The Hong Kong Polytechnic University Hong Kong Joshua Wong hopes Netflix airing of film will raise awareness 26 Jan 2017 - 12:23am 56 China Millions on the move in China’s Lunar New Year rush 25 Jan 2017 - 3:04pm 3 Hong Kong Hong Kong denies Beijing role in seizure of Singaporean troop carriers 26 Jan 2017 - 4:13pm 72 China invests billions in the US ... who gets the most? 25 Jan 2017 - 1:36pm 2 Geopolitics Hong Kong to return seized armoured vehicles to Singapore 25 Jan 2017 - 12:24pm 87 China How does China’s ‘One Belt, One Road’ match up against the TPP? 24 Jan 2017 - 11:17pm 3 China China tightens Great Firewall, outlawing unauthorised VPNs 23 Jan 2017 - 11:26pm 26 Lifestyle Lunar New Year feng shui: how to decorate your home Jan 25th 2017, 5:42pm South China Morning Post Stay connected Facebook Twitter Hong Kong Politics Economy Health & Environment Law & Crime Education & Community News China Hong Kong Asia World China Policies & Politics Diplomacy & Defence Money & Wealth Society Economy Tech Business Companies Markets Property Investor Relations Mutual Funds Economy China Economy Money & Wealth Country Reports Tech China Tech Enterprises Social & Gadgets Start-ups Apps & Gaming Innovation Leaders & Founders Science & Research E-Commerce Lifestyle Arts & Entertainment Health & Beauty Film & TV Food & Drink Families Music Fashion & Luxury Books Travel & Leisure Watches Sport Hong Kong China Golf Racing Rugby Soccer Tennis Boxing Comment Insight & Opinion Harry's View Blogs Polls Letters Multimedia Video Photos Infographics SCMP Chronicles Magazine Post Magazine Style Good Eating Destination Macau HK Magazine Archive Other Weather Most Popular 7 Days Index Country Reports Crossword Promotions Directories Luxehomes At your service Business Services Directory MICE Biz Restaurant Directory Information Buy SCMP Photos Copyright Licensing RSS Feeds SCMP.com search Historical Archive Print Subscription Advertising Opportunities Contact our Advertising Sales HK Rate card Overseas Rate Card China Rate Card The Marketer SCMP Marketing Solutions SCMP Outdoor Advertising Recruitment Advertising Events SCMP Events Operation Santa Claus Other Sites CPJobs.com Education Post Young Post Cosmopolitan CosmoGIRL!

Skip to content To Inform is to Influence IO, SC, PD, what's in a name? Menu About Information Operations Holistic Organizers IO, Cyber, SC, PD Community Calendar Fake News Google banned 200 publishers since it passed a new policy against fake news January 27, 2017 Joel Harding News in the section ‘Context’ are not fakes. We publish them in order to provide you with a deeper understanding of the techniques and methods used by the Russian government in its information war. January 26, 2017 – 19:50 Context The company routinely weeds out “bad ads.” Now it weeds out more bad ad publishers, too. Hugh Peterswald /Pacific Press/LightRocket / Getty Google kicked 200 publishers off one of its ad networks in the fourth quarter, partly in response to the proliferation of fake news sites. The company banned the publishers from its AdSense network, an ad placement service that automatically serves text and display ads on participating sites based on its audience. The ban was part of an update to an existing policy that prohibits sites that mislead users with their content. Google regularly weeds out advertisers for false or misleading claims, but impersonating news sites became an addition following the rapid rise of fake news, or propaganda sites. After the election, Google was blasted for placing a false story from a fake news site claiming Donald Trump had won the popular vote. (He had 2.8 million fewer votes than Hillary Clinton.) Not all 200 publishers were swept up as part of the effort to root out fake news sites. Publishers were banned in November and December and included sites that impersonate real news organizations through shortened top-level domains, according to Google’s 2016 “bad ads” report, normally released at the beginning of each year. So-called fake news publishers will sometimes take advantage of “.co” domains by appearing similar to legitimate news sites that would normally end in “.com.” Google declined to provide a listing of the banned sites. Separately, the annual report on violations of advertising policy also included data on ads removed by Google. The company reported that in 2016 it took down 1.7 billion ads for violations, compared to 780 million in 2015. Google attributes the increase in ad removals to a combination of advertiser behavior and improvements in technology to detect offending ads. Google added a policy mid-year to prohibit ads for payday loans, considered predatory. Roughly five million payday loan ads were disabled over the latter six months of 2016. Also among those the removed ads were what Google calls “tabloid cloakers.” These advertisers run what look like links to news headlines, but when the user clicks, an ad for a product such as a weight loss supplement pops up. Google suspended 1,300 accounts engaged in tabloid cloaking in 2016. Correction: the original headline stated 200 publishers were banned in a three month period, when it was actually less than two months.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish iPhone 7 Review By Hubert Nguyen on 01/27/2017 12:45 PST The iPhone celebrates its 10th year in 2017, and there’s no question that it is a huge force in the smartphone market. It is also more than half of Apple’s business, and as Apple’s flagship product, it competes at the highest level against a very strong Android competition. If you read this review, you are probably weighing if you should buy an iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus and assuming that your budget allows, your options may fall into one of those three: Should I upgrade from my current iPhone? Should I pick the iPhone 7 or 7 Plus? Should I pick this iPhone or an Android competitor? There are other situations, but we’ll answer these common questions directly, and the review should help you make a decision even if your situation is a bit more complex. In this review, we’ll use the iPhone 7 Plus because it is a superset of the iPhone 7, but we will point out the differences (battery capacity, screen size+resolution, camera capabilities). Industrial Design (good, classic) The iPhone 7 Plus with the dual-camera in the back The iPhone 7 keeps the general “design language” of the iPhone 6/6s and its predecessor. Although there are differences, the proportions and shape are extremely similar, and if you put it in a case, this generation is hard to tell apart from the previous ones, unless you look closely. Apple has improved antenna gaps design, making them less obvious. The iPhone 7 has a continuous metal surface in the back, and the antenna gaps are only visible from the sides. That, and the larger camera bump (for a good reason) are the most visible changes. As usual, Apple doesn’t have any branding on the front, which is nice (this is the first design feature that every OEM should go for). In the back, the Apple logo is low-key, and these choices have contributed to the agreeable visual appearance of iPhones. New Home button The home button is no longer a button that you press, but a capacitive button which is capable of sending a tactile feedback like a buzz, thanks to a Taptic Engine. This taptic feedback can emit different kinds of “buzzes” depending on the context. For example, calls may get a different buzz “rhythm” than emails. App developers could also create their buzz patterns. The new Home button is pressure-sensitive so different levels of pressure may induce different actions/responses. The taptic feedback resembles nothing like the press of a button. Instead, it feels like the phone simply emits an ultra-short “buzz”. If your fingerprint isn’t recognized, a longer buzz happens: I feel like the phone is micro-vibrating up and down with that one. Weird, but OK. Some people are annoyed by the new button design, but I don’t mind it much. I don’t think that it makes life better, but saying that it makes life much worse is exaggerated. However, if the taptic is “the” justification to remove the 3.5mm audio connector, then I’m not convinced by the logic or the added-value. No 3.5 mm audio “jack” connector The iPhone is the first major smartphone to get rid of the 3.5mm audio connector. The good news is that an adapter is included in the box ($9 if you need to buy another). The bad news is that you need an “Apple Lightning-to-3.5mm” adapter, and sometimes you won’t have it on hand because people just don’t walk around with their dongles all the time. Many will be lost as well. By itself, the adapter is OK, and there’s an argument to say that 3.5mm had been around for a long time, and could/should be replaced by a new interface. However, it’s not something people “asked for” (what’s the immediate benefit?). Many hate it; few love it — just vote with your wallet… It is what is it, and the rumor is that more (Android) OEMs will drop the audio connector. We’ll know next month if that’s true or not. Since the Lighting port is now used to connect headphones, you cannot charge your phone while connecting wired headphones via the adapter. For that, you need another adapter which has a second charging port. Apple proposes a Belkin audio+charge adapter for… $40 (ouch). Water resistance: IP67 For the first time, the iPhone gets a water-resistance rating of IP67, which means that a device is dust tight: no dust can penetrate. It can also withstand up to 1-meter (~1 yard) immersion for a limited duration without harm the device (tested for 30mn). Learn more about IP Ratings. Although some phones have a slightly superior IP68 rating, we consider that IP67 is a very good start, and should contribute to significantly avoid situations where the phone will “die” due to water exposure. The main difference between IP67 and IP68 is that IP68 phones can support underwater pressure at a depth of 3 meters (~3 yards). Note that although not IP rated, some iPhone 6s have been seen surviving in water. Without the IP rating, the survivability cannot be trusted to be considered consistent, but it’s a good sign that a design may have “partial” water resistance. Older iPhones had water sensors that once tripped would “kill” the phone immediately and definitively (probably to avoid short circuits and burns). It was not uncommon that people would kill their phones by sweating on them during a heavy workout, or after splashing a bit of water at the wrong place. When it comes to real-world water survivability, there is a grey zone, and things are never black and white. Keep in mind that most phones rated for IP67 or IP68 water resistance do not have warranty coverage for water damage… so I recommend thinking of the water resistance as the last line of defense. Jet Black Edition: beautiful, but needs care The iPhone 7 is optionally available in “Jet Black”, a beautiful polished ceramic finish. It is expensive, but I love the finish and its intense black color. Apple isn’t the first company to do this, and others such as OnePlus have also successfully produced ceramic finish surfaces. Price aside, this works better for people who take great care of their phones. This kind of ceramic isn’t as hard as glass. When the highly polished surface gets those little scratches, it becomes duller. Apple recommends using a case to protect the ceramic, but one has to wonder what the point is in having this beautiful surface, just to put a case on top of it, even a clear one. “The high-gloss finish of the jet black iPhone 7 is achieved through a precision nine-step anodization and polishing process. Its surface is equally as hard as other anodized Apple products; however, its high shine may show fine micro-abrasions with use” (Apple) Some people have reported that the finish is holding fine, while others have reported micro-scratches, just as Apple warn. At the moment, there isn’t hard data to go by, but we encourage being cautious. Design conclusion The iPhone’s design is quite good, but it’s hard to be “wowed” by its novelty. The iPhone 7 looks like the iPhone 6S, which looks like the iPhone 6. There are some aesthetic improvements, but it feels the same and doesn’t improve things like Display-to-Body ratio or bezel size. Maybe a sign of the times is that many phone OEMs are now copying Samsung’s Galaxy S6/S7 Edge design by going with curved edges and dual-sided glass over a thin layer of colored metal. If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, Apple has lost its leadership position. Camera (very good) Quick Specs 12 Megapixel main camera, f1.8 aperture 12 Megapixel 2X zoom secondary camera (iPhone 7 Plus only), f2.8 aperture Optical Image Stabilization (OIS) New on iPhone 7, already present in iPhone 6S Plus Quad LED flash Opinon: What’s a Great Mobile Camera Experience? From a technical standpoint, there are a few things to highlight with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. First, the iPhone 7 (the small one) gets Optical Image Stabilization (OIS), which is critical for low-light situations. Secondly, the larger iPhone 7 Plus has a second camera in the back, which has a higher focal length (native 2X zoom/telephoto). Learn more: What is Image Stabilization? In broad daylight, most high-end phones are doing very well, and although there are differences at times, users are usually happy with the photos. In this shot of a San Francisco office entry, both images are great, with the S7 Edge being a bit more saturated and contrasted. Those differences are often an aesthetic choice in Photo Image Quality (IQ) tuning rather than a technical problem. iPhone 7 Plus: f1.8, 1/272 exposure, ISO-20, 28mm focal, 2.25MB (4032×3024) S7 Edge: f1.7, 1/315 exposure, ISO-50, 26mm focal, 3.37MB (4032×3024) With high-contrast daylight photos, things get more difficult. This tree photo shows how both cameras handle HDR, to compensate for the difference in contrast between the bright sky behind the tree (the sun on the upper-left of the tree is stronger than you would think). *I noticed that the S7 Edge tends to save much larger files, possibly due to a lower JPG compression setting. This is a challenging shot for any camera. Many would lose a lot of details in the leaves, but in this photo, the iPhone captures the leaves details. You can see that the S7 Edge captures a much more colorful and contrasted image. I didn’t have the Google Pixel with me then, but the Pixel would probably output a photo similar to the S7. Also, the photo of the iPhone 7 feels a bit “hazy”. I found the crisp photo of the S7 to be more representative of the scene (minus the slightly more saturated colors, maybe). In this particular shot, a ranking would look like: Galaxy S7 iPhone 7 Plus Huawei P9 (a bit dark) Huawei Mate 9 (too hazy) iPhone 7 Plus: f1.8, 1/1520 exposure, ISO-20, 28mm focal, 1.90MB (4032×3024) S7 Edge: f1.7, 1/1836 exposure, ISO-50, 26mm focal, 2.94MB (4032×3024) Low-light photography Low light photography takes everything to the extreme and represents the most challenging situation for imaging systems. I’ll post a few examples here, but maybe this photo of a school is a good representation of the iPhone 7/7Plus vs. Galaxy S7 experience. The Google Pixel is close to the S7, although with some variations of its own. iPhone 7 Plus: f1.8, 1/15 exposure, ISO-400, 28mm focal, 2.18MB (4032×3024) S7 Edge: f1.7, 1/10 exposure, ISO-640, 26mm focal, 3.72MB (4032×3024) This is a school which has a very colorful mural, and it was interesting to take a photo at night (with the floodlights) to see how this would come out. As you can observe, the iPhone 7 photo does well, and an iPhone 6S would have been in a more precarious situation here. At first glance, the Galaxy S7 has more vivid colors and seems to have sharper edges and details. Also, you may notice that the Galaxy S7 exhibits more noise because it uses a higher ISO setting for that shot. The sharpening would make the noise even more visible. The image above is a crop of the first two photos so you can see better what’s going on. Again, it’s pretty obvious the that the S7 has more saturated and defined colors, but you can also see that the details are better while the higher contrast doesn’t suppress any significant detail. Interestingly, the Galaxy S7 manages to get a sharper photo, despite having an exposure time that is significantly longer. The OIS, but also the image alignment algorithm and sharpener are responsible for this. Secondary camera: iPhone 7 Plus only The secondary iPhone 7 Plus camera has a different focal length which makes it a 2X optical zoom relative the regular camera, which Apple calls “wide lens”. In this review, I’ll refer to the cameras as “main camera” (normal zoom) and “zoom camera” (2X zoom). The “normal zoom” camera isn’t really “wide”. It has a focal length similar to the previous iPhone and comparable to most normal smartphone cameras. If you want to see a real “wide” camera, check the LG G5 or LG V20 which both feature a uniquely wide camera. The iPhone 7 user can zoom normally, and the Camera app will use either or both lens data to take a good photo. Because both cameras have very different low-light capabilities, Apple seems to fall back on the normal camera if the low light conditions are severe, even if you are trying to zoom (it will do a normal crop). In low-light situations, the zoom camera isn’t good enough, so the Camera app will opt to shoot with the normal camera, and just crop the image. In broad daylight, and with high zoom settings 5X-10X, the iPhone’s zoom does make a visible difference, although don’t expect miracles: the image is still a bit fuzzy, but not as much. Is the telephoto lens really useful? It depends on YOUR usage Usually, when you zoom, it’s because you cannot get closer to the subject. You may be at the zoo, at a conference or at a concert. The general rule is: don’t use the zoom anytime you can get a bit closer. Also, the zoom camera is likely not to be utilized by the Camera app if the lighting conditions are too severe. Now, it’s true that the higher the zoom, and the more the iPhone should shine. That’s because as other phones have to magnify (up-sample) and filter an image, the more it should look fuzzy. Obviously. For example, I shot a photo of a scooter that was parked across a street. You can see that the iPhone 7 Plus photo is clearly better, with more details, even though the color-balance of the S7 Edge is a bit closer to the actual scene in this example. Convinced? My opinion of the iPhone 7 zoom lens is that it is not as useful as a “real” wide lens such as the LG V20’s. With the V20, there are many shots that I could simply not take with a regular phone. With the iPhone 7 Plus zoom, I can take the same shot with a regular phone, but the i7+ quality is a bit better. I wish that Apple had chosen to use an actual wide lens. In an ideal world, I’d love to have all three lenses, but the telephoto would not be my first choice. You may have a different usage model, so it’s up to you to decide. Bokeh effect (background blur) The second thing that the secondary lens brings is the ability to take photos with great background blurs. This is an effect called “Bokeh” (which means Blur in Japanese) and which is created by a combination of large lens surface and large aperture size (lower f-stop). The mobile phone lenses are too small for this phenomenon to happen optically but there are ways to produce a similar effect in software. "THE IPHONE 7 PLUS BOKEH IS BEAUTIFUL"The idea is: the farther you go away from the point of focus (in the depth axis), the blurrier things should get (more or less). The blurry area is called the Circle of Confusion and how blurry each pixel is can be calculated by looking at how far the pixel is from the camera. This distance can be computed from two photos taken with a slightly different position – that’s how Huawei did it on the Huawei P9 phone. The Bokeh effect isn’t identical to an optical Bokeh, but it works reasonably well. In this picture, both phones have created their bokeh effect instantaneously (no wait time). In my opinion, the iPhone 7 Plus bokeh is beautiful. However, there is a weird blur-bleeding (halo/fuzz) around the shoulders and head that should not be there. I have seen this kind of halo several times with the iPhone 7 Plus. How noticeable it is, depends on the scene. Most of the time, you only see it if you pay attention. Other times, it’s much more evident. The single-lens S7 Edge has cleaner edges around the subject, but a distinctly lower quality blur (The S7 photos is darker because the white balance was different, due to a larger coverage of the scene, sorry). I took a picture with a Sony NEX 6000 to show what kind of blur one gets with a compact cam. Notice the absence of “blur bleeding” around the subject. It’s not the best camera for bokeh, but it gets the point across. For single-lens phones, it is possible to produce beautiful bokeh photos using dedicated camera apps which do it by a software process that involves taking two pictures. Google’s version called Lens Blur is the best that I know of, but it’s much slower (~15-20 seconds of processing per photo) and not convenient for frequent use. It’s OK for a once in a while Bokeh shot. iPhone users have apps like Portrait Blur (app store link) and others. With dual-lenses cameras, it’s almost instantaneous. Overall camera experience: very good. Overall, the Camera experience of the iPhone is superb. The camera mostly does what the user would expect, and the white balance and color tuning are great. Obviously, it’s the best iPhone camera (especially the iPhone 7 Plus), but those who are willing to switch have great options. The Galaxy S7 still has better AF, low-light capabilities and display. The Google Pixel also has a better image quality, HDR, and video recording. The LG V20 has a unique wide-angle mode, which makes it a very particular camera. From an Apple user point of view, the iPhone 7/7+ camera is an exciting step up from the iPhone 6s. If budget is of no concern, you will be reasonably happy with the camera upgrade. Budget conscious 6s users may want to think twice before spending their money. iPhone 6 users who upgrade will get a good return for their money. Display: excellent The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus display have the same diagonal size and resolution as their iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus predecessors. Nothing new here. Relative to the Galaxy phones, here’s a quick list of display specs: iPhone 7: LCD IPS, 1334×750 (~1M pixels), 65.6% Screen/body ratio, 326 PPI iPhone 7+: LCD IPS, 1920×1080 (~2.073M pixels), 67.7% screen/body ratio, 401 PPI Galaxy S7: AMOLED, 2560×1440 (~3.686M pixels), 72.1% screen/body ratio, 576 PPI) Galaxy S7e: AMOLED, 2560×1440 (~3.686M pixels), 75.1% screen/body ratio, 576 PPI) Learn more: What is PPI? Learn more: High PPI displays: do you really need them? As you can see, the technical display specifications of the iPhone 7/7+ displays are very decent, but not particularly impressive. That said, the numbers themselves don’t completely do justice to the iPhone 7 screen. All LCD displays aren’t equal, and the iPhone 7 series has an upgraded LCD panel from the iPhone 6/6s. Its performance is derived from technologies used in the iPad Pro 9.7 with the support of two color gamuts, including the DCI-P3, which is 26% wider and used as the standard for 4K content. In short: colors are great. We measured brightness at 579 NITs on the iPhone 7 Plus panel, which is very bright for a smartphone (means that you can easily use it outdoors on a sunny day). For example, the Google Pixel XL hits (only) 343 NITs, and the Galaxy S7 Edge can output 558 NITs. Arguably, an LCD display can never have true blacks, and OLED technology still has some advantages, including flexibility, low-power potential, and even higher peak brightness. This is why Apple is likely to switch to OLED for the iPhone 8. Learn more: LCD vs. OLED. Which is Best And Why? Battery We often say that the best indicator for battery life is the battery capacity, within a given platform. Notice the “within a given platform”. Why? Because each OS (platform) might have significant power consumption profiles. Apple has always been a bit more friendly to lower capacity batteries, and it’s fair to say that they have done quite well with ridiculously small batteries in the past. The iPhone 7 has a 1960 mAh capacity, while the iPhone 7 Plus has a capacity of 2900 mAh. If you are not familiar with this metric, read our What is mAh article on the subject. As we mentioned in the Display section, the iPhone can have 3.6X fewer pixels as select Android competitors, and when Apple finally match Android phones for resolution+screen size, Apple will have to increase the battery size too. If you are looking at an Android phone with an FHD LCD display and a comparable size+brightness, then a direct comparison between capacity (in mAh) makes more sense. I would rather see Apple spend more on the battery size, and less on the main processor. Apple says that the iPhone 7 can last for “up to 2 hours more than the 6s”, but looking at the official site (i7, i6s), both have an estimated Talk Time of 14 hrs, both have an estimated stand-by time of 10 days. However, the “Internet browsing” is the item that has an estimated two additional hours on the iPhone 7. I’ll take it, but if that’s from browser optimization, it’s not the same as if it was from overall system optimizations. Software The iPhone currently runs on iOS 10.2, and in general Apple does an excellent job at upgrading the OS for most users. Hats-off to that. If you have an iPhone that is a few years old, you should still get timely updates with new features. This is one of the things where Apple does much better than Android (except for Google phones). If your phone is older than that, you might start having performance issues as the OS get bigger, and some apps will only work with the most recent OS, so skipping updates can only work for so long, and Apple and app developers make it quite hard not to upgrade since many important apps do require the latest OS version. Older phones going back to the iPhone 5 can receive the iOS 10 updrade, so the OS in itself isn’t a reason to buy the iPhone 7. You can read up on the ten most important features of iOS 10, but I would point out to: The faster camera launch by sliding to the left The QuickType keyboard that suggests adding contextual information to conversations The improved photo sorting, thanks for facial recognition and geo-localization The opening of Voice Calls to 3rd party services such as chat/voice apps System performance (best in class) The Apple A10 SoC is at the heart of the iPhone. This processor is the main unit controlling everything, and inside it, are a collection of sub units including ISPs (image processors), GPU (graphics processor) and a low-power sub-processor called M10. The A10 is a quad-core chip, where the A9 was a dual-core chip, but not all four cores are the same. The A10 has two cores dedicated to high-performance, and two to low-power efficiency (⅕ the power of the high-performance cores). Typically, users need high-performance 20% of the time, but they need as much as they can. 80% of the time, the phone is doing background tasks and should be optimized for low power. "AMAZING SINGLE CORE PERFORMANCE"Most mobile chip vendors use such a technique which is based or inspired by ARM’s big.LITTLE architecture which lets the OS transfer tasks to either set of processors — interestingly the transfer has a power cost, but overall there should be a net gain if done properly. Apparently, Apple never uses all four cores at the same time. Opinion: Are benchmarks relevant? What do they mean? The A10 is also known for its amazing peak single core performance. Single-core performance is crucial because 100% of apps use at least one core. Apps can easily be optimized for 2 cores and keep in mind that the OS and background services also run in the background, so using a few cores is common. It’s hard to find mobile apps that genuinely use 6-8 cores. Learn more: Are more CPU cores always better? iPhones usually offer a smooth user experience, an area where Android has a bad reputation, even if things got a lot better since. Interestingly, while I’m quite sensitive to UI smoothness and 60FPS user experience, many people aren’t. That said, the “smooth experience” also depends on how many apps you have. For exemple, we still have an iPhone 6 at the office, and while it used to be super-smooth when we first reviewed it, adding a lot of apps (and never removing them) has put some strain on the user experience. Apple has remained somewhat mysterious of the GPU configuration of the iPhone 7. Officially, the A10 has 50% more graphics performance as the A9, and it may very well be that Apple has purchased a PowerVR GT7600 cluster with 50% more graphics cores. Since Apple doesn’t mind paying for chip die size, this is a realistic possibility. In any case, this thing is fast. Conclusion: very good The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are very good phones even if their design isn’t something to brag about. As long as you like and it and feel good using one, it’s fine. They are a bit different in the sense that they don’t compete directly with the rest of the (Android) market for buyers who are already “locked-in” (or just “happy”) in the Apple ecosystem. Now we can reach a conclusion to the initial questions: 1/ Should I upgrade from my current iPhone? If you have an iPhone 6 or older, the iPhone 7 is a good upgrade. If you have an iPhone 6s, it’s not clear-cut, and the “bang for your buck” is not as great. I wouldn’t upgrade it if you ask me, especially since Apple is set to make a huge redesign with the iPhone 8 (read the iPhone 8 news). 2/ Should I choose the iPhone 7 or 7 Plus? When it comes to choosing between the two new iPhones, choose by the size, pick the one that feels better in your hand (and pocket?). It’s nice to have a large battery, but I would argue that if you like the smaller iPhone better, then that should be a priority. Thanks to rapid-charging, there are ways to mitigate the battery-life challenges. You will have to decide which has the higher priority. The iPhone 7 Plus also has a secondary camera which is capable of a 2X zoom without quality loss. If you tend to zoom a lot, then it might be a something to take into consideration. I dont zoom much, so I would not want to pay extra for it. As for the “bokeh” effect, I believe that people will use it rarely because it’s a “special mode” (Portrait Mode) and not something that is automatically turned on at the most appropriate moment. 3/ iPhone 7 or Android competitor? In general, the choice between iPhone or Android should never be imposed by “specs” or specific technical features, unless you are very familiar with both platforms.You have to make sure that you have all the apps you like, and that the general experience is satisfactory to YOU. If you are happy with one platform, it’s understandably convenient to stick to it. The OS is the most important choice for any phone or computer purchase. OS aside, and from a hardware perspective, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus have a single distinct advantage: the faster peak performance. The thing is: it’s not *that* visible during regular usage unless you play video games often. The iPhone 7/7 Plus camera isn’t “the best” even if it is very good. The Galaxy S7 and Pixel are superior in image quality, and the LG V20 is in a category of its own. Finally, if you are still on the fence between Android and iPhone, wait until the LG G6 (check the LG G6 news), and the Galaxy S8 (check the Galaxy S8 news) have been announced, because the rumors do look fascinating.

By Deepika Rajani Friday, January 27, 2017 After an argument with Leanne Battersby over the way he acted towards Liz McDonald when she gave Leanne the cot that was meant for Ruiari, Nick Tilsley stormed out of their home and to the Bistro. Once he got there, he opened up a search engine on his laptop and typed in "Edinburgh". While some fans questioned why he was interested in the Scottish city, many were more interested in the name of the search engine and its similarities to the well known search engine Google. "@itvcorrie is Voggle real?," wrote one.

As the episode came to an end, Nick Tilsley, played by Ben Price, explained to Toyah Battersby why he was interested in Edinburgh. Nick revealed that he was planning on moving Leanne and Simon up north for a "new start" away from Steve McDonald and Peter Barlow. The Bistro owner's plans to move to Scotland comes after the confirmation that the actor has quit the soap.

Google is one of the biggest technology companies in the world, with more than 57,000 employees worldwide, many of them located in its Silicon Valley headquarters. Those people and their workspace have a big impact on the local environment, which is why Google has been taking a new, holistic approach to preserving and protecting it. Google’s workplace and services group launched its Ecology Program back in 2014 and since then it’s taken some big steps to manage its impact on the environment. Breaking down these approaches and initiatives in a new story on the company’s blog, Google explains how it looks to bring some of its healthy and sustainable indoor developments to the wider natural world. But of course, this being Google, while its initiatives are grounded in sound, traditional knowledge, it also uses data-driven strategies to augment existing know-how. It’s looked to develop habitats that can withstand climate change, are tolerant of adverse weather conditions like drought and support pollinators like birds and bees. More: Google is saving the environment, one renovated coal plant at a time Google’s Green loop is a cycle track that travels around and through its campuses, crosses between green spaces and shops and cafes, which is accessible to both Google employees and the general public. It is augmented by the Charleston Retention Basin, an on-campus nature reserve that features water courses and large areas of packed greenery. It is worth pointing out, however, that as altruistic as Google’s projects sound, not everyone has agreed with them in the past. When Google wanted to build several accessibility bridges within the basin in 2015/2016, a number of local residents complained that it would disturb local wildlife. Google contends that the move allowed more local residents to enjoy the wildlife, as well as acting as an added convenience for Google workers. Much of what Google discusses in its holistic approach to environmental care, is that what it’s doing is for everyone. Its approach looks to improve the environment for individuals, those on campus, as well as regional and global residents. It hopes to achieve this through innovative designs, working with environmental groups and encouraging new restoration efforts around the world. “We see great potential to transform our local and regional landscapes through engagement and collaboration,” it said in a statement. “While ecology and tech may not be obvious partners, science, data-driven analysis, and transparency are the pillars that will guide meaningful and lasting change in the outdoor environments that we and so many others call home.” Share

A Cisco-Apple partnership announced in 2015 gives iOS devices capabilities that other wireless clients don’t have on Cisco-based enterprise networks. Among other things, enterprises can designate work-related applications like videoconferencing for priority on the wireless link between iOS devices and a Wi-Fi access point. The partnership will also make it a little easier for Apple fans to work with the Spark Board all-in-one meeting device that Cisco announced on Tuesday. Android doesn’t have those advantages. It’s not that Android devices don’t work at all with Cisco networks or the Spark Board: Most Spark Board interactions are possible on Android through things like public APIs. But things might have gone a different way. “We started with Android,” said Rowan Trollope, Cisco’s senior vice president of IoT and applications, in a press briefing after Tuesday’s launch. When Trollope and Cisco collaboration guru Jonathan Rosenberg went to Google to propose ways to help Android devices work better on Cisco networks, the company was enthusiastic, he said. But because so many players, including carriers and phone manufacturers, can craft their own variations on Android, Google couldn’t hash out integrations with Cisco on its own, Trollope said. “We like your ideas,” he recalled Google saying. “Go talk to Samsung and HTC and, oh yes, you have to go to Verizon, too.” Some Android users decry the modifications that device companies and carriers make to Google’s open-source OS, which they say can hobble important features. In addition, vendors and service providers usually upgrade users' phones to the next release of Android only after long delays, or don’t offer upgrades at all. Apple fully controls iOS and offers new releases to all users at the same time, though older devices can’t necessarily run the latest version. Cisco did approach Samsung, the biggest manufacturer of Android products, but that still left a lot more vendors to deal with. “One by one by one,” Trollope said. “We don’t have the resources to do that.” Mobile operators might not even want to give their versions of Android all the capabilities that Apple developed with Cisco, he added. For example, the Cisco-Apple integration helps enterprises shift voice calls from the carrier network to a wireless LAN without losing things like call logging for compliance. “It’s not necessarily in the operator’s best interest,” Trollope said. “Apple can do it, and Apple did do it.” Google did not respond to a request for comment. A Samsung representative declined to comment. 6 Styles of Customer Analytics More from Gartner Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

Google Launches Its Own Root Certificate Authority GO The company takes another step on the road to independence Jan 27, 2017 20:14 GMT  ·  By Gabriela Vatu  ·  Share:  Google is starting a new chapter of its road to independence as it announced the launch of its own root certificate authority. This new move will make sure Google will stop relying on intermediate certificate authorities, GIAG2 in their case, issued by a third party. The company has been working on rolling out HTTPS across its products and services, and it seems it seeks a speedier method to do so and more control over the matter. “As we look forward to the evolution of both the web and our own products it is clear HTTPS will continue to be a foundational technology. This is why we have made the decision to expand our current Certificate Authority efforts to include the operation of our own Root Certificate Authority,” writes Ryan Hurst, product manager at Google. This is how Google Trust Services was born, an entity that will operate these Certificate Authorities on behalf of Google and Alphabet, their parent company. This entire process will take time, however. Embedding root certificates into products and waiting for the associated versions of those products to be broadly deployed can take time. Therefore, Google has acquired two existing Root Certificate Authorities - GlobalSign R2 and R4 - which will enable the company to begin issuing independent certificates in a speedy manner. Google Trust Services now operates these Root Certificates Old certificates to continue working Google wants to continue the operation of their existing GIAG2 subordinate Certificate Authority for the time being. “If you are building products that intend to connect to a Google property moving forward you need to at minimum include the above Root Certificates. With that said even though we now operate our own roots, we may still choose to operate subordinate CAs under third-party operated roots. If you are building products that intend to connect to a Google property moving forward you need to at minimum include the above Root Certificates. With that said even though we now operate our own roots, we may still choose to operate subordinate CAs under third-party operated roots,” Hurst adds. Google advises developers seeking to connect to Google property to include a wide set of trusty roots in their products.

According to Space.com, an experiment designed to test the viability of yeast on the moon was short-listed in a 25-team competition promoting sustainable life on the moon. The winning team would have their prototype launch with a rover sent into space by TeamIndus, an Indian team of researchers participating in the Google Lunar XPrize. MORE: Here's Why Whiskey and Outer Space Don’t Mix The Google Lunar XPrize in an international competition with a $30 million prize purse requiring participants to race to the moon, or more specifically, build, launch and land a spacecraft on the moon’s surface; travel 500 meters; and transmit high-definition video and images back to earth. The first team to do so wins a grand prize of $20 million. Currently, five teams are confirmed to compete for the prize: TeamIndus, from India; SpaceIL, of Israel; Moon Express, from the U.S.; Synergy Moon, an international team; and Hakuto, representing Japan. ALSO: Meet the Woman Who's Making Sure Your Beer Tastes Good In addition to vying for the Google Lunar XPrize, TeamIndus decided to hold their own competition, Lab2Moon, inviting researchers under 25 years of age to conceptualize, design, and construct an experiment that could theoretically help humankind develop a sustainable settlement on the moon. Enter a group of University of California San Diego (UCSD) Jacobs School of Engineering students, who also happen to make up the UCSD Astrobiology Club — Johnny Koo, Jared Buchanan, Han Lu Ling, Neeki Ashari, Srivaths Kalyan, and Tavish Traut — whose collective appreciation for astrobiology and homebrewing got them thinking about yeast’s potential applications in a moon society, not the least of which is, you guessed it, brewing beer. (Other lesser uses include making bread, other foods, and pharmaceuticals.) Between their Lab2Moon team name, “Original Gravity” — a brewing term referring to the amount of sugar suspended in wort, the boiled liquid that will become beer after fermentation — and their project name, “ALEiens!,” we think they earned the spot on that rover already. “The idea started out with a few laughs amongst a group of friends,” said Neeki Ashari, who is a fifth-year bioengineering student as well as Original Gravity’s PR & operations lead. “We all appreciate the craft of beer, and some of us own our own homebrewing kits. When we heard that there was an opportunity to design an experiment that would go up on India’s moonlander, we thought we could combine our hobby with the competition by focusing on the viability of yeast in outer space.” Original Gravity designed a device that they believe could “brew” beer on the moon (technically, the wort would be made beforehand, so only the fermentation part of the process would actually take place on the moon), sent TeamIndus their statement and this video explaining the process, and were selected as one of 25 final teams eligible to move on to phase two. A total of 3,000 applicants from more than 300 cities in 15 countries around the world were considered. For phase two, Original Gravity and 24 other teams, whose projects span topics from radiation-shielding bacteria to a lunar gene bank for endangered species, will present prototypes of their concepts to an international jury of experts in Bangalore, India, in March. The winning team will join TeamIndus in launching their project into space on December 28, 2017.

Name: Subject: Message: 7 things the Google Play Store does better than the Apple App Store Featuresby Dane O'Leary13 hours ago 15 1500 17 Android or iOS? It’s one of the modern era’s greatest unanswered questions and a point of momentous contention for fanboys on both sides of the fence for thousands of years. Or maybe just the past decade. There are valid arguments that can be made for both sides: Clearly, Apple created a mobile operating system that is incredibly smooth, snappy, and clean. Then again, Android has gotten quite good — Dare I say it? Even attractive — and powers a mind-bogglingly diverse selection of devices. But I’m not here to goad the cries of fanboys the world over. Instead, I’m tackling a much simpler — albeit no less loaded — question. In a feeble attempt to minimize the wrath of followers of Apple fans everywhere, I will address this question as objectively as I can. That question is… In what ways is the Google Play Store better than the Apple App Store? Google Play Store is more developer-friendly From the very beginning, Apple has been extremely (and, for developers, frustratingly) selective about the apps that are allowed on the Apple App Store. The reason for being so selective was basically for quality assurance. Sure enough, iOS apps have surely gained a reputation for working well and being quite polished. As just a single example, Snapchat for iOS is infamously better than the Android version. This reputation for quality has occasionally resulted in certain developers developing iOS apps either exclusively or first; the latter has been the case with the highly-anticipated Super Mario Run, released for iOS in December and yet to be released for Android. For developers, there much less risk that you’ll spend thousands and thousands of hours on development just to have your app denied for inclusion on the Google Play Store. While there’s something to be said for making sure your users get only the best-quality apps, there’s certainly a downside. For app developers, there much less risk that you’ll spend thousands and thousands of hours on app development just to have your app denied for inclusion on the Google Play Store. This has also led to a much more vibrant development community for Android apps. This is not to say there’s a shortage of apps for iOS. Users of both platforms have more than their fair share of apps at their disposal. Perusing the Google Play Store, you’ll find a wide variety of interesting and creative apps. For starters, there are many powerful launchers available with which you can totally change the look of Android, and that’s something you won’t find on the Apple App Store. Then there are apps like Tasker that open up a world of possibilities for automating tasks and processes on Android devices. Granted, not all the apps submitted to the Google Play Store are winners; however, with things like Google Home and Android Auto, it’s not a bad idea to encourage and support innovation in mobile software rather than to homogenize it. Google Play apps are more discoverable Here’s something that you may not have known about the Google Play and Apple App Stores: when you search for an app, you’re somewhat more likely to find what you’re looking for in the Google Play Store than the Apple App Store. Let me explain why. The Google Play Store runs your search queries through basically all the textual information available on an app’s page. For example, you could search the Play Store using a series of keywords or a phrase and the Play Store would scan even the descriptions of apps to find ones that most closely resemble your query. By comparison, the Apple App Store compares your query against the keywords that developers manually enter into a keyword section, which exists specifically for this purpose. This isn’t a problem if your query happens to be one of the keywords for your desired app, but if you’re searching something that’s a bit more specific, you may have a harder time finding the iOS app that fits your needs. Of course, the fact that the Google Play Store has more robust search capabilities probably shouldn’t come as much of a surprise as Google is… you know, Google. See also: Google testing new search suggestions for Play Store apps December 12, 2016 Google Play has the ‘social factor’ Historically, downloading and using apps was something we did individually. We found apps on our own, decided whether to download them on our own and used them on our own. Over time, though, finding and using apps has become more social, at least on the Google Play Store. The Google Play Store has become increasingly social. Seeing who in your network uses an app is like getting personal recommendations from your friends. When you pull up an app’s page in the Google Play Store, certain information is front-and-center. You’ll easily spot the app’s cumulative rating as well as if any of your friends use and recommend the app. If you scroll down a bit, you’ll find commentary that’s been left by your friends and other users. You can filter that commentary so that you’re seeing only those comments by users who use your same device or who are using the most recent version of that app. In effect, it makes discovering and choosing apps a more social experience. Considering that many apps — particularly games — can connect you with other app users, even using apps has become a more social experience. By comparison, finding apps on the Apple App Store is a more solitary experience. There are app reviews, but they’re not front-and-center like on the Google Play Store. Perhaps this is due to the assumption that iOS apps are of a higher quality or because it encourages users to choose apps based on those apps’ merits rather than the opinions of others. However, seeing who in your network uses an app is like getting personal recommendations from your friends. This is useful if, for instance, you’re looking for a new game to download to keep you occupied on a flight or long car ride. Android apps are less expensive To a degree, the higher price of iOS apps is a statement on how much harder it is for developers to get their apps on the Apple App Store versus the more laid-back Google Play Store. If you run a search query on the Play Store for “to-do list”, the number of results you’ll get borders on obscene. Of course, there are the popular ones like Todoist, Wunderlist, and Any.do, but there are hundreds — if not thousands — of others since virtually anyone with the know-how can have their apps available on the Google Play Store. And for this very reason, they’re free to download. Clearly, there’s more competition on the Google Play Store, which is why Android apps tend to either be cheaper or free. Think about it this way: Maybe you’ve made a really great app that many would consider worth its cost, but since there are dozen other apps that offer similar functionality and comparable quality, users are likely to make do with one that’s free. In this case, such competition among apps in the Google Play Store works to the user’s advantages because it makes apps cheaper. Meanwhile, the Apple App Store is more selective about the apps that are accepted; with less competition, developers are able to charge more for the apps because there aren’t as many alternatives. On the development side, developers are better able to monetize their iOS apps without having to riddle them with ads, which has been the downfall of many a promising app in the Google Play Store. So there’s a give-and-take relationship between app cost and the ease with which developers can have their apps included on the Google Play and Apple App Stores. But if you’re someone who doesn’t want to pay for apps — and paying for premium apps surely gets expensive over time — you’re probably better off with Android. See also: How to get a refund for apps purchased from the Google Play Store December 26, 2016 Google Play has a more robust web interface In many ways, the Google Play and Apple App Stores are two sides of the same coin, far more alike than they are different. If you’re an iOS user, you’d surely have no problem picking up an Android, opening the Play Store, and downloading the app of your choosing; the same goes for an Android user with an iPhone. However, a key functional difference between these two app markets becomes apparent when you try to use them via the web browser of a PC or laptop. Pushing app installs to your various Android tablets or phones from the web is much simpler than having to find the app on each device individually. At a glance, much of the same information is available in both places; you can see an app’s name, icon, and a general description displayed prominently on both the Google Play and Apple App Stores. You’ll probably even spot the same screenshots, too. But while the Google Play Store gives you the option to install an app to your Android smartphone or tablet from right there on your web browser, you’ll have to navigate to the app on the Apple App Store on each of your iOS devices in order to actually install it. Being able to install apps on your mobile devices from the web browser on your PC (or Mac) may not seem like a life-changing convenience if you’re an iOS user, but I’d wager that many Android users have grown to really appreciate this Google Play feature. The most obvious use case would be when you click on a link to an app while you’re browsing the web on your desktop; rather than having to track it down on your phone, you can use the web interface of the Google Play Store to have the app installed and waiting for you on your device the next time you pick it up. Pretty neat, right? Google Play provides superior information It might seem odd to say that the Google Play Store offers more info than the Apple App Store after having just said that both app markets offer virtually the same information. That’s still true, but the Google Play Store tends to show a bit more and have that info organized a little better. On the Apple App Store, the only way to experience an app before you download it is via the provided screenshots. The Google Play Store provides screenshots, too, but oftentimes with an accompanying video. Said video can be a commercial made by the app’s developer or a brief recording of the app being used; however, in either case, the video is much better at giving you an idea of what you can expect from the app and even how the app is used. Information also seems to be a bit more organized and easier to read on the Google Play Store. The best way to see this difference is to navigate to an app on both the Google Play and Apple App Stores in separate browser tabs on your PC and compare. You’ll notice that an app’s profile on the Play Store is very linear; the identifying info is at the very top, followed by the “Install” button and the video and/or screenshots. Beneath that, you’ll find the app’s textual information, followed by user reviews and some final details at the bottom, including who developed the app, compatibility info, and when the app was last updated. With the Play Store, everything is in a neat, vertical line, but on the Apple App Store, an app’s information is separated into two columns, a small column on the left and a larger column to the right. Rather than only scrolling up and down to find the info you need, your eyes are darting from side to side, too. And then there’s the fact that an app’s cumulative rating is separated from actual user reviews on the Apple App Store whereas they are a single section in the Play Store. Of course, everyone has his or her own preferences. You might find the double-column layout of the Apple App Store to be more efficient; however, I’d say the simpler organization and ease of navigation of an app’s profile on the Google Play Store is a noteworthy advantage. Google Play apps have broader device compatibility Last but not least, there’s the issue of compatibility, which is decidedly less of an issue for the Google Play Store. As you may be aware, Android OS powers both Google’s smartphones and tablets. Likewise, both iPhones and iPads run iOS. In theory, you might expect this to mean that both the smartphones and tablets on each platform would be able to run the same apps. While this is largely the case for Google, it’s a bit more complicated for iOS devices The entire Google Play Store is your oyster whether you have an Android smartphone or a tablet. Unfortunately, iPad users are a bit more limited.Although many of the staple iOS apps are available for both iPads and iPhones, the ability for an iPad to run an app is contingent on that app having been adapted for use on the iPad’s larger display. However, this isn’t an issue for Android. When you download an app on your Android tablet, one of three things could happen, depending on the app in question and the version of Android your tablet is running. The app will either have been made to be used on both smartphones and tablets (which is the most likely scenario at this point), be automatically scaled-up to fit the larger display, or the app will operate within a smartphone-sized window at the center of the tablet’s display. The vast majority of Android apps are designed for use on both smartphones and tablets rather than one or the other. In short, the entire Google Play Store is your oyster whether you have an Android smartphone or a tablet. Unfortunately, iPad users are a bit more limited, at least for the time being.

Likewise, even the Google Play Store has its weaknesses. The purpose of this article was not to declare one a winner over the other. Instead, my intent was to merely identify some of the chief differences between the Google Play and Apple App Stores, particularly when it comes to Google’s strengths. But now I’d like to hear from you. Do you agree or disagree with the characteristics I identified as the Google Play Store’s greatest strengths? Do you feel the Google Play Store is actually better than the Apple App Store? If you think the Apple App Store is better overall, why? Leave your thoughts in the comment section below.

(Images via Google, Amazon, BigStock). Amazon is still reaping the benefits of its early lead in home voice technology, thanks to its Echo smart speaker and Alexa virtual assistant. But that doesn’t mean the race is over, asserted Google CEO Sundar Pichai during Alphabet’s fourth-quarter earnings call Thursday. Mark Mahaney, an RBC Analyst, asked Pichai if he was concerned that sales of the Google Home were trailing behind the competition. Pichai pointed out that Google Home, the first real competitor for the Echo, has only been on the market since November. Google CEO Sundar Pichai. (Google Photo) “We just launched it in Q4,” said Pichai. “We had a very strong quarter there and we are going to invest a lot in it over 2017. It’s very early days. When I look at what it would take to do voice search well, our years of progress … in areas like natural language processing come into play and I think there’s a lot of work ahead to make all of this work well for users. This is a core area we have invested in for the very long term. So I feel very comfortable about how this will play out in the future.” As connected devices, appliances, and security systems become increasingly mainstream, Google and Amazon have emerged as chief competitors for the voice operating system of the home. Mahaney asked whether Google’s slow start could be problematic down-the-line. Pichai reiterated that it’s much too early to call this race and stressed that Google sees voice as just one component of a larger overall goal. “It’s a really natural way for users to interact,” said Pichai. “We think it’ll be one mode. Users will have many different ways by which they interact with computing. And for voice, as you pointed out, we expect voice to work across many different contexts so we are thinking about it across phones, homes, TVs, cars, and trying to drive that ecosystem that way. We want Google to be there for users when they need it.” When Google Home launched, reviewers noted that Google’s massive search capabilities give its assistant a wider knowledge base to tap for queries. But they found Alexa to be more useful for integration with third-party apps, since developers have had nearly two years to create new capabilities using the Alexa Skills Kit. Google opened up a developer platform, called Actions on Google, for its assistant in December. “We think of this as an end-to-end thing,” said Pichai. “All of this means users engage more with us, more with computing, and look for more information and I think the trends we see are positive. We think about it from a long-term perspective. So I see more opportunity than challenge, when I think about voice search.” Previously: More than 8M people own an Amazon Echo as customer awareness increases ‘dramatically’ Monica Nickelsburg handles a variety of editorial roles, including social media, site production, and the Geek Life beat.

People under 24 years of age spend even more time online. Where do the data we share online go? How long are they stored and who can access them? Private companies, hackers, governments? And for what purpose? There is of course a legal framework to protect online privacy in Europe, and new and improved regulations will be applied from May 2018 to guarantee people’s personal information is protected no matter where it is sent, processed or stored,even outside the EU. How a Spanish man took on Google over privacy concerns and won Another landmark improvement will be the right to be forgotten. You will have the right to ask internet companies to delete inaccurate or obsolete content about you. This particular right we owe to a Spanish citizen who relentlessly battled the US giant Google over damaging personal information that kept popping up on the search engine. Our reporter Hans Von der Brelie met the brave Spaniard. The ‘Snoopers’ Charter’: Assessing Britain’s new mass surveillance powers Not everything is fine and dandy when it comes to online privacy in Europe. Increasingly hit or threatened by terrorism, European governments have toughened their surveillance laws. Fourteen nations – among them France, the UK, Germany and Poland – have been singled out by Amnesty international for allowing the mass interception of – and possible access to – data of millions of people. Our reporter Valerie Gauriat travelled to the UK where a law with sweeping surveillance powers came into force late last year drawing a strong rebuke from The European Court of Justice.

Join For Free gRPC is a high-performance, open source, general RPC framework that puts mobile and HTTP/2 first. gRPC is based on many years of Google’s experience in building distributed systems — it is designed to be low latency and bandwidth- and CPU-efficient to create massively distributed systems that span data centers as well as power mobile apps, real-time communications, IoT devices, and APIs. It’s also interoperable among multiple languages. But beyond the fact that it’s more efficient than REST, we’ll look into how to use gRPC’s streaming API, where you can establish server-side streaming, client-side streaming, and bidirectional streaming! This allows developers to build sophisticated real-time applications with ease. In addition to learning about gRPC and HTTP/2 concepts with code and demonstrations, we’ll also deep dive into integration with existing build systems such as Maven and Gradle, but also frameworks such as Spring Boot and RxJava. We'll tackle: Writing/using a Spring Boot starter to run a gRPC server. Configuring projects to generate gRPC stub code. Integrating w/ RxJava’s observable sequences, which matches very well with gRPC’s Stream Observable constructs.

Microsoft Corp. topped quarterly growth projections on the strength of rising customer sign-ups for its cloud offerings, such as Azure, which saw revenue almost double. (Swayne B. Hall / Associated Press) By Alistair Barr and Jillian Ward Bloomberg Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS Alphabet Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Intel Corp., which all posted quarterly results Thursday, reinforced what’s become a truism in technology: the biggest growth is in businesses that deliver computing over the internet. Microsoft topped projections on the strength of rising customer sign-ups for its cloud offerings like Azure, which saw revenue almost double. Intel sales rose more than expected, helped by orders for processors that power data-center servers – the machines at the heart of cloud computing. While profit at Google parent Alphabet disappointed, the numbers also signaled that heavy spending to catch cloud leaders Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft is paying off. Google’s Other Revenue line, which includes cloud computing, jumped 62 percent to $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter. “Our cloud business is on a terrific upswing,” Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said Thursday during a conference call with analysts. “I definitely think we’re going to have a great year.” What started a decade ago as an easy way for startups to run websites has turned into an increasingly popular way for companies of all sizes to access the software needed to run their operations. Many big technology companies are in a strong position to provide this because they already have huge data centers to support their own web services. More than $1 trillion in IT spending will be directly or indirectly affected by the shift to cloud during the next five years, Gartner estimated in July. “This will make cloud computing one of the most disruptive forces of IT spending since the early days of the digital age,” the research firm said at the time. Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella has been working to reposition the company around such internet services. In addition to robust demand for Azure, consumers and corporations continue to purchase Office 365, a cloud-based version of the company’s productivity software that includes Word and Excel. Almost 25 million consumers are now subscribed to Office 365, Microsoft said, and sales increased 47 percent in the fiscal second quarter. “As long as cloud is growing, people are happy,” said Mark Moerdler, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., who rates Microsoft shares outperform. “If margins are growing, people are even happier.” Redmond-based Microsoft has been spending on data centers and adding products to win new cloud customers. Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said in July that gross margins, a measure of profitability, for the commercial cloud business would “materially improve” in the current year. That’s because previous years of investment are starting to pay off as those data centers support more customers. Microsoft has pledged to reach annualized revenue of $20 billion in its corporate cloud business by the fiscal year that ends in June 2018. That metric stood at more than $14 billion at the end of the second quarter. Intel’s fourth-quarter sales of server chips to cloud service providers jumped 30 percent from a year earlier. Offsetting that, companies and government agencies spent 7 percent less than they had in the same quarter in 2016 on equipping their in-house computer rooms, the company said. “It’s moving to the public cloud, it’s moving to those areas at a faster rate than I think we expected,” Intel Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich said on a conference call. Amazon reports earnings next week and analysts at RBC Capital Markets expect the company’s AWS cloud business to generate $3.6 billion in fourth-quarter revenue, up 50 percent from a year earlier. “Microsoft is the plumbing in the cloud,” Moerdler said. “Amazon is much bigger, but still Amazon and Microsoft are pulling away from the pack.” Updated: Jan. 27, 2017, 6:18 p.m.  Tags: Alphabet, amazon.com, Azure, “cloud” computing, Google, Intel, internet, microsoft, Other Revenue, Technology Click here to comment on this story » ​ Follow the Spokesman wherever you are: Facebook Twitter Newsletter Subscribe Print edition home delivery Newspaper Routes Available Help Customer Service Sitemap Directory Subscriber Services Classifieds Classifieds Advertising Obituaries More Masthead Staff Cowles Jobs Archives/Research Buy photo reprints Jumble Crossword Horoscopes Contact Us Downtown Spokane 999 W Riverside Ave Spokane, Wa 99201 Mailing Address P.O.

Credit: Paul Goguen/Bloomberg Most Popular It's hard to quibble with the continued success of Google's advertising business. Already the dominant company in the $200 billion annual market for web and mobile commercials, Google parent company Alphabet Inc. padded its advertising revenue by about $12 billion from 2015 to 2016. That means in a single year, Google found new business that was equivalent to half of Facebook's total yearly sales. But there is a potentially dark cloud in Google's sunny skies. Google's advertising empire has two parts. About 70% of Alphabet's total revenue last year came from the ads that the company sells on its own digital properties, including Google web search pages, YouTube, Gmail, Google Maps and more. The rest of Google's advertising revenue comes from the company's role as a middleman for ads all over the web and mobile devices. For example, the company might help Nike find people who are likely to buy its shoes, based on Google's stockpile of information on what people browse and do online. Then Google can pitch them ads for Nike in many spots they roam on the web. Google also has technology that helps owners of websites auction off ad spots. Related Stories Google's Mobile Search Revenue Grows, and Suggests Higher Mobile Ad Rates Ahead What Google calls its "network" business is lagging behind the incredible growth of Google's ad sales on its own digital hangouts. Revenue from the ad network rose 4% in 2016, while ad sales on Google's websites and apps rose 22%. The slower growth of Google's ad network means it is accounting for a smaller and smaller share of the company's total sales. In the fourth quarter of 2016, Google's advertising network generated 17% of Alphabet's total revenue, down from 22% three years earlier. The reasons for this are complicated. Digital advertising is changing. More ad sales are entirely computerized, pushing down the average prices for each ad and pinching Google's growth in its advertising network. The digital advertising business is growing more concentrated; a larger share of industry revenue is coming from ads sold on the websites and apps controlled by two companies, Google and Facebook. Smaller advertising players and ad networks are losing ground. Right now, the soft spot in Google's advertising network sales is no big deal. It's good, actually. Google is more than making up the difference with prodigious growth in ad sales on its own websites, which generally have higher prices and are more profitable for Google than the ads for which the company acts as a middleman. But allow me to wallow a bit in Google's worst-case scenario: It could turn into Yahoo. This is every internet company's worst fear. Yahoo in its heyday had the most popular hangouts on the web, including its homepage. And it had at the time the leading technology for serving up banner ads to the millions of people who used Yahoo as the front door to the internet. Then, Yahoo's internet stardom faded. And its technology didn't keep pace with changes in online advertising. The combination of failures meant dependence on ad sales from its own websites proved painful as those internet visitors moved to other sites and to their smartphones. That's not to say Google will follow Yahoo's path to internet ignominy. Google is the best internet ad machine ever created, with the best technology to harness untold reams of information about people's habits to feed into it. But the relatively slow growth of Google's advertising machine away from its own digital walls does leave the company potentially vulnerable. If search, YouTube, Google Maps and other company properties fade in popularity, then Google will have fewer digital billboard spots to apply its advertising prowess. Technology changes quickly and can turn today's internet stars into tomorrow's internet losers. Google's advertising strength in its web homes could someday become its dystopian nightmare. -- Shira Ovide at Bloomberg News In this article: Ad Tech DigitalNext Online Publishing Search Become a Member Register Now Renew Membership Benefits Datacenter Advertising Age     Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Instagram YouTube Tumblr Copyright © 1994-2017 Crain Communications Privacy Statement Terms of Use About Us Advertise Reprints Contact Us AD AGE Creativity LookBook Datacenter Resources Events Jobs On Campus Site by AREA 17

"Following" : "Follow"}} January 27, 2017 2:53pm   Comments Share: Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) reported an earnings miss, despite better-than-expected revenue, as a mysterious cost of goods sold expense weighed on the margins. But, Wall Street’s bullish long-term view on the stock remains largely unchanged. There are reasons for Street’s strong conviction on Alphabet's prospects as the company has delivered 28 straight quarters (seven years) of 20 percent-ish organic revenue growth. By any yardstick, this is not a mean feat. Further, it has lot of growth drivers in the form of enhanced search capabilities, YouTube, Google Play and cloud. RBC's Take “Google was growing approx. 20 percent on a $26 billion revenue run rate biz at the beginning of ‘10 and is now growing 20 percent on a $104 billion run rate biz. Very rare. Mobile, YouTube, Programmatic, Google Play and Cloud are all likely to help sustain growth,” RBC Capital analyst Mark Mahaney wrote in a note. Mahaney reiterated his Outperform rating and $1,025 price target on Alphabet shares. Other Voices From The Street Similarly, Credit Suisse too maintained its Outperform rating and $1,100 price target, saying “GOOGL shares in our view continue to exhibit the best risk/return among the large cap Internet stocks.” Analyst Stephen Ju based his bullish thesis on potential monetization improvements in Search, higher contributions from YouTube, Play and cloud, and value creation from Maps and Waymo. Meanwhile, Lloyd Walmsley of Deutsche Bank came away upbeat from Alphabet’s earnings, citing solid two-year growth trends in Google sites revenue. Walmsley also noted EBITDA margins were better than he expected. The analyst reiterated his Buy rating and upped his target price to $1,100 from $1,090. At the same time, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Youssef Squali said Alphabet delivered another strong quarter, reflecting solid advertiser demand for the company’s mobile search, Youtube and programmatic products. “With mobile search, display, cloud and hardware having a long runway ahead still, we believe Alphabet remains one of the key beneficiaries of growth in the digital economy, said Squali, who reiterated his Overweight rating and $1,040 price target. Nomura’s Anthony DiClemente too is positive on Alphabet’s continued strong growth coupled with disciplined cost management. As such, apart from maintaining a Buy rating and $950 target price, the analyst raised his FY 2017 EPS estimate to $42.67 from $41.56. At last check, shares of Alphabet were down 0.82 percent to $849.91 after setting a new 52-week high of $867.

Alphabet Inc., the parent company of Google, reports earnings Thursday, Jan. 26, 2017. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — The Pixel phone, Google's answer to Apple's iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy, is off to a promising start — but might have done even better had Google managed consumer demand as smartly as the device's sleek design. Although Google hasn't released sales figures, industry researchers say the Pixel has been a hot item since its October debut was greeted with mostly glowing reviews and the biggest marketing blitz in Google's 18-year history. But there were missed opportunities. Story continues below video × Advertisement Google didn't have enough Pixels available to meet demand. Rather than wait several weeks, many consumers interested in the Pixel probably bought an iPhone, Galaxy or another phone instead. And these people aren't likely to need a phone replacement for another year or two. Google also struck a deal to sell it through just one wireless carrier, Verizon. Although Google's online store sold Pixels compatible with other wireless networks, most people don't shop for phones that way. Of course, it's a moot point if there weren't enough Pixels to sell, but Google likely would have produced more if it had distribution deals with other carriers. It's not surprising that Google misjudged the market, given that this is the search company's first stab at making its own phone. Previously, it partnered with various manufacturers on a Nexus line of phones to showcase its Android operating system, but that effort barely made a dent. "This was probably a really good learning experience for them," says Neil Doshi, an analyst with Mizhuo Securities USA. The Pixel's success is important to Google because it wants to ensure there's a stylish Android phone to compete with the iPhone and drive more affluent consumers to its search engine, maps, YouTube videos and other services. Samsung's Galaxy and other phones also run on Android, but those devices have been de-emphasizing Google's services. Google, which is based in Mountain View, California, can afford to make some mistakes as it tries to establish the Pixel because its internet search and advertising network brings in so much revenue. Alphabet, Google's corporate parent, provided another reminder of its financial might with Thursday's release of its fourth-quarter earnings. The company earned $5.3 billion on revenue of $26 billion during the final three months of last year. Even after subtracting commissions paid to Google's ad partners, Alphabet's revenue totaled $21 billion — a 23 percent increase from a year earlier. The company's profit rose 8 percent from the prior year. Although Pixel sales weren't disclosed, the numbers provided a clue on how the phone did. Google's "other revenue" segment, which covers all sales outside of advertising, generated $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter, a 62 percent increase from the same time last year. Some of those gains came from sales of Google's new internet-connected speaker, Home, and its business software services, but Doshi believes most of the increase was generated by the Pixel. He estimates Google sold 1 million to 1.5 million Pixels during the fourth quarter. That's still just a sliver of the estimated 77 million that Apple sold during the same period (Apple is scheduled to release its numbers Tuesday). Pixel sales are also well below the roughly 15 million Galaxy S7 that Samsung sold during that device's first quarter on the market. Still, analysts say the Pixel did exceptionally well for a new phone with little brand recognition. "Without question, Google has a hit on its hands and is building a platform for success," says Jeff Moore, principal of Wave7 Research. Wave7 estimates that Pixel accounted for 12 percent of activations in December compared with 51 percent for iPhones and 26 percent for Samsung devices. Localytics, which tracks app activity on nearly 2 billion smartphones, also reported Pixel activations have steadily increased since sales began, especially around the Thanksgiving weekend and the holidays. "It looks like it has the potential to be a strong competitor to the likes of Apple and Samsung," says Josh Todd, Localytics' chief marketing officer.

Yet Amazon.com’s surprise success sets up a long-term battle with Apple and Alphabet’s Google for primacy in the connected household. And the contours of that competition are following a classic tech industry dynamic. Amazon’s Alexa is the talk of CES 2017, as gadget makers rush out voice-activated machines for the smart home Amazon is pursuing an open-systems approach that allows quick development of many features, while Apple is taking a slower route, asserting more control over the technology in order to assure security and ease-of-use. The strategic importance of the “connected home” niche looms large: Amazon wants a way to own its customer interactions -mainly shopping online - without an Apple phone or a Google Web browser as an intermediary. Apple needs to keep the iPhone at the centre of customers’ lives, and has built a whole home automation architecture, called Homekit, into its smartphone. Google, for its part, is investing heavily in both intelligent assistant software and home-automation devices like the Nest thermostats and, more recently, the Google Home speaker. But Google is behind in the race, with its speaker only hitting the market in November and compatible with a handful of gadgets beyond Nest and Dropcam, which the company also owns. “When the iPhone rolled out in 2007, everyone developed for that. Right now, everyone is developing for the voice-activated Internet,” said Mark Mahaney, an analyst and managing director with RBC Capital Markets. Mahaney estimates Amazon sold as many as 10 million Alexa-enabled devices over the holiday season. Google hasn’t disclosed sales for its Home speaker. Apple has declined to comment on reports that it has a voice-activated speaker in the works. How Hong Kong’s smart home inventions will change our lives Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said the company is leading the industry by being the first to integrate home automation into a major platform with iOS 10. “The number of HomeKit-compatible accessories continues to grow rapidly with many exciting solutions announced just this month,” she said. For the smart home, the key developer partners are the makers of household devices ranging from lighting systems to refrigerators. There are currently about 250 devices that are certified to work with Alexa, and Amazon has encouraged rapid development of third-party applications with its open-systems approach and even financial incentives for some partners. Apple’s Homekit, by contrast, has about 100 certified devices. And the reasons behind that gap show both the risks and the potential rewards of Apple’s approach. To be Homekit-certified, gadget makers must include special chips to work with Apple’s system. Developers that order small volumes of the chips say they can cost an 50 US cents to US$2, though prices are lower for larger buyers. Apple also requires developers to buy specific WiFi and Bluetooth networking chips that cost more than competitors. Smart homes and smart appliances are the new household trend The devices have to be made in special factories that are certified by Apple. A confidential Apple document obtained by Reuters lists more than 800 of these factories, but only a few specialise in home automation products. Developers can ask Apple to certify an unlisted factory they want to use. But the limited selection means that device makers can’t always get the best prices or work with their preferred factories. The founder of one startup that considered pursuing HomeKit approval for a device that helps control home temperatures said the company picked a factory with 40,000 employees that was making well known “Star Wars” toys, but it couldn’t use that factory for HomeKit products. “They’re a huge company, a legitimate manufacturer that makes tech household brands. And yet they’re not certified,” said the founder, who declined to speak on the record because of non-disclosure agreements with Apple. Manufacturers also have to send product samples to Cupertino, where Apple tests them extensively for compatibility. The whole process can take three to five months. During that time, device makers aren’t allowed to say publicly that they’re pursuing HomeKit certification. Some developers say it’s worth it. “They found issues with our product before we released it that we didn’t find in our testing,” said Gimmy Chu, CEO of Nanoleaf, a smart lighting system. “We know that after we have the certification that it’s rock solid.” Alexa, by contrast, only requires smart home companies to write software code and submit it to Amazon for review. There are no special chips. To earn the “Works with Alexa” label -which isn’t required to function with Alexa but does help promote products on Amazon’s website - startups must have their products physically tested. Amazon does allow that to happen in a third-party lab, however. Once those certifications are in hand, Amazon says it will decide whether or not a device gets the “Works with Alexa” label within 10 days. Apple’s approach has some clear advantages when it comes to privacy, security and ease-of-use. HomeKit gadgets, for example, can operate without being connected to the Internet. An iPad or Apple TV connected to the Internet is required if you want to control devices when you’re outside the house. “It also makes for a better user experience,” notes Ahmed Abdallah, a senior engineer at Incipio, which makes HomeKit-compatible devices such as electrical outlets. “You’ll experience some latency if you’re always having to bounce off the cloud” as with Alexa. Apple also has an advantage around setup. iPhone owners open up the Home app and set up a device with just a few taps. With Alexa, customers have to download the gadget’s companion app first, set up the device, then add a “skill” to Alexa in the Alexa app. Apple’s ease of setup lured in some big brands like Hunter Fan Company, the top-selling ceiling fan maker in the US. “If that experience isn’t good, it has a strong negative halo on the brand because customers just assume the product is bad,” said John Neilson, the company’s chief marketing officer. Amazon acknowledges that unlike Apple, it can’t guarantee the security of third-party devices. A company spokeswoman did note that sensitive commands like unlocking doors have an extra layer of security such as a voice-controlled PIN. Still, it’s not clear whether Apple’s elaborate but slow-to-develop system will have enough advantages to overcome Amazon’s widening lead. “The danger I see for Apple and the home is they’re assuming that because I have a smartphone that may be an Apple device, that alone is enough of a Trojan horse to establish their mindshare,” said Andreas Stavropoulos, a partner at venture capital firm DFJ. “I wouldn’t say that’s certain yet.”   Most Popular Viewed 1 China tightens Great Firewall, outlawing unauthorised VPNs 2 Hard times ahead for China’s economy, says Alibaba’s Jack Ma 3 US$15 million computer system to tackle cybersecurity 4 Alibaba’s shares rise on higher full-year revenue forecast 5 China sets up 100 billion yuan state fund to invest in the internet Shared 1 China tightens Great Firewall, outlawing unauthorised VPNs 2 Prepare for robotics, AI to worsen the backlash of globalisation 3 Internet+ turning into a buzzword in China 4 Hard times ahead for China’s economy, says Alibaba’s Jack Ma 5 China sets up 100 billion yuan state fund to invest in the internet Commented 1 Chinese singles pay triple for fake partners over Lunar New Year 2 Upturn in hiking in Hong Kong also has a downside 3 The 10 best nuts to eat and why they’re so good for you 4 Top 10 most recommended Hong Kong restaurants 5 Doctors save woman by removing her lungs for six days Promotions Register for a free copy of Home Essentials 2017 now       You may also like World Trump taps ex-Hong Kong businessman for US Navy secretary 26 Jan 2017 - 10:14pm 7 Smart-home kits keep pet owners connected In partnership with: HKT PREMIER Hong Kong Canadian Chinese man loses bid to help son acquire HK passport 26 Jan 2017 - 9:26am 14 High-density 3D imaging makes 3D photos and videos available to all Sponsored by: The Hong Kong Polytechnic University Hong Kong Joshua Wong hopes Netflix airing of film will raise awareness 26 Jan 2017 - 12:23am 56 China Millions on the move in China’s Lunar New Year rush 25 Jan 2017 - 3:04pm 3 Hong Kong Hong Kong denies Beijing role in seizure of Singaporean troop carriers 26 Jan 2017 - 4:13pm 72 China invests billions in the US ... who gets the most? 25 Jan 2017 - 1:36pm 2 Geopolitics Hong Kong to return seized armoured vehicles to Singapore 25 Jan 2017 - 12:24pm 87 China How does China’s ‘One Belt, One Road’ match up against the TPP? 24 Jan 2017 - 11:17pm 3 China China tightens Great Firewall, outlawing unauthorised VPNs 23 Jan 2017 - 11:26pm 26 Lifestyle Lunar New Year feng shui: how to decorate your home Jan 25th 2017, 5:42pm South China Morning Post Stay connected Facebook Twitter Hong Kong Politics Economy Health & Environment Law & Crime Education & Community News China Hong Kong Asia World China Policies & Politics Diplomacy & Defence Money & Wealth Society Economy Tech Business Companies Markets Property Investor Relations Mutual Funds Economy China Economy Money & Wealth Country Reports Tech China Tech Enterprises Social & Gadgets Start-ups Apps & Gaming Innovation Leaders & Founders Science & Research E-Commerce Lifestyle Arts & Entertainment Health & Beauty Film & TV Food & Drink Families Music Fashion & Luxury Books Travel & Leisure Watches Sport Hong Kong China Golf Racing Rugby Soccer Tennis Boxing Comment Insight & Opinion Harry's View Blogs Polls Letters Multimedia Video Photos Infographics SCMP Chronicles Magazine Post Magazine Style Good Eating Destination Macau HK Magazine Archive Other Weather Most Popular 7 Days Index Country Reports Crossword Promotions Directories Luxehomes At your service Business Services Directory MICE Biz Restaurant Directory Information Buy SCMP Photos Copyright Licensing RSS Feeds SCMP.com search Historical Archive Print Subscription Advertising Opportunities Contact our Advertising Sales HK Rate card Overseas Rate Card China Rate Card The Marketer SCMP Marketing Solutions SCMP Outdoor Advertising Recruitment Advertising Events SCMP Events Operation Santa Claus Other Sites CPJobs.com Education Post Young Post Cosmopolitan CosmoGIRL!

SUBSCRIBE How to check which URLs have been indexed without upsetting Google: A follow-up How can we determine which of our site pages aren't indexed without running afoul of Google's guidelines? Columnist Paul Shapiro shares his methods. Paul Shapiro on January 27, 2017 at 12:20 pm More Back in October 2016, I wrote about how you can use a Python script to determine whether a page has been indexed by Google in the SERPs. As it turns out, Google’s webmaster trends analyst Gary Illyes wasn’t too happy with the technique that was being utilized by the script, so I cannot endorse this method: I'll just leave this here: https://t.co/NO4s6JbSfJ https://t.co/qRhIGXcG7g — Gary Illyes ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ (@methode) October 5, 2016 Shortly after, Sean Malseed and his team at Greenlane SEO built a similar tool based in Google Sheets (among other awesome tools like InfiniteSuggest), and Googler John Mueller expressed reservations: @greenlaneseo Is this a blackhat tool or does it abide by the webmaster guidelines & robots.txt? (just curious) — John ☆.o(≧▽≦)o.☆ (@JohnMu) December 14, 2016 How could I learn which pages weren’t indexed by Google, and do it in a way that didn’t break Google’s rules? Google doesn’t indicate whether a page has been indexed in Google Search Console, won’t let us scrape search results to get the answer and isn’t keen on indirectly getting the answer from an undocumented API. (That was Sean Malseed’s clever solution and scraping workaround.) Let’s explore some solutions. The analytics solution Mark Edmondson provided an R script solution that works by doing the following: It authenticates with your Google Analytics accounts. It looks to see if there are pages found within your site’s XML sitemap but not found in Google Analytics for organic Google results, from the last 30 (or more) days. The methodology assumes that if a URL is not found in analytics for Google organic search results, then it likely hasn’t been indexed by Google. Interlude: How to do this without R While I personally like scripted solutions, I know many people do not. You don’t need to figure out R to do this analysis. You can easily head over to Google Analytics and do a similar analysis — or, even more easily, head over to Google Analytics Query Explorer and run it with these settings. Download the table as a TSV: You can then download your XML sitemap locally and open it into Excel. Next, drag it into the Excel window, and you will get the “Import XML” dialogue box. If it asks you to “Open the file without applying a stylesheet,” select OK: Then, choose to open the file “As an XML table”: You can remove the extraneous columns, keeping only the “ns1:loc” (or “loc”) column: Then, you simply need to do a VLOOKUP or other form of Excel matching and find the URLs in the sitemap that aren’t present in the analytics data. I thought this was a simple yet clever solution, and although a good starting place, I feared it wouldn’t accurately show which pages were indexed by Google. It is not that uncommon for pages to receive little or no traffic even if they are indexed. It may be an indication that the page isn’t indexed, but it also may just show that the page has a tagging issue, has become irrelevant, is in need of some optimization to improve its visibility or simply is not present in the XML sitemap. (Alternatively, you can use a crawl, rather than your XML sitemap, to make these comparisons.) The log file solution Server log files are an excellent source of data about your website that is often inaccessible via other means. One of the many pieces of information that can be derived from these log files is whether or not a certain bot accessed your website. In our case, the bot we are concerned with is Googlebot. Analyzing our server log files allows us to ascertain whether Googlebot has ever visited a certain page on our website. If Googlebot has never visited a certain page, then it cannot have been indexed by Google. I personally tend to use KNIME for this purpose, with the built-in Web Log Reader node, but feel free to use your favorite solution. Example of using KNIME to process server log files Make sure to verify Googlebot, and do not simply rely on the reported user-agent. Many bots will spoof the Googlebot user-agent, which may invalidate your findings. To avoid this, I use a simple Python snippet within KNIME: import socket try: output_table['dnshost'] = socket.gethostbyaddr(str(ipaddressvariable))[0] except Exception: output_table['dnshost'] = "error" For a decent guide about log file analysis, please check out this guide by Builtvisible. If this is all a bit much, I recommend checking out The Screaming Frog SEO Log File Analyzer — or, for an enterprise solution, Botify. Screaming Frog Log File Analyzer provides an easier solution for log file analysis. Like the Google Analytics solution, the log file analysis isn’t foolproof. It may be possible for Googlebot to visit a page but not actually include it in its index (<meta name=”robots” content=”noindex, follow”>), but it will help us narrow down our list of possibly non-indexed web pages. Combining your data To narrow down our list of pages that may not be indexed by Google as much as possible, I recommend combining data captured using the Google Analytics technique with the log file analysis methods above. Once we have our list, we can do some spot-checking by manually searching Google for “info:”, which won’t upset Google. It’s much easier to manually check, because we’ve been able to narrow down our list significantly. Conclusion Since Google does not provide a tool or data on whether a web page has been indexed or not, and we aren’t allowed to use an automated solution like the one I previously wrote about, we must rely on narrowing down our list of URLs that may not be indexed. We can do this by examining our Analytics data for pages that are on our website but not receiving organic Google traffic, and by looking in server log files. From there, we can manually spot-check our shortened list of URLs. It’s not an ideal solution, but it gets the job done. I hope that in the future, Google will provide a better means of assessing which pages have been indexed and which ones have not.

Possibly the fact that users don't have to install them. They simply visit the website and use the app. Of course many web app creators wish that their app could have more presence on the device, i.e. they would quite like it to be installed so that the user will return again and again. Well, it seems that in Google's collective brain the instant gratification of web apps is more important.  Here is the I/O 2016 presentation:   An instant App is a standard Android Native App - i.e. written in Java with some C/C++ if needed and served to the end user as if it was a web page. That is the instant app is downloaded and run on-the-fly. The user selects a link to the app and then just gets to use it. If they like it they can also opt to install it without having to revisit the app store.  In principle, you don't need to do anything special to make your app instant. That is, you don't need to create two versions of your app - the same code can be run in either installed or on-the-fly mode. However, to make it workable you will have to make some changes. The most obvious is to put your app on a weight loss diet. Yes you have to shrink the size of the API so that it can be downloaded as quickly as possible. This might be extra work, but it's worth it even for the installable app. Next you have to support URL-based navigation. The Instant App API supports the transfer of a URL that the user clicks on to a single Activity in your app. If you want to start another Activity then it has to use the URL address for that Activity.  A very vague requirement is to refactor your app so that any URL addressable module is under 4MBytes in size. That is, effectively an Instant app cannot be larger than 4MBytes unless it divides itself into a set of smaller Instant apps each one invokable using a URL. Obviously how much this looks like a single app is going to depend on how fast the network connection is.  There are also a list of smaller requirements including to use Android 6.0 permissions and implement smart lock if you authenticate users. There are also some unsupported features most of which are perfectly reasonable. Instant apps cannot:  Run on the device without users being aware. Foreground services are available. Instant apps can only be started through activities that support App Links, so services, content providers or broadcast receivers won't be able to start your app. Push notifications are currently not supported in instant apps. Access external storage on the device. However, instant apps can temporarily use internal storage private to the app. Discover or interact directly with the list of installed apps on the device (e.g. via explicit intents). Receive broadcasts from the system or other installed apps, or use GCM. In the future, instant apps may support a limited set of broadcasts while the app is running. Access device identifiers that (1) persist longer than the instant app and (2) are not resettable by the user (e.g. Settings Secure Android ID (SSAID), Build Serial, Mac Addresses, IMEI, IMSI). NOTE: developers will have access to the Advertising ID. Change device settings (e.g. change the user's wallpaper).  It is worth checking that your app doesn't do any of these things before spending time on the other issues.  Some Instant Apps are already rolling out to some users: "We’ve been working with a small number of developers to refine the user and developer experiences. Today, a few of these Instant Apps will be available to Android users for the first time in a limited test, including apps from BuzzFeed, Wish, Periscope, and Viki. By collecting user feedback and iterating on the product, we’ll be able to expand the experience to more apps and more users." At the moment if you want to get in on the act you have to submit your request to Google to be included in the preview.  Is the Instant App concept a good one? Without fast WiFi and 4G networking it is a very bad idea. If you have a large app then giving the user the opportunity to download it every time they run it is probably not a selling point. You also need to keep in mind that the user might not know that your app is being delivered as an Instant App and might just think that the sluggish behavior is your fault.  If the app is small and can work by downloading small chunks of new data and behavior then perhaps it will give the user a good enough experience. What this means is that you are probably going to have to do more work refactoring your app than Google suggests. As a way of easing the initial install barrier it seems like a good idea, but we all want the user to stick with the app and install it. So Instant Apps are more like a "try it before you buy it" feature.    More Information Android Instant Apps starts initial live testing Related Articles Android Wear 2.0 To Launch In February Android Says Goodbye To Eclipse Android Studio 2.2 Now Available For All Android Adventures - Getting Started Creating A UI Android Adventures - Mastering Fragments As well as being editor of I Programmer, Mike James is the author of Android Programming: Starting With An App (I/O Press) which is based on the first set of our Android Adventures series.   To be informed about new articles on I Programmer, sign up for our weekly newsletter, subscribe to the RSS feed and follow us on, Twitter, Facebook, Google+ or Linkedin.    Mozilla Looks Into Health of Internet 25/01/2017 Mozilla has released The Internet Health Report v.0.1 covering five key topics: decentralization, digital inclusion, open innovation, privacy and security, and web literacy.

Timothy J. Seppala, @timseppala 14h ago in Internet Comments 298 Shares Share Tweet Share Save Getty It's one thing to have read about (and reported on) the various threats of violence perpetrated by GamerGate, but seeing the FBI's collection of documents regarding the harassment campaign is entirely different. The Bureau recently released a 173-page document that compiles a plethora of emails and tweets received, seemingly, by targets including culture critic Anita Sarkeesian and game developer Brianna Wu. There are also internal reports, police reports and letters of request to various gaming and tech companies. I only say "seemingly" because names, email addresses and identifying information has been redacted throughout the report. But lining up the emails with dates and news stories, it's plainly obvious who the trolls were writing to. One email to the Utah State University's Taggart Student Center boasts: "You can try calling the FBI to come arrest me, but I'm behind 7 proxies and you'll never be able to backtrack this IP. Can't lulzback the [redacted]." As you'll see, that confidence was not misplaced. Other bits include formal FBI reports on the activities and investigations of bomb-threat suspects and Twitter users freely distributing personal identifying information (doxxing). For the latter, the FBI had the users' account information, IP address and the threatening posts in question. Also included are requests from the FBI to Google for compliance to help with the investigations. In an email regarding a YouTube account, the FBI asked Google to: "take all necessary steps to preserve for a period of ninety (90) days any and all record and other evidence, including, but not limited to all e-mail, Google Talk histories, buddy lists, profiles, subscriber information, method of payment and detailed billing logs in its possession relating to the email accounts. "The FBI is also requesting that Google Inc take all necessary steps to preserve for a period of ninety (90) days any and all records, videos, content and other evidence for the following YouTube account: [redacted]." Similar messages were sent to Microsoft. In one internal report, the FBI details its use of Palantir to "analyze results obtained from a subpoena request to Twitter" for account info pertaining to a threat posted by a user. There's no shortage of galling information to sift through, including, as The Verge points out, a report detailing an interview between the Bureau and one of the harassers who was let off with little more than a slap on the wrist. The suspect admitted to calling and threatening a target 40 to 50 times a day by phone. After telling the agent they would stop the harassment, it seems like nothing further was done. The closing report, dated September 21st, 2015, is again heavily redacted but essentially says that even with reviewing the dozens of threats, issuing subpoenas and tracking IP addresses that "no additional subjects or actionable leads were developed." The investigation into GamerGate was closed that year.

Like this story, share it with millions of investors on M3 Apple strategy in smart home race threatened by Amazon In less than a year, Amazon's combination of the Echo speaker system and the Alexa voice-controlled digital assistant has come close to delivering on the elusive promise of easy-to-use technology that can control gadgets in the home with a few spoken words. Post Your Comments Share Cancel In less than a year, Amazon's combination of the Echo speaker system and the Alexa voice-controlled digital assistant has come close to delivering on the elusive promise of easy-to-use technology that can control gadgets in the home with a few spoken words. Yet Amazon.com Inc's surprise success sets up a long-term battle with Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc's Google for primacy in the connected household. And the contours of that competition are following a classic tech industry dynamic. Amazon is pursuing an open-systems approach that allows quick development of many features, while Apple is taking a slower route, asserting more control over the technology in order to assure security and ease-of-use. The strategic importance of the "connected home" niche looms large: Amazon wants a way to own its customer interactions -mainly shopping online - without an Apple phone or a Google Web browser as an intermediary. Apple needs to keep the iPhone at the center of customers’ lives, and has built a whole home automation architecture, called Homekit, into its smartphone. Google, for its part, is investing heavily in both intelligent assistant software and home-automation devices like the Nest thermostats and, more recently, the Google Home speaker. But Google is behind in the race, with its speaker only hitting the market in November and compatible with a handful of gadgets beyond Nest and Dropcam, which the company also owns. “When the iPhone rolled out in 2007, everyone developed [software] for that. Right now, everyone is developing for the voice-activated Internet,” said Mark Mahaney, an analyst and managing director with RBC Capital Markets. Mahaney estimates Amazon sold as many as 10 million Alexa-enabled devices over the holiday season. Google hasn't disclosed sales for its Home speaker. Apple has declined to comment on reports that it has a voice-activated speaker in the works. Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said the company is leading the industry by being the first to integrate home automation into a major platform with iOS 10. “The number of HomeKit-compatible accessories continues to grow rapidly with many exciting solutions announced just this month,” she said. For the smart home, the key developer partners are the makers of household devices ranging from lighting systems to refrigerators. There are currently about 250 devices that are certified to work with Alexa, and Amazon has encouraged rapid development of third-party applications with its open-systems approach and even financial incentives for some partners. Apple's Homekit, by contrast, has about 100 certified devices. And the reasons behind that gap show both the risks and the potential rewards of Apple's approach. HOW APPLE EXERTS CONTROL To be Homekit-certified, gadget makers must include special chips to work with Apple’s system. Developers that order small volumes of the chips say they can cost an 50 cents to USD2, though prices are lower for larger buyers. Apple also requires developers to buy specific WiFi and Bluetooth networking chips that cost more than competitors. The devices have to be made in special factories that are certified by Apple. A confidential Apple document obtained by Reuters lists more than 800 of these factories, but only a few specialize in home automation products. Developers can ask Apple to certify an unlisted factory they want to use. But the limited selection means that device makers can't always get the best prices or work with their preferred factories. The founder of one startup that considered pursuing HomeKit approval for a device that helps control home temperatures said the company picked a factory with 40,000 employees that was making well known "Star Wars" toys, but it couldn't use that factory for HomeKit products. "They're a huge company, a legitimate manufacturer that makes tech household brands. And yet they're not [Apple] certified," said the founder, who declined to speak on the record because of non-disclosure agreements with Apple. Manufacturers also have to send product samples to Cupertino, where Apple tests them extensively for compatibility. The whole process can take three to five months. During that time, device makers aren't allowed to say publicly that they're pursuing HomeKit certification. Some developers say it's worth it. "They found issues with our product before we released it that we didn't find in our testing," said Gimmy Chu, CEO of Nanoleaf, a smart lighting system. "We know that after we have the certification that it's rock solid." AMAZON'S "OPEN" APPROACH Alexa, by contrast, only requires smart home companies to write software code and submit it to Amazon for review. There are no special chips. To earn the "Works with Alexa" label -which isn’t required to function with Alexa but does help promote products on Amazon’s website - startups must have their products physically tested. Amazon does allow that to happen in a third-party lab, however. Once those certifications are in hand, Amazon says it will decide whether or not a device gets the “Works with Alexa” label within 10 days. Apple's approach has some clear advantages when it comes to privacy, security and ease-of-use. HomeKit gadgets, for example, can operate without being connected to the Internet. (An iPad or Apple TV connected to the Internet is required if you want to control devices when you’re outside the house.) “It also makes for a better user experience,” notes Ahmed Abdallah, a senior engineer at Incipio, which makes HomeKit-compatible devices such as electrical outlets. “You’ll experience some latency if you’re always having to bounce off the cloud” as with Alexa. Apple also has an advantage around setup. iPhone owners open up the Home app and set up a device with just a few taps. With Alexa, customers have to download the gadget’s companion app first, set up the device, then add a “skill” to Alexa in the Alexa app. Apple's ease of setup lured in some big brands like Hunter Fan Company, the top-selling ceiling fan maker in the U.S. “If that experience isn’t good, it has a strong negative halo on the brand because customers just assume the product is bad,” said John Neilson, the company’s chief marketing officer. Amazon acknowledges that unlike Apple, it can't guarantee the security of third-party devices. A company spokeswoman did note that sensitive commands like unlocking doors have an extra layer of security such as a voice-controlled PIN. Still, it's not clear whether Apple's elaborate but slow-to-develop system will have enough advantages to overcome Amazon's widening lead. “The danger I see for Apple and the home is they’re assuming that because I have a smartphone that may be an Apple device, that alone is enough of a Trojan horse to establish their mindshare,” said Andreas Stavropoulos, a partner at venture capital firm DFJ. “I wouldn’t say that's certain yet.”   Tags  Amazon Echo speaker system technology Buy, Hold, Sell ?

Further, in a statement to 9to5Google, the company suggested that users may want to begin using the new Google Voice apps for iOS, Android and web in concert with Hangouts. “Going forward, we’ll provide new updates and features to the Google Voice apps. If you currently use Hangouts for your Google Voice communication, there’s no need to change to the new apps, but you might want to try them out as we continue to bring new improvements,” said the company. The Google Voice app currently lacks VoIP, making it impossible to make or receive phone calls without Hangouts unless the user sets up call forwarding, but the app is set to become self-sufficient soon, at least on Android. The company told 9to5Google that it is working on VoIP integration for Android, without adding further details. Meanwhile, in an August interview with Google’s VP of communications Nick Fox, Engadget was told that Hangouts would increasingly focus on entering the “group collaboration enterprise productivity space.” A 9to5Google tipster goes on to indicate that to enter that enterprise space, “heavy encryption” is in the works. With the sun slowly setting on the consumer version of Hangouts, Canadians may want to begin their search for a similar platform that will suit their needs. Meanwhile, the development of Google Voice as a self-contained app could indicate a renewed dedication to the service and, perhaps, a return to Canada in the future. Google Voice pushed a major update in October 2015 that included adding an approved carrier list to the app, preventing Canadian users from using the service.

I completely understand if you weren’t one of them, but it may hold interest for others. Thanks for your comment. Justin I am one of those Canadians who used Google Voice through hangouts often. This news is disappointing, considering we(Google fans, and android users) have been waiting what seems forever to have Google Voice compatibility in Canada. I hope this does not mark the end of voice call through Google now that they have transitioned Hangouts to enterprise use. Personally, Google could have integrated Duo, Allo, and Google Voice into one application – better yet! Google could have integrated Google Voice into the dialer, as other app developers have been able to do successfully.

Blame Google’s gradual rollout for why you’re still seeing the old version. Raj Singh Don’t need to blame anyone. Just an observation. I’m sure they’ll get around to it eventually. john910 I see a lot of changes to Canadian side as well. I do have a US google voice number. Sometime in 2012 I guess there was some kind of bug which let me verify my Canadian cell phone number. So all calls to US google voice number were ringing my Canadian phone number. But I could never initial call from google voice which will ring my Canadian number and then connect other number. That started to work now. So they have already done some changes.. I tried sending MMS to Canadian number and receiving it.. so that works as well Brian G.

Apple’s Siri chief joins Partnership on A.I. board After a big 2016, next year may be A.I. tipping point Video Review: Huawei's Mate 9 gives good value for the price Apple has joined rivals as it takes a step to advance research and development of artificial intelligence technologies. After months of collaborating, Apple is joining the Partnership on A.I., with other founding members including Google, IBM, Microsoft, Facebook, and Amazon. The Partnership on A.I. was founded in September last year to also steer debate on best practices on A.I. The group believes A.I. could help in the areas of health care, transportation, and automation in factories. Apple's most visible A.I. technology is Siri, a voice assistant that can answer questions. But a larger A.I. strategy is still a subject of speculation. Microsoft, Facebook, IBM, Amazon, and Google have well established A.I. strategies. Speech and recognition are well-known use cases for A.I. Apple will likely implement A.I. in its mysterious autonomous car project so self-driving vehicles can navigate and cruise the roads safely without a human at the wheel. Beyond the Alexa voice assistant, Amazon uses A.I. to provide buying recommendations. Google this week said it was providing TensorFlow tools so users can build a wide variety of A.I. capabilities into Raspberry Pi 3 and IBM's high-powered cognitive computers. The group believes A.I. holds tremendous promise and will lead to a big societal impact. A.I.'s impact needs to be discussed, and companies need to establish ground rules on how the technology is developed and deployed, according to the group. The Partnership on A.I. is establishing a diverse board to bring in a variety of opinions. The board includes personnel from the top companies and members from universities and organizations like the American Civil Liberties Union, the MacArthur Foundation, and the Peterson Institute for International Economics. There is a lot of cooperation among organizations pursuing A.I. research. Tesla co-founder Elon Musk has poured $1 billion into OpenAI, which is also a member of the Partnership on A.I.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Artificial intelligence is expanding at an incredibly rapid pace; it’s also terribly fragmented when it comes to personal AI assistants on our gadgets. Google Assistant works on Google Home and the Pixel, but it operates differently depending on the device. Amazon Alexa works on Amazon Fire devices, the Echo and soon, the Huawei P9. Siri works on Apple TV, Macs and the Apple Watch. Cortana works on Windows 10 PCs. And across all of these devices, you’ll find some functions work in one place while others work in another. The company that wins this battle will have its assistant on the most devices, independent of platform. If we use Siri as an example, then my argument is that Siri needs to be everywhere, not just on Apple products. Apple needs to put Siri on as many machines as possible, whether they run macOS, Android or even Windows 10. My reasoning is simple. When I’m at work on my Windows 10 PC, I interact with Cortana. When I go to turn off my lights, I interact with Google Home or Amazon Alexa. When I ask the weather from my smart watch, I talk to Siri. When I ask my Android phone to play music, I speak with Google Assistant. That makes no sense. AI, to really cater to us in the way each company hopes it will, needs to gather as much personal information as it can about our lifestyles (and keep it private, of course.) If I’m talking to Siri in one place, I should be talking to Siri in every place. Then she’ll start to learn my habits – when I turn off the lights, when I wake up, when my meetings are, and the like. She’ll truly start to learn about me because she’ll be with me, like a true assistant. The argument applies to all AI assistants, though. Alexa should be on the PC and easily accessible on Macs and the iPhone. Same with Google Assistant. And no matter the device, the experience needs to be consistent. If you have one amazingly smart assistant on one single device, that AI is going to lose out to a dumber assistant that’s more accessible. The most common AI will win Amazon and Google seem to be making strides in the right directions. Alexa is now built into home appliances such as refrigerators, will soon debut on the Huawei Mate 9 in the US and is expanding into other third-party gadgets, too. If Microsoft, Google and Apple want to compete in the long run, they need to execute a similar strategy now. Yes, even if that means putting Siri on Android.

Although Google hasn't released sales figures, industry researchers say the Pixel [pictured above] has been a hot item since its October debut was greeted with mostly glowing reviews and the biggest marketing blitz in Google's 18-year history. But there were missed opportunities. Google didn't have enough Pixels available to meet demand. Rather than wait several weeks, many consumers interested in the Pixel probably bought an iPhone, Galaxy or another phone instead. And these people aren't likely to need a phone replacement for another year or two. Google also struck a deal to sell it through just one wireless carrier, Verizon. Although Google's online store sold Pixels compatible with other wireless networks, most people don't shop for phones that way. Of course, it's a moot point if there weren't enough Pixels to sell, but Google likely would have produced more if it had distribution deals with other carriers. It's not surprising that Google misjudged the market, given that this is the search company's first stab at making its own phone. Previously, it partnered with various manufacturers on a Nexus line of phones to showcase its Android operating system, but that effort barely made a dent. "This was probably a really good learning experience for them," says Neil Doshi, an analyst with Mizhuo Securities USA. The Pixel's success is important to Google because it wants to ensure there's a stylish Android phone to compete with the iPhone and drive more affluent consumers to its search engine, maps, YouTube videos and other services. Samsung's Galaxy and other phones also run on Android, but those devices have been de-emphasizing Google's services. Google, which is based in Mountain View, California, can afford to make some mistakes as it tries to establish the Pixel because its internet search and advertising network brings in so much revenue. Alphabet, Google's corporate parent, provided another reminder of its financial might with Thursday's release of its fourth-quarter earnings. The company earned $5.3 billion on revenue of $26 billion during the final three months of last year. Even after subtracting commissions paid to Google's ad partners, Alphabet's revenue totaled $21 billion -- a 23 percent increase from a year earlier. The company's profit rose 8 percent from the prior year. Although Pixel sales weren't disclosed, the numbers provided a clue on how the phone did. Google's "other revenue" segment, which covers all sales outside of advertising, generated $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter, a 62 percent increase from the same time last year. Some of those gains came from sales of Google's new internet-connected speaker, Home, and its business software services, but Doshi believes most of the increase was generated by the Pixel. He estimates Google sold 1 million to 1.5 million Pixels during the fourth quarter. That's still just a sliver of the estimated 77 million that Apple sold during the same period (Apple is scheduled to release its numbers Tuesday). Pixel sales are also well below the roughly 15 million Galaxy S7 that Samsung sold during that device's first quarter on the market. Still, analysts say the Pixel did exceptionally well for a new phone with little brand recognition. "Without question, Google has a hit on its hands and is building a platform for success," says Jeff Moore, principal of Wave7 Research. Wave7 estimates that Pixel accounted for 12 percent of activations in December compared with 51 percent for iPhones and 26 percent for Samsung devices. Localytics, which tracks app activity on nearly 2 billion smartphones, also reported Pixel activations have steadily increased since sales began, especially around the Thanksgiving weekend and the holidays. "It looks like it has the potential to be a strong competitor to the likes of Apple and Samsung," says Josh Todd, Localytics' chief marketing officer. © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

Cyberconscripts: IT Over Infantry Next Article > Rogue Tweeters in Government Could Be Prosecuted as Hackers By Ted Bridis PUBLISHED: JANUARY 27 2017 Who are the federal government's rogue tweeters, using official agency social media accounts to poke President Donald Trump? Are these acts of civil disobedience, or federal crimes? The online campaign began with unauthorized tweets -- on subjects such as climate change inconsistent with Trump's campaign statements and policies -- that have been mostly deleted from official agency accounts. It shifted tactics Thursday as at least 40 new but unofficial "alternative" accounts for federal agencies began spreading across Twitter. It wasn't clear how many unofficial accounts were run by government employees, but there were early indications that at least some were created by federal workers using their work email addresses -- and that may have exposed their identities. The administration said the earlier Twitter actions involved tweets by unauthorized users -- at least one was a former employee -- who still had passwords for the agency accounts, including one case involving the account for the Redwoods National Park in California. Legal experts said the Justice Department could prosecute such tweeters under federal hacking laws, but the FBI so far was not involved. "An unauthorized user had an old password in the San Francisco office, went in and started retweeting inappropriate things that were in violation of their policy," White House spokesman Sean Spicer said. Separately, the National Park Service said tweets published earlier this week on the account of the Badlands National Park in South Dakota were posted by a former employee not authorized to use the account. Employees or former employees publishing unauthorized messages on official accounts could be prosecuted under the U.S. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, which prohibits someone from exceeding authorized access to computers. "The argument would be that the authorization to use the account was only for employees and implicitly that was extinguished when the employee left government employment," said Orin Kerr, a law professor at George Washington University. Even employees authorized to use official agency Twitter accounts could face legal jeopardy posting messages they weren't supposed to write, said Stewart Baker, a cybersecurity lawyer and former National Security Agency and Department of Homeland Security official. "If someone says you may not tweet except in these circumstances, and you tweet in other circumstances, you're exceeding authority," Baker said. He added that some federal courts would examine the security measures in place and could throw out cases where employees weren't clearly violating them. "It wouldn't surprise me if at this stage a criminal investigation was opened and criminal tools were used to investigate this, even if at the end of the day they decided not to pursue criminal charges," Baker said. A federal law enforcement official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter by name, said he was unaware of any requests from federal agencies to investigate the rogue tweets. The unauthorized messages posted under official accounts appeared to be dropping off, as the Trump administration regained control over its agency accounts. Over last weekend, immediately after Trump's inauguration, transition staff changed all social media passwords for the Environmental Protection Agency, said Jared Blumenfeld, a former EPA official under the Obama administration who said he was speaking regularly with former colleagues. Starting Wednesday, scores of unofficial Twitter accounts appeared purporting to represent federal agencies, mocking Trump using the same social media service the president uses daily. At least some were linked to federal employees using work email addresses who inadvertently revealed their involvement. Twitter users can choose to allow others on the service to find them by searching for their email address. In other cases, Twitter notified users who previously shared their online address books using Twitter's "Find Friends" feature that anonymous accounts were created by federal employees whose work email addresses were already in those address books. One side effect to the Twitter dispute? Some U.S. government Twitter accounts saw surges in followers. "We're thrilled you found us," said the official account for Biscayne National Park in Florida, "for whatever reason." © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

Anytime. Anywhere. Google Chrome Browser Promises It Can Do Better By Jef Cozza / NewsFactor Network PUBLISHED: JANUARY 27 2017 The latest version of Google's Chrome browser is faster and more secure than previous versions -- up to 28 percent faster. The new version, Chrome v56, is due to be rolled out over the next few days and weeks, the company said. The change behind the faster loading speeds has to do with the way the browser validates information when reloading a page. In addition to being faster, the new behavior also results in up to 60 percent fewer validation requests, which should also help save on bandwidth and power, two major concerns for enterprise users, according to Google. Simplified Reload Behavior "When reloading a page, browsers will check with the web server if cached resources are still usable, a process known as validation," Takashi Toyoshima wrote on Google's Chromium blog yesterday. "This typically results in hundreds of network requests per page issued to dozens of domains. On mobile devices, the high latency and transient nature of mobile connections mean that this behavior can produce serious performance issues." Toyoshima said that users typically reload either because pages are broken or the content seems stale. Chrome’s existing reload behavior usually solves broken pages, but stale content is inefficiently addressed by a regular reload, especially on mobile devices. "This feature was originally designed in times when broken pages were quite common, so it was reasonable to address both use cases at once," Toyoshima said. However, this original concern has now become far less relevant as the quality of Web pages has increased. To improve the stale content use case, Chrome now has a simplified reload behavior to only validate the main resource and continue with a regular page load. This new behavior maximizes the reuse of cached resources and results in lower latency, power consumption and data usage, according to Google. The company said it worked with both Facebook and Mozilla, the company behind the open-source Firefox browser, to develop the faster validation behavior. HTTP Warnings for Banking Web sites Faster speeds are not the only improvement in the new Chrome version. Version 56 will also include 51 different security fixes for the Windows, macOS and Linux operating systems to help make the browser safer to use. Among the fixes is a new tool that will flag pages that collect information about banks and accounts using the HTTP protocol, rather than the more secure HTTPS protocol. Chrome users will see a label reading "Not Secure" in the address bar to hammer the point home. Firefox, which worked with Chrome on the security fix, will also be introducing a similar feature as it rolls out its next update. In addition, the new Chrome version adds Web Bluetooth API support on Android, Chrome OS, and macOS to make it possible for sites to interact with low-energy Bluetooth devices.

Next Article > Saudi Arabia Warns Destructive Computer Virus Has Returned By Jon Gambrell PUBLISHED: JANUARY 25 2017 Saudi Arabia is warning that a computer virus that destroyed systems of its state-run oil company in 2012 has returned to the kingdom, with at least one major petrochemical company apparently affected by its spread. Suspicion for the initial dispersal of the Shamoon virus in 2012 fell on Iran as it came after the Stuxnet cyberattack targeting Tehran's contested nuclear enrichment program. It wasn't immediately clear who could be responsible for the new infection, though the relations between regional rivals remain tense. A report Monday by Saudi state-run television included comments suggesting that 15 government agencies and private institutions had been hit by the Shamoon virus, including the Saudi Labor Ministry. The ministry said it was working with the Interior Ministry to contain the virus. Sadara, a joint venture between the Saudi Arabian Oil Co. and Michigan-based Dow Chemical Co., shut down its computer network Monday over a disruption. Company spokesman Sami Amin said its network remained down Tuesday, though it hadn't affected operations at the facility. He declined to comment further. Sadara is based in Jubail Industrial City, which sits about 100 kilometers (60 miles) northwest of the eastern Saudi city of Dammam in the heartland of the kingdom's oil industry. The $20 billion facility, inaugurated by Saudi King Salman in late November, includes 26 manufacturing units that will produce more than 3 million metric tons of plastics and chemical products. Another state-run TV report on Tuesday said the Saudi Technical and Vocational Training Corp. was affected, though a spokesman denied the virus did any damage to its network. Symantec Corp., a California-based security firm, warned in late November that Shamoon had been spotted again in Saudi Arabia. Computers affected had their hard drives erased and displayed a photograph of the body of 3-year-old Syrian boy Aylan Kurdi, who drowned fleeing his country's civil war, Symantec said. "Why Shamoon has suddenly returned again after four years is unknown," Symantec said . "However, with its highly destructive payload, it is clear that the attackers want their targets to sit up and take notice." The November attacks apparently involved previously stolen passwords. Symantec on Monday said the outbreak might be linked to a group it called Greenbug, which previously attacked targets in Bahrain, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Turkey with emails carrying malicious attachments. Shamoon, named for a folder in its code, first emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2012. In that attack, which hit Saudi Aramco and Qatari natural gas producer RasGas, the virus deleted hard drives and then displayed a picture of a burning American flag on computer screens. The attack forced Saudi Aramco to shut down its network and destroyed over 30,000 computers. "All told, the Shamoon virus was probably the most destructive attack that the private sector has seen to date," then-U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said at the time. Shortly before Panetta's speech, a former U.S. official told The Associated Press that American officials firmly believed Iranian hackers likely backed by Tehran were responsible for the attack. Iran denied being responsible for the 2012 Shamoon outbreak. Tehran had no immediate comment on the new outbreak. The first emergence of Shamoon came as Iran faced international sanctions over its contested nuclear program and after it saw thousands of centrifuges destroyed by the Stuxnet virus, widely believed to be an American and Israeli creation. Last year, a series of fires at Iranian petrochemical plants and facilities have raised suspicions about hacking potentially playing a role. Hostilities persist between Shiite power Iran and Sunni-ruled Saudi Arabia. The countries support opposite sides in the wars gripping Syria and Yemen, while the kingdom has backed Bahrain's Sunni rulers amid a crackdown on dissent on the Shiite-majority island.

After months of collaborating, Apple is joining the Partnership on AI, with other founding members including Google, IBM, Microsoft, Facebook, and Amazon. The Partnership of AI was founded in September last year to also steer debate on best practices on AI. The group believes AI could help in the areas of health care, transportation, and automation in factories. Apple's most visible AI technology is Siri, a voice assistant that can answer questions. But a larger AI strategy is still a subject of speculation. Microsoft, Facebook, IBM, Amazon, and Google have well established AI strategies. Speech and recognition are well-known use cases for AI. Apple will likely implement AI in its mysterious autonomous car project so self-driving vehicles can navigate and cruise the roads safely without a human at the wheel. Beyond the Alexa voice assistant, Amazon uses AI to provide buying recommendations. Google this week said it was providing TensorFlow tools so users can build a wide variety of AI capabilities into Raspberry Pi 3 and IBM's high-powered cognitive computers. The group believes AI holds tremendous promise and will lead to a big societal impact. AI's impact needs to be discussed, and companies need to establish ground rules on how the technology is developed and deployed, according to the group. The Partnership on AI is establishing a diverse board to bring in a variety of opinions. The board includes personnel from the top companies and members from universities and organizations like American Civil Liberties Union, the MacArthur Foundation, and Peterson Institute for International Economics. There is a lot of cooperation among organizations pursuing AI research. Tesla co-founder Elon Musk has poured US$1 billion into OpenAI, which is also a member of the Partnership on AI.

Daniel Sparks (TMFDanielSparks) Jan 27, 2017 at 1:05PM Highlighting a somewhat muted response from investors, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock is trading about 0.4% lower at the time of this writing on Friday after the company reported its results for the fourth quarter of 2016. While revenue jumped 22% to $26.1 billion and surpassed analysts' consensus estimate (via Thomson Reuters) for revenue of $25.2 billion, the company's earnings of $9.36 per share fell short of a projection for $9.64. As investors digest the information from Alphabet's latest report, here's a look at some of the most insightful comments from the company's fourth-quarter earnings call. In these quotes, management discusses the success of the new Google-branded hardware, further opportunity in advertising, and what it considers the three biggest bets for the company beyond its core ad business. Google Pixel. Image source: Google. Alphabet's core search business hasn't peaked -- far from it After pointing to the company's impressive 20% consolidated revenue growth in 2016, which management emphasized is actually 24% when excluding the impact of currency headwinds, Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat emphasized (via a Reuters transcript) the opportunity ahead: This performance is a testament to the ongoing innovation that is driving our success in mobile search, YouTube, and programmatic advertising, each of which we believe has only begun to scratch the surface. We remain excited about the sizable opportunities that have not yet been tapped. These could become major revenue drivers With about 86% of Alphabet's total revenue coming from advertising, it's always nice to get an update on whether the company is seeing success on diversifying its revenue sources. To this end, Alphabet made excellent progress in its fourth quarter. Here's what Porat had to say: Alongside these [advertising] businesses, we are focused on growing additional revenue streams within Google over the medium- and long-term. In 2016, our other revenue line grew 41% on a full year basis reflecting the growth in our Play, hardware and cloud businesses. We see tremendous potential ahead for these businesses, as well as in the continued development of non-advertising revenue streams for YouTube. We're investing in our cloud and hardware businesses, as well as our newer non-ad revenue sources for YouTube, in order to accelerate their progress as major revenue drivers for Google in the next several years. Alphabet's other revenue growth in the Google segment (not to be confused with Alphabet's "other bets") was even more impressive in the company's fourth quarter specifically. Fourth-quarter other revenue soared 62% year over year, to $3.4 billion, accounting for 13% of total revenue, up from 10% of revenue in the year-ago quarter. Management cited hardware, the Google Play app store, and its cloud business as key drivers for the segment. Google Home. Image source: Google. Google-branded hardware looks promising Drilling down more narrowly on the company's nascent hardware business, which received some extra attention from the company in the fourth quarter when Google launched its voice-activated smart speaker (Google Home) and a new smartphone (Google Pixel), management was optimistic about how new hardware is performing in the marketplace. Google CEO Sundar Pichai explained: We introduced a new family of beautiful hardware devices in October that are made by Google, led by Google Home and our Pixel phone which feature the Google Assistant built in. We're thrilled with the reception, as well as the really happy customers we saw over the holiday season. In particular, Google Home was a very popular present that many people opened on Christmas morning. We have committed to this for the long-term, as a great way to bring a beautiful seamless Google experience to people. The early signs are promising, and you can expect us to see us expand our offerings thoughtfully. Alphabet's three big bets Pichai said that beyond its core advertising business, the company distinctly views "YouTube, cloud and hardware" as "three of our biggest bets." So investors should keep an eye on these areas as Alphabet continues to grow its business. Management's extreme confidence in incremental opportunity in Alphabet's core search business, along with significant and promising growth in YouTube, cloud, and hardware, continues to make a great case for owning this stock. Not only is the company strengthening the competitive position of its core business, but it's also diversifying its revenue while simultaneously opening the doors to meaningful opportunities beyond advertising.

Image: DUSTIN DRANKOSKI/MASHABLE By Kerry Flynn2017-01-26 21:53:02 UTC Search, clicks and views aren't everything for Google anymore.  Alphabet, the technology giant formerly known as Google, still makes majority of its revenue from ads, but it's starting to build big gains elsewhere.  SEE ALSO: Google's PR team penned the mother of all replies Google reported $3.7 billion in other revenue, including hardware and leaving out advertising, for the fourth quarter of 2016. In the grand scheme of Alphabet, that's quite small. It was bump up by 62 percent from the year prior. For Google, that's good.  “Our growth in the fourth quarter was exceptional," said Ruth Porat, CFO of Alphabet, in a statement. "This performance was led by mobile search and YouTube. We’re seeing great momentum in Google’s newer investment areas and ongoing strong progress in Other Bets." "Exceptional" hasn't really been visible for "other bets" prior. Other bets are still such a tiny part of Google's revenue, but it's finally starting to move the needle — and not into the red.  Updated $GOOG numbers, still lol https://t.co/ololMFLXLH pic.twitter.com/DuhmXWF1EI — Mike Murphy (@mcwm) January 26, 2017 That's an important move for Google. The company is still winning in the ad department, despite fake news sites being purged from using its ad service. But that's a shrinking market. Web and mobile ads are dropping in value. Google’s cost-per-click dropped 15 percent in the fourth quarter from the same period the year prior.  Google CEO Sundar Pichai said the company is prioritizing YouTube, integrating more machine learning to improve content and advertising. Facebook, Snapchat and other over-the-top services are biting into that as they all look to pull from TV budgets. "I think it's important for us to work in the intersection of hardware, software and services," Pichai said Thursday on a call with analysts.  Google has been making big moves in hardware. The company released its new line of smartphones called Pixel and Pixel XL in October, which is competing with Apple's iPhone. Google didn't break out how much money is coming from the new smartphones. Analysts predictions are all over the place, some pegging it at just over 500,000 and others at 1 million. It's still early days for Pixel smartphones. For now, it's limited to Verizon customers.  Google later released Google Home, its answer to Amazon Echo, a home speaker powered by a digital assistant.  "We are committed to this to the longterm as a great way to bring a seamless Google experience," Pichai said. "You can expect to see us expand our offerings thoughtfully." Google Daydream is its first VR headset, a step down from Facebook's Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. It competes with the likes of Samsung Gear VR.  But the concern around Facebook's competition extends beyond the digital ad duopoly and into video and VR. Facebook is also betting on video consumption in its platform. Facebook revealed earlier Thursday a new emphasis on longer videos in News Feed, and, on Wednesday, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced Hugo Barra (a well-respected former Googler) will run its virtual reality division. In a move that'll please investors, Alphabet has cut its losses on some efforts, known as "Other Bets." The company halted the expansion of Google Fiber, its internet project, in October last year. Those cutbacks included layoffs of employees. Craig Barratt, CEO of Google Access, also stepped down.  I feel like this label is probably relevant.

(Wiki Commons - Image Courtesy) Shares11 Fri, 27 Jan 2017-12:14am , San Francisco , PTI The biggest names in technology are in the alliance. A technology industry alliance devoted to making sure smart machines don't turn against humanity said today that Apple has signed on and will have a seat on the board. Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Facebook, IBM, and Google-owned British AI firm DeepMind last year established the non-profit organization, called "Partnership on AI," which will have its inaugural board meeting in San Francisco on February 3. Apple "has been involved and collaborating with the partnership since before it was first announced and is thrilled to formalize its membership," the alliance said in an online post. Major technology firms joined forces in the group, with stated aims including cooperation on "best practices" for AI and using the technology "to benefit people and society." Creation of the group came amid concerns that new artificial intelligence efforts could spin out of control and end up being detrimental to society. The companies "will conduct research, recommend best practices, and publish research under an open license in areas such as ethics, fairness, and inclusivity; transparency, privacy, and interoperability; collaboration between people and AI systems; and the trustworthiness, reliability, and robustness of the technology," according to a statement. Internet giants have been investing heavily in creating software to help machines think more like people, ideally acting as virtual assistants who get to know users and perhaps even anticipate needs. SpaceX founder and Tesla chief executive Elon Musk in 2015 took part in creating nonprofit research company OpenAI devoted to developing artificial intelligence that will help people and not hurt them. Musk found himself in the middle of a technology world controversy by holding firm that AI could turn on humanity and be its ruin instead of a salvation. A concern expressed by Musk was that highly advanced artificial intelligence would be left to its own devices, or in the hands of a few people, to the detriment of civilization as a whole. People joining tech company executives on the Partnership board included Dario Amodei of Open AI along with members of the American Civil Liberties Union; the MacArthur Foundation, and the University of California, Berkeley.

Sci-Tech by Eric Mack January 26, 2017 11:56 AM PST @ericcmack Up Next Meet Jon Hamm, the hologram (aka the holohamm) Enlarge Image A new algorithm can visually discern malignant skin lesions from less dangerous ones. Stanford/Matt Young Artificial intelligence that diagnoses skin cancer as well as a dermatologist could one day rest in the palm of your hand. A team from the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory set up a machine-learning AI to teach itself to diagnose cancer by looking at skin lesions just as a doctor would during an exam. The team tested the algorithm against 21 board-certified dermatologists, and it performed just as well as its human counterparts. "We realized it was feasible, not just to do something well, but as well as a human dermatologist," Sebastian Thrun, an adjunct professor in the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, said in a statement. "That's when our thinking changed. That's when we said, 'Look, this is not just a class project for students, this is an opportunity to do something great for humanity.'" Thrun is perhaps better known as one of the founders of both Udacity and Google X. A paper on the system co-authored by him and his colleagues appeared in the journal Nature Wednesday. 17 How Hollywood sees AI, in 16 films The researchers envision making the algorithm compatible with smartphones, putting skin cancer diagnosis into the hands of just about anyone anywhere. "Early detection is critical, as the estimated five-year survival rate for melanoma drops from over 99 percent if detected in its earliest stages to about 14 percent if detected in its latest stages," the paper reads. "We developed a computational method which may allow medical practitioners and patients to proactively track skin lesions and detect cancer earlier." The AI is a convolutional neural network, the same type of system Google uses to wallop masters of the ancient game Go. The researchers used one of Google's AI systems -- the GoogleNet Inception v3 CNN architecture, which had already been taught to visually identify different objects. But it hadn't yet been trained to tell the difference between a malignant carcinoma and a harmless skin lesion, so the team pulled together a dataset to transform the neural network into a digital dermatologist. 'Farsighted' looks on the technological bright side of 2016 (Farsighted, Ep 3) Not everyone loved 2016, but we could look back on it as the year we made real progress toward living longer, better and perhaps even on Mars. by Eric Mack 51:04 Close Drag More from the future Dr. Google may check your eyes in the future Artificial intelligence has a big year ahead 2016 wasn't so bad: 5 ways this year will shape the future "There's no huge dataset of skin cancer that we can just train our algorithms on, so we had to make our own," said Brett Kuprel, co-lead author of the paper and a graduate student in the Thrun lab. "We gathered images from the internet and worked with the medical school to create a nice taxonomy out of data that was very messy -- the labels alone were in several languages, including German, Arabic and Latin." The coders collaborated with dermatologists and others in the medical field on the project. "Advances in computer-aided classification of benign versus malignant skin lesions could greatly assist dermatologists in improved diagnosis for challenging lesions and provide better management options for patients," said Susan Swetter, professor of dermatology and co-author of the paper. "However, rigorous prospective validation of the algorithm is necessary before it can be implemented in clinical practice, by practitioners and patients alike."

Apple aims to up its AI smarts with iCloud user data in iOS 10.3 Posted 18 hours ago by Natasha Lomas (@riptari) 0 SHARES Next Story Daimler close to buying Taxibeat in Greece for around $43M The next version of Apple’s mobile platform will include an opt-in for iOS users to share their iCloud data in order to help the company improve software products, such as its voice-powered virtual assistant, Siri. The iOS 10.3 beta was released earlier this week. A note about the forthcoming change, under the heading “iCloud Analytics & Privacy”, says any user data shared with Apple via this opt in will undergo “privacy preserving techniques” — continuing its privacy-first approach to stepping up its AI efforts. One of the most interesting changes in 10.3 – Apple will use differential privacy on iCloud user data to improve services (opt-in) pic.twitter.com/NKqrTee8Fq — Federico Viticci (@viticci) January 24, 2017 The company has generally lagged behind data-mining rivals such as Google in developing machine learning powered technologies and embedding them into its software and services to offer a more personalized and/or predictive experience, in no small part because it has prioritized (and championed) user privacy — meaning, unlike its major rivals, Apple does not routinely suck up users’ personal data in the clear. And while that’s great from a privacy stand point — and allows Apple to differentiate its hardware business from rivals such as Google that do rely on factory-farming user data to power their ad-targeting business models — the company has been facing increasing competitive pressure from rivals when it comes to developing software that makes use of machine learning and AI to offer a more personalized experience to users. With hardware sales growth slowing there’s also increasing pressure on Cupertino to innovate in services, which means it needs to be offering smarter, predictive and personalized products powered by machine learning. The problem is for AI to function it needs to be fed on data. Apple’s workaround for what some have argued is a convenience vs privacy impasse is to apply a level of obfuscation to the raw user data, in order to protect individuals’ privacy, only taking this fuzzier data off to its cloud for analyzing (in bulk) to enable it to draw some broad-brush conclusions about usage trends. Apple discussed one obfuscation technique it’s using — called differential privacy — back in June at WWDC, and says now this is one of the ways it will be processing any iCloud user-data that it gains access to after iOS 10.3. At WWDC, Apple senior VP of software engineering Craig Federighi described the result of the algorithmic scrambling technique as akin to “crowdsourced learning”. Although it’s not clear how successful it’s been thus far — in terms of making a noticeable difference to the convenience and ‘delight’ of Apple services for its users. We’ve reached out to the company with questions about the forthcoming expansion of its AI efforts and will update this post with any additional detail. The first Apple services to gain AI-powered enhancements via the application of differential privacy techniques were: iMessage, with keyboard data used to power features such as next word and emoji predictions, and also flag up linguistic changes such as rising slang terms or trendy new words; Spotlight Search, with analytics on bulk user data enabling Apple to flag popular deep link searches to better rank search results; and Notes, where the technique has enabled more interactivity, such as underlining actionable info such as dates — to power things like calendar event creation suggestions. These were also the first three services it targeted to be a source of user data to apply its AI algorithms to. In iOS 10.3 Apple is aiming to expand its access to user data via its cloud storage and back-up service, iCloud, though not (at least explicitly) to improve iCloud itself — rather it says it will be using insights gleaned there to help it improve its Siri voice assistant (among other unnamed services). It notes that users can opt out of sharing their iCloud data at any time — a welcome and sensible check, not least because some iCloud users do pay for extra storage. With Siri, Apple is likely hoping that bulk iCloud data analysis can help it improve voice recognition capabilities — and perhaps also enhance the results served up by the voice assistant, by improving Siri’s ability to make selections/suggestions based on popular user queries. While Apple was an early mover in the voice assistant space when it originally launched Siri, it’s now very fiercely contested territory, with all major tech giants having an offering — and analysts spying increasing user appetite for voice-driven offerings. Having access to good data is clearly key to improving AI assistant smarts. iCloud users can sync all sorts of data to Apple’s cloud storage service — from their calendar, email, notes, reminders, photos and contacts, to Safari bookmarks and even choose to back up messaging content from apps such as WhatsApp — so there’s a very wide range of data and data types Apple could draw on here to try to make Siri (and other services) smarter. While other tech companies have been experimenting with, and even applying, differential privacy techniques — including Google, via its RAPPOR project — Apple’s push on this front appears to be considerably broader. “It is probably fair to say that Apple is the first to integrate differentially private algorithms so comprehensively into their products and to use it as a differentiator,” is how Adam Smith, a long time researcher in the field and associate professor in the Computer Science and Engineering Department at Pennsylvania State University, described the companies efforts back in June. “I would imagine they will want to use the [iCloud] data for all sorts of things, from improving Siri suggestions to devising which new products to deploy and even much more technical things like what type of data compression to use,” Smith says now. “Basically, the more information they have about how people use their service, the better they can adapt it to accomplish particular goals (serve their customers, extract revenue, etc).” Today it was also confirmed Apple has formally joined a raft of other tech firms in signing up to an AI research partnership that aims to help further socially beneficial artificial intelligence, likely by conducting research into areas such as AI ethics — a topic which is attracting increasing attention as autonomous technologies proliferate.

Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Facebook, IBM, and Google-owned British AI firm DeepMind last year established the non-profit organization, called "Partnership on AI," which will have its inaugural board meeting in San Francisco on February 3. Apple "has been involved and collaborating with the partnership since before it was first announced and is thrilled to formalize its membership," the alliance said in an online post. Major technology firms joined forces in the group, with stated aims including cooperation on "best practices" for AI and using the technology "to benefit people and society." Creation of the group came amid concerns that new artificial intelligence efforts could spin out of control and end up being detrimental to society. The companies "will conduct research, recommend best practices, and publish research under an open license in areas such as ethics, fairness, and inclusivity; transparency, privacy, and interoperability; collaboration between people and AI systems; and the trustworthiness, reliability, and robustness of the technology," according to a statement. Internet giants have been investing heavily in creating software to help machines think more like people, ideally acting as virtual assistants who get to know users and perhaps even anticipate needs. SpaceX founder and Tesla chief executive Elon Musk in 2015 took part in creating nonprofit research company OpenAI devoted to developing artificial intelligence that will help people and not hurt them. Musk found himself in the middle of a technology world controversy by holding firm that AI could turn on humanity and be its ruin instead of a salvation. A concern expressed by Musk was that highly advanced artificial intelligence would be left to its own devices, or in the hands of a few people, to the detriment of civilization as a whole. People joining tech company executives on the Partnership board included Dario Amodei of Open AI along with members of the American Civil Liberties Union; the MacArthur Foundation, and the University of California, Berkeley.

Daniel Sparks (TMFDanielSparks) Jan 27, 2017 at 1:05PM Highlighting a somewhat muted response from investors, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock is trading about 0.4% lower at the time of this writing on Friday after the company reported its results for the fourth quarter of 2016. While revenue jumped 22% to $26.1 billion and surpassed analysts' consensus estimate (via Thomson Reuters) for revenue of $25.2 billion, the company's earnings of $9.36 per share fell short of a projection for $9.64. As investors digest the information from Alphabet's latest report, here's a look at some of the most insightful comments from the company's fourth-quarter earnings call. In these quotes, management discusses the success of the new Google-branded hardware, further opportunity in advertising, and what it considers the three biggest bets for the company beyond its core ad business. Google Pixel. Image source: Google. Alphabet's core search business hasn't peaked -- far from it After pointing to the company's impressive 20% consolidated revenue growth in 2016, which management emphasized is actually 24% when excluding the impact of currency headwinds, Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat emphasized (via a Reuters transcript) the opportunity ahead: This performance is a testament to the ongoing innovation that is driving our success in mobile search, YouTube, and programmatic advertising, each of which we believe has only begun to scratch the surface. We remain excited about the sizable opportunities that have not yet been tapped. These could become major revenue drivers With about 86% of Alphabet's total revenue coming from advertising, it's always nice to get an update on whether the company is seeing success on diversifying its revenue sources. To this end, Alphabet made excellent progress in its fourth quarter. Here's what Porat had to say: Alongside these [advertising] businesses, we are focused on growing additional revenue streams within Google over the medium- and long-term. In 2016, our other revenue line grew 41% on a full year basis reflecting the growth in our Play, hardware and cloud businesses. We see tremendous potential ahead for these businesses, as well as in the continued development of non-advertising revenue streams for YouTube. We're investing in our cloud and hardware businesses, as well as our newer non-ad revenue sources for YouTube, in order to accelerate their progress as major revenue drivers for Google in the next several years. Alphabet's other revenue growth in the Google segment (not to be confused with Alphabet's "other bets") was even more impressive in the company's fourth quarter specifically. Fourth-quarter other revenue soared 62% year over year, to $3.4 billion, accounting for 13% of total revenue, up from 10% of revenue in the year-ago quarter. Management cited hardware, the Google Play app store, and its cloud business as key drivers for the segment. Google Home. Image source: Google. Google-branded hardware looks promising Drilling down more narrowly on the company's nascent hardware business, which received some extra attention from the company in the fourth quarter when Google launched its voice-activated smart speaker (Google Home) and a new smartphone (Google Pixel), management was optimistic about how new hardware is performing in the marketplace. Google CEO Sundar Pichai explained: We introduced a new family of beautiful hardware devices in October that are made by Google, led by Google Home and our Pixel phone which feature the Google Assistant built in. We're thrilled with the reception, as well as the really happy customers we saw over the holiday season. In particular, Google Home was a very popular present that many people opened on Christmas morning. We have committed to this for the long-term, as a great way to bring a beautiful seamless Google experience to people. The early signs are promising, and you can expect us to see us expand our offerings thoughtfully. Alphabet's three big bets Pichai said that beyond its core advertising business, the company distinctly views "YouTube, cloud and hardware" as "three of our biggest bets." So investors should keep an eye on these areas as Alphabet continues to grow its business. Management's extreme confidence in incremental opportunity in Alphabet's core search business, along with significant and promising growth in YouTube, cloud, and hardware, continues to make a great case for owning this stock. Not only is the company strengthening the competitive position of its core business, but it's also diversifying its revenue while simultaneously opening the doors to meaningful opportunities beyond advertising.

Head of Design Departs HTC to Join Google Daydream Division GO Claude Zellweger is known for designing the HTC One flagship Jan 27, 2017 18:32 GMT  ·  By Andrei Vlad  ·  Share:  It looks like Google and Facebook managed to tap two high-profile executives working for major smartphone companies. In a surprising move, Xiaomi's VP Hugo Barra announced earlier this week that he would be joining Facebook's Oculus VR team. Today, HTC's Head of Design Claude Zellweger announced he already departed the Taiwanese company to join Google's Daydream division. The information has since been confirmed by HTC as well. “HTC can confirm that Claude Zellweger has left the Company. We appreciate his considerable contribution to HTC, and wish him well in his future endeavors. HTC continues to invest in talent and recruitment as part of our broader strategy to ensure the continued strength and integrity of the company's organizational structure.” Claude Zellweger and Scott Croyle are the men responsible for the design of the original HTC One smartphone, the same design that's been cloned to some degree into most flagships the Taiwanese company has since released on the market. Moreover, Zellweger led the team that built the HTC Vive, which is probably one of the reasons he's been tapped by Google to work for its VR division. HTC One Interestingly, sources told Engadget that Claude Zellweger left HTC back in July 2015, but agreed on a grace period, just like CEO Peter Chou in 2015. It's unclear if Zellweger influenced the design of the current HTC flagship, the U Ultra, or its mid-range counterpart, the U Play. Moving forward, Daniel Hundt will be leading HTC's smartphone design division, but as far as Vive project goes, that's a completely different subsidiary that works independently. Is it a coincidence that two important execs coming from smartphone businesses took jobs in the VR world? We believe Google and Facebook have invested a lot in their Daydream and Oculus projects to back down, so it might be that the future of VR looks bright at the moment.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (2 Images) #Claude Zellweger#HTC One#HTC U Ultra#HTC Vive#Google Daydream subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Photo Gallery (2 Images) 01 02 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google Brings Tango Augmented Reality Technology to Museums Google Adds More Phones to Daydream Family Including Asus ZenFone AR, ZTE Axon 7 First Press Render of the Asus ZenFone AR Tango-Enabled Smartphone Leaked Out Tango-Enabled Asus ZenFone AR Smartphone Inadvertently Confirmed by Qualcomm Windows 10 Mobile Start Screen vs. iOS Home Screen: Beauty and the Beast Let’s Chat: With or Without an Antivirus in Windows 10?

Yet Amazon's surprise success sets up a long-term battle with Apple and Alphabet Google for primacy in the connected household. And the contours of that competition are following a classic tech industry dynamic. Amazon's surprise success with its Echo speakers and Alexa smart assistant sets up a long-term battle with Apple and Alphabet Google for primacy in the connected household. Amazon is pursuing an open-systems approach that allows quick development of many features, while Apple is taking a slower route, asserting more control over the technology in order to assure security and ease-of-use. The strategic importance of the 'connected home' niche looms large: Amazon wants a way to own its customer interactions -mainly shopping online - without an Apple phone or a Google Web browser as an intermediary. Apple needs to keep the iPhone at the center of customers' lives, and has built a whole home automation architecture, called Homekit, into its smartphone.

Share this article Share Google, for its part, is investing heavily in both intelligent assistant software and home-automation devices like the Nest thermostats and, more recently, the Google Home speaker.  But Google is behind in the race, with its speaker only hitting the market in November and compatible with a handful of gadgets beyond Nest and Dropcam, which the company also owns. 'When the iPhone rolled out in 2007, everyone developed for that. Right now, everyone is developing for the voice-activated Internet,' said Mark Mahaney, an analyst and managing director with RBC Capital Markets. Mahaney estimates Amazon sold as many as 10 million Alexa-enabled devices over the holiday season. Google hasn't disclosed sales for its Home speaker. Apple has declined to comment on reports that it has a voice-activated speaker in the works. The final revamped feature shown for iOS was the Home app, which delivers a simple and secure way to setup, manage and control your home. Users can access and inateract with all their automated home products, no matter who makes them HOW HOMEKIT WORKS  Opening the Home app brings up a main screen that lists all favourite Scenes and favourite accessories for quick access.  Each accessory can be controlled individually by pressing on its name to bring up a set of options. You can also create scenes, such as 'Leaving home' that turns off the lights, locks your doors, and lowers the thermostat — all with one command. You can set up products to trigger each other based on an additional condition, such as setting your bathroom heater to turn on at 6:00 a.m. but only when you're home.  Siri can also listen for voice commands. Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said the company is leading the industry by being the first to integrate home automation into a major platform with iOS 10.  'The number of HomeKit-compatible accessories continues to grow rapidly with many exciting solutions announced just this month,' she said. For the smart home, the key developer partners are the makers of household devices ranging from lighting systems to refrigerators.  There are currently about 250 devices that are certified to work with Alexa, and Amazon has encouraged rapid development of third-party applications with its open-systems approach and even financial incentives for some partners. Apple's Homekit, by contrast, has about 100 certified devices.  And the reasons behind that gap show both the risks and the potential rewards of Apple's approach. HOW APPLE EXERTS CONTROL To be Homekit-certified, gadget makers must include special chips to work with Apple's system. Developers that order small volumes of the chips say they can cost an 50 cents to $2, though prices are lower for larger buyers. Apple also requires developers to buy specific WiFi and Bluetooth networking chips that cost more than competitors. The devices have to be made in special factories that are certified by Apple. A confidential Apple document obtained by Reuters lists more than 800 of these factories, but only a few specialize in home automation products. Developers can ask Apple to certify an unlisted factory they want to use. But the limited selection means that device makers can't always get the best prices or work with their preferred factories. The founder of one startup that considered pursuing HomeKit approval for a device that helps control home temperatures said the company picked a factory with 40,000 employees that was making well known 'Star Wars' toys, but it couldn't use that factory for HomeKit products. 'They're a huge company, a legitimate manufacturer that makes tech household brands. And yet they're not certified,' said the founder, who declined to speak on the record because of non-disclosure agreements with Apple. Manufacturers also have to send product samples to Cupertino, where Apple tests them extensively for compatibility. The whole process can take three to five months. During that time, device makers aren't allowed to say publicly that they're pursuing HomeKit certification. Some developers say it's worth it. 'They found issues with our product before we released it that we didn't find in our testing,' said Gimmy Chu, CEO of Nanoleaf, a smart lighting system. 'We know that after we have the certification that it's rock solid.' AMAZON'S 'OPEN' APPROACH Amazon's Echo has been a huge hit Alexa, by contrast, only requires smart home companies to write software code and submit it to Amazon for review.  There are no special chips. To earn the 'Works with Alexa' label -which isn't required to function with Alexa but does help promote products on Amazon's website - startups must have their products physically tested. Amazon does allow that to happen in a third-party lab, however. Once those certifications are in hand, Amazon says it will decide whether or not a device gets the 'Works with Alexa' label within 10 days. Apple's approach has some clear advantages when it comes to privacy, security and ease-of-use. HomeKit gadgets, for example, can operate without being connected to the Internet. (An iPad or Apple TV connected to the Internet is required if you want to control devices when you're outside the house.) 'It also makes for a better user experience,' notes Ahmed Abdallah, a senior engineer at Incipio, which makes HomeKit-compatible devices such as electrical outlets. 'You'll experience some latency if you're always having to bounce off the cloud' as with Alexa. Apple also has an advantage around setup. iPhone owners open up the Home app and set up a device with just a few taps. With Alexa, customers have to download the gadget's companion app first, set up the device, then add a 'skill' to Alexa in the Alexa app. PHILIPS HUE - THE $60 SMART LIGHTS  The Philips hue system is the market-leader in smart lighting for the home.  The $129  starter kit comprises three bulbs and a unit called a 'bridge', that connects your lights to your wifi system, allowing you to control the lights with your iOS or Android smartphone or tablet. If you want to really go to town, you can add up to 50 more bulbs.  Philips $129 starter kit, with two bulbs, a bridge and a switch. As well as being able to control the lights, you can also make the lights respond in certain ways to certain events. For example, if your football team scores, the lights could be programmed to flash.  Or if you get an email from your children, the lights could change colour.  Philips makes a range of lamps for the system, even including bedside lamps like this one The lights can also double as an alarm, and even automatically turn on when you return home.  The firm also recently unveiled a new motion sensor which can work with HomeKit to trigger scenes when you walk in, for instance. It also makes everything from strips of LED lights to physical dimmer switches that can be easily programmed to work with HomeKit.  Apple's ease of setup lured in some big brands like Hunter Fan Company, the top-selling ceiling fan maker in the U.S. 'If that experience isn't good, it has a strong negative halo on the brand because customers just assume the product is bad,' said John Neilson, the company's chief marketing officer. Amazon acknowledges that unlike Apple, it can't guarantee the security of third-party devices. A company spokeswoman did note that sensitive commands like unlocking doors have an extra layer of security such as a voice-controlled PIN. Still, it's not clear whether Apple's elaborate but slow-to-develop system will have enough advantages to overcome Amazon's widening lead. 'The danger I see for Apple and the home is they're assuming that because I have a smartphone that may be an Apple device, that alone is enough of a Trojan horse to establish their mindshare,' said Andreas Stavropoulos, a partner at venture capital firm DFJ. 'I wouldn't say that's certain yet.' REMOTE DOORS LOCKS: THE AUGUST LOCK The firm also makes a 'doorbell cam' The August lock is made of durable anodized aluminum and is fitted to an existing door look in about 10 minutes.  It can then be managed using a mobile or Apple Watch app and online. August works with any Bluetooth-enabled smartphone, although the apps are only available on iOS and Android, and its laterst version adds HomeKit capabilities. To open the lock, anyone with a code can approach the door, enable their phone's Bluetooth and press the relevant address from the app.  Or, swipe and tap their Apple Watch. To open the lock, anyone with a code can approach the door, enable their phone or watch's Bluetooth and press the relevant address from the app. An exploded view of the lock is shown To grant keyless access to friends the homeowner must send them an invite using Facebook contacts or their phone's address book. When someone enters or leaves the house a notification is sent to the owner. The lock automatically closes after 10 seconds to secure the door.  Share or comment on this article e-mail 8 shares Most watched News videos 'There goes that relationship' Trump's quip to BBC question Graphic: NZ Breakers player's eye dislodged in horrific injury Pizza Hut customer finds workers in the back of empty restaurant in Bristol Shocking CCTV shows car speed into Humber Bridge barrier Heartwarming scene as Grayce shares her puppies with owner Florida couple passed out in their car with two children in the backseat A close look at the huge crack formed across Arizona desert Bizarre footage of multiple UFOs hovering near Mexican border Enraged man punches laptop and quits job during 'meltdown' at airport Alarming moment guy violently pushes man onto tube tracks CCTV shows brave man fighting nunchuck-wielding robbers Inauguration etiquette 101: Escort First Lady up White House steps First ladies first?

Currently, only a handful of newer devices include access to the Play Store. Google introduced the Play Store running on Chromebooks last year. It lets you download and run Android apps on compatible Chrome OS devices, giving you access to millions more apps than the Chrome Web Store contains. Not every Android app will scale well to a laptop's display but most popular titles run as expected. This week, Google made a widely anticipated announcement that all Chromebooks launching in 2017 onwards will support Android apps out of the box. This will enable many more buyers to use the feature and make Chromebooks able to handle a wider workload. Android apps are only available on three devices today, the 2015 Google Chromebook Pixel, Acer Chromebook Flip and Acer Chromebook R11. In addition, Google has confirmed that many older Chromebooks will receive software updates adding support for the Play Store. Devices on the list include popular models from Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo and Samsung. Older laptops are unlikely to ever see the feature though, locking them out of Chrome OS' next major step. "While we won't be able to bring Android apps to every Chromebook ever made, we're continuing to evaluate more devices based on a range of factors, like processor type, GPU, and drivers," said Google. Unsupported devices will continue to receive regular software updates as scheduled. Google promises five years of updates for each Chromebook from its initial launch date. It warns that not all features of new releases will be available on every model, as in the case of the Play Store. There is a way to bypass this limitation and install the Play Store on any Chromebook. However, it isn't officially supported and could stop working after a future update. It involves running multiple commands in the terminal and is only suitable for users comfortable with the environment. Google's announcement this week was followed by the launch of two new education-focused Chromebooks from Acer and Asus. Education has proved to be one of Chrome OS' major strengths, to the extent that over half of all education PCs are now Chromebooks. The expansion of the Play Store to every new model will allow Google to continue expanding its presence in schools. Teachers will now be able to access a wider range of software, including apps students are already using on their phones. The wealth of material in the Play Store can be brought into lessons in a secure, sandboxed environment. Schools can create libraries of pre-approved Android apps that students can install. Access to the rest of the Store is then automatically blocked. "We believe in the power of technology to help students learn how they learn best and teachers teach the way they find most effective," said Naveen Viswanathan, Product Manager of Google for Education. "We’ll continue to work with educators in 2017 to build tools that support the important work they do every day." The addition of the Play Store also makes Chromebooks a more feasible option for people who need to work productively on the go. The arrival of Android apps brings new functionality and additional offline options to Chrome OS, making it a more versatile computing platform.

The new version, Chrome v56, is due to be rolled out over the next few days and weeks, the company said. The change behind the faster loading speeds has to do with the way the browser validates information when reloading a page. In addition to being faster, the new behavior also results in up to 60 percent fewer validation requests, which should also help save on bandwidth and power, two major concerns for enterprise users, according to Google. Simplified Reload Behavior "When reloading a page, browsers will check with the web server if cached resources are still usable, a process known as validation," Takashi Toyoshima wrote on Google's Chromium blog yesterday. "This typically results in hundreds of network requests per page issued to dozens of domains. On mobile devices, the high latency and transient nature of mobile connections mean that this behavior can produce serious performance issues." Toyoshima said that users typically reload either because pages are broken or the content seems stale. Chrome’s existing reload behavior usually solves broken pages, but stale content is inefficiently addressed by a regular reload, especially on mobile devices. "This feature was originally designed in times when broken pages were quite common, so it was reasonable to address both use cases at once," Toyoshima said. However, this original concern has now become far less relevant as the quality of Web pages has increased. To improve the stale content use case, Chrome now has a simplified reload behavior to only validate the main resource and continue with a regular page load. This new behavior maximizes the reuse of cached resources and results in lower latency, power consumption and data usage, according to Google. The company said it worked with both Facebook and Mozilla, the company behind the open-source Firefox browser, to develop the faster validation behavior. HTTP Warnings for Banking Web sites Faster speeds are not the only improvement in the new Chrome version. Version 56 will also include 51 different security fixes for the Windows, macOS and Linux operating systems to help make the browser safer to use. Among the fixes is a new tool that will flag pages that collect information about banks and accounts using the HTTP protocol, rather than the more secure HTTPS protocol. Chrome users will see a label reading "Not Secure" in the address bar to hammer the point home. Firefox, which worked with Chrome on the security fix, will also be introducing a similar feature as it rolls out its next update. In addition, the new Chrome version adds Web Bluetooth API support on Android, Chrome OS, and macOS to make it possible for sites to interact with low-energy Bluetooth devices.

What's 2016's Most Used Password? Next Article > Saudi Arabia Warns Destructive Computer Virus Has Returned By Jon Gambrell PUBLISHED: JANUARY 25 2017 Saudi Arabia is warning that a computer virus that destroyed systems of its state-run oil company in 2012 has returned to the kingdom, with at least one major petrochemical company apparently affected by its spread. Suspicion for the initial dispersal of the Shamoon virus in 2012 fell on Iran as it came after the Stuxnet cyberattack targeting Tehran's contested nuclear enrichment program. It wasn't immediately clear who could be responsible for the new infection, though the relations between regional rivals remain tense. A report Monday by Saudi state-run television included comments suggesting that 15 government agencies and private institutions had been hit by the Shamoon virus, including the Saudi Labor Ministry. The ministry said it was working with the Interior Ministry to contain the virus. Sadara, a joint venture between the Saudi Arabian Oil Co. and Michigan-based Dow Chemical Co., shut down its computer network Monday over a disruption. Company spokesman Sami Amin said its network remained down Tuesday, though it hadn't affected operations at the facility. He declined to comment further. Sadara is based in Jubail Industrial City, which sits about 100 kilometers (60 miles) northwest of the eastern Saudi city of Dammam in the heartland of the kingdom's oil industry. The $20 billion facility, inaugurated by Saudi King Salman in late November, includes 26 manufacturing units that will produce more than 3 million metric tons of plastics and chemical products. Another state-run TV report on Tuesday said the Saudi Technical and Vocational Training Corp. was affected, though a spokesman denied the virus did any damage to its network. Symantec Corp., a California-based security firm, warned in late November that Shamoon had been spotted again in Saudi Arabia. Computers affected had their hard drives erased and displayed a photograph of the body of 3-year-old Syrian boy Aylan Kurdi, who drowned fleeing his country's civil war, Symantec said. "Why Shamoon has suddenly returned again after four years is unknown," Symantec said . "However, with its highly destructive payload, it is clear that the attackers want their targets to sit up and take notice." The November attacks apparently involved previously stolen passwords. Symantec on Monday said the outbreak might be linked to a group it called Greenbug, which previously attacked targets in Bahrain, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Turkey with emails carrying malicious attachments. Shamoon, named for a folder in its code, first emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2012. In that attack, which hit Saudi Aramco and Qatari natural gas producer RasGas, the virus deleted hard drives and then displayed a picture of a burning American flag on computer screens. The attack forced Saudi Aramco to shut down its network and destroyed over 30,000 computers. "All told, the Shamoon virus was probably the most destructive attack that the private sector has seen to date," then-U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said at the time. Shortly before Panetta's speech, a former U.S. official told The Associated Press that American officials firmly believed Iranian hackers likely backed by Tehran were responsible for the attack. Iran denied being responsible for the 2012 Shamoon outbreak. Tehran had no immediate comment on the new outbreak. The first emergence of Shamoon came as Iran faced international sanctions over its contested nuclear program and after it saw thousands of centrifuges destroyed by the Stuxnet virus, widely believed to be an American and Israeli creation. Last year, a series of fires at Iranian petrochemical plants and facilities have raised suspicions about hacking potentially playing a role. Hostilities persist between Shiite power Iran and Sunni-ruled Saudi Arabia. The countries support opposite sides in the wars gripping Syria and Yemen, while the kingdom has backed Bahrain's Sunni rulers amid a crackdown on dissent on the Shiite-majority island. Saudi Arabia severed diplomatic relations with Iran last year after protesters there ��" angry about its execution of a Shiite cleric ��" stormed two Saudi diplomatic posts. © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

Google Dance returns to SMX West in March Subscribe to SearchCap SUBSCRIBE SEO SEM Mobile Local Retail Google Bing Social Home SEM No fluff - just the best news in paid search marketing every week. SUBSCRIBE The essential guide to pharma SEM Columnist Justin Freid explains the basics of getting your PPC campaigns up and running in the highly regulated industry of prescription drug advertising. Justin Freid on January 26, 2017 at 12:21 pm More One out of every 20 searches on Google is health-related. That means that many of us are heading to Dr. Google before heading to see our primary care physician. What the searchers do not see is the complex set of rules, regulations and processes that many pharmaceutical companies must go through to leverage paid search. Though most are familiar with the FDA’s role in deciding which medications are approved for use, many are not aware that it also oversees advertising for prescription drugs. The United States is one of the few countries that allow direct-to-consumer advertising for pharmaceutical drugs, and the FDA plays a key role in making sure any type of advertising by pharmaceutical brands is accurate and not deceptive. It also ensures that any claims made are backed up with information about the potential side effects or risks. For an SEM campaign to be launched, a strict set of rules must be followed. Many of the rules come from the FDA’s guidance on Reminder Ads, while others are set by legal and regulatory teams within the specific pharmaceutical companies. FDA guidance overview The FDA has extensive advertising guidance for prescription drugs, some of which is applicable to SEM. The issue is, some points within the guidance are interpreted differently by individual pharma companies because guidelines are general enough to apply to multiple forms of advertising (display creative, SEM creative). That means that, as new and innovative forms of advertising are created, the guidance from the FDA is often applied to these new opportunities, even if it does not fit exactly. (Editor’s Note: the legal information provided in this column is just that — legal information, and not legal advice.) Following are some FDA guidelines and how they apply to SEM. Fair balance FDA regulations require that pharmaceutical ads provide a “fair balance” of information on both a drug’s risks and its benefits. According to the FDA website, “This means that the content and presentation of a drug’s most important risks must be reasonably similar to the content and presentation of its benefits.” This is why, at the end of TV commercials for prescription drugs, you often hear that long list of side effects and risks. This is meant to counterbalance the information given about the drug’s effectiveness in treating a condition — because an ad cannot place greater emphasis on benefits than it does on risks. Reminder ads  The FDA’s definition of reminder ads is as follows: Reminder ads give the drug’s name but not the drug’s use. The assumption behind reminder ads is that the audience knows what the drug is for and does not need to be told.  A reminder ad does not contain risk information about the drug because the ad does not discuss the condition treated or how well the drug works. In other words, reminder ads avoid the need for “fair balance” of information because they contain neither benefits nor risks — just the name of the drug, which serves as a “reminder” for consumers who are already familiar with it. These ads cannot explain — or even suggest — what the drug does, what disease it treats, what the recommended dosage is, or how well the drug works; however, they do not have to include any risk information about the drug, either. These ads must mention the drug’s brand name (if applicable) and its generic name. Because of character limits in search text ads, this guidance is often applied. Here is an example of what a reminder ad would look like: As mentioned above, this ad falls under the reminder ad guidance because it contains the drug’s brand name but does not address the disease or condition it treats. If it did, “fair balance” would apply, and the risks would need to be disclosed. This obviously is not possible, as it would be significantly longer than standard text ad character limits. It is important to note that the reminder ad guidance is not directed solely at SEM efforts and is applicable to many forms of advertising. Space limitations The FDA has also published guidance regarding “Internet/Social Media Platforms With Character Space Limitations.” This guidance can also potentially be applied to search text ads and in some ways contradicts the reminder ad policy. This guidance restates that if a brand chooses to disclose a benefit, then the risk information must follow. However, it also explains that if there are not enough characters to allow the full set of risk information, then the risks must be listed in order of seriousness. Here is the specific section addressing this: At a minimum, a firm should communicate the most serious risks associated with the product together with the benefit information within the individual character-space-limited communication. Throughout the document, the FDA states that if the pharmaceutical company feels they cannot accurately present risk information in the allotted space, they should reconsider showing their brand name and benefit information in that specific ad unit. When this guidance is applied to a text ad, it could potentially resemble the following: Many pharmaceutical companies are not comfortable leveraging this within paid search efforts and do not use this format. Almost all companies ensure text ads stay within the reminder ad guidance mentioned above. Paid search for ‘black box’ drugs A boxed warning appears on a prescription drug label for any drug that has a serious risk associated with it. If a drug happens to have a side effect that could cause death, addiction or serious injury, it is often labeled as “black box.” (Note: Advertisers are not allowed to use reminder ads for “black box” drugs.) For many years, Google and Bing both had specific ad formats for black box drugs. This included an additional line of text, similar to current call-out extensions, that said: “Click to see full safety and prescribing information, including boxed warning. More info.” The “more info” part of the ad would link to the important safety information (ISI) page on the brand website. This ad format was not accessible within the AdWords or Bing Ads interface and needed to be set up by Google or Bing reps. This ad format was done away with in mid-2015. Now many brands with boxed warnings utilize similar text within their description lines and drive users to a page that contains ISI information. An example of what a black box ad may look like is as follows: Changes to Vanity URL usage for pharma advertisers As mentioned above, the FDA requires you to list risk information if you call out the disease or condition the drug treats within a text ad. This caused the pharmaceutical industry some problems with trying to make a text ad relevant to a search query. If someone searched for heart failure medication and you wanted to include the term “heart failure medication” within your ad, you wouldn’t be able to unless you either disclosed the risks or removed the drug’s brand name. With both Google and Bing showing the destination URL within ads — which was often branded — this caused a big issue for brand ads. To circumvent this issue, both Google and Bing previously allowed pharma brands to utilize Vanity URLs. These essentially were unbranded URLs that redirected to a brand website. For example, www.heartfailuremeds.com would redirect to www.brand.com. This way, the ad would not show the brand name but would show www.heartfailuremeds.com instead. This practice, of course, is against regulations for all advertisers outside of pharma. In early 2016, Google did away with this option, as they called out the practice as deceptive to searchers. Now, advertisers can utilize a select set of “display URL options.” Currently, pharma advertisers can choose from the following within AdWords: This was a hot topic within the SEM community in 2016, as many PPC experts were surprised Google was allowing advertisers to execute something that is not available to any other industry. The legal review process Every pharmaceutical company has an internal legal and regulatory team responsible for reviewing myriad materials. From websites and in-office pamphlets to videos and SEM ads, all marketing materials go through a rigorous review process. One potential issue agencies run into is how different companies, and even different reviewers within the same company, interpret FDA guidance. A process or approach to text ads that works for one client may not be acceptable for another. As a best practice, working alongside legal and regulatory teams to ensure you understand their internal processes while also helping educate them on the specific channel you manage can help make the process as smooth as possible. Working with the engines Getting a new pharma SEM campaign off the ground is tough enough when you have to jump through the legal and regulatory hoops, but there are extra steps that must be taken with the search engines as well. Unfortunately, you cannot just set up a new campaign and get it up and running right away. When flagged as a pharmaceutical brand, the website that traffic is driving to must be whitelisted internally at the engines to qualify for a campaign to go live. Without this, ads will be disapproved immediately. Thankfully, both Bing and Google have dedicated teams that fully understand the pharmaceutical rules and regulations. Similar to other industries, spend is a factor of receiving dedicated support. In some certain cases, smaller startup pharmaceutical companies with low or no historic spend will have to utilize the AdWords Hotline to get their campaigns up and running.

A new report claims to shed some light on next year’s Pixel devices. The next Pixel is rumored to feature upgrades such as water-resistance, improved camera and a faster processor. Google is testing several versions of their upcoming smartphone, alleges a source close to 9to5Google. For fans with a budget, the high-end Google smartphone is getting a cheaper version. The device is allegedly referred to as the “Pixel 2B,” a less powerful version designed for emerging markets. Google is prioritizing the camera once again and Pixel 2 will reportedly come with an even better camera than the original. The source claims the company is putting more work into improving low-light photography. Google, however, is not adding any more megapixels, but the sensor will “compensate in extra features.” Water-resistance for the Pixel 2 is “still on the table,” states a CNET report. It sounds like a waterproof Pixel 2 isn’t 100% sure. With major flagships like LG G6 and Galaxy S8 coming with water-resistance features, it will be a huge disappointment for users. Pixel 2 Specs list and Price Though not finalized, multiple Pixel 2 prototypes are being evaluated featuring multiple chipsets. Unsurprising on the list is a Snapdragon 83x, which is possibly Snapdragon 835 SoC or a modified version. Google is believed to be also testing processors from Intel and Taiwanese chipset manufacturer MediaTek. Finally, the report predicts that the added features and upgrades will add on to the price of the final product. The premium smartphone is expected to have a small price hike of $50. As for the pricing of  the cheaper “Pixel 2B,” details are still unclear. In the meantime, major South Korean tech firms are close to releasing their flagships–the Galaxy S8 and the LG G6 at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona next month. The Galaxy S8 is said to come with bezel-less infinite display, Snapdragon 835 SoC, dual camera, new AI assistant “Bixby” and more. The LG G6, on the other hand, is adopting a metallic build and water-resistant design with a powerful dual camera. Other than that, the leak hasn’t revealed any of the other Pixel 2 features and specifications. Of course, it is still too early to confirm anything for sure.

Here are the first few things you need to do Yesterday GOOG: 823.31 -8.84 Opinion: The Huawei Mate 9 is the best Android alternative to Google’s Pixel XL Ben Schoon - Jan. 27th 2017 9:45 am PT @NexusBen Feature Android Google Pixel XL Huawei Mate 9 View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit I love the Google Pixel. Since the day I bought it I’ve been a fan of almost everything about it and even recommended it to some close friends. Despite how good the Pixel is, though, it’s important to remember that it’s not the only great Android smartphone on the market. There are several others that are fantastic, and I’m lucky enough to have gotten my hands on most of them. After spending time with almost every major flagship smartphone released in the past several months, I can easily say that my favorite option that’s not the Pixel, is the Huawei Mate 9… Taking a step back, let’s look at what makes the Pixel so great. Some might say its pure software, others might say its hardware, and still others will say its camera. Realistically, the measurement most people use for what makes a good phone is the culmination of a few different factors: the performance, camera, battery life, and ease of use, all compared to how much the phone costs. The Pixel scores high in each category — it’s a fast, powerful smartphone with great battery life and an outstanding camera sensor. However, it’s really how all of those factors come together that makes the Pixel so great. All of that said, why is the Mate 9 the “runner-up” to the Pixel? Why would a phone from a Chinese manufacturer mainly known for how bad its software has been be the best device (at least in my opinion), outside of the Pixel? Because it truly is that good. Software & Performance Some people measure a manufacturer’s skin on Android based on how similar it is to what Google would hope Android to be. In some ways, that’s a good method. Google’s version of Android is clean, easy to use, and works great, but that doesn’t mean it should be the only option. The problems we’ve seen over the last several years have come with OEMs changing Google’s software in the wrong way. For years, that’s what Huawei has had an issue with. The company had adjusted Google’s Android so much, it turned into a horrible clone of iOS. It was slow, riddled with bugs, and just… terrible. That’s not the case with EMUI 5.0. This version of Huawei’s skin is cleaner, faster, and easier to use than any version before. I’ve been using the Mate 9 side-by-side with the Pixel for nearly 3 months now, and I can honestly say that I enjoy using the software on the Mate 9 just as much as I do the Pixel. That’s not to say it’s without fault, though. Huawei still has some work to do in cleaning up the Mate’s software, primarily when it comes to the battery saving features and its infmaous bloatware. There are a few apps on the Mate 9 which feel completely unnecessary, a few which legitimately shouldn’t be there (seriously why are there two SIM toolkit apps that don’t actually do anything?) and until I finally deactivated it, the power-saving notifications drove me just a bit crazy. All of that said, though, I can say EMUI 5.0 is my favorite take on Android software that’s available right now. Hardware Smartphone design over the past year or so has gotten pretty stale, and there’s nowhere that’s more evident than with the Pixel. It feels like an iPhone clone that’s trying to be different, but failing. The build is good, yes, but it’s nothing I’d call attractive. Of course, the software and performance are the main attractions on the Pixel, but hardware is an important aspect of any device. On the other hand, the Huawei Mate 9 has a very attractive metal build, especially in the gray color I’ve been using for the past month or so. The curved back of the device combined with the rounded edges and curved glass feels fantastic, and the slim bezels on all fronts don’t hurt matters at all (yes I’m talking to you enormous Pixel chin). Those slim bezels also help the Mate 9 feel a bit more compact than it actually is. Despite having a 5.9-inch display, the Mate isn’t too much bigger than the Pixel XL. Camera One area where the Mate loses to the Pixel is in the camera department. The Mate does pack a solid dual-camera system, but it just doesn’t match up to what the Pixel is capable of, both in stills and in video. The primary difference shows itself in low-light. Outdoor shots in decent lighting are basically identical on these two phones, but indoors there’s a clear difference in quality. The Pixel XL has better detail and sharpness, as well as better colors. The Pixel’s camera results are just second to none, and there’s no way to argue that. The Mate 9 definitely has a better camera app, offering a solid balance of simplicity and features. The interface is easy to use in auto mode, but you can easily access the pro functions with a quick swipe, and there are over a dozen different shooting modes available. The Pixel, on the other hand, essentially has a couple of modes and a shutter button. Shot on Pixel XL Shot on Mate 9 Shot on Pixel XL Shot on Mate 9 Battery Life Battery life is a strong point for many large phones, but it becomes especially apparent on the Pixel XL and Mate 9. The XL easily gets me through a day on a charge, where the Mate can get through one, perhaps even two on medium usage. It’s a tight battle between the two here, and I’ve been fully satisfied on both. The Mate, though, especially impressed me with its ridiculously fast charging which fills up the 4,000 mAh battery in what feels like minutes. Value When it comes down to it, the Mate 9 isn’t a perfect phone. But, neither is the Pixel. Google has come as close as ever to a perfect Android device with the Pixel, but perfection comes at a cost. The minimum you’ll pay for a Pixel is $649 plus taxes and extra fees, and that’s just for the smaller 5-inch model. The XL starts at a whopping $769, and ranges as high as over $1,000 depending on the configuration you buy and including all the various fees associated. Meanwhile, the Mate 9 runs just $599 for a device which, in all reality, only somewhat lags behind the Pixel in terms of the camera, software, and display resolution. It runs on top of similar specifications — a powerful chipset and 4GB of RAM paired with Android Nougat and plenty of storage. In the case of the Pixel, you get a Snapdragon 821, where Huawei’s device runs on top of its in-house Kirin 960 processor. So overall, you aren’t losing any power, you’re just changing its source to an extent. There is the extra plus in the Mate 9, though, of having 64GB of storage out of the box and a microSD card slot available. The base Pixel XL, on the other hand, only comes with 32GB of storage without a way to expand that. If you can afford a Pixel XL, yes, it’s probably the better phone, but if you can’t, I honestly think the Mate 9 is your best bet. It ships with a current Android version with one of the best skins I’ve ever used, and offers an overall experience that is simply excellent. You can pick up the Mate 9 at Amazon.

Here are the first few things you need to do Yesterday GOOG: 823.31 -8.84 You can now edit images, insert headers, and more in Google Docs for Android Justin Duino - Jan. 27th 2017 9:55 am PT @jaduino Android Google Docs View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Google is currently rolling out an update to Google Docs on Android which gives you a lot more editing power when working on documents while mobile. These include the ability to resize, move, and rotate images, drag and drop text, and even insert headers and footers straight from your phone or tablet… Introduced on Google’s G Suite website, these updates coming to Docs makes it just a little bit easier to edit your files when you aren’t sitting at an actual computer. The new image editing tools can be found in a newly introduced “Image” tab. This should appear when you have an image selected. Here, you can also add or customize a border around your photograph. Dragging and dropping text is just as simple and it sounds. Simply highly the words or sentences that you would like to move, tap down on it, and drag it to your desired location. If you would like to add a header or footer, all you have to do is tap in the upper or lower part of the display. While tricky to achieve on a small smartphone display, when it does work, a light line will appear separating the body text from the new sections. In addition to the changes coming to the Docs application for Android, Google Docs for iOS (iPhone and iPad) is also getting its own share of feature updates. These include the ability to insert headers and footers, inserting page numbers in the headers and footers, and the ability to change a page’s size, orientation, and color. Google Sheets for iOS will also be updated with the ability to add and edit solid, dashed, and dotted borders. This Google Docs update is currently rolling out to users now but if you don’t want to wait, you can head on over to APKMirror to download the latest APK.

SUBSCRIBE The essential guide to pharma SEM Columnist Justin Freid explains the basics of getting your PPC campaigns up and running in the highly regulated industry of prescription drug advertising. Justin Freid on January 26, 2017 at 12:21 pm More One out of every 20 searches on Google is health-related. That means that many of us are heading to Dr. Google before heading to see our primary care physician. What the searchers do not see is the complex set of rules, regulations and processes that many pharmaceutical companies must go through to leverage paid search. Though most are familiar with the FDA’s role in deciding which medications are approved for use, many are not aware that it also oversees advertising for prescription drugs. The United States is one of the few countries that allow direct-to-consumer advertising for pharmaceutical drugs, and the FDA plays a key role in making sure any type of advertising by pharmaceutical brands is accurate and not deceptive. It also ensures that any claims made are backed up with information about the potential side effects or risks. For an SEM campaign to be launched, a strict set of rules must be followed. Many of the rules come from the FDA’s guidance on Reminder Ads, while others are set by legal and regulatory teams within the specific pharmaceutical companies. FDA guidance overview The FDA has extensive advertising guidance for prescription drugs, some of which is applicable to SEM. The issue is, some points within the guidance are interpreted differently by individual pharma companies because guidelines are general enough to apply to multiple forms of advertising (display creative, SEM creative). That means that, as new and innovative forms of advertising are created, the guidance from the FDA is often applied to these new opportunities, even if it does not fit exactly. (Editor’s Note: the legal information provided in this column is just that — legal information, and not legal advice.) Following are some FDA guidelines and how they apply to SEM. Fair balance FDA regulations require that pharmaceutical ads provide a “fair balance” of information on both a drug’s risks and its benefits. According to the FDA website, “This means that the content and presentation of a drug’s most important risks must be reasonably similar to the content and presentation of its benefits.” This is why, at the end of TV commercials for prescription drugs, you often hear that long list of side effects and risks. This is meant to counterbalance the information given about the drug’s effectiveness in treating a condition — because an ad cannot place greater emphasis on benefits than it does on risks. Reminder ads  The FDA’s definition of reminder ads is as follows: Reminder ads give the drug’s name but not the drug’s use. The assumption behind reminder ads is that the audience knows what the drug is for and does not need to be told.  A reminder ad does not contain risk information about the drug because the ad does not discuss the condition treated or how well the drug works. In other words, reminder ads avoid the need for “fair balance” of information because they contain neither benefits nor risks — just the name of the drug, which serves as a “reminder” for consumers who are already familiar with it. These ads cannot explain — or even suggest — what the drug does, what disease it treats, what the recommended dosage is, or how well the drug works; however, they do not have to include any risk information about the drug, either. These ads must mention the drug’s brand name (if applicable) and its generic name. Because of character limits in search text ads, this guidance is often applied. Here is an example of what a reminder ad would look like: As mentioned above, this ad falls under the reminder ad guidance because it contains the drug’s brand name but does not address the disease or condition it treats. If it did, “fair balance” would apply, and the risks would need to be disclosed. This obviously is not possible, as it would be significantly longer than standard text ad character limits. It is important to note that the reminder ad guidance is not directed solely at SEM efforts and is applicable to many forms of advertising. Space limitations The FDA has also published guidance regarding “Internet/Social Media Platforms With Character Space Limitations.” This guidance can also potentially be applied to search text ads and in some ways contradicts the reminder ad policy. This guidance restates that if a brand chooses to disclose a benefit, then the risk information must follow. However, it also explains that if there are not enough characters to allow the full set of risk information, then the risks must be listed in order of seriousness. Here is the specific section addressing this: At a minimum, a firm should communicate the most serious risks associated with the product together with the benefit information within the individual character-space-limited communication. Throughout the document, the FDA states that if the pharmaceutical company feels they cannot accurately present risk information in the allotted space, they should reconsider showing their brand name and benefit information in that specific ad unit. When this guidance is applied to a text ad, it could potentially resemble the following: Many pharmaceutical companies are not comfortable leveraging this within paid search efforts and do not use this format. Almost all companies ensure text ads stay within the reminder ad guidance mentioned above. Paid search for ‘black box’ drugs A boxed warning appears on a prescription drug label for any drug that has a serious risk associated with it.

For many years, Google and Bing both had specific ad formats for black box drugs. This included an additional line of text, similar to current call-out extensions, that said: “Click to see full safety and prescribing information, including boxed warning. More info.” The “more info” part of the ad would link to the important safety information (ISI) page on the brand website. This ad format was not accessible within the AdWords or Bing Ads interface and needed to be set up by Google or Bing reps. This ad format was done away with in mid-2015. Now many brands with boxed warnings utilize similar text within their description lines and drive users to a page that contains ISI information.

The legal review process Every pharmaceutical company has an internal legal and regulatory team responsible for reviewing myriad materials.

Can it try again for the next one? 9to5Mac reports that hopes for better ingress protection are “still on the table” at this relatively late stage. That’s according to one source that previously said that the feature would be a “definite” on a Pixel sequel. What kind of priorities in features, design and engineering take over at Google will tell the story for the next device. For example, the so-called “Pixel 2” is also said to be amping up optic hype with a specific focus on low-light camera abilities. That means a relatively low megapixel count, but compensation in “extra features.” If HTC, the company that manufactured the Pixel, is being brought on to reprise its role for the Pixel 2, we’ll see if we’re dealing with “UltraPixel” quality, here. While device specifics are still in the development cycle, it is believed that said cycle includes several test devices with chipsets developed in-house and from Qualcomm, Intel and MediaTek — products from the latter of the three has been discarded from consideration. Testing is ongoing. A “Pixel 2B” is also in the brainstorm and prototype stage that would lower the specification and price bar for a full-on Google experience in targeted regions (think emerging markets). This device would be launched either with or after the Pixel 2’s debut. Pricing for the Pixel 2 is expected to start from at least $699 while the “2B” is only told to be “significantly cheaper” than that. We are months away from launch, but we definitely have a learning base to develop from with this missive. Advertisement likethis What's your reaction?

Yet Amazon's surprise success sets up a long-term battle with Apple and Alphabet Google for primacy in the connected household. And the contours of that competition are following a classic tech industry dynamic. Amazon's surprise success with its Echo speakers and Alexa smart assistant sets up a long-term battle with Apple and Alphabet Google for primacy in the connected household. Amazon is pursuing an open-systems approach that allows quick development of many features, while Apple is taking a slower route, asserting more control over the technology in order to assure security and ease-of-use. The strategic importance of the 'connected home' niche looms large: Amazon wants a way to own its customer interactions -mainly shopping online - without an Apple phone or a Google Web browser as an intermediary. Apple needs to keep the iPhone at the center of customers' lives, and has built a whole home automation architecture, called Homekit, into its smartphone.

Microsoft's market value tops $500 BILLION for the first... Panasonic introduces service ROBOTS to Tokyo Narita Airport... Share this article Share Google, for its part, is investing heavily in both intelligent assistant software and home-automation devices like the Nest thermostats and, more recently, the Google Home speaker.  But Google is behind in the race, with its speaker only hitting the market in November and compatible with a handful of gadgets beyond Nest and Dropcam, which the company also owns. 'When the iPhone rolled out in 2007, everyone developed for that. Right now, everyone is developing for the voice-activated Internet,' said Mark Mahaney, an analyst and managing director with RBC Capital Markets. Mahaney estimates Amazon sold as many as 10 million Alexa-enabled devices over the holiday season. Google hasn't disclosed sales for its Home speaker. Apple has declined to comment on reports that it has a voice-activated speaker in the works. The final revamped feature shown for iOS was the Home app, which delivers a simple and secure way to setup, manage and control your home. Users can access and inateract with all their automated home products, no matter who makes them HOW HOMEKIT WORKS  Opening the Home app brings up a main screen that lists all favourite Scenes and favourite accessories for quick access.  Each accessory can be controlled individually by pressing on its name to bring up a set of options. You can also create scenes, such as 'Leaving home' that turns off the lights, locks your doors, and lowers the thermostat — all with one command. You can set up products to trigger each other based on an additional condition, such as setting your bathroom heater to turn on at 6:00 a.m. but only when you're home.  Siri can also listen for voice commands. Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said the company is leading the industry by being the first to integrate home automation into a major platform with iOS 10.  'The number of HomeKit-compatible accessories continues to grow rapidly with many exciting solutions announced just this month,' she said. For the smart home, the key developer partners are the makers of household devices ranging from lighting systems to refrigerators.  There are currently about 250 devices that are certified to work with Alexa, and Amazon has encouraged rapid development of third-party applications with its open-systems approach and even financial incentives for some partners. Apple's Homekit, by contrast, has about 100 certified devices.  And the reasons behind that gap show both the risks and the potential rewards of Apple's approach. HOW APPLE EXERTS CONTROL To be Homekit-certified, gadget makers must include special chips to work with Apple's system. Developers that order small volumes of the chips say they can cost an 50 cents to $2, though prices are lower for larger buyers. Apple also requires developers to buy specific WiFi and Bluetooth networking chips that cost more than competitors. The devices have to be made in special factories that are certified by Apple. A confidential Apple document obtained by Reuters lists more than 800 of these factories, but only a few specialize in home automation products. Developers can ask Apple to certify an unlisted factory they want to use. But the limited selection means that device makers can't always get the best prices or work with their preferred factories. The founder of one startup that considered pursuing HomeKit approval for a device that helps control home temperatures said the company picked a factory with 40,000 employees that was making well known 'Star Wars' toys, but it couldn't use that factory for HomeKit products. 'They're a huge company, a legitimate manufacturer that makes tech household brands. And yet they're not certified,' said the founder, who declined to speak on the record because of non-disclosure agreements with Apple. Manufacturers also have to send product samples to Cupertino, where Apple tests them extensively for compatibility. The whole process can take three to five months. During that time, device makers aren't allowed to say publicly that they're pursuing HomeKit certification. Some developers say it's worth it. 'They found issues with our product before we released it that we didn't find in our testing,' said Gimmy Chu, CEO of Nanoleaf, a smart lighting system. 'We know that after we have the certification that it's rock solid.' AMAZON'S 'OPEN' APPROACH Amazon's Echo has been a huge hit Alexa, by contrast, only requires smart home companies to write software code and submit it to Amazon for review.  There are no special chips. To earn the 'Works with Alexa' label -which isn't required to function with Alexa but does help promote products on Amazon's website - startups must have their products physically tested. Amazon does allow that to happen in a third-party lab, however. Once those certifications are in hand, Amazon says it will decide whether or not a device gets the 'Works with Alexa' label within 10 days. Apple's approach has some clear advantages when it comes to privacy, security and ease-of-use. HomeKit gadgets, for example, can operate without being connected to the Internet. (An iPad or Apple TV connected to the Internet is required if you want to control devices when you're outside the house.) 'It also makes for a better user experience,' notes Ahmed Abdallah, a senior engineer at Incipio, which makes HomeKit-compatible devices such as electrical outlets. 'You'll experience some latency if you're always having to bounce off the cloud' as with Alexa. Apple also has an advantage around setup. iPhone owners open up the Home app and set up a device with just a few taps. With Alexa, customers have to download the gadget's companion app first, set up the device, then add a 'skill' to Alexa in the Alexa app. PHILIPS HUE - THE $60 SMART LIGHTS  The Philips hue system is the market-leader in smart lighting for the home.  The $129  starter kit comprises three bulbs and a unit called a 'bridge', that connects your lights to your wifi system, allowing you to control the lights with your iOS or Android smartphone or tablet. If you want to really go to town, you can add up to 50 more bulbs.  Philips $129 starter kit, with two bulbs, a bridge and a switch. As well as being able to control the lights, you can also make the lights respond in certain ways to certain events. For example, if your football team scores, the lights could be programmed to flash.  Or if you get an email from your children, the lights could change colour.  Philips makes a range of lamps for the system, even including bedside lamps like this one The lights can also double as an alarm, and even automatically turn on when you return home.  The firm also recently unveiled a new motion sensor which can work with HomeKit to trigger scenes when you walk in, for instance. It also makes everything from strips of LED lights to physical dimmer switches that can be easily programmed to work with HomeKit.  Apple's ease of setup lured in some big brands like Hunter Fan Company, the top-selling ceiling fan maker in the U.S. 'If that experience isn't good, it has a strong negative halo on the brand because customers just assume the product is bad,' said John Neilson, the company's chief marketing officer. Amazon acknowledges that unlike Apple, it can't guarantee the security of third-party devices. A company spokeswoman did note that sensitive commands like unlocking doors have an extra layer of security such as a voice-controlled PIN. Still, it's not clear whether Apple's elaborate but slow-to-develop system will have enough advantages to overcome Amazon's widening lead. 'The danger I see for Apple and the home is they're assuming that because I have a smartphone that may be an Apple device, that alone is enough of a Trojan horse to establish their mindshare,' said Andreas Stavropoulos, a partner at venture capital firm DFJ. 'I wouldn't say that's certain yet.' REMOTE DOORS LOCKS: THE AUGUST LOCK The firm also makes a 'doorbell cam' The August lock is made of durable anodized aluminum and is fitted to an existing door look in about 10 minutes.  It can then be managed using a mobile or Apple Watch app and online. August works with any Bluetooth-enabled smartphone, although the apps are only available on iOS and Android, and its laterst version adds HomeKit capabilities. To open the lock, anyone with a code can approach the door, enable their phone's Bluetooth and press the relevant address from the app.  Or, swipe and tap their Apple Watch. To open the lock, anyone with a code can approach the door, enable their phone or watch's Bluetooth and press the relevant address from the app. An exploded view of the lock is shown To grant keyless access to friends the homeowner must send them an invite using Facebook contacts or their phone's address book. When someone enters or leaves the house a notification is sent to the owner. The lock automatically closes after 10 seconds to secure the door.  Share or comment on this article e-mail 8 shares Most watched News videos 'There goes that relationship' Trump's quip to BBC question Graphic: NZ Breakers player's eye dislodged in horrific injury Pizza Hut customer finds workers in the back of empty restaurant in Bristol Shocking CCTV shows car speed into Humber Bridge barrier Heartwarming scene as Grayce shares her puppies with owner Florida couple passed out in their car with two children in the backseat A close look at the huge crack formed across Arizona desert Bizarre footage of multiple UFOs hovering near Mexican border Enraged man punches laptop and quits job during 'meltdown' at airport Alarming moment guy violently pushes man onto tube tracks CCTV shows brave man fighting nunchuck-wielding robbers Inauguration etiquette 101: Escort First Lady up White House steps First ladies first?

REUTERS/Bobby Yip/Files    5447343 Tesla filed a lawsuit against a former high-level employee Thursday, accusing the staff member of stealing confidential data and trying to shepherd other employees towards another self-driving startup he was developing. The tech conglomerate alleges in an official criminal complaint that Sterling Anderson violated his contract “by attempting to recruit at least a dozen Tesla engineers, taking Tesla’s confidential and proprietary information, and doctoring and destroying evidence in an effort to cover his tracks — all for the benefit of a competing venture he launched while still a Tesla employee.” Anderson served as the director of autopilot programs for over a year. (RELATED: Elon Musk Says Autopilot Death Probably Wouldn’t Have Happened With Latest Updates) Christopher Urmson, the former CTO of Google’s self-driving initiative, was also named in the lawsuit. Urmson announced his resignation from Google in August. Anderson allegedly downloaded “hundreds of gigabytes” of proprietary and secret information. He apparently handed back the original documents when he was fired, but not the copies of the files he created. Anderson is also accused of colluding with Urmson, who started his own self-driving car company Aurora. Specifically, Tesla says that Urmson would contact Tesla engineers on behalf of Anderson, while Anderson would contact Google engineers on behalf of Urmson. (RELATED: Big Tech Always Ends Up With Big Lawsuits) Anderson “wiped his company-issued iPhone, purging not only Tesla-related materials that he was required to return upon the end of his employment but also text messages and phone records evidencing his unlawful solicitation of Tesla employees. He erased files from his company-issued laptop,” the legal complaint reads. (RELATED: Tesla Poaches 11-Year Veteran At Apple To Speed Up Autopilot Tech Development) Urmson, though, vehemently argues that the lawsuit is based on false accusations. “Tesla’s meritless lawsuit reveals both a startling paranoia and an unhealthy fear of competition,” Urmson said in a statement, according to Recode Thursday. “This abuse of the legal system is a malicious attempt to stifle a competitor and destroy personal reputations. Aurora looks forward to disproving these false allegations in court and to building a successful self-driving business.” A highly similar situation unfolded in November after Zynga, a social video game service, sued two former employees and its main rival for allegedly taking secret data to the other company.

The largest solar photovoltaic project in South America has started supplying electricity to Google. Acciona Energia has announced that it has started to supply electricity to Google’s installations in Chile from the El Romero solar power project. The 246 megawatt project is the largest solar PV power plants in South America. Acciona Energina had signed a contract to the supply of 80 megawatts (MW) of power to Google’s data center in Quilicura through the Central Interconnected System. Quilicura is one of the 13 Google data centers worldwide and the only one located in the Southern hemisphere. The power supply agreement will be in place at least until 2030, with an option to extend it by five years. “We are proud to supply renewable energy to such an important customer as Google, a company strongly committed to renewables. And to do it from this plant, the biggest photovoltaic installation in Latin America and a key reference within the sector,” says ACCIONA Energía Chile CEO José Ignacio Escobar. Florencia Bianco, Google Corporate Communications Manager for Latin America, points out that “in 2017 Google will achieve the objective of supplying its global operations with 100% renewable energy. El Romero is a very important element in achieving this objective.” In November of last year, Acciona announced that it commissioned a 246 MW solar project in the Atacama region of Chile. The El Romero solar project was successfully linked to the Central Interconnected System following 13 months of construction. The project is spread across 280 hectares and consists of 776,000 modules. The project required a total investment of $343 million. Around 500 gigawatt-hours of electricity generated from the project every year would be enough to power 250,000 homes in Chile and offset around 485,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emission every year.   Reprinted with permission.

Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Facebook, IBM, and Google-owned British AI firm DeepMind last year established the non-profit organization, called "Partnership on AI," which will have its inaugural board meeting in San Francisco on February 3. Apple "has been involved and collaborating with the partnership since before it was first announced and is thrilled to formalize its membership," the alliance said in an online post. Apple is the latest tech giant to join the non-profit "Partnership on AI," which will have its inaugural board meeting in San Francisco on February 3 ©Eric Thayer (GETTY/AFP/File) Major technology firms joined forces in the group, with stated aims including cooperation on "best practices" for AI and using the technology "to benefit people and society." Creation of the group came amid concerns that new artificial intelligence efforts could spin out of control and end up being detrimental to society. The companies "will conduct research, recommend best practices, and publish research under an open license in areas such as ethics, fairness, and inclusivity; transparency, privacy, and interoperability; collaboration between people and AI systems; and the trustworthiness, reliability, and robustness of the technology," according to a statement. Internet giants have been investing heavily in creating software to help machines think more like people, ideally acting as virtual assistants who get to know users and perhaps even anticipate needs. SpaceX founder and Tesla chief executive Elon Musk in 2015 took part in creating nonprofit research company OpenAI devoted to developing artificial intelligence that will help people and not hurt them. Musk found himself in the middle of a technology world controversy by holding firm that AI could turn on humanity and be its ruin instead of a salvation. A concern expressed by Musk was that highly advanced artificial intelligence would be left to its own devices, or in the hands of a few people, to the detriment of civilization as a whole. People joining tech company executives on the Partnership board included Dario Amodei of Open AI along with members of the American Civil Liberties Union; the MacArthur Foundation, and the University of California, Berkeley.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    In less than a year, Amazon's combination of the Echo speaker system and the Alexa voice-controlled digital assistant has come close to delivering on the elusive promise of easy-to-use technology that can control gadgets in the home with a few spoken words. Yet Amazon.com Inc.'s surprise success sets up a long-term battle with Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google for primacy in the connected household. And the contours of that competition are following a classic tech industry dynamic. Amazon is pursuing an open-systems approach that allows quick development of many features, while Apple is taking a slower route, asserting more control over the technology in order to assure security and ease-of-use. The strategic importance of the "connected home" niche looms large: Amazon wants a way to own its customer interactions -mainly shopping online - without an Apple phone or a Google Web browser as an intermediary. Apple needs to keep the iPhone at the center of customers' lives, and has built a whole home automation architecture, called Homekit, into its smartphone. Google, for its part, is investing heavily in both intelligent assistant software and home-automation devices like the Nest thermostats and, more recently, the Google Home speaker. But Google is behind in the race, with its speaker only hitting the market in November and compatible with a handful of gadgets beyond Nest and Dropcam, which the company also owns. "When the iPhone rolled out in 2007, everyone developed for that. Right now, everyone is developing for the voice-activated Internet," said Mark Mahaney, an analyst and managing director with RBC Capital Markets. Mahaney estimates Amazon sold as many as 10 million Alexa-enabled devices over the holiday season. Google hasn't disclosed sales for its Home speaker. Apple has declined to comment on reports that it has a voice-activated speaker in the works. Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said the company is leading the industry by being the first to integrate home automation into a major platform with iOS 10. "The number of HomeKit-compatible accessories continues to grow rapidly with many exciting solutions announced just this month," she said. For the smart home, the key developer partners are the makers of household devices ranging from lighting systems to refrigerators. There are currently about 250 devices that are certified to work with Alexa, and Amazon has encouraged rapid development of third-party applications with its open-systems approach and even financial incentives for some partners. Apple's Homekit, by contrast, has about 100 certified devices. And the reasons behind that gap show both the risks and the potential rewards of Apple's approach. HOW APPLE EXERTS CONTROL To be Homekit-certified, gadget makers must include special chips to work with Apple's system. Developers that order small volumes of the chips say they can cost an 50 cents to $2, though prices are lower for larger buyers. Apple also requires developers to buy specific WiFi and Bluetooth networking chips that cost more than competitors. The devices have to be made in special factories that are certified by Apple. A confidential Apple document obtained by Reuters lists more than 800 of these factories, but only a few specialize in home automation products. Developers can ask Apple to certify an unlisted factory they want to use. But the limited selection means that device makers can't always get the best prices or work with their preferred factories. The founder of one startup that considered pursuing HomeKit approval for a device that helps control home temperatures said the company picked a factory with 40,000 employees that was making well known "Star Wars" toys, but it couldn't use that factory for HomeKit products. "They're a huge company, a legitimate manufacturer that makes tech household brands. And yet they're not certified," said the founder, who declined to speak on the record because of non-disclosure agreements with Apple. Manufacturers also have to send product samples to Cupertino, where Apple tests them extensively for compatibility. The whole process can take three to five months. During that time, device makers aren't allowed to say publicly that they're pursuing HomeKit certification. Some developers say it's worth it. "They found issues with our product before we released it that we didn't find in our testing," said Gimmy Chu, CEO of Nanoleaf, a smart lighting system. "We know that after we have the certification that it's rock solid."   AMAZON'S "OPEN" APPROACH Alexa, by contrast, only requires smart home companies to write software code and submit it to Amazon for review. There are no special chips. To earn the "Works with Alexa" label -which isn't required to function with Alexa but does help promote products on Amazon's website - startups must have their products physically tested. Amazon does allow that to happen in a third-party lab, however. Once those certifications are in hand, Amazon says it will decide whether or not a device gets the "Works with Alexa" label within 10 days. Apple's approach has some clear advantages when it comes to privacy, security and ease-of-use. HomeKit gadgets, for example, can operate without being connected to the Internet. (An iPad or Apple TV connected to the Internet is required if you want to control devices when you're outside the house.) "It also makes for a better user experience," notes Ahmed Abdallah, a senior engineer at Incipio, which makes HomeKit-compatible devices such as electrical outlets. "You'll experience some latency if you're always having to bounce off the cloud" as with Alexa. Apple also has an advantage around setup. iPhone owners open up the Home app and set up a device with just a few taps. With Alexa, customers have to download the gadget's companion app first, set up the device, then add a "skill" to Alexa in the Alexa app. Apple's ease of setup lured in some big brands like Hunter Fan Company, the top-selling ceiling fan maker in the U.S. "If that experience isn't good, it has a strong negative halo on the brand because customers just assume the product is bad," said John Neilson, the company's chief marketing officer. Amazon acknowledges that unlike Apple, it can't guarantee the security of third-party devices. A company spokeswoman did note that sensitive commands like unlocking doors have an extra layer of security such as a voice-controlled PIN. Still, it's not clear whether Apple's elaborate but slow-to-develop system will have enough advantages to overcome Amazon's widening lead. "The danger I see for Apple and the home is they're assuming that because I have a smartphone that may be an Apple device, that alone is enough of a Trojan horse to establish their mindshare," said Andreas Stavropoulos, a partner at venture capital firm DFJ. "I wouldn't say that's certain yet." © 2017 Thomson/Reuters. All rights reserved. Click Here to comment on this article Close  More ways to share...

It’s called the Pixel – the Pixel XL, in this context – and it is utterly amazing Rating:  5 Typical Price:  £719.00 Pros:  Excellent Camera; Insane Battery Performance; Brilliant Software; Great Call Quality; Zero Lag; No Bloatware; Google Assistant ROCKS Cons:  The Price; The Design Is A Tad Dull Verdict:  The software is amazing. The camera is stunning. The battery life is beyond belief. You get free storage for ALL your pictures and videos. Google offers 24/7 round the clock support, meaning any issues can be resolved right away, and Google Assistant is the smartest Personal Assistant available inside a phone right now. If you love Android, buy this phone. If you want market-leading battery performance and a brilliant camera, buy this phone. Nothing else compares. I used to be a Nexus purist. Not anymore. Now I am a Pixel purist. facebook twitter google+ While a decent chunk of the Nexus line, Google's Old Guard, is being supported in terms of software updates, officially the Nexus brand is no more. It's been replaced, by the new Pixel brand formed by the two new Pixel and Pixel XL handsets co-developed with HTC. So what's the story here? Well essentially it's business as usual; like the Nexus series, the Pixel and Pixel XL have been designed and put together by HTC but under the close and watchful eye of Google. As before, it's intended as a showcase of the latest version of Android (Nougat) and its capabilities - raw, pure, and unadulterated as Google intended it, with no glossy overlays or anything of that sort. It's also supposed to be a perfect, optimised union of software and hardware running as efficiently as possible, sort of like Google's equivalent to Apple's iPhone; carefully controlled and precision engineered. However, this is arguably where the Pixel starts to outpace the old Nexus line-up. Where the Nexus series was largely a favourite of smartphone afficionados and techy types who love to tinker, side-load, develop their own software, and generally futz around with their own little bespoke tech universe, the Pixel is intended, again like the iPhone, to have mass consumer appeal. It's a bit tidier, a bit sexier, and a bit more polished. Part of this is in going furter with the bespoke features that ONLY Pixel handsets will feature, things like a very advanced implementation of the Google Assistant AI. Other phones may make use of Google Assistant, but none will be so closely merged into the Android experience as on the Pixel. Google has confirmed that, like the Nexus series, the new Pixel phones will be officially supported with the latest Android software updates for two years after launch, with three years of support for security patches. On Google's "Check & update your Android version" page, the company details that Android support will last for the current gen of Pixel phones until October 2018. "Pixel phones get Android version updates for at least 2 years from when the device became available on the Google Store. After 2 years, we can't guarantee additional updates." So, does the Google Pixel XL do enough to earn its place at the head of the table? Google Pixel XL Review: Design A lot has been said about the design of the Pixel phones. Most of it not good. The visuals are pretty pedestrian. There’s nothing too eye-catching or impressive about either handset. The only real point of interest is the two-tone paneling work on the back of the device. Beyond this it just looks like a phone. Not a bad-looking phone, but nothing particularly exciting either. But this isn’t what the Pixel XL is about. Well, that’s my opinion, anyway. I think this phone about Android and nothing else. Everything on the front, save for the annoyingly large bezels, is designed to simply get out of the way and let you get stuck into Android’s guts and features. I’m not a huge fan of the design, basically, but then again I don’t like the way the PS4 looks but that hasn’t exactly stopped me from using it. google-pixel-vs-iphone-7 The Pixel XL is fairly large at 75.7 x 154.7 mm. It felt even larger to me as I came into this review from an iPhone SE. Still, I’m pretty used to using phablets as they have been my phone of choice for years, so it didn’t take long to re-adjust. I like that Google put the fingerprint scanner on the back again and I also like that it didn't get rid of the headphone jack. Beyond this the rest of the phone is pretty much as it looks in pictures: big, shiny and not all that interesting. The two Pixel phones are more or less identical with respect to core specs as well. The smaller Pixel has a 1080p display, a smaller battery but same internal specs and hardware and, importantly, the same camera and imaging capabilities. I like this aspect of Google’s Pixel campaign; Apple’s iPhones are too different these days and the reason for this is very simple: Apple wants you to buy the more expensive model, which, for all intents and purposes, is the vastly superior model as well. Rather than take this approach, Google has opted to keep things simple: at its core the choice between the two Pixel phones depends on your preference on size. After this, other considerations include battery performance; the XL model’s battery performance is a lot better than the smaller model, for instance. The only real downside to these phones, if you could call it a downside, is their all too pedestrian styling. They’re not eye-catching phones, nor do they look like expensive phones either. They're smart enough, don’t get me wrong, it just doesn't have the majesty of Samsung's Galaxy S7 EDGE or the uniqueness of the Nexus 6P. It still functions perfectly in the hand and it still feels premium. It’s just not particularly eye-catching, though, for me, this isn’t exactly a deal breaker. I’m more concerned with the software, cameras, and performance. Google Pixel XL Review: What About The Google Pixel? Is there any difference between Google’s new handsets, save for the size of the actual phone? No – none whatsoever. The Pixel is exactly the same handset with exactly the same internal spec, save for batteries – the Pixel XL’s is larger. The only REAL difference you will notice is the display size and resolution; the smaller Pixel handset has a 5in AMOLED panel with a 1080p resolution. Full HD might sound disappointing to some, but it’s worth remembering that equates to a pixel density of 441 ppi. The Pixel XL has great battery life, but the smaller Pixel, thanks to its less-power-hungry display, is even better. Light users could potentially get two day’s worth of use from a single charge. Last time I checked, that was considered very impressive and it trumps just about everything else on market in this regard, proving once again that having full control over software and hardware, as Google does with these phones, yields very impressive performance results, indeed. Like the Pixel XL, there is no MicroSD support on the smaller Pixel handset. Ditto OIS in the camera. For the price, Google should have included OIS and also made the handset water-proof. The latter aspect is by far one of the Pixel range’s biggest goofs. I mean even Apple’s iPhones are now water proof! The company has taken a lot of flack for this aspect too, though, speaking personally, I don’t actually view either as a deal-breaker. Sure, OIS in water-proofing would have been a nice inclusion on a handset this expensive, but the omission doesn’t really detract from the overall performance of these phones in a day to day setting. Also: I think most of us are now conditioned, through years and years of phone use, not to drop out handsets in bodies of water. I know I am. Google Pixel XL Review: Display The Pixel XL packs in an AMOLED QHD display that is bright, punchy and vivid. Google has not scrimped on anything in this regard and using the Pixel XL, day in, day out, is an absolute pleasure. At 5.5in it is well inside phablet territory like Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus, its nearest rival, and like Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus the handset itself is more than a handful. Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus is still only 1080p, however, and this is where the Pixel XL steams ahead because not only is it using screen technology – AMOLED – that Apple will use next year, it has has a higher resolution and this makes looking at anything on it a vastly superior experience, regardless of Apple’s command of the colour gamut aboard its latest handsets. I’m not too fussed about 1080p vs QHD, if I'm 100% honest. I’ve been using the iPhone SE for months now and pretty much enjoyed most of my time with it. QHD is great when you have it, but it is not a necessity – especially if it comes at the expense of battery performance. Normally this is the case. However, Google has managed to remedy this via some sort of black magic, ensuring market-leading battery performance from the Pixel XL. For me, this is a game-changer. Not only do you have a supremely bright and detailed display, but you also have INSANE battery life, the likes of which must be experienced to be believed. Images, webpages, video and text all look amazing on the Pixel XL’s expansive 5.5in panel. Like the Galaxy S7 and LG G5’s display, it is a joy to behold, a joy to use and a marvel when compared to what you get on Apple’s smaller iPhones. Google Pixel XL Review: Specs & Features This is where the Pixel XL REALLY does come into its own. Not only does it run an exclusive, Google-designed version of Android Nougat but it is also the first smartphone on the planet to run Qualcomm’s latest, greatest and VR-enabling Snapdragon 821 CPU. I expected things to be smooth and potent, but nothing prepared me for just how good the Pixel XL would be – it is unlike any Android phone I have ever used. Menus. Scrolling. Apps. Everything is lightning fast. Now, some of this is down to Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 821 CPU and the copious amount of RAM included inside the Pixel XL. But a lot of it is to do with Google’s increased control over the software and hardware. As Apple has proven for years, if you’re in control of everything you can eke out more performance from a handset, a process that is done by ensuring the hardware – CPU, RAM, etc – works seamlessly with the software, Android Nougat. Google knows Android better than anyone else and when you use the Pixel XL the command Google has over its OS becomes all the more clear.

But, so what? It’ll be usurped next week by someone else. That’s just how it works in the Android space. But what WILL separate the Pixel XL apart from the “other” Android phones is that its performance will ALWAYS be better. Why? Simple: Google built this phone. It clearly knows what it’s doing, as this phone feels about 10X faster than nearly every other Android phone I’ve tested this year – including the Samsung Galaxy S7, Note 7 and HTC 10. And the only reason that I can think of for why this might be the case is the level of attention Google has put into developing this phone as a seamless piece of technology. The traditional way Android phones are built is a bit different: a phone maker designs and builds a phone. They then install Android on it, usually after ruining it with a custom skin. After a bit of tinkering and testing, the phone gets shipped out to consumers. This is the way ALL Android handsets are made. And this is why they are often problematic – see Samsung’s recent Galaxy Note 7 episode. The Pixel phones are different, though, because they feel as if they have been designed AROUND Android. Android is the star of the show here. Not an EDGE display, nor an odd chassis, or a missing headphone jack. No. These phones are ALL about Android. Period. I could go on about how good the Pixel XL is to use in a day-to-day setting, but by now you probably get the picture. This phone is stunning in the performance department and it is unlike anything else that came before it. I think this is why Google changed the name. It did it because Nexus was not good enough for this phone. It deserved something new and fresh and unique for the phone space because that’s what this phone is all about: a new direction for Google and Android. --------------------------------------------------------- Two Month Update: Problems With My Pixel XL Google’s Pixel XL is one of the best Android phones you can buy right now. The Pixel XL isn’t the most exciting handset to look at but the specs, performance and software are great. Ditto imaging. So all is forgiven in the looks department. The Pixel XL is Google’s iPhone, basically. It is Google taking a more nuanced and focussed approach to hardware inside the Android space. We had Nexus phones before, sure, but the Pixel phones are different; and not just in terms of how much they cost. The Pixel phones are the truest embodiment of what Android should look and feel like on a phone. And for the most part, Google smashed the ball outta the park – both Pixel phones are exceptional performers in every regard. But there is a problem with my Pixel XL. It likes to pass out sometimes. You can’t predict when it will happen, but like an heavy-drinker it is usually at night – after 10pm. This crashing issue has been noted by other users, I've read reports about it in the past, but figured my handset must have not been affected. I was wrong. My handset is affected, so whatever this bug is it can, presumably, hit a Pixel phone at any time, as mine was fine and then all of a sudden it wasn’t. What happens is a two fold process: the screen freezes, then the phone restarts. It’s annoying as hell, as 1) it’s unpredictable and 2) it takes about 2 minutes for the phone to then reboot. I’ve tried factory resetting the handset and this hasn't fixed the issue which makes me think it is either a full-on hardware defect or something that Google can fix with a software update. Either way, I’m hoping it gets fixed soon as it is starting to get rather annoying. --------------------------------------------------------- Google Pixel XL Review: Camera UPDATE: Google WILL Fix Halo-Flare Bug With Software Update Google has confirmed there is an issue with the Pixel’s camera and will soon issue a software fix to remedy it. A lot of Pixel users have noticed a weird, halo-like effect that appears on some images. The bug apparently affects all Pixel handsets – whether you’ve experienced it or not – but it is now in the process of being eliminated by a software patch that will appear shortly. “In a post from the Pixel User Community,” notes Phandroid, “a Googler flat out confirms that the Pixel “has a little too much of the ‘halo/arc’ flare” but they’re already working on a fix. No, there’s not going to be a global recall (heh). Instead, Google says a future software update — arriving in the next few weeks — will help alleviate the appearance of the halo/light arc in photos. Using new algorithms to identify the halo, Google believes they’ll be able to eliminate it from photos, almost like a quick PhotoShop job being done on the fly.” As of December 1, although the above issue has been fixed, a new camera-related bug is apparently afflicting many Pixel and Pixel XL users. Specifically, this bug is related to the camera application itself. A post on the Google Pixel user community outlines the problem, apparently the application freezes  with "pink/purple vertical lines very regularly although not all the time." The users have tried clearing the application cache and data, and to perform factory resets on the phone, but this has not fixed the issue - even running the phone in safe mode doesn't help. The number of users experiencing this problem and posting in the thread has increased, and some have discovered the issue appears to be tied to poor signal reception areas; having aeroplane mode switched on also seems to keep the problem at bay, oddly. A post made in the thread by a Google official confirms that the company is investigating the issue. ---------------------------------------------- Forget what Apple says, the best camera on the market RIGHT NOW is inside the Google Pixel XL. I’ve been snapping images with it for just over a week and I have to say, once again, it is unlike anything I have used before. It doesn’t matter where you’re shooting, or in what type of light, the Pixel XL will deliver solid, good-looking, detailed images. I suck at photography, big time, so if the Pixel XL can make my photographs look good then someone more capable should be churning out works of art with this thing. So what makes the camera so good? Three core aspects, in my opinion: 1) a simple application, 2) the speed with which it loads up and snaps pictures and 3) insanely fast focus. Couple this with an excellent 12.3MP sensor, large 1.55μm pixels and an f/2.0 aperture and you have a camera setup that is currently unparalleled in the mobile space. The Galaxy S7 and iPhone 7 Plus have excellent cameras, but neither are as good as the shooter inside the Pixel XL. Alongside the software inside the Pixel XL, this is one of the phone’s biggest USPs. Interestingly, it’s one I wasn’t expecting. I know Google said the Pixel XL has the best camera ever at launch, but I figured that was just locker-room talk – not an actual statement of fact! It’s much the same with video as well. You can shoot in 4K and the results look amazing when played back on a compatible device. And if all this wasn’t good enough, Google is giving ALL Pixel users unlimited storage for all their pictures and videos – even 4K ones – so you’ll never run out of space on your phone ever again. Google Pixel XL Review: Android. Android. Android! I’ve been saying this for years, but it still stands: if you LOVE Android, use a Nexus phone - and this applies just as much to the Pixel phones too. Why? Simple: Pixel phones run the purest form of Android, with zero bloatware, designed and functioning just as Google intended. If you value things like this, as I do, then there really is no competition in this regard. You get Android updates first, while other, more costly Android phones have to wait months. There is no bloatware inside; just Google apps and the one’s you choose to install. You get immediate access to all the latest security patches and fixes and, generally speaking, everything runs a lot smoother as a result. The Pixel Phones also feature a bunch of unique software attributes that you CANNOT get anywhere else. These are as follows: Google Assistant Unlimited Storage For Photos and Video (even 4K video)  The Pixel Launcher Smart Storage  24/7 Support  Pixel Camera I have never understood why people who like Android get anything other than a Nexus phone. They get updates first, were always solid and most of the time were cheaper than handsets from HTC, LG and Samsung. This latter point no longer stands, as the Pixel phones are rather pricy, however, the former points still do – and they’re now even better as a lot of what makes the Pixel tick is exclusive to the Pixel. The Pixel Launcher is Google’s new stock Android look. It’s smart, tidy and packed with useful features. Assistant is always accessible by voice or a long hold on the home button. You can also swipe right to access Assistant. The app tray is gone, sort of… now you simply swipe up from the bottom of the display to access your applications. The wallpapers Google has included are STUNNING. They have this awesome slow-zoom effect when you unlock the phone, which is so subtle you might not notice it. Android has never looked better in my opinion. It has also never been smarter, thanks to Google Assistant which is now leagues ahead of Siri in every regard. Update: Android 7.1 Preview Pushed OTA In Canada - Reveals New Feature We're not sure whether someone pressed the wrong button, but some users in Canada are reporting having recevied an OTA update which pushes a Preview build of Android 7.1 to the Google Pixel phones. The new build, labelled “Security Update + Bug Fixes,” is a 261MB Android 7.1 file with the build number NPF26J. The "P" stands for Preview, and ordinarily such builds would not be published OTA in this manner. Regardless, users are reporting a new feature lands with the update which isn't mentioned in the changelogs; a couple of new gesture options are added to the "Move" menu which allow the user to activate some Always-On display-like features to check notifications by either tapping the display or lifting the phone up. 9To5Google reports that users claim the features work well, with no bugs or issues encountered so far. On December 5 Google has now made Android 7.1.1 available to Google Pixel handsets, both as an over-the-air (OTA) download and as downloadable factory image files which you can load onto the device manually. The files are available for; Pixel, Pixel XL, Nexus 6P (all carriers but Verizon), Nexus 5X, Nexus 9, Nexus 9 LTE, and the Nexus Player. The update brings some of the Pixel features to non-Pixel phones, though not all; some stuff is being kept as Pixel exclusive content. As well as this, the download includes the latest Android security patches. As of December 12, Google has released a small, additional update patch for the Pixel and Pixel XL units designated NMF26Q, specifically for UK O2 network handsets. The update doesn't change the build number, but simply adds in some fixes that were left out of the main 7.1.1 update for reasons unknown at this time. The changelog simply reads: "remove spaces in front of APN types so that telephony can find APNs that can handle a particular type properly". It's believed the fix relates to MMS media messages. It's also expected that this update may see a wider release soon, as similar connection issues have been noted outside of the UK as well. Google Pixel XL Review: Battery Battery performance isn’t the most glitzy subject to talk about, but it is something 100% of mobile users value. No one phone has yet taken battery performance to a level comparable to what we had back in the days of the Nokia 3310. The Pixel XL doesn’t remedy this situation either, but what it does it still very impressive by today’s standards. Whatever you do with this phone it just flat out REFUSES to consume juice. During testing I pushed this phone as hard as I could. I went away on a trip for 24 hours, didn’t take a charger and used the phone normally, assuming it would die in the wee hours of the morning, but, lo and behold, the Pixel XL was still alive and kicking with 20% left in the tank when I returned home the following day. I sometimes forget to charge it and it will EASILY last until about 2pm. Nothing hurts this phone. I have no idea how Google has done this but it is DAMN impressive. The only phone that is remotely comparable is the Huawei Mate 8… but even that phone pales in comparison to what the Pixel XL is capable of with respect to battery conservation. If you don’t use the Pixel XL, it simply doesn’t use battery life, a first for Android phones in my experience. Push it hard – like, REALLY hard – and it will last a full day and a half. This is the only phone I have ever used that I can feel confident about taking it out after work, without a top-up, and not worry about it dying on me when I need it most, usually around 2am, after a skin-full and in dire need of an Uber. The Pixel XL’s battery performance is utterly bonkers. There’s just no other word to describe it. Google Pixel XL Review: Verdict There are so many Android handsets to choose from with very little, in terms of specs and hardware, to actually separate them. A lot of people are loyal to brands – Apple and Samsung – while others prefer to go for value; value like the OnePlus 3 or BlackBerry DTEK50, for instance. The Pixel phones kind of sit outside of both these categories, as the brand and name itself, at least in the mobile space, is completely untested. This is why Google is spending so much coin on promoting the Pixel phones, both here and in the US. It wants you to buy into the brand of Pixel; it wants you to view these handsets as its iPhone. And this is a tough sell. Apple didn’t become Apple overnight and Samsung has spent BILLIONS promoting its brand to consumers, meaning Google has quite a bit of catching-up to do. But once you use this phone, it kind of sells itself. There is a lot of hatred for this brand of phone; people say it’s too expensive, that it’s dull looking. But for some Android purists – people like me – that doesn’t matter. I’ve been waiting for Google to do a phone like this since the Nexus One, a phone that gets updates first, a phone that has best-in-class specs, and a phone, importantly, with excellent battery life. Obviously I’d prefer it if this handset was cheaper. I think Google could have taken a hit on the chin and lowered its margin for the phone, but it hasn’t and that’s just something you’ll have to deal with. No one’s forcing you to buy this phone, after all. Apple has never compromised on price. Ever. Even when it’s iPhones were out-specced and out-designed, the company still retailed them as high as it possibly could. This is what Google’s doing and while you might not like it, the company clearly has an eye on what it wants to achieve with this handset; it wants to create an Android version of the iPhone. It wants to make the perfect Android phone and while this handset isn’t perfect – the design, the price, etc – it’s better than nearly every other Android phone I have tested in the past 18 months with respect to performance, imaging and battery life. If you love Android, buy this phone. If you want market-leading battery performance and a brilliant camera, buy this phone. Nothing else compares. I used to be a Nexus purist. Not anymore. Now I am a Pixel purist. Nexus is dead… Long live the KING! Google Pixel XL Review: Where To Buy One?  Unless you’ve been living under a rock for the past week, you will have seen Google’s rather EPIC Pixel advertising campaign in full swing. The adverts are, quite literally, everywhere your eyeballs dare to wonder. The ads are well produced and they look good but they are a bit confusing, as a lot of them emphasise the “Exclusive on Verizon” angle, which is only half true – you can also get the phones direct from Google. Still, if you’re a longstanding Verizon user then you might want to check out some of the deals the network is offering on the Pixel and Pixel XL. I just had a quick gander and some of them look pretty tasty.  If you're in the UK and are looking for a BADASS contract for either of Google's excellent Pixel phones, then you NEED to check out Carphone Warehouse's current batch – they're some of the best we've seen to date.  And if you want more details on buying options for the Pixel and Pixel XL be sure to check out our Pixel and Pixel XL Buying Guide  Read More About: Mobile Phones Google Google Pixel XL Android Nougat Sponsored Links Related content Google Pixel 2 WILL Feature Waterproofing As Standard 4 Huawei Mate 9 Review: BIG, Bold & Very Clever The BlackBerry PRIV 2 COMETH – Leaked Pics Land Online 5 Google Pixel XL Review: The Best Android Phone Right Now Samsung Galaxy S8 Release Date & Specs Rumours View the discussion thread.

Register for an Exam Today> Google's Pixel Phone Shines Despite Misgauging Demand By Michael Liedtke PUBLISHED: JANUARY 27 2017 The Pixel phone, Google's answer to Apple's iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy, is off to a promising start -- but might have done even better had Google managed consumer demand as smartly as the device's sleek design. Although Google hasn't released sales figures, industry researchers say the Pixel [pictured above] has been a hot item since its October debut was greeted with mostly glowing reviews and the biggest marketing blitz in Google's 18-year history. But there were missed opportunities. Google didn't have enough Pixels available to meet demand. Rather than wait several weeks, many consumers interested in the Pixel probably bought an iPhone, Galaxy or another phone instead. And these people aren't likely to need a phone replacement for another year or two. Google also struck a deal to sell it through just one wireless carrier, Verizon. Although Google's online store sold Pixels compatible with other wireless networks, most people don't shop for phones that way. Of course, it's a moot point if there weren't enough Pixels to sell, but Google likely would have produced more if it had distribution deals with other carriers. It's not surprising that Google misjudged the market, given that this is the search company's first stab at making its own phone. Previously, it partnered with various manufacturers on a Nexus line of phones to showcase its Android operating system, but that effort barely made a dent. "This was probably a really good learning experience for them," says Neil Doshi, an analyst with Mizhuo Securities USA. The Pixel's success is important to Google because it wants to ensure there's a stylish Android phone to compete with the iPhone and drive more affluent consumers to its search engine, maps, YouTube videos and other services. Samsung's Galaxy and other phones also run on Android, but those devices have been de-emphasizing Google's services. Google, which is based in Mountain View, California, can afford to make some mistakes as it tries to establish the Pixel because its internet search and advertising network brings in so much revenue. Alphabet, Google's corporate parent, provided another reminder of its financial might with Thursday's release of its fourth-quarter earnings. The company earned $5.3 billion on revenue of $26 billion during the final three months of last year. Even after subtracting commissions paid to Google's ad partners, Alphabet's revenue totaled $21 billion -- a 23 percent increase from a year earlier. The company's profit rose 8 percent from the prior year. Although Pixel sales weren't disclosed, the numbers provided a clue on how the phone did. Google's "other revenue" segment, which covers all sales outside of advertising, generated $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter, a 62 percent increase from the same time last year. Some of those gains came from sales of Google's new internet-connected speaker, Home, and its business software services, but Doshi believes most of the increase was generated by the Pixel. He estimates Google sold 1 million to 1.5 million Pixels during the fourth quarter. That's still just a sliver of the estimated 77 million that Apple sold during the same period (Apple is scheduled to release its numbers Tuesday). Pixel sales are also well below the roughly 15 million Galaxy S7 that Samsung sold during that device's first quarter on the market. Still, analysts say the Pixel did exceptionally well for a new phone with little brand recognition. "Without question, Google has a hit on its hands and is building a platform for success," says Jeff Moore, principal of Wave7 Research. Wave7 estimates that Pixel accounted for 12 percent of activations in December compared with 51 percent for iPhones and 26 percent for Samsung devices. Localytics, which tracks app activity on nearly 2 billion smartphones, also reported Pixel activations have steadily increased since sales began, especially around the Thanksgiving weekend and the holidays. "It looks like it has the potential to be a strong competitor to the likes of Apple and Samsung," says Josh Todd, Localytics' chief marketing officer. © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

Samsung Galaxy S8 Specs Revealed Next Article > Qualcomm Hit with More Apple Lawsuits By Shirley Siluk / Sci-Tech Today PUBLISHED: JANUARY 26 2017 Chipmaking giant Qualcomm is facing yet more accusations that its business practices are unfair and anticompetitive, with Apple filing lawsuits in the U.S. and China. On Friday, Apple filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court for the Southern District of California alleging that Qualcomm's practices have cost Apple nearly $1 billion in damages. That complaint came on the heels of two other lawsuits -- one seeking more than $145 million in damages -- against Qualcomm that Apple filed last week in China. Qualcomm is also facing allegations of unfair and anticompetitive practices by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. The FTC filed a complaint against the chipmaker in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on Jan. 17. 'Dominance through Excessive Royalties' The complaints center on Qualcomm's pricing and patent royalty arrangements for its broadband processors that enable mobile phones to connect with cellular networks. Qualcomm's modem chip design was used to help establish standards for the telecom industry. In return for that standardization, Qualcomm committed to licensing those technologies to other companies on FRAND (fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory) terms. However, Apple's complaints contend that Qualcomm is charging it royalties for "technologies they have nothing to do with." That statement, contained in an email Apple sent to a number of press outlets last week, continued, "The more Apple innovates with unique features such as TouchID, advanced displays, and cameras, to name just a few, the more money Qualcomm collects for no reason and the more expensive it becomes for Apple to fund these innovations." Apple said in the email, "Qualcomm built its business on older, legacy, standards but reinforces its dominance through exclusionary tactics and excessive royalties. Despite being just one of over a dozen companies who contributed to basic cellular standards, Qualcomm insists on charging Apple at least five times more in payments than all the other cellular patent licensors we have agreements with combined." Most recently, Qualcomm has gone even further, withholding "nearly $1B in payments from Apple as retaliation for responding truthfully to law enforcement agencies investigating them," Apple added. Apple's two complaints in China make similar allegations, according to a report yesterday by Reuters. Those lawsuits accuse Qualcomm of abusing its dominant position in the global chip industry and failing to license its technologies fairly as it had agreed to do. 'A Commercial Dispute over Price of IP' In a statement issued yesterday, Qualcomm said it had not yet seen the two lawsuits filed in China. The statement included comments from Qualcomm executive vice president and general counsel Don Rosenberg. "These filings by Apple's Chinese subsidiary are just part of Apple's efforts to find ways to pay less for Qualcomm's technology. Apple was offered terms consistent with terms accepted by more than one hundred other Chinese companies and refused to even consider them," Rosenberg said. "These terms were consistent with our NDRC Rectification plan. Qualcomm is prepared to defend its business model anywhere in the world." During yesterday's Q1 2017 earnings call, in which Qualcomm reported year-over-year revenue growth of 4 percent and Q1 revenues of $6 billion, CEO Steven Mollenkopf noted, "Apple's complaint contains a lot of assertions. But in the end, this is a commercial dispute over the price of intellectual property. They want to pay less than the fair value that Qualcomm has established in the marketplace for our technology, even though Apple has generated billions in profits from using that technology." In December, the Korea Fair Trade Commission imposed a fine of 1.03 trillion won ($880 million) on Qualcomm for what it called an "unfair business model" for licensing technology at the handset rather than chip level. In 2015, the European Commission also launched two antitrust investigations into "possible abusive [behavior]" by Qualcomm in connection with its pricing and licensing practices for modem chipsets.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Alphabet’s sexiest projects still aren’t making it money Chris Davies - Jan 27, 2017 1 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Google is still the jewel in Alphabet’s financial results crown, helping drive revenues up 22-percent year-on-year in Q4 2016, but its “moonshot” projects remain a money pit. The company announced its Q4 and fiscal year 2016 results this week, raking in $26.1bn in quarterly revenues and $5.3bn in GAAP net income. However, its more ambitious Alphabet projects still lag considerably behind the company’s more traditional businesses. Though the market rewarded Alphabet’s numbers with a dip in share price, executives were upbeat about the quarter. “This performance was led by mobile search and YouTube,” Ruth Porat, Alphabet’s Chief Financial Officer, said. “We’re seeing great momentum in Google’s newer investment areas and ongoing strong progress in Other Bets.” Despite that enthusiasm, however, “Other Bets” – the catch-all category for some of the more offbeat projects underway at Alphabet – has been a mixed bag. At first glance, it looks like a growing success. Indeed, year-on-year growth of 74.7-percent with quarterly revenues growing from $150m in Q4 2015 to $262m in Q4 2016 aren’t to be sniffed at, even if they’re a fraction of the $7.9bn Google businesses like search, YouTube, ads, and such delivered in the same three month period. Look closer, and it’s clear that only a subset of “Other Bets” are actually delivering, though. Indeed, there are three such successes: Nest’s portfolio of connected thermostats, cameras, and smart smoke alarms; the Fiber high-speed internet service; and finally Verily, the tech-shaped life-sciences firm which just this week landed $800m investment from a Singapore investment group. That leaves plenty of other stablemates who really aren’t performing. Indeed the remainder of the “Other Bets” group contributed an operating loss of $1.088 billion. That was an improvement year-on-year – in Q4 2015 it was more than $1.2bn – but projects like self-driving cars, balloons that deliver internet service to remote locations, and GV (formerly Google Ventures) weren’t the cash generators investors might have hoped. 2016 saw several projects within the group shuttered, including the ambitious Project Ara modular smartphone. Even with its successes, it’s unclear how “Other Bets” will fare in 2017. Google Fiber, for instance, paused its operations back in September 2016 as it looked to “refine its approach”; job losses from the division were also tipped. The Titan solar-powered drone project was “permanently grounded” earlier this month. Alphabet – and Google before it, prior to the holding company’s creation midway through 2015 – has always been upfront about the fact that its moonshots like Google X are experimental and not necessarily revenue-contributing at first. All the same, as it attempts to spin projects out into standalone businesses, as the self-driving car team became Waymo, it seems likely that patience will run thin for work which still seems far from delivering anything like the cashflow that more mundane divisions like AdSense do.

Google responds to this illicit behaviour by banning ads. In 2016, the company took down nearly 1.7 billion ads that violated their policies, which is twice as many ads it took down the year before. There are many ways in which scammers try and deceive the unsuspecting Internet user. One of the popular ways is by loading malware by showing fake system warnings (dubbed “trick to click”), leading the user to believe their computing devices are affected and that clicking it will fix the problem (when there was no problem to begin with). Google developed systems that would spot these malicious ads, and in 2016 detected and disabled 112 million of them, a 6x increase from the past year. Next, the search giant also cracked down on ads that promote illegal activities or products. For instance, 17 million gambling ads that did not have the proper authorisation were taken down, and 68 million healthcare related ads that were not legitimate were pulled down too. There are also scams that go by the name of ‘tabloid cloakers’. You’ll typically see what looks like a clickbaity news story, but instead of landing on a news portal, you’ll end up landing on a site that sells products, say for weight-loss. Google took down 1,300 accounts responsible for publishing these ads. The company also went the whole nine yards on sites that were promoting 'payday loans', suspending 8000 websites from the Internet, over and above banning 5 million payday loan ads on their platform. Last but not the least, the company also tightened its stance on the rise of fake news on the Internet, by introducing a new AdSense misrepresentative content policy. After reviewing over 500 websites that were suspected of misinforming its audience, with some of them even impersonating as news organisations, action was taken against 340 of them and 200 publishers were permanently kicked out of Google's ad network. You can read more about these actions on its blog. Google makes a majority of their revenue using ads, so it’s in their best interest to keep malicious ones from creeping into their system, and lose customer faith. Beyond this, they’re also working with publishers to make ads that aren’t as obtrusive.

In contrast, the web version has been languishing for years with Google’s pre-Material Design style. Today, a significant revamp brings it to visual and feature parity. Dropping the white top bar, Contacts adopts Material Design with a blue app bar that features a hamburger button and navigation drawer. A FAB in the bottom right corner allows users to add contacts in a simplified overlay that shows fewer fields by default. The main list is now organized in similar fashion to mobile and first shows your starred contacts. This feature parity also extends to the contact card where a new ‘Interactions’ section shows past emails and calendar events. In comparison, ‘Recent’ in Android shows calls and text messages, but hopefully a future update would add the full Interactions. Added to the navigation drawer is a new ‘Frequent contacts’ section and Duplicates, instead of ‘Suggestions’ on mobile. Underneath is a ‘Labels’ dropdown that can be minimized and ‘More’ which includes: Import, Export, Print, Undo changes, and Other contacts. Settings is sparse with only language controls, phone number country code, and first/last name sort. Interestingly, this Material version of contacts is still labeled as a ‘Preview’ and allows users to revert back to the old interface from the navigation drawer. Heading to contacts.google.com should load the new version, with the initial launch walking users through a tutorial.

Image: laser.beam/instagram By Victoria HoSingapore2017-01-24 06:24:09 UTC Pokémon Go has finally come to South Korea, more than six months after the global phenomenon launched in other regions. While the South Korean smartphone market is among the more advanced globally, it took months for the mobile game to be released there because of government restrictions on Google Maps, which the game relies on. SEE ALSO: 'Pokémon Go' banned in China over public safety concerns South Korea's national security laws prevent companies like Google from exporting government-provided map data, which is necessary to power Pokémon Go's functions. According to Korean media, the game's maker Niantic Labs had to figure out a workaround for its map in South Korea, so as not violate the law. Niantic didn't specify what that workaround was. Because the country's release has been so belated, Pokémon trainers in the country ended up flocking to the tiny beach town of Sokcho in the country's northeast, which had somehow not been affected by the mapping restrictions. Travel and hotel booking sites like Hotels.com noted last year that searches for Sokcho surged upon word getting round that the game worked there. On Tuesday, eager players started catching Pokémon and posting their hunts on social media. A photo posted by 하늘자리 진이 (@jini_i1) on Jan 23, 2017 at 4:29pm PST This player says: "The last Pokémon (caught) in Sokcho has been well, and now I have to incubate (new) eggs." A photo posted by 수 정❣ (@__soobong_) on Jan 23, 2017 at 8:12pm PST A photo posted by 김상봉😁 (@musicianspace) on Jan 23, 2017 at 8:11pm PST While the fever appears to have just begun in South Korea, it remains to be seen how long the excitement will last. Just a couple of months after Pokémon Go was released in neighbouring Japan — the birthplace of Pokémon — a survey found that just a fraction of players were still into the game. One of the biggest reasons for the drop-off was that people found the game repetitive, respondents said.

Image: DUSTIN DRANKOSKI/MASHABLE By Manish SinghIndia2017-01-24 07:26:28 UTC Despite Google’s aggressive push to lure the Indian market into purchasing its Google Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones, the company has failed to impress the price conscious country. SEE ALSO: Buzzkill Google: Don't play your music so loud if you don't like audio issues Google’s first branded smartphones went on sale in India late August, the same month they were globally unveiled. This was a stark deviation from the general norm that sees companies take weeks — and sometimes months — in bringing their top smartphones to India.  But it appears Google’s inclination to India didn’t return same response. The company has so far sold little less than 50,000 units of Google Pixel and Pixel XL in India, according to Tarun Pathak, senior analyst at marketing research firm Counterpoint.  Other analysts and insiders have arrived at similar figures. According to the Economic Times, which cites those insiders, Google shipped about 40,000 Pixel phone units in India.  Analysts blame Google's pricing strategy for the slow uptake in India for its Pixel smartphones.  Analysts blame Google's pricing strategy for the slow uptake for its Pixel smartphones. The starting price of the Pixel smartphone is Rs 57,000 ($855), whereas the base Pixel XL model was selling at Rs 67,000 ($1,005). People who wanted to purchase the top-of-the-line 128GB variant of the Pixel had to pay Rs 66,000 ($990), whereas 128GB of the Pixel XL was setting people back by Rs 76,000 ($1,140).  Any phone that costs this much is going to find it tough to fare well with the Indian market, which mostly invests in phones that are priced under $150.  "Premium market is very niche going at a rate of close to million units per quarter," Pathak adds. This is a fraction of the total number of smartphones that ship every quarter. For instance, more than 27 million smartphones shipped in India in Q2 2016, according to IDC.  To make things tougher for Google, many people who do decide to spend that sort of money on a smartphone end up picking up an iPhone. According to Counterpoint, a quarter of the premium smartphones sold in India are iPhones.  The other popular premium smartphones come from Samsung, which currently sells the Galaxy S7 for Rs 43,400 ($637) and the Galaxy S7 edge for Rs 50,900 ($747), both significantly cheaper than Google's Pixel smartphones. In order to ramp up sales, online retailers like Flipkart and Amazon India are offering flat discounts of up to Rs 10,000 ($147) on Pixel smartphones in some cases.

While the handset raked in stunning reviews with its silky smooth performance, spectacular camera and nifty virtual assistant, not everyone loved its hefty price – but this might all change soon. Citing an undisclosed but reliable source, 9to5Google reports the Big G has set its sights on bringing a bundle of enhancements to its second-generation Pixel as well as a modest ‘budget’ model of the flagship device, aimed at “emerging markets.” While the budget alternative will come at a “significantly cheaper” price, the higher-end model is expected to see “at least” a $50 hike in price – it will however offer a slew of improvements. Among other things, Google is said to have devoted its efforts to further refining the already excellent camera. The report also suggests the search engine giant is testing with enhanced chipsets from two different manufacturers – including Qualcomm and Intel. Though the next-gen Pixel will likely sport a camera that might “not have large MP size,” the device will “compensate in extra features.” In line with earlier speculation, Google’s new flagship handset is also slated to be waterproof – a feature many technophiles felt should’ve been included in the original Pixel. While prior reports suggested the next-gen version will “definitely” have water resistance, more recent rumors indicate the functionality is “still on the table,” but not yet confirmed. The budget model, codenamed ‘Pixel 2B,’ will come with slightly less powerful hardware specs and will likely start shipping shortly after the release of its higher-end counterpart.

Yet Amazon.com Inc's (AMZN.O) surprise success sets up a long-term battle with Apple Inc. (AAPL.O) and Alphabet Inc's Google (GOOGL.O) for primacy in the connected household. And the contours of that competition are following a classic tech industry dynamic. Amazon is pursuing an open-systems approach that allows quick development of many features, while Apple is taking a slower route, asserting more control over the technology in order to assure security and ease-of-use. The strategic importance of the "connected home" niche looms large: Amazon wants a way to own its customer interactions -mainly shopping online - without an Apple phone or a Google Web browser as an intermediary. Apple needs to keep the iPhone at the center of customers’ lives, and has built a whole home automation architecture, called Homekit, into its smartphone. Google, for its part, is investing heavily in both intelligent assistant software and home-automation devices like the Nest thermostats and, more recently, the Google Home speaker. But Google is behind in the race, with its speaker only hitting the market in November and compatible with a handful of gadgets beyond Nest and Dropcam, which the company also owns. “When the iPhone rolled out in 2007, everyone developed [software] for that. Right now, everyone is developing for the voice-activated Internet,” said Mark Mahaney, an analyst and managing director with RBC Capital Markets. Mahaney estimates Amazon sold as many as 10 million Alexa-enabled devices over the holiday season. Google hasn't disclosed sales for its Home speaker. Apple has declined to comment on reports that it has a voice-activated speaker in the works. Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said the company is leading the industry by being the first to integrate home automation into a major platform with iOS 10. “The number of HomeKit-compatible accessories continues to grow rapidly with many exciting solutions announced just this month,” she said. For the smart home, the key developer partners are the makers of household devices ranging from lighting systems to refrigerators. There are currently about 250 devices that are certified to work with Alexa, and Amazon has encouraged rapid development of third-party applications with its open-systems approach and even financial incentives for some partners. Apple's Homekit, by contrast, has about 100 certified devices. And the reasons behind that gap show both the risks and the potential rewards of Apple's approach. HOW APPLE EXERTS CONTROL To be Homekit-certified, gadget makers must include special chips to work with Apple’s system. Developers that order small volumes of the chips say they can cost an 50 cents to $2, though prices are lower for larger buyers. Apple also requires developers to buy specific WiFi and Bluetooth networking chips that cost more than competitors. The devices have to be made in special factories that are certified by Apple. A confidential Apple document obtained by Reuters lists more than 800 of these factories, but only a few specialize in home automation products. Developers can ask Apple to certify an unlisted factory they want to use. But the limited selection means that device makers can't always get the best prices or work with their preferred factories. The founder of one startup that considered pursuing HomeKit approval for a device that helps control home temperatures said the company picked a factory with 40,000 employees that was making well known "Star Wars" toys, but it couldn't use that factory for HomeKit products. "They're a huge company, a legitimate manufacturer that makes tech household brands. And yet they're not [Apple] certified," said the founder, who declined to speak on the record because of non-disclosure agreements with Apple. Manufacturers also have to send product samples to Cupertino, where Apple tests them extensively for compatibility. The whole process can take three to five months. During that time, device makers aren't allowed to say publicly that they're pursuing HomeKit certification. Some developers say it's worth it. "They found issues with our product before we released it that we didn't find in our testing," said Gimmy Chu, CEO of Nanoleaf, a smart lighting system. "We know that after we have the certification that it's rock solid." AMAZON'S "OPEN" APPROACH Alexa, by contrast, only requires smart home companies to write software code and submit it to Amazon for review. There are no special chips. To earn the "Works with Alexa" label -which isn’t required to function with Alexa but does help promote products on Amazon’s website - startups must have their products physically tested. Amazon does allow that to happen in a third-party lab, however. Once those certifications are in hand, Amazon says it will decide whether or not a device gets the “Works with Alexa” label within 10 days. Apple's approach has some clear advantages when it comes to privacy, security and ease-of-use. HomeKit gadgets, for example, can operate without being connected to the Internet. (An iPad or Apple TV connected to the Internet is required if you want to control devices when you’re outside the house.) “It also makes for a better user experience,” notes Ahmed Abdallah, a senior engineer at Incipio, which makes HomeKit-compatible devices such as electrical outlets. “You’ll experience some latency if you’re always having to bounce off the cloud” as with Alexa. Apple also has an advantage around setup. iPhone owners open up the Home app and set up a device with just a few taps. With Alexa, customers have to download the gadget’s companion app first, set up the device, then add a “skill” to Alexa in the Alexa app. Apple's ease of setup lured in some big brands like Hunter Fan Company, the top-selling ceiling fan maker in the U.S. “If that experience isn’t good, it has a strong negative halo on the brand because customers just assume the product is bad,” said John Neilson, the company’s chief marketing officer. Amazon acknowledges that unlike Apple, it can't guarantee the security of third-party devices. A company spokeswoman did note that sensitive commands like unlocking doors have an extra layer of security such as a voice-controlled PIN. Still, it's not clear whether Apple's elaborate but slow-to-develop system will have enough advantages to overcome Amazon's widening lead. “The danger I see for Apple and the home is they’re assuming that because I have a smartphone that may be an Apple device, that alone is enough of a Trojan horse to establish their mindshare,” said Andreas Stavropoulos, a partner at venture capital firm DFJ. “I wouldn’t say that's certain yet.” (Editing by Jonathan Weber and Edward Tobin) The Amazon Echo, a voice-controlled virtual assistant, is seen at its product launch for Britain and Germany in London, Britain, September 14, 2016.

Google Pixel and Pixel XL: Display and camera quality 4. Google Pixel and Pixel XL: Software and Verdict The Google Pixel represents an important moment in the smartphone industry. Why? Because the new Google Pixel phone and its supersized cousin, the Google Pixel XL, represent a paradigm shift. The Pixel phone is Google, finally, going out on a limb and stamping its own mark on a smartphone, and it’s going directly after the big boys. The clue is in the pricing, which let’s face it, is going to be a huge disappointment to fans (and I count myself among them) of the now-defunct Nexus brand. The Nexus name always stood for reasonable prices, great specifications and a chance to keep up with the freshest, most up-to-date version of Android. The Pixel brand retains only two of those key strengths, ditching low prices in favour of iPhone-matching, wallet-shrinking starting prices of £599 for the Pixel and £719 for the Pixel XL.

So do the new Google phones deliver, and are they a match for the iPhone 7 or the Samsung Galaxy S7? Are they as good as the prices suggest they should be or has Google slipped up? The answer is, as it so frequently is to such rhetorical questions, a bit of both.

From a design perspective, I prefer them to Apple iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. I was sent the larger of the two to review and was immediately struck by how much impact a little cut in weight and height makes. The Google Pixel XL simply feels more comfortable to hold and slip into the pocket than the iPhone 7 Plus, the standard Pixel even more so, and I’m a fan of the way it looks too. Image 2 of 26 Essentially, it's a progression of the design seen on last year's Nexus 6P, just a little more polished. It could even be described as a touch outlandish, with its inset glass camera surround spanning the top third of the rear panel, encompassing the camera and circular, centre-mounted fingerprint reader. I like it; you may not, but at least you couldn’t call the design bland. What I’m not so keen on, and more than a little disappointed by, is the relative ease with which that glass rear seemed to scratch and scuff. Not three days after first easing the Pixel XL from its box, and being very careful about how and where I put it down in the interim, I found several short, light scratches marring the surface. I dread to think what it will look like in a year or so’s time after I’ve grown tired of being ultra-careful with it. Image 7 of 26 Something else I don’t like is the phone’s lack of dust and water resistance. Although it has become apparent since the launch of the two phones that there is a modicum of protection, the two phones are only rated at IP53. That second number is the one that refers to water resistance, and a figure of three, according to Wikipedia, denotes protection from “water falling as a spray at any angle up to 60° from the vertical shall have no harmful effect, utilizing either: a) an oscillating fixture, or b) A spray nozzle with a counterbalanced shield”. So, it’ll probably be okay if you’re caught in a rain shower, but it may not survive you dropping it in the bath. The iPhones and Samsung phones are IP67 and IP68 rated, affording protection against complete immersion at a depth of at least a metre, and for up to 30 minutes, so they’re far more robust when it comes to the wet stuff. So, there’s some good news and some bad news. Everything else about the Pixel is firmly middle of the road, right down to the good old-fashioned 3.5mm headphone jack on the top edge and the white/silver and black/charcoal colours it’s available in. It’s good to see at least one manufacturer rejecting the idea of offering a lurid rose-gold finish. Page 1 of 4 Google Pixel review (and XL): Could Google’s new phone be better than the iPhone 7? 1.

Shame about the no SD card too. £329.for 64Gb. Submitted by JohnW on Tue, 2016-10-18 19:50. The only reasons I can think of are that you want a smaller phone, you want a different OS or that there are cheaper options available. Submitted by WilliW on Tue, 2016-10-18 20:28. Better screen, more inbuilt memory (much better than having an SD Card) proper customer services backup, the latest Google updates. Generally you get what you pay for. The Oneplus is notorious for having zero customer services backup should your phone go wrong. Bugs that go on and on for ages. Craptastic screen. I would never consider getting one. I would consider getting a Pixel when its price drops to match the Galaxy S7. Submitted by Henry_3_Dogg on Tue, 2016-10-18 21:28. £715 and Google still expects to sell your soul to the advertising industry. Absurd. Submitted by BashirKashmiri on Tue, 2016-10-18 21:39. So it has above average battery as well as amazing screen, camera and power and yet its still expensive? There's a lot of iffy Pixel reviews doing the rounds, the facts dont lie though. It's as if reviewers are praising the Pixel through gritted teeth. You have reviewed this as if it's a new Nexus and bemoaning the fact Google have raised their price. Only 2 Nexus phones were below market price btw, Nexus 4 and 5 the rest have been in line with the rest of the market pricing structure of the time. Submitted by JohnW on Tue, 2016-10-18 22:51. It seems to be an inferior phone to the S7 for a higher price. That is the issue reviewers have with it. Submitted by BashirKashmiri on Tue, 2016-10-18 22:56. The camera is a toss up between S7, iPhone 7 and Pixel if you read Engadget, Verge and other reviews. Some preferring the iphone and others the Pixel. The screen on the Pixel is on par or better than the other 2 mentioned and some reviews are mixed on the battery life. Some stating they're getting 2 solid days with the XL and others stating they end 1 day on about 10%. All reviews seem to agree the build quality is top tier. The one thing that is undeniable is the lack of waterproofing. The point is it can hold its own against those 2 top end phones therefore is priced accordingly. You can argue about the lack of one microSD on the pixel or the headphone jack on the Apple but these features are only make or break for a small minority of customers. Submitted by EddyOS on Wed, 2016-10-19 16:59. Seeing as my other comment was deleted, I'll add it again Neither the Pixel, or Pixel XL, have OIS. They both have a (very) good implementation of EIS Submitted by wittgenfrog on Wed, 2016-10-19 17:57. So Google has finally become another Apple with a ludicrously expensive device sporting unique proprietary extensions to its 'Open Source' O/S. The phone is stylistically a straight iPhone rip-off. I'm waiting for the law suits. Given that we all know the extent of Apple's iPhone price-gouging the cost of Google's 'parts bin' special, courtesy of htc, seems even harder to justify. However it makes the gadget 'reassuringly expensive'. It hurts to say this, but this makes the iPhone look almost attractive... Submitted by Goran on Wed, 2016-10-19 20:12. Pixels are, with M9, the worst flagships htc ever made. I thought that it wasn't possible but life is full of surprises. Only one thing is different, this time htc is fully innocent. Submitted by JohnW on Wed, 2016-10-19 22:25. It may be able to hold its own on performance against the ageing S7 but it costs more. The missing SD and wireless charging would be deal breakers for me. As it is I got a Lumia 950 for a quarter of the price as I like the Windows Phone OS. Submitted by BashirKashmiri on Wed, 2016-10-19 22:28. Thats irrelevant, people compare the S7 against the iphone 7 which has neither of those 2 things you mentioned yet no one says it over priced against the S7. Seems to be an argument just for Google, people are suffering from death of Nexus hangovers, they need to get over it. Submitted by JohnW on Thu, 2016-10-20 09:18. The iPhone 7 got plenty of stick for its price in Europe. Google's problem is getting customers to change brands. For that it needs to offer an incentive to change rather than a boring "me too" design that makes people compare it with the likes of Xiaomi and LeEco. Submitted by BashirKashmiri on Thu, 2016-10-20 17:32. LOL, no one is comparing it to Xiaomi or LeEco. BTW they both make good hardware but where do they fail . . . . . normally the software and this is where Google excel! Submitted by LG on Sun, 2016-10-23 11:49. Id love the XL but never at these prices. People pay them to Apple because of the branding, Google isnt anywhere near that level. Ill stick with my Nexus 6p for a while it seems Submitted by Annie on Sun, 2016-11-13 18:54.

The handset will also feature an improved camera and waterproofing, improving on a key weakness of the original. Google's Pixel is intended to rival the iPhone. Tightly coupled with Android, it's Google's first attempt to design its own smartphone hardware. The result has been generally very well received, although there's still room for improvement. This year's Pixel 2 is meant to fill in the gaps to create an even better device. Google is concentrating on improving camera and CPU performance, 9to5Google reported today. The company is said to be developing multiple test versions of the Pixel 2 using different processors. Some have Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 inside, a typical choice for 2017's flagship phones. Others contain Intel silicon though, potentially making the Pixel 2 one of few Android phones with Intel Inside. Google could further distinguish the Pixel by choosing to use Intel's chips. Qualcomm's dominance in the smartphone sector has led to most high-end phones using the same processor each year. Intel's alternatives now offer similar performance, although the Snapdragon is generally more powerful overall. As well as Qualcomm and Intel options, Google is reportedly working on a version of the Pixel that uses a custom chipset it has designed. The role of this chipset is currently uncertain and it may not be used in the final product. In yet another alternative, Google was also collaborating with MediaTek on the Pixel 2. This agreement is now said to have ended. READ MORE: ENGINEERS HOPE TO BREW BEER ON THE MOON As well as a new processor, the Pixel 2 will launch with an upgraded camera for better photographs in low light conditions. Rather than increase the megapixels, Google is working to optimise other aspects of the imaging hardware. It will "compensate in extra features" for the lack of a high-megapixel sensor. These changes won't come cheap though. Google is expected to raise the price of the Pixel 2 over the original phone, adding "at least" $50 to all models. The Pixel has already faced criticism for its pricing so the increase isn’t likely to be received well. Google is said to be developing a solution for this too, a lower-cost Pixel that will cater for people reluctant to splash out on the main device. The Pixel "2B" will be a budget-level phone "significantly cheaper" than the Pixel 2. Google is reportedly testing prototypes of the device with various chipsets, optimising its hardware choices both for performance and for price. As ever, details may change before the public release. The launch of any new Pixel phone is likely to be months away and Google is still developing the new models. Last year, the company chose October for its Pixel unveil. Tech companies tend to release products on a regular schedule so the Pixel 2 should release around the same time this year.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Sat, Jan 28, 2017 - Page 5　 Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Tesla sues ex-Autopilot boss, says secrets stolen AUTONOMY:Tesla seeks to bar Sterling Anderson, ex-Google self-driving car developer Chris Urmson and their start-up from recruiting its employees and contractors Bloomberg Tesla Motors Inc sued the former director of its Autopilot program, accusing him of taking confidential information about the company’s driver-assist system and trying to recruit at least a dozen former colleagues to a new start-up. Sterling Anderson started working last summer on the new autonomous-car venture, Aurora Innovation LLC, before his departure from the company last month, Tesla said on Thursday. Anderson has been collaborating with Chris Urmson, the former head of Google’s self-driving car project, according to a complaint filed in state court in San Jose, California. The electric-car maker seeks a court order barring Anderson, Urmson and Aurora Innovation from recruiting Tesla employees and contractors for one year after Anderson’s termination date. The Palo Alto, California-based company also wants an order blocking any use of Tesla’s proprietary information related to autonomous driving. Urmson and Anderson had not announced their start-up prior to the lawsuit. The litigation highlights a trend of voracious demand for automotive engineers working on self-driving cars, particularly within the Silicon Valley region. Small startups including Cruise Automation and Otto have been snapped up by General Motors Co and Uber Technologies Inc, while new entrants including Zoox are winning licenses to test autonomous vehicle prototypes on California roads. “Tesla’s meritless lawsuit reveals both a startling paranoia and an unhealthy fear of competition,” Aurora said in a statement on Thursday. “This abuse of the legal system is a malicious attempt to stifle a competitor and destroy personal reputations. Aurora looks forward to disproving these false allegations in court and to building a successful self-driving business.” Anderson has a PhD in mechanical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and oversaw hardware and software teams as the director of Tesla’s Autopilot program. He reported directly to Tesla chief executive officer Elon Musk. Urmson hails from Carnegie Mellon University and was the public face of Google’s self-driving car project from its early days in 2009. He left Alphabet Inc in August last year and the company has since spun off the project to form Waymo, a standalone company. Musk has said Tesla will leverage Autopilot to demonstrate full self-driving on a cross-country road trip from Los Angeles to New York by the end of this year. He has endured several legal fights during his career at Tesla. One early feud involved co-founder Martin Eberhard, who was ousted in 2007 by Musk, his biggest initial backer. In 2011, Tesla sued the British Broadcasting Corp show Top Gear for libel over a review of the Roadster model, which was later dismissed. In September, Tesla accused the chief financial officer of an ex-oil services firm executive of trying to impersonate Musk in an e-mail to get nonpublic data about the automaker.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Sat, Jan 28, 2017 - Page 5　 Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Cloud lifts Microsoft, Intel, Alphabet results Bloomberg Alphabet Inc, Microsoft Corp and Intel Corp, which all posted quarterly results on Thursday, reinforced what has become a truism in technology: The biggest growth is in businesses that deliver computing over the Internet. Microsoft topped projections on the strength of rising customer sign-ups for its cloud offerings like Azure, which saw revenue almost double. Intel sales rose more than expected, helped by orders for processors that power data-center servers — the machines at the heart of cloud computing. While profit at Google parent Alphabet disappointed, the numbers also signaled that heavy spending to catch cloud leaders Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft is paying off. Google’s Other Revenue line, which includes cloud computing, jumped 62 percent to US$3.4 billion in the fourth quarter. “Our cloud business is on a terrific upswing,” Google chief executive officer Sundar Pichai said during a conference call with analysts. “I definitely think we’re going to have a great year.” What started a decade ago as an easy way for startups to run Web sites has turned into an increasingly popular way for companies of all sizes to access the software needed to run their operations. Many big technology companies are in a strong position to provide this because they already have huge data centers to support their own Web services. More than US$1 trillion in IT spending will be directly or indirectly affected by the shift to cloud during the next five years, Gartner Inc estimated in July last year. “This will make cloud computing one of the most disruptive forces of IT spending since the early days of the digital age,” the research firm said at the time. Microsoft chief executive officer Satya Nadella has been working to reposition the company around such Internet services. In addition to robust demand for Azure, consumers and corporations continue to purchase Office 365, a cloud-based version of the company’s productivity software that includes Word and Excel. Almost 25 million consumers are now subscribed to Office 365, Microsoft said, and sales increased 47 percent in the fiscal second quarter. “As long as cloud is growing, people are happy,” Sanford C. Bernstein & Co analyst Mark Moerdler said. “If margins are growing, people are even happier.” Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft has been spending on data centers and adding products to win new cloud customers. The company has pledged to reach annualized revenue of US$20 billion in its corporate cloud business by the fiscal year that ends in June next year. Intel’s fourth-quarter sales of server chips to cloud service providers jumped 30 percent from a year earlier. Offsetting that, companies and government agencies spent 7 percent less than they had in the same quarter last year on equipping their in-house computer rooms, the company said. “It’s moving to the public cloud, it’s moving to those areas at a faster rate than I think we expected,” Intel chief executive officer Brian Krzanich said on a conference call. Amazon reports earnings next week and analysts at RBC Capital Markets expect the company’s AWS cloud business to generate US$3.6 billion in fourth-quarter revenue, up 50 percent from a year earlier. “Microsoft is the plumbing in the cloud,” Moerdler said. “Amazon is much bigger, but still Amazon and Microsoft are pulling away from the pack.” This story has been viewed 1799 times.

Screenshot by this author Bangkok, the capital of Thailand, has several green parks, but not as large as the green patch that can be seen on Google Maps today (January 27). Many Internet users were surprised to see that the whole of Bangkok and nearby provinces of the country’s western region became a massive green park on Google Map. Maybe some were hoping that the green areas of Bangkok reflect the easing of transportation congestion in the city which is notorious for its traffic jams, but a closer look at the map would reveal that Google Maps for some reason expanded the boundaries of the Thung Yai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctuary, Khao Laem National Park, and Sai Yok National Park. It was Khaosod English news website that first reported the ‘green’ glitch on Google Maps. Many parts of Thailand became a large green park on Google Map. Screenshot of Google Map by the author.

Yet Amazon.com Inc's (AMZN.O) surprise success sets up a long-term battle with Apple Inc. (AAPL.O) and Alphabet Inc's Google (GOOGL.O) for primacy in the connected household. And the contours of that competition are following a classic tech industry dynamic. Amazon is pursuing an open-systems approach that allows quick development of many features, while Apple is taking a slower route, asserting more control over the technology in order to assure security and ease-of-use. The strategic importance of the "connected home" niche looms large: Amazon wants a way to own its customer interactions -mainly shopping online - without an Apple phone or a Google Web browser as an intermediary. Apple needs to keep the iPhone at the center of customers’ lives, and has built a whole home automation architecture, called Homekit, into its smartphone. Google, for its part, is investing heavily in both intelligent assistant software and home-automation devices like the Nest thermostats and, more recently, the Google Home speaker. But Google is behind in the race, with its speaker only hitting the market in November and compatible with a handful of gadgets beyond Nest and Dropcam, which the company also owns. “When the iPhone rolled out in 2007, everyone developed [software] for that. Right now, everyone is developing for the voice-activated Internet,” said Mark Mahaney, an analyst and managing director with RBC Capital Markets. Mahaney estimates Amazon sold as many as 10 million Alexa-enabled devices over the holiday season. Google hasn't disclosed sales for its Home speaker. Apple has declined to comment on reports that it has a voice-activated speaker in the works. Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said the company is leading the industry by being the first to integrate home automation into a major platform with iOS 10. “The number of HomeKit-compatible accessories continues to grow rapidly with many exciting solutions announced just this month,” she said. For the smart home, the key developer partners are the makers of household devices ranging from lighting systems to refrigerators. There are currently about 250 devices that are certified to work with Alexa, and Amazon has encouraged rapid development of third-party applications with its open-systems approach and even financial incentives for some partners. Apple's Homekit, by contrast, has about 100 certified devices. And the reasons behind that gap show both the risks and the potential rewards of Apple's approach. HOW APPLE EXERTS CONTROL To be Homekit-certified, gadget makers must include special chips to work with Apple’s system. Developers that order small volumes of the chips say they can cost an 50 cents to $2, though prices are lower for larger buyers. Apple also requires developers to buy specific WiFi and Bluetooth networking chips that cost more than competitors. The devices have to be made in special factories that are certified by Apple. A confidential Apple document obtained by Reuters lists more than 800 of these factories, but only a few specialize in home automation products. Developers can ask Apple to certify an unlisted factory they want to use. But the limited selection means that device makers can't always get the best prices or work with their preferred factories. The founder of one startup that considered pursuing HomeKit approval for a device that helps control home temperatures said the company picked a factory with 40,000 employees that was making well known "Star Wars" toys, but it couldn't use that factory for HomeKit products. "They're a huge company, a legitimate manufacturer that makes tech household brands. And yet they're not [Apple] certified," said the founder, who declined to speak on the record because of non-disclosure agreements with Apple. Manufacturers also have to send product samples to Cupertino, where Apple tests them extensively for compatibility. The whole process can take three to five months. During that time, device makers aren't allowed to say publicly that they're pursuing HomeKit certification. Some developers say it's worth it. "They found issues with our product before we released it that we didn't find in our testing," said Gimmy Chu, CEO of Nanoleaf, a smart lighting system. "We know that after we have the certification that it's rock solid." AMAZON'S "OPEN" APPROACH Alexa, by contrast, only requires smart home companies to write software code and submit it to Amazon for review. There are no special chips. To earn the "Works with Alexa" label -which isn’t required to function with Alexa but does help promote products on Amazon’s website - startups must have their products physically tested. Amazon does allow that to happen in a third-party lab, however. Once those certifications are in hand, Amazon says it will decide whether or not a device gets the “Works with Alexa” label within 10 days. Apple's approach has some clear advantages when it comes to privacy, security and ease-of-use. HomeKit gadgets, for example, can operate without being connected to the Internet. (An iPad or Apple TV connected to the Internet is required if you want to control devices when you’re outside the house.) “It also makes for a better user experience,” notes Ahmed Abdallah, a senior engineer at Incipio, which makes HomeKit-compatible devices such as electrical outlets. “You’ll experience some latency if you’re always having to bounce off the cloud” as with Alexa. Apple also has an advantage around setup. iPhone owners open up the Home app and set up a device with just a few taps. With Alexa, customers have to download the gadget’s companion app first, set up the device, then add a “skill” to Alexa in the Alexa app. Apple's ease of setup lured in some big brands like Hunter Fan Company, the top-selling ceiling fan maker in the U.S. “If that experience isn’t good, it has a strong negative halo on the brand because customers just assume the product is bad,” said John Neilson, the company’s chief marketing officer. Amazon acknowledges that unlike Apple, it can't guarantee the security of third-party devices. A company spokeswoman did note that sensitive commands like unlocking doors have an extra layer of security such as a voice-controlled PIN. Still, it's not clear whether Apple's elaborate but slow-to-develop system will have enough advantages to overcome Amazon's widening lead. “The danger I see for Apple and the home is they’re assuming that because I have a smartphone that may be an Apple device, that alone is enough of a Trojan horse to establish their mindshare,” said Andreas Stavropoulos, a partner at venture capital firm DFJ. “I wouldn’t say that's certain yet.” (Editing by Jonathan Weber and Edward Tobin) FILE PHOTO: An Apple logo hangs above the entrance to the Apple store on 5th Avenue in the Manhattan borough of New York City, July 21, 2015.

ByLarry Dignan for Between the Lines | January 27, 2017 -- 16:24 GMT (08:24 PST) | Topic: Artificial Intelligence Apple is joining the Partnership on AI, a group that aims to create best practices for artificial intelligence, keep an open dialogue with experts, and ponder how society and business can benefit. special feature How to Implement AI and Machine Learning The next wave of IT innovation will be powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning. We look at the ways companies can take advantage of it and how to get started. Read More That's the quick headline, but what's more interesting about Apple joining the Partnership on AI is the company it will keep. Founding members of the Partnership on AI include Amazon, DeepMind, Google, Facebook, IBM, Microsoft, and OpenAI, as well as nonprofit groups such as the ACLU of Massachusetts. At first glance, you wonder if Apple fits in with that group. That initial reaction highlights both the challenge -- perception and reality -- Apple faces in artificial intelligence, deep learning, and automation. Apple recently started talking up AI, but is widely seen as a laggard relative to Google. Also: Apple adds Carnegie Mellon prof to aid AI research Every tech giant in the Partnership on AI has been talking about the technology for years. IBM has Watson. Microsoft is building AI into its cloud. Amazon has Alexa and Amazon Web Services. Facebook uses AI for everything from image classification to personalization. Google's cloud and Android differentiation revolves around AI and machine learning. Richard Windsor, an analyst at Edison Investment Research, said we're near the peak of AI bluster. We are looking for companies that are addressing the three real challenges of AI as it is the solution of these problems that will allow the quality and richness of services to really evolve. Our research finds that it is the search engines, Google, Baidu and Yandex that lead this field because they have been doing it the longest. Everyone else is scrambling as fast as they can to catch up and are making an increasing amount of noise at the same time. We expect to see feverish M&A activity in 2017 as AI currently takes so long to create that many players may feel they have no other choice than to acquire. In comparison, Apple is relatively new to the AI bandwagon. The stakes are high. Now the Partnership on AI gives Apple good optics and maybe a pipeline into research to recruit experts. The official Partnership on AI mission statement goes like this: In support of the mission to benefit people and society, the Partnership on AI intends to conduct research, organize discussions, share insights, provide thought leadership, consult with relevant third parties, respond to questions from the public and media, and create educational material that advance the understanding of AI technologies including machine perception, learning, and automated reasoning. The Partnership on AI will also support best practices, boost awareness to the public, and provide a discussion platform. In other words, the goals to date are a bit mushy, but may work out for Apple. Meanwhile, there are a bevy of other groups focused on AI. The Partnership on AI meets February 3 in what's a crowded market for think tanks. IBM CEO Ginny Rometty recently outlined transparency thoughts for AI. She's not alone. MIT, Harvard, and LinkedIn's Reid Hoffman, among others, joined together for a $27 million fund to ponder the implications of AI. The Obama Administration recently issued a report on AI's impact on jobs, and entities such as Carnegie Mellon, a non-profit backed by tech giants, and IEEE have also sounded off. We'll see what the Partnership on AI and its board, which is loaded with AI luminaries, cooks up going forward.

Asus Chromebook Flip More from Fast Cities Here's How We Know 440,000 People Attended The Women's March In D.C. The Science And Politics Of Counting The Crowds At The Inauguration And Women's March Hold The Storefront: How Delivery-Only "Ghost" Restaurants Are Changing Takeout Jared Newman 01.24.17 10:00 AM Google is trying to extend its lead in classroom computer sales by bringing Android apps to Chromebooks for education. School administrators will soon be able to create lists of approved apps and install them onto students' laptops. Android apps are arriving this month in beta for a handful of Chromebook models, similar to last year's rollout on consumer Chromebooks. Android apps could address one of the biggest complaints about Chromebooks—which is that the operating system, while simple and secure, is too limiting. Until now, Chromebooks have only been able to visit websites and run a relatively small number of web-based apps. The update will allow schools to choose from millions of apps in the Google Play Store. Google Play for Chromebooks "Bringing these two things together means that many, many students that are going to be using Chromebooks in the classroom will now have many more things that they can do with those Chromebooks," says Rajen Sheth, Google's senior director of product management for Android and Chrome for education and enterprise. But making Android apps work in an education setting is more complicated than bringing those apps to consumers. Here's what Google has (and, in some cases, hasn't quite) figured out as part of its Android app push for schools: Acer Chromebook 11 N7 New Hardware Was Necessary While dozens of older Chromebooks will become compatible with Android apps, Google and device makers are also launching new hardware to take advantage of the software. Acer's Chromebook Spin 11, which is launching this spring, has a screen that flips around 360 degrees, and a camera just above the keyboard. Students can hold up the Chromebook like a tablet and shoot video on the opposite side of the screen. "That way, you can turn this device into a microscope, or you can turn it into a video camera, you can turn it into a lot of things that are needed for students in the classroom," Sheth says. Acer's Chromebook also has active Wacom stylus support, allowing for pressure-sensitive digital pens that don't need batteries and only cost a few bucks each. "Students can actually share these styluses and replace the styluses inexpensively," Sheth says. "Things like that are really important." The App Install Process Needs Optimizing Part of Chromebooks' allure is how quickly they get up and running. Because everything's web-based, students can log in and have all their apps and accounts ready to go, but that speed isn't guaranteed if the system has to install a bunch of Android apps with every session. With the addition of Android apps, Sheth says Google had to make "a variety of optimizations" to keep things speedy. While there is a small delay in being able to access Android apps when students first log in, the Chromebook should still be able to access the web in the meantime. "You can get in and up and running and working in less than 10 seconds, and then start to access your Android apps, but we're going to continue take that further, and make continued improvements and continued optimizations," Sheth says. To that end, Google is looking at ways to avoid re-downloading entire apps every time a student logs in. Presumably, if one classroom is pushing the same apps to every Chromebook, it might make sense to leave those apps installed, while wiping individual students' data between sessions. "We know that every student logging in on that device will access that same application. Are there things we can do to optimize that and not have to re-download the application? Those are things we're going to be working on down the line" for Chromebooks, Sheth says. Android Apps Could Use Some Tweaking Nearly every Android app was built with phones and tablets in mind, rather than the big screens, keyboards, and trackpads that come standard on Chromebooks. While Google has tried to work around this—for instance, by simulating touch input through trackpad clicks—the company is also trying to convince developers to make their apps more laptop-friendly. "We've actually created a list of all the key applications, and over the course of the last year we've reached out to developers who haven't optimized their apps for this kind of form factor," Sheth says. One of those developers is Adobe, which has tweaked the Android versions of its Creative Cloud apps, including Photoshop Mix, Lightroom Mobile, Illustrator Draw, Photoshop Sketch, Adobe Comp CC, and Creative Cloud Mobile. Optimizations in these apps include landscape mode and formatting for larger displays, keyboard shortcuts, proper support for the Esc key, and support for Chromebooks' cameras and image galleries. Granted, the push to make Android apps more accommodating to laptops will affect consumer Chromebooks as well as classroom ones. But Chromebooks are much stronger in the education market, making up 54% of Q3 2016 shipments to K-12 classrooms in the United States according to IDC. Developers might have a greater incentive to add keyboard, trackpad, and big screen support if their apps have any educational appeal. Perhaps that will set the stage for a big consumer Chromebook push this year. "As these devices get out there, I think the developer community will start to optimize even more," Sheth says.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has been working to reposition the company around cloud services.  (Richard Drew / The Associated Press file photo)   By Alistair Barr Jillian WardBloomberg Fri., Jan. 27, 2017 Alphabet Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Intel Corp., which all posted quarterly results Thursday, reinforced what’s become a truism in technology: the biggest growth is in businesses that deliver computing over the Internet. Microsoft topped projections on the strength of rising customer sign-ups for its cloud offerings like Azure, which saw revenue almost double. Intel sales rose more than expected, helped by orders for processors that power data-centre servers — the machines at the heart of cloud computing. While profit at Google parent Alphabet disappointed, the numbers also signalled that heavy spending to catch cloud leaders Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft is paying off. Google’s Other Revenue line, which includes cloud computing, jumped 62 per cent to $3.4 billion (U.S.) in the fourth quarter. “Our cloud business is on a terrific upswing,” Google chief executive officer Sundar Pichai said Thursday during a conference call with analysts. “I definitely think we’re going to have a great year.” What started a decade ago as an easy way for startups to run websites has turned into an increasingly popular way for companies of all sizes to access the software needed to run their operations. Many big technology companies are in a strong position to provide this because they already have huge data centres to support their own web services. Article Continued Below More than $1 trillion in IT spending will be directly or indirectly affected by the shift to cloud during the next five years, Gartner Inc. estimated in July. “This will make cloud computing one of the most disruptive forces of IT spending since the early days of the digital age,” the research firm said at the time. Stock prices reflect this optimism. Microsoft and Alphabet shares hit a record this week, and Intel stock recently came close to an all-time high set in October. In early trading Friday, Microsoft was up 1.6 per cent, Google was down 1.1 per cent and Intel gained less than 1 per cent. Microsoft chief executive officer Satya Nadella has been working to reposition the company around such Internet services. In addition to robust demand for Azure, consumers and corporations continue to purchase Office 365, a cloud-based version of the company’s productivity software that includes Word and Excel. Almost 25 million consumers are now subscribed to Office 365, Microsoft said, and sales increased 47 per cent in the fiscal second quarter.  “As long as cloud is growing, people are happy,” said Mark Moerdler, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. “If margins are growing, people are even happier.” Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft has been spending on data centres and adding products to win new cloud customers. chief financial officer Amy Hood said in July that gross margins, a measure of profitability, for the commercial cloud business would “materially improve” in the current year. That’s because previous years of investment are starting to pay off as those data centres support more customers. Microsoft has pledged to reach annualized revenue of $20 billion in its corporate cloud business by the fiscal year that ends in June 2018. That metric stood at more than $14 billion at the end of the second quarter. Intel’s fourth-quarter sales of server chips to cloud service providers jumped 30 per cent from a year earlier. Offsetting that, companies and government agencies spent 7 per cent less than they had in the same quarter in 2016 on equipping their in-house computer rooms, the company said. “It’s moving to the public cloud, it’s moving to those areas at a faster rate than I think we expected,” Intel chief executive officer Brian Krzanich said on a conference call.  Amazon reports earnings next week and analysts at RBC Capital Markets expect the company’s AWS cloud business to generate $3.6 billion in fourth-quarter revenue, up 50 per cent from a year earlier. “Microsoft is the plumbing in the cloud,” Moerdler said. “Amazon is much bigger, but still Amazon and Microsoft are pulling away from the pack.” Read more about: Apple, Microsoft Delivered dailyThe Morning Headlines Newsletter Subscribe The Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E 1E6.

Samsung Mobile by Gordon Gottsegen January 25, 2017 2:33 PM PST Up Next Meet Jon Hamm, the hologram (aka the holohamm) Competition may be good for the soul, but so is collaboration. Samsung said at an earnings call earlier Wednesday that working with its often-partner, sometimes-rival Google will make artificial intelligence better on a range of devices. "Samsung and Google will have to continue to maintain their strategic partnership to nurture the AI and the market for the emerging technology," Samsung Mobile VP Lee Kyeong-tae said, as reported by The Investor, a South Korean publication associated with The Korea Herald. The call to collaborate comes at a time when Samsung is rumored to bring the AI assistant "Bixby" to its Galaxy S8 phone this April. The use of AI is heating up on phones, with phonemakers from Huawei to HTC introducing their own takes. Google, too, has already gotten a head start with its Google Assistant for the Pixel phones. If Google's AI played a role in the Pixel's success, then it be a win-win for Samsung and Google to work together: Samsung gets the smarts, Google gets more data to keep improving. Did Samsung just leak the Galaxy S8? Two new videos from Samsung's display division show off a new phone that might be the upcoming Galaxy S8. by Lexy Savvides 1:09 Close Drag Samsung's AI assistant wouldn't be limited to the Galaxy S8, either. Bixby could come to the company's tablets, TVs and laptops, too. In addition, Samsung may offer its AI to third-party developers, much as Amazon did with Alexa, The Investor noted. Investing in AI may also be a way for Samsung to diversify its efforts. After Samsung was (almost literally) burned by the Note 7, the company said it will work on other technology in addition to phones. "Although the growth of the global smartphone market is expected to slow this year, new services such as artificial intelligence will be a differentiating factor," Samsung said in a press release. Adding features like AI to high-end models is one way for the company to try to outpace competitors.

And we loved Google’s Pixel and Pixel XL phones, because they did exactly the same thing. See related  iPhone 8 (7s) UK release date, price and rumours: 5 things you NEED to know Samsung Galaxy S8 UK release date and news: S8 will cut bezels for its ‘infinity’ display, report claims Released last year, the Pixel and Pixel XL were a great marriage of Google designed hardware, and a vanilla Nougat OS – but they did fall short against competitors like the iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge. It looks like the Google Pixel 2 should be here by the end of the year, and when it arrives it’ll need to improve in several areas if it’s to compete with the iPhone 7S and Galaxy S8. Google Pixel 2: Release date Google hasn’t yet revealed when the Google Pixel 2 is coming out, but it usually updates its smartphones on an annual basis. And that means we can predict the release date of the Google Pixel 2 by looking at when the original Google Pixel phone came out.  The Google Pixel actually came out in October 2016, we should see the Google Pixel 2 released in Q4 of this year – just in time for Christmas. With that in mind, here’s something things we need to see from the Google Pixel 2:  Google Pixel 2: The features and specs we need to see 1. More engaging design The Google Pixel is a handsome phone, but you can be forgiven for finding it a little, well, boring. Although we liked subtle touches like its matte and gloss finish, it’s clear Google has played things very safe – and from a distance it’s hard to tell the Google flagship apart from the Apple one. Compare that to the Samsung S7, which has managed to carve its own, stylish niche –and it’s even more apparent that the Google Pixel 2 needs to look better, and bolder too. 2. Mure durable finish The Google Pixel came with a unique finish that matched matte with gloss, but after only a few hours we started to notice hairline scratches on both the Pixel and Pixel XL we were reviewing. If Google won’t give us the option of a completely matte Google Pixel 2, it’ll need to make sure its finish is far more durable. 3. Brighter screen The Google Pixel has one of the best displays screens we’ve used, simply because it’s so colourful and vibrant. However, its AMOLED screen isn’t anywhere near as bright as its competitors. The Google Pixel has a peak brightness of 411cd/m2, while the Samsung's S7 and S7 Edge peak at around 500cd/m2 in auto-brightness mode. If the Google Pixel 2 wants to lead the field, it’s going to need a brighter screen. 4. Faster processor The Google Pixel is fast, but the Google Pixel 2 will need to be much faster. Our Pixel XL had a Geekbench 4 score of 1,546 in the single-core test and 4,142 in the multicore test, which is pretty good. However, the Samsung S7 and S7 Edge and the iPhone 7 were still a way out in front, mind, with all three handsets reaching over 5,000 in Geekbench 4's multi-core test. If the Pixel 2 is to compete with the Samsung Galaxy S8 and the iPhone 7s, it’ll need to have a much faster processpr than the one it currently uses. After all, Samsung and Apple are rumoured to be pulling out all the stops for their next range of smartphones. 5. Better battery life The Google Pixel actually had a good amount of battery life, but unfortunately for Google, it wasn’t class leading. Despite having a t 2,770mAh battery, the Pixel lasted an impressive 16hrs 23mins in our rigorous battery test, while the Pixel XL's 3,450mAh battery, which lasted a still highly respectable 15hrs 55mins. However, both scores start to look a little less impressive when compared with some of their rivals. The Samsung Galaxy S7, for instance, lasted 17hrs 48mins, and the S7 Edge achieved an even more outstanding 18hrs 42mins. There's also the OnePlus 3 to consider, which lasted 16hrs 56 mins under the same conditions. If the Google Pixel 2 is going to beat a new wave of flagships, it’s going to need to squeeze a much larger battery into its chassis.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 27 January 2017 | MYT 8:34 PM Alphabet posts strong revenue growth, higher taxes hit earnings Gaining traction: Google-branded hardware shows promise. — Reuters Google parent Alphabet Inc posted fourth-quarter profit below analysts' estimates on Jan 26, hurt by a higher tax rate, but analysts cheered the company's progress in diversifying its business beyond advertising. While advertising still accounts for the lion's share of Google's revenue, rising 17.4% to US$22.4bil (RM99.27bil) in the quarter, Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat underscored that the company is broadening its business – pointing to growth in hardware, app sales and the cloud business. The company's other revenue, which captures such businesses, climbed 62% to US$3.4bil (RM15.07bil). "We see tremendous potential ahead for these businesses, as well as in the continued development of non-advertising revenue streams for YouTube," Porat said on a call with investors. The results were met with a mixed reaction from Wall Street, which sent shares down 2.2% to US$838 (RM3,713.60) in extended trade after closing at US$856.98 (RM3,797.71) on Nasdaq. Google faced a higher tax rate of 22%, compared to 19% for the year overall, contributing to the dent in profitability. "If you look above that, it’s business as usual," said analyst James Wang of ARK Investment Management. "There has been no margin compression in the actual business." Executives suggested that they are beginning to reap the rewards of their investment in hardware. Porat spotlighted the company's line of Nest smart home products, saying sales doubled during the key holiday period including Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Google-branded hardware also showed promise as Google Home, a smart speaker, and the Pixel smartphone gained traction over the holidays, Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said during the call. "We’re committed to this for the long term as a great way to bring a beautiful, seamless Google experience to people," he said. The company posted a stronger-than-expected 22.2% increase in quarterly revenue as advertisers spent more to reach an expanding user base that spends more time on smartphones and YouTube. Research firm eMarketer has estimated that Google will capture US$60.92bil (RM269.97bil) in search ad revenue this year, or 58.8% of the search ad market worldwide. Paid clicks, or clicks on Google ads, rose 36%, compared with a 33% increase in the third quarter. Paid clicks are those ads on which an advertiser pays only if a user clicks on them. Analysts on average had expected a rise of 26.9%, according to FactSet StreetAccount. Cost-per-click dropped 9%, a slide that has continued as Google sells more mobile ads, which command lower prices. However, the shift is not necessarily alarming as it suggests Google is selling more ads on YouTube, which are seen as a key growth driver, Rice said. Alphabet's Other Bets revenue increased to US$262mil (RM1.16bil) from US$150mil (RM664.72mil) a year earlier, while the operating loss of US$1.09bil (RM4.83bil) narrowed from US$1.21bil (RM5.36bil). Other Bets includes broadband business Google Fiber, home automation products Nest, self-driving technology company Waymo as well as X, the company's research facility that works on "moon shot" ventures. Verily Life Sciences, one such bet, announced on Jan 26 that Singapore-based investment company Temasek had invested US$800mil (RM3.55bil) for a minority stake in the company. The investment reflects Alphabet's greater fiscal discipline under Porat and suggests a potential new model for the other bets, said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research. "Getting external investors involved helps spread that risk out and reduces Google’s exposure," he said. "It also allows some things to move faster than they would if it were just Google's cash backing them." Alphabet's net income rose to US$5.33bil (RM23.62bil), or US$7.56 (RM33.50) per Class A and B share and Class C capital stock, in the fourth quarter, from US$4.92bil (RM21.8bil), or US$7.06 (RM31.29) per share, a year earlier. See graphic on earnings. Excluding items, the company earned US$9.36 (RM41.48) per share, below the average estimate of US$9.64 (RM42.72) per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company's consolidated revenue rose to US$26.06bil (RM115.48bil) above the average estimate of US$25.26bil (RM111.94bil). — Reuters You May Be Interested China girlfriend rental app gets leg up from Lunar New Year demand Microsoft profit up as demand for cloud service soars AppDynamics deal shows buyouts more lucrative in anemic IPO market Bring cheer to the underprivileged this festive season Go purple this CNY if you want to get lucky in love Six simple steps to feng shui your home Others Also Read Ponkan oranges choice of the season Tortoises at Kek Lok Si Temple get new home Pacesetting Rose blooms as Woods fades at Torrey Pines advertisement Latest News China turns to blockchain to make markets clearer and cleaner Coming soon: Robot DoorDash deliveries PayPal outlook muted on mobile competition, currency trends Alphabet posts strong revenue growth, higher taxes hit earnings Russian security service says hackers attacked major banks in 2016 Most Viewed in Tech China turns to blockchain to make markets clearer and cleaner Chinese Lunar New Year ticket snatching apps raise hackles Coming soon: Robot DoorDash deliveries China girlfriend rental app gets leg up from Lunar New Year demand Microsoft profit up as demand for cloud service soars Facing huge writedown, battered Toshiba decides to sell part of memory chip business STMicro to supply iPhone 8 parts?

"Google is a company that has a large part ... of their cash offshore right now, so there's an opportunity to bring some of that back," said Munster, managing partner at Loup Ventures. "I think more thematically how [President Donald] Trump has talked about technology hasn't been very supportive of some of that, but I don't think that changes the momentum that companies like Google and Facebook and Apple and Amazon can still do in terms of innovation." Companies that don't sell hardware products like phones may be more affected by Trump's sentiment toward technology investing, Munster said. But while Alphabet posted mixed results with worse-than-expected earnings on Thursday night, Munster said its underlying search business is "right where it needs to be." "Google is a great bellwether, and the health of Google, right now, is strong," Munster said on "Squawk on the Street."

Here's a look at the key numbers: Revenue rose 22% to $26.06 billion ($25.2 billion expected) Adjusted earnings of $9.36 per share ($9.67 expected) Paid clicks jumped 43% year over year Cost-per-click on Google properties fell -16% year over year Other Bets revenues climbed 74.7% to $262 million   Google’s mobile search and video ads boosted revenue in the fourth quarter, but increased spending on hardware and other new businesses, as well as a larger-than-expected tax rate, weighed on the bottom line. In addition to the hard numbers, investors had their eyes on Alphabet's "Other Bets" —  the separate companies focused on ambitious new projects from self-driving cars to biotech. Alphabet ended several projects and lost many top executives and leaders during the back half of 2016. The moves were designed to help cut costs from Other Bets, which have yet to generate any meaningful revenue for Alphabet. During the earnings call, Google CEO Sundar Pichai touched a lot on Google's main new areas of investment like hardware, cloud services, and YouTube. However, Pichai wouldn't give any hard numbers for subscribers to paid YouTube services like YouTube Red or YouTube Music, saying only it was "early days" for those products.

Apple joins the fight to extend and control AI. Image: MIL pictures/AP By Lance Ulanoff2017-01-27 15:54:42 UTC Artificial Intelligence has another champion and watchdog. Four months after its formation, the Partnership on AI, a group dedicated to tackling AI opportunities and challenges finally, officially welcomed Apple as a member. Tom Gruber, Apple's head of advanced development for Apple's digital assistant, Siri, joined the Partnership on AI's board of Trustees on Friday.  SEE ALSO: How the scary potential of AI brought tech competitors together Gruber joins science, research and AI leaders from a disparate group of companies including Google, Amazon, Microsoft, IBM and DeepMind (part of Google), along with leaders from the ACLU, UC Berkeley and the Association for the Advancement of AI. "We’re glad to see the industry engaging on some of the larger opportunities and concerns created with the advance of machine learning and AI. We believe it’s beneficial to Apple, our customers, and the industry to play an active role in its development and look forward to collaborating with the group to help drive discussion on how to advance AI while protecting the privacy and security of consumers.” said Gruber on the Partnership on AI site. Apple joins as a founding member, even though it wasn't a part of the original group announced back in September. That's because, as the company revealed to me last year, it was already quietly working with the group, though not in an official capacity. That changed on Friday. The work to make sure AI develops in a useful, safe and fair way may be even more important now. It may also be the exact right time for Apple to get involved, since the Partnership on AI hasn't done much since its formation. Its last update was a public statement in October praising the White House Office of Science and Technology's report on the future of artificial intelligence, a document now archived as part of the Obama White House website. At the time, the Partnership on AI applauded the report, adding, "We agree that AI can be a major driver of growth and social progress. Harnessing advances in AI to their fullest potential will involve collaboration by industry, government, and the public on the broader social, legal, and ethical influences of AI." Since then, it's been publicly silent. However, the addition of Apple marks, the group noted in its latest blog post, "a pivotal moment for the Partnership on AI, as we establish a diverse and balanced Board of Trustees that extends and broadens our existing leadership." In addition, a Partnership AI representative told me in an email, "In the months since launch, we’ve been working with colleagues and partners from a range of disciplines to start building out a robust and multi-stakeholder organization. We are pleased that we have now been able to deliver on our promise to have a Board with equal representation between the company Trustees and Independent Trustees." And the work to make sure AI develops in a useful, safe and fair way may be even more important now. When I spoke to Partnership on AI founding member and Microsoft Research Technical Fellow and Managing Director Eric Horvitz last fall, he explained that the risk of inadvertent bias in AI systems is a real concern. “Bias in data can get propagated to machine learning that can lead to bias systems,” Horvitz told me last year. It could, he warned, impact “how racial minorities are handled when it comes to visual perception and facial recognition.” The group had no comment on how the President Donald Trump administration's approach to science might impact their work. The very first meeting of the Partnership on AI's Board of Trustees will take place on Feb. 3 in San Francisco, near where Apple, Facebook and Google are based. After the meeting, a company spokesperson told me, they should announce more details, "including how other people and organizations can participate, as well as the initial program of research and activities."

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Chrome OS tablets may be in the works 01/24/2017 at 12:30 PM by Brad Linder Leave a Comment Rumors of a Chrome OS tablet have been making the rounds for years. But 2017 might be the year we finally see one… well, depending on your definition of a tablet. Last year’s Asus Chromebook Flip is arguably the first convertible Chromebook tablet, and a number of other convertibles with built-in keyboards have been released since the Flip first launched. But this year we may see models with detachable keyboards or no keyboard at all. Acer Chromebook Spin 11 Google unveiled two new convertible Chromebooks today, noting that they’re aimed at the education market and feature support for pen input. But The Verge reports that yesterday Google’s Android and Chrome product director Rajen Seth made an interesting comment during a conference call ahead of today’s announcement “You may expect everything from detachables to tablets based on Chrome OS down the line.” Up until recently, Google has drawn a pretty firm line between its Android and Chrome operating systems: Chrome was for notebooks and desktops, and Android was for smartphones and tablets (and TVs and watches, kind of). But now you can run Android apps on a Chrome OS device… blurring the distinction between the two operating systems. And that comes at a time when Windows device makers have been blurring the lines between tablets and notebooks thanks to the rise of 2-in-1 devices with detachable and built-in keyboards in recent years. Chrome OS has support touchscreen input for several years, including an on-screen keyboard and handwriting recognition which make it possible to run the operating system on devices that don’t have a keyboard. Support for Android apps brings all the benefits of native apps (including the ability to get work done while you’re offline), as well as support for the full Chrome desktop browser that allows you to view desktop versions of websites and install extensions to expand the capabilities of the browser. Sure, there are still some things that you can do on a Windows or Mac computer that aren’t supported out-of-the-box on a Chrome OS device. But it’s getting harder to say that Chrome OS isn’t a “real” operating system… and if you’re skeptical, you could always wipe the OS and install an alternative. But you don’t even need to do that, since Chrome OS lets you enable a developer mode that makes it possible to run Ubuntu, Debian, or other Linux-based operating systems on a Chromebook without uninstalling Chrome OS (or even rebooting the device).

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple's Negotiations with India Could get tangled in Tax Issues from Individual States where Apple sets up Shop | Main | It's Official, Apple moving iTunes International from Luxembourg to Cork Ireland » January 27, 2017 The Digital Assistant War for Home Automation Device Supremacy is about to get Really Heated   "In less than a year, Amazon's combination of the Echo speaker system and the Alexa voice-controlled digital assistant has come close to delivering on the elusive promise of easy-to-use technology that can control gadgets in the home with a few spoken words. Yet Amazon's surprise success with Echo sets up a long-term battle with Apple and Alphabet's Google for primacy in the connected household. And the contours of that competition are following a classic tech industry dynamic," Reuters reports.   "Amazon is pursuing an open-systems approach that allows quick development of many features, while Apple is taking a slower route, asserting more control over the technology in order to assure security and ease-of-use. The strategic importance of the 'connected home' niche looms large: Amazon wants a way to own its customer interactions - mainly shopping online - without an Apple phone or a Google Web browser as an intermediary.  Apple needs to keep the iPhone at the center of customers' lives, and has built a whole home automation architecture, called HomeKit, into its smartphone."   Stephen Nellis reporting for Reuters further noted that "Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said the company is leading the industry by being the first to integrate home automation into a major platform with iOS 10. 'The number of HomeKit-compatible accessories continues to grow rapidly with many exciting solutions announced just this month.'    For the smart home, the key developer partners are the makers of household devices ranging from lighting systems to refrigerators. There are currently about 250 devices that are certified to work with Alexa, and Amazon has encouraged rapid development of third-party applications with its open-systems approach and even financial incentives for some partners.   Apple's HomeKit, by contrast, has about 100 certified devices. And the reasons behind that gap show both the risks and the potential rewards of Apple's approach." Read the full Reuters report here as they continue the report showing the two approaches to market Apple and Amazon have, as in one is closed while the other is open.   While the article touched on Google Home using Google Assistant that could be another winner in this category of device driven by digital assistants, others are bound to be entering the market over time such as Samsung who will be introducing their digital assistant 'Bixby' with the release of the galaxy S8. Samsung's Viv based technology will be used in vehicle infotainment systems, home appliances and likely an Echo-like device.   Lastly, Microsoft's digital assistant Cortana will be supported by many Echo-like devices, with one specific one debuting later this year from Harman Kardon as we noted in graphic below from our report last Friday about this very topic.   While Microsoft's CEO Satya Nadella downplayed Microsoft entering the home-automation device market directly due to the Harman Kardon device, a new patent filing surfacing this week proved that Microsoft is at least working on a next-gen type of home-automation device that is far more advanced than the Echo. Our report on this invention will be posted later this morning.(See: A Microsoft Patent Reveals a Highly Advanced Home Automation Device that's Miles ahead of Amazon's Echo)   In the end, Reuters report is interesting and helpful in helping us see how the war for the home is about to get very fierce as tech companies fight for supremacy of the living room / TV room. But the Reuters report limits the war between Android and iOS. Yet the war is going to expand beyond those platforms through to Microsoft's Windows and likely Samsung's Tizen this year and beyond. So there's a long way to go before we see who are going to be the top five system vendors in the U.S. and around the globe.   There's probably more potential here for Apple then their current Apple Watch, so hopefully we'll see rumors turn into facts later this year.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Here’s the rundown: Story Continued Below — WHAT ABOUT TRUMP? President Donald Trump has made some pretty pointed comments about the AT&T-Time Warner merger, suggesting to some he might try to play a hands-on role with antitrust. Asked about it, Ohlhausen said she found it “heartening” that Trump is focused on “making sure that there’s economic opportunity for all, and I’m a big proponent of economic liberty… and antitrust enforcers need to be ready to intervene when businesses interrupt the compettive process.” But the FTC is supposed to be an independent agency, and pressed about whether Trump would meddle, she responded: “I’m not concerned about the independence of the FTC. I think people understand our role and respect our role, and I imagine that will continue.” — SO WHAT’S HER EARLY THINKING? “I would like to certainly increase our advocacy on behalf of reducing barriers to competition, barriers to new businesses,” Ohlhausen said. “And then on the consumer protection side, I’m very interested in some of the scams and some of the problems that small business face.” So we asked for an example of this stuff. “One area in particular really fascinates me,” she began, “and that’s actually telehealth, and some of the issues there where you have state licensing requirements or state limits on how nurse practitioners can practice, or where the doctor has to be to allow telehealth to happen.” Ohlhausen took care to note that Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) has a bill to this effect focused on military personnel and veterans. — ON THAT QUALCOMM CASE: Outgoing Chairwoman Edith Ramirez, in her final days in the job, brought a massive antitrust case against the chipmaker for the way it licenses technologies that are essential for smartphones to function. Ohlhausen dissented, however, arguing the FTC should not have done this in the opening moments of the Trump administration. Now that she’s in charge,Ohlhausen repeated her belief the case lacks some legal footing, but said, for now, she “wanted to explore my options.” (What she didn’t say: With Ramirez’s departure, the FTC is about to be a 1-1, deadlocked commission, and a change in course would need the support of her colleague, Democratic Commissioner Terrell McSweeny, who voted to proceed with a case.) Asked about Apple, which filed its own lawsuit against Qualcomm, Ohlhausen declined to comment. — THE FUTURE OF NET NEUTRALITY: It was only a few days ago that Ohlhausen released a new paper explaining how antitrust law is a solid way to address open internet issues without the need to subject internet providers to utility-like regulation. “Certainly it is up to Chairman Pai and his leadership at the FCC, and Congress, to figure out what’s the right path ahead with net neutrality, but the thing is, the antitrust laws continue,” Ohlhausen said. The FTC is awaiting a court decision that’ll clarify its authority over common carriers (aka much of telecom), which it’s generally not supposed to touch under law. And while Ohlhausen said she’s discussed ending this exemption with lawmakers in recent weeks, the Justice Department “isn’t hampered” from bringing a net neutrality complaint on competition grounds. — AND THEN THERE’S GOOGLE: For years, Google critics have tried to get the FTC to revive its antitrust probe of the search and advertising giant. Asked about it, Ohlhausen wouldn’t comment on Google – but did say, generally: “If there’s evidence of anticompetitive conduct and consumer harm, I want to hear about it.” HAPPY FRIDAY MORNING and welcome to Morning Tech, where we’re eyeing all these restaurants.

TRUMP, THERESA MAY AND TECH — U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May is scheduled to meet with Trump today and we’re tracking for mentions of all things tech. One key subject that’s expected to come up is trade policy and the digital trade relationship between the two countries. Additionally, May and Trump could touch on another issue that affects the tech industry domestically and across the pond: in both regions, companies are concerned that limitations on immigration for high-skilled workers could hurt their businesses. May also recently announced extensive investment in R&D for “industries of the future,” including areas like smart energy, robotics and artificial intelligence, Pro Europe’s Fiona Maxwell reports. — Some of the issues on tech’s mind: Ensuring that a new U.S.-U.K. trade agreement sets a high standard for digital trade that could be used as an example for other, future agreements and making sure the U.K.’s Brexit negotiations don’t disrupt digital trade in Europe are two key priorities tech is keeping tabs on during this meeting, according to an industry official. CTA President and CEO Gary Shapiro also called out the importance of finalizing such an agreement. “Since Brexit I have repeatedly and publicly urged the U.S. and Britain to enter a bilateral trade agreement,” he told MT, in a statement. “While it may not go into effect until Britain leaves the EU, this would be a big achievement for leaders of both countries.” — Trade and commerce will also be the focal point of a meeting Trump has scheduled for this morning, in advance of his discussions with May. The White House did not say who would participate in that meeting. ROSS VOTE COULD COME SOON — A Senate vote on Commerce Secretary-nominee Wilbur Ross’s confirmation could come as soon as next week, although Republicans haven't officially scheduled one yet, according to a Senate Democratic aide. Ross had a fairly smooth confirmation hearing and was approved by the Senate Commerce Committee on Tuesday. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s office said it didn’t have a scheduling announcement yet as of Thursday afternoon. A Senate vote to invoke cloture on the confirmation of Secretary of State-nominee Rex Tillerson is slated for Monday and a vote for Transportation Secretary-nominee Elaine Chao is set for Tuesday.

Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee’s antitrust subcommittee who’s shared concerns about the AT&T-Time Warner deal, said Senate lawmakers would have a role in reviewing a potential merger between Charter and Verizon. “I have fought hard to promote competition across a broad range of industries and sectors – including media and telecom – because competition protects consumers and fosters innovation,” she told MT in a statement. “A potential acquisition of Charter by Verizon would raise concerns about its potential impact on consumers across our country and would merit close scrutiny by regulators and the subcommittee.” The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that the two companies were in early talks about a possible deal that would unite the telecom and cable giants. SANDBERG SPEAKS OUT AGAINST TRUMP ABORTION GAG ORDER — Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, one of the tech leaders who attended a meeting with the then president-elect last December, shared her opposition to a Reagan-era policy Trump recently reinstated that cuts off foreign aid to global health organizations that discuss or advocate abortion as a family planning option. “I started my career working at the World Bank on health care in India. I saw firsthand how clinics funded by foreign aid are often the only source of health care for women,” she writes in a Facebook post. “Comprehensive family planning helps prevent unintended pregnancies, deaths and abortions. This week’s executive order reinstating the global gag rule will make that work much harder.” Sandberg noted that she backs the Global Health, Empowerment and Rights (HER) Act, which would reverse this order. TRUMP ADMIN SHOWS SUPPORT FOR 18F AND TTS — Reed Cordish, the assistant to Trump for intragovernment and tech initiatives, had some reassuring words for employees at 18F and the Technology Transformation Service, during a town hall on Thursday. “We have your back,” he said, according to a tweet from the White House’s Chief Digital Officer Gerrit Lansing. Cordish has previously said the Trump administration would “continue and build off [the] good work,” that the Obama administration did to improve government IT, although there had been questions about whether programs like 18F would keep running under a Trump presidency. This statement along with Lansing’s recent tweet about the U.S. Digital Service seems to suggest these startups are here to stay.

A Google Maps error has turned Bangkok into a gigantic park Posted 18 hours ago by Jon Russell (@jonrussell) 0 SHARES Next Story Apple joins Amazon, Facebook, Google, IBM and Microsoft in AI initiative Here’s a fun story that I wish was true — Google Maps today decided to turn Bangkok, and a large swathe of the rest of Thailand, into the world’s largest park. Users of the Google Maps mobile apps and visitors to its website who look up the Thai capital will notice that the entire city and much of the surrounding area is covered in green. Green means grass, and grass means parks. The green is very visible That’s quite refreshing change for Bangkok, which has been named among the world’s top 100 most polluted cities, but unfortunately it wasn’t the result of some a mass-urban renovation project. Instead, it seems that Google mistakenly redrew the borders of the country’s Thung Yai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctuary, and forget to close it properly, as Khao Sod reports. The result is a pretty interesting sight, which also makes it rather difficult to locate the city’s genuine parks since it all just blends into green. We’re betting someone is on the case, and that this mishap will be taken care of soon. If you want to take a look, now’s the time. This isn’t the only incident in which one of the world’s largest internet companies has goofed up in Thailand recently. Just after Christmas, Facebook’s Safety Check service was triggered in the city as a result of a fake news story. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Google Founded 1998 Overview Google is a multinational corporation that is specialized in internet-related services and products.

Here's a look at the key numbers: Revenue rose 22% to $26.06 billion ($25.2 billion expected) Adjusted earnings of $9.36 per share ($9.67 expected) Paid clicks jumped 43% year over year Cost-per-click on Google properties fell -16% year over year Other Bets revenues climbed 74.7% to $262 million   Google’s mobile search and video ads boosted revenue in the fourth quarter, but increased spending on hardware and other new businesses, as well as a larger-than-expected tax rate, weighed on the bottom line. In addition to the hard numbers, investors had their eyes on Alphabet's "Other Bets" —  the separate companies focused on ambitious new projects from self-driving cars to biotech. Alphabet ended several projects and lost many top executives and leaders during the back half of 2016. The moves were designed to help cut costs from Other Bets, which have yet to generate any meaningful revenue for Alphabet. During the earnings call, Google CEO Sundar Pichai touched a lot on Google's main new areas of investment like hardware, cloud services, and YouTube. However, Pichai wouldn't give any hard numbers for subscribers to paid YouTube services like YouTube Red or YouTube Music, saying only it was "early days" for those products.

According to a new report, Google is again focusing on the camera on the Pixel 2 device and this year we may finally see an affordable Pixel smartphone from the company. 9to5google cites an unnamed person familiar with the matter to report that Google is also considering including the water resistance to its next Pixel smartphone. Though, the report adds that the feature is "still on the table" which indicates that the company is still considering and has not made its mind. Last year, Google confessed that the Pixel and Pixel XL were not water resistant as the company reportedly ran out of time. The report says that the Pixel is being tested with improved processors from two manufacturers and will flaunt a higher price tag than the first Google Pixel devices. The Pixel 2 is being claimed to be tested with "some Snapdragon 83X chips, others with Intel chips." The report citing sources claim that Google is testing the new Pixel phones for low-light photography. To recall, Google last year claimed that the Pixel phones sport the best smartphone camera and the company seems to be working to further improve the feature. It's worth noting that the new leak points to an early version of the alleged Pixel 2 and there might be alterations and other tweaks by the company when the devices are actually launched later this year. The report further claims that Google is also testing a custom chipset for a test device. "Multiple test devices with different chipsets are being used now," the report adds. Google Pixel phones, the first self-branded smartphones by the company, have shown consistent performance in the overall market. Morgan Stanley recently predicted that Google sold 3 million Pixel smartphones by end of 2016 and thus generating $2 billion in revenue. Last year, an analytics firm during Black Friday Sales claimed that the Google Pixel was more popular than the iPhone 7 when it came to activations over the weekend. In India, the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones have been available with great discounts through e-commerce websites.

Tech Entertainment Business Social Deals Podcast About Computers Image Source: Eric Risberg/AP/REX/Shutterstock Does Google have a voice problem? Chris Smith @chris_writes January 27th, 2017 at 7:15 AM Share Tweet Google’s parent company Alphabet on Thursday reported its financial performance for the fourth quarter of 2016, and the news wasn’t good. Alphabet missed Wall Street’s target, and the stock took a hit in after-hours trading. Google’s search business is still the main money-maker for Alphabet, dwarfing all other initiatives, including hardware. Analysts are now concerned for Google’s future, as they found a potential problem for the search giant: voice. Don't Miss: Netflix for Android just got a new feature iPhone owners will never see One of the winners of CES earlier this month was Amazon, and there’s no doubt about it. The company’s voice-based Alexa assistant will not be exclusive to Amazon hardware. Instead, Alexa will be found inside or work with a variety of products this year, including refrigerators, cars, accessories for home (other speakers, smart lamps, robots, etc.catchup), and even smartphones. Amazon’s Echo smart speaker is a massive win, one that made Amazon the de facto leader in voice-based interaction. Apple, Google, and Microsoft all have their own voice assistant, but the companies focused on mobile devices (smartphones and laptops), while Amazon took over the home. And Google is now catch up with its Google Assistant that powers just Google Home and the Google Pixel, for now. Wall Street analysts have been pressing Google CEO Sundar Pichai on Thursday on the matter. According to Business Insider, analysts asked Google whether the company is at risk from the growing popularity of voice-based devices. The problem with these devices is that they lack any sort of screen that could display ads, which presents a huge problem for Google. Advertising is the main business model for Google, and if can’t show ads it can’t make money. Pichai said that Google was “comfortable” about the future, but he didn’t explain how Google will adapt its search business model to computing experiences that don’t require screens. “We think about it from a long-term perspective,” Pichai said. “So I see more opportunity than challenge when I think about voice search.” Pichai said that ”users will have many different ways by which they interact” with computers, with voice being just one mode. Pichai told the audience that it’s “early days” for voice computing and that Google has more experience than competitors working on natural language search and speech recognition. That said, Google isn’t doomed, and it’ll surely fight fiercely in the voice-based computing age that’s about to start. But right now it’s Amazon who’s getting all the attention.

Photos Videos Topics Live SL 170/5 (19.5) - SA 169/5 (20) Live SL 85/2 (23) - SA (Yet to bat) Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Education & Careers TRENDING# Republic Day 2017 Kaabil Raees Donald Trump Bigg Boss 10 Home Money Google banned 1.7 billion 'misleading' ads in 2016, twice more than 2015 Shares136 Fri, 27 Jan 2017-09:00pm , New Delhi , PTI Google's annual 'Better Ads Report' for 2016 gives the number and reasons behind banning of ads. Internet giant Google on Friday said it took down 1.7 billion ads in 2016 that violated its advertising policies, more than double the number of "bad ads" it banned in 2015. These ads were misleading, promoted illegal products and unrealistic offers or were inappropriate, according to Google's annual 'Better Ads Report' for 2016. The most common inappropriate online ads were for illegal products. Google disabled more than 68 million bad ads for healthcare violations and 17 million bad ads for illegal gambling violations in 2016. "A free and open web is a vital resource for people and businesses around the world. And ads play a key role in ensuring you have access to accurate, quality information online. But bad ads can ruin the online experience for everyone," Google Director of Product Management Sustainable Ads Scott Spencer said. He added "bad ads" can trick people into sharing personal information and infect devices with harmful software. "Ultimately, bad ads pose a threat to users, Google's partners, and the sustainability of the open web itself," he said. Last year, Google expanded its policies to better protect users from misleading and predatory offers. In July, it introduced a policy to ban ads for payday loans, which often resulted in unaffordable payments and high default rates for users. "In the six months since launching this policy, we disabled more than 5 million payday loan ads," Google said. Google also beefed up its technology to spot and disable bad ads even faster. "For example, 'trick to click' ads often appear as system warnings to deceive users into clicking on them, not realising they are often downloading harmful software or malware. In 2016, Google detected and disabled a total of 112 million ads for 'trick to click', 6X more than in 2015," the report said. For ads developed exclusively for the mobile web, Google's systems detected and disabled over 23,000 'self-clicking ads' on its platforms this year as compared to only having to disable a few thousand of these bad ads last year. Similarly, the report highlighted a dramatic increase in scamming activity in 2016 and close to 7 million bad ads were disabled for intentionally attempting to trick the Google detection systems. Year 2016 also saw rise of a new type of scammers called 'tabloid cloakers' that take advantage of current trends and hot topics, for example a government election, a trending news story or a well-known celebrity. The ads used by these scammers may look like headlines for real articles on a news website but when clicked upon, consumers are redirected to a site selling weight loss products. In 2016, Google suspended over 1,300 accounts for tabloid cloaking. In December alone, Google took down 22 cloakers that were responsible for ads seen over 20 million times by people online in a single week. In 2016, Google took action on 47,000 sites for promoting content and products related to weight-loss scams. It also took action on more than 15,000 sites for unwanted software and disabled 900,000 ads for containing malware. Around 6,000 sites and 6,000 accounts were suspended for attempting to advertise counterfeit goods, like imitation designer watches.

The move, announced Thursday, will stop Google relying on an intermediate certificate authority (GIAG2) issued by a third party in its ongoing process of rolling out HTTPS across its products and services. "As we look forward to the evolution of both the web and our own products it is clear HTTPS will continue to be a foundational technology," Google explained in a blog post. "This is why we have made the decision to expand our current Certificate Authority efforts to include the operation of our own Root Certificate Authority." The newly established Google Trust Services will operate these Certificate Authorities on behalf of Google and parent company Alphabet. Google's techies warn that the process of embedding root certificates into products that go on to be broadly deployed will take time. To hasten the process, Google has purchased two existing root certificate authorities, GlobalSign R2 and R4. "These Root Certificates will enable us to begin independent certificate issuance sooner rather than later," according to Google. "We intend to continue the operation of our existing GIAG2 subordinate Certificate Authority. This change will enable us to begin the process of migrating to our new, independent infrastructure." As well as operating root certificates, Google has secured the option to cross-sign its CAs, in order to ease potential rollout snags. Google advises third-party developers working on code designed to connect to a Google property to include a wide set of trustworthy roots including but not limited to those offered through Google Trust Services. ® Sponsored: Achieving rapid delivery of high quality software with continuous delivery Tips and corrections 18 Comments More from The Register Mozilla plots TLS 1.3 future for Firefox Quicker handshake starts encrypting data sooner 7 Comments Edgier Edge pledge: TLS fledge no speed wedge, Redmond man said Faster, stronger crypto comes to baked-in browser 4 Comments Unmasking malware in TLS connections?

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India US World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Budget 2017 Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones Google Pixel 2 rumours: Improved camera, CPU and an affordable Pixel in the making New information on Pixel 2 reveals a lot more than we already know, and it's kind of exciting. Sami Khan   January 27, 2017 20:40 IST Google PixelScreenshot from Google Play Store Google is already working on the successors for its Pixel series and a lot is going into play to make them supreme. In a battle against players like Apple and Samsung, Google needs to have a solid performer combined with great looks. A hint of that was actually seen in Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones, but there's more to deploy. According to a report by 9to5google, Google is improving its next Pixel smartphone with significant changes. The focus continues to be the camera, which is said to be improved exponentially on the low-light photography front. Don't forget Google had claimed that the Pixel phones have the best smartphone camera. The report suggests the Pixel 2 will not be large on the megapixel size, but the company will compensate with extra features. The Pixel series sports 12.3MP dual-pixel camera for the rear and an 8MP front snapper with series of features to deliver optimum results. The Pixel 2 is expected to outperform the Pixel, but it remains to be seen to what extent. Waterproofing is in the books, no excuses! Another important addition to the Pixel 2 is going to be the waterproofing, which was largely left out from the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones due to shortage of time. At least, that's not going to be an excuse this year. Qualcomm or Intel chips? According to 9to5google's source, Google is testing multiple Pixel 2 models with improved chipsets. The company is said to be working with Qualcomm and Intel on this one. Sadly, MediaTek is no longer a part of Google's collaboration for Pixel 2, the report adds. Is there going to be a Snapdragon 83X processor or Intel Kaby Lake powering the upcoming Pixel 2 this year? It's too early to predict and a lot could change by the time the product launches. Let's keep our options wide open for now. Improvements come with a price Don't get too excited about the significant improvements Pixel 2's camera, design and performance just yet. With all this happening, Google is expected to bring a higher price tag. It is not clear how much exactly the Pixel 2 is going to cost and quite frankly it is too soon to predict. But the report says that the new Pixels will cost higher than the first Pixels. If the report is to be believed, the Pixel 2 is going to cost at least $50 higher than the Pixel, which was launched at $649 for the entry-level variant and $749 for the 128GB model. You can do the math. Disappointed? Here's something more... You can either start saving or settle for a toned-down version of Pixel 2. According to the report, Google is also testing a few prototypes of a device dubbed as Pixel 2B, which is said to launch shortly after Pixel 2. The Pixel 2B is expected to have a less powerful hardware and be priced significantly lower than the Pixel 2.

The Internet and incredibly fast-growing social media have become a medium over which lies can often be replicated millions of times within a matter of seconds with a single keystroke, reaching every corner of the world. A highly beneficial instrument when used for peace, friendship and good, social media turns into a dangerous weapon in the hands of those who seek to spread evil. Every day, we are repeatedly bombarded with uncontrolled, unsupervised, anonymous, unsigned, provocative and manipulative information. Today, social media is used by about two billion people worldwide. With the rapid rise of smart phones, this number is expected to reach three billion by 2020. With 1.7 billion active members, Facebook reaches 20 per cent of the global population, YouTube has one billion, Google+ has 550 million, Instagram and Linkedin have some 400 million users each, Twitter has 350 million, and Snapchat and Pinterest have 100 million members. Vkontakte, essentially Russian Facebook, has reached 400 million members in 10 years, while China’s version of Facebook, QZone, has reached one billion in the same period. These social media platforms also brought with them instant messaging applications. People have begun to use WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger or Wechat instead of cell phones. WhatsApp, Wechat and Facebook Messenger were the first ones to exceed the 1-billion-member number. As of last year, QQ has 900 million users. Sixty billion messages are sent per day via WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. People have never been in such constant communication with each other in any period of history as they are in the 21st century, which can also be named as the age of communication. Today, protest movements such as Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter are organised over social media. Facebook provided great logistical support during the Arab Spring and European street protests. Social media and the age of communication have also given rise to the 21st century generation. Rather than being used to spread goodness and love, social media, which revolutionised communication between people, has become in many countries a medium where the loudest, the most sensational, the most sarcastic or the most insulting speaker often comes to the fore. It has turned into a place where conceited, egocentric and narcissistic personalities rise to fame. Some users care about not what is being told, but rather how it is being told: It is this aspect of the social media that makes it a massive propaganda channel Goebbels and Hitler could not even imagine in the wrong hands. Eighty million of the 1.7 billion Facebook accounts are believed to be fake and the number of bot accounts on Twitter is estimated to be around 23 million. Users have to be selective and distinguish the genuine tweets among the 500 million written, or the 350 million photographs and 100 million hours of videos uploaded on Facebook. But, most consider this a drudgery and accept the information they encounter most frequently as true and accurate. However, a quick investigation easily reveals that most of this information does not hold any truth. And, when provocative inducements on social media are combined with the more generalised indoctrination of the mainstream media, a much darker picture emerges. For this, a lie is first told on the social media. Then, the top-selling newspapers of the country announce the lie to the whole country with headlines such as “this claim has taken social media by storm.” Something similar to the inducements of social media also occurs in search engines. Google has virtually become the sole source of information. As of 2014, Google archives have been indexed to 30 trillion pages. These archives see 100 billion searches per month and 40,000 per second. All of these searches are carried out via algorithms based on the codes written by Google. This means that 1.2 billion people who have made searches to date can only reach Google-selected answers. In other words, people think they reach unbiased and accurate information whereas they actually reach the information Google wants and allows them to. The new president of the United States, Donald Trump, repeatedly pointed out during the election campaign that the search results on Google were being manipulated in favour of his rival, Hillary Clinton. Google founder Larry Page publicly supporting Clinton and the involvement of the Google CEO Eric Schmidt’s technology company in the Clinton campaign, also reinforced these claims. A video posted on Sourcefed in June revealed how Google was working in favour of Clinton and against Trump via its auto-completion alternatives. Similar claims were also raised for the “trending stories” section of Facebook. The Trump campaign brought to light the fact that Facebook had been boosting the topics that benefit Clinton. The way to neutralise the devastating effects of social media and the Internet is through learning and understanding how to appraise information through reason, sense and conscience. Those who cannot see the truth among the thousands of lies will be prone to provocations and this will only serve the interests of those who stand much to gain from turmoil. The most vital power of good people against the lies conceived and spread by the purveyors of evil will be their conscience and their resolve to strive for the good cause. The conscience of those adamant for love, friendship, peace and honesty will both form a barrier against the proponents of chaos and turn social media into a medium of unmitigated good. Only through wisdom, education and awareness can we eliminate this negative effect of social media that polarises us and alienates us from each other, thus leading the way to the emergence of a generation that gets along amiably.

It really acted as an olive branch from Google to the webmaster community and, in my opinion, was a huge success. This year, it is coming back on March 22, 2017 and you need to have an SMX West ticket to go. SMX wrote "attendance is limited to the first 500 SMX West three-day All Access conference pass holders. Sorry, one-day All Access, workshop, bootcamp only or EXPO+ pass holders are not eligible to attend the 2017 Google Dance." What is different this year? Well, Gary Illyes promised that John Mueller will be there this year and even more, he will be dancing! Wanna watch @johnmu dance salsa? If yes, come to the Google Dance on 22nd of March!https://t.co/CMRARvc12N pic.twitter.com/S141j41X0T— Gary Illyes ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ (@methode) January 23, 2017 Very exciting and I can't wait!

In short, when an ad is disapproved, it doesn't show why, normally it does tell the advertiser why. Here is a typical ad disapproval bubble that shows why the ad was disapproved: Again, some advertisers are not seeing anything but a disapproval notice but with no reason on why the ad was disapproved. Cassie from Google said in the thread, "I've just confirmed that some other advertisers are experiencing this as well." "The engineering team is currently working on a fix," she added. She recommends the advertiser calls AdWords support to get help on why the ad was disapproved until this bug is fixed. Forum discussion at Google AdWords Help.

Source: Shutterstock For the quarter ending in December, the company formerly known as Google earned $9.36 per share versus expectations of $9.63. Alphabet’s top line of $26.06 billion compares favorably to analyst predictions for revenue of $25.22 billion. The company reported a profit of $8.67 per share of GOOGL stock in the same quarter from a year earlier, when it drove sales of $21.33 billion. The numbers interrupt a long-term streak of forward, even if not perfect, fiscal progress. Alphabet has topped estimates in five of the past seven quarters. CFO Ruth Porat commented on the Alphabet earnings report: “Our growth in the fourth quarter was exceptional — with revenues up 22% year on year and 24% on a constant currency basis. This performance was led by mobile search and YouTube. We’re seeing great momentum in Google’s newer investment areas and ongoing strong progress in Other Bets.” GOOGL shares were 2.1% lower in after-hours trading. New Focus on Hardware Going Well Alphabet, while it was still called Google, was founded primarily as a web search engine, and that’s still the lion’s share of its revenue mix. Though aggregate cost-per-click fell, continuing a long (and industry-wide) trend of deterioration, with another 9% year-over-year decline, that dip continues to be more than offset by a sheer increase of volume. Aggregate paid clicks grew 20% on a year-over-year basis. Google — the search engine and its ancillary products and services — contributed $25.8 billion worth of last quarter’s revenue, and was responsible for $7.88 billion of the $8.5 billion in Alphabet’s operating income. Although search and ads are still its bread-and-butter business, the company has recently begun the development of hardware and Internet of Things devices. The highest-profile of these new initiatives is the so-called Pixel phone. Although the company had brought smartphones to the market in the past — like the Nexus — those were mostly third-party/branded handsets. The Pixel is a true, home-grown, in-house smartphone from Google that’s designed to take aim at the popular iPhone line from Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Bloomberg recently reported that Alphabet sold an estimated 1 million Pixels last quarter; the company doesn’t provide such details. That doesn’t even come close to the 45.5 million iPhones Apple sold last quarter, but it’s a very good first effort. The Pixel is just one way Alphabet has remained relevant as consumers continue to migrate from desktops to mobile devices. Its Android operating system is now the OS of choice on nearly 90% of all handheld devices sold, funneling users to Google’s apps, services and revenue-bearing display ads.

Pre-Amazon Product (Investor's Business Daily) Related GOOG Alphabet's Q4 Fails To Excite, But Long-Term View Remains Largely Unchanged Here's What Alibaba's Recent Acquisitions Suggest About The Future Of The Economy How To Fight Killer Robots (Seeking Alpha) “We come away from 4Q results upbeat on solid two-year growth trends in Google Sites revenue ex-FX,” Deutsche Bank’s Lloyd Walmsley said in a note, while maintaining a Buy rating on Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and raising the price target from $1,090 to $1,100. EBITDA Margins EBITDA margins for core Google were better than expected, despite robust revenue growth for the Licensing & Other (L&O) segment, driven by Pixel. Walmsley estimated that, ex-Pixel and including one-time Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) in the latter half of 2016 for core Google, the core Google EBITDA margins actually rose 59 bps year-on-year. “As this settles in, we expect shares to rebound from the post-close lows,” the analyst stated. Revenue Alphabet reported total net revenue of $20.95 billion for Q4, marginally ahead of the estimate, with slight year-on-year margin compression, despite the sharp ramp in Pixel phones. Revenue for the L&O segment came in at $3,403 million, in line with the estimate but well above the consensus forecast, implying Pixel units of 1.5 million. YouTube remained strong during the quarter, with Alphabet stating that revenue grew at a “significant rate.” In addition, Verily received an investment of $800 million from a Singapore-based fund, reflecting continued capital discipline. “The company has yet to launch its $7 billion repurchase activity, suggesting a large corporate action may have been in the works,” the analyst stated.

However, earnings were up 7.1% year over year. Following weaker-than-expected earnings, shares were down more than 2% in after-hours trading. Higher cost of revenue and steeper taxes impacted the quarter’s earnings. Coming to the price performance, over the past one year, shares of Alphabet have been steadily treading higher. The stock returned 19.43% compared with the Zacks categorized Internet Services industry’s gain of 19.39%. View photos On the Other Bets side, most of the businesses included in it are in their early stages. However, it is gradually picking up. Management said that Nest, Fiber and Verily were revenue contributors in the fourth quarter. The main drivers of the Google business haven’t changed. Pricing remains under pressure both on account of the ongoing FX concerns as well as continued strength in mobile and TrueView. Volumes are however encouraging as total paid click growth of 36% remains a reassuring number. Google continues to enjoy strength on the mobile platform. One of the drivers is Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP). This is being accepted by many publishers and sites around the world covering more than 700,000 domains. Management is focused on driving mobile experiences and the company is well positioned to pick up strong intent-to-buy signals as a result of studying mobile searches from its huge data base. As a result, direct response marketers remain interested in it. Google also mentioned messaging as an important addition to its product line in the form of Allo (mobile messaging) and Duo (video messaging) to further drive user experience. Also, the company said that Google Cloud is generating substantial revenue growth, reflecting the ongoing momentum in the business.  The company has greater control on the browser through Android as well as distribution agreements with Apple (AAPL). But the upcoming threats shouldn’t be ignored. Apple may not renew its agreement, Microsoft MSFT Windows 10 could steal overall search market share, Facebook FB graph search and the social network itself could take away advertising dollars, and Amazon AMZN already takes care of most product searches. Management said that YouTube remains a strong contributor benefiting from the increase in online video consumption. More than a thousand creators are currently engaged with the platform, bringing in a thousand subscribers everyday. And finally, Google platforms like Android, Chrome and Daydream continue to help it draw more users and sell more ads. The Numbers in Detail Revenues Gross total revenue of $26.06 billion grew 16.1% sequentially and 22.2% year over year (up 24% in constant currency or CC). The increase was primarily driven by the strength in Mobile Search, with the ongoing strength in YouTube. Also, strength in newer investment areas and solid progress in Other Bets aided revenue growth. The geographic distribution was as follows: the U.S. generated around 49% of revenues, up 19.8% sequentially. The U.K., with an 8% revenue share was up 10.5% sequentially. Other international markets accounted for the balance, representing sequential increase of 14.1%. Google Segment The segment includes search, advertising, Play, hardware and Cloud & Apps. Read More Coming to the search business, on a sequential basis, revenues from Google-owned sites grew 11.7%, while that from partner sites increased 18.7% resulting in a total advertising revenue growth of 13.0%.Google-owned sitesand partner sites grew 20.3% and 7.0%, respectively, year over year and brought in 69% and 17% of quarterly revenues. Management said that mobile search continued to benefit from improvements in ad formats and delivery initiated in the third quarter of 2015 as well as remained optimistic about search revenue growth on both tablets and desktops. TrueView and DoubleClick Bid Manager were the primary drivers of YouTube revenue although app promotions are becoming bigger contributors. The traditional AdSense benefited from strength in programmatic and AdMob, offset by a decline in the traditional network business. Other revenue was up 39.9% sequentially and 62.0% year over year to just over 13% of fourth quarter revenue. The strength was on account of Play Store sales (apps, content) and cloud revenues. Other Bets Segment Alphabet broke out the segment for the first time in the March quarter of2016. The segment includes Fiber, Verily, Calico, Nest and incubation activities in X Labs. Revenues were up 33.0% sequentially and 74.7% year over year. Since this segment is a combination of several businesses that are in the pre-revenue stage, operating different models and serving diverse end markets, the results are likely to be lumpy in any given quarter.  Total traffic acquisition cost, or TAC (the portion of revenue shared with Google’s partners and amounts paid to distribution partners and others who direct traffic to the Google website) was up 15.9% sequentially and 19.6% year over year. TAC paid out to network partners were up 17.5% sequentially and 7.6% year over year. Mobile search carries higher TAC so the increase in mobile search revenue is driving related TAC according to management. TAC for distribution arrangements was up 13.3% sequentially and 48.3% year over year. Net advertising revenue, excluding TAC was up 12.2% sequentially and 16.8% year over year. Revenue net of TAC came in at $21.22 billion, up 16.1% sequentially and 22.8% year over year. The top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.58 billion. Margins Gross margin of 59.1% shrank 216 bps sequentially and 251 bps from the year-ago quarter. Price declines remained negative in both sequential and year-over-year comparisons as the mix continued to move toward lower-margin business. Cost per click (CPC) was down a respective 9% and 15% from the previous and year-ago quarters. On a sequential basis, CPC was down 11% on Google sites but remained flat on network sites. On Google sites, CPCs were down 16% from the year-ago quarter, while network CPC declined 19%. Paid clicks grew 20% sequentially and 36% year over year, helped in part by growing volumes of mobile and TrueView ads on YouTube. Google sites did better than Network sites with paid clicks growing 23% and 43%, respectively, from the previous and year-ago quarters. Network paid clicks also increased 6% sequentially and 7% from the year-ago quarter. Operating expenses of $8.76 billion increased 9.8% sequentially and 12.9% from the December quarter of 2015. The operating margin was 25.5%, down 22 bps sequentially but up 425 bps from the year-ago quarter. Non-operating gains were $218 million compared with $278 million in the previous quarter and ($180) million in the Dec 2015 quarter. Alphabet reported net income of $5.33 billion, or 20.5% of sales, compared with $5.06 billion, or 22.5% of sales in the Sep 2016 quarter and $4.92 billion, or 23.1% of sales in the year-ago quarter. GAAP earnings of $7.56 a share were up from $7.25 in the previous quarter and $7.06 in the year-ago quarter. Balance Sheet Alphabet has a solid balance sheet, with cash and short-term investments of around $86.33 billion, up $3.27 billion from the third quarter. The company generated around $9.41 billion of cash from operations in the fourth quarter and spent $3.08 billion on capex, netting a free cash flow of $6.34 billion. Alphabet also spent $662 million on acquisitions and $13 million to repay some debt. Alphabet Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise   View photos Alphabet Inc.

View all partners Republish this article Republish our articles for free, online or in print, under Creative Commons licence. Facebook access with Yubico Security Key. Yubico Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn In an attempt to increase the security of online accounts, Facebook has added support for 2 factor authentication using USB security keys. The security keys supported are ones that support a standard called U2F which stands for Universal 2nd Factor authentication. Logging into Facebook still involves using a username and password but the 2nd factor of the process is simply a matter of inserting the key into the computer and touching a metallic part of the key. The process is faster than using an SMS text message or special authenticator app and it is potentially more secure. U2F was designed to provide a physical device that wasn’t susceptible to hackers using “man in the middle attacks”. Theoretically, a hacker could reproduce the login page of a bank or a service like Google and get the user to put their username and password in. Even when a text message is sent to the phone or an application like Google Authenticator is used, the fake login screen can simply capture that information from the user and pass it on to log in. With U2F, the exchange of information that is provided by the secure key is able to prevent this type of attack and even alert the user to the fact that the login screen was fake. Using SMS text messages to receive a second key also suffers from the problem that hackers can use a variety of means to intercept text messages. Hackers have been able to socially engineer telecommunications providers and get replacement SIM cards sent to them to hijack a person’s phone. It is also possible to get text messages re-routed to another number using a weakness in mobile wireless communication protocols. Hackers can also use fake mobile phone towers to intercept the text messages. There are a number of issues with security keys however. They cost between US$18 and US$50 and they currently only work with modern versions of the Chrome and Opera browsers on computers and Android phones that support NFC. The other problem is that at present, you can only use a security key using U2F to log into Google, Facebook, GitHub, Salesforce and Dropbox. There is no sign that Apple is planning to add support for U2F in its Safari browser or as a second factor in authorising iCloud logins. Currently, 2 factor authentication for iCloud logins involves a second Apple device providing a code. This suffers the same vulnerability to man in the middle attacks shown by using an SMS or other authenticator application. When Touch ID can be used, like on the new MacBook Pro laptop or even on Apple mobile devices, it is not used as a second factor but as a convenient way to access the main password. Two factor authentication using SMS messages, or better still, applications like Google Authenticator, is still far more secure than using a simple username and password. Using a secure key makes the process faster and more convenient and increases the level of security. For this reason, it is good news that Facebook has added support for U2F and it would be hugely beneficial if more sites and companies like Apple were to support this form of security. Having personally used a Yubico U2F USB-C key with a MacBook for the past few weeks, the experience has been far more positive than using the Google App which was slower and more cumbersome than the simple operation of sticking the USB key in and touching it to authenticate. I keep the key with my other physical keys and so it is always at hand and harder to lose. If the key is not available, it is still possible to revert to using SMS or a secondary form of authentication for most applications.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google Maps adds parking difficulty icon for 25 metro areas in the US By Rei Padla - January 27, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter The tech gods have somehow answered every driver’s prayer for a way to make driving and parking easier with apps like FordPass, Waze, and Inrix. Just recently, the New York City government launched the ParkNYC app that lets drivers pay for street parking with their phones. These are just some programs that offer convenience to drivers. We also know Google has numerous tools that every driver, commuter, and pedestrian often use. One of which is the Google Maps app that can be integrated with a lot of similar apps. This time, Google Maps for Android is getting a new feature that shows parking difficulty so drivers can factor in the time looking for a parking slot in a certain destination. Google usually tells you the best route but parking is altogether a different challenge. To makes things better, Google has enabled the feature initially for 25 metro areas in the United States. You will see that parking difficult icon so you can anticipate what to do or what will happen. The new parking difficulty icon will be shown in the directions card. The difficulties usually rate from limited to medium to easy. Google will base them on the previous and historical parking data available.

 Mobile and YouTube drive Alphabet's 4Q growth BI Intelligence Jan. 27, 2017, 9:47 AM 4,315 facebook linkedin twitter email print BI Intelligence See Also YouTube gets social with in-app messaging Millennials skip YouTube ads... and that's ok YouTube monetizes live streams with Super Chat This story was delivered to BI Intelligence "Digital Media Briefing" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. Google’s parent company Alphabet reported $26.1 billion in total revenue, up 22% year over year (YoY) and 3% above consensus estimate of $25.2 billion. For the sixth straight quarter, mobile search was the main driver of growth for the company, reflecting Google’s dominance in advertising. Alphabet’s revenue is broken into two primary segments: Google Inc., and Other Bets. Here's how they did: Google Inc., the company’s core business, had $25.8 billion in revenue, up 22% YoY. This includes revenue from advertising, Android, Chrome, Maps, YouTube, Google Play, Google Cloud, and Google’s portfolio of hardware products. Other Bets, which includes Nest, Verily, and Fiber, posted revenue of $262 million, compared with $150 million a year earlier, a 75% increase. Mobile search and YouTube were the main drivers of Google’s strong performance, according to Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat. YouTube revenue is growing at a significant rate driven by video advertising, and the company is also seeing decent growth in desktop and tablet advertising. Strong performance in programmatic and at AdMob also drove revenue growth at Google’s third-party network sites.   Core Google “other revenues” spiked in Q4. Other revenue (not to be confused with “other bets” revenue) includes revenue from Google Play, Google Cloud and hardware. The 62% YoY growth rate in Q4 2016 was a sharp acceleration from Q3’s 39% YoY growth, which the company attributed to strong growth across the board in Play, Cloud and hardware. As a reminder, Q4 is the first quarter that includes sales of Pixel phones and Google Home, which likely contributed to the strength.     Google ads are also becoming more cost efficient. Cost-per-click, or the amount that Google charges for its ads, was down 15% YoY and down 9% quarter on quarter (QoQ), while paid clicks, which is the amount of times people click those ads, were up 36% YoY and 20% QoQ. This latter figure drives the bulk of Google’s revenue. Consumers continue to increase their time spent consuming digital media, while advertisers continue to increase their ad budgets into digital channels. The influx is not expected to let up in the near future. The US digital advertising industry will continue to experience remarkable growth through 2021 to reach nearly $100 billion in annual revenue, driven primarily by the sustained migration of ad dollars from traditional TV to digital video and the continued increase of social spending.  Overall, the strong growth of the US digital ad market can largely be attributed to increased time spent by consumers on digital media and brands' increased comfort with allocating budgets to digital formats, particularly on digital video. In a recent 2016 survey of almost 400 US ad agencies and marketers, the IAB found that two-thirds of respondents plan on increasing spending on digital video in the next year.  Moreover, mobile will become the top destination for digital ad spending as advertisers continue to attempt to resolve the disconnect between the rapid growth in time spent on phones and tablets and the relatively small share of ad budgets that are allocated to such platforms — known as the mobile opportunity gap. In fact, mobile is set to eclipse desktop ad spend by 2018. Dylan Mortensen, senior research analyst for BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on U.S. digital media ad revenue that forecasts revenue trends over the next five years and outlines the key growth drivers for overall digital ad revenue in the U.S. Here are some key points from the report: US digital ad revenue is expected to reach nearly $100 billion by 2021, according to BI Intelligence estimates. This represents compound annual growth of 8% from the $68.9 billion expected in 2016.  Mobile is positioned to become the top destination for digital ad spending as advertisers continue to attempt to close the "mobile opportunity gap." Digital video advertising will grow faster than any other segment over the next five years, as consumers shift time spent online to phones and tablets. Revenue in this category is forecast to rise from $8.5 billion in 2016 to $23 billion in 2021. Social advertising in all formats is gaining traction and will be among the key drivers of digital ad growth in the next five years. Social ad revenue is poised to climb to $30.8 billion by 2021, up from $15.5 billion this year. Artificial intelligence, augmented and virtual reality, and sponsored content will help propel further digital ad growth in the next decade.

Google is making Chromebooks even more useful for schools Posted Jan 24, 2017 by Frederic Lardinois (@fredericl) 0 SHARES Next Story Amazon nabs the first best picture Oscar nomination for a streaming service Google made a number of major announcements about its Chromebook program at the Bett education technology conference in London today. Besides disclosing that there are now over 20 million teachers and students that use Chromebooks at least weekly — and that there are now over 70 million G Suite for education users — the company also demoed two new convertible Chromebooks with stylus support, USB-C charging and world-facing cameras, the Asus Chromebook C213 and Acer Chromebook Spin 11. In addition, Google today announced that it will soon give admins full control over the Android apps that run on the Chromebooks they give to students and that Adobe is launching a new suite of its creative apps for Android that are now optimized for Chromebooks. The trend here is obvious: Chromebooks and the G Suite for Education are obviously a massive success for Google, and the company is working with its hardware partners to make them even more attractive for schools. Google’s director of product management for Android and Chrome for Education and Enterprise Rajen Sheth noted during a press event ahead of today’s announcement that the company paid attention to the feedback it was getting from teachers. The one request it continuously received was that teachers were looking for a single, sturdy device that combined the advantages of tablets and a laptop with a full keyboard. Until the arrival of Android apps on Chrome OS, Chromebooks with touch screens mostly felt like a luxury, given that Chrome OS itself was never optimized for touch. Now, touch on Chrome OS makes sense, especially when you have a hybrid device like the Asus Flip or the upcoming new devices from Asus and Acer. Stylus support for Chromebooks isn’t really new. The Samsung Chromebook Pro, for example, will also support pen input. As Sheth noted, Google worked with Acer and Asus to allow them to build far cheaper — yet still pressure-sensitive — styli (students, after all, will likely lose one or two a semester) by building a lot of the tech into the screen instead of the pen itself (using Wacom’s electro-magnetic resonance technology). Just like with their more expensive brethren (or a cheap No. 2 pencil), students will also be able to use the other end of the pen as an eraser. One feature of the new devices Sheth specifically stressed is their world-facing camera. Once you flip the keyboard on a traditional convertible back to use it as a laptop, all you get is a user-facing camera, after all. That makes it hard to use the camera as a microscope in a science class, for example. These new laptops, however, now feature a second camera that sits at the top of the keyboard. That’s a pretty straightforward solution that opens up a whole range of new use cases for these Chromebooks in schools. As far as specs go, neither one of the new laptops will break any records. The Acer Chromebook Spin 11 will come with either an dual- or quad-core Intel Celeron processor with either 4GB or 8GB or RAM and 32GB or 64GB of on-board eMMC flash storage. The Spin 11, which charges over USB-C and should get about 10 hours of battery life, was also built to withstand spills and drops from up to 48 inches. The Asus Chromebook Flip 213, too, is meant to handle the quite a bit of abuse and should get about 11 hours of battery life. Asus did not provide any additional details about the C213’s specs, though, except that it features a modular design that should make replacing parts easy, two HD cameras, and that it’s screen is covered by Gorilla Glass 4. Neither Asus nor Acer announced pricing for their new Chromebooks, though Google notes that they will be priced to be affordable by schools. They’ll be available in late spring. As for Adobe’s app support for Chrome OS, the details are sadly sparse, too. Adobe, after all, offers its users apps like Photoshop Mix and Lightroom Mobile for Android; those apps already happily work on Chrome OS devices that support Android apps today. Adobe says that the updated Creative Cloud apps will “capitalize on Chromebook’s strengths – speed, simplicity and security.” We expect to hear a bit more about what this actually means in the coming weeks. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Google Founded 1998 Overview Google is a multinational corporation that is specialized in internet-related services and products.

The rumoured Pixel 2 smartphone from Google is said to sport a better camera than its predecessor and the company is already testing out the devices with chipsets provided by two different manufacturers to ace the low-light photography card. However, the camera on board the successor will “not have large MP size,” but it will “compensate in extra features.” Pixel 2 might also come with waterproofing capabilities as the source has made a slight remark about the feature being “still on the table”. Google is also testing some early prototype of the Pixel 2 smartphone with Snapdragon 83X and Intel chipsets. It is also said that Google did “develop a custom chipset for a test device.” The source also says that there will at least be a $50 increase in the price of the flagship Pixel 2. Furthermore, the source indicates that apart from the Pixel 2 smartphone, Google might also bring in a budget, Pixel 2B. Google surely wants to tap into the budget segment customers in emerging markets and thus the Pixel 2B will feature a less powerful hardware but will also come with a Made by Google tag. The source reiterates that the Pixel 2B will be “aimed at different markets.” No details about this device have been released as of now except for the source claiming that it “will be significantly cheaper” than its elder sibling. We’re just starting to get bits and pieces of information about devices which aren’t that old and considering the aforementioned source have just been corroborated by just a single source, many of the things he/she mentions might just change in the time between Google’s official announcement.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Internet Google Chrome now reloads pages 28% faster than before Internet Google Chrome now reloads pages 28% faster than before By Bertila Helena - Jan 27, 2017 Chrome may soon become a lot faster for everyone thanks to some big changes Google has implemented in the latest version of its popular browser. The company claims it’ll now reload pages 28% quicker than before. Reloads are usually a time-guzzling process in which a browser like Google Chrome check with web servers if cached resources are usable in a system called validation. The entire thing requires hundreds of network requests per page to a number of domains. Handsets often get hit the hardest with this behavior, resulting in grave performance issues. People typically reload pages because it’s broken or they want to check if there’s new content. According to Google, current refresh systems usually resolve the former and inefficiently address the latter, especially for phones. The reload mechanism was originally designed to fix broken pages, a common occurrence, so it seemed reasonable to solve both use cases at the same time. Google now feels that this concern has become less relevant now that the quality of websites has improved. Also See: Google rolls out Instant Tethering mobile hotspot feature Keeping that in mind, Google has revamped Chrome specifically for the second stale content use case. The browser now boasts of simpler reload conduct which only validates the main resource and continues with the regular page load. The brand claims that this behavior maximizes the reuse of cached resources and results in lower data usage, power consumption, and latency. All-in-all, Chrome is now supposed to be 28% faster and will send out 60% less validation requests. This claim even has Facebook’s stamp of approval, with the social media giant asserting that these stats hold true for its website. It had previously told Google that the browser sent out 3 times as many validation requests compared to others.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Software Gmail to block JavaScript file attachments from February 13 Software Gmail to block JavaScript file attachments from February 13 By Sohil Nikam - Jan 27, 2017 Gmail is going to stop people from sending JavaScript (.js) attachments in emails starting from February 13 this year. The move has come about because of security concerns regarding the safety of the files. Google already blocks attachments like Windows executables (.exe), batch files (.bat), and Microsoft Saved Console files (.msc) from being sent via Gmail. Now JavaScript files will join this list. Post February 13, attempting to send a .js file will trigger a warning stating that some file types are blocked because they may spread viruses. Senders are set to get a bounce message explaining why the email was blocked for inbound mail. Google is advising people who want to send non-malicious .js files to utilize storage solutions like Google Drive or Google Cloud Storage to do so. Also Read: Google Chrome now reloads pages 28% faster than before JavaScript attachments are especially hazardous since they run directly inside Windows Script Host automatically. Google notably hasn’t said anything about what will happen if a consumer receives an email containing such a file. Gmail already has a number of safeguards in place to protect the safety of users. A visual indicator tool showcases a question mark sign if an individual receives a message from someone who can’t be authenticated by either Sender Policy Framework (SPF) or DKIM. It’s meant to act as protection against spam. Another tool focuses on warning Gmail patrons about unsafe links in an email. URLs to known malware or phishing sites instantly prompt up an alert warning them away from the page.

Name: Subject: Message: Problems with Google Play Music and how to fix them How Toby Ankit Banerjee19 hours ago 14 319 13 Google Play Music is a streaming app and music player that features over 35 million songs, which is impressive compared to a lot of other music streaming apps out there. A paid monthly subscription not only gets you complete access to the entire portfolio, but you can also take advantage of a YouTube Red membership along with it. Of course, if you aren’t looking for a streaming service, the Play Music app is a solid music player as well, for you to enjoy any music that you have stored on your device. If you are looking for a music player and streaming service combo, the Google Play Music app is a great choice. Best music streaming apps Best music players However, as is often the case with a lot of apps that are available, Google Play Music is not without its issues. To help you out, we’ve rounded up some of the common problems faced by Play Music users, and offer potential solutions and workarounds to address them. Disclaimer: Not every user will come across these issues, particularly if you make sure to keep the app updated regularly. Problem #1 – Duplicate tracks A lot of users have come across duplicate tracks that have been saved to their Google Play Music, particularly when they have synced their music from iTunes. Potential solutions: Unfortunately, the Play Music app doesn’t have a way to identify and delete duplicate tracks, so the only workaround is delete the entire collection and re-upload it. Make sure that doubles aren’t already present in the library, and then re-upload it. There is a workaround available that was created by a Reddit user, and you can find the step-by-step guide here. Keep in mind that technical know-how is definitely recommended if you are planing to follow this route. Problem #2 – Payment issues You may have come across error messages stating that the payment has been declined, cannot be processed, or that the card is “not eligible,” either when setting up the subscription for the first time and when renewing it. Potential solutions: You can try standard steps like removing and re-adding the payment method of Google Payments, make sure the card information is correct, or try another payment method. If you are card is getting declined in the Play Store but working everywhere else, you may need to contact your bank or Google to find out what the issue is. For a lot of users, restarting the app and Play Store seems to have worked. First go to Applications (or Apps or Application Manager, depending on the device) in the Settings menu and scroll down to Google Play Store. Then tap on “Force Stop.” Then tap on “Storage” and tap on “Clear Cache” and then “Clear Data.” On some devices, you may find the latter in the “Storage and USB” section the Settings menu. Open the Google Play Store after these steps and try the payment again. Problem #3 – Tracks missing on phone but available on web player Some users have found that tracks that have been downloaded on the web player don’t show up on their smartphones. Potential solutions: There is a simple workaround to fix this. In the Settings menu, go to Apps or Application Manager, search for Google Play Music. Then tap on “Storage” and then press “Clear Cache.” On some devices, you may find this under the “Storage and USB” section in the Settings menu. Restart the device, then open the Play Music app and all your music should now be available. Problem #4 – Songs not uploading You may have come across some issues with uploading songs to the Music Manager from your own collection. Potential solutions: First, make sure that the audio you are trying to upload is of a supported format. Supported formats include MP3, AAC (.m4a), WMA, FLAC, OGG, ALAC (.m4a), and DRM protected AAC (.m4p). Some music file types like WAV are not supported. If songs aren’t uploading, make sure that the library isn’t full. Currently, you can upload up to 50,000 songs to your library. If you have gone past that, your only option will be to delete some other tracks to make room for new ones.

Less Pixel for less money News of a cheaper Pixel has piqued our interest though, as Google has a history of more affordable devices from its now-defunct Nexus range.  The source claims that a lower-powered Pixel with lesser specs and a small price tag is currently being tested, so fingers crossed it’ll arrive later this year. This is the same source which claimed that the second generation Pixels will sport waterproof bodies – rather than the splashproof protection on the current handsets – and thus should be taken with a pinch of salt. They have provided correct Google information in the past though. The story so far: Google Pixel 2 ABOUT THE AUTHOR John McCann Phones, Tablets and Wearables UK Editor John (Twitter, Google+) got his first phone aged 12 and since then he's been fixated on all things mobile, churning his way through a multitude of handsets, tablets and wearables.

It may cost at least $50 (roughly Rs 3405.75) more, according to the report . The current-generation Pixel, just so you know, starts at Rs 57,000. But, there may be a significantly cheaper Pixel - aka the Pixel 2B - also in the works for the budget conscious. The Pixel 2B will quite obviously, be low on specs but will carry the 'Made by Google' tag for those looking to try out the Mountain View company's tryst with hardware. The high-end Pixel 2 is said to focus on improvements in almost all the quarters, even more so in the camera department. The current-generation Pixel has already garnered rave reviews for its camera, and with the Pixel 2, Google may be looking to up its low-light photography game even further. This camera will "not have large MP size, but will rather compensate in extra features," the report cites a reliable source as saying. The same source also adds that waterproofing is still on the table. Google is reportedly testing "multiple test devices with different chipsets," with Qualcomm and Intel in the fore-front, according to the report. Little is known about the budget Pixel 2B, except that it may be directed towards emerging markets. The phone may be an answer to Nexus fan-boys who've been looking for an affordable Pixel and have been forced to look elsewhere, most prominently the OnePlus 3T. The Pixel and the Pixel XL are Google's first official entry into the mainstream hardware space. They have been built - from ground up - to take on Apple's iPhone. Just like the new iPhone, Google's first Pixel phone crams in the very latest in hardware and software. It is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor clubbed with 4 gigs of RAM. It is available in 32GB and 128GB storage options. Just like the new iPhone, the Pixel does not have a microSD card slot. The new Pixel phones sport a 12.3-megapixel camera with f/2.0 aperture, 1.55um pixels and unlimited Google Photos storage. On the front you get an 8-megapxiel camera.

It was the first update in 5 years. Unfortunately, the update was basically just a fresh Material Design paint job. A lot of features were actually removed, but Google promised “regular updates.” One of the features that will be coming in the future is something that Hangouts has had for a while. Google confirmed to 9to5 that they are working on bringing VoIP to Google Voice. For those that don’t know, VoIP stands for “voice over IP” a.k.a. voice calls over the internet. Currently, Google Voice can forward calls, but with VoIP, you could receive calls directly through your GV number. That would mean you could receive SMS and calls all through GV. We don’t have a timetable for when these new features will be rolled out, but it’s an exciting time for Google Voice once again. If only they hadn’t abandoned it for half a decade.

Yet Amazon.com Inc's surprise success sets up a long-term battle with Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc's Google for primacy in the connected household. And the contours of that competition are following a classic tech industry dynamic. Amazon is pursuing an open-systems approach that allows quick development of many features, while Apple is taking a slower route, asserting more control over the technology in order to assure security and ease-of-use. The strategic importance of the "connected home" niche looms large: Amazon wants a way to own its customer interactions -mainly shopping online - without an Apple phone or a Google Web browser as an intermediary. Apple needs to keep the iPhone at the center of customers’ lives, and has built a whole home automation architecture, called Homekit, into its smartphone. Google, for its part, is investing heavily in both intelligent assistant software and home-automation devices like the Nest thermostats and, more recently, the Google Home speaker. But Google is behind in the race, with its speaker only hitting the market in November and compatible with a handful of gadgets beyond Nest and Dropcam, which the company also owns. “When the iPhone rolled out in 2007, everyone developed [software] for that. Right now, everyone is developing for the voice-activated Internet,” said Mark Mahaney, an analyst and managing director with RBC Capital Markets. Mahaney estimates Amazon sold as many as 10 million Alexa-enabled devices over the holiday season. Google hasn't disclosed sales for its Home speaker. Apple has declined to comment on reports that it has a voice-activated speaker in the works. Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said the company is leading the industry by being the first to integrate home automation into a major platform with iOS 10. “The number of HomeKit-compatible accessories continues to grow rapidly with many exciting solutions announced just this month,” she said. For the smart home, the key developer partners are the makers of household devices ranging from lighting systems to refrigerators. There are currently about 250 devices that are certified to work with Alexa, and Amazon has encouraged rapid development of third-party applications with its open-systems approach and even financial incentives for some partners. Apple's Homekit, by contrast, has about 100 certified devices. And the reasons behind that gap show both the risks and the potential rewards of Apple's approach. HOW APPLE EXERTS CONTROL To be Homekit-certified, gadget makers must include special chips to work with Apple’s system. Developers that order small volumes of the chips say they can cost an 50 cents to $2, though prices are lower for larger buyers. Apple also requires developers to buy specific WiFi and Bluetooth networking chips that cost more than competitors. The devices have to be made in special factories that are certified by Apple. A confidential Apple document obtained by Reuters lists more than 800 of these factories, but only a few specialize in home automation products. Developers can ask Apple to certify an unlisted factory they want to use. But the limited selection means that device makers can't always get the best prices or work with their preferred factories. The founder of one startup that considered pursuing HomeKit approval for a device that helps control home temperatures said the company picked a factory with 40,000 employees that was making well known "Star Wars" toys, but it couldn't use that factory for HomeKit products. "They're a huge company, a legitimate manufacturer that makes tech household brands. And yet they're not [Apple] certified," said the founder, who declined to speak on the record because of non-disclosure agreements with Apple. Manufacturers also have to send product samples to Cupertino, where Apple tests them extensively for compatibility. The whole process can take three to five months. During that time, device makers aren't allowed to say publicly that they're pursuing HomeKit certification. Some developers say it's worth it. "They found issues with our product before we released it that we didn't find in our testing," said Gimmy Chu, CEO of Nanoleaf, a smart lighting system. "We know that after we have the certification that it's rock solid." AMAZON'S "OPEN" APPROACH Alexa, by contrast, only requires smart home companies to write software code and submit it to Amazon for review. There are no special chips. To earn the "Works with Alexa" label -which isn’t required to function with Alexa but does help promote products on Amazon’s website - startups must have their products physically tested. Amazon does allow that to happen in a third-party lab, however. Once those certifications are in hand, Amazon says it will decide whether or not a device gets the “Works with Alexa” label within 10 days. Apple's approach has some clear advantages when it comes to privacy, security and ease-of-use. HomeKit gadgets, for example, can operate without being connected to the Internet. (An iPad or Apple TV connected to the Internet is required if you want to control devices when you’re outside the house.) “It also makes for a better user experience,” notes Ahmed Abdallah, a senior engineer at Incipio, which makes HomeKit-compatible devices such as electrical outlets. “You’ll experience some latency if you’re always having to bounce off the cloud” as with Alexa. Apple also has an advantage around setup. iPhone owners open up the Home app and set up a device with just a few taps. With Alexa, customers have to download the gadget’s companion app first, set up the device, then add a “skill” to Alexa in the Alexa app. Apple's ease of setup lured in some big brands like Hunter Fan Company, the top-selling ceiling fan maker in the U.S. “If that experience isn’t good, it has a strong negative halo on the brand because customers just assume the product is bad,” said John Neilson, the company’s chief marketing officer. Amazon acknowledges that unlike Apple, it can't guarantee the security of third-party devices. A company spokeswoman did note that sensitive commands like unlocking doors have an extra layer of security such as a voice-controlled PIN. Still, it's not clear whether Apple's elaborate but slow-to-develop system will have enough advantages to overcome Amazon's widening lead. “The danger I see for Apple and the home is they’re assuming that because I have a smartphone that may be an Apple device, that alone is enough of a Trojan horse to establish their mindshare,” said Andreas Stavropoulos, a partner at venture capital firm DFJ. “I wouldn’t say that's certain yet.” (Editing by Jonathan Weber and Edward Tobin) SEARCH More from Sify: gold rate silver rate   Cities   Price (10g)   Gold Rate in Chennai   Rs. 28120.00 (-0.46%)   Gold Rate in Mumbai   Rs. 28830.00 (0.8%)   Gold Rate in Delhi   Rs. 28700.00 (0.35%)   Gold Rate in Kolkata   Rs. 28440.00 (-0.59%)   Gold Rate in Kerala   Rs. 27600.00 (-0.36%)   Gold Rate in Bangalore   Rs. 27750.00 (0%)   Gold Rate in Hyderabad   Rs. 28250.00 (-0.07%) more   Cities   Price (1 kg)   Silver Rate in Chennai   Rs. 41835.00 (-0.7%)   Silver Rate in Mumbai   Rs. 41835.00 (-0.7%)   Silver Rate in Delhi   Rs. 41835.00 (-0.7%)   Silver Rate in Kolkata   Rs. 41835.00 (-0.7%)   Silver Rate in Kerala   Rs. 41835.00 (-0.7%) more talking point on sify finance Latest News How Tamil Nadu's Jallikattu protests ended on a sour note Will Muslims bite the bait in UP?

Corporate sector optimism has gained further support from stronger consumer confidence and moderate growth in the energy sector, while anticipations of protectionist customs tariffs, lower taxes and greater infrastructure spending from the US budget have all brightened the outlook for this year. However, the still-high corporate taxes somewhat hindered the private sector sentiment. The Q4 earnings of Alphabet Inc., the owner of Google, surpassed previous estimates due to a rapid expansion of the company's cloud-computing services and a surge in YouTube advertising. High taxation rates, on the other hand, impaired the investors' cheer. © Flickr/ Heinrich-Böll-Stiftung Germany Follows US Fact-Checking Institute Sponsored by Soros on War Path Against 'Fake News'Google advertising advanced 17.4pc to $22.4 bln in 4Q16, and the expansion in Android app sales, hardware, such as Google phones, and cloud services has been buoyant and is poised to gain further momentum. Alphabet's revenue from other sources rose 62pc to $3.4 bln. Overall, Alphabet's revenue rose 23pc, by $21.2 bln year-on-year, compared to earlier market predictions of a $20.6-billion growth. Profit-per-equity, however, fell short of estimates at $9.36 compared to $9.63 expected earlier because of prohibitively high corporate taxes, at 22pc now compared to 5pc one year earlier. On Wall Street, Alphabet's stock dropped 2.2pc as lower profitability weighed on investor sentiment, stirring concern regarding excessive governmental interference and hindering the effects of an actual business expansion. "It was a good quarter revenue-wise, but margins were a little light because some of the strongest revenue growth came from licensing and other business that are less profitable," Ken Sena of Evercore ISI said. Another tech major, Microsoft, also beat earlier predictions, mainly due to the rapid expansion in its cloud services, where revenue almost doubled for certain products. Orders for hardware, such as data-center processors, also posted gains. "As long as the cloud is growing, people are happy," Mark Moerdler of Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. said. "If margins are growing, people are even happier." © Flickr/ Truthout.org Microsoft Workers Sue Over PTSD Caused by Porn - LawsuitOne of Microsoft's most popular products, cloud-powered Office 365, saw a greater demand from both individual and corporate clients, with sales having increased by 47pc. About 25 mln users have purchased a subscription to Office 365 at this point. Microsoft is aiming to increase its revenues to $20 bln per year in their cloud business alone. Currently, the figure stands at $14 bln. Meanwhile, Intel saw a 30-percent annualized increase in sales of cloud server chips. However, orders from private and governmental entities dropped 7pc year-on-year. "It's moving to the public cloud, it's moving to those areas at a faster rate than I think we expected," Brian Krzanich, Intel CEO, said. In other sectors, further gains in oil prices supported investor confidence in energy stocks, and overall, US corporate profits are poised to gain some 7pc for the fourth quarter, their largest gain in two years. "If all the economic data is good, if the earnings are good and the market doesn't really seem to think anything (President Trump) says or does is negative, I don't see any downside," Randy Frederick of Austin, TX-based Charles Schwab said. © AP Photo/ Richard Drew Wall Street Traders 'Should Have Been Jailed' For 2008 Financial CrisisThe US fourth quarter GDP report is expected early on Friday, and is likely to show a 2.2-percent expansion, typical for the weak Obama-era recovery, and insufficient to further boost the financial markets' sentiment. For this year, investors are expecting a 10-percent gain in their revenues, based off their expectations of the Trump administration's plan to invest $1 trln in infrastructure. However, as the current 10-year economic cycle draws to a close, the anticipated economic and financial market expansion might be damaged to profit-taking closer to the decade's end. "We think there is going to be a cost to this growth in the form of a downturn in 2019 — if we get the full Trump plan, there is a bigger boom in 2017 and 2018, then a bigger bust in 2019," Tim Drayson of Legal & General Investment Management said. ...

News Week In Review: Dow Hits 20K On Trump Rally; Boeing Hot, Google Iced The Dow industrials hit 20,000 as the Trump rally fueled infrastructure and financial stocks. (Adobe) IBD STAFF 1/27/2017 Reprints The Dow Jones industrial average hit 20,000 as the major averages rallied to fresh record highs on President Trump's early policy moves. Earnings reports generally were positive, but Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Starbucks (SBUX) were among those with disappointing results. M&A deals, buzz and rejections were rife. Dow Industrials Hit Milestone As Banks, Infrastructure Stocks Lead The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.3% for the week, topping 20,000 for the first time. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 also hit record highs, up 1.9% and 1%, respectively, amid a slew of earnings, including Intel (INTC), Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alibaba (BABA) and Boeing (BA). President Trump authorized a border wall and two key oil pipelines, lifting a wide variety of construction and materials related firms such as Caterpillar (CAT) and Martin Marietta Materials (MLM), but not steel makers. Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (FB) broke out, joining other FANG+ stocks. The 10-year Treasury yield rose, lifting bank stocks. Alphabet Earnings Fall Short Google parent Alphabet said Q4 earnings per share minus items rose 8% to $9.36, below views for $9.64. Total revenue rose 22% to $26.1 billion, topping forecasts for 25.26 billion. Revenue growth slowed from 28% in the prior-year period. The internet search and advertising giant faced tough comparisons with the prior-year quarter, when it launched new advertising products. Capital spending soared 46% to $3.1 billion, which much of that related to its cloud computing efforts. Marketing costs for Google's new Pixel smartphones also were heavy. Alphabet shares fell 1.4% on Friday after hitting record highs earlier in the week. RELATED: Alphabet Q4 EPS Misses Expectations Microsoft Expands As Cloud Business Booms Fiscal Q2 earnings rose 9% to 83 cents a share while revenue climbed 2% to $26.07 billion, beating views for 79 cents and $25.30 billion. Credit a booming cloud computing business, including Azure. Microsoft guided Q3 revenue forecasts higher. Microsoft shares rose nearly 5% for the week, hitting record highs. RELATED: Microsoft Beats Q2 Targets On Cloud Computing Strength Intel, Other Chip Earnings Strong The chipmaker's EPS rose 4%, topping views, while its 10% sales growth was the best in four years. Intel also gave bullish guidance. Intel shares rose 1.1% Friday after breaking out of a base earlier in the week ahead of earnings. Texas Instruments (TXN) also reported strong earnings, while Samsung Electronics credit memory chip gains for its overall Q4 profit revival. Microsemi (MSCC) also had good results, along with chip gear makers Lam Research (LRCX) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC). But mobile chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM), facing FTC charges and Apple lawsuits over its licensing practices, reported mixed results. RELATED: Intel Q4 Earnings, Sales Top Expectations, Revenue Guidance Also Beats U.S. Economic Malaise Hits 11 Years The economy expanded at a 1.9% annual rate in the fourth quarter, below views for 2.2% and not much more than half of Q3's 3.5% gain. For 2016, U.S. GDP grew just 1.6%, the 11th straight year below 3%. Meanwhile, durable goods orders unexpectedly fell for a second straight month in December. New-home sales tumbled to a 10-month low, though several homebuilders remained bullish after reporting solid earnings. Starbucks, McDonald's Revivals Doubted Starbucks (SBUX) reported its weakest earnings growth in five years, though that met views. Sales missed forecasts with customer traffic down 2%. The coffee shop giant, which also cut its revenue outlook, said its mobile order and pay was so popular that it created bottlenecks at order pick up, turning off some patrons. Starbucks shares fell 4% on Friday. Meanwhile, McDonald's (MCD) topped EPS and sales targets but U.S. comps fell as investors questioned if the momentum from the all-day breakfast menu has run out. McDonald's tested key support levels initially but closed the week up 0.5%. RELATED: Too Much Of A Good Thing? This Weighed On Starbucks' U.S. Performance McDonald's Stock Tests Key Support Amid Turnaround Doubts Judge Blocks Aetna-Humana Deal A federal judge ruled that the $37 billion Aetna (AET)-Humana (HUM) merger would violate antitrust laws by unduly reducing competition among health insurers. Aetna, which owes Humana a $1 billion breakup fee, may appeal. The deal also throws into doubt the proposed $48 billion Anthem (ANTM)-Cigna (CI) merger deal, which the Justice Department also opposes. RELATED: Aetna's $37 Billion Deal For Humana Blocked By Federal Judge Steel Stocks Break 50-Day Lines, Try To Recover Several steel makers sold off during the week, breaking below their 50-day lines as earnings reports failed to support stocks after a postelection run, even as President Trump touted various infrastructure plans and signaled more protectionism. AK Steel (AKS) topped views Tuesday, but shares reversed sharply lower on a weak pricing outlook. Steel Dynamics (STLD), which had decent earnings late Tuesday, tumbled Wednesday. Larger peers U.S. Steel (X) and Nucor (NUE), which both report on Jan. 31, also sold off. But many of the steel makers rebounded Thursday and Friday. On the upside, specialty steel firm Allegheny Steel (ATI) delivered stellar earnings Tuesday, sending shares up 31% that day. RELATED: Steel Stocks Break Key Support Even As Trump Rally Resumes AK, Allegheny Earnings Top, Steel Dynamics Meets; Steel Stocks Bend Both Ways Boeing Flies, Lockheed Falters Boeing (BA) emphasized the importance of trade with China for aerospace industry jobs in the U.S. but is bullish about President Trump's tax reforms and regulations. Boeing reported Q4 EPS and revenue above analyst views. Its guidance was cautious, but its 787 Dreamliner is now cash flow positive,which bodes well for future stock buybacks and dividend increases. Boeing shares broke out of a base, hitting record highs. Lockheed Martin (LMT) reported Q4 earnings and revenue above analyst views with aeronautics revenue, which includes F-35 sales, soaring 23% to $5.41 billion. It expects a surge in F-35 deliveries this year. But Lockheed gave weak guidance amid continued concerns about F-35 costs, sending shares lower. Northrop Grumman (NOC) beat on Q4 views while Raytheon (RTN) fell short. Like Boeing and Lockheed, they gave weak guidance. General Dynamics (GD) reported strong earnings and gave bullish long-term guidance.

Verizon reported a mixed Q4, with revenue falling 5.4% but beating estimates while EPS was light. Wireless margins missed. Management pushed back its goal of returning to wireless service growth to 2018. The close of Verizon's purchase of Yahoo (YHOO) will be delayed until Q2 as regulators look into its data breaches. AT&T (T) reported in-line Q4 EPS, with revenue and EBITDA slightly below consensus. AT&T again lost wireless postpaid phone subscribers. AT&T remained upbeat on regulatory approval of its Time Warner (TWX) acquisition. Comcast (CMCSA) Q4 earnings topped views amid solid subscriber gains. The cable TV firm plans to buy back $5 billion in shares in 2017, hiked its dividend and announced a 2-for-1 stock split. Comcast plans to launch its wireless service buy midyear. Comcast rose 3% for the week to new highs. RELATED: Verizon Stock Falls; EPS, Revenue Outlook More Of The Same Verizon, Charter Talks Heating Up?

J&J Makes Big Buys As Pharma Results Mixed Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) agreed to pay $30 billion for Swiss biotech Actelion. J&J reported weak sales and guidance earlier in the week. Celgene (CELG) missed on sales even after preannouncing Q4 results. Biogen (BIIB) stock popped despite light sales on "better-than-feared" 2017 guidance following its hemophilia unit spinoff. Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) missed on earnings and gave weak EPS guidance amid weaker lung cancer drug prospects.

Along with bullish guidance, the results suggested a multiyear slump disk-drive shipments may have bottomed. Both companies are also investing heavily in flash-based chip storage, following market needs. Seagate shares shot up 22% and Western Digital 9%, both setting 15-month bests. RELATED: Western Digital Gets Positive Reviews On 'Crisp Execution' Alibaba Soars On Strong Q3 Alibaba (BABA) revenue rose 54% in local currency to $7.67 billion, with EPS rising 30% to $1.30 above views.

RELATED: Alibaba Crushes Earnings Estimates, Raises Guidance Ford: U.S. Plants 'Appropriate' Ford (F) topped fourth-quarter results expectations, and sees a sluggish 2017. CEO Mark Fields said the automaker has the right amount of U.S. plants it needs, despite President Trump's call days earlier for the Big 3 to build more U.S. factories. Fiat Chrysler (FCAU), meanwhile, said net income doubled, helped by cost savings, while revenue ticked up 1% to $31.4 billion. Ford CEO Says U.S. Plants 'Appropriate'; Q4 Profit Meets, Sales Top Cisco Buys Almost-IPO AppDynamics For Hefty Premium Cisco Systems (CSCO) late Tuesday announced it would buy AppDynamics for $3.7 billion, a day before the latter was expected to price an IPO with a top target valuation of $1.7 billion.

Reuters/Beck Diefenbach The Google Pixel has been lauded since its launch and is now considered one of the best smartphones in the industry despite its rookie status in the mobile phone game. If there’s one criticism that has repeatedly hounded Google about its first “official” phone, it’s the fact that the handset isn’t waterproof. The tech giant is reportedly going to make up for it, but fans will have to wait for the next Pixel release before they can enjoy the essential feature. The Pixel and Pixel XL actually both have a certified immersion rating of IP-53, but the handsets cannot be completely submerged underwater. The IP-53 rating means that only splashes and sprays from a maximum of 60 degrees high are allowed to come in contact with both phones, allowing Pixel and Pixel XL owners to still use their handsets for calling in the middle of a rain storm. Google even called the Pixel and Pixel XL “splash-proof” in an earlier ad, a subtle admission of its phones’ limits. Fortunately, Google may just right the wrong on the Pixel 2 and Pixel XL 2. According to insider Stephen Hall of 9to5Google, he and his crew were told in October of last year that the ultimate successors of the current Pixel and Pixel XL shall “definitely” have waterproofing features. (See tweet below) Last year, when Google was asked why the Pixel and Pixel XL weren’t made waterproof, the company simply answered it “ran out of time.” Google had originally intended to make both Pixel phones waterproof, but it had to re-evaluate the handsets’ development in early 2016 and was left with roughly nine months to finalise the smartphones before they were launched. The timeframe was too short even for a mammoth like Google especially since it still had to work with HTC during that busy period. Little tidbit we were told in October last year that I forgot about: “Waterproofing definitely coming with next Pixel device.” &mdash; Stephen Hall (@hallstephenj) January 25, 2017 RELATED STORIES: Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge vs Google Pixel XL: Battery capacity and charging comparison Google explains why its new Pixel phone is not fully waterproof Submit Correction 0 0 0 Related HTC U Ultra vs Google Pixel XL Google Pixel vs Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge Join the Discussion 0 0 0 Search Most Shared Most Read 1 Australian Open 2017: Boris Becker predicts Roger Federer vs Rafael Nadal final 0 Shares 2 ‘Better Call Saul’ season 3: Return of another ‘Breaking Bad’ character confirmed 0 Shares 3 'Days Of Our Lives' spoilers for Jan. 23: Hope fights for her life; Chloe comes clean to Brady but refuses to give up the baby 0 Shares 4 Dell XPS 15 vs Apple MacBook Pro 2016 0 Shares 5 Golden State Warriors vs Miami Heat live stream: Watch NBA live on TV, preview, start time 0 Shares 6 ‘Outlander’ season 3: Mr Willoughby cast 0 Shares 7 'Outlander' season 3 will be like a 'wee treasure hunt' 0 Shares 8 Rafael Nadal vs Grigor Dimitrov live stream: Watch Australian Open 2017 semi-final online, start time, betting odds 0 Shares 9 ‘Vikings’ season 4 episode 19, 20 leaked reportedly 0 Shares 10 ‘The X-Files’ season 11 expected to premiere in 2018 0 Shares Follow Us Please enter a valid email Like us Follow us Full site feed Optus closes $75 million deal with Flight Centre Dreamworld tragedy: Weak attendance at theme parks affecting Village Roadshow Pumpkin Patch to shutter all stores by mid-February OpenText director reveals user context is key to achieving workplace efficiency Qantas order Boeing 787 Dreamliner for long flights Australia's houses and apartments below $1 million More Business Economy Markets Companies Real Estate Banking & Finance 5-year-old dies from suspected methadone overdose Bourke St tragedy: Friends, family come together to honour the victims Sydney weather: few more warm nights ahead Police officers attacked, taken to hospital while arresting carjackers in Qld Claremont serial killings: Bradley Edwards appears in court for second time One dead, seven injured after bus crashes, rolls over on NSW highway More News Australia Asia Pacific Africa The Americas Europe Middle East Los Angeles Lakers vs Utah Jazz live stream: Watch NBA live on TV, preview, start time NBA Trade News: Cavaliers rebuff Carmelo Anthony, Kevin Love swap WWE WrestleMania 33: Eight matches already booked, Possible WWE Royal Rumble 2017 winner Roger Federer vs Stan Wawrinka live stream: 2017 Australian Open, where to watch live, start time, preview, betting odds NBA Trade News: Clippers likely to acquire Carmelo Anthony without losing Big 3 Rafael Nadal vs Grigor Dimitrov live stream: Watch Australian Open 2017 semi-final online, start time, betting odds More Sports AFL NRL Rugby Union Cricket Soccer Tennis Motor Sports Basketball NFL Fight Sports More 'The Last Of Us 2': Politics to reflect Neil Druckmann's views 'Grand Theft Auto 6' update: Map and protagonist possibilities 'Kingdom Hearts 3': Game artist promises high quality for next chapter 2017 Year of the Fire Rooster: Meaning, characteristics of Fire Rooster ‘Pokemon Sun and Moon’ & Nintendo 3DS keep fans busy ‘Pokemon GO’ big update anytime soon More Life Environment & Science Health & Wellbeing Gaming Technology Travel & Food Fashion & Beauty Art & Design 'Days Of Our Lives' spoilers for Jan. 26: Death knocks on a Salemite’s door; things heat up between two couples ‘Neighbours’ spoilers for Jan. 26: On Australia Day, a kidnapping horrifies Ramsay Street; Paige gears up to reveal her baby’s father 'General Hospital' spoilers for Jan. 26, 2017: Liz reveals her suspicions on Tom’s murder; Sonny offers words of wisdom to Nelle 'The Young and the Restless' spoilers for Jan. 26, 2017: Reed opens up to Nikki; Cane and Billy square off; Paul fears the worst for Dylan ‘Westworld’ season 2 to reveal what really happened to Ford ‘The Bold And The Beautiful’ spoilers for Jan. 26: Quinn makes Ridge an offer he can’t resist; Thomas jumps into the fray More Entertainment Movies TV Celebrities Music McLaren 570GT Review: Grand, But No Touring Car IBTimes Newsletters Sign up to get the latest headlines delivered to your inbox every morning.

ByLiam Tung | January 27, 2017 -- 12:56 GMT (04:56 PST) | Topic: Security The new indicator in Chrome 56 stating 'Not secure' for HTTP login or payment pages will eventually apply to other HTTP pages. Image: Google Google's Chrome 56 launch this week ushers in its plan to begin warning users that all HTTP pages are not secure, starting with the pages that collect login details or credit-card numbers. Given Chrome has more than one billion users, this change to Chrome is likely to pressure website operators to at least consider enabling site-wide HTTPS. Chrome will also call out companies that aren't doing the basics of protecting sensitive user information by collecting information on an unencrypted connection. This move shouldn't come as a surprise to website owners. Google first flagged up this change to Chrome's HTTPS warnings in September and issued an alert to site operators in December. Until now, Chrome only showed a neutral grey indicator on an HTTP page, which Google's Chrome security team thinks doesn't accurately represent the total lack of security HTTP offers. For example, if you're on a Wi-Fi hotspot, a third-party on that network can tamper with the contents of an HTTP page. HTTPS on the other hand can mitigate the threat of man-in-the-middle attacks, or surveillance techniques. The new indicator in Chrome 56 and onwards states 'Not secure' for HTTP login or payment pages and will eventually apply the same warnings for other HTTP pages. Google is also pushing developers to move to HTTPS to enable apps with access to more powerful hardware features, such as the camera and mic, which can capture sensitive information. With this update, Google also paid out $53,837 to security researchers in its bug bounty program for Chrome. Google fixed a total of 51 security bugs in earlier versions of Chrome. In a bid accelerate its own adoption of HTTPS, Google has also gained greater control over the digital SSL/TLS certificates used to validate and encrypt HTTPS sites. The company announced on Thursday that it had become its own root certificate authority, or CA, which can issue and revoke certificates. It's actually been operating a subordinate CA for several months to support its own certificate needs for Google products. However, in December it began operating its own root certificate authority. It's established a new company, called Google Trust Services, which will operate the CAs. If you visit Google or any of its other pages and click the padlock icon to reveal and view the certificate, it will state the certificate was issued by Google Internet Authority G2 or GIAG2, rather than, say, another large CA, such as Symantec or GoDaddy. It's not clear whether Google will provide CA services to third-party sites. "We have been operating our own subordinate Certificate Authority (GIAG2), issued by a third party. This has been a key element enabling us to more rapidly handle the SSL/TLS certificate needs of Google products," said Ryan Hurst, from Google's security and privacy engineering team. "The process of embedding Root Certificates into products and waiting for the associated versions of those products to be broadly deployed can take time. For this reason we have also purchased two existing Root Certificate Authorities, GlobalSign R2 and R4. These Root Certificates will enable us to begin independent certificate issuance sooner rather than later," he added. Google will continue to operate its existing GIAG2 subordinate Certificate Authority and has outlined two root certificates that developers must use if they intend to connect to Google's services. As one commenter on Hacker News pointed out, this move gives Google one more key piece of the internet's infrastructure: "You can now have a website secured by a certificate issued by a Google CA, hosted on Google web infrastructure, with a domain registered using Google Domains, resolved using Google Public DNS, going over Google Fiber, in Google Chrome on a Google Chromebook. Google has officially vertically integrated the internet."

Recode reports that many publishers have been banned from the Google AdSense network, which allows website owners to place Google approved advertisements on their website in exchange for royalties and aims to deliver appropriate ads based on the website’s content. A new policy change prohibits sites that mislead users with their content, resulting in over 200 websites being banned from the network. SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER Google also reported that they removed 1.7 billion ads for policy violations in 2016 compared to 780 million in 2015. Google indicated a combination of advertiser behaviour and improved automatic detection of policy violations led to the increase.  Google also cracked down on websites that posed as legitimated tabloid newspapers only to redirect users to purchase pages for diet and health supplements. Approximately 1300 of these websites were suspended in 2016. Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

Google disabled more than 68 million bad ads for healthcare violations and 17 million bad ads for illegal gambling violations in 2016. Internet giant Google today said it took down 1.7 billion ads in 2016 that violated its advertising policies, more than double the number of “bad ads” it banned in 2015. These ads were misleading, promoted illegal products and unrealistic offers or were inappropriate, according to Google’s annual ‘Better Ads Report’ for 2016. The most common inappropriate online ads were for illegal products. Google disabled more than 68 million bad ads for healthcare violations and 17 million bad ads for illegal gambling violations in 2016. Read: Google’s Pixel phone shines despite misgauging demand “A free and open web is a vital resource for people and businesses around the world. And ads play a key role in ensuring you have access to accurate, quality information online. But bad ads can ruin the online experience for everyone,” Google Director of Product Management Sustainable Ads Scott Spencer said. He added “bad ads” can trick people into sharing personal information and infect devices with harmful software. “Ultimately, bad ads pose a threat to users, Google’s partners, and the sustainability of the open web itself,” he said. Last year, Google expanded its policies to better protect users from misleading and predatory offers. In July, it introduced a policy to ban ads for payday loans, which often resulted in unaffordable payments and high default rates for users. Read: Google to shutdown versions of Docs, Drive, Sheets, Slides app from April 3 “In the six months since launching this policy, we disabled more than 5 million payday loan ads,” Google said. Google also beefed up its technology to spot and disable bad ads even faster. “For example, ‘trick to click’ ads often appear as system warnings to deceive users into clicking on them, not realizing they are often downloading harmful software or malware. In 2016, Google detected and disabled a total of 112 million ads for ‘trick to click’, 6X more than in 2015,” the report said. For ads developed exclusively for the mobile web, Google’s systems detected and disabled over 23,000 ‘self-clicking ads’ on its platforms this year as compared to only having to disable a few thousand of these bad ads last year. Similarly, the report highlighted a dramatic increase in scamming activity in 2016 and close to 7 million bad ads were disabled for intentionally attempting to trick the Google detection systems. Read: Gmail users can’t send Javascript files from February 13 Year 2016 also saw rise of a new type of scammers called ‘tabloid cloakers’ that take advantage of current trends and hot topics, for example a government election, a trending news story or a well-known celebrity. The ads used by these scammers may look like headlines for real articles on a news website but when clicked upon, consumers are redirected to a site selling weight loss products. In 2016, Google suspended over 1,300 accounts for tabloid cloaking. In December alone, Google took down 22 cloakers that were responsible for ads seen over 20 million times by people online in a single week. In 2016, Google took action on 47,000 sites for promoting content and products related to weight-loss scams. It also took action on more than 15,000 sites for unwanted software and disabled 900,000 ads for containing malware.

For those that have the need for speed, here we’ll be sharing 10 of our favorite racing games on Android. These are the best available in 2016. Playing games on our Android smartphones and tablets is becoming increasingly more popular thanks to a huge selection. Not to mention big HD displays and powerful processors inside devices like the Galaxy S7 or Google Pixel. Racing games are extremely popular but it can be hard to find the good ones. Read: 10 Best First Person Shooter Games for Android Whether you’re looking for ultra realistic racing, casual arcade fun, or want to be flying through water with turbo boosts and more, we have it all covered. Here we highlight some of the better looking games available. These are fun, free, or at least worth spending your hard earned money on. Over the past year or two Android games have improved by leaps and bounds, and are getting better with each release. Not to mention Android 7.0 Nougat and its new Vulcan gaming API promises to deliver a whole new level of quality. The games detailed below will keep you busy for hours, and on the edge of your seat. We’re starting with Asphalt 8: Airborne, as it’s still my favorite all-around game on Android. Well, unless you consider Clash of Clans. Then take a peek at the slideshow below for nine other great games that made our list. As we said above, there are hundreds and hundreds of games available from the Google Play Store. And while some are decent, many of them are poor copies of others and not worth the time it’ll take to download. So instead of wasting time and data, or your money, check out this list of some of the most popular racing games available on Android right now. Many are from 2015, but more are coming soon. Asphalt 8: Airborne   1 / 10 Our first pick and still my favorite racing game to date comes from Gameloft, who has now released over eight versions of their flagship racing game for Android. Asphalt 8: Airborne does away with all the simulator realism and goes for high speeds, octane boosters, and flying down realistic streets with natural lighting, shadows, and reflections all while trying to get the most air as possible going over jumps and taking shortcuts. All of this is done while having some of the best graphics on a mobile device. Asphalt 8 delivers realistic crashes and extensive vehicle damage, it has both arcade and multiplayer modes, and the career mode will have you build up a reputation, and earn additional cars for the garage. This has been my favorite game since its release, and Asphalt 7 is still a close second. It's my go-to mobile game to show off how far mobile gaming has come, and will continue to be one of my favorites that is on every tablet or smartphone I own. There is no Asphalt 9 yet, but instead you can try Asphalt Overdrive, which is more of an endless racer. It isn't quite as fun, but still worth consideration. We're hoping for an Asphalt 9 in 2017. Those with an older device that can't play Asphalt 8, download Asphalt Nitro. It's made for budget devices. Another good option is a game called City Racer. Download from Google Play Asphalt Xtreme was just released in November, and is the same racing game we all love, taken to the dirt. It's Asphalt Off-Road essentially, and loads of fun. Not to mention some of the best graphics around. Download it now.    1 / 10 27 Responses 06/10/2015 mousavian Reply thanks 12/08/2016 ateeq Reply new car racing game https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fast.car.racing.real.speed 08/06/2015 Fahad Ullah Khan Reply Nice !

I saw this on PC Advisor and thought you should see it too. Comments What is the best big phone? Best big phone RRP Key specifications Xiaomi Mi Mix £799 MIUI 8 (Android 6.0), Snapdragon 821, 6GB RAM, 256GB storage, 6.4in edgeless full-HD, 4400mAh Samsung Galaxy S7 edge £639 Android 6.0 Marshmallow, Exynos 8890, 4GB RAM, 32GB storage, 5.5in Quad-HD, 3600mAh OnePlus 3T £329 OxygenOS (Android 6.0), Snapdragon 821, 6GB RAM, 64GB storage, 5.5in Full-HD, 3200mAh Jump straight to our full best big phones chart Need a big phone? We round up the best phablets and large-screen phones you can buy in the UK in 2017. Best big phone reviews. Also see Best smartphones 2017 and Best tablets 2017. Also see: Best Phone Deals Many a time we've been guilty of reviewing a smartphone and blasting it for not fitting comfortably in the palm of your hand, or for requiring two hands for comfortable operation. But every one of us is different, and while some of us prefer our phones sleek and compact, others prefer them big and powerful.  Large-screen phones aren't useful only for those with poor eyesight or fat fingers, they're also a good fit for avid mobile gamers and those who watch a lot of video. Also see: Best kids' phones 2017 Generally speaking, a phablet (as they are known in the industry - a cross between phone and tablet) should be no less powerful than a standard smartphone. With more room inside the case they tend to have higher-capacity batteries, but you should also take into account that their larger screens may drain power faster than the smaller screens of phones with lower-capacity batteries. We class smartphones with screens of 5.5in-plus on the diagonal as phablets. Take into account that the number of pixels will be stretched over a larger screen area, so a Quad-HD screen will be appreciated here more than it would on a compact phone. That said, though, even a full-HD screen will look crystal clear on a big phone - just watch out for anything lower in resolution than this. Note that before you buy the Galaxy S7 edge in second place a new version is likely to be announced within the next few months (tipped for March) - see our Galaxy S8 rumour round-up. Below we present our pick of the 20 best big phones you can buy in the UK in 2017. Read next: Best new phones coming in 2017 20 best big phones 2017 1. Xiaomi Mi Mix Rating: Reviewed on: 9 January 17 RRP: £799.91 inc. VAT Buy from GearBest Compare: all Xiaomi Mi Mix deals It might sound expensive, but the £799 Xiaomi Mi Mix actually offers very good value when you consider its meaty core hardware and generous 256GB of storage - it's certainly less than you'd pay for an iPhone 7 Plus. This isn't a phone you buy with budget in mind, however: the Mi Mix is the phone you buy when you want onlookers to say "Oh my gosh, what is that? It's amazing - I want one of those!" The Mi Mix is a revolutionary phone that we hope is a sign of things to come, with that gorgeous bezel-less display, beautiful ceramic body, fantastic performance, long, long battery life and all the other fancy tech we can't even pronounce, let alone understand. No matter - it works. Highly recommended. Read our Xiaomi Mi Mix review. 2. Samsung Galaxy S7 edge Rating: Reviewed on: 12 January 17 RRP: £639 inc VAT Compare: all Samsung Galaxy S7 edge deals The Galaxy S7 edge is no longer the semi-gimmick it was before. Although some of the main features are things from the Galaxy S5 – Micro-SD and waterproofing – Samsung has given fans what they want. It's now a refined, sophisticated and highly desirable piece of technology. The battery isn't removable but the phone lasts longer than before and has seriously powerful specs under the hood. It has almost everything you could want from a phone even though the IR blaster is gone. We're also very impressed with the new camera and unless the screen is too big for you (despite some software features to help out) we think it's worth getting the S7 edge for the extra £70 with its gorgeous looks and extra functionality. Right now, this is the best smartphone money can buy. Read our Samsung Galaxy S7 edge review. 3. OnePlus 3T Rating: Reviewed on: 4 January 17 RRP: From £399 Buy from OnePlus Compare: all OnePlus 3T deals The OnePlus 3T will be unfairly compared, for now at least, to the phone that came before it. So let’s ignore it. On its own, the OnePlus 3T is everything a modern smartphone should be; slim, fast, and responsive, with above average battery life and cameras that produce stunning images. And then there’s the price. OnePlus may not like being known for it, but £399 remains an absolutely amazing price point for the phone on offer. As long as you don’t want an iPhone, this Android handset stands side by side with the Samsung Galaxy S7 as the best example of a smartphone on the market today – once we’ve all got over that it came a little sooner than we had expected. Read our OnePlus 3T review. 4. Huawei Mate 9 Rating: Reviewed on: 12 January 17 RRP: £599.99 Compare: all Huawei Mate 9 deals Huawei’s Mate 9 is, in our opinion, the best in the Huawei line-up, boasting an impressively large battery alongside powerful internals, an improved dual-camera setup and a sleek, gorgeous design. The benchmark results were some of the best we've seen, bringing excellent value for money. EMUI 5 makes a huge difference to the overall experience too, and we can’t wait to see whether Huawei’s new technology will actually improve the performance of the smartphone over time. Read our Huawei Mate 9 review. 5. Google Nexus 6P Rating: Reviewed on: 28 April 16 RRP: From £449 inc VAT Compare: all Google Nexus 6P deals Originally, Nexus phones stood out for being excellent value at a price that was low, but not the lowest. They weren't an alternative to flagship phones, but they had the advantage of running stock Android and getting the next version more quickly. The 6P, though, is not only a flagship, but is arguably the best Android phone to buy at the moment. It won't suit everyone due to its size, nor those looking for a phone with dual-SIM slots or a removable battery. There's no support for wireless charging either. But the excellent screen, front-firing speakers, quick charging, great cameras, speedy performance and Android Marshmallow add up to make this a phone that's a pleasure to use. And yes, it's also cheaper than its rivals, so unless you think it's worth shelling out extra on the Note 5, Galaxy S6 Edge+ or iPhone 6S Plus, the Nexus 6P is the one to buy. Read our Google Nexus 6P review. 6. Apple iPhone 7 Plus Rating: Reviewed on: 19 October 16 RRP: £719 (32GB); £819 (128GB); £919 (256GB)   The iPhone 7 Plus is an excellent phone. It’s Apple’s best yet, but it is also Apple’s most expensive yet, with a huge starting price. In some respects, the upgrades seem to justify this, but at the same time some features are arguably only catching up with what the competition has been offering for a while now – water-resistance for one. Taken as a whole, the performance, battery life, camera quality and stereo speakers are all compelling reasons to upgrade. But our advice remains much the same as for the iPhone 7: if you already own the previous generation, there’s not enough here to justify ditching a 6S Plus, especially if you’re halfway through a two-year contract. Those just coming out of contract on the iPhone 6 or 6 Plus would do well to grab a 7 Plus.   Read our Apple iPhone 7 Plus review. 7. Xiaomi Mi Note 2 Rating: Reviewed on: 8 December 16 RRP: £472.99 Buy from GearBest The Mi Note 2 was wrongly overshadowed at its launch. This is a gorgeous big-screen Android phone with very decent performance, a great camera and plenty of storage. We'd like to see a Quad-HD screen on Xiaomi's flagship phone, but this one should prove plenty sharp and clear. Google apps are not preinstalled, but there is a workaround if you are happy to do some tweaking. Read our Xiaomi Mi Note 2 review. 8. Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Rating: Reviewed on: 15 October 15 RRP: £484.99 Buy from Samsung So, what do we think of the Galaxy Note 5? We’re very fond of just about every aspect of the Galaxy Note 5, from its curved and sleek design to its vibrant display and high-resolution camera. It can handle almost anything you can throw at it thanks to its CPU, GPU and 4GB of RAM and we experienced no lag during our testing. The only bad point is that the Note 5 would sometimes falsely detect the S Pen detaching – and to point out such a minor fault says a lot about the quality of the handset. With this being said, we’re both surprised and sad that the Galaxy Note 5 won’t be heading to UK shores any time soon. Read our Samsung Galaxy Note 5 review. 9. iPhone 6s Plus Rating: Reviewed on: 9 September 16 RRP: From £619 inc VAT The iPhone 6S Plus is a remarkable phone, and it's still a fantastic phone 12 months on. The 16GB model has finally been banished and the new minimum storage of 32GB should be workable for a lot of people. 3D Touch can sound gimmicky, but it’s absolutely not. It requires effort to force yourself to use it to begin with, but it quickly becomes second nature and app developers have put it to use in apps and games. Read our iPhone 6s Plus review. 10. Google Pixel XL Rating: Reviewed on: 24 October 16 RRP: £719 (32GB) £819 (128GB) While the Pixel XL is an attractive phone (if you can get used to the glass section) with decent combination of hardware and software, we can't help but feel a bit disappointed. It's very similar to the much cheaper Nexus 6P and OnePlus 3. You can get plenty of other Android phones for less which have extra features like waterproofing and expandable storage. Sorry Google, but things have gone a bit wrong here. Read our Google Pixel XL review. 11. Huawei P9 Plus Rating: Reviewed on: 6 September 16 RRP: £629 inc VAT If you’re in the market for a sleek, premium phablet with a great dual-camera setup, the Huawei P9 Plus is a great option. The 5.5in SuperAMOLED FHD display is bright and crisp, and shows off the detailed photos taken by the rear-facing dual 12Mp snappers. The processor is strong enough to compete with Samsung’s Galaxy S7, although it doesn’t quite compare in terms of graphical power. However, it’s worth noting that there aren’t huge differences between the P9 Plus and the flagship P9 so depending on what you want from the smartphone, it may be worth taking a look at the £100 cheaper Huawei P9. Otherwise, it’s a decent premium flagship that we’re impressed with. Read our Huawei P9 Plus review. 12. Xiaomi Mi Max Rating: Reviewed on: 29 June 16 RRP: £212.04 Buy from Xiaomi Tech If you want a huge phone and you don’t want to pay as large a wedge of cash, the Xiaomi Mi Max is a fantastic phablet with good looks, decent performance, strong runtime and, most importantly of all, a gigantic screen. Not ideal for novice users, but otherwise the Mi Max is a highly recommended smartphone. Read our Xiaomi Mi Max review. 13. LG G4 Rating: Reviewed on: 19 August 15 RRP: £500 inc VAT LG has gone down an unexpected route with leather models which we like apart from a couple of colours. The so called ceramic model will be cheaper but feels cheap and plasticky. On the whole, hardware is once again strong - particularly the camera - but not massively different from the G3 and has tough competition. We feel build quality could be better with a metal frame and dimensions going down, not the reverse. This is the flagship to go for if you want a removable battery and expandable storage but it's a shame to see features like wireless charging dropped. (Remember the G3 is now a steal at under £300 SIM-free and the OnePlus 2 is now here) Read our LG G4 review. 14. Xiaomi Redmi Pro Rating: Reviewed on: 21 September 16 RRP: £256.04 inc. VAT Buy from GearBest The Xiaomi Redmi Pro offers unbeatable value for money at around £250, undercutting every flagship yet offering much the same performance and many comparable features. Due to the lack of Google Play and a number of Chinese preinstalled apps we’d recommend Xiaomi phones only to seasoned Android users, however. Read our Xiaomi Redmi Pro review. 15. Lenovo P2 Rating: Reviewed on: 26 January 17 RRP: £199.99 Buy from Three The Lenovo P2 is really being sold on the strength of its battery, and the great news is that it lives up to the company’s hype, offering you days of usage and a power bank in a pinch. Throw in the premium design and build quality, and you have a phone that delivers tremendous value for money. It may not boast flagship performance, but by the time you hit your third day without charging, you’re not likely to care that much. Read our Lenovo P2 review. 16. Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 Rating: Reviewed on: 16 January 17 RRP: £192.93 inc. VAT Buy from GearBest The Redmi Note 4 isn’t a huge upgrade over the Redmi Note 3 in terms of core hardware, with simply a greater amount of storage and a faster processor, but the design changes are a huge improvement over its predecessor. If you don’t care about looks and can make do with less storage then the cheaper Redmi Note 3 may well meet your needs. The Redmi Note 4 remains a great buy, but the omission of Google Play support may put off some users. O2 and Giffgaff customers should also note the lack of support for 800MHz 4G.

Elephone S7 Rating: Reviewed on: 12 January 17 RRP: £177.11 Buy from TomTop The Elephone S7 is a very good-looking phone at an affordable price, with decent performance and a generous helping of storage. On the down side the cameras are disappointing and the rear panel is plastic. Even at this price you don't need to compromise so heavily. Read our Elephone S7 review. 18. Moto Z Play Rating: Reviewed on: 11 November 16 RRP: £379.99 inc VAT The Moto Mods accessories are the main reason to buy the Moto Z Play, but it's a decent mid-range phone regardless. For an affordable price Lenovo offers premium design, good specs and a well-rounded software experience. You only really need to splash out on the Moto Z for the Quad HD screen, Snapdragon 820 and OIS camera should you feel the need for those features (but also bear in mind the more expensive version has no headphone jack and a smaller battery).

VAT Buy from GearBest The ZenFone 3 is a good all-round mid-range phone with decent performance and some nice extras under £300, but also a fair amount of bloatware. It's quite an update on the ZenFone 2, and definitely worth considering as an upgrade. Read our Asus ZenFone 3 review. 20. Vodafone Smart Ultra 7 Rating: Reviewed on: 19 July 16 RRP: £135 Vodafone’s Smart Ultra 7 in our opinion isn’t really an upgrade over the Smart Ultra 6. It’s £10 more expensive than the previous model and doesn’t really perform as well – the Smart 7 had worse benchmarking results than its predecessor in GFXBench, scoring 13fps compared to 14fps in T-Rex and 5.3fps compared to 5.7fps in Manhattan, although the Smart Ultra 7 bested the 6 in Geekbench 3 with results of 3002 compared to 2469. The camera, though the same on paper, seems to have had a slight downgrade too, producing rather washed out photos during testing. On the other hand, the 5.5in 1080p HD display is vibrant and crisp, and one must remember that the smartphone only costs £135 so if you are on a budget, it’s still a solid option.
