However, the business employs 45 people. “We do a lot of collaborative work with clients,” says Jim Bowes, chief executive. “On a normal day many of our people will be in clients’ offices.” Yet they will all be working on the same projects. Staff, he explains, use collaboration tools such as Slack, Trello, Confluence and Google Drive to work on projects together wherever they happen to be. Collaborative working, where people in different locations and organisations work on the same projects, is not new. What is new is how much easier and more widespread it has become. This is principally down to the proliferation of readily available, inexpensive, user-friendly tech tools, although changes in business culture and working patterns have also been significant contributors. “Video conferencing was shaky five years ago,” says Giles Palmer, founder of the social media monitoring company Brandwatch. “Now it is often really good for synchronous communication. Internal messaging systems like Slack and Yammer have shortened the distance between colleagues. Google docs is another application that has totally changed the way many people can work together on a document at similar times.” Philip Lacor, vice-president for the Emea region at file-sharing company Dropbox, says that globalisation and technology have redefined the world of work, shifting it away from traditional hierarchies. “Today, work is happening everywhere. Employees find themselves working on projects spread across multiple geographies, time zones, industries, and disciplines.” Collaboration, he adds, means that organisations are no longer constrained by geography. However, as with much technology, the changes created by new digital applications are not always predictable. Often it takes a while to realise what new software is best suited to. Mr Bowes says: “When these tools first appeared, they were seen as a way to save money. But they’re actually about finding ways of working that fit in with people’s lives.” Such shifts in practice can be far more profound than allowing staff to work from home or coffee shops and airports: “My business partner had to move to Australia,” says Mr Bowes. “We work together despite the 11 hour time difference.” At much larger companies, collaborative working is also taking over. Here the benefits often mitigate problems of size and bureaucracy. Jon Andrews, PwC’s head of technology and investment, says the professional services firm has recently implemented Google Drive “at a macro level”. He stresses that, although the technologies it brings are not necessarily new, the commitment to an integrated system that is available to everyone is new — and this has changed the way the company works. One of the biggest changes is that many tasks are now done on the fly. Documents, Mr Andrews says, are often edited in meetings. People travel less and use Google Hang-outs instead of meeting face-to-face. The company has also taken to crowdsourcing answers to questions and problems across its hundreds of thousands of staff in a way that is similar to the online Q&A platform Quora. “You see an ignition stage and then people join on to an idea and it evolves. The engagement is extraordinary and you get some really brilliant stuff.” Particularly in a large business such as PwC, he adds, collaborative systems can avoid duplication and boost efficiency. “You see a lot of people realising that someone else has already solved their problem,” says Mr Andrews. You see a lot of people realising that someone else has already solved their problem Jon Andrews, PwC’s head of technology and investment An improved technical framework for collaboration, though, is no guarantee of success. Beat Buhlmann, manager of Evernote for the Emea region, cautions that virtual teams can still fail for a number of reasons. These include cultural misunderstandings, poor communication, using the wrong channels and choosing the wrong people. He advises creating a solid foundation for collaboration. “Have a team charter and a code of conduct,” he advises. He also counsels that digital collaboration will never completely replace face-to-face contact. “If you look at trust-based tasks, building trust happens so much faster if you spend some time together.” Mr Buhlmann predicts that the next big things transforming working lives are likely to be artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. Some humans may see their working days transformed through applications such as instant transcription and the ability to search voice notes held in the cloud. Indeed, AI may even help pick teams. PwC is building an artificially intelligent system that will bring together the right people for collaborative tasks. Sample the FT’s top stories for a week You select the topic, we deliver the news.

"Google confirmed it had removed support from Google Maps but suggested that move might be temporary," technology website cnet.com reported on Tuesday. The removal was not mentioned in the release notes, and Google has not indicated whether it will reinstate support for watchOS. Amazon and eBay, both of which previously included Apple Watch support in their iOS apps have also removed their apps. Both were last updated in April. "It's unclear why the companies decided to remove support for their apps on the Apple Watch, or whether Apple had a role in their decision," the report noted. Apple launched its smartwatch two years ago, but the early software version was limited and apps initially were extensions of their iPhone apps. Apple released watchOS 3 software in 2016 that allowed app developers to make standalone apps for the Apple Watch.  TAGS Apple WatchGoogle MapsAmazoneBay O P E N Professional Courses Sponsored link Technology Courses Sponsored link Latest BJP MP Patel honey-trap: Woman arrested Two killed as tractor overturns in Bihar Canada defence minister sorry for exaggerating military role EC cancels Anantnag Lok Sabha bypoll Infosys plans to hire 10,000 American workers Hyderabad NGO rescues child labour victim Chinese Communist Party officials funding Dalai Lama: China's Global Times Aadhaar: SC to hear plea against govt decision Gallery May Day in pics: Protesters worldwide demand better work conditions, higher wages Deadly storms leave a trail of destruction in Texas arrow Videos How to make Prawns 65 Fuel prices to be revised daily from today arrow FOLLOW US Copyrights New Indian Express.2017 Dinamani | Kannada Prabha | Samakalika Malayalam | Malayalam Vaarika | Indulgexpress | Edex Live Contact Us | About Us | Careers | Privacy Policy | Search | Terms of Use | Advertise With Us Home | Nation | World | Cities | Business | Columns | Entertainment | Sport | Magazine | The Sunday Standard

Opinion: Even if you can, you probably shouldn't buy a Google Pixel anymore David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/05/01 2:09pm PDTMay 1, 2017 66 Plus 1 on G+ 263 Share on Facebook 60 Share on Twitter Total Shares389 Editorials Pixel Pixel XL The Google Pixel is a notoriously hard phone to get a hold of. Persistent stock issues have plagued Google's first "in-house" handset from day one, and things really are little to no better six months after the launch event. Honestly, it's a bit embarrassing just how consistently incompetent Google seems to be at keeping a reasonable inventory of phones available for purchase. But setting that aside, as one of the Pixel's most ardent evangelists, I think there's something it's probably time for me to come clean on: Even if you could buy a Pixel today, I really think you shouldn't. The Pixel is a product with generation-one product issues. The Bluetooth performance is horrid. It's not waterproof. The bezels really are due for a shrink. I don't think the exterior coating on the black and blue variants is of a particularly high quality. The glass window gets scuffed up incredibly easily. The Snapdragon 821 is officially old news. And it doesn't support proper advanced network features across all four of the big US carriers. There are other flaws I could point to, and while none of them are too terrible, they do speak to the slightly-rushed development cycle this phone seems to have been subjected to. Sure, Google got some things astoundingly right: the performance, the camera, the larger software experience. In fact, I think the Pixel is easily the best Android smartphone ever for these strengths, at least if we're talking about me personally as a user (your mileage, obviously, may vary). But for all the great, smooth, fast, clean, pure, simple, natural, and various other adjective-members singing in the Pixel-praise cavalcade, this phone is not the one to buy right now. For starters, Google continues to ask what is an increasingly laughable amount of money for the model most of us want - the 128GB XL - at a staggering $870. Sure, Apple charges the same for an iPhone 7 Plus 128GB, but I'm under no illusion that this comparison in any way favors Google. The iPhone comes with Apple customer service (with actual stores), a longer software support period going forward, and runs no real risk of poor resale value. The Pixel? Google's online support is iffy at best, we know the phone will be unsupported by October 2018, and I have a strong feeling generation-one Pixel resale values will drop like a rock once the new phones are announced. And that really is why, if you haven't pulled the trigger on a Pixel yet, you should just wait. It's overpriced, under-supported, and competing phones like the Galaxy S8 offer a whole lot more technology for your money. The Galaxy S8+ is $20 less than a 128GB Pixel XL, and I would argue it is far and away the better smartphone value. That amazing display, brand-new Snapdragon 835 processor, jaw-dropping design and packaging, and the full support of all our American carriers' latest LTE advancements could each be a reason on its own to put the Galaxy S8 above Google's smartphone. Do I still prefer using the Pixel over the S8? Sure. But I wouldn't buy a 128GB Pixel XL over a Galaxy S8+ today. That would be, frankly, a bit silly. If Google was asking $670 and not $870, the discussion would probably change, but they aren't. You've got to pay full price, and there's no way I could recommend anyone do that. If you're still on the fence about the Pixel, let me try to push you over: wait for the next generation. I realize that this sort of thinking can devolve into a rationale that encourages you to never upgrade anything because something newer, faster, and better is constantly on the horizon. But in this case, I think it's a consideration that is worth weighing more seriously than usual. Many of the Pixel's biggest flaws relate to Google's inexperience producing a smartphone. Issues that only come up as you try to mass-produce and distribute a product with a real marketing campaign that creates real demand, and the phone gets into the hands of "real" users who aren't part of the now-derailed Nexus phone hypetrain. Inside Google, expectations were no doubt managed, realities realized, and priorities accordingly re-calibrated after this first launch. (Side note: if the Bluetooth performance on the next Pixel is as bad as the first one, I may scream, Google.) Meanwhile, the things that make the Pixel great aren't going anywhere. The next Pixel will be fast, it will take great photos, and it will offer a wonderfully unfettered Android experience. Those that make it less than great? Google is no doubt drilling down through the worst of them in order to ensure the Pixel 2 - or whatever it's called - won't make the same mistakes that the original did (waterproofing, please). And one of the primary reasons to try the Pixel in the first place - to be on the very bleeding edge - really only remains true from a software standpoint. Older phones like the Nexus 5X and 6P don't even let the Pixel have an advantage there, as they're on the same update track until around the time the next Pixel phones launch. If you absolutely need a smartphone soon and the Pixel is tempting you, ask yourself this: Can you deal with a Moto G5 Plus for six months if it means having a better Pixel down the road? While as a reviewer I have the admitted luxury of not needing to consider such things, were I in such a position, I'd have little in the way of a counterargument to offer. Sure, you'll take a resale hit on anything you buy now, but the Pixel is going to face a much, much steeper devaluation curve in that time than any budget phone. Buying a Pixel right now just doesn't make sense. I love my Pixel XL, but I'm officially done recommending the phone to friends and relatives. Instead, I'll tell them to wait, or to get the Galaxy S8 they were probably going to buy anyway. Tags editorial google pixel google pixel xl opinion pixel xl subscribe ...

Google really shot themselves in the foot with availability. My name is…. No, they shot their foot with huge bezels, with lack of waterproof, lack of dual speakers, no real camera progress compared to nexii, meh battery life, meh screen. No real selling point besides being pure android phone. This phone had iphone price but was worst on so many levels (no A10 SoC, no iphone-fast NAND, no 4yrs updates) Oneplus on the other hand........ M. Luciano Also has none of that stuff, but is cheaper? My name is…. yes, half price cheaper. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ The black screen issue kind of negates anything else ;) Michael Hannigan What's the "black screen issue"? Carson Saldanha YOU WANT THE PIXEL TO HAVE THE A10 CHIP?? BHAAAAAAAHAHAHA My name is…. No, i want it to have a cheaper price, or be better somehwere else, like the Galaxy. STOP BEING RUDE Carson Saldanha https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CYF7C6hVAAAKF-_.jpg Tr3ple Shut up troll ,nobody likes you I see lmao My name is…. You know when you see the dumb guy, he always adds 'lol' or 'lmao' at the end of his sentence. And his syntax is always wrong. STFU and GTFO Liam Bulkley "You know when you see the dumb guy... And his syntax is always wrong." "You are an [sic] ignorant" Don't cut yourself on the glass. Michael Hannigan They have that - The Nexus 5x. Тарас Мукин You keep hating Pixel in the comments, but you only look at numbers. But they doesn't matter when it comes to Google. Software experience does. My name is…. That's a stupid argument Тарас Мукин And saying that somebody's argument is stupid without any explanation is a much smarter argument. My name is…. Would you pay 900$ bucks for Nexus 5 just because "Software experience matters"?? Carson Saldanha Nobody said they were paying just for the "software experience" Matt Tapac said that specs don't matter, the software experience does. That heavily implies that people are paying for the software experience. Carson Saldanha xD here we go again drunken_bastard Pixel and Pixel XL have better cameras and screens than any iPhone. The difference in SoC and other bits of hardware, they don't translate into any real world speed differences. Pixel also has great battery life. Perhaps some hands on time may do you some good. supersanborn Given that they continually sell out of the limited stock they have, none of what you cited matters. If they had a ginormous supply of units and THEN couldn't sell, then perhaps you would be on to something. My name is…. What was the availability in the first place? You think they produced many? No way Jose, i bet Galaxies and iphones outsold pixels by multiple times supersanborn We don't exactly know what they had hoped to produce or even what they actually produced, so your point remains conjecture. And who here is suggesting that Samsung and Apple phones didn't outsell the Pixel? My name is…. * by multiple times James Betti Sadly, Google isn't keeping the Pixel in stock because they don't care about their hardware line. Google makes most of its money through ads and personal data. It's a shame, but it explains why they discontinue successful products and barely have much in stock. Excellent phone by the way. Michael Hannigan Well, that's easy to rectify. Do like Amazon and offer the same exact hardware with "special offers" for a lower price. Then you get to see ads everywhere, even your home screen and app drawer. Pretty cool. Michael Hannigan Yes, they did. It was in the millions. Max "no real camera progress compared to nexii, meh battery life, meh screen." Ok, so you don't have a Pixel, we get it. My name is…. I'm not dumb, do you get that too? Xchris I think the consensus here is that you are talking bollocks. The pixel XL has an unbelievably good screen, one of the best battery life figures, still has the best camera out of any smartphone. Nobody who bought the pixel cares that much about any of your other points. In fact, what you are really saying is that you didn't like the pixel. Big deal! My name is…. Actually, i'm fighting the pixel in a nerdy community. Its expected that the consensus is that "i am talking bollocks". People here mainly wanna root their phones and put center clocks on status bar. they did the same with Nexii devices, its all about the software, but those phones were seriosly lacking (i used to own all Nexus devices after 4) Carson Saldanha So may I ask, what phone do you use now? My name is…. 1+3 Carson Saldanha Srsly!?!? Bruh, the OnePlus 3 has a Snapdragon 820 while the Pixel has a 821, a far better camera, better performance, and software. How is the OP3 better than the Pixel? Besides the price? I could probably understand if you had the OP3T, but no way. My name is…. You are an ignorant. 1) Check the speedtests, 1+3 is faster (because better nand) 2) Software is better on 1+3 (aosp with tiny mods) 3) Pixel has underclocked 821, thus 820 with a little bit of better battery life (1+3 has 1080p screen to tie this up) 4) 1+3 has 6gb ram (will be good for 4 years) 5) 1+3 is smaller than pixels, unbelievably thin 6) 1+3 has dash charging (world leading) 7) 1+3 has half the price 8) 1+3T is another story, far better Apply cream to the burn, son PS Yes Pixel has a better camera. Carson Saldanha Ignorance at it's finest. My name is…. Those are all FACTS, son. My name is…. Where are you, son? Jack Smith Have you ever even used a Pixel? Only Android phone i have used with zero touch lag. Can we also stop the name calling? Mason Andrew Maseda Hate to break it to you man. I own The One Plus 3T the Google Pixel the Nexus 6P and the Moto X pure edition. Lol. Guess witch one is my daily driver? The Pixel. Why? Better battery . Better cam. All around the most reliable phone. Even with my Nexus 6P I've had some issues here and there tiny ones. Like some days my battery life was abnormally shit and the next day it was great. The one plus 3T has tiny issues too. The Pixel is a phone that you wouldn't understand UNLESS YOU TRY ONE FOR A DAY. come back when you do. tansuperman Not sure why people think the pixel takes good pics. I have a pixel xl, 950xl, IPhone 7plus, and now the s8. In my opinion the pixel xl takes the worst pics. The lumia 950xl is stop dog. The pixel I can tell is just too overprocessed Michael Hannigan I think it applies mostly to low light pictures - absolutely nothing touches the Pixel in that respect - trust me. More generally, it applies to the software and hardware working together to create stunning (real) HDR pictures. But in low.light, which according to a friend of mine who is a smartphone camera freak (I am not), quality of low light pictures are what users are primarily interested in because he says "...any recent smartphone can take great pictures in daylight.". For me, I liked the flexibility of the V20 camera - not just the dual lenses, but the absolutely fantastic functions in the camera app. D13H4RD2L1V3 Um, the 821 consumes less power than the 820 at the lower clocks due to a more efficient binning process. Also, both the Pixel and OP3 use UFS 2 controllers. But on Nougat, the 3 uses F2FS for its filesystem. It's not a case of better NAND. It's a case of different filesystems. Michael Hannigan I think they should use FAT16. I miss it. Chris Rey I will say the Axon 7 is just as good as the OnePlus 3 and looks better. Suicide_Note The Pixel camera is definitely superior to what was in the 6P, and i say that as someone who currently owns them both. M. Luciano I use both on a daily basis. Agree with you 100%. So do objective measurements of the cameras. Pixel is the best on the market; 6P is decent but not great. andy_o On paper both cameras should be just short of identical, but the Pixel is so much faster in processing cause of the HVX dedicated core, plus the N6P throttles like crazy (in one of my photospheres tests in a warm room the Nexus 6 beat it every time). This is crucial especially with Google who is prioritizing computational photography probably on par or more with hardware camera specs. Also, I'm not sure if this is a hardware or artificial limitation, but HDR+ auto has completely different behavior on the Pixels. I can understand how someone who has only looked at the specs and not used a Pixel and N6P (especially in the summertime), can think that there's been "no real camera progress", but this guy is balls-deep in the "arrogance of ignorance". Michael Hannigan I think the reason for the difference in HDR+ in the Pixel is that it's" real HDR - it takes several pictures and then layers them. Other phones have taken a shortcut do doing that with one picture and it really doesn't achieve the same. Except in one case - manually setting HDR in my Note 7 gave absolutely stunning night time photos. Something I can't quite achieve with the built in software on the Pixel (but can with Photoshop). andy_o I was talking the difference between HDR+ auto in the Pixel and HDR+ auto in the previous phones. The auto behavior in the Pixel is different, but the HDR+ processing is basically the same. There's more info here: http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/11/21/deep-dive-closer-look-google-pixels-camera/#What_does_HDR_do If you feel nerdy enough I can link you to a paper on HDR+ by the Google computational photography team too :) Regarding the other phone cameras, the reason they do worse isn't exactly that they they're taking shortcuts, it's actually because they're doing it the traditional way, taking different exposures. Read the AP article linked above for details on how HDR+ is fundamentally different. Michael Hannigan You have OLED burn-in? I have about 8 hours SOT/day and don't have any. That would piss me off. Jason B Inverting colors for a bit while doing some extended reading helps. Black background with white text is easier on the eyes too. But yeah, static nav bar and notification area aren't great for OLED. There should be auto pixel shift to prevent it ... or Google should make more use of Immersive Mode. whispy_snippet Ugh. Like a broken fucking record here sometimes. Shawn Spring While some of your other points may/may not be valid, to say that the Pixel had "no real camera progress compared to nexii" just makes you sound ignorant. The S821 ISP alone would make the camera in the Pixel superior, not to mention the updated HDR algorithms. Get a Pixel owner and a 6P owner in the same room (I was both) and ask them to shoot with each others phone and see who prefers which. The 6P camera lag in HDR mode was inefficient at best and unbearable at worst. And it wasn't that long ago that OnePlus was using a broken invite system, had people lick their phones, and had a horribly gender insensitive marketing campaign. I'd probably not hold them up as the standard bearer against Google. Michael Hannigan They had people lick their phones? Why did they never ask me to do that? That's discrimination. I should have been asked to lick my phone. Brett Lewis I love my pixel after coming from a HTC 8x on Windows platform. Never liked Apple and never will. And lately after all the talk of Samsung's products (blowing up, red screens, other problems) I'm quite happy with my pixel. I don't need water proofing I'm not an idiot that takes my phone near water.. the I hardly notice the bezels after coming from a 4.3 inch 720 display.. The htc8x had one of the widest angle front cameras but I dont take selfies. This pixel does what I want and is fast doing it. And for first time experiencing Android I'm quite happy with buying this with the newest and best version available. TheHater So only idiots take their phones near water? I bet if you had a water resistant phone, you'd take it near water. Michael Hannigan What about the toilet? Who doesn't read the news when sitting on the shitter? Mariano Moreira I would definitely agree in terms of the Pixel XL vs iPhone 7 plus comparisons (Non-32GB model) Comparing the base iPhone 7 vs base Pixel...the iPhone 7 base had(has) slow Nand performance from what I have witnessed. The 32GB iPhone 7 vs base 32GB Pixel (5") seems like a closer comparison where the compromise is better battery life on the Pixel, faster Nand, and better screen. Again, I concur that looking at the Pixel XL vs iPhone 7 Plus leans more heavily towards Apple especially when comparing the 128GB models. Michael Hannigan If you buy from the Google store, they are carrier agnostic - absolutely 0 carrier bloatware. Mariano Moreira No. I have a Google Play(Bootloader unlocked) purchased Pixel. Normally used on Sprint or At&t. When I activate on Verizon: to get Vo-LTE calling with Verizon SIM and certain carrier settings it does a software update switching the phone over to the Verizon specific software build. If it was truly Carrier-agnostic it wouldn't force a Carrier specific Software build onto my non-Verizon model Pixel. Michael Hannigan You must have either bought it from Verizon or screwed something up. An unlocked phone doesn't suddenly become carrier specific like you describe Mike John Quincy Adams I don't one person who owns or says ’I sure wish I had a OnePlus.' Michael Hannigan I have - when I had the OnePlus One. Many people asked me about it. You can't deny that OnePlus phones offer an unbeatable value. They don't skimp on specs and sell for half the.price they should. asrat_24 I get you're trying to make fun of that guy but don't make ignorant statements while trying to do it. Oneplus makes good phones and people are interested enough nowadays to say that. Major Sceptic Agree on all points , a mid range device with a flagship price , perhaps Google will adjust the prices on the 2 ? for a company trying to expand it's phone sales it's going a funny way about it . Artem Russakovskii Well, usually at that point you start seeing significant discounts, but the Pixel is a misnomer in that regard to due to low stock and high demand. Max Exactly, I would revise that affirmation to state: "I've always felt once we are less than 6 months from the new iteration, it's a mistake to buy the existing product *at full price*." supersanborn I'll grant there's a case to be made for some phones where waiting can result in substantial discounts (especially from HTC/LG/etc). Probably a little of my bias sneaks in here. I prefer to have the newer device, and if I waited 6 months post-launch, it probably means I myself need to wait until the next launch. Max I'm with you there, I usually buy a phone at launch or a couple of months later at most but remember that we aren't regular customers, that's why we read and comment on this site ;). For many people out there it makes more sense to buy a phone six months after release if it comes with a nice worthy discount. M. Luciano This ^^ supersanborn Agreed, for some, shaving $100-200 off the price is all that matters. I usually caution folk pretty hard in the last 3 months before the new iteration drops if they have any form of new feature/size/color envy. supersanborn And yeah, I'm nowhere near the "normal" consumer :-) needa Supposed to be picking up a 32gb XL (Google) for $450 near mint in a couple hours. I might not get it, but a killer deal nonetheless. M. Luciano Smash that deal :) Very nice. needa A few little scratches on the back glass. Profit.

The lowest I've seen on Swappa was $695 for a black XL. supersanborn True. I usually find that the discounts are kind of on the "meh" side though until we hit release of new product. I always basically tell folks that you either buy it at launch until about 6ish months post-launch, and if you've held off that long, you should just wait until next launch and either buy the old product at a big discount or buy the new one. Matt I believe your use of misnomer was a bit of a misnomer. Artem Russakovskii I did use the wrong word, you're right. el_smurfo That's why I just picked up a 6p last year for $400. Most expensive smartphone I've ever bought, but the full release price was just not in my budget. Karly Johnston Battery issues? MisterAlex Maybe an anomaly... but not a misnomer. paxmos Where is this high demand you guys talk about?, I have yet to see a pixel in anyone's hand M. Luciano Really? I know over a dozen people who have or had them. paxmos Yep...I see lots of iPhones and Sammy's, even one Blackberry Z30, have only seen a pixel in the Verizon store. M. Luciano I feel like a nerd owning 4 Major Sceptic It does seem to have more of an enthusiast following , no shortage of pixels in my region , the usual brands , apple, Samsung, still seem to have the sales , I know not one person that has a pixel or wants one , and I think Google only has itself to blame on that front, Re : the cost of a pixels . Goblin Shark Finally, someone who knows what they're taking about - my head is just shaking in disbelief reading what these marshmallow brains that think they know about phones are saying on this comment thread lol Daishi Exactly. I have yet to see a Pixel in the wild. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ To be fair, HTC isn't used to such a high demand for their phones. Google unfortunately paid the price Daishi This made me LOL! A post full of WIN for sure!! Zoglog Actually it's probably because of all the RMA's they've gotten JD Thought that was obvious. syxbit I wonder whether we shouldn't wait for Pixel + 2. The next Pixel may technically be the first Google made product (current Pixel is made by HTC), so it's possible the Pixel 2 will have first gen problems. Still, I still have the N6P (after I scoffed at the Pixel price and refused to buy it), so I going to be looking for a phone soon. Good_Ole_Pinocchio HTC is also manufacturing the Pixel 2. Word on the street. Daishi That's too bad. I'll avoid this this phone as well... Captain On! Well, technically the iPhone is made by Foxconn, so... Don't expect Google to actually build their own facilities to produce hardware. Carson Saldanha Pretty sure they'll still be using HTC. Might have more control over the design this time around though. 4Ui812 The availability issue is a play out Nintendo's handbook. Good_Ole_Pinocchio 100% agree with the entire article... Do I want the Pixel Software Experience and Camera? Yes... But not when the new version is a few months away thag would probably fix all the issues I see posted on this site ever so often...starting with the Bluetooth issues. I got an S8... Because it's the only phone thay makes sense to me right now..... I'll see what Google is doing in the fall Max Johnson If the Moto G5 Plus had NFC I would have no problem making it my Android daily driver for the next 6 months. wade_county Moto Z Play and OP3/OP3T are other options with NFC. shadowx360 I used to buy 1 generation old Nexus devices to get around the cost issue, but it seems the 5X and 6P both are plagued by serious phone-killing issues. Now that warranty is up on nearly every used 5X/6P, buying used is like trying to navigate a minefield. I don't really trust 1st generation Pixel to not have serious issues either. I'd never use a non-Pixel/Nexus device but I can't buy a Pixel XL knowing Samsung offers so much better hardware at a similar price. wade_county My advice is getting the next OnePlus phone or picking up a used OP3/OP3T. AndrewGM I bought a used Pixel in good shape on eBay, as I couldn't get one from Google Store (already had a wireless provider). Switched from an iPhone 6s, after using almost every iPhone model since and including the original. Much better camera on the Pixel, especially closeups and in low light, and much easier to use overall (especially Contacts vs. iOS), as I've used mostly Google apps for a long time. I like the Google keyboard much better and the Android interface. I'm definitely satisfied with the Pixel and have no real iPhone regrets. It's true there are more apps for the iPhone, but that doesn't matter because the core apps are available on Android too. The only app I miss is Enlight, for photo editing. The one Pixel issue I agree with is the relatively poor resale value vs. iPhones (I assume). Carson Saldanha May I suggest Snapseed for photo editing? (It's developed by Google) Also, do you miss iMessage/FaceTime or is that really a con? AndrewGM Will check out Snapseed, thanks. I've been using Google Photos to lightly edit pics. The Pixel camera is so good that I often don't edit (for Instagram/FB uploads), especially if the light and composition are already good. I don't miss iMessage at all. I had to turn it off and all that stuff for my phone number when I switched, but I'm texting away every day. Emoticons seem to work fine. I don't even think about iMessage. FaceTime has been replaced with Duo for my family members, including those on iPhone. Seems to work fine. And I can share location with family members via Google Maps. I guess that brings up privacy issues vs. using Apple products, but not sure it makes a real-world difference. Battery life, btw, seems pretty good (I charge the phone overnight only). The call quality is a little less than iPhone, maybe, but overall acceptable. AndrewGM Will add that I have had the Pixel for 2 months and use it daily. I like the screen on the Pixel (or at least it never bothers me), and the issue about the "chin" at the bottom being big is a non-issue to me. I don't notice it and in fact hold the phone sometimes there, which is arguably convenient. If the phone continues to hold up, I'll be a customer for Pixel 2 eventually. Eric I was ready to jump to the Pixel XL after returning my second Note 7, but Google never gave me the opportunity to give them my money. Carson Saldanha xD My name is…. It was never a good device. thank you for finally admitting that. Andrew I don't think that's what the author is saying... My name is…. Someone had to be crazy to buy a pixel in the first place. I was bashing on that device from day one. Author, months later, says that the phone is no good. It was never good. Carson Saldanha Lord, would you just chill? Tr3ple I think he's retarded, gotta be it, lol. Must be it actually. Carson Saldanha troll by far Suicide_Note Except that's not at all what the author said, so you're either: A) trolling, B) incredibly dumb, or C) both of the above. Тарас Мукин Of course there's no point in buying Pixel for full price now. And there's more: there's no point in buying any device for it's starting price when it's 3 months old — tech gets old really fast today. And that's the whole point of not buying something at day one — everything gets much cheaper very fast. Samsungs do, LGs too. But Pixel for some reason didn't. And Nexuses were like this too. So — only buying Google devices right after release makes sense. Or buying them unofficially and cheaper. Sad, but true. sraj49 I always like and respect your articles. You put your views straight forward. But I tend not to agree with the tone and content of this article completely. I am living in Home of full Apple products and I own a Pixel XL. I love the Pixel in all aspects. Yes there are room to improvements which is true for everyone. Apple products are well designed, well built. As regards sorry gone are those days when Apple sorry was at is best which was until iPhone 4s/ iPhone 5. Now after the warmth period it is the same as Pixel. I going Pixel after sales support very good. I definitely agree with you on the most inefficient handling of supplies and also this is not the time to buy since meet models are coming. Just to add, I get sick when people say that the Pixel phones are not made by Google but by HTC. Everyone outsources manufacturing. Most of the phone are made by Foxcon staying from Apple. All phone manufacturers only design the hardware, software and the manufacturing is outsourced. Good_Ole_Pinocchio The HTC point that keeps coming up comes from the fact that Google didn't really dsign much hardware hete. They just used HTC parts. It's not the same as hardware being designed by apple then manufactureres elsewhere. andy_o I think he's right on that point. Google support may or may not be good, but it's online only. Apple support is famously good. For instance, the recent fixes for iPhone 6s battery problems. I booked an appointment, went into the store, they told me it would be a bit, went to a coffee shop, they emailed me, picked it up. Another time my iPad mini 2 mute switch broke. Again, appointment, go in the store, got it actually just exchanged on the spot. Google simply cannot do that. JohnyNoLegs What android phones have you owned prior to the pixel? And yes it's a HTC phone through and through. Scofabear Shots fired! I even dumped my 6P for a Moto z play. No regrets Futbolrunner Same here! That 808 was a lag fest. I even got the S8+ but returning it because it can't touch the Play's battery life. Dominic D I just bought a Pixel a month ago. I still would recommend it if you get one for fairly cheaply on swappa. It's awesome. Brian Demodulated My last 3 phones have been Nexus. Each has been less reliable than the last. I love how hackable they are but I think my next phone will be a Samsung Galaxy. Carson Saldanha Elaborate? Wdym by "less reliable" What issues? Brian Demodulated My Samsung Galaxy Nexus was incredible and still works today. My Nexus 5 was garbage - two broke within 1.5 years. My 6P is quirky - it doesn't charge on my home PC and although my wife's updated to 7.1.2 mine says it's up to date at 7.1.1. Tr3ple Get a pixel then, Samsung lol. Brian Demodulated I have my 6P another year. I'll see what's available next year when my contract is up. JohnyNoLegs Bootloops, dodgy updates, requires factory resets, breaks features, slow bug fixes. M. Luciano No offense, but you are not going to increase stability by going to Samsung. Brian Demodulated My old Samsung Galaxy Nexus was the best, highest quality, most reliable phone I ever owned. LG and Huawei's Nexus phones were less stable for me. M. Luciano I had a few of those.. they weren't as reliable. But probably because I did bad things to them. Brian Demodulated I rooted mine, loaded hacky ROMs, and carried it with me everywhere I went for 3 years. The USB and audio cables are a little loose now but otherwise it's saved me when my later Nexus phones crapped out on me. Vitali Galaxy nexus had clean stock rom, it is just Google's clean soft in a Samsung physical device and not with samsung's os Brian Demodulated Every Nexus has the clean stock ROM. It's one of the top reasons why I get them. JohnyNoLegs Going Pixel sure doesn't increase stability. It's less stable than my Note 4/Note 7. Vitali Agree with M. Luciano, but people try should move to Sony. Lookup at speed test videos of their Xperia XZs, it has beaten all smartphones by now, including the Pixel. All the biased big reviewers out there will never tell you the truth, stop thinking the S8 is the best phone in the world.. I recommend you to wait for their Xperia XZ Premium it will have sd835! After you see the XZs speed, I promise you it may be the fastest phone even in 2018. Suicide_Note No. Just...no. Vitali *A wild 8 year old fanboy comment appears* Brian Demodulated Speed isn't that important to me. I've heard bad things about Sony's flavour of Android and that it's bloaty. Vitali So you heard wrong, their software is one of the bests out there, and im talking from experience.. And Samsung have so clean and fast Android that it is just unbelievable.. Where do you get all that info from?? Vitali So you heard wrong, their software is one of the bests out there, and im talking from experience.. And Samsung have so clean and fast Android that it is just unbelievable.. "I've heard.." Where do you get all that info from?? Suicide_Note TW is much better than it used to be, but it's hardly clean and fast. Brian Demodulated I work in a large IT department. One of my buddies told me about it. He said Sony's Android UI was all over the place and annoying to use, and that his handset was 2 major versions behind the latest version of Android OS. dtox Lol don't listen to him, xperia phones are absolute trash. dtox LOL xperia = garbage D13H4RD2L1V3 Um, I'm not entirely sure. Not that I'm ragging Sony, but they haven't exactly been selling for a reason. Even Sony themselves know. I don't hate Sony phones. I personally think they're understated, solid offerings. Problem was that they were really overpriced. After seeing the XZs and XA1, seems like their pricing may have become more logical. We'll see how it goes. I'm personally hoping the XZP may even be a solid device. Not that I'll buy one but if the price is right, it'll be significantly easier to recommend. JSo Experiences differ from person to person. But It's odd the luck you have had with the Nexus devices. I've had the Galaxy Nexus, Nexus 5 and now the Nexus 5X and I have never had an issue with any of them. JohnyNoLegs No battery issues with 5X? My wifes upgraded to 7.1.1 and has never been the same, bluetooth is slow and laggy, and the battery barely gets 1.5-2 hours SOT after it used to get close to 3. Michael Hannigan Dude, you're talking about a crusty old obsolete phone. And unless you are happy getting 2 hours of battery time, you should pry the wallet open and buy something current. Complaining about your old phone won't make you feel better. Replacing it with a working, current phone that's not past it's expected useful life will. JohnyNoLegs Dude, wth are you talking about. It's a 1.5 years old. From new it was getting 4-5, right up until 7.1.1 update. Roy My 6P is the most reliable phone ever. And I had Samsung and HTC. Duder12 The last Nexus phones had bum processors from qc. royrov My Nexus 6P kissed the asphalt a couple of weeks ago, so I bought a perfect Pixel XL second hand (used 3-4 months). Its better, no regrets here. Faster and better battery, hell even snapchat is snappy on it! Tr3ple Exaclty lol, people saying the pixel isn't an upgrade to the 6p are delusional lol. They all like to hate on it u til they get one and realize how good of a phone it is. And all the bugs I've been seeing on the net are nowhere to be found and I had mine for 5-6 months now bekifft I know it's an upgrade. It's just not much of an upgrade for an enormous amount of money. Tr3ple My 6p had serious issues, I went and got a s7 egde(big mistake), the price I paid was well worth it. I'm still financing my s7 egde while I'm using a pixel, this is how much I love this phone. destinyhud I will still buy one Michael Tran If I could give you a phone for free but you had to keep it and use it and couldn't sell it. Which phone would it be? M. Luciano 128 GB Pixel XL, black supersanborn My 128GB Pixel XL in black. At least until the 2 comes and **hopefully** adds waterproofing, 600Mhz support, 4x4MIMO for T-Mobile. If you're reading, Pixel team, let's talk! Orlando aka Pixel XL Samsung Galaxy S8+ blue Tr3ple Gimme a 128 gb pixel XL black any day keithzg The bezels really are due for a shrink. Boy are you gonna rue this when the second-gen comes out and the bezels are the exact same ;) M. Luciano I sorta hope they are :) keithzg You animal! (But honestly, this is why choice is good. I find the desire for those top and bottom bezels incomprehensible, but I can entirely understand that not everyone would feel the way I do, particularly if routinely holding phones very differently.) M. Luciano I just want SOME bezels. They don't need to be huge. Just want a place to put my thumbs when holding it sideways. It's a good place for speakers IMO. Carson Saldanha Nah, to be fair, I think Google's definitely not planning on keeping them the same size if they've listened to the reviews. keithzg I mean, if they'd listened to reviews of many other phones before they put out the Pixels they would have known that too---including, for instance, the previous two generations of Nexus phones . . . So it seems likely that either (a) they know of the opinions of the commentariat and disagree, or (b) they felt technically they couldn't do it. I'm personally hoping it was somehow just (b) but they used (a) to convince themselves that it was an okay sacrifice, but that they won't have to make the same sacrifice again this year and they'll allow themselves to change up the design. But I'm not gonna bet too much money on that. Carson Saldanha Whoa, you lost be there with all those "a's" and "b's" xD Shawn Spring I think its pretty well known at this point that the time frame between when Google's negotiations w/Huawei fell through and when they picked the deal up with HTC was the cause of the "let's use the leftover A9 shells" bezel issue. So more (b) than (a) assuredly. ikeofkc If they do. Peoples' thumb muscles are going to be screwed if they use the pixel 1 handed, constantly trying to reach the back button. The chin makes one handed use possible keithzg See, that's what I mean about different folks and different strokes. I've never noticed it being of any help with my Nexus 6P, for me the top and bottom bezels are completely useless. bekifft If they actually put something useful there, like a front facing stereo speaker, I would be totally fine with that. keithzg Dammit, don't you go making me miss the Nexus 6 again! Michael Hannigan I want them to be bigger. I want to be able to lean on mine when I am standing in line at a movie. MadMartigan I am constantly amazed by the short memories. The author thinks it likely they are likely to have a better launch of P2? They do give the obvious impression that they believe the Pixel to be their first swing and a miss... Funny how quickly we forget, well, nearly every other device Google has ever tried to sell. I personally loved my 4, 10, 5, 6, and 6. But I cannot, while keeping a straight face, argue that one should expect anything better from them regarding inventory management this time around. How many times does Google have to fail on inventory management before we start pointing and laughing at the people who constantly say, "They'll get it right this time, for sure." Don't get me wrong - I would absolutely love it if Google proved me wrong on the P2. I just won't believe it until I see it. //dons flameproof suit// A'ight, I'm ready. Fire away... M. Luciano This is their first swing and a miss, but only because the shortages are for very different reasons than prior devices they sold on behalf of other OEM's. MadMartigan Who...who do you think made the Pixels? M. Luciano Google is the OEM for the Pixel phones (and tablets, and laptops, etc). HTC is the factory putting the phones together. It's a totally different legal and business agreement, and essentially means that Google has to supply most of the components, contracts, contacts, etc. and HTC is essentially an assembly line. On Nexus phones, the OEM was Samsung, or LG or Huawei, etc. and they actually designed and produced the phones, in partnership with and input from Google. Completely different. For those, the partner was able to do all the contracting and sourcing; HTC isn't doing all the work for Google this time. MadMartigan So you don't believe HTC designed the Pixel. Got it. That's all I needed to see. M. Luciano Not sure what that means, but ok. Google is now the OEM, that's what I am saying. Another Scott Nice post. I hemmed and hawed about a Pixel XL 128 for 6 weeks last fall and finally decided I just couldn't do it. Besides the fact that it was impossible to get from Google, I just couldn't justify the price. I decided to finally replace my LG Nexus 4 (roughly $350 new) with a new T-Mobile LG V10 from B&H in November for $330 and am quite pleased. (It would have been $300 a week or so later.) I added a Samsung EVO 128 GB SDHC card for it for $40 or so. I miss the Nexus timely updates a great deal, but I can't see spending a kilobuck on a phone to get it - especially for only a 2 year OS upgrade availability. I hope Google gets the Pixel 2 right, but maybe they figure having a "premium" phone for evangelists is good enough so they won't feel any pressure to make it available (or cut the price). Cheers, Scott. fijisiv The Galaxy S8+ is $20 less than a 128GB Pixel XL Just wow. M. Luciano Right? The Pixel is by far a better value at those prices. 128 GB storage over 16, metal over glass body, better software, better security, better camera, guaranteed to be up to date for 3 years... Samsung has some great components, but as a package, Pixel seems to keep ahead at this point. Matt I believe the S8+ is 64G and has a microSD slot. M. Luciano I think you're right. IMO that makes the Pixel better. Do you prefer less with expandable option? 03grunt I live in the mountains of NC and went back to Verizon once they brought back unlimited data and luckily the local Verizon store had a Pixel XL. I think it's pretty sad that in ~ 18 months the Pixel will be EOL. M. Luciano Luckily, it won't be. Nexus and Pixel devices are guaranteed to be fully up to date for 3 years; not 2. 2 years of major updates and 3 years of security updates = 3 years of being fully up to date. Sir_Brizz That's not entirely true. They are only guaranteed to be on the latest version for 2 years. It's unlikely it will be any different than the Nexus 6 in this regard (which didn't get 7.1 but is still getting monthly security updates). M. Luciano The Pixel and Pixel XL released October 4, 2016. They're guaranteed to be fully up to date until 10/31/2019. That's 1121 days, or 3.07 years. Sir_Brizz No. You are wrong. They are only guaranteed version updates until October 2018. The Nexus 6 was guaranteed the same thing until October 2016. It did not get Android 7.1 even though it continues to get monthly security updates. What this means is that the Pixel will get at least Android 9.0 but that doesn't guarantee it will get 9.1 or 9.2 or anything else past that. It just means it will get 9.0 and monthly security updates to 9.0 for an additional year. M. Luciano I get what you're saying, but it also launches on the latest update. So using the Pixel, it launches with N, will get O after a year, will get P after a year and then is not guaranteed to get Q. Are we really going to get a Q? So during each of those three updates, N, O and P, it on the latest OS and getting monthly security updates. 2 years of updates, so long as it includes the 2nd major OS update, translates to three full years. Ever since they started the annual number and letter update, we're essentially talking about a single API version update per year (2016 had 2, including the one you're referencing which impacted Shamu). Sir_Brizz I've already pointed this out twice: look at the Nexus 6 for a first hand example of how this is going to work. The Nexus 6 will not be on the latest version of Android for three years because it is already not on the latest version of Android despite getting monthly security updates. 03grunt Thanks for clarifying! Chris Kiederer As a Nexus 5X/project Fi user, right now the Pixel is my only choice if my Nexus decides to blow up like many before it. I really hope this Android one rumor heading to the US is true, as it would give project Fi subscribers more than just a really expensive option to stay on the plan Andye82 But exactly one year from today it will be still extremely difficult if not impossible to get your hands on pixel 2 Mix "Persistent stock issues have plagued Google's first "in-house" handset from day one..." I am on my 3rd phone and I still wonder, every time I use it, if it will be like my last two phones. I have phone PTSD! Google should just pull a Nintendo and just stop producing and move on to the 2 but not fuck it up. John Doe Great job on the article, now I will be waiting for the editorial on Google's software update policy LoL PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Google's inexperience producing a smartphone They had great experience running Motorola. Ammar "Sure, Google got some things astoundingly right: the performance, the camera, the larger software experience" To be honest, these are the only reasons why I'd ever get a Pixel over any other Android phone. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ I agree with some of Radar's points as well as teh main one as I've *never* recommended the XL because I know that the vast majority of people are sheep-like followers and/or technophobes, and I defifnitely don't want part of the onus for a technophobe's major purchase that they're going to rue the second that an iPhoner mocks them. The Pixel sells itself to PowerUsers on its own merit, which, AEB the popularity of inferior and/or questionable top-sellers, clearly supports my previous assertions. JPLoureiro Deciphering of your sentences will commence............. now. Futbolrunner What? Marty I never was going to buy an HTC Pixel. Don't like HTC and the build quality doesn't deserve such a high price. jawsnnn My SOs Pixel is probably the buggiest Google phone I have used till date. The Google Assistant, voice search are consistently broken and the phone doesn't offer much else in way of justifying it's price. Will definitely buy an OEM phone next. Google's hardware experiment is dead for me. Tim Harman I wish I'd read this 2 weeks ago! Oh well. I've got a Pixel now and I do love it. I live in NZ and the version I ended up with is the American one, which means that while it supports all my LTE bands, it doesn't support Carrier Aggregation on the bands used here. So that's my excuse for why I simply MUST HAVE the P2 when it's released. Damian Stuart Wow, what a load of crap! The Pixel is a superb phone with issues affecting small numbers of devices. I have one, after moving away from the Samsung range. I have had no issues and as I don't ever intend to take a phone swimming haven't got a single complaint about it. But haters gonna hate. sebastianer @David Ruddock Don't forget the terrible compass. If you grab an iPhone 5S and a Pixel. Open Google Maps in both of them. An you start walking trough dense downtowns the whole day (closing / opening maps at different places). You will see that the Pixel compass accuracy is constantly changing every time you open maps and is a total mess while the 5S is perfectly accurate after 1-2 seconds and less than one step. I hope the next Pixel has a completely new sensor...or compass or whatever. Last 3-4 Google Phones were a mess. I think the last Google phone with more or less good compass was the galaxy nexus but I can't even remember now TechGuy22 i'm selling mine soon since i know i can sell it around 600 dollars and it's the 128GB wjrandon So glad I kept my Nexus 6P for a second year... and look at those rock solid resale values. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9d5926ba5094521287d1d54e2476d3852462178bdf74a16166f94742b435213c.jpg TechGuy22 i sold mine for 500 dollars and i bought it used too lol that's how i managed to get the XL 128GB eric messenger It depends on what phone your coming from. For most android users it is a great phone with a great camera. If your coming from an iPhone the pixel is the first great alternative to an iphone. The on device support is actually awesome and they are very quick with support issues. I am used to Nexus devices plagued with serious issues that you had to work around and while they were great phones for the price I felt they all suffered (maybe not the 6P). Anyway the point is pixel raised the bar for Android and brought it up to par with Apple. It's probably still worth buying if you have to upgrade, and you can just get the pixel 3 in 2019 or 2020. Sean You can say this about any phone at the moment....wait for next gen. As a Project Fi user I am waiting on a phone that has the cell radio to take advantage of T-mobile's new 600mhz band they are quickly rolling out...and NO, it cant be done with a software update on any phone. me me "quickly rolling out"? The spectrum is sold but not available yet as the current user vacates.... Sean NOT TRUE....they are rolling it out in areas NOW where the old TV stations have already vacated the band. Google is your friend. me me finally, you realize it was crap, was always, still now, only thing now is you changed. Never worth the money, specs so-so for the price. Islam Google Pixel poor use of space. over-priced. BS Sean People that actually OWN one dont agree........ TechGuy22 i agree and i have one. sadly, it just stopped caring about the bezel since there's nothing i can do to make it look better VAVAMk_2 6P user here with a new battery happily waiting it out for Pixel 2. Sean Boot loop much? Ernie I have had my Nexus 6p since day one of the release. I have been lucky not to have encountered the boot loop or battery problems others have reported. I love my Nexus 6p. Hope it will get Android O. Phone_Addiction Pixel 2 probably going be the same story. Google will never learn. Dean F Marsh I love my Pixel XL! Invest in a good quality case and enjoy the phone. It's really pretty decent and for a few minor quirks mentioned, and none that I have experience yet, I can't be happier. From Nexus, HTC, Samsung, to Pixel XL, this has been the best so far. Ailín Ó’S I live in Ireland and Pixel isn't even available here yet which is odd given we were a launch country for Nexus 5x/6p but hey ho. Rick Schoonmaker This is just what I like to read after getting banged by Google and Huawei with the 6P bootloop issue 1 year and 2 days (read 2 days out of warranty) after buying and being told that my only option is to buy a new phone. So after being without a phone for a week, I had to buy a Pixel XL even though I really didn't want it and especially at the ridiculous price ($860 for 32Gb.. are you effing kidding?). Matt Definitely. I got a pixel XL the very first morning when it was available in local store. Great phone, camera, software. 2 months later, the phone began to behave crazily--extra hot, microphone malfunction. Called Google support for like 10 times and had it replaced, then I put the brand new replacement on local trade platform without hesitation. Google-brand is attatractive, but does not worth that rediculous amount of money. I can get a even better performed oneplus counterpart for almost half price. Anyway, I am on my moto x 2014 with lineage os 14 and i am pretty happy. It is sufficient for me to deal with my daily work. And I also suggest to wait for the release of more flagships from variant companies to have more flexible and reasonable options. Spinkick Google seems to not be able to follow through on anything these days. It just seems like if its not sexy or cool and needs actual work, they cant be bothered. Maybe they will release another chat app in the meantime.. 2 Men-E I want the Pixel 2 XXL (Taimen). It better exist as a 5.6"+ screened device. Philip Although if you're with TMobile. It's significantly cheaper to buy the Pixel, and get your money's worth. Granted the Pixel is guaranteed two years of support, it matches with TMobile promotion pay credit time. h4rr4r They offer a discount? I thought it was just financing. Philip Yep. $325 in TMobile bill credits over two years. Which is when the Pixel 3 will be out. So you buy a Pixel, get refunded about half of the cost. And then you're ready to upgrade to the third generation. belac77 shhh, David, I just listed my Pixel for sale on Swappa! ;) Mason Andrew Maseda This entire article is just terrible and written by someone just mad they don't have one. M. Luciano lol he got one the week after I did. He's had one. Adrianus Bratanata Supply and demand. As long as there is bigger demand than supply they don't need to reduce the price drunken_bastard I disagree. All the pros you mentioned for the Pixel -- pure Android experience, performence, camera, etc -- those are all the reasons why the Pixel and Pixel XL is still the best smartphone on the market. Worried a new one is going to come out? Happens with every flagship, every year. This one doesn't have the lastest SoC? I challenge you to demonstrate real world differences in actual speed versus the Galaxy S8, which is a gorgeous handset that yet again is crippled by bloated software and long standing issues that never seem to get addressed. You cite support potentially ending in October 2018 for software updates, but that's still a longer window than any other Android flagship, and you get them day one, which Samsung and LG don't. A smartphone is more than the sum of it's parts. It's an experience. I feel on that quality alone, the Pixel and Pixel XL are the best representations to date. NeMoDoSeZ I was going to buy a 128gb Pixel XL but due to not being available I ended up waiting and purchasing a Galaxy S8+. I'm now glad things ended up the way they did because I'm loving my S8+. Rod Until Android 8 is released. Then you'll like: fuck Samsung man! My U$xxx phone is outdated, goddamnit! Owen Iverson I hate the world of tech. We've now gotten used to NEEDING the latest thing IMMEDIATELY. Its why companies like Microsoft, Adobe, and Autodesk have switched to monthly/yearly subscriptions so you have to pay for the rest of your life. "The Bluetooth performance is horrid." What metric, speed? Connectivity? "It's not waterproof." Not sure that waterproof is a common trait among all high-end phones just yet. "The bezels really are due for a shrink." I've never used a bezel-less phone, where do you pick it up or hold it? Does your finger trigger anything on the edges? "The Snapdragon 821 is officially old news." What are you running where 1) you see lag and 2) that it's an actual problem. Maybe people are replacing consoles with their phones just like they're replacing their DSLRs with their phones? "it doesn't support proper advanced network features across all four of the big US carriers." What are these advanced network features? Anyway, I know it's a phone blog, so ... D13H4RD2L1V3 Well, he means that since its successor isn't far off, and that the Pixel is still not easy to get hold of, you might be better off waiting, since the Pixel is also selling at full price still. Edward jh How can the camera be great I mean what about the pixel camera lens flare issue plaguing 1000's of users. Margaritas Ante Porcos Pixel was a disaster. The worst phone for that price. I understand some of you got the Stockholm syndrome. But some of us see the clear picture. Google simply lost this round with both hands down. Dan Yurman My Google Pixel seems to have a mind of its owns. Here's what it does without my asking it - 1. shuts down randomly and has to be restarted by holding the power button and lower end of the volume rocker for about 15 seconds; 2. randomly starts different pieces of software including a suspiciously high frequency of instances of Google Play Music, which I have since disable, 3. Starts the flashlight from the pull down menu if the phone is placed face down on a shiny flat surface, 4 And randomly starts other programs after unlocking the phone with a pin. On the plus side the camera does good work and the phone is easily held in one hand and scrolled with fingers from the same hand while eating hit wings with the other. :-) Ray I'm very glad I read this article. I was on the fence - and almost pulled the trigger the other day but very glad I didn't now. I'll wait for the next gen and hopefully it's a much better piece of kit - and possibly cheaper. lomsha Whaaaat, you don't say. rockon999 My 2015 Moto X PE's display stopped functioning properly and I needed a new device to *function* in my daily life. So I bought a pixel, yesterday. To address your complaints... I never use Bluetooth on a phone, I'm getting a case, I'll hate the speakers (but I really only use headphones), I'm no bezel snob, and finally... waterproofing? My Moto X PE was waterproofed and I can honestly say it never aided me in one single way. Sure, it felt great using the phone in the rain that one time. But I'm fairly certain an encased pixel can survive that. I know it is probably a horrible value, but I really don't want to deal with buying a $200 phone now, selling it later for $100, and then buying a new $900 phone in a few months. I don't have time to constantly be reselling and selling my devices and I don't have a spare $100 to just throw around on a device. Slurms Mckenzie Seriously have been saying most of what this article is about since day one. I have a pixel XL and I've hated it since receiving it. It's not worth what Google asks when everything that is offered can be had for half the money (quick updates not included) for that asking price it should at least offer sd card support which is something even the most basic phones have. I've been using Nexus phones since the beginning (skipped the 6) and the problems with them were expected as it was a budget friendly phone but if you want to charge premium pricing don't use cloth for your ear piece cover, have dual speakers, and for God's sake don't make deals with the devil (Verizon) to lock down MIMO as a carrier specific feature when every damn phone is capable of and and most carriers are as well F*** you Pixel XL you sack of shit what a waste of 800 bucks Rod Best camera Google photos unlimited backup at original resolution Best performance Lowest touch latency of all Android phones "Just" that. micahthomas Basically all you're saying is wait if a new version is going to be released in 6 months. Might as well just say that, doesn't really have anything to do with if it's iPhone or Android. JG I was about to order my mother a 32GB Pixel a week or so ago to replace her Nexus 5X. I recently discovered the glass of its camera lens has a pretty decent crack in it. It doesn't seem to affect pictures - yet... But we're planning a fairly photogenic trip this summer and I figured the Pixel has a better camera and has unlimited free full resolution Google Photos uploads so... But as I was about to click the "Add to Cart" button, I thought we're not all that far from the expected October release of the Pixel 2. I'm sure mom wouldn't mind being a generation behind, but... derk p just replace the housing on hers. i bought a white one but then wanted a blue back... was cheap on ebay and is very easy to snap on and snap off dizel123 Relatively speaking we're not too far from October of next year for the Pixel 3. Or October 2019 for the Pixel 4... toast I never buy Apple, and I never buy Samsung. But both of their hardware just feel slicker than the Pixel. As the article says, knock a few hundred off the price, and I'd be a keen buyer, mainly for the camera and fast OS updates, and Google "Purity". I'll wait and see how the upcoming Moto Z and X phones turn out. Defenestratus It'll be difficult for me to go back to a Google phone after the nightmare that was my 6P. Major Sceptic Availability is no problem in my neck of the woods , and I appreciate the work Google did on the camera as a point and shoot and smooth software , but after looking at the pixels they looked a bit underwhelming in the feature department , and then as mentioned the outrageous​ prices for the pixels I wouldn't go near one . I might add with the smooth software , Google no longer has the Monopoly on as most devices with 7.0 onwards are very good . Rod What feature does it miss? redsoxwin I'm not sure what this person's agenda is, but this is great phone. Strange article. Amie Perry Porter I personally love my Pixel phone. Will Dutton I never cease to be amazed that everyone always thinks that 'the next one will fix it' with android John Quincy Adams Whining about bezels is ignorance. Without bezels, how do you hold it? . ..please, bezel whiners...answer this... gar216 I'm a happy Nexus 6p user. Even prior to launch I couldn't justify upgrading my 7 month old 6p to a Pixel XL. It would have clearly been an upgrade, but I didn't think it was enough of an upgrade for the price. Also... It's kinda ugly. SiliconAddic "The Google Pixel is a notoriously hard phone to get a hold of. Persistent stock issues have plagued Google's first "in-house" handset from day one, and things really are little to no better in the six months since the launch event. " Um BS. Google has ALWAYS his issues with distribution. The Nexus 5 had this issue, the Nexus 6 had this problem, the 6p also had this problem and now the pixel. Google is incompetent when it comes to this. Meanwhile Apple can launch a new phone and you can walk into any of their stores and pick one up. I wanted a Pixel to replace my Nexus 6, could not get one. I ended up with a S7 edge. Google and Nintendo should team up with their inability to ship jack ****. Eric How does this stand to affect the resale value / trade-in value for current pixel owners under project fi? I'm asking as someone who switched to project fi from Verizon prepaid in early January, and has almost been regretting it ever since. I am a quadriplegic in a power wheelchair to whom the pixel with Google Assistant seemed a natural front runner, due to its voice capabilities, and project fi with it's much touted multi Network and Wi-Fi hopping capabilities seemed a good decision as well. Did my due dilligence and the 4G network to all appearances covered me completely, even though I live with my elderly parents in a rural area. The only option available for order at the time was a white Pixel (not XL) and 32gb. I was nervous about the 32 part at the time, but felt comfortable with the infinite backup capability of Google photos. Now, 3 1/2 months later, not only is service spotty, audio crackly despite not being a candidate for replacement under the microphone bug, and Google's customer service... Let us politely say not the most helpful on the issue. I apologize about the length of this comment, (and after reading over it I really should have made it a direct message) but the difference between a phone worth $600 and the phone worth $300 in retail/tradein is quite a big deal to someone like me, and as much as I love my pixel (and admire/fear/respect Google) getting out while the getting is good is starting to sound the smarter move. ( especially after the 180 they made on the 5x.... Grrrrr) Was curious to get an educated opinion on the subject. Thanks again for your ( and anyone else's who has read this far) time and any insight offered! dizel123 Opinion: Even if you can, you probably shouldn't read David Ruddock's articles anymore. Adam Myself having been using the Pixel since day one, I would agree to an extent... Would I go out a purchase a brand new Pixel/Pixel XL for full retail? Of course not! Only because the new iteration is just around the corner. Now, would I go buy a Galaxy S8 or an iPhone 7? No way, wouldn't even consider it! I have switched phones at least every 6 months for the past 3 to 4 years, between Android and iOS operating systems as well... Having said that, the Pixel has been the best phone and best experience that I have had to date! This is the first time that I haven't thought about what phone I want to get next, and to be honest there would have to be significant improvements for me to even get the newest iteration when it comes out this fall. This phone as just been that good. To sum things up... I would not buy the Pixel/Pixel XL right now at full retail cost, I definitely would NOT go out and buy a Galaxy S8 or an iPhone either... If you, like myself, really love the Pixel line and want to get one and don't already own one. I would suggest trying to hold out and get the newest release this fall. It's most definitely worth the wait! D13H4RD2L1V3 Google always seems to have issues with stocking ever since the Nexus days. Pretty embarrassing that it's still hard to get a hold of one after 6 months. Probably due for a small price cut soon, as newer phones roll out. me me yeah I loved Nexus back with Nexus 4, 5, 7. Now the Nexus banner is carried by the likes of Moto G, OnePlus.... H2OSKI So true. The bluetooth issues alone nearly make this phone unusable. Drops and cutout's every 20 seconds. Get this, my Pixel was fine UNTIL Google sent out "the server side" update to fix the Bluetooth issues my phone never had!!! Thanks Google. Mine is going back this week. Great camera crap bluetooth. I take pics occasionally​ but I need to use a bluetooth headset hours a day. Multiple headphones, headsets, and vehicle connections with all the same result...even in safe mode. Fail. Daishi Google shot themselves in the foot when they gussied up an HTC 10 and called it a Pixel. It is just any other Android phone and doesn't have the support behind it to justify the price. Six months along, it should be more than 50% off. William Ross Why the hell is this idiot comparing a 6 month old device to the newer releases? A year in smartphone years is a lifetime. That being said, the pixel still has the best most up to date software bar none! The camera is still among the best if not the best. And, although the 835 is a newer processor, the 821 is no slouch. GTFOH with this garbage article. And, I'll definitely be getting the next Pixel regardless of price. And, I'll sell my original on eBay for a pretty penny. And, this baby has no scratches any where. It's always been in a case and all glass has been protected by Liquid Armor. diggie Pixel is a $650+ phone built like a budget chinese phone. And sorry, Oneplus has Google beat on OS features while keeping "stock" feel. William Ross Oh here we go again with the one plus fans always hating on the pixel. If your phone is so great then why knock the pixel? I just don't get it. Just talk about how great your actual Chinese knockoff is. No need to hate in the Pixel. The one plus has little more than a cult following and mock my words, it'll never be a mainstream device. me me Android Police and a lot of its customers are hating the Pixel. The OnePlus fans just chime in. I own a OP3T. It simply works, yep even Bluetooth. When take tax into account, its about half the price. OnePlus fans biggest concern: price creep upwards. $300 becomes $350 becomes $390 becomes.... Goblin Shark Is this article from April 1st? Absolutely no one with any knowledge of phone tech recommended a Pixel, ever! Underspeced and overpriced, I doubt there's any trouble keeping them in stock they just know nobody wants them so they're not making any. Rod Under-spec'ed? Ok Underperforming? Nope Edgar Morales I honestly don't see what the problem is I purchased my pixel XL and have not to date had any issues whatsoever with it no Bluetooth issues no speaker issues nothing everyone is saying Michael Hannigan Hey, if you get a phone you love and it lasts just under a year, that's good enough. What more do you expect for a few hundred bucks. Appreciate the year you loved that thing and then replace it with a new one that you can love even more. Tom Takumi Okamoto OnePlus is a better phone maker than Google. A company not even 1% worth of Google. I really want a Pixel but it's not practical. Ionut Lala I'm sorry but that is clearly not a first generation device. Not the first from Google (made by HTC and let's not forget about the Nexus line). And not the first from HTC (for obvious reasons). Aquan Belk I wish other Android manufacturers went to stock Android. I know Samsung shines in it's own apps on top of Android but vanilla Android still is and always will be the best. Rod You heard the man, people. Don't buy a Pixel because it will have bad resale value and won't be updated for long. Instead, get a model that will have bad resale value and won't be updated for long, plus has worst performance, buggy software and worse camera performance. You're welcome. Stephonz My last Google phone was Nexus 5. As much as I like pure Android experience, Google has a bigheaded trend in phones. The price point was my biggest no no after the 5X. They don't offer as much features as the other well known Android companies.. amir80 I have a Pixel 32 gb and I really really like it. Everything works great and the camera is amazing and also the battey life. For me, the fingerprint sensor is a must. The S8 sensor is poorly located and the G6 sensor is too small. GeorgeDao123 Absolutely. The Pixel duo are 2 pieces of $#!¶. They run pure Android version and they are so slow to boot up and open apps though they are lag-free. Neru Nexus I've had a pixel since launch day. For one I don't agree with the bluetooth issues. Keep the phone up to date or use the bluetooth connect and play app to automate things. Second it is a over priced phone but so is an iPhone. The main reason real users should get a pixel is the updates. Sure you might need to learn something about that expensive piece of tech you bought and not just sit on your hands waiting for the apples or googles of the world to update your shit, but at least google gave us source code, kernel code and a unlocked bootloader. There are still updates being made for the old nexus 5, that's like 5 years old. Grab iphone 4s and tell me again about how fucking great those updates are lol. You can't even install apps like skype or whatsapp that thing is pooched. I can promise the world that even if google stops updating the pixel in 2018 there will be updated versions of the os you can manually install for years. Let's see if you can get more then one firmware update on your fancy new samsung s8. My money is on 1, then the s9 will launch a year later and samsung just won't care about the s8. rjcuk What if you want a slightly smaller phone? The S8 is 5.8" compared to the Pixel at 5". I really struggle to hold 6" phones. Even the Nexus 5X at 5.2" was too big to grip properly and comfortably. Janoo Ramachandran DON'T BUY A PIXEL. We have 2 Pixels at home. One bought early November 16 and the other end Jan 17. The one I was gifted this January, within 40 days had microphone related issues. I could not hear anyone on the phone, nor was the music being played out. They refused a replacement. My phone sat in the repair centre for 8 plus day and the mother board replaced. Have you ever heard of a new phone device of any other brand needing a mother board replacement in leads than 45 days WELL GOOGLE PHONE PIXEL NEEDED IT. The other phone bought early November 16 started having other issues last month and it wasn't recognizing the wifi. After at least 20 hours on the phone with the terrible google support, it had to be sent to the repair centre where it was kept for 2 weeks, you heard that right 16 days to be precise. Then the phone came back with a chip replaced. SHOULD YOI BUY A PIXEL EVER. :. NEVER SHOULD YOU LOOK AT GOOGLE AS A PHONE MAKER :. NEVER Nikhil I wholeheartedly concur here. I picked up a Pixel sometime around December which had to be promptly returned for a replacement as the volume rocker was rickety. The replacement didn't last long either. Within a month, the widely acknowledged microphone issues popped up and after almost 15 days of talking to the very incompetent Google support in India, their only resolution was to take the Pixel to the service center. The service center did not have the motherboard in stock (they had to bring it all the way from Taiwan) and my phone still languishes there even after 15 days of me submitting it. The phone suffers from not only just Gen-one product issues, but also terrible after sales support. Leonardo Baez Agree.... ait for the next generation THEN buy current generation cheaper. Jeremy Allan Actual customer service? You do realize that owners of a pixel get free 24/7 support any time, on a dedicated line for pixel owners? Exalm There is the same section in the settings on Nexus 5X and 6P. No idea whether it works, since there's no chat or phone support in Russia neither for Nexus nor Pixel. Cory Wilson I agree. Granted it was around a year ago I bought my 6p but the 6p didn't cost $870 either. Still don't regret that decision Impulse_Vigil Haven't really had any serious Pixel Bluetooth issues here... A handful of times (literally less than half a dozen) BT shut itself off back in Feb-March, hasn't happened again since the Play Services patch. I use Bluetooth on a daily 24/7 basis too with my ZenWatch 3, car audio, etc. I don't push it to its range limits tho. Dunno whether David's usage and issue is some sorta edge case, or range related, or whether he was speaking to the 1-2 month period when others were having more severe Bluetooth shut off issues. I do agree with the overall sentiment tho, Google hasn't made it easy to buy the Pixel and that's simply inexcusable. I haven't had to suffer thru any of the QC issues (no BT, mic, whatever issues here, knock on wood) but it seems they weren't handled super well either. To be honest I wouldn't even recommend the S8 to anyone either unless it's another geek/enthusiast, these days for most people it's simply not worth it to spend that kind dosh on a phone. I bought my mother a Moto Z Play; I'd probably point others towards that, the OP3, or an HTC One/S7 on sale. I'm super happy with my Pixel, but if there was a OnePlus 3-class device for Zoglog Having owned a pixel XL and now a s8+, I'd have to agree. Even not taking into account the questionable hardware reliability of the pixel (mine died in 5 months). Basically when I owned the pixel I loved the hell out of stock Android but I kept on wondering why I paid so much for it. Meanwhile with the S8+ the gorgeous screen makes it feel especially special and worth the price. Even though I would prefer stock Android 10000% sebastianer Pixel is just another Nexus. Like the 6P. There is no excuse, this is not their first premium phone. Still made by HTC instead of Huawei. And called Pixel instead of Nexus...and more expensive because of HTC and all the marketing costs. And..still has the shitty compass all their recent previous nexus had with a lot of topics open in Google product forums and staff giving tons of manuals about how to perfect calibrate something that doesn't retain calibration. But the main reason I wouldn't buy a Pixel...is the compass and secondly that you will get one more android update if you wait 6 months. username_not_valid How is the pixel the first 'in-house Google phone'? Its clearly and actually a slightly rehashed HTC. HTC doesn't just make it ,they designed it for all intents and purposes. Unless Googles design strategy happens to be exactly like HTCs then its not a Google phone. The Pixel is just an over priced nexus, nothing else. SOUL- Always great to see the smartphone community go from praising a phone to outright basing it just after a couple of months. Perfectly fine with my Pixel. Michael Sørensen It's just ... really boring. andy mckenzie It's a superb phone , blazing fast so processor is not an issue , amazing camera , free storage , online support has been fast and efficient in my experience, stock Android , I'd highly recommend to anyone. remister I am still using my 6P, I couldn't swallow the 1K price tag for 128GB with insurance.... Justin Field Yeah, I broke the screen on my 5x, and since I am on Fi I considered getting a pixel for about 2 seconds and ordered and new screen and fixed my phone. I will wait for the next gen or switch off of Fi.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Notebooks  ⋮  Software Microsoft to Unveil a New Operating System and a Premium Surface Laptop (in Four Colors) Today By Rafia Shaikh 2 hours ago 16Shares Share Tweet Submit What to expect from Microsoft's Cloudbook event today - Surface Laptop in burgundy? Microsoft is taking to the stage in New York City later today to host its hardware and software event. While the Redmond software maker has used the city to launch new Surface devices, today’s event will focus on slightly different things. Microsoft’s May 2nd event is expected to bring attention to the rumored Windows 10 S (aka Windows 10 Cloud), a new operating system from the company. Along with Windows 10 Cloud, the company is also expected to launch at least one new device that will be powered by Windows 10 Cloud and is built to compete against Google’s Chromebook. Here’s what we are expecting to see at today’s education-themed event. Windows 10 S: Microsoft to reveal a new OS later today Microsoft is hosting a special event later today and following months of rumors surrounding Windows 10 Cloud, it is highly expected that the company will finally unveil this new operating system. Related Microsoft’s All New Cloud OS Leaked – Looks Just Like Windows 10 Windows 10 Cloud – or Windows 10 S – is a lightweight version of Windows 10, offering better security and more performance. Microsoft has designed this watered-down version of Windows 10 to get into the education market and compete against Google’s Chromebooks. Leaks appearing earlier this year revealed that the OS will only allow its users to download apps directly from Windows Store, helping Microsoft support its app ecosystem too. While rumors and leaks have given us an early look into this new OS – which, again, is nothing but a lighter version of Windows 10 – Microsoft is yet to officially talk about it. One of the biggest highlights of this lightweight version of Windows 10 is the increased battery life. Microsoft has consistently worked to improve battery life in Windows 10 over the past few months and it is expected that the focus on battery life is due to this new OS, which will be paired with new hardware, offering more battery life to further focus on its education audience. Microsoft will also use its new power throttling features to help reduce background tasks’ battery consumption. Windows 10 Cloud paired with more tools for education Competing against Google Chromebook essentially means getting a share of the education market. With Windows 10 Creators Update, Microsoft already highlighted its efforts to help cater to learners. A lightweight OS along with the new 3D Paint, Minecraft, Office, and other creativity-focused features will help Redmond software maker cater to the school environments. Related Microsoft Is Readying Its Own Chromebook-Killer with Rumored Windows 10 Cloud Advertisement To attract Chrome OS users, Microsoft is going to offer better creativity features, better controls, a fast operating system, better battery life and an OS that isn’t as cluttered as Microsoft’s Windows 10. Chrome OS is popular among students because it’s straightforward, speedy and supports multiple users without requiring any tedious process. With Microsoft focusing so much on this new category, it is expected the company will offer all of these Chrome OS features and pair them with its creativity and productivity features to help Windows 10 Cloud get Chrome OS users. Along with Windows 10 S and new hardware, the company is also expected to talk about Office, introducing a full version of Microsoft Office in the Windows Store to support Cloudbooks. Chromebook-killer hardware: Cloudbook or Surface Laptop? While we aren’t expecting to see a new Surface Book 2 or Surface Pro 5, Microsoft is rumored to release at least one new hardware product, showcasing the power of Windows 10 Cloud. Today’s education-themed event will unveil Microsoft Cloudbook (or Surface Laptop as a recent leak has suggested) that will help the company prove its new software-hardware duo is ready to kill Google’s Chromebooks. It’s unclear whether this new hardware will be made by Microsoft itself or the company will focus on an OEM product that is powered by Windows 10 Cloud or Windows 10 S. It is very much possible that we are introduced to multiple Cloudbook products made by Dell, HP, Acer, and others. If Microsoft does introduce its own Cloudbook, it is likely to be more premium and hence more expensive than the products launched by its partners. A leak today suggested that Microsoft will introduce its Windows 10 S powered Cloudbook calling it “Surface Laptop”, which will feature a 13.5-inch PixelSense display and a luxurious Alcantara-covered keyboard. Leaked images show a USB port, mini DisplayPort, and the Surface power connector. The laptop will reportedly ship in platinum, burgundy, cobalt blue, and graphite gold colors and will weigh 2.76 pounds. Microsoft’s May 2nd event will kick off at 9:30 AM ET or 6:30 AM PT today, which is when we will get to know more about the pricing of this rumored Surface Laptop and if Microsoft is introducing it as a more premium alternative to Chromebook Pixel. If so, we do expect to see affordable options by the company’s OEM partners.

In the middle of most American cities, you would be hard-pressed to walk even one hundred feet without seeing a traffic camera watching your every move. Certain types of televisions and smartphones now have the ability to collect images we view, audio, and even personal text messages. (Related: Read about the different ways you can stop your phone from spying on you.) But now, Google seems to have taken things to the next level by seeking out intimate knowledge on medical conditions and your physical health. That’s right – it’s not enough to know about your interests and search habits; Google wants information on your body. The Baseline Project is a multi-year study that will ask volunteers to submit an egregious amount of physical test results and medical information. The project, which is expected to cost more than $100 million, will look for information regarding the warning signs of heart disease and cancer by having volunteers wear a heart-tracking watch on their wrists. The watch will track the volunteer’s pulse and movements in real time. In addition, the project participants will undergo x-rays and heart scans, have their genomes deciphered and blood tested. Even though Google will only monitor each volunteer for four years, the entire experiment may very well take a decade to complete, considering the fact that the project will examine a total of 10,000 participants. Sanjiv Sam Gambhir, a physician researcher at Stanford University explained, “No one has done this kind of deep dive on so many individuals. This depth has never been attempted.” Gambhir added, “It’s to enable generations to come to mine it, to ask questions, without presupposing what the questions are.” The Baseline Project was officially announced in 2014, but the study was so complicated that it took an additional two and a half years to organize. “We need to continue to look for signals that may be actionable,” said Verily’s chief medical officer Jessica Mega. Verily is a branch of Google that focuses on health and the study of life sciences. “And we need to build out infrastructure to be able to do that,” Mega continued. “Those tools will be important for the health-care ecosystem. We are creating the infrastructure to deal with large health data sets.” In addition to the monitoring of the participants’ heart rates and medical conditions, the study also requires volunteers to provide stool samples, saliva, and tears. As if this wasn’t enough, participants must sleep with an electrical loop underneath their mattress to record their sleep patterns. The data collected from this electrical loop would then be transmitted to a separate device inside of the participant’s home, which would then be sent to Google’s servers. While Google seems to have the details of the study all planned out and ready to go, Eric Heckler, a professor at Arizona State University, has his doubts. “The question is why should people continue to give you data,” he says. “People wear a wrist tracker for a few months, but even the burden of charging one will make them stop. There is a lot of hounding involved.” Professor Heckler raises a very important point. Considering how long each of the volunteers will be monitored, and considering how much work they will have to do on their own time in order to continue sending information to Google’s servers, the chances that the information will remain accurate are extremely slim. Thus far, Google has not provided any information regarding how specifically the collected information will be used, nor have they explained how they plan on ensuring that the medical information remains safe.

So, we are on a Grail Quest for similar talent – the best of the best React/Redux specialists, Unity developers, data scientists, and data engineers (proficient with TensorFlow), technical project managers (who used to do the above, but have evolved into managers), and technical account executives.

GitHub, the most popular open source community, is a haven for engineers. If you write great code, you are rewarded by popularity, as well as the accolades of your peers. It is one of the purest meritocracies in the world. GitHub is also the place where top-tier tech companies make would-be proprietary programming languages, frameworks, and tools available for free – a Machiavellian move that allows engineers to self-select into a pool of qualified applicants perfectly trained to work for them. And, here's why the rules are not what they seem: if you build something popular on GitHub using Facebook's or Google's code, they will see it, and a recruiter will contact you. That's how the "GitHub recruiting pipeline" works. We run a business, not a school I am personally amazed by the number of recruiters who have sent us "vetted" professional coders who can't actually code. This is such a serious problem that if a recruiter sends us three candidates who cannot pass our coding test, we fire the recruiter. We can't afford to waste the time. Tech recruiters charge 18 to 25 percent of the first year's salary, but even the best recruiters we've worked with cannot truly vet the types of engineers we need. As far as I can tell, recruiters are not under pressure to learn, because high-end tech talent is so rare, hiring managers will take practically anyone who can fog a mirror. We won't. And you shouldn't. In practice, we could train these workers, but not at market prices with added recruiter vigor. We just can't get enough value out of B-team players while they are in training, and by the time we help them become A-team players, their GitHub accounts and contributions will reflect their learning. At that point, they will be firmly on the radar of top-tier tech. And we would have played the role of pre-school for Facebook, Google or Apple. Great for Zuck, Larry or Tim, but not so great for us. There must be somewhere to learn this stuff There is somewhere to learn this stuff. You learn it by doing it every day and communicating with the community that is doing it every day. It's not taught in schools and it is constantly evolving. In fact, this may be top-tier tech's secret weapon. Just like Tim Cook (Apple) owns the physical supply chain for every component you might need to make a smartphone, top-tier tech literally owns the programming languages and frameworks used to create them – even though they are free for all of us to use. © Provided by CNBC Awesome and insane None of this would be an issue if top-tier tech did not make its code available open source. We have this problem only because they need talent as much as we do. That said, we're going to keep looking for amazing programmers and my offer stands. I can't wait to pay you $500,000 per year.

Opinion: Even if you can, you probably shouldn't buy a Google Pixel anymore David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/05/01 2:09pm PDTMay 1, 2017 66 Plus 1 on G+ 263 Share on Facebook 60 Share on Twitter Total Shares389 Editorials Pixel Pixel XL The Google Pixel is a notoriously hard phone to get a hold of. Persistent stock issues have plagued Google's first "in-house" handset from day one, and things really are little to no better six months after the launch event. Honestly, it's a bit embarrassing just how consistently incompetent Google seems to be at keeping a reasonable inventory of phones available for purchase. But setting that aside, as one of the Pixel's most ardent evangelists, I think there's something it's probably time for me to come clean on: Even if you could buy a Pixel today, I really think you shouldn't. The Pixel is a product with generation-one product issues. The Bluetooth performance is horrid. It's not waterproof. The bezels really are due for a shrink. I don't think the exterior coating on the black and blue variants is of a particularly high quality. The glass window gets scuffed up incredibly easily. The Snapdragon 821 is officially old news. And it doesn't support proper advanced network features across all four of the big US carriers. There are other flaws I could point to, and while none of them are too terrible, they do speak to the slightly-rushed development cycle this phone seems to have been subjected to. Sure, Google got some things astoundingly right: the performance, the camera, the larger software experience. In fact, I think the Pixel is easily the best Android smartphone ever for these strengths, at least if we're talking about me personally as a user (your mileage, obviously, may vary). But for all the great, smooth, fast, clean, pure, simple, natural, and various other adjective-members singing in the Pixel-praise cavalcade, this phone is not the one to buy right now. For starters, Google continues to ask what is an increasingly laughable amount of money for the model most of us want - the 128GB XL - at a staggering $870. Sure, Apple charges the same for an iPhone 7 Plus 128GB, but I'm under no illusion that this comparison in any way favors Google. The iPhone comes with Apple customer service (with actual stores), a longer software support period going forward, and runs no real risk of poor resale value. The Pixel? Google's online support is iffy at best, we know the phone will be unsupported by October 2018, and I have a strong feeling generation-one Pixel resale values will drop like a rock once the new phones are announced. And that really is why, if you haven't pulled the trigger on a Pixel yet, you should just wait. It's overpriced, under-supported, and competing phones like the Galaxy S8 offer a whole lot more technology for your money. The Galaxy S8+ is $20 less than a 128GB Pixel XL, and I would argue it is far and away the better smartphone value. That amazing display, brand-new Snapdragon 835 processor, jaw-dropping design and packaging, and the full support of all our American carriers' latest LTE advancements could each be a reason on its own to put the Galaxy S8 above Google's smartphone. Do I still prefer using the Pixel over the S8? Sure. But I wouldn't buy a 128GB Pixel XL over a Galaxy S8+ today. That would be, frankly, a bit silly. If Google was asking $670 and not $870, the discussion would probably change, but they aren't. You've got to pay full price, and there's no way I could recommend anyone do that. If you're still on the fence about the Pixel, let me try to push you over: wait for the next generation. I realize that this sort of thinking can devolve into a rationale that encourages you to never upgrade anything because something newer, faster, and better is constantly on the horizon. But in this case, I think it's a consideration that is worth weighing more seriously than usual. Many of the Pixel's biggest flaws relate to Google's inexperience producing a smartphone. Issues that only come up as you try to mass-produce and distribute a product with a real marketing campaign that creates real demand, and the phone gets into the hands of "real" users who aren't part of the now-derailed Nexus phone hypetrain. Inside Google, expectations were no doubt managed, realities realized, and priorities accordingly re-calibrated after this first launch. (Side note: if the Bluetooth performance on the next Pixel is as bad as the first one, I may scream, Google.) Meanwhile, the things that make the Pixel great aren't going anywhere. The next Pixel will be fast, it will take great photos, and it will offer a wonderfully unfettered Android experience. Those that make it less than great? Google is no doubt drilling down through the worst of them in order to ensure the Pixel 2 - or whatever it's called - won't make the same mistakes that the original did (waterproofing, please). And one of the primary reasons to try the Pixel in the first place - to be on the very bleeding edge - really only remains true from a software standpoint. Older phones like the Nexus 5X and 6P don't even let the Pixel have an advantage there, as they're on the same update track until around the time the next Pixel phones launch. If you absolutely need a smartphone soon and the Pixel is tempting you, ask yourself this: Can you deal with a Moto G5 Plus for six months if it means having a better Pixel down the road? While as a reviewer I have the admitted luxury of not needing to consider such things, were I in such a position, I'd have little in the way of a counterargument to offer. Sure, you'll take a resale hit on anything you buy now, but the Pixel is going to face a much, much steeper devaluation curve in that time than any budget phone. Buying a Pixel right now just doesn't make sense. I love my Pixel XL, but I'm officially done recommending the phone to friends and relatives. Instead, I'll tell them to wait, or to get the Galaxy S8 they were probably going to buy anyway. Tags editorial google pixel google pixel xl opinion pixel xl subscribe ...

Google really shot themselves in the foot with availability. My name is…. No, they shot their foot with huge bezels, with lack of waterproof, lack of dual speakers, no real camera progress compared to nexii, meh battery life, meh screen. No real selling point besides being pure android phone. This phone had iphone price but was worst on so many levels (no A10 SoC, no iphone-fast NAND, no 4yrs updates) Oneplus on the other hand........ M. Luciano Also has none of that stuff, but is cheaper? My name is…. yes, half price cheaper. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ The black screen issue kind of negates anything else ;) Michael Hannigan What's the "black screen issue"? Carson Saldanha YOU WANT THE PIXEL TO HAVE THE A10 CHIP?? BHAAAAAAAHAHAHA My name is…. No, i want it to have a cheaper price, or be better somehwere else, like the Galaxy. STOP BEING RUDE Carson Saldanha https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CYF7C6hVAAAKF-_.jpg Tr3ple Shut up troll ,nobody likes you I see lmao My name is…. You know when you see the dumb guy, he always adds 'lol' or 'lmao' at the end of his sentence. And his syntax is always wrong. STFU and GTFO Liam Bulkley "You know when you see the dumb guy... And his syntax is always wrong." "You are an [sic] ignorant" Don't cut yourself on the glass. Michael Hannigan They have that - The Nexus 5x. Тарас Мукин You keep hating Pixel in the comments, but you only look at numbers. But they doesn't matter when it comes to Google. Software experience does. My name is…. That's a stupid argument Тарас Мукин And saying that somebody's argument is stupid without any explanation is a much smarter argument. My name is…. Would you pay 900$ bucks for Nexus 5 just because "Software experience matters"?? Carson Saldanha Nobody said they were paying just for the "software experience" Matt Tapac said that specs don't matter, the software experience does. That heavily implies that people are paying for the software experience. Carson Saldanha xD here we go again drunken_bastard Pixel and Pixel XL have better cameras and screens than any iPhone. The difference in SoC and other bits of hardware, they don't translate into any real world speed differences. Pixel also has great battery life. Perhaps some hands on time may do you some good. supersanborn Given that they continually sell out of the limited stock they have, none of what you cited matters. If they had a ginormous supply of units and THEN couldn't sell, then perhaps you would be on to something. My name is…. What was the availability in the first place? You think they produced many? No way Jose, i bet Galaxies and iphones outsold pixels by multiple times supersanborn We don't exactly know what they had hoped to produce or even what they actually produced, so your point remains conjecture. And who here is suggesting that Samsung and Apple phones didn't outsell the Pixel? My name is…. * by multiple times James Betti Sadly, Google isn't keeping the Pixel in stock because they don't care about their hardware line. Google makes most of its money through ads and personal data. It's a shame, but it explains why they discontinue successful products and barely have much in stock. Excellent phone by the way. Michael Hannigan Well, that's easy to rectify. Do like Amazon and offer the same exact hardware with "special offers" for a lower price. Then you get to see ads everywhere, even your home screen and app drawer. Pretty cool. Michael Hannigan Yes, they did. It was in the millions. Max "no real camera progress compared to nexii, meh battery life, meh screen." Ok, so you don't have a Pixel, we get it. My name is…. I'm not dumb, do you get that too? Xchris I think the consensus here is that you are talking bollocks. The pixel XL has an unbelievably good screen, one of the best battery life figures, still has the best camera out of any smartphone. Nobody who bought the pixel cares that much about any of your other points. In fact, what you are really saying is that you didn't like the pixel. Big deal! My name is…. Actually, i'm fighting the pixel in a nerdy community. Its expected that the consensus is that "i am talking bollocks". People here mainly wanna root their phones and put center clocks on status bar. they did the same with Nexii devices, its all about the software, but those phones were seriosly lacking (i used to own all Nexus devices after 4) Carson Saldanha So may I ask, what phone do you use now? My name is…. 1+3 Carson Saldanha Srsly!?!? Bruh, the OnePlus 3 has a Snapdragon 820 while the Pixel has a 821, a far better camera, better performance, and software. How is the OP3 better than the Pixel? Besides the price? I could probably understand if you had the OP3T, but no way. My name is…. You are an ignorant. 1) Check the speedtests, 1+3 is faster (because better nand) 2) Software is better on 1+3 (aosp with tiny mods) 3) Pixel has underclocked 821, thus 820 with a little bit of better battery life (1+3 has 1080p screen to tie this up) 4) 1+3 has 6gb ram (will be good for 4 years) 5) 1+3 is smaller than pixels, unbelievably thin 6) 1+3 has dash charging (world leading) 7) 1+3 has half the price 8) 1+3T is another story, far better Apply cream to the burn, son PS Yes Pixel has a better camera. Carson Saldanha Ignorance at it's finest. My name is…. Those are all FACTS, son. My name is…. Where are you, son? Jack Smith Have you ever even used a Pixel? Only Android phone i have used with zero touch lag. Can we also stop the name calling? Mason Andrew Maseda Hate to break it to you man. I own The One Plus 3T the Google Pixel the Nexus 6P and the Moto X pure edition. Lol. Guess witch one is my daily driver? The Pixel. Why? Better battery . Better cam. All around the most reliable phone. Even with my Nexus 6P I've had some issues here and there tiny ones. Like some days my battery life was abnormally shit and the next day it was great. The one plus 3T has tiny issues too. The Pixel is a phone that you wouldn't understand UNLESS YOU TRY ONE FOR A DAY. come back when you do. tansuperman Not sure why people think the pixel takes good pics. I have a pixel xl, 950xl, IPhone 7plus, and now the s8. In my opinion the pixel xl takes the worst pics. The lumia 950xl is stop dog. The pixel I can tell is just too overprocessed Michael Hannigan I think it applies mostly to low light pictures - absolutely nothing touches the Pixel in that respect - trust me. More generally, it applies to the software and hardware working together to create stunning (real) HDR pictures. But in low.light, which according to a friend of mine who is a smartphone camera freak (I am not), quality of low light pictures are what users are primarily interested in because he says "...any recent smartphone can take great pictures in daylight.". For me, I liked the flexibility of the V20 camera - not just the dual lenses, but the absolutely fantastic functions in the camera app. D13H4RD2L1V3 Um, the 821 consumes less power than the 820 at the lower clocks due to a more efficient binning process. Also, both the Pixel and OP3 use UFS 2 controllers. But on Nougat, the 3 uses F2FS for its filesystem. It's not a case of better NAND. It's a case of different filesystems. Michael Hannigan I think they should use FAT16. I miss it. Chris Rey I will say the Axon 7 is just as good as the OnePlus 3 and looks better. Suicide_Note The Pixel camera is definitely superior to what was in the 6P, and i say that as someone who currently owns them both. M. Luciano I use both on a daily basis. Agree with you 100%. So do objective measurements of the cameras. Pixel is the best on the market; 6P is decent but not great. andy_o On paper both cameras should be just short of identical, but the Pixel is so much faster in processing cause of the HVX dedicated core, plus the N6P throttles like crazy (in one of my photospheres tests in a warm room the Nexus 6 beat it every time). This is crucial especially with Google who is prioritizing computational photography probably on par or more with hardware camera specs. Also, I'm not sure if this is a hardware or artificial limitation, but HDR+ auto has completely different behavior on the Pixels. I can understand how someone who has only looked at the specs and not used a Pixel and N6P (especially in the summertime), can think that there's been "no real camera progress", but this guy is balls-deep in the "arrogance of ignorance". Michael Hannigan I think the reason for the difference in HDR+ in the Pixel is that it's" real HDR - it takes several pictures and then layers them. Other phones have taken a shortcut do doing that with one picture and it really doesn't achieve the same. Except in one case - manually setting HDR in my Note 7 gave absolutely stunning night time photos. Something I can't quite achieve with the built in software on the Pixel (but can with Photoshop). andy_o I was talking the difference between HDR+ auto in the Pixel and HDR+ auto in the previous phones. The auto behavior in the Pixel is different, but the HDR+ processing is basically the same. There's more info here: http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/11/21/deep-dive-closer-look-google-pixels-camera/#What_does_HDR_do If you feel nerdy enough I can link you to a paper on HDR+ by the Google computational photography team too :) Regarding the other phone cameras, the reason they do worse isn't exactly that they they're taking shortcuts, it's actually because they're doing it the traditional way, taking different exposures. Read the AP article linked above for details on how HDR+ is fundamentally different. Michael Hannigan You have OLED burn-in? I have about 8 hours SOT/day and don't have any. That would piss me off. Jason B Inverting colors for a bit while doing some extended reading helps. Black background with white text is easier on the eyes too. But yeah, static nav bar and notification area aren't great for OLED. There should be auto pixel shift to prevent it ... or Google should make more use of Immersive Mode. whispy_snippet Ugh. Like a broken fucking record here sometimes. Shawn Spring While some of your other points may/may not be valid, to say that the Pixel had "no real camera progress compared to nexii" just makes you sound ignorant. The S821 ISP alone would make the camera in the Pixel superior, not to mention the updated HDR algorithms. Get a Pixel owner and a 6P owner in the same room (I was both) and ask them to shoot with each others phone and see who prefers which. The 6P camera lag in HDR mode was inefficient at best and unbearable at worst. And it wasn't that long ago that OnePlus was using a broken invite system, had people lick their phones, and had a horribly gender insensitive marketing campaign. I'd probably not hold them up as the standard bearer against Google. Michael Hannigan They had people lick their phones? Why did they never ask me to do that? That's discrimination. I should have been asked to lick my phone. Brett Lewis I love my pixel after coming from a HTC 8x on Windows platform. Never liked Apple and never will. And lately after all the talk of Samsung's products (blowing up, red screens, other problems) I'm quite happy with my pixel. I don't need water proofing I'm not an idiot that takes my phone near water.. the I hardly notice the bezels after coming from a 4.3 inch 720 display.. The htc8x had one of the widest angle front cameras but I dont take selfies. This pixel does what I want and is fast doing it. And for first time experiencing Android I'm quite happy with buying this with the newest and best version available. TheHater So only idiots take their phones near water? I bet if you had a water resistant phone, you'd take it near water. Michael Hannigan What about the toilet? Who doesn't read the news when sitting on the shitter? Mariano Moreira I would definitely agree in terms of the Pixel XL vs iPhone 7 plus comparisons (Non-32GB model) Comparing the base iPhone 7 vs base Pixel...the iPhone 7 base had(has) slow Nand performance from what I have witnessed. The 32GB iPhone 7 vs base 32GB Pixel (5") seems like a closer comparison where the compromise is better battery life on the Pixel, faster Nand, and better screen. Again, I concur that looking at the Pixel XL vs iPhone 7 Plus leans more heavily towards Apple especially when comparing the 128GB models. Michael Hannigan If you buy from the Google store, they are carrier agnostic - absolutely 0 carrier bloatware. Mariano Moreira No. I have a Google Play(Bootloader unlocked) purchased Pixel. Normally used on Sprint or At&t. When I activate on Verizon: to get Vo-LTE calling with Verizon SIM and certain carrier settings it does a software update switching the phone over to the Verizon specific software build. If it was truly Carrier-agnostic it wouldn't force a Carrier specific Software build onto my non-Verizon model Pixel. Michael Hannigan You must have either bought it from Verizon or screwed something up. An unlocked phone doesn't suddenly become carrier specific like you describe Mike John Quincy Adams I don't one person who owns or says ’I sure wish I had a OnePlus.' Michael Hannigan I have - when I had the OnePlus One. Many people asked me about it. You can't deny that OnePlus phones offer an unbeatable value. They don't skimp on specs and sell for half the.price they should. asrat_24 I get you're trying to make fun of that guy but don't make ignorant statements while trying to do it. Oneplus makes good phones and people are interested enough nowadays to say that. Major Sceptic Agree on all points , a mid range device with a flagship price , perhaps Google will adjust the prices on the 2 ? for a company trying to expand it's phone sales it's going a funny way about it . Artem Russakovskii Well, usually at that point you start seeing significant discounts, but the Pixel is a misnomer in that regard to due to low stock and high demand. Max Exactly, I would revise that affirmation to state: "I've always felt once we are less than 6 months from the new iteration, it's a mistake to buy the existing product *at full price*." supersanborn I'll grant there's a case to be made for some phones where waiting can result in substantial discounts (especially from HTC/LG/etc). Probably a little of my bias sneaks in here. I prefer to have the newer device, and if I waited 6 months post-launch, it probably means I myself need to wait until the next launch. Max I'm with you there, I usually buy a phone at launch or a couple of months later at most but remember that we aren't regular customers, that's why we read and comment on this site ;). For many people out there it makes more sense to buy a phone six months after release if it comes with a nice worthy discount. M. Luciano This ^^ supersanborn Agreed, for some, shaving $100-200 off the price is all that matters. I usually caution folk pretty hard in the last 3 months before the new iteration drops if they have any form of new feature/size/color envy. supersanborn And yeah, I'm nowhere near the "normal" consumer :-) needa Supposed to be picking up a 32gb XL (Google) for $450 near mint in a couple hours. I might not get it, but a killer deal nonetheless. M. Luciano Smash that deal :) Very nice. needa A few little scratches on the back glass. Profit.

The lowest I've seen on Swappa was $695 for a black XL. supersanborn True. I usually find that the discounts are kind of on the "meh" side though until we hit release of new product. I always basically tell folks that you either buy it at launch until about 6ish months post-launch, and if you've held off that long, you should just wait until next launch and either buy the old product at a big discount or buy the new one. Matt I believe your use of misnomer was a bit of a misnomer. Artem Russakovskii I did use the wrong word, you're right. el_smurfo That's why I just picked up a 6p last year for $400. Most expensive smartphone I've ever bought, but the full release price was just not in my budget. Karly Johnston Battery issues? MisterAlex Maybe an anomaly... but not a misnomer. paxmos Where is this high demand you guys talk about?, I have yet to see a pixel in anyone's hand M. Luciano Really? I know over a dozen people who have or had them. paxmos Yep...I see lots of iPhones and Sammy's, even one Blackberry Z30, have only seen a pixel in the Verizon store. M. Luciano I feel like a nerd owning 4 Major Sceptic It does seem to have more of an enthusiast following , no shortage of pixels in my region , the usual brands , apple, Samsung, still seem to have the sales , I know not one person that has a pixel or wants one , and I think Google only has itself to blame on that front, Re : the cost of a pixels . Goblin Shark Finally, someone who knows what they're taking about - my head is just shaking in disbelief reading what these marshmallow brains that think they know about phones are saying on this comment thread lol Daishi Exactly. I have yet to see a Pixel in the wild. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ To be fair, HTC isn't used to such a high demand for their phones. Google unfortunately paid the price Daishi This made me LOL! A post full of WIN for sure!! Zoglog Actually it's probably because of all the RMA's they've gotten JD Thought that was obvious. syxbit I wonder whether we shouldn't wait for Pixel + 2. The next Pixel may technically be the first Google made product (current Pixel is made by HTC), so it's possible the Pixel 2 will have first gen problems. Still, I still have the N6P (after I scoffed at the Pixel price and refused to buy it), so I going to be looking for a phone soon. Good_Ole_Pinocchio HTC is also manufacturing the Pixel 2. Word on the street. Daishi That's too bad. I'll avoid this this phone as well... Captain On! Well, technically the iPhone is made by Foxconn, so... Don't expect Google to actually build their own facilities to produce hardware. Carson Saldanha Pretty sure they'll still be using HTC. Might have more control over the design this time around though. 4Ui812 The availability issue is a play out Nintendo's handbook. Good_Ole_Pinocchio 100% agree with the entire article... Do I want the Pixel Software Experience and Camera? Yes... But not when the new version is a few months away thag would probably fix all the issues I see posted on this site ever so often...starting with the Bluetooth issues. I got an S8... Because it's the only phone thay makes sense to me right now..... I'll see what Google is doing in the fall Max Johnson If the Moto G5 Plus had NFC I would have no problem making it my Android daily driver for the next 6 months. wade_county Moto Z Play and OP3/OP3T are other options with NFC. shadowx360 I used to buy 1 generation old Nexus devices to get around the cost issue, but it seems the 5X and 6P both are plagued by serious phone-killing issues. Now that warranty is up on nearly every used 5X/6P, buying used is like trying to navigate a minefield. I don't really trust 1st generation Pixel to not have serious issues either. I'd never use a non-Pixel/Nexus device but I can't buy a Pixel XL knowing Samsung offers so much better hardware at a similar price. wade_county My advice is getting the next OnePlus phone or picking up a used OP3/OP3T. AndrewGM I bought a used Pixel in good shape on eBay, as I couldn't get one from Google Store (already had a wireless provider). Switched from an iPhone 6s, after using almost every iPhone model since and including the original. Much better camera on the Pixel, especially closeups and in low light, and much easier to use overall (especially Contacts vs. iOS), as I've used mostly Google apps for a long time. I like the Google keyboard much better and the Android interface. I'm definitely satisfied with the Pixel and have no real iPhone regrets. It's true there are more apps for the iPhone, but that doesn't matter because the core apps are available on Android too. The only app I miss is Enlight, for photo editing. The one Pixel issue I agree with is the relatively poor resale value vs. iPhones (I assume). Carson Saldanha May I suggest Snapseed for photo editing? (It's developed by Google) Also, do you miss iMessage/FaceTime or is that really a con? AndrewGM Will check out Snapseed, thanks. I've been using Google Photos to lightly edit pics. The Pixel camera is so good that I often don't edit (for Instagram/FB uploads), especially if the light and composition are already good. I don't miss iMessage at all. I had to turn it off and all that stuff for my phone number when I switched, but I'm texting away every day. Emoticons seem to work fine. I don't even think about iMessage. FaceTime has been replaced with Duo for my family members, including those on iPhone. Seems to work fine. And I can share location with family members via Google Maps. I guess that brings up privacy issues vs. using Apple products, but not sure it makes a real-world difference. Battery life, btw, seems pretty good (I charge the phone overnight only). The call quality is a little less than iPhone, maybe, but overall acceptable. AndrewGM Will add that I have had the Pixel for 2 months and use it daily. I like the screen on the Pixel (or at least it never bothers me), and the issue about the "chin" at the bottom being big is a non-issue to me. I don't notice it and in fact hold the phone sometimes there, which is arguably convenient. If the phone continues to hold up, I'll be a customer for Pixel 2 eventually. Eric I was ready to jump to the Pixel XL after returning my second Note 7, but Google never gave me the opportunity to give them my money. Carson Saldanha xD My name is…. It was never a good device. thank you for finally admitting that. Andrew I don't think that's what the author is saying... My name is…. Someone had to be crazy to buy a pixel in the first place. I was bashing on that device from day one. Author, months later, says that the phone is no good. It was never good. Carson Saldanha Lord, would you just chill? Tr3ple I think he's retarded, gotta be it, lol. Must be it actually. Carson Saldanha troll by far Suicide_Note Except that's not at all what the author said, so you're either: A) trolling, B) incredibly dumb, or C) both of the above. Тарас Мукин Of course there's no point in buying Pixel for full price now. And there's more: there's no point in buying any device for it's starting price when it's 3 months old — tech gets old really fast today. And that's the whole point of not buying something at day one — everything gets much cheaper very fast. Samsungs do, LGs too. But Pixel for some reason didn't. And Nexuses were like this too. So — only buying Google devices right after release makes sense. Or buying them unofficially and cheaper. Sad, but true. sraj49 I always like and respect your articles. You put your views straight forward. But I tend not to agree with the tone and content of this article completely. I am living in Home of full Apple products and I own a Pixel XL. I love the Pixel in all aspects. Yes there are room to improvements which is true for everyone. Apple products are well designed, well built. As regards sorry gone are those days when Apple sorry was at is best which was until iPhone 4s/ iPhone 5. Now after the warmth period it is the same as Pixel. I going Pixel after sales support very good. I definitely agree with you on the most inefficient handling of supplies and also this is not the time to buy since meet models are coming. Just to add, I get sick when people say that the Pixel phones are not made by Google but by HTC. Everyone outsources manufacturing. Most of the phone are made by Foxcon staying from Apple. All phone manufacturers only design the hardware, software and the manufacturing is outsourced. Good_Ole_Pinocchio The HTC point that keeps coming up comes from the fact that Google didn't really dsign much hardware hete. They just used HTC parts. It's not the same as hardware being designed by apple then manufactureres elsewhere. andy_o I think he's right on that point. Google support may or may not be good, but it's online only. Apple support is famously good. For instance, the recent fixes for iPhone 6s battery problems. I booked an appointment, went into the store, they told me it would be a bit, went to a coffee shop, they emailed me, picked it up. Another time my iPad mini 2 mute switch broke. Again, appointment, go in the store, got it actually just exchanged on the spot. Google simply cannot do that. JohnyNoLegs What android phones have you owned prior to the pixel? And yes it's a HTC phone through and through. Scofabear Shots fired! I even dumped my 6P for a Moto z play. No regrets Futbolrunner Same here! That 808 was a lag fest. I even got the S8+ but returning it because it can't touch the Play's battery life. Dominic D I just bought a Pixel a month ago. I still would recommend it if you get one for fairly cheaply on swappa. It's awesome. Brian Demodulated My last 3 phones have been Nexus. Each has been less reliable than the last. I love how hackable they are but I think my next phone will be a Samsung Galaxy. Carson Saldanha Elaborate? Wdym by "less reliable" What issues? Brian Demodulated My Samsung Galaxy Nexus was incredible and still works today. My Nexus 5 was garbage - two broke within 1.5 years. My 6P is quirky - it doesn't charge on my home PC and although my wife's updated to 7.1.2 mine says it's up to date at 7.1.1. Tr3ple Get a pixel then, Samsung lol. Brian Demodulated I have my 6P another year. I'll see what's available next year when my contract is up. JohnyNoLegs Bootloops, dodgy updates, requires factory resets, breaks features, slow bug fixes. M. Luciano No offense, but you are not going to increase stability by going to Samsung. Brian Demodulated My old Samsung Galaxy Nexus was the best, highest quality, most reliable phone I ever owned. LG and Huawei's Nexus phones were less stable for me. M. Luciano I had a few of those.. they weren't as reliable. But probably because I did bad things to them. Brian Demodulated I rooted mine, loaded hacky ROMs, and carried it with me everywhere I went for 3 years. The USB and audio cables are a little loose now but otherwise it's saved me when my later Nexus phones crapped out on me. Vitali Galaxy nexus had clean stock rom, it is just Google's clean soft in a Samsung physical device and not with samsung's os Brian Demodulated Every Nexus has the clean stock ROM. It's one of the top reasons why I get them. JohnyNoLegs Going Pixel sure doesn't increase stability. It's less stable than my Note 4/Note 7. Vitali Agree with M. Luciano, but people try should move to Sony. Lookup at speed test videos of their Xperia XZs, it has beaten all smartphones by now, including the Pixel. All the biased big reviewers out there will never tell you the truth, stop thinking the S8 is the best phone in the world.. I recommend you to wait for their Xperia XZ Premium it will have sd835! After you see the XZs speed, I promise you it may be the fastest phone even in 2018. Suicide_Note No. Just...no. Vitali *A wild 8 year old fanboy comment appears* Brian Demodulated Speed isn't that important to me. I've heard bad things about Sony's flavour of Android and that it's bloaty. Vitali So you heard wrong, their software is one of the bests out there, and im talking from experience.. And Samsung have so clean and fast Android that it is just unbelievable.. Where do you get all that info from?? Vitali So you heard wrong, their software is one of the bests out there, and im talking from experience.. And Samsung have so clean and fast Android that it is just unbelievable.. "I've heard.." Where do you get all that info from?? Suicide_Note TW is much better than it used to be, but it's hardly clean and fast. Brian Demodulated I work in a large IT department. One of my buddies told me about it. He said Sony's Android UI was all over the place and annoying to use, and that his handset was 2 major versions behind the latest version of Android OS. dtox Lol don't listen to him, xperia phones are absolute trash. dtox LOL xperia = garbage D13H4RD2L1V3 Um, I'm not entirely sure. Not that I'm ragging Sony, but they haven't exactly been selling for a reason. Even Sony themselves know. I don't hate Sony phones. I personally think they're understated, solid offerings. Problem was that they were really overpriced. After seeing the XZs and XA1, seems like their pricing may have become more logical. We'll see how it goes. I'm personally hoping the XZP may even be a solid device. Not that I'll buy one but if the price is right, it'll be significantly easier to recommend. JSo Experiences differ from person to person. But It's odd the luck you have had with the Nexus devices. I've had the Galaxy Nexus, Nexus 5 and now the Nexus 5X and I have never had an issue with any of them. JohnyNoLegs No battery issues with 5X? My wifes upgraded to 7.1.1 and has never been the same, bluetooth is slow and laggy, and the battery barely gets 1.5-2 hours SOT after it used to get close to 3. Michael Hannigan Dude, you're talking about a crusty old obsolete phone. And unless you are happy getting 2 hours of battery time, you should pry the wallet open and buy something current. Complaining about your old phone won't make you feel better. Replacing it with a working, current phone that's not past it's expected useful life will. JohnyNoLegs Dude, wth are you talking about. It's a 1.5 years old. From new it was getting 4-5, right up until 7.1.1 update. Roy My 6P is the most reliable phone ever. And I had Samsung and HTC. Duder12 The last Nexus phones had bum processors from qc. royrov My Nexus 6P kissed the asphalt a couple of weeks ago, so I bought a perfect Pixel XL second hand (used 3-4 months). Its better, no regrets here. Faster and better battery, hell even snapchat is snappy on it! Tr3ple Exaclty lol, people saying the pixel isn't an upgrade to the 6p are delusional lol. They all like to hate on it u til they get one and realize how good of a phone it is. And all the bugs I've been seeing on the net are nowhere to be found and I had mine for 5-6 months now bekifft I know it's an upgrade. It's just not much of an upgrade for an enormous amount of money. Tr3ple My 6p had serious issues, I went and got a s7 egde(big mistake), the price I paid was well worth it. I'm still financing my s7 egde while I'm using a pixel, this is how much I love this phone. destinyhud I will still buy one Michael Tran If I could give you a phone for free but you had to keep it and use it and couldn't sell it. Which phone would it be? M. Luciano 128 GB Pixel XL, black supersanborn My 128GB Pixel XL in black. At least until the 2 comes and **hopefully** adds waterproofing, 600Mhz support, 4x4MIMO for T-Mobile. If you're reading, Pixel team, let's talk! Orlando aka Pixel XL Samsung Galaxy S8+ blue Tr3ple Gimme a 128 gb pixel XL black any day keithzg The bezels really are due for a shrink. Boy are you gonna rue this when the second-gen comes out and the bezels are the exact same ;) M. Luciano I sorta hope they are :) keithzg You animal! (But honestly, this is why choice is good. I find the desire for those top and bottom bezels incomprehensible, but I can entirely understand that not everyone would feel the way I do, particularly if routinely holding phones very differently.) M. Luciano I just want SOME bezels. They don't need to be huge. Just want a place to put my thumbs when holding it sideways. It's a good place for speakers IMO. Carson Saldanha Nah, to be fair, I think Google's definitely not planning on keeping them the same size if they've listened to the reviews. keithzg I mean, if they'd listened to reviews of many other phones before they put out the Pixels they would have known that too---including, for instance, the previous two generations of Nexus phones . . . So it seems likely that either (a) they know of the opinions of the commentariat and disagree, or (b) they felt technically they couldn't do it. I'm personally hoping it was somehow just (b) but they used (a) to convince themselves that it was an okay sacrifice, but that they won't have to make the same sacrifice again this year and they'll allow themselves to change up the design. But I'm not gonna bet too much money on that. Carson Saldanha Whoa, you lost be there with all those "a's" and "b's" xD Shawn Spring I think its pretty well known at this point that the time frame between when Google's negotiations w/Huawei fell through and when they picked the deal up with HTC was the cause of the "let's use the leftover A9 shells" bezel issue. So more (b) than (a) assuredly. ikeofkc If they do. Peoples' thumb muscles are going to be screwed if they use the pixel 1 handed, constantly trying to reach the back button. The chin makes one handed use possible keithzg See, that's what I mean about different folks and different strokes. I've never noticed it being of any help with my Nexus 6P, for me the top and bottom bezels are completely useless. bekifft If they actually put something useful there, like a front facing stereo speaker, I would be totally fine with that. keithzg Dammit, don't you go making me miss the Nexus 6 again! Michael Hannigan I want them to be bigger. I want to be able to lean on mine when I am standing in line at a movie. MadMartigan I am constantly amazed by the short memories. The author thinks it likely they are likely to have a better launch of P2? They do give the obvious impression that they believe the Pixel to be their first swing and a miss... Funny how quickly we forget, well, nearly every other device Google has ever tried to sell. I personally loved my 4, 10, 5, 6, and 6. But I cannot, while keeping a straight face, argue that one should expect anything better from them regarding inventory management this time around. How many times does Google have to fail on inventory management before we start pointing and laughing at the people who constantly say, "They'll get it right this time, for sure." Don't get me wrong - I would absolutely love it if Google proved me wrong on the P2. I just won't believe it until I see it. //dons flameproof suit// A'ight, I'm ready. Fire away... M. Luciano This is their first swing and a miss, but only because the shortages are for very different reasons than prior devices they sold on behalf of other OEM's. MadMartigan Who...who do you think made the Pixels? M. Luciano Google is the OEM for the Pixel phones (and tablets, and laptops, etc). HTC is the factory putting the phones together. It's a totally different legal and business agreement, and essentially means that Google has to supply most of the components, contracts, contacts, etc. and HTC is essentially an assembly line. On Nexus phones, the OEM was Samsung, or LG or Huawei, etc. and they actually designed and produced the phones, in partnership with and input from Google. Completely different. For those, the partner was able to do all the contracting and sourcing; HTC isn't doing all the work for Google this time. MadMartigan So you don't believe HTC designed the Pixel. Got it. That's all I needed to see. M. Luciano Not sure what that means, but ok. Google is now the OEM, that's what I am saying. Another Scott Nice post. I hemmed and hawed about a Pixel XL 128 for 6 weeks last fall and finally decided I just couldn't do it. Besides the fact that it was impossible to get from Google, I just couldn't justify the price. I decided to finally replace my LG Nexus 4 (roughly $350 new) with a new T-Mobile LG V10 from B&H in November for $330 and am quite pleased. (It would have been $300 a week or so later.) I added a Samsung EVO 128 GB SDHC card for it for $40 or so. I miss the Nexus timely updates a great deal, but I can't see spending a kilobuck on a phone to get it - especially for only a 2 year OS upgrade availability. I hope Google gets the Pixel 2 right, but maybe they figure having a "premium" phone for evangelists is good enough so they won't feel any pressure to make it available (or cut the price). Cheers, Scott. fijisiv The Galaxy S8+ is $20 less than a 128GB Pixel XL Just wow. M. Luciano Right? The Pixel is by far a better value at those prices. 128 GB storage over 16, metal over glass body, better software, better security, better camera, guaranteed to be up to date for 3 years... Samsung has some great components, but as a package, Pixel seems to keep ahead at this point. Matt I believe the S8+ is 64G and has a microSD slot. M. Luciano I think you're right. IMO that makes the Pixel better. Do you prefer less with expandable option? 03grunt I live in the mountains of NC and went back to Verizon once they brought back unlimited data and luckily the local Verizon store had a Pixel XL. I think it's pretty sad that in ~ 18 months the Pixel will be EOL. M. Luciano Luckily, it won't be. Nexus and Pixel devices are guaranteed to be fully up to date for 3 years; not 2. 2 years of major updates and 3 years of security updates = 3 years of being fully up to date. Sir_Brizz That's not entirely true. They are only guaranteed to be on the latest version for 2 years. It's unlikely it will be any different than the Nexus 6 in this regard (which didn't get 7.1 but is still getting monthly security updates). M. Luciano The Pixel and Pixel XL released October 4, 2016. They're guaranteed to be fully up to date until 10/31/2019. That's 1121 days, or 3.07 years. Sir_Brizz No. You are wrong. They are only guaranteed version updates until October 2018. The Nexus 6 was guaranteed the same thing until October 2016. It did not get Android 7.1 even though it continues to get monthly security updates. What this means is that the Pixel will get at least Android 9.0 but that doesn't guarantee it will get 9.1 or 9.2 or anything else past that. It just means it will get 9.0 and monthly security updates to 9.0 for an additional year. M. Luciano I get what you're saying, but it also launches on the latest update. So using the Pixel, it launches with N, will get O after a year, will get P after a year and then is not guaranteed to get Q. Are we really going to get a Q? So during each of those three updates, N, O and P, it on the latest OS and getting monthly security updates. 2 years of updates, so long as it includes the 2nd major OS update, translates to three full years. Ever since they started the annual number and letter update, we're essentially talking about a single API version update per year (2016 had 2, including the one you're referencing which impacted Shamu). Sir_Brizz I've already pointed this out twice: look at the Nexus 6 for a first hand example of how this is going to work. The Nexus 6 will not be on the latest version of Android for three years because it is already not on the latest version of Android despite getting monthly security updates. 03grunt Thanks for clarifying! Chris Kiederer As a Nexus 5X/project Fi user, right now the Pixel is my only choice if my Nexus decides to blow up like many before it. I really hope this Android one rumor heading to the US is true, as it would give project Fi subscribers more than just a really expensive option to stay on the plan Andye82 But exactly one year from today it will be still extremely difficult if not impossible to get your hands on pixel 2 Mix "Persistent stock issues have plagued Google's first "in-house" handset from day one..." I am on my 3rd phone and I still wonder, every time I use it, if it will be like my last two phones. I have phone PTSD! Google should just pull a Nintendo and just stop producing and move on to the 2 but not fuck it up. John Doe Great job on the article, now I will be waiting for the editorial on Google's software update policy LoL PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Google's inexperience producing a smartphone They had great experience running Motorola. Ammar "Sure, Google got some things astoundingly right: the performance, the camera, the larger software experience" To be honest, these are the only reasons why I'd ever get a Pixel over any other Android phone. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ I agree with some of Radar's points as well as teh main one as I've *never* recommended the XL because I know that the vast majority of people are sheep-like followers and/or technophobes, and I defifnitely don't want part of the onus for a technophobe's major purchase that they're going to rue the second that an iPhoner mocks them. The Pixel sells itself to PowerUsers on its own merit, which, AEB the popularity of inferior and/or questionable top-sellers, clearly supports my previous assertions. JPLoureiro Deciphering of your sentences will commence............. now. Futbolrunner What? Marty I never was going to buy an HTC Pixel. Don't like HTC and the build quality doesn't deserve such a high price. jawsnnn My SOs Pixel is probably the buggiest Google phone I have used till date. The Google Assistant, voice search are consistently broken and the phone doesn't offer much else in way of justifying it's price. Will definitely buy an OEM phone next. Google's hardware experiment is dead for me. Tim Harman I wish I'd read this 2 weeks ago! Oh well. I've got a Pixel now and I do love it. I live in NZ and the version I ended up with is the American one, which means that while it supports all my LTE bands, it doesn't support Carrier Aggregation on the bands used here. So that's my excuse for why I simply MUST HAVE the P2 when it's released. Damian Stuart Wow, what a load of crap! The Pixel is a superb phone with issues affecting small numbers of devices. I have one, after moving away from the Samsung range. I have had no issues and as I don't ever intend to take a phone swimming haven't got a single complaint about it. But haters gonna hate. sebastianer @David Ruddock Don't forget the terrible compass. If you grab an iPhone 5S and a Pixel. Open Google Maps in both of them. An you start walking trough dense downtowns the whole day (closing / opening maps at different places). You will see that the Pixel compass accuracy is constantly changing every time you open maps and is a total mess while the 5S is perfectly accurate after 1-2 seconds and less than one step. I hope the next Pixel has a completely new sensor...or compass or whatever. Last 3-4 Google Phones were a mess. I think the last Google phone with more or less good compass was the galaxy nexus but I can't even remember now TechGuy22 i'm selling mine soon since i know i can sell it around 600 dollars and it's the 128GB wjrandon So glad I kept my Nexus 6P for a second year... and look at those rock solid resale values. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9d5926ba5094521287d1d54e2476d3852462178bdf74a16166f94742b435213c.jpg TechGuy22 i sold mine for 500 dollars and i bought it used too lol that's how i managed to get the XL 128GB eric messenger It depends on what phone your coming from. For most android users it is a great phone with a great camera. If your coming from an iPhone the pixel is the first great alternative to an iphone. The on device support is actually awesome and they are very quick with support issues. I am used to Nexus devices plagued with serious issues that you had to work around and while they were great phones for the price I felt they all suffered (maybe not the 6P). Anyway the point is pixel raised the bar for Android and brought it up to par with Apple. It's probably still worth buying if you have to upgrade, and you can just get the pixel 3 in 2019 or 2020. Sean You can say this about any phone at the moment....wait for next gen. As a Project Fi user I am waiting on a phone that has the cell radio to take advantage of T-mobile's new 600mhz band they are quickly rolling out...and NO, it cant be done with a software update on any phone. me me "quickly rolling out"? The spectrum is sold but not available yet as the current user vacates.... Sean NOT TRUE....they are rolling it out in areas NOW where the old TV stations have already vacated the band. Google is your friend. me me finally, you realize it was crap, was always, still now, only thing now is you changed. Never worth the money, specs so-so for the price. Islam Google Pixel poor use of space. over-priced. BS Sean People that actually OWN one dont agree........ TechGuy22 i agree and i have one. sadly, it just stopped caring about the bezel since there's nothing i can do to make it look better VAVAMk_2 6P user here with a new battery happily waiting it out for Pixel 2. Sean Boot loop much? Ernie I have had my Nexus 6p since day one of the release. I have been lucky not to have encountered the boot loop or battery problems others have reported. I love my Nexus 6p. Hope it will get Android O. Phone_Addiction Pixel 2 probably going be the same story. Google will never learn. Dean F Marsh I love my Pixel XL! Invest in a good quality case and enjoy the phone. It's really pretty decent and for a few minor quirks mentioned, and none that I have experience yet, I can't be happier. From Nexus, HTC, Samsung, to Pixel XL, this has been the best so far. Ailín Ó’S I live in Ireland and Pixel isn't even available here yet which is odd given we were a launch country for Nexus 5x/6p but hey ho. Rick Schoonmaker This is just what I like to read after getting banged by Google and Huawei with the 6P bootloop issue 1 year and 2 days (read 2 days out of warranty) after buying and being told that my only option is to buy a new phone. So after being without a phone for a week, I had to buy a Pixel XL even though I really didn't want it and especially at the ridiculous price ($860 for 32Gb.. are you effing kidding?). Matt Definitely. I got a pixel XL the very first morning when it was available in local store. Great phone, camera, software. 2 months later, the phone began to behave crazily--extra hot, microphone malfunction. Called Google support for like 10 times and had it replaced, then I put the brand new replacement on local trade platform without hesitation. Google-brand is attatractive, but does not worth that rediculous amount of money. I can get a even better performed oneplus counterpart for almost half price. Anyway, I am on my moto x 2014 with lineage os 14 and i am pretty happy. It is sufficient for me to deal with my daily work. And I also suggest to wait for the release of more flagships from variant companies to have more flexible and reasonable options. Spinkick Google seems to not be able to follow through on anything these days. It just seems like if its not sexy or cool and needs actual work, they cant be bothered. Maybe they will release another chat app in the meantime.. 2 Men-E I want the Pixel 2 XXL (Taimen). It better exist as a 5.6"+ screened device. Philip Although if you're with TMobile. It's significantly cheaper to buy the Pixel, and get your money's worth. Granted the Pixel is guaranteed two years of support, it matches with TMobile promotion pay credit time. h4rr4r They offer a discount? I thought it was just financing. Philip Yep. $325 in TMobile bill credits over two years. Which is when the Pixel 3 will be out. So you buy a Pixel, get refunded about half of the cost. And then you're ready to upgrade to the third generation. belac77 shhh, David, I just listed my Pixel for sale on Swappa! ;) Mason Andrew Maseda This entire article is just terrible and written by someone just mad they don't have one. M. Luciano lol he got one the week after I did. He's had one. Adrianus Bratanata Supply and demand. As long as there is bigger demand than supply they don't need to reduce the price drunken_bastard I disagree. All the pros you mentioned for the Pixel -- pure Android experience, performence, camera, etc -- those are all the reasons why the Pixel and Pixel XL is still the best smartphone on the market. Worried a new one is going to come out? Happens with every flagship, every year. This one doesn't have the lastest SoC? I challenge you to demonstrate real world differences in actual speed versus the Galaxy S8, which is a gorgeous handset that yet again is crippled by bloated software and long standing issues that never seem to get addressed. You cite support potentially ending in October 2018 for software updates, but that's still a longer window than any other Android flagship, and you get them day one, which Samsung and LG don't. A smartphone is more than the sum of it's parts. It's an experience. I feel on that quality alone, the Pixel and Pixel XL are the best representations to date. NeMoDoSeZ I was going to buy a 128gb Pixel XL but due to not being available I ended up waiting and purchasing a Galaxy S8+. I'm now glad things ended up the way they did because I'm loving my S8+. Rod Until Android 8 is released. Then you'll like: fuck Samsung man! My U$xxx phone is outdated, goddamnit! Owen Iverson I hate the world of tech. We've now gotten used to NEEDING the latest thing IMMEDIATELY. Its why companies like Microsoft, Adobe, and Autodesk have switched to monthly/yearly subscriptions so you have to pay for the rest of your life. "The Bluetooth performance is horrid." What metric, speed? Connectivity? "It's not waterproof." Not sure that waterproof is a common trait among all high-end phones just yet. "The bezels really are due for a shrink." I've never used a bezel-less phone, where do you pick it up or hold it? Does your finger trigger anything on the edges? "The Snapdragon 821 is officially old news." What are you running where 1) you see lag and 2) that it's an actual problem. Maybe people are replacing consoles with their phones just like they're replacing their DSLRs with their phones? "it doesn't support proper advanced network features across all four of the big US carriers." What are these advanced network features? Anyway, I know it's a phone blog, so ... D13H4RD2L1V3 Well, he means that since its successor isn't far off, and that the Pixel is still not easy to get hold of, you might be better off waiting, since the Pixel is also selling at full price still. Edward jh How can the camera be great I mean what about the pixel camera lens flare issue plaguing 1000's of users. Margaritas Ante Porcos Pixel was a disaster. The worst phone for that price. I understand some of you got the Stockholm syndrome. But some of us see the clear picture. Google simply lost this round with both hands down. Dan Yurman My Google Pixel seems to have a mind of its owns. Here's what it does without my asking it - 1. shuts down randomly and has to be restarted by holding the power button and lower end of the volume rocker for about 15 seconds; 2. randomly starts different pieces of software including a suspiciously high frequency of instances of Google Play Music, which I have since disable, 3. Starts the flashlight from the pull down menu if the phone is placed face down on a shiny flat surface, 4 And randomly starts other programs after unlocking the phone with a pin. On the plus side the camera does good work and the phone is easily held in one hand and scrolled with fingers from the same hand while eating hit wings with the other. :-) Ray I'm very glad I read this article. I was on the fence - and almost pulled the trigger the other day but very glad I didn't now. I'll wait for the next gen and hopefully it's a much better piece of kit - and possibly cheaper. lomsha Whaaaat, you don't say. rockon999 My 2015 Moto X PE's display stopped functioning properly and I needed a new device to *function* in my daily life. So I bought a pixel, yesterday. To address your complaints... I never use Bluetooth on a phone, I'm getting a case, I'll hate the speakers (but I really only use headphones), I'm no bezel snob, and finally... waterproofing? My Moto X PE was waterproofed and I can honestly say it never aided me in one single way. Sure, it felt great using the phone in the rain that one time. But I'm fairly certain an encased pixel can survive that. I know it is probably a horrible value, but I really don't want to deal with buying a $200 phone now, selling it later for $100, and then buying a new $900 phone in a few months. I don't have time to constantly be reselling and selling my devices and I don't have a spare $100 to just throw around on a device. Slurms Mckenzie Seriously have been saying most of what this article is about since day one. I have a pixel XL and I've hated it since receiving it. It's not worth what Google asks when everything that is offered can be had for half the money (quick updates not included) for that asking price it should at least offer sd card support which is something even the most basic phones have. I've been using Nexus phones since the beginning (skipped the 6) and the problems with them were expected as it was a budget friendly phone but if you want to charge premium pricing don't use cloth for your ear piece cover, have dual speakers, and for God's sake don't make deals with the devil (Verizon) to lock down MIMO as a carrier specific feature when every damn phone is capable of and and most carriers are as well F*** you Pixel XL you sack of shit what a waste of 800 bucks Rod Best camera Google photos unlimited backup at original resolution Best performance Lowest touch latency of all Android phones "Just" that. micahthomas Basically all you're saying is wait if a new version is going to be released in 6 months. Might as well just say that, doesn't really have anything to do with if it's iPhone or Android. JG I was about to order my mother a 32GB Pixel a week or so ago to replace her Nexus 5X. I recently discovered the glass of its camera lens has a pretty decent crack in it. It doesn't seem to affect pictures - yet... But we're planning a fairly photogenic trip this summer and I figured the Pixel has a better camera and has unlimited free full resolution Google Photos uploads so... But as I was about to click the "Add to Cart" button, I thought we're not all that far from the expected October release of the Pixel 2. I'm sure mom wouldn't mind being a generation behind, but... derk p just replace the housing on hers. i bought a white one but then wanted a blue back... was cheap on ebay and is very easy to snap on and snap off dizel123 Relatively speaking we're not too far from October of next year for the Pixel 3. Or October 2019 for the Pixel 4... toast I never buy Apple, and I never buy Samsung. But both of their hardware just feel slicker than the Pixel. As the article says, knock a few hundred off the price, and I'd be a keen buyer, mainly for the camera and fast OS updates, and Google "Purity". I'll wait and see how the upcoming Moto Z and X phones turn out. Defenestratus It'll be difficult for me to go back to a Google phone after the nightmare that was my 6P. Major Sceptic Availability is no problem in my neck of the woods , and I appreciate the work Google did on the camera as a point and shoot and smooth software , but after looking at the pixels they looked a bit underwhelming in the feature department , and then as mentioned the outrageous​ prices for the pixels I wouldn't go near one . I might add with the smooth software , Google no longer has the Monopoly on as most devices with 7.0 onwards are very good . Rod What feature does it miss? redsoxwin I'm not sure what this person's agenda is, but this is great phone. Strange article. Amie Perry Porter I personally love my Pixel phone. Will Dutton I never cease to be amazed that everyone always thinks that 'the next one will fix it' with android John Quincy Adams Whining about bezels is ignorance. Without bezels, how do you hold it? . ..please, bezel whiners...answer this... gar216 I'm a happy Nexus 6p user. Even prior to launch I couldn't justify upgrading my 7 month old 6p to a Pixel XL. It would have clearly been an upgrade, but I didn't think it was enough of an upgrade for the price. Also... It's kinda ugly. SiliconAddic "The Google Pixel is a notoriously hard phone to get a hold of. Persistent stock issues have plagued Google's first "in-house" handset from day one, and things really are little to no better in the six months since the launch event. " Um BS. Google has ALWAYS his issues with distribution. The Nexus 5 had this issue, the Nexus 6 had this problem, the 6p also had this problem and now the pixel. Google is incompetent when it comes to this. Meanwhile Apple can launch a new phone and you can walk into any of their stores and pick one up. I wanted a Pixel to replace my Nexus 6, could not get one. I ended up with a S7 edge. Google and Nintendo should team up with their inability to ship jack ****. Eric How does this stand to affect the resale value / trade-in value for current pixel owners under project fi? I'm asking as someone who switched to project fi from Verizon prepaid in early January, and has almost been regretting it ever since. I am a quadriplegic in a power wheelchair to whom the pixel with Google Assistant seemed a natural front runner, due to its voice capabilities, and project fi with it's much touted multi Network and Wi-Fi hopping capabilities seemed a good decision as well. Did my due dilligence and the 4G network to all appearances covered me completely, even though I live with my elderly parents in a rural area. The only option available for order at the time was a white Pixel (not XL) and 32gb. I was nervous about the 32 part at the time, but felt comfortable with the infinite backup capability of Google photos. Now, 3 1/2 months later, not only is service spotty, audio crackly despite not being a candidate for replacement under the microphone bug, and Google's customer service... Let us politely say not the most helpful on the issue. I apologize about the length of this comment, (and after reading over it I really should have made it a direct message) but the difference between a phone worth $600 and the phone worth $300 in retail/tradein is quite a big deal to someone like me, and as much as I love my pixel (and admire/fear/respect Google) getting out while the getting is good is starting to sound the smarter move. ( especially after the 180 they made on the 5x.... Grrrrr) Was curious to get an educated opinion on the subject. Thanks again for your ( and anyone else's who has read this far) time and any insight offered! dizel123 Opinion: Even if you can, you probably shouldn't read David Ruddock's articles anymore. Adam Myself having been using the Pixel since day one, I would agree to an extent... Would I go out a purchase a brand new Pixel/Pixel XL for full retail? Of course not! Only because the new iteration is just around the corner. Now, would I go buy a Galaxy S8 or an iPhone 7? No way, wouldn't even consider it! I have switched phones at least every 6 months for the past 3 to 4 years, between Android and iOS operating systems as well... Having said that, the Pixel has been the best phone and best experience that I have had to date! This is the first time that I haven't thought about what phone I want to get next, and to be honest there would have to be significant improvements for me to even get the newest iteration when it comes out this fall. This phone as just been that good. To sum things up... I would not buy the Pixel/Pixel XL right now at full retail cost, I definitely would NOT go out and buy a Galaxy S8 or an iPhone either... If you, like myself, really love the Pixel line and want to get one and don't already own one. I would suggest trying to hold out and get the newest release this fall. It's most definitely worth the wait! D13H4RD2L1V3 Google always seems to have issues with stocking ever since the Nexus days. Pretty embarrassing that it's still hard to get a hold of one after 6 months. Probably due for a small price cut soon, as newer phones roll out. me me yeah I loved Nexus back with Nexus 4, 5, 7. Now the Nexus banner is carried by the likes of Moto G, OnePlus.... H2OSKI So true. The bluetooth issues alone nearly make this phone unusable. Drops and cutout's every 20 seconds. Get this, my Pixel was fine UNTIL Google sent out "the server side" update to fix the Bluetooth issues my phone never had!!! Thanks Google. Mine is going back this week. Great camera crap bluetooth. I take pics occasionally​ but I need to use a bluetooth headset hours a day. Multiple headphones, headsets, and vehicle connections with all the same result...even in safe mode. Fail. Daishi Google shot themselves in the foot when they gussied up an HTC 10 and called it a Pixel. It is just any other Android phone and doesn't have the support behind it to justify the price. Six months along, it should be more than 50% off. William Ross Why the hell is this idiot comparing a 6 month old device to the newer releases? A year in smartphone years is a lifetime. That being said, the pixel still has the best most up to date software bar none! The camera is still among the best if not the best. And, although the 835 is a newer processor, the 821 is no slouch. GTFOH with this garbage article. And, I'll definitely be getting the next Pixel regardless of price. And, I'll sell my original on eBay for a pretty penny. And, this baby has no scratches any where. It's always been in a case and all glass has been protected by Liquid Armor. diggie Pixel is a $650+ phone built like a budget chinese phone. And sorry, Oneplus has Google beat on OS features while keeping "stock" feel. William Ross Oh here we go again with the one plus fans always hating on the pixel. If your phone is so great then why knock the pixel? I just don't get it. Just talk about how great your actual Chinese knockoff is. No need to hate in the Pixel. The one plus has little more than a cult following and mock my words, it'll never be a mainstream device. me me Android Police and a lot of its customers are hating the Pixel. The OnePlus fans just chime in. I own a OP3T. It simply works, yep even Bluetooth. When take tax into account, its about half the price. OnePlus fans biggest concern: price creep upwards. $300 becomes $350 becomes $390 becomes.... Goblin Shark Is this article from April 1st? Absolutely no one with any knowledge of phone tech recommended a Pixel, ever! Underspeced and overpriced, I doubt there's any trouble keeping them in stock they just know nobody wants them so they're not making any. Rod Under-spec'ed? Ok Underperforming? Nope Edgar Morales I honestly don't see what the problem is I purchased my pixel XL and have not to date had any issues whatsoever with it no Bluetooth issues no speaker issues nothing everyone is saying Michael Hannigan Hey, if you get a phone you love and it lasts just under a year, that's good enough. What more do you expect for a few hundred bucks. Appreciate the year you loved that thing and then replace it with a new one that you can love even more. Tom Takumi Okamoto OnePlus is a better phone maker than Google. A company not even 1% worth of Google. I really want a Pixel but it's not practical. Ionut Lala I'm sorry but that is clearly not a first generation device. Not the first from Google (made by HTC and let's not forget about the Nexus line). And not the first from HTC (for obvious reasons). Aquan Belk I wish other Android manufacturers went to stock Android. I know Samsung shines in it's own apps on top of Android but vanilla Android still is and always will be the best. Rod You heard the man, people. Don't buy a Pixel because it will have bad resale value and won't be updated for long. Instead, get a model that will have bad resale value and won't be updated for long, plus has worst performance, buggy software and worse camera performance. You're welcome. Stephonz My last Google phone was Nexus 5. As much as I like pure Android experience, Google has a bigheaded trend in phones. The price point was my biggest no no after the 5X. They don't offer as much features as the other well known Android companies.. amir80 I have a Pixel 32 gb and I really really like it. Everything works great and the camera is amazing and also the battey life. For me, the fingerprint sensor is a must. The S8 sensor is poorly located and the G6 sensor is too small. GeorgeDao123 Absolutely. The Pixel duo are 2 pieces of $#!¶. They run pure Android version and they are so slow to boot up and open apps though they are lag-free. Neru Nexus I've had a pixel since launch day. For one I don't agree with the bluetooth issues. Keep the phone up to date or use the bluetooth connect and play app to automate things. Second it is a over priced phone but so is an iPhone. The main reason real users should get a pixel is the updates. Sure you might need to learn something about that expensive piece of tech you bought and not just sit on your hands waiting for the apples or googles of the world to update your shit, but at least google gave us source code, kernel code and a unlocked bootloader. There are still updates being made for the old nexus 5, that's like 5 years old. Grab iphone 4s and tell me again about how fucking great those updates are lol. You can't even install apps like skype or whatsapp that thing is pooched. I can promise the world that even if google stops updating the pixel in 2018 there will be updated versions of the os you can manually install for years. Let's see if you can get more then one firmware update on your fancy new samsung s8. My money is on 1, then the s9 will launch a year later and samsung just won't care about the s8. rjcuk What if you want a slightly smaller phone? The S8 is 5.8" compared to the Pixel at 5". I really struggle to hold 6" phones. Even the Nexus 5X at 5.2" was too big to grip properly and comfortably. Janoo Ramachandran DON'T BUY A PIXEL. We have 2 Pixels at home. One bought early November 16 and the other end Jan 17. The one I was gifted this January, within 40 days had microphone related issues. I could not hear anyone on the phone, nor was the music being played out. They refused a replacement. My phone sat in the repair centre for 8 plus day and the mother board replaced. Have you ever heard of a new phone device of any other brand needing a mother board replacement in leads than 45 days WELL GOOGLE PHONE PIXEL NEEDED IT. The other phone bought early November 16 started having other issues last month and it wasn't recognizing the wifi. After at least 20 hours on the phone with the terrible google support, it had to be sent to the repair centre where it was kept for 2 weeks, you heard that right 16 days to be precise. Then the phone came back with a chip replaced. SHOULD YOI BUY A PIXEL EVER. :. NEVER SHOULD YOU LOOK AT GOOGLE AS A PHONE MAKER :. NEVER Nikhil I wholeheartedly concur here. I picked up a Pixel sometime around December which had to be promptly returned for a replacement as the volume rocker was rickety. The replacement didn't last long either. Within a month, the widely acknowledged microphone issues popped up and after almost 15 days of talking to the very incompetent Google support in India, their only resolution was to take the Pixel to the service center. The service center did not have the motherboard in stock (they had to bring it all the way from Taiwan) and my phone still languishes there even after 15 days of me submitting it. The phone suffers from not only just Gen-one product issues, but also terrible after sales support. Leonardo Baez Agree.... ait for the next generation THEN buy current generation cheaper. Jeremy Allan Actual customer service? You do realize that owners of a pixel get free 24/7 support any time, on a dedicated line for pixel owners? Exalm There is the same section in the settings on Nexus 5X and 6P. No idea whether it works, since there's no chat or phone support in Russia neither for Nexus nor Pixel. Cory Wilson I agree. Granted it was around a year ago I bought my 6p but the 6p didn't cost $870 either. Still don't regret that decision Impulse_Vigil Haven't really had any serious Pixel Bluetooth issues here... A handful of times (literally less than half a dozen) BT shut itself off back in Feb-March, hasn't happened again since the Play Services patch. I use Bluetooth on a daily 24/7 basis too with my ZenWatch 3, car audio, etc. I don't push it to its range limits tho. Dunno whether David's usage and issue is some sorta edge case, or range related, or whether he was speaking to the 1-2 month period when others were having more severe Bluetooth shut off issues. I do agree with the overall sentiment tho, Google hasn't made it easy to buy the Pixel and that's simply inexcusable. I haven't had to suffer thru any of the QC issues (no BT, mic, whatever issues here, knock on wood) but it seems they weren't handled super well either. To be honest I wouldn't even recommend the S8 to anyone either unless it's another geek/enthusiast, these days for most people it's simply not worth it to spend that kind dosh on a phone. I bought my mother a Moto Z Play; I'd probably point others towards that, the OP3, or an HTC One/S7 on sale. I'm super happy with my Pixel, but if there was a OnePlus 3-class device for Zoglog Having owned a pixel XL and now a s8+, I'd have to agree. Even not taking into account the questionable hardware reliability of the pixel (mine died in 5 months). Basically when I owned the pixel I loved the hell out of stock Android but I kept on wondering why I paid so much for it. Meanwhile with the S8+ the gorgeous screen makes it feel especially special and worth the price. Even though I would prefer stock Android 10000% sebastianer Pixel is just another Nexus. Like the 6P. There is no excuse, this is not their first premium phone. Still made by HTC instead of Huawei. And called Pixel instead of Nexus...and more expensive because of HTC and all the marketing costs. And..still has the shitty compass all their recent previous nexus had with a lot of topics open in Google product forums and staff giving tons of manuals about how to perfect calibrate something that doesn't retain calibration. But the main reason I wouldn't buy a Pixel...is the compass and secondly that you will get one more android update if you wait 6 months. username_not_valid How is the pixel the first 'in-house Google phone'? Its clearly and actually a slightly rehashed HTC. HTC doesn't just make it ,they designed it for all intents and purposes. Unless Googles design strategy happens to be exactly like HTCs then its not a Google phone. The Pixel is just an over priced nexus, nothing else. SOUL- Always great to see the smartphone community go from praising a phone to outright basing it just after a couple of months. Perfectly fine with my Pixel. Michael Sørensen It's just ... really boring. andy mckenzie It's a superb phone , blazing fast so processor is not an issue , amazing camera , free storage , online support has been fast and efficient in my experience, stock Android , I'd highly recommend to anyone. remister I am still using my 6P, I couldn't swallow the 1K price tag for 128GB with insurance.... Justin Field Yeah, I broke the screen on my 5x, and since I am on Fi I considered getting a pixel for about 2 seconds and ordered and new screen and fixed my phone. I will wait for the next gen or switch off of Fi.

New information published by Fortune has revealed additional information about the incident including that the two firms are Google and Facebook. The man, Evaldas Rimasauskas, allegedly impersonated an Asia-based manufacturer, Quanta Computer, that frequently contracts with both Facebook and Google. Rimasauskas is accused of sending emails pretending to be Quanta to both companies, redirecting multiple large payments. Rimasauskas also allegedly faked letters, contracts, and invoices as if they were from Quanta, even forging the signatures of various executives. Money was funneled into multiple bank accounts around the world, including in Latvia, Slovakia, and Hong Kong. Rimasauskas used these fake documents to allegedly scam Google and Facebook out of tens of millions of dollars for parts and supplies over a two-year period, from 2013 to 2015. The total amount the two companies lost is estimated at around $100 million. Facebook and Google claim to have received most or all of their money back, with a Google spokesperson saying "We recouped the funds and we're pleased this matter is resolved," and a Facebook spokesperson saying "Facebook recovered the bulk of the funds shortly after the incident." This underscores the increasing dangers of scammers and hackers, where even large international corporations are falling victim to sophisticated scams. Corporations and governments will have to develop equally sophisticated defenses if they want to avoid leaking money or secrets.

(File photo) Google is preparing to introduce an ad-blocker to Chrome browser despite fears that it would hit their online advertising revenues -- a move that has been hailed by publishers in the US and Europe, the Financial Times reported.

According to NetMarketShare -- a company that provides market share statistics for internet technologies -- Chrome is a dominant player in the internet browsing market with a near 60 per cent share. "The blocker would be likely to target certain types of ads that have been found to frustrate readers, such as pop-ups and auto-playing videos," the Financial Times report said on Sunday. Initially, it was expected that the company's ad-blocking plan was a blow to the publishers who are struggling to compete with Google and Facebook for online ad revenues. But the report said publishers are encouraged by the company's move as a way to clean up online advertising. chrome Google Ad-blocker publishers First Published: May 2, 2017, 8:58 AM IST Read full article Next Story Recommended For You Rakhee Gulzar is Unrecognizable as She Makes a Rare Public Appearance Rahul Khanna Shares Childhood Photo With Father Vinod, Brother Akshaye IPL 2017: Flying Keiron Pollard Takes a Superb Catch Against RCB Remembering Satyajit Ray: The Genius Extends Beyond Films CAT S60 Review: The Toughest Phone Money Can Buy In India Popular Deals Coolpad Cool 1 (Gold, 3GB... 10,999.00 OnePlus 3T (Gunmetal, 6GB RAM... 29,999.00 Moto G5 (3 GB, Lunar... 11,999.00 About Us Privacy Policy Disclaimer Contact Us Sitemap Complaint Redressal Advertise With Us sections India Lifestyle States Tech Politics Auto Sports iVideos Football Power Circuit Latest News Constable Booked For Trying to Run Over Man in Thane Pak Welcomes Erdogan's Offer to Help Resolve Kashmir Issue Rakhee Gulzar is Unrecognizable as She Makes a Rare Public Appearance The Mother's Day Debate: Stay in or Go Out?

By: Tech Desk | New Delhi | Updated: May 2, 2017 9:36 am Apple’s upcoming smart speaker could be priced above Amazon Echo which retails for 9. Apple’s answer to Amazon Echo and Google Home might be days away from the launch. Now, according to reliable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo (via MacRumors), Apple will announce its Siri-powered smart speaker at the company’s annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June. Apple’s smart speaker will apparently cost more than the likes of Amazon Echo and Google Home. Kuo’s note says that the speaker will have multiple tweeters, a woofer and computing power comparable to an “iPhone 6 or 6s”, according to Business Insider. The analyst further believes that Apple’s upcoming smart speaker could be priced above Amazon Echo which retails for $189 (or approx Rs. 12,121) in the US market. The speaker reportedly will have similar features  to its competitors, allowing users to stream music and control Internet of Things (IoT) around their homes. While Kuo predicted that the device will be launched at Apple’s annual developer conference, the smart speaker could be potentially pushed back to later this year. This is the not the first time we’re hearing that Apple plans to release the smart speaker in June. Last week, a prominent tipster  Sonny Dickson said that Apple could debut the smart speaker at this year’s WWDC. He said the device’s design will be inspired by the Mac Pro, and the UE Boom’s mesh styling. Dickson also said that the smart speaker will run a variation of iOS. Apparently, it’s being speculated that Apple might also add Beat’s audio tech into the upcoming smart speaker system. Apple’s plans to reveal a Siri-powered smart speaker was first revealed in May 2016,  when The Information reported that Apple could potentially launch an “Amazon Echo-like device with a speaker and microphone built-in”. Later, Bloomberg reported that the device had entered the prototyping stage in September. During the same year, CNET reported that Apple’s Siri-powered speaker would be able to detect the people who are in close proximity to the device using “on-board” cameras equipped with some sort of facial recognition software. In February 2017, however, Times reported that Apple was no longer interested in developing a smart speaker.

Opinion: Even if you can, you probably shouldn't buy a Google Pixel anymore David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/05/01 2:09pm PDTMay 1, 2017 66 Plus 1 on G+ 263 Share on Facebook 60 Share on Twitter Total Shares389 Editorials Pixel Pixel XL The Google Pixel is a notoriously hard phone to get a hold of. Persistent stock issues have plagued Google's first "in-house" handset from day one, and things really are little to no better six months after the launch event. Honestly, it's a bit embarrassing just how consistently incompetent Google seems to be at keeping a reasonable inventory of phones available for purchase. But setting that aside, as one of the Pixel's most ardent evangelists, I think there's something it's probably time for me to come clean on: Even if you could buy a Pixel today, I really think you shouldn't. The Pixel is a product with generation-one product issues. The Bluetooth performance is horrid. It's not waterproof. The bezels really are due for a shrink. I don't think the exterior coating on the black and blue variants is of a particularly high quality. The glass window gets scuffed up incredibly easily. The Snapdragon 821 is officially old news. And it doesn't support proper advanced network features across all four of the big US carriers. There are other flaws I could point to, and while none of them are too terrible, they do speak to the slightly-rushed development cycle this phone seems to have been subjected to. Sure, Google got some things astoundingly right: the performance, the camera, the larger software experience. In fact, I think the Pixel is easily the best Android smartphone ever for these strengths, at least if we're talking about me personally as a user (your mileage, obviously, may vary). But for all the great, smooth, fast, clean, pure, simple, natural, and various other adjective-members singing in the Pixel-praise cavalcade, this phone is not the one to buy right now. For starters, Google continues to ask what is an increasingly laughable amount of money for the model most of us want - the 128GB XL - at a staggering $870. Sure, Apple charges the same for an iPhone 7 Plus 128GB, but I'm under no illusion that this comparison in any way favors Google. The iPhone comes with Apple customer service (with actual stores), a longer software support period going forward, and runs no real risk of poor resale value. The Pixel? Google's online support is iffy at best, we know the phone will be unsupported by October 2018, and I have a strong feeling generation-one Pixel resale values will drop like a rock once the new phones are announced. And that really is why, if you haven't pulled the trigger on a Pixel yet, you should just wait. It's overpriced, under-supported, and competing phones like the Galaxy S8 offer a whole lot more technology for your money. The Galaxy S8+ is $20 less than a 128GB Pixel XL, and I would argue it is far and away the better smartphone value. That amazing display, brand-new Snapdragon 835 processor, jaw-dropping design and packaging, and the full support of all our American carriers' latest LTE advancements could each be a reason on its own to put the Galaxy S8 above Google's smartphone. Do I still prefer using the Pixel over the S8? Sure. But I wouldn't buy a 128GB Pixel XL over a Galaxy S8+ today. That would be, frankly, a bit silly. If Google was asking $670 and not $870, the discussion would probably change, but they aren't. You've got to pay full price, and there's no way I could recommend anyone do that. If you're still on the fence about the Pixel, let me try to push you over: wait for the next generation. I realize that this sort of thinking can devolve into a rationale that encourages you to never upgrade anything because something newer, faster, and better is constantly on the horizon. But in this case, I think it's a consideration that is worth weighing more seriously than usual. Many of the Pixel's biggest flaws relate to Google's inexperience producing a smartphone. Issues that only come up as you try to mass-produce and distribute a product with a real marketing campaign that creates real demand, and the phone gets into the hands of "real" users who aren't part of the now-derailed Nexus phone hypetrain. Inside Google, expectations were no doubt managed, realities realized, and priorities accordingly re-calibrated after this first launch. (Side note: if the Bluetooth performance on the next Pixel is as bad as the first one, I may scream, Google.) Meanwhile, the things that make the Pixel great aren't going anywhere. The next Pixel will be fast, it will take great photos, and it will offer a wonderfully unfettered Android experience. Those that make it less than great? Google is no doubt drilling down through the worst of them in order to ensure the Pixel 2 - or whatever it's called - won't make the same mistakes that the original did (waterproofing, please). And one of the primary reasons to try the Pixel in the first place - to be on the very bleeding edge - really only remains true from a software standpoint. Older phones like the Nexus 5X and 6P don't even let the Pixel have an advantage there, as they're on the same update track until around the time the next Pixel phones launch. If you absolutely need a smartphone soon and the Pixel is tempting you, ask yourself this: Can you deal with a Moto G5 Plus for six months if it means having a better Pixel down the road? While as a reviewer I have the admitted luxury of not needing to consider such things, were I in such a position, I'd have little in the way of a counterargument to offer. Sure, you'll take a resale hit on anything you buy now, but the Pixel is going to face a much, much steeper devaluation curve in that time than any budget phone. Buying a Pixel right now just doesn't make sense. I love my Pixel XL, but I'm officially done recommending the phone to friends and relatives. Instead, I'll tell them to wait, or to get the Galaxy S8 they were probably going to buy anyway. Tags editorial google pixel google pixel xl opinion pixel xl subscribe ...

Google really shot themselves in the foot with availability. My name is…. No, they shot their foot with huge bezels, with lack of waterproof, lack of dual speakers, no real camera progress compared to nexii, meh battery life, meh screen. No real selling point besides being pure android phone. This phone had iphone price but was worst on so many levels (no A10 SoC, no iphone-fast NAND, no 4yrs updates) Oneplus on the other hand........ M. Luciano Also has none of that stuff, but is cheaper? My name is…. yes, half price cheaper. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ The black screen issue kind of negates anything else ;) Michael Hannigan What's the "black screen issue"? Carson Saldanha YOU WANT THE PIXEL TO HAVE THE A10 CHIP?? BHAAAAAAAHAHAHA My name is…. No, i want it to have a cheaper price, or be better somehwere else, like the Galaxy.

Тарас Мукин You keep hating Pixel in the comments, but you only look at numbers. But they doesn't matter when it comes to Google. Software experience does. My name is…. That's a stupid argument Тарас Мукин And saying that somebody's argument is stupid without any explanation is a much smarter argument. My name is…. Would you pay 900$ bucks for Nexus 5 just because "Software experience matters"?? Carson Saldanha Nobody said they were paying just for the "software experience" Matt Tapac said that specs don't matter, the software experience does. That heavily implies that people are paying for the software experience. Carson Saldanha xD here we go again drunken_bastard Pixel and Pixel XL have better cameras and screens than any iPhone. The difference in SoC and other bits of hardware, they don't translate into any real world speed differences. Pixel also has great battery life. Perhaps some hands on time may do you some good. supersanborn Given that they continually sell out of the limited stock they have, none of what you cited matters. If they had a ginormous supply of units and THEN couldn't sell, then perhaps you would be on to something. My name is…. What was the availability in the first place? You think they produced many? No way Jose, i bet Galaxies and iphones outsold pixels by multiple times supersanborn We don't exactly know what they had hoped to produce or even what they actually produced, so your point remains conjecture. And who here is suggesting that Samsung and Apple phones didn't outsell the Pixel? My name is…. * by multiple times James Betti Sadly, Google isn't keeping the Pixel in stock because they don't care about their hardware line. Google makes most of its money through ads and personal data. It's a shame, but it explains why they discontinue successful products and barely have much in stock. Excellent phone by the way. Michael Hannigan Well, that's easy to rectify. Do like Amazon and offer the same exact hardware with "special offers" for a lower price. Then you get to see ads everywhere, even your home screen and app drawer. Pretty cool. Michael Hannigan Yes, they did. It was in the millions. Max "no real camera progress compared to nexii, meh battery life, meh screen." Ok, so you don't have a Pixel, we get it. My name is…. I'm not dumb, do you get that too? Xchris I think the consensus here is that you are talking bollocks. The pixel XL has an unbelievably good screen, one of the best battery life figures, still has the best camera out of any smartphone. Nobody who bought the pixel cares that much about any of your other points. In fact, what you are really saying is that you didn't like the pixel. Big deal! My name is…. Actually, i'm fighting the pixel in a nerdy community. Its expected that the consensus is that "i am talking bollocks". People here mainly wanna root their phones and put center clocks on status bar. they did the same with Nexii devices, its all about the software, but those phones were seriosly lacking (i used to own all Nexus devices after 4) Carson Saldanha So may I ask, what phone do you use now? My name is…. 1+3 Carson Saldanha Srsly!?!? Bruh, the OnePlus 3 has a Snapdragon 820 while the Pixel has a 821, a far better camera, better performance, and software. How is the OP3 better than the Pixel? Besides the price? I could probably understand if you had the OP3T, but no way. My name is…. You are an ignorant. 1) Check the speedtests, 1+3 is faster (because better nand) 2) Software is better on 1+3 (aosp with tiny mods) 3) Pixel has underclocked 821, thus 820 with a little bit of better battery life (1+3 has 1080p screen to tie this up) 4) 1+3 has 6gb ram (will be good for 4 years) 5) 1+3 is smaller than pixels, unbelievably thin 6) 1+3 has dash charging (world leading) 7) 1+3 has half the price 8) 1+3T is another story, far better Apply cream to the burn, son PS Yes Pixel has a better camera. Carson Saldanha Ignorance at it's finest. My name is…. Those are all FACTS, son. My name is…. Where are you, son? Jack Smith Have you ever even used a Pixel? Only Android phone i have used with zero touch lag. Can we also stop the name calling? Mason Andrew Maseda Hate to break it to you man. I own The One Plus 3T the Google Pixel the Nexus 6P and the Moto X pure edition. Lol. Guess witch one is my daily driver? The Pixel. Why? Better battery . Better cam. All around the most reliable phone. Even with my Nexus 6P I've had some issues here and there tiny ones. Like some days my battery life was abnormally shit and the next day it was great. The one plus 3T has tiny issues too. The Pixel is a phone that you wouldn't understand UNLESS YOU TRY ONE FOR A DAY. come back when you do. tansuperman Not sure why people think the pixel takes good pics. I have a pixel xl, 950xl, IPhone 7plus, and now the s8. In my opinion the pixel xl takes the worst pics. The lumia 950xl is stop dog. The pixel I can tell is just too overprocessed Michael Hannigan I think it applies mostly to low light pictures - absolutely nothing touches the Pixel in that respect - trust me. More generally, it applies to the software and hardware working together to create stunning (real) HDR pictures. But in low.light, which according to a friend of mine who is a smartphone camera freak (I am not), quality of low light pictures are what users are primarily interested in because he says "...any recent smartphone can take great pictures in daylight.". For me, I liked the flexibility of the V20 camera - not just the dual lenses, but the absolutely fantastic functions in the camera app. D13H4RD2L1V3 Um, the 821 consumes less power than the 820 at the lower clocks due to a more efficient binning process. Also, both the Pixel and OP3 use UFS 2 controllers. But on Nougat, the 3 uses F2FS for its filesystem. It's not a case of better NAND. It's a case of different filesystems. Michael Hannigan I think they should use FAT16. I miss it. Chris Rey I will say the Axon 7 is just as good as the OnePlus 3 and looks better. Suicide_Note The Pixel camera is definitely superior to what was in the 6P, and i say that as someone who currently owns them both. M. Luciano I use both on a daily basis. Agree with you 100%. So do objective measurements of the cameras. Pixel is the best on the market; 6P is decent but not great. andy_o On paper both cameras should be just short of identical, but the Pixel is so much faster in processing cause of the HVX dedicated core, plus the N6P throttles like crazy (in one of my photospheres tests in a warm room the Nexus 6 beat it every time). This is crucial especially with Google who is prioritizing computational photography probably on par or more with hardware camera specs. Also, I'm not sure if this is a hardware or artificial limitation, but HDR+ auto has completely different behavior on the Pixels. I can understand how someone who has only looked at the specs and not used a Pixel and N6P (especially in the summertime), can think that there's been "no real camera progress", but this guy is balls-deep in the "arrogance of ignorance". Michael Hannigan I think the reason for the difference in HDR+ in the Pixel is that it's" real HDR - it takes several pictures and then layers them. Other phones have taken a shortcut do doing that with one picture and it really doesn't achieve the same. Except in one case - manually setting HDR in my Note 7 gave absolutely stunning night time photos. Something I can't quite achieve with the built in software on the Pixel (but can with Photoshop). andy_o I was talking the difference between HDR+ auto in the Pixel and HDR+ auto in the previous phones. The auto behavior in the Pixel is different, but the HDR+ processing is basically the same. There's more info here: http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/11/21/deep-dive-closer-look-google-pixels-camera/#What_does_HDR_do If you feel nerdy enough I can link you to a paper on HDR+ by the Google computational photography team too :) Regarding the other phone cameras, the reason they do worse isn't exactly that they they're taking shortcuts, it's actually because they're doing it the traditional way, taking different exposures. Read the AP article linked above for details on how HDR+ is fundamentally different. Michael Hannigan You have OLED burn-in? I have about 8 hours SOT/day and don't have any. That would piss me off. Jason B Inverting colors for a bit while doing some extended reading helps. Black background with white text is easier on the eyes too. But yeah, static nav bar and notification area aren't great for OLED. There should be auto pixel shift to prevent it ... or Google should make more use of Immersive Mode. whispy_snippet Ugh. Like a broken fucking record here sometimes. Shawn Spring While some of your other points may/may not be valid, to say that the Pixel had "no real camera progress compared to nexii" just makes you sound ignorant. The S821 ISP alone would make the camera in the Pixel superior, not to mention the updated HDR algorithms. Get a Pixel owner and a 6P owner in the same room (I was both) and ask them to shoot with each others phone and see who prefers which. The 6P camera lag in HDR mode was inefficient at best and unbearable at worst. And it wasn't that long ago that OnePlus was using a broken invite system, had people lick their phones, and had a horribly gender insensitive marketing campaign. I'd probably not hold them up as the standard bearer against Google. Michael Hannigan They had people lick their phones? Why did they never ask me to do that? That's discrimination. I should have been asked to lick my phone. Brett Lewis I love my pixel after coming from a HTC 8x on Windows platform. Never liked Apple and never will. And lately after all the talk of Samsung's products (blowing up, red screens, other problems) I'm quite happy with my pixel. I don't need water proofing I'm not an idiot that takes my phone near water.. the I hardly notice the bezels after coming from a 4.3 inch 720 display.. The htc8x had one of the widest angle front cameras but I dont take selfies. This pixel does what I want and is fast doing it. And for first time experiencing Android I'm quite happy with buying this with the newest and best version available. TheHater So only idiots take their phones near water? I bet if you had a water resistant phone, you'd take it near water. Michael Hannigan What about the toilet? Who doesn't read the news when sitting on the shitter? Mariano Moreira I would definitely agree in terms of the Pixel XL vs iPhone 7 plus comparisons (Non-32GB model) Comparing the base iPhone 7 vs base Pixel...the iPhone 7 base had(has) slow Nand performance from what I have witnessed. The 32GB iPhone 7 vs base 32GB Pixel (5") seems like a closer comparison where the compromise is better battery life on the Pixel, faster Nand, and better screen. Again, I concur that looking at the Pixel XL vs iPhone 7 Plus leans more heavily towards Apple especially when comparing the 128GB models. Michael Hannigan If you buy from the Google store, they are carrier agnostic - absolutely 0 carrier bloatware. Mariano Moreira No. I have a Google Play(Bootloader unlocked) purchased Pixel. Normally used on Sprint or At&t. When I activate on Verizon: to get Vo-LTE calling with Verizon SIM and certain carrier settings it does a software update switching the phone over to the Verizon specific software build. If it was truly Carrier-agnostic it wouldn't force a Carrier specific Software build onto my non-Verizon model Pixel. Michael Hannigan You must have either bought it from Verizon or screwed something up. An unlocked phone doesn't suddenly become carrier specific like you describe Mike John Quincy Adams I don't one person who owns or says ’I sure wish I had a OnePlus.' Michael Hannigan I have - when I had the OnePlus One. Many people asked me about it. You can't deny that OnePlus phones offer an unbeatable value. They don't skimp on specs and sell for half the.price they should. asrat_24 I get you're trying to make fun of that guy but don't make ignorant statements while trying to do it. Oneplus makes good phones and people are interested enough nowadays to say that. Major Sceptic Agree on all points , a mid range device with a flagship price , perhaps Google will adjust the prices on the 2 ? for a company trying to expand it's phone sales it's going a funny way about it . Artem Russakovskii Well, usually at that point you start seeing significant discounts, but the Pixel is a misnomer in that regard to due to low stock and high demand. Max Exactly, I would revise that affirmation to state: "I've always felt once we are less than 6 months from the new iteration, it's a mistake to buy the existing product *at full price*." supersanborn I'll grant there's a case to be made for some phones where waiting can result in substantial discounts (especially from HTC/LG/etc). Probably a little of my bias sneaks in here. I prefer to have the newer device, and if I waited 6 months post-launch, it probably means I myself need to wait until the next launch. Max I'm with you there, I usually buy a phone at launch or a couple of months later at most but remember that we aren't regular customers, that's why we read and comment on this site ;). For many people out there it makes more sense to buy a phone six months after release if it comes with a nice worthy discount. M. Luciano This ^^ supersanborn Agreed, for some, shaving $100-200 off the price is all that matters. I usually caution folk pretty hard in the last 3 months before the new iteration drops if they have any form of new feature/size/color envy. supersanborn And yeah, I'm nowhere near the "normal" consumer :-) needa Supposed to be picking up a 32gb XL (Google) for $450 near mint in a couple hours. I might not get it, but a killer deal nonetheless. M. Luciano Smash that deal :) Very nice. needa A few little scratches on the back glass. Profit.

The lowest I've seen on Swappa was $695 for a black XL. supersanborn True. I usually find that the discounts are kind of on the "meh" side though until we hit release of new product. I always basically tell folks that you either buy it at launch until about 6ish months post-launch, and if you've held off that long, you should just wait until next launch and either buy the old product at a big discount or buy the new one. Matt I believe your use of misnomer was a bit of a misnomer. Artem Russakovskii I did use the wrong word, you're right. el_smurfo That's why I just picked up a 6p last year for $400. Most expensive smartphone I've ever bought, but the full release price was just not in my budget. Karly Johnston Battery issues? MisterAlex Maybe an anomaly... but not a misnomer. paxmos Where is this high demand you guys talk about?, I have yet to see a pixel in anyone's hand M. Luciano Really? I know over a dozen people who have or had them. paxmos Yep...I see lots of iPhones and Sammy's, even one Blackberry Z30, have only seen a pixel in the Verizon store. M. Luciano I feel like a nerd owning 4 Major Sceptic It does seem to have more of an enthusiast following , no shortage of pixels in my region , the usual brands , apple, Samsung, still seem to have the sales , I know not one person that has a pixel or wants one , and I think Google only has itself to blame on that front, Re : the cost of a pixels . Goblin Shark Finally, someone who knows what they're taking about - my head is just shaking in disbelief reading what these marshmallow brains that think they know about phones are saying on this comment thread lol Daishi Exactly. I have yet to see a Pixel in the wild. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ To be fair, HTC isn't used to such a high demand for their phones. Google unfortunately paid the price Daishi This made me LOL! A post full of WIN for sure!! Zoglog Actually it's probably because of all the RMA's they've gotten JD Thought that was obvious. syxbit I wonder whether we shouldn't wait for Pixel + 2. The next Pixel may technically be the first Google made product (current Pixel is made by HTC), so it's possible the Pixel 2 will have first gen problems. Still, I still have the N6P (after I scoffed at the Pixel price and refused to buy it), so I going to be looking for a phone soon. Good_Ole_Pinocchio HTC is also manufacturing the Pixel 2. Word on the street. Daishi That's too bad. I'll avoid this this phone as well... Captain On! Well, technically the iPhone is made by Foxconn, so... Don't expect Google to actually build their own facilities to produce hardware. Carson Saldanha Pretty sure they'll still be using HTC. Might have more control over the design this time around though. 4Ui812 The availability issue is a play out Nintendo's handbook. Good_Ole_Pinocchio 100% agree with the entire article... Do I want the Pixel Software Experience and Camera? Yes... But not when the new version is a few months away thag would probably fix all the issues I see posted on this site ever so often...starting with the Bluetooth issues. I got an S8... Because it's the only phone thay makes sense to me right now..... I'll see what Google is doing in the fall Max Johnson If the Moto G5 Plus had NFC I would have no problem making it my Android daily driver for the next 6 months. wade_county Moto Z Play and OP3/OP3T are other options with NFC. shadowx360 I used to buy 1 generation old Nexus devices to get around the cost issue, but it seems the 5X and 6P both are plagued by serious phone-killing issues. Now that warranty is up on nearly every used 5X/6P, buying used is like trying to navigate a minefield. I don't really trust 1st generation Pixel to not have serious issues either. I'd never use a non-Pixel/Nexus device but I can't buy a Pixel XL knowing Samsung offers so much better hardware at a similar price. wade_county My advice is getting the next OnePlus phone or picking up a used OP3/OP3T. AndrewGM I bought a used Pixel in good shape on eBay, as I couldn't get one from Google Store (already had a wireless provider). Switched from an iPhone 6s, after using almost every iPhone model since and including the original. Much better camera on the Pixel, especially closeups and in low light, and much easier to use overall (especially Contacts vs. iOS), as I've used mostly Google apps for a long time. I like the Google keyboard much better and the Android interface. I'm definitely satisfied with the Pixel and have no real iPhone regrets. It's true there are more apps for the iPhone, but that doesn't matter because the core apps are available on Android too. The only app I miss is Enlight, for photo editing. The one Pixel issue I agree with is the relatively poor resale value vs. iPhones (I assume). Carson Saldanha May I suggest Snapseed for photo editing? (It's developed by Google) Also, do you miss iMessage/FaceTime or is that really a con? AndrewGM Will check out Snapseed, thanks. I've been using Google Photos to lightly edit pics. The Pixel camera is so good that I often don't edit (for Instagram/FB uploads), especially if the light and composition are already good. I don't miss iMessage at all. I had to turn it off and all that stuff for my phone number when I switched, but I'm texting away every day. Emoticons seem to work fine. I don't even think about iMessage. FaceTime has been replaced with Duo for my family members, including those on iPhone. Seems to work fine. And I can share location with family members via Google Maps. I guess that brings up privacy issues vs. using Apple products, but not sure it makes a real-world difference. Battery life, btw, seems pretty good (I charge the phone overnight only). The call quality is a little less than iPhone, maybe, but overall acceptable. AndrewGM Will add that I have had the Pixel for 2 months and use it daily. I like the screen on the Pixel (or at least it never bothers me), and the issue about the "chin" at the bottom being big is a non-issue to me. I don't notice it and in fact hold the phone sometimes there, which is arguably convenient. If the phone continues to hold up, I'll be a customer for Pixel 2 eventually. Eric I was ready to jump to the Pixel XL after returning my second Note 7, but Google never gave me the opportunity to give them my money. Carson Saldanha xD My name is…. It was never a good device. thank you for finally admitting that. Andrew I don't think that's what the author is saying... My name is…. Someone had to be crazy to buy a pixel in the first place. I was bashing on that device from day one. Author, months later, says that the phone is no good. It was never good. Carson Saldanha Lord, would you just chill? Tr3ple I think he's retarded, gotta be it, lol. Must be it actually. Carson Saldanha troll by far Suicide_Note Except that's not at all what the author said, so you're either: A) trolling, B) incredibly dumb, or C) both of the above. Тарас Мукин Of course there's no point in buying Pixel for full price now. And there's more: there's no point in buying any device for it's starting price when it's 3 months old — tech gets old really fast today. And that's the whole point of not buying something at day one — everything gets much cheaper very fast. Samsungs do, LGs too. But Pixel for some reason didn't. And Nexuses were like this too. So — only buying Google devices right after release makes sense. Or buying them unofficially and cheaper. Sad, but true. sraj49 I always like and respect your articles. You put your views straight forward. But I tend not to agree with the tone and content of this article completely. I am living in Home of full Apple products and I own a Pixel XL. I love the Pixel in all aspects. Yes there are room to improvements which is true for everyone. Apple products are well designed, well built. As regards sorry gone are those days when Apple sorry was at is best which was until iPhone 4s/ iPhone 5. Now after the warmth period it is the same as Pixel. I going Pixel after sales support very good. I definitely agree with you on the most inefficient handling of supplies and also this is not the time to buy since meet models are coming. Just to add, I get sick when people say that the Pixel phones are not made by Google but by HTC. Everyone outsources manufacturing. Most of the phone are made by Foxcon staying from Apple. All phone manufacturers only design the hardware, software and the manufacturing is outsourced. Good_Ole_Pinocchio The HTC point that keeps coming up comes from the fact that Google didn't really dsign much hardware hete. They just used HTC parts. It's not the same as hardware being designed by apple then manufactureres elsewhere. andy_o I think he's right on that point. Google support may or may not be good, but it's online only. Apple support is famously good. For instance, the recent fixes for iPhone 6s battery problems. I booked an appointment, went into the store, they told me it would be a bit, went to a coffee shop, they emailed me, picked it up. Another time my iPad mini 2 mute switch broke. Again, appointment, go in the store, got it actually just exchanged on the spot. Google simply cannot do that. JohnyNoLegs What android phones have you owned prior to the pixel? And yes it's a HTC phone through and through. Scofabear Shots fired! I even dumped my 6P for a Moto z play. No regrets Futbolrunner Same here! That 808 was a lag fest. I even got the S8+ but returning it because it can't touch the Play's battery life. Dominic D I just bought a Pixel a month ago. I still would recommend it if you get one for fairly cheaply on swappa. It's awesome. Brian Demodulated My last 3 phones have been Nexus. Each has been less reliable than the last. I love how hackable they are but I think my next phone will be a Samsung Galaxy. Carson Saldanha Elaborate? Wdym by "less reliable" What issues? Brian Demodulated My Samsung Galaxy Nexus was incredible and still works today. My Nexus 5 was garbage - two broke within 1.5 years. My 6P is quirky - it doesn't charge on my home PC and although my wife's updated to 7.1.2 mine says it's up to date at 7.1.1. Tr3ple Get a pixel then, Samsung lol. Brian Demodulated I have my 6P another year. I'll see what's available next year when my contract is up. JohnyNoLegs Bootloops, dodgy updates, requires factory resets, breaks features, slow bug fixes. M. Luciano No offense, but you are not going to increase stability by going to Samsung. Brian Demodulated My old Samsung Galaxy Nexus was the best, highest quality, most reliable phone I ever owned. LG and Huawei's Nexus phones were less stable for me. M. Luciano I had a few of those.. they weren't as reliable. But probably because I did bad things to them. Brian Demodulated I rooted mine, loaded hacky ROMs, and carried it with me everywhere I went for 3 years. The USB and audio cables are a little loose now but otherwise it's saved me when my later Nexus phones crapped out on me. Vitali Galaxy nexus had clean stock rom, it is just Google's clean soft in a Samsung physical device and not with samsung's os Brian Demodulated Every Nexus has the clean stock ROM. It's one of the top reasons why I get them. JohnyNoLegs Going Pixel sure doesn't increase stability. It's less stable than my Note 4/Note 7. Vitali Agree with M. Luciano, but people try should move to Sony. Lookup at speed test videos of their Xperia XZs, it has beaten all smartphones by now, including the Pixel. All the biased big reviewers out there will never tell you the truth, stop thinking the S8 is the best phone in the world.. I recommend you to wait for their Xperia XZ Premium it will have sd835! After you see the XZs speed, I promise you it may be the fastest phone even in 2018. Suicide_Note No. Just...no. Vitali *A wild 8 year old fanboy comment appears* Brian Demodulated Speed isn't that important to me. I've heard bad things about Sony's flavour of Android and that it's bloaty. Vitali So you heard wrong, their software is one of the bests out there, and im talking from experience.. And Samsung have so clean and fast Android that it is just unbelievable.. Where do you get all that info from?? Vitali So you heard wrong, their software is one of the bests out there, and im talking from experience.. And Samsung have so clean and fast Android that it is just unbelievable.. "I've heard.." Where do you get all that info from?? Suicide_Note TW is much better than it used to be, but it's hardly clean and fast. Brian Demodulated I work in a large IT department. One of my buddies told me about it. He said Sony's Android UI was all over the place and annoying to use, and that his handset was 2 major versions behind the latest version of Android OS. dtox Lol don't listen to him, xperia phones are absolute trash. dtox LOL xperia = garbage D13H4RD2L1V3 Um, I'm not entirely sure. Not that I'm ragging Sony, but they haven't exactly been selling for a reason. Even Sony themselves know. I don't hate Sony phones. I personally think they're understated, solid offerings. Problem was that they were really overpriced. After seeing the XZs and XA1, seems like their pricing may have become more logical. We'll see how it goes. I'm personally hoping the XZP may even be a solid device. Not that I'll buy one but if the price is right, it'll be significantly easier to recommend. JSo Experiences differ from person to person. But It's odd the luck you have had with the Nexus devices. I've had the Galaxy Nexus, Nexus 5 and now the Nexus 5X and I have never had an issue with any of them. JohnyNoLegs No battery issues with 5X? My wifes upgraded to 7.1.1 and has never been the same, bluetooth is slow and laggy, and the battery barely gets 1.5-2 hours SOT after it used to get close to 3. Michael Hannigan Dude, you're talking about a crusty old obsolete phone. And unless you are happy getting 2 hours of battery time, you should pry the wallet open and buy something current. Complaining about your old phone won't make you feel better. Replacing it with a working, current phone that's not past it's expected useful life will. JohnyNoLegs Dude, wth are you talking about. It's a 1.5 years old. From new it was getting 4-5, right up until 7.1.1 update. Roy My 6P is the most reliable phone ever. And I had Samsung and HTC. Duder12 The last Nexus phones had bum processors from qc. royrov My Nexus 6P kissed the asphalt a couple of weeks ago, so I bought a perfect Pixel XL second hand (used 3-4 months). Its better, no regrets here. Faster and better battery, hell even snapchat is snappy on it! Tr3ple Exaclty lol, people saying the pixel isn't an upgrade to the 6p are delusional lol. They all like to hate on it u til they get one and realize how good of a phone it is. And all the bugs I've been seeing on the net are nowhere to be found and I had mine for 5-6 months now bekifft I know it's an upgrade. It's just not much of an upgrade for an enormous amount of money. Tr3ple My 6p had serious issues, I went and got a s7 egde(big mistake), the price I paid was well worth it. I'm still financing my s7 egde while I'm using a pixel, this is how much I love this phone. destinyhud I will still buy one Michael Tran If I could give you a phone for free but you had to keep it and use it and couldn't sell it. Which phone would it be? M. Luciano 128 GB Pixel XL, black supersanborn My 128GB Pixel XL in black. At least until the 2 comes and **hopefully** adds waterproofing, 600Mhz support, 4x4MIMO for T-Mobile. If you're reading, Pixel team, let's talk! Orlando aka Pixel XL Samsung Galaxy S8+ blue Tr3ple Gimme a 128 gb pixel XL black any day keithzg The bezels really are due for a shrink. Boy are you gonna rue this when the second-gen comes out and the bezels are the exact same ;) M. Luciano I sorta hope they are :) keithzg You animal! (But honestly, this is why choice is good. I find the desire for those top and bottom bezels incomprehensible, but I can entirely understand that not everyone would feel the way I do, particularly if routinely holding phones very differently.) M. Luciano I just want SOME bezels. They don't need to be huge. Just want a place to put my thumbs when holding it sideways. It's a good place for speakers IMO. Carson Saldanha Nah, to be fair, I think Google's definitely not planning on keeping them the same size if they've listened to the reviews. keithzg I mean, if they'd listened to reviews of many other phones before they put out the Pixels they would have known that too---including, for instance, the previous two generations of Nexus phones . . . So it seems likely that either (a) they know of the opinions of the commentariat and disagree, or (b) they felt technically they couldn't do it. I'm personally hoping it was somehow just (b) but they used (a) to convince themselves that it was an okay sacrifice, but that they won't have to make the same sacrifice again this year and they'll allow themselves to change up the design. But I'm not gonna bet too much money on that. Carson Saldanha Whoa, you lost be there with all those "a's" and "b's" xD Shawn Spring I think its pretty well known at this point that the time frame between when Google's negotiations w/Huawei fell through and when they picked the deal up with HTC was the cause of the "let's use the leftover A9 shells" bezel issue. So more (b) than (a) assuredly. ikeofkc If they do. Peoples' thumb muscles are going to be screwed if they use the pixel 1 handed, constantly trying to reach the back button. The chin makes one handed use possible keithzg See, that's what I mean about different folks and different strokes. I've never noticed it being of any help with my Nexus 6P, for me the top and bottom bezels are completely useless. bekifft If they actually put something useful there, like a front facing stereo speaker, I would be totally fine with that. keithzg Dammit, don't you go making me miss the Nexus 6 again! Michael Hannigan I want them to be bigger. I want to be able to lean on mine when I am standing in line at a movie. MadMartigan I am constantly amazed by the short memories. The author thinks it likely they are likely to have a better launch of P2? They do give the obvious impression that they believe the Pixel to be their first swing and a miss... Funny how quickly we forget, well, nearly every other device Google has ever tried to sell. I personally loved my 4, 10, 5, 6, and 6. But I cannot, while keeping a straight face, argue that one should expect anything better from them regarding inventory management this time around. How many times does Google have to fail on inventory management before we start pointing and laughing at the people who constantly say, "They'll get it right this time, for sure." Don't get me wrong - I would absolutely love it if Google proved me wrong on the P2. I just won't believe it until I see it. //dons flameproof suit// A'ight, I'm ready. Fire away... M. Luciano This is their first swing and a miss, but only because the shortages are for very different reasons than prior devices they sold on behalf of other OEM's. MadMartigan Who...who do you think made the Pixels? M. Luciano Google is the OEM for the Pixel phones (and tablets, and laptops, etc). HTC is the factory putting the phones together. It's a totally different legal and business agreement, and essentially means that Google has to supply most of the components, contracts, contacts, etc. and HTC is essentially an assembly line. On Nexus phones, the OEM was Samsung, or LG or Huawei, etc. and they actually designed and produced the phones, in partnership with and input from Google. Completely different. For those, the partner was able to do all the contracting and sourcing; HTC isn't doing all the work for Google this time. MadMartigan So you don't believe HTC designed the Pixel. Got it. That's all I needed to see. M. Luciano Not sure what that means, but ok. Google is now the OEM, that's what I am saying. Another Scott Nice post. I hemmed and hawed about a Pixel XL 128 for 6 weeks last fall and finally decided I just couldn't do it. Besides the fact that it was impossible to get from Google, I just couldn't justify the price. I decided to finally replace my LG Nexus 4 (roughly $350 new) with a new T-Mobile LG V10 from B&H in November for $330 and am quite pleased. (It would have been $300 a week or so later.) I added a Samsung EVO 128 GB SDHC card for it for $40 or so. I miss the Nexus timely updates a great deal, but I can't see spending a kilobuck on a phone to get it - especially for only a 2 year OS upgrade availability. I hope Google gets the Pixel 2 right, but maybe they figure having a "premium" phone for evangelists is good enough so they won't feel any pressure to make it available (or cut the price). Cheers, Scott. fijisiv The Galaxy S8+ is $20 less than a 128GB Pixel XL Just wow. M. Luciano Right? The Pixel is by far a better value at those prices. 128 GB storage over 16, metal over glass body, better software, better security, better camera, guaranteed to be up to date for 3 years... Samsung has some great components, but as a package, Pixel seems to keep ahead at this point. Matt I believe the S8+ is 64G and has a microSD slot. M. Luciano I think you're right. IMO that makes the Pixel better. Do you prefer less with expandable option? 03grunt I live in the mountains of NC and went back to Verizon once they brought back unlimited data and luckily the local Verizon store had a Pixel XL. I think it's pretty sad that in ~ 18 months the Pixel will be EOL. M. Luciano Luckily, it won't be. Nexus and Pixel devices are guaranteed to be fully up to date for 3 years; not 2. 2 years of major updates and 3 years of security updates = 3 years of being fully up to date. Sir_Brizz That's not entirely true. They are only guaranteed to be on the latest version for 2 years. It's unlikely it will be any different than the Nexus 6 in this regard (which didn't get 7.1 but is still getting monthly security updates). M. Luciano The Pixel and Pixel XL released October 4, 2016. They're guaranteed to be fully up to date until 10/31/2019. That's 1121 days, or 3.07 years. Sir_Brizz No. You are wrong. They are only guaranteed version updates until October 2018. The Nexus 6 was guaranteed the same thing until October 2016. It did not get Android 7.1 even though it continues to get monthly security updates. What this means is that the Pixel will get at least Android 9.0 but that doesn't guarantee it will get 9.1 or 9.2 or anything else past that. It just means it will get 9.0 and monthly security updates to 9.0 for an additional year. M. Luciano I get what you're saying, but it also launches on the latest update. So using the Pixel, it launches with N, will get O after a year, will get P after a year and then is not guaranteed to get Q. Are we really going to get a Q? So during each of those three updates, N, O and P, it on the latest OS and getting monthly security updates. 2 years of updates, so long as it includes the 2nd major OS update, translates to three full years. Ever since they started the annual number and letter update, we're essentially talking about a single API version update per year (2016 had 2, including the one you're referencing which impacted Shamu). Sir_Brizz I've already pointed this out twice: look at the Nexus 6 for a first hand example of how this is going to work. The Nexus 6 will not be on the latest version of Android for three years because it is already not on the latest version of Android despite getting monthly security updates. 03grunt Thanks for clarifying! Chris Kiederer As a Nexus 5X/project Fi user, right now the Pixel is my only choice if my Nexus decides to blow up like many before it. I really hope this Android one rumor heading to the US is true, as it would give project Fi subscribers more than just a really expensive option to stay on the plan Andye82 But exactly one year from today it will be still extremely difficult if not impossible to get your hands on pixel 2 Mix "Persistent stock issues have plagued Google's first "in-house" handset from day one..." I am on my 3rd phone and I still wonder, every time I use it, if it will be like my last two phones. I have phone PTSD! Google should just pull a Nintendo and just stop producing and move on to the 2 but not fuck it up. John Doe Great job on the article, now I will be waiting for the editorial on Google's software update policy LoL PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Google's inexperience producing a smartphone They had great experience running Motorola. Ammar "Sure, Google got some things astoundingly right: the performance, the camera, the larger software experience" To be honest, these are the only reasons why I'd ever get a Pixel over any other Android phone. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ I agree with some of Radar's points as well as teh main one as I've *never* recommended the XL because I know that the vast majority of people are sheep-like followers and/or technophobes, and I defifnitely don't want part of the onus for a technophobe's major purchase that they're going to rue the second that an iPhoner mocks them. The Pixel sells itself to PowerUsers on its own merit, which, AEB the popularity of inferior and/or questionable top-sellers, clearly supports my previous assertions. JPLoureiro Deciphering of your sentences will commence............. now. Futbolrunner What? Marty I never was going to buy an HTC Pixel. Don't like HTC and the build quality doesn't deserve such a high price. jawsnnn My SOs Pixel is probably the buggiest Google phone I have used till date. The Google Assistant, voice search are consistently broken and the phone doesn't offer much else in way of justifying it's price. Will definitely buy an OEM phone next. Google's hardware experiment is dead for me. Tim Harman I wish I'd read this 2 weeks ago! Oh well. I've got a Pixel now and I do love it. I live in NZ and the version I ended up with is the American one, which means that while it supports all my LTE bands, it doesn't support Carrier Aggregation on the bands used here. So that's my excuse for why I simply MUST HAVE the P2 when it's released. Damian Stuart Wow, what a load of crap! The Pixel is a superb phone with issues affecting small numbers of devices. I have one, after moving away from the Samsung range. I have had no issues and as I don't ever intend to take a phone swimming haven't got a single complaint about it. But haters gonna hate. sebastianer @David Ruddock Don't forget the terrible compass. If you grab an iPhone 5S and a Pixel. Open Google Maps in both of them. An you start walking trough dense downtowns the whole day (closing / opening maps at different places). You will see that the Pixel compass accuracy is constantly changing every time you open maps and is a total mess while the 5S is perfectly accurate after 1-2 seconds and less than one step. I hope the next Pixel has a completely new sensor...or compass or whatever. Last 3-4 Google Phones were a mess. I think the last Google phone with more or less good compass was the galaxy nexus but I can't even remember now TechGuy22 i'm selling mine soon since i know i can sell it around 600 dollars and it's the 128GB wjrandon So glad I kept my Nexus 6P for a second year... and look at those rock solid resale values. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9d5926ba5094521287d1d54e2476d3852462178bdf74a16166f94742b435213c.jpg TechGuy22 i sold mine for 500 dollars and i bought it used too lol that's how i managed to get the XL 128GB eric messenger It depends on what phone your coming from. For most android users it is a great phone with a great camera. If your coming from an iPhone the pixel is the first great alternative to an iphone. The on device support is actually awesome and they are very quick with support issues. I am used to Nexus devices plagued with serious issues that you had to work around and while they were great phones for the price I felt they all suffered (maybe not the 6P). Anyway the point is pixel raised the bar for Android and brought it up to par with Apple. It's probably still worth buying if you have to upgrade, and you can just get the pixel 3 in 2019 or 2020. Sean You can say this about any phone at the moment....wait for next gen. As a Project Fi user I am waiting on a phone that has the cell radio to take advantage of T-mobile's new 600mhz band they are quickly rolling out...and NO, it cant be done with a software update on any phone. me me "quickly rolling out"? The spectrum is sold but not available yet as the current user vacates.... Sean NOT TRUE....they are rolling it out in areas NOW where the old TV stations have already vacated the band. Google is your friend. me me finally, you realize it was crap, was always, still now, only thing now is you changed. Never worth the money, specs so-so for the price. Islam Google Pixel poor use of space. over-priced. BS Sean People that actually OWN one dont agree........ TechGuy22 i agree and i have one. sadly, it just stopped caring about the bezel since there's nothing i can do to make it look better VAVAMk_2 6P user here with a new battery happily waiting it out for Pixel 2. Sean Boot loop much? Ernie I have had my Nexus 6p since day one of the release. I have been lucky not to have encountered the boot loop or battery problems others have reported. I love my Nexus 6p. Hope it will get Android O. Phone_Addiction Pixel 2 probably going be the same story. Google will never learn. Dean F Marsh I love my Pixel XL! Invest in a good quality case and enjoy the phone. It's really pretty decent and for a few minor quirks mentioned, and none that I have experience yet, I can't be happier. From Nexus, HTC, Samsung, to Pixel XL, this has been the best so far. Ailín Ó’S I live in Ireland and Pixel isn't even available here yet which is odd given we were a launch country for Nexus 5x/6p but hey ho. Rick Schoonmaker This is just what I like to read after getting banged by Google and Huawei with the 6P bootloop issue 1 year and 2 days (read 2 days out of warranty) after buying and being told that my only option is to buy a new phone. So after being without a phone for a week, I had to buy a Pixel XL even though I really didn't want it and especially at the ridiculous price ($860 for 32Gb.. are you effing kidding?). Matt Definitely. I got a pixel XL the very first morning when it was available in local store. Great phone, camera, software. 2 months later, the phone began to behave crazily--extra hot, microphone malfunction. Called Google support for like 10 times and had it replaced, then I put the brand new replacement on local trade platform without hesitation. Google-brand is attatractive, but does not worth that rediculous amount of money. I can get a even better performed oneplus counterpart for almost half price. Anyway, I am on my moto x 2014 with lineage os 14 and i am pretty happy. It is sufficient for me to deal with my daily work. And I also suggest to wait for the release of more flagships from variant companies to have more flexible and reasonable options. Spinkick Google seems to not be able to follow through on anything these days. It just seems like if its not sexy or cool and needs actual work, they cant be bothered. Maybe they will release another chat app in the meantime.. 2 Men-E I want the Pixel 2 XXL (Taimen). It better exist as a 5.6"+ screened device. Philip Although if you're with TMobile. It's significantly cheaper to buy the Pixel, and get your money's worth. Granted the Pixel is guaranteed two years of support, it matches with TMobile promotion pay credit time. h4rr4r They offer a discount? I thought it was just financing. Philip Yep. $325 in TMobile bill credits over two years. Which is when the Pixel 3 will be out. So you buy a Pixel, get refunded about half of the cost. And then you're ready to upgrade to the third generation. belac77 shhh, David, I just listed my Pixel for sale on Swappa! ;) Mason Andrew Maseda This entire article is just terrible and written by someone just mad they don't have one. M. Luciano lol he got one the week after I did. He's had one. Adrianus Bratanata Supply and demand. As long as there is bigger demand than supply they don't need to reduce the price drunken_bastard I disagree. All the pros you mentioned for the Pixel -- pure Android experience, performence, camera, etc -- those are all the reasons why the Pixel and Pixel XL is still the best smartphone on the market. Worried a new one is going to come out? Happens with every flagship, every year. This one doesn't have the lastest SoC? I challenge you to demonstrate real world differences in actual speed versus the Galaxy S8, which is a gorgeous handset that yet again is crippled by bloated software and long standing issues that never seem to get addressed. You cite support potentially ending in October 2018 for software updates, but that's still a longer window than any other Android flagship, and you get them day one, which Samsung and LG don't. A smartphone is more than the sum of it's parts. It's an experience. I feel on that quality alone, the Pixel and Pixel XL are the best representations to date. NeMoDoSeZ I was going to buy a 128gb Pixel XL but due to not being available I ended up waiting and purchasing a Galaxy S8+. I'm now glad things ended up the way they did because I'm loving my S8+. Rod Until Android 8 is released. Then you'll like: fuck Samsung man! My U$xxx phone is outdated, goddamnit! Owen Iverson I hate the world of tech. We've now gotten used to NEEDING the latest thing IMMEDIATELY. Its why companies like Microsoft, Adobe, and Autodesk have switched to monthly/yearly subscriptions so you have to pay for the rest of your life. "The Bluetooth performance is horrid." What metric, speed? Connectivity? "It's not waterproof." Not sure that waterproof is a common trait among all high-end phones just yet. "The bezels really are due for a shrink." I've never used a bezel-less phone, where do you pick it up or hold it? Does your finger trigger anything on the edges? "The Snapdragon 821 is officially old news." What are you running where 1) you see lag and 2) that it's an actual problem. Maybe people are replacing consoles with their phones just like they're replacing their DSLRs with their phones? "it doesn't support proper advanced network features across all four of the big US carriers." What are these advanced network features? Anyway, I know it's a phone blog, so ... D13H4RD2L1V3 Well, he means that since its successor isn't far off, and that the Pixel is still not easy to get hold of, you might be better off waiting, since the Pixel is also selling at full price still. Edward jh How can the camera be great I mean what about the pixel camera lens flare issue plaguing 1000's of users. Margaritas Ante Porcos Pixel was a disaster. The worst phone for that price. I understand some of you got the Stockholm syndrome. But some of us see the clear picture. Google simply lost this round with both hands down. Dan Yurman My Google Pixel seems to have a mind of its owns. Here's what it does without my asking it - 1. shuts down randomly and has to be restarted by holding the power button and lower end of the volume rocker for about 15 seconds; 2. randomly starts different pieces of software including a suspiciously high frequency of instances of Google Play Music, which I have since disable, 3. Starts the flashlight from the pull down menu if the phone is placed face down on a shiny flat surface, 4 And randomly starts other programs after unlocking the phone with a pin. On the plus side the camera does good work and the phone is easily held in one hand and scrolled with fingers from the same hand while eating hit wings with the other. :-) Ray I'm very glad I read this article. I was on the fence - and almost pulled the trigger the other day but very glad I didn't now. I'll wait for the next gen and hopefully it's a much better piece of kit - and possibly cheaper. lomsha Whaaaat, you don't say. rockon999 My 2015 Moto X PE's display stopped functioning properly and I needed a new device to *function* in my daily life. So I bought a pixel, yesterday. To address your complaints... I never use Bluetooth on a phone, I'm getting a case, I'll hate the speakers (but I really only use headphones), I'm no bezel snob, and finally... waterproofing? My Moto X PE was waterproofed and I can honestly say it never aided me in one single way. Sure, it felt great using the phone in the rain that one time. But I'm fairly certain an encased pixel can survive that. I know it is probably a horrible value, but I really don't want to deal with buying a $200 phone now, selling it later for $100, and then buying a new $900 phone in a few months. I don't have time to constantly be reselling and selling my devices and I don't have a spare $100 to just throw around on a device. Slurms Mckenzie Seriously have been saying most of what this article is about since day one. I have a pixel XL and I've hated it since receiving it. It's not worth what Google asks when everything that is offered can be had for half the money (quick updates not included) for that asking price it should at least offer sd card support which is something even the most basic phones have. I've been using Nexus phones since the beginning (skipped the 6) and the problems with them were expected as it was a budget friendly phone but if you want to charge premium pricing don't use cloth for your ear piece cover, have dual speakers, and for God's sake don't make deals with the devil (Verizon) to lock down MIMO as a carrier specific feature when every damn phone is capable of and and most carriers are as well F*** you Pixel XL you sack of shit what a waste of 800 bucks Rod Best camera Google photos unlimited backup at original resolution Best performance Lowest touch latency of all Android phones "Just" that. micahthomas Basically all you're saying is wait if a new version is going to be released in 6 months. Might as well just say that, doesn't really have anything to do with if it's iPhone or Android. JG I was about to order my mother a 32GB Pixel a week or so ago to replace her Nexus 5X. I recently discovered the glass of its camera lens has a pretty decent crack in it. It doesn't seem to affect pictures - yet... But we're planning a fairly photogenic trip this summer and I figured the Pixel has a better camera and has unlimited free full resolution Google Photos uploads so... But as I was about to click the "Add to Cart" button, I thought we're not all that far from the expected October release of the Pixel 2. I'm sure mom wouldn't mind being a generation behind, but... derk p just replace the housing on hers. i bought a white one but then wanted a blue back... was cheap on ebay and is very easy to snap on and snap off dizel123 Relatively speaking we're not too far from October of next year for the Pixel 3. Or October 2019 for the Pixel 4... toast I never buy Apple, and I never buy Samsung. But both of their hardware just feel slicker than the Pixel. As the article says, knock a few hundred off the price, and I'd be a keen buyer, mainly for the camera and fast OS updates, and Google "Purity". I'll wait and see how the upcoming Moto Z and X phones turn out. Defenestratus It'll be difficult for me to go back to a Google phone after the nightmare that was my 6P. Major Sceptic Availability is no problem in my neck of the woods , and I appreciate the work Google did on the camera as a point and shoot and smooth software , but after looking at the pixels they looked a bit underwhelming in the feature department , and then as mentioned the outrageous​ prices for the pixels I wouldn't go near one . I might add with the smooth software , Google no longer has the Monopoly on as most devices with 7.0 onwards are very good . Rod What feature does it miss? redsoxwin I'm not sure what this person's agenda is, but this is great phone. Strange article. Amie Perry Porter I personally love my Pixel phone. Will Dutton I never cease to be amazed that everyone always thinks that 'the next one will fix it' with android John Quincy Adams Whining about bezels is ignorance. Without bezels, how do you hold it? . ..please, bezel whiners...answer this... gar216 I'm a happy Nexus 6p user. Even prior to launch I couldn't justify upgrading my 7 month old 6p to a Pixel XL. It would have clearly been an upgrade, but I didn't think it was enough of an upgrade for the price. Also... It's kinda ugly. SiliconAddic "The Google Pixel is a notoriously hard phone to get a hold of. Persistent stock issues have plagued Google's first "in-house" handset from day one, and things really are little to no better in the six months since the launch event. " Um BS. Google has ALWAYS his issues with distribution. The Nexus 5 had this issue, the Nexus 6 had this problem, the 6p also had this problem and now the pixel. Google is incompetent when it comes to this. Meanwhile Apple can launch a new phone and you can walk into any of their stores and pick one up. I wanted a Pixel to replace my Nexus 6, could not get one. I ended up with a S7 edge. Google and Nintendo should team up with their inability to ship jack ****. Eric How does this stand to affect the resale value / trade-in value for current pixel owners under project fi? I'm asking as someone who switched to project fi from Verizon prepaid in early January, and has almost been regretting it ever since. I am a quadriplegic in a power wheelchair to whom the pixel with Google Assistant seemed a natural front runner, due to its voice capabilities, and project fi with it's much touted multi Network and Wi-Fi hopping capabilities seemed a good decision as well. Did my due dilligence and the 4G network to all appearances covered me completely, even though I live with my elderly parents in a rural area. The only option available for order at the time was a white Pixel (not XL) and 32gb. I was nervous about the 32 part at the time, but felt comfortable with the infinite backup capability of Google photos. Now, 3 1/2 months later, not only is service spotty, audio crackly despite not being a candidate for replacement under the microphone bug, and Google's customer service... Let us politely say not the most helpful on the issue. I apologize about the length of this comment, (and after reading over it I really should have made it a direct message) but the difference between a phone worth $600 and the phone worth $300 in retail/tradein is quite a big deal to someone like me, and as much as I love my pixel (and admire/fear/respect Google) getting out while the getting is good is starting to sound the smarter move. ( especially after the 180 they made on the 5x.... Grrrrr) Was curious to get an educated opinion on the subject. Thanks again for your ( and anyone else's who has read this far) time and any insight offered! dizel123 Opinion: Even if you can, you probably shouldn't read David Ruddock's articles anymore. Adam Myself having been using the Pixel since day one, I would agree to an extent... Would I go out a purchase a brand new Pixel/Pixel XL for full retail? Of course not! Only because the new iteration is just around the corner. Now, would I go buy a Galaxy S8 or an iPhone 7? No way, wouldn't even consider it! I have switched phones at least every 6 months for the past 3 to 4 years, between Android and iOS operating systems as well... Having said that, the Pixel has been the best phone and best experience that I have had to date! This is the first time that I haven't thought about what phone I want to get next, and to be honest there would have to be significant improvements for me to even get the newest iteration when it comes out this fall. This phone as just been that good. To sum things up... I would not buy the Pixel/Pixel XL right now at full retail cost, I definitely would NOT go out and buy a Galaxy S8 or an iPhone either... If you, like myself, really love the Pixel line and want to get one and don't already own one. I would suggest trying to hold out and get the newest release this fall. It's most definitely worth the wait! D13H4RD2L1V3 Google always seems to have issues with stocking ever since the Nexus days. Pretty embarrassing that it's still hard to get a hold of one after 6 months. Probably due for a small price cut soon, as newer phones roll out. me me yeah I loved Nexus back with Nexus 4, 5, 7. Now the Nexus banner is carried by the likes of Moto G, OnePlus.... H2OSKI So true. The bluetooth issues alone nearly make this phone unusable. Drops and cutout's every 20 seconds. Get this, my Pixel was fine UNTIL Google sent out "the server side" update to fix the Bluetooth issues my phone never had!!! Thanks Google. Mine is going back this week. Great camera crap bluetooth. I take pics occasionally​ but I need to use a bluetooth headset hours a day. Multiple headphones, headsets, and vehicle connections with all the same result...even in safe mode. Fail. Daishi Google shot themselves in the foot when they gussied up an HTC 10 and called it a Pixel. It is just any other Android phone and doesn't have the support behind it to justify the price. Six months along, it should be more than 50% off. William Ross Why the hell is this idiot comparing a 6 month old device to the newer releases? A year in smartphone years is a lifetime. That being said, the pixel still has the best most up to date software bar none! The camera is still among the best if not the best. And, although the 835 is a newer processor, the 821 is no slouch. GTFOH with this garbage article. And, I'll definitely be getting the next Pixel regardless of price. And, I'll sell my original on eBay for a pretty penny. And, this baby has no scratches any where. It's always been in a case and all glass has been protected by Liquid Armor. diggie Pixel is a $650+ phone built like a budget chinese phone. And sorry, Oneplus has Google beat on OS features while keeping "stock" feel. William Ross Oh here we go again with the one plus fans always hating on the pixel. If your phone is so great then why knock the pixel? I just don't get it. Just talk about how great your actual Chinese knockoff is. No need to hate in the Pixel. The one plus has little more than a cult following and mock my words, it'll never be a mainstream device. me me Android Police and a lot of its customers are hating the Pixel. The OnePlus fans just chime in. I own a OP3T. It simply works, yep even Bluetooth. When take tax into account, its about half the price. OnePlus fans biggest concern: price creep upwards. $300 becomes $350 becomes $390 becomes.... Goblin Shark Is this article from April 1st? Absolutely no one with any knowledge of phone tech recommended a Pixel, ever! Underspeced and overpriced, I doubt there's any trouble keeping them in stock they just know nobody wants them so they're not making any. Rod Under-spec'ed? Ok Underperforming? Nope Edgar Morales I honestly don't see what the problem is I purchased my pixel XL and have not to date had any issues whatsoever with it no Bluetooth issues no speaker issues nothing everyone is saying Michael Hannigan Hey, if you get a phone you love and it lasts just under a year, that's good enough. What more do you expect for a few hundred bucks. Appreciate the year you loved that thing and then replace it with a new one that you can love even more. Tom Takumi Okamoto OnePlus is a better phone maker than Google. A company not even 1% worth of Google. I really want a Pixel but it's not practical. Ionut Lala I'm sorry but that is clearly not a first generation device. Not the first from Google (made by HTC and let's not forget about the Nexus line). And not the first from HTC (for obvious reasons). Aquan Belk I wish other Android manufacturers went to stock Android. I know Samsung shines in it's own apps on top of Android but vanilla Android still is and always will be the best. Rod You heard the man, people. Don't buy a Pixel because it will have bad resale value and won't be updated for long. Instead, get a model that will have bad resale value and won't be updated for long, plus has worst performance, buggy software and worse camera performance. You're welcome. Stephonz My last Google phone was Nexus 5. As much as I like pure Android experience, Google has a bigheaded trend in phones. The price point was my biggest no no after the 5X. They don't offer as much features as the other well known Android companies.. amir80 I have a Pixel 32 gb and I really really like it. Everything works great and the camera is amazing and also the battey life. For me, the fingerprint sensor is a must. The S8 sensor is poorly located and the G6 sensor is too small. GeorgeDao123 Absolutely. The Pixel duo are 2 pieces of $#!¶. They run pure Android version and they are so slow to boot up and open apps though they are lag-free. Neru Nexus I've had a pixel since launch day. For one I don't agree with the bluetooth issues. Keep the phone up to date or use the bluetooth connect and play app to automate things. Second it is a over priced phone but so is an iPhone. The main reason real users should get a pixel is the updates. Sure you might need to learn something about that expensive piece of tech you bought and not just sit on your hands waiting for the apples or googles of the world to update your shit, but at least google gave us source code, kernel code and a unlocked bootloader. There are still updates being made for the old nexus 5, that's like 5 years old. Grab iphone 4s and tell me again about how fucking great those updates are lol. You can't even install apps like skype or whatsapp that thing is pooched. I can promise the world that even if google stops updating the pixel in 2018 there will be updated versions of the os you can manually install for years. Let's see if you can get more then one firmware update on your fancy new samsung s8. My money is on 1, then the s9 will launch a year later and samsung just won't care about the s8. rjcuk What if you want a slightly smaller phone? The S8 is 5.8" compared to the Pixel at 5". I really struggle to hold 6" phones. Even the Nexus 5X at 5.2" was too big to grip properly and comfortably. Janoo Ramachandran DON'T BUY A PIXEL. We have 2 Pixels at home. One bought early November 16 and the other end Jan 17. The one I was gifted this January, within 40 days had microphone related issues. I could not hear anyone on the phone, nor was the music being played out. They refused a replacement. My phone sat in the repair centre for 8 plus day and the mother board replaced. Have you ever heard of a new phone device of any other brand needing a mother board replacement in leads than 45 days WELL GOOGLE PHONE PIXEL NEEDED IT. The other phone bought early November 16 started having other issues last month and it wasn't recognizing the wifi. After at least 20 hours on the phone with the terrible google support, it had to be sent to the repair centre where it was kept for 2 weeks, you heard that right 16 days to be precise. Then the phone came back with a chip replaced. SHOULD YOI BUY A PIXEL EVER. :. NEVER SHOULD YOU LOOK AT GOOGLE AS A PHONE MAKER :. NEVER Nikhil I wholeheartedly concur here. I picked up a Pixel sometime around December which had to be promptly returned for a replacement as the volume rocker was rickety. The replacement didn't last long either. Within a month, the widely acknowledged microphone issues popped up and after almost 15 days of talking to the very incompetent Google support in India, their only resolution was to take the Pixel to the service center. The service center did not have the motherboard in stock (they had to bring it all the way from Taiwan) and my phone still languishes there even after 15 days of me submitting it. The phone suffers from not only just Gen-one product issues, but also terrible after sales support. Leonardo Baez Agree.... ait for the next generation THEN buy current generation cheaper. Jeremy Allan Actual customer service? You do realize that owners of a pixel get free 24/7 support any time, on a dedicated line for pixel owners? Exalm There is the same section in the settings on Nexus 5X and 6P. No idea whether it works, since there's no chat or phone support in Russia neither for Nexus nor Pixel. Cory Wilson I agree. Granted it was around a year ago I bought my 6p but the 6p didn't cost $870 either. Still don't regret that decision Impulse_Vigil Haven't really had any serious Pixel Bluetooth issues here... A handful of times (literally less than half a dozen) BT shut itself off back in Feb-March, hasn't happened again since the Play Services patch. I use Bluetooth on a daily 24/7 basis too with my ZenWatch 3, car audio, etc. I don't push it to its range limits tho. Dunno whether David's usage and issue is some sorta edge case, or range related, or whether he was speaking to the 1-2 month period when others were having more severe Bluetooth shut off issues. I do agree with the overall sentiment tho, Google hasn't made it easy to buy the Pixel and that's simply inexcusable. I haven't had to suffer thru any of the QC issues (no BT, mic, whatever issues here, knock on wood) but it seems they weren't handled super well either. To be honest I wouldn't even recommend the S8 to anyone either unless it's another geek/enthusiast, these days for most people it's simply not worth it to spend that kind dosh on a phone. I bought my mother a Moto Z Play; I'd probably point others towards that, the OP3, or an HTC One/S7 on sale. I'm super happy with my Pixel, but if there was a OnePlus 3-class device for Zoglog Having owned a pixel XL and now a s8+, I'd have to agree. Even not taking into account the questionable hardware reliability of the pixel (mine died in 5 months). Basically when I owned the pixel I loved the hell out of stock Android but I kept on wondering why I paid so much for it. Meanwhile with the S8+ the gorgeous screen makes it feel especially special and worth the price. Even though I would prefer stock Android 10000% sebastianer Pixel is just another Nexus. Like the 6P. There is no excuse, this is not their first premium phone. Still made by HTC instead of Huawei. And called Pixel instead of Nexus...and more expensive because of HTC and all the marketing costs. And..still has the shitty compass all their recent previous nexus had with a lot of topics open in Google product forums and staff giving tons of manuals about how to perfect calibrate something that doesn't retain calibration. But the main reason I wouldn't buy a Pixel...is the compass and secondly that you will get one more android update if you wait 6 months. username_not_valid How is the pixel the first 'in-house Google phone'? Its clearly and actually a slightly rehashed HTC. HTC doesn't just make it ,they designed it for all intents and purposes. Unless Googles design strategy happens to be exactly like HTCs then its not a Google phone. The Pixel is just an over priced nexus, nothing else. SOUL- Always great to see the smartphone community go from praising a phone to outright basing it just after a couple of months. Perfectly fine with my Pixel. Michael Sørensen It's just ... really boring. andy mckenzie It's a superb phone , blazing fast so processor is not an issue , amazing camera , free storage , online support has been fast and efficient in my experience, stock Android , I'd highly recommend to anyone. remister I am still using my 6P, I couldn't swallow the 1K price tag for 128GB with insurance.... Justin Field Yeah, I broke the screen on my 5x, and since I am on Fi I considered getting a pixel for about 2 seconds and ordered and new screen and fixed my phone. I will wait for the next gen or switch off of Fi.

Subscribe to Newsweek from $1 per week The report slammed companies for “outsourcing” some of the monitoring of their platforms to taxpayer-funded bodies: “In the U.K., the Metropolitan Police’s Counter Terrorism Internet Referral Unit (CTIRU) monitors social media companies for terrorist material,” the report said. “That means that multi-billion pound companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter are expecting the taxpayer to bear the costs of keeping their platforms and brand reputations clean of extremism,” it added. The report also tackles the failure by social media companies to remove t errorist and extremist material. “The weakness and delays in Google’s response to our reports of illegal neo-Nazi propaganda on YouTube were dreadful,” it said, “Despite us consistently reporting the presence of videos promoting National Action, a proscribed far-right group, examples of this material can still be found simply by searching for the name of that organisation.” “We recommend that all social media companies introduce clear and well-funded arrangements for proactively identifying and removing illegal content—particularly dangerous terrorist content or material related to online child abuse,” the report concluded. A YouTube spokesperson told Newsweek via email: “We take this issue very seriously. We’ve recently tightened our advertising policies and enforcement; made algorithmic updates; and are expanding our partnerships with specialist organisations working in this field. We’ll continue to work hard to tackle these challenging and complex problems." Nick Pickles, Twitter's U.K. Head of Public Policy, said via email: “Our Rules clearly stipulate that we do not tolerate hateful conduct and abuse on Twitter. As well as taking action on accounts when they're reported to us by users, we've significantly expanded the scale of our efforts across a number of key areas. “From introducing a range of brand new tools to combat abuse, to expanding and retraining our support teams, we're moving at pace and tracking our progress in real-time. We're also investing heavily in our technology in order to remove accounts who deliberately misuse our platform for the sole purpose of abusing or harassing others. It's important to note this is an ongoing process as we listen to the direct feedback of our users and move quickly in the pursuit of our mission to improve Twitter for everyone,” he continued. Newsweek has contacted Facebook for a comment. The inquiry into hate speech online was prompted by the murder of Jo Cox, the Labour Party MP killed by a far-right extremist called Thomas Mair during the Brexit campaign. The committee also heard evidence relating to Islamophobia, misogyny, far-right extremism, the role of social media in hate crime and the particular issues faced by members of parliament in relation to hate crime and its violent manifestations. The report did note some positive behavior by social networks: “We welcome the fact that YouTube, Facebook and Twitter all have clear community standards that go beyond the requirements of the law,” it said. “We strongly welcome the commitment that all three social media companies have to removing hate speech or graphically violent content, and their acceptance of their social responsibility towards their users and towards wider communities.” Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read Related Stories India: Kashmir Bans Social Media Sites After Protests Man Dragged Off United Plane Sparks Outrage in China ISIS Supporters Rejoice at U.K. Parliament Attack Most Read © 2017 Newsweek LLC Sign up For The Newsletter About Us Corrections Contact Us Newsweek Media Group Careers Advertise Copyright Privacy Policy Terms of Service Terms of Sale Archive Recent Issues Subscribe April 28 Issue Uncle Sam Wants You…to Be a Racist!

Opinion: Even if you can, you probably shouldn't buy a Google Pixel anymore David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/05/01 2:09pm PDTMay 1, 2017 66 Plus 1 on G+ 263 Share on Facebook 60 Share on Twitter Total Shares389 Editorials Pixel Pixel XL The Google Pixel is a notoriously hard phone to get a hold of. Persistent stock issues have plagued Google's first "in-house" handset from day one, and things really are little to no better six months after the launch event. Honestly, it's a bit embarrassing just how consistently incompetent Google seems to be at keeping a reasonable inventory of phones available for purchase. But setting that aside, as one of the Pixel's most ardent evangelists, I think there's something it's probably time for me to come clean on: Even if you could buy a Pixel today, I really think you shouldn't. The Pixel is a product with generation-one product issues. The Bluetooth performance is horrid. It's not waterproof. The bezels really are due for a shrink. I don't think the exterior coating on the black and blue variants is of a particularly high quality. The glass window gets scuffed up incredibly easily. The Snapdragon 821 is officially old news. And it doesn't support proper advanced network features across all four of the big US carriers. There are other flaws I could point to, and while none of them are too terrible, they do speak to the slightly-rushed development cycle this phone seems to have been subjected to. Sure, Google got some things astoundingly right: the performance, the camera, the larger software experience. In fact, I think the Pixel is easily the best Android smartphone ever for these strengths, at least if we're talking about me personally as a user (your mileage, obviously, may vary). But for all the great, smooth, fast, clean, pure, simple, natural, and various other adjective-members singing in the Pixel-praise cavalcade, this phone is not the one to buy right now. For starters, Google continues to ask what is an increasingly laughable amount of money for the model most of us want - the 128GB XL - at a staggering $870. Sure, Apple charges the same for an iPhone 7 Plus 128GB, but I'm under no illusion that this comparison in any way favors Google. The iPhone comes with Apple customer service (with actual stores), a longer software support period going forward, and runs no real risk of poor resale value. The Pixel? Google's online support is iffy at best, we know the phone will be unsupported by October 2018, and I have a strong feeling generation-one Pixel resale values will drop like a rock once the new phones are announced. And that really is why, if you haven't pulled the trigger on a Pixel yet, you should just wait. It's overpriced, under-supported, and competing phones like the Galaxy S8 offer a whole lot more technology for your money. The Galaxy S8+ is $20 less than a 128GB Pixel XL, and I would argue it is far and away the better smartphone value. That amazing display, brand-new Snapdragon 835 processor, jaw-dropping design and packaging, and the full support of all our American carriers' latest LTE advancements could each be a reason on its own to put the Galaxy S8 above Google's smartphone. Do I still prefer using the Pixel over the S8? Sure. But I wouldn't buy a 128GB Pixel XL over a Galaxy S8+ today. That would be, frankly, a bit silly. If Google was asking $670 and not $870, the discussion would probably change, but they aren't. You've got to pay full price, and there's no way I could recommend anyone do that. If you're still on the fence about the Pixel, let me try to push you over: wait for the next generation. I realize that this sort of thinking can devolve into a rationale that encourages you to never upgrade anything because something newer, faster, and better is constantly on the horizon. But in this case, I think it's a consideration that is worth weighing more seriously than usual. Many of the Pixel's biggest flaws relate to Google's inexperience producing a smartphone. Issues that only come up as you try to mass-produce and distribute a product with a real marketing campaign that creates real demand, and the phone gets into the hands of "real" users who aren't part of the now-derailed Nexus phone hypetrain. Inside Google, expectations were no doubt managed, realities realized, and priorities accordingly re-calibrated after this first launch. (Side note: if the Bluetooth performance on the next Pixel is as bad as the first one, I may scream, Google.) Meanwhile, the things that make the Pixel great aren't going anywhere. The next Pixel will be fast, it will take great photos, and it will offer a wonderfully unfettered Android experience. Those that make it less than great? Google is no doubt drilling down through the worst of them in order to ensure the Pixel 2 - or whatever it's called - won't make the same mistakes that the original did (waterproofing, please). And one of the primary reasons to try the Pixel in the first place - to be on the very bleeding edge - really only remains true from a software standpoint. Older phones like the Nexus 5X and 6P don't even let the Pixel have an advantage there, as they're on the same update track until around the time the next Pixel phones launch. If you absolutely need a smartphone soon and the Pixel is tempting you, ask yourself this: Can you deal with a Moto G5 Plus for six months if it means having a better Pixel down the road? While as a reviewer I have the admitted luxury of not needing to consider such things, were I in such a position, I'd have little in the way of a counterargument to offer. Sure, you'll take a resale hit on anything you buy now, but the Pixel is going to face a much, much steeper devaluation curve in that time than any budget phone. Buying a Pixel right now just doesn't make sense. I love my Pixel XL, but I'm officially done recommending the phone to friends and relatives. Instead, I'll tell them to wait, or to get the Galaxy S8 they were probably going to buy anyway. Tags editorial google pixel google pixel xl opinion pixel xl subscribe ...

Google really shot themselves in the foot with availability. My name is…. No, they shot their foot with huge bezels, with lack of waterproof, lack of dual speakers, no real camera progress compared to nexii, meh battery life, meh screen. No real selling point besides being pure android phone. This phone had iphone price but was worst on so many levels (no A10 SoC, no iphone-fast NAND, no 4yrs updates) Oneplus on the other hand........ M. Luciano Also has none of that stuff, but is cheaper? My name is…. yes, half price cheaper. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ The black screen issue kind of negates anything else ;) Michael Hannigan What's the "black screen issue"? Carson Saldanha YOU WANT THE PIXEL TO HAVE THE A10 CHIP?? BHAAAAAAAHAHAHA My name is…. No, i want it to have a cheaper price, or be better somehwere else, like the Galaxy. STOP BEING RUDE Carson Saldanha https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CYF7C6hVAAAKF-_.jpg Tr3ple Shut up troll ,nobody likes you I see lmao My name is…. You know when you see the dumb guy, he always adds 'lol' or 'lmao' at the end of his sentence. And his syntax is always wrong. STFU and GTFO Liam Bulkley "You know when you see the dumb guy... And his syntax is always wrong." "You are an [sic] ignorant" Don't cut yourself on the glass. Michael Hannigan They have that - The Nexus 5x. Тарас Мукин You keep hating Pixel in the comments, but you only look at numbers. But they doesn't matter when it comes to Google. Software experience does. My name is…. That's a stupid argument Тарас Мукин And saying that somebody's argument is stupid without any explanation is a much smarter argument. My name is…. Would you pay 900$ bucks for Nexus 5 just because "Software experience matters"?? Carson Saldanha Nobody said they were paying just for the "software experience" Matt Tapac said that specs don't matter, the software experience does. That heavily implies that people are paying for the software experience. Carson Saldanha xD here we go again drunken_bastard Pixel and Pixel XL have better cameras and screens than any iPhone. The difference in SoC and other bits of hardware, they don't translate into any real world speed differences. Pixel also has great battery life. Perhaps some hands on time may do you some good. supersanborn Given that they continually sell out of the limited stock they have, none of what you cited matters. If they had a ginormous supply of units and THEN couldn't sell, then perhaps you would be on to something. My name is…. What was the availability in the first place? You think they produced many? No way Jose, i bet Galaxies and iphones outsold pixels by multiple times supersanborn We don't exactly know what they had hoped to produce or even what they actually produced, so your point remains conjecture. And who here is suggesting that Samsung and Apple phones didn't outsell the Pixel? My name is…. * by multiple times James Betti Sadly, Google isn't keeping the Pixel in stock because they don't care about their hardware line. Google makes most of its money through ads and personal data. It's a shame, but it explains why they discontinue successful products and barely have much in stock. Excellent phone by the way. Michael Hannigan Well, that's easy to rectify. Do like Amazon and offer the same exact hardware with "special offers" for a lower price. Then you get to see ads everywhere, even your home screen and app drawer. Pretty cool. Michael Hannigan Yes, they did. It was in the millions. Max "no real camera progress compared to nexii, meh battery life, meh screen." Ok, so you don't have a Pixel, we get it. My name is…. I'm not dumb, do you get that too? Xchris I think the consensus here is that you are talking bollocks. The pixel XL has an unbelievably good screen, one of the best battery life figures, still has the best camera out of any smartphone. Nobody who bought the pixel cares that much about any of your other points. In fact, what you are really saying is that you didn't like the pixel. Big deal! My name is…. Actually, i'm fighting the pixel in a nerdy community. Its expected that the consensus is that "i am talking bollocks". People here mainly wanna root their phones and put center clocks on status bar. they did the same with Nexii devices, its all about the software, but those phones were seriosly lacking (i used to own all Nexus devices after 4) Carson Saldanha So may I ask, what phone do you use now? My name is…. 1+3 Carson Saldanha Srsly!?!? Bruh, the OnePlus 3 has a Snapdragon 820 while the Pixel has a 821, a far better camera, better performance, and software. How is the OP3 better than the Pixel? Besides the price? I could probably understand if you had the OP3T, but no way. My name is…. You are an ignorant. 1) Check the speedtests, 1+3 is faster (because better nand) 2) Software is better on 1+3 (aosp with tiny mods) 3) Pixel has underclocked 821, thus 820 with a little bit of better battery life (1+3 has 1080p screen to tie this up) 4) 1+3 has 6gb ram (will be good for 4 years) 5) 1+3 is smaller than pixels, unbelievably thin 6) 1+3 has dash charging (world leading) 7) 1+3 has half the price 8) 1+3T is another story, far better Apply cream to the burn, son PS Yes Pixel has a better camera. Carson Saldanha Ignorance at it's finest. My name is…. Those are all FACTS, son. My name is…. Where are you, son? Jack Smith Have you ever even used a Pixel? Only Android phone i have used with zero touch lag. Can we also stop the name calling? Mason Andrew Maseda Hate to break it to you man. I own The One Plus 3T the Google Pixel the Nexus 6P and the Moto X pure edition. Lol. Guess witch one is my daily driver? The Pixel. Why? Better battery . Better cam. All around the most reliable phone. Even with my Nexus 6P I've had some issues here and there tiny ones. Like some days my battery life was abnormally shit and the next day it was great. The one plus 3T has tiny issues too. The Pixel is a phone that you wouldn't understand UNLESS YOU TRY ONE FOR A DAY. come back when you do. tansuperman Not sure why people think the pixel takes good pics. I have a pixel xl, 950xl, IPhone 7plus, and now the s8. In my opinion the pixel xl takes the worst pics. The lumia 950xl is stop dog. The pixel I can tell is just too overprocessed Michael Hannigan I think it applies mostly to low light pictures - absolutely nothing touches the Pixel in that respect - trust me. More generally, it applies to the software and hardware working together to create stunning (real) HDR pictures. But in low.light, which according to a friend of mine who is a smartphone camera freak (I am not), quality of low light pictures are what users are primarily interested in because he says "...any recent smartphone can take great pictures in daylight.". For me, I liked the flexibility of the V20 camera - not just the dual lenses, but the absolutely fantastic functions in the camera app. D13H4RD2L1V3 Um, the 821 consumes less power than the 820 at the lower clocks due to a more efficient binning process. Also, both the Pixel and OP3 use UFS 2 controllers. But on Nougat, the 3 uses F2FS for its filesystem. It's not a case of better NAND. It's a case of different filesystems. Michael Hannigan I think they should use FAT16. I miss it. Chris Rey I will say the Axon 7 is just as good as the OnePlus 3 and looks better. Suicide_Note The Pixel camera is definitely superior to what was in the 6P, and i say that as someone who currently owns them both. M. Luciano I use both on a daily basis. Agree with you 100%. So do objective measurements of the cameras. Pixel is the best on the market; 6P is decent but not great. andy_o On paper both cameras should be just short of identical, but the Pixel is so much faster in processing cause of the HVX dedicated core, plus the N6P throttles like crazy (in one of my photospheres tests in a warm room the Nexus 6 beat it every time). This is crucial especially with Google who is prioritizing computational photography probably on par or more with hardware camera specs. Also, I'm not sure if this is a hardware or artificial limitation, but HDR+ auto has completely different behavior on the Pixels. I can understand how someone who has only looked at the specs and not used a Pixel and N6P (especially in the summertime), can think that there's been "no real camera progress", but this guy is balls-deep in the "arrogance of ignorance". Michael Hannigan I think the reason for the difference in HDR+ in the Pixel is that it's" real HDR - it takes several pictures and then layers them. Other phones have taken a shortcut do doing that with one picture and it really doesn't achieve the same. Except in one case - manually setting HDR in my Note 7 gave absolutely stunning night time photos. Something I can't quite achieve with the built in software on the Pixel (but can with Photoshop). andy_o I was talking the difference between HDR+ auto in the Pixel and HDR+ auto in the previous phones. The auto behavior in the Pixel is different, but the HDR+ processing is basically the same. There's more info here: http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/11/21/deep-dive-closer-look-google-pixels-camera/#What_does_HDR_do If you feel nerdy enough I can link you to a paper on HDR+ by the Google computational photography team too :) Regarding the other phone cameras, the reason they do worse isn't exactly that they they're taking shortcuts, it's actually because they're doing it the traditional way, taking different exposures. Read the AP article linked above for details on how HDR+ is fundamentally different. Michael Hannigan You have OLED burn-in? I have about 8 hours SOT/day and don't have any. That would piss me off. Jason B Inverting colors for a bit while doing some extended reading helps. Black background with white text is easier on the eyes too. But yeah, static nav bar and notification area aren't great for OLED. There should be auto pixel shift to prevent it ... or Google should make more use of Immersive Mode. whispy_snippet Ugh. Like a broken fucking record here sometimes. Shawn Spring While some of your other points may/may not be valid, to say that the Pixel had "no real camera progress compared to nexii" just makes you sound ignorant. The S821 ISP alone would make the camera in the Pixel superior, not to mention the updated HDR algorithms. Get a Pixel owner and a 6P owner in the same room (I was both) and ask them to shoot with each others phone and see who prefers which. The 6P camera lag in HDR mode was inefficient at best and unbearable at worst. And it wasn't that long ago that OnePlus was using a broken invite system, had people lick their phones, and had a horribly gender insensitive marketing campaign. I'd probably not hold them up as the standard bearer against Google. Michael Hannigan They had people lick their phones? Why did they never ask me to do that? That's discrimination. I should have been asked to lick my phone. Brett Lewis I love my pixel after coming from a HTC 8x on Windows platform. Never liked Apple and never will. And lately after all the talk of Samsung's products (blowing up, red screens, other problems) I'm quite happy with my pixel. I don't need water proofing I'm not an idiot that takes my phone near water.. the I hardly notice the bezels after coming from a 4.3 inch 720 display.. The htc8x had one of the widest angle front cameras but I dont take selfies. This pixel does what I want and is fast doing it. And for first time experiencing Android I'm quite happy with buying this with the newest and best version available. TheHater So only idiots take their phones near water? I bet if you had a water resistant phone, you'd take it near water. Michael Hannigan What about the toilet? Who doesn't read the news when sitting on the shitter? Mariano Moreira I would definitely agree in terms of the Pixel XL vs iPhone 7 plus comparisons (Non-32GB model) Comparing the base iPhone 7 vs base Pixel...the iPhone 7 base had(has) slow Nand performance from what I have witnessed. The 32GB iPhone 7 vs base 32GB Pixel (5") seems like a closer comparison where the compromise is better battery life on the Pixel, faster Nand, and better screen. Again, I concur that looking at the Pixel XL vs iPhone 7 Plus leans more heavily towards Apple especially when comparing the 128GB models. Michael Hannigan If you buy from the Google store, they are carrier agnostic - absolutely 0 carrier bloatware. Mariano Moreira No. I have a Google Play(Bootloader unlocked) purchased Pixel. Normally used on Sprint or At&t. When I activate on Verizon: to get Vo-LTE calling with Verizon SIM and certain carrier settings it does a software update switching the phone over to the Verizon specific software build. If it was truly Carrier-agnostic it wouldn't force a Carrier specific Software build onto my non-Verizon model Pixel. Michael Hannigan You must have either bought it from Verizon or screwed something up. An unlocked phone doesn't suddenly become carrier specific like you describe Mike John Quincy Adams I don't one person who owns or says ’I sure wish I had a OnePlus.' Michael Hannigan I have - when I had the OnePlus One. Many people asked me about it. You can't deny that OnePlus phones offer an unbeatable value. They don't skimp on specs and sell for half the.price they should. asrat_24 I get you're trying to make fun of that guy but don't make ignorant statements while trying to do it. Oneplus makes good phones and people are interested enough nowadays to say that. Major Sceptic Agree on all points , a mid range device with a flagship price , perhaps Google will adjust the prices on the 2 ? for a company trying to expand it's phone sales it's going a funny way about it . Artem Russakovskii Well, usually at that point you start seeing significant discounts, but the Pixel is a misnomer in that regard to due to low stock and high demand. Max Exactly, I would revise that affirmation to state: "I've always felt once we are less than 6 months from the new iteration, it's a mistake to buy the existing product *at full price*." supersanborn I'll grant there's a case to be made for some phones where waiting can result in substantial discounts (especially from HTC/LG/etc). Probably a little of my bias sneaks in here. I prefer to have the newer device, and if I waited 6 months post-launch, it probably means I myself need to wait until the next launch. Max I'm with you there, I usually buy a phone at launch or a couple of months later at most but remember that we aren't regular customers, that's why we read and comment on this site ;). For many people out there it makes more sense to buy a phone six months after release if it comes with a nice worthy discount. M. Luciano This ^^ supersanborn Agreed, for some, shaving $100-200 off the price is all that matters. I usually caution folk pretty hard in the last 3 months before the new iteration drops if they have any form of new feature/size/color envy. supersanborn And yeah, I'm nowhere near the "normal" consumer :-) needa Supposed to be picking up a 32gb XL (Google) for $450 near mint in a couple hours. I might not get it, but a killer deal nonetheless. M. Luciano Smash that deal :) Very nice. needa A few little scratches on the back glass. Profit.

The lowest I've seen on Swappa was $695 for a black XL. supersanborn True. I usually find that the discounts are kind of on the "meh" side though until we hit release of new product. I always basically tell folks that you either buy it at launch until about 6ish months post-launch, and if you've held off that long, you should just wait until next launch and either buy the old product at a big discount or buy the new one. Matt I believe your use of misnomer was a bit of a misnomer. Artem Russakovskii I did use the wrong word, you're right. el_smurfo That's why I just picked up a 6p last year for $400. Most expensive smartphone I've ever bought, but the full release price was just not in my budget. Karly Johnston Battery issues? MisterAlex Maybe an anomaly... but not a misnomer. paxmos Where is this high demand you guys talk about?, I have yet to see a pixel in anyone's hand M. Luciano Really? I know over a dozen people who have or had them. paxmos Yep...I see lots of iPhones and Sammy's, even one Blackberry Z30, have only seen a pixel in the Verizon store. M. Luciano I feel like a nerd owning 4 Major Sceptic It does seem to have more of an enthusiast following , no shortage of pixels in my region , the usual brands , apple, Samsung, still seem to have the sales , I know not one person that has a pixel or wants one , and I think Google only has itself to blame on that front, Re : the cost of a pixels . Goblin Shark Finally, someone who knows what they're taking about - my head is just shaking in disbelief reading what these marshmallow brains that think they know about phones are saying on this comment thread lol Daishi Exactly. I have yet to see a Pixel in the wild. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ To be fair, HTC isn't used to such a high demand for their phones. Google unfortunately paid the price Daishi This made me LOL! A post full of WIN for sure!! Zoglog Actually it's probably because of all the RMA's they've gotten JD Thought that was obvious. syxbit I wonder whether we shouldn't wait for Pixel + 2. The next Pixel may technically be the first Google made product (current Pixel is made by HTC), so it's possible the Pixel 2 will have first gen problems. Still, I still have the N6P (after I scoffed at the Pixel price and refused to buy it), so I going to be looking for a phone soon. Good_Ole_Pinocchio HTC is also manufacturing the Pixel 2. Word on the street. Daishi That's too bad. I'll avoid this this phone as well... Captain On! Well, technically the iPhone is made by Foxconn, so... Don't expect Google to actually build their own facilities to produce hardware. Carson Saldanha Pretty sure they'll still be using HTC. Might have more control over the design this time around though. 4Ui812 The availability issue is a play out Nintendo's handbook. Good_Ole_Pinocchio 100% agree with the entire article... Do I want the Pixel Software Experience and Camera? Yes... But not when the new version is a few months away thag would probably fix all the issues I see posted on this site ever so often...starting with the Bluetooth issues. I got an S8... Because it's the only phone thay makes sense to me right now..... I'll see what Google is doing in the fall Max Johnson If the Moto G5 Plus had NFC I would have no problem making it my Android daily driver for the next 6 months. wade_county Moto Z Play and OP3/OP3T are other options with NFC. shadowx360 I used to buy 1 generation old Nexus devices to get around the cost issue, but it seems the 5X and 6P both are plagued by serious phone-killing issues. Now that warranty is up on nearly every used 5X/6P, buying used is like trying to navigate a minefield. I don't really trust 1st generation Pixel to not have serious issues either. I'd never use a non-Pixel/Nexus device but I can't buy a Pixel XL knowing Samsung offers so much better hardware at a similar price. wade_county My advice is getting the next OnePlus phone or picking up a used OP3/OP3T. AndrewGM I bought a used Pixel in good shape on eBay, as I couldn't get one from Google Store (already had a wireless provider). Switched from an iPhone 6s, after using almost every iPhone model since and including the original. Much better camera on the Pixel, especially closeups and in low light, and much easier to use overall (especially Contacts vs. iOS), as I've used mostly Google apps for a long time. I like the Google keyboard much better and the Android interface. I'm definitely satisfied with the Pixel and have no real iPhone regrets. It's true there are more apps for the iPhone, but that doesn't matter because the core apps are available on Android too. The only app I miss is Enlight, for photo editing. The one Pixel issue I agree with is the relatively poor resale value vs. iPhones (I assume). Carson Saldanha May I suggest Snapseed for photo editing? (It's developed by Google) Also, do you miss iMessage/FaceTime or is that really a con? AndrewGM Will check out Snapseed, thanks. I've been using Google Photos to lightly edit pics. The Pixel camera is so good that I often don't edit (for Instagram/FB uploads), especially if the light and composition are already good. I don't miss iMessage at all. I had to turn it off and all that stuff for my phone number when I switched, but I'm texting away every day. Emoticons seem to work fine. I don't even think about iMessage. FaceTime has been replaced with Duo for my family members, including those on iPhone. Seems to work fine. And I can share location with family members via Google Maps. I guess that brings up privacy issues vs. using Apple products, but not sure it makes a real-world difference. Battery life, btw, seems pretty good (I charge the phone overnight only). The call quality is a little less than iPhone, maybe, but overall acceptable. AndrewGM Will add that I have had the Pixel for 2 months and use it daily. I like the screen on the Pixel (or at least it never bothers me), and the issue about the "chin" at the bottom being big is a non-issue to me. I don't notice it and in fact hold the phone sometimes there, which is arguably convenient. If the phone continues to hold up, I'll be a customer for Pixel 2 eventually. Eric I was ready to jump to the Pixel XL after returning my second Note 7, but Google never gave me the opportunity to give them my money. Carson Saldanha xD My name is…. It was never a good device. thank you for finally admitting that. Andrew I don't think that's what the author is saying... My name is…. Someone had to be crazy to buy a pixel in the first place. I was bashing on that device from day one. Author, months later, says that the phone is no good. It was never good. Carson Saldanha Lord, would you just chill? Tr3ple I think he's retarded, gotta be it, lol. Must be it actually. Carson Saldanha troll by far Suicide_Note Except that's not at all what the author said, so you're either: A) trolling, B) incredibly dumb, or C) both of the above. Тарас Мукин Of course there's no point in buying Pixel for full price now. And there's more: there's no point in buying any device for it's starting price when it's 3 months old — tech gets old really fast today. And that's the whole point of not buying something at day one — everything gets much cheaper very fast. Samsungs do, LGs too. But Pixel for some reason didn't. And Nexuses were like this too. So — only buying Google devices right after release makes sense. Or buying them unofficially and cheaper. Sad, but true. sraj49 I always like and respect your articles. You put your views straight forward. But I tend not to agree with the tone and content of this article completely. I am living in Home of full Apple products and I own a Pixel XL. I love the Pixel in all aspects. Yes there are room to improvements which is true for everyone. Apple products are well designed, well built. As regards sorry gone are those days when Apple sorry was at is best which was until iPhone 4s/ iPhone 5. Now after the warmth period it is the same as Pixel. I going Pixel after sales support very good. I definitely agree with you on the most inefficient handling of supplies and also this is not the time to buy since meet models are coming. Just to add, I get sick when people say that the Pixel phones are not made by Google but by HTC. Everyone outsources manufacturing. Most of the phone are made by Foxcon staying from Apple. All phone manufacturers only design the hardware, software and the manufacturing is outsourced. Good_Ole_Pinocchio The HTC point that keeps coming up comes from the fact that Google didn't really dsign much hardware hete. They just used HTC parts. It's not the same as hardware being designed by apple then manufactureres elsewhere. andy_o I think he's right on that point. Google support may or may not be good, but it's online only. Apple support is famously good. For instance, the recent fixes for iPhone 6s battery problems. I booked an appointment, went into the store, they told me it would be a bit, went to a coffee shop, they emailed me, picked it up. Another time my iPad mini 2 mute switch broke. Again, appointment, go in the store, got it actually just exchanged on the spot. Google simply cannot do that. JohnyNoLegs What android phones have you owned prior to the pixel? And yes it's a HTC phone through and through. Scofabear Shots fired! I even dumped my 6P for a Moto z play. No regrets Futbolrunner Same here! That 808 was a lag fest. I even got the S8+ but returning it because it can't touch the Play's battery life. Dominic D I just bought a Pixel a month ago. I still would recommend it if you get one for fairly cheaply on swappa. It's awesome. Brian Demodulated My last 3 phones have been Nexus. Each has been less reliable than the last. I love how hackable they are but I think my next phone will be a Samsung Galaxy. Carson Saldanha Elaborate? Wdym by "less reliable" What issues? Brian Demodulated My Samsung Galaxy Nexus was incredible and still works today. My Nexus 5 was garbage - two broke within 1.5 years. My 6P is quirky - it doesn't charge on my home PC and although my wife's updated to 7.1.2 mine says it's up to date at 7.1.1. Tr3ple Get a pixel then, Samsung lol. Brian Demodulated I have my 6P another year. I'll see what's available next year when my contract is up. JohnyNoLegs Bootloops, dodgy updates, requires factory resets, breaks features, slow bug fixes. M. Luciano No offense, but you are not going to increase stability by going to Samsung. Brian Demodulated My old Samsung Galaxy Nexus was the best, highest quality, most reliable phone I ever owned. LG and Huawei's Nexus phones were less stable for me. M. Luciano I had a few of those.. they weren't as reliable. But probably because I did bad things to them. Brian Demodulated I rooted mine, loaded hacky ROMs, and carried it with me everywhere I went for 3 years. The USB and audio cables are a little loose now but otherwise it's saved me when my later Nexus phones crapped out on me. Vitali Galaxy nexus had clean stock rom, it is just Google's clean soft in a Samsung physical device and not with samsung's os Brian Demodulated Every Nexus has the clean stock ROM. It's one of the top reasons why I get them. JohnyNoLegs Going Pixel sure doesn't increase stability. It's less stable than my Note 4/Note 7. Vitali Agree with M. Luciano, but people try should move to Sony. Lookup at speed test videos of their Xperia XZs, it has beaten all smartphones by now, including the Pixel. All the biased big reviewers out there will never tell you the truth, stop thinking the S8 is the best phone in the world.. I recommend you to wait for their Xperia XZ Premium it will have sd835! After you see the XZs speed, I promise you it may be the fastest phone even in 2018. Suicide_Note No. Just...no. Vitali *A wild 8 year old fanboy comment appears* Brian Demodulated Speed isn't that important to me. I've heard bad things about Sony's flavour of Android and that it's bloaty. Vitali So you heard wrong, their software is one of the bests out there, and im talking from experience.. And Samsung have so clean and fast Android that it is just unbelievable.. Where do you get all that info from?? Vitali So you heard wrong, their software is one of the bests out there, and im talking from experience.. And Samsung have so clean and fast Android that it is just unbelievable.. "I've heard.." Where do you get all that info from?? Suicide_Note TW is much better than it used to be, but it's hardly clean and fast. Brian Demodulated I work in a large IT department. One of my buddies told me about it. He said Sony's Android UI was all over the place and annoying to use, and that his handset was 2 major versions behind the latest version of Android OS. dtox Lol don't listen to him, xperia phones are absolute trash. dtox LOL xperia = garbage D13H4RD2L1V3 Um, I'm not entirely sure. Not that I'm ragging Sony, but they haven't exactly been selling for a reason. Even Sony themselves know. I don't hate Sony phones. I personally think they're understated, solid offerings. Problem was that they were really overpriced. After seeing the XZs and XA1, seems like their pricing may have become more logical. We'll see how it goes. I'm personally hoping the XZP may even be a solid device. Not that I'll buy one but if the price is right, it'll be significantly easier to recommend. JSo Experiences differ from person to person. But It's odd the luck you have had with the Nexus devices. I've had the Galaxy Nexus, Nexus 5 and now the Nexus 5X and I have never had an issue with any of them. JohnyNoLegs No battery issues with 5X? My wifes upgraded to 7.1.1 and has never been the same, bluetooth is slow and laggy, and the battery barely gets 1.5-2 hours SOT after it used to get close to 3. Michael Hannigan Dude, you're talking about a crusty old obsolete phone. And unless you are happy getting 2 hours of battery time, you should pry the wallet open and buy something current. Complaining about your old phone won't make you feel better. Replacing it with a working, current phone that's not past it's expected useful life will. JohnyNoLegs Dude, wth are you talking about. It's a 1.5 years old. From new it was getting 4-5, right up until 7.1.1 update. Roy My 6P is the most reliable phone ever. And I had Samsung and HTC. Duder12 The last Nexus phones had bum processors from qc. royrov My Nexus 6P kissed the asphalt a couple of weeks ago, so I bought a perfect Pixel XL second hand (used 3-4 months). Its better, no regrets here. Faster and better battery, hell even snapchat is snappy on it! Tr3ple Exaclty lol, people saying the pixel isn't an upgrade to the 6p are delusional lol. They all like to hate on it u til they get one and realize how good of a phone it is. And all the bugs I've been seeing on the net are nowhere to be found and I had mine for 5-6 months now bekifft I know it's an upgrade. It's just not much of an upgrade for an enormous amount of money. Tr3ple My 6p had serious issues, I went and got a s7 egde(big mistake), the price I paid was well worth it. I'm still financing my s7 egde while I'm using a pixel, this is how much I love this phone. destinyhud I will still buy one Michael Tran If I could give you a phone for free but you had to keep it and use it and couldn't sell it. Which phone would it be? M. Luciano 128 GB Pixel XL, black supersanborn My 128GB Pixel XL in black. At least until the 2 comes and **hopefully** adds waterproofing, 600Mhz support, 4x4MIMO for T-Mobile. If you're reading, Pixel team, let's talk! Orlando aka Pixel XL Samsung Galaxy S8+ blue Tr3ple Gimme a 128 gb pixel XL black any day keithzg The bezels really are due for a shrink. Boy are you gonna rue this when the second-gen comes out and the bezels are the exact same ;) M. Luciano I sorta hope they are :) keithzg You animal! (But honestly, this is why choice is good. I find the desire for those top and bottom bezels incomprehensible, but I can entirely understand that not everyone would feel the way I do, particularly if routinely holding phones very differently.) M. Luciano I just want SOME bezels. They don't need to be huge. Just want a place to put my thumbs when holding it sideways. It's a good place for speakers IMO. Carson Saldanha Nah, to be fair, I think Google's definitely not planning on keeping them the same size if they've listened to the reviews. keithzg I mean, if they'd listened to reviews of many other phones before they put out the Pixels they would have known that too---including, for instance, the previous two generations of Nexus phones . . . So it seems likely that either (a) they know of the opinions of the commentariat and disagree, or (b) they felt technically they couldn't do it. I'm personally hoping it was somehow just (b) but they used (a) to convince themselves that it was an okay sacrifice, but that they won't have to make the same sacrifice again this year and they'll allow themselves to change up the design. But I'm not gonna bet too much money on that. Carson Saldanha Whoa, you lost be there with all those "a's" and "b's" xD Shawn Spring I think its pretty well known at this point that the time frame between when Google's negotiations w/Huawei fell through and when they picked the deal up with HTC was the cause of the "let's use the leftover A9 shells" bezel issue. So more (b) than (a) assuredly. ikeofkc If they do. Peoples' thumb muscles are going to be screwed if they use the pixel 1 handed, constantly trying to reach the back button. The chin makes one handed use possible keithzg See, that's what I mean about different folks and different strokes. I've never noticed it being of any help with my Nexus 6P, for me the top and bottom bezels are completely useless. bekifft If they actually put something useful there, like a front facing stereo speaker, I would be totally fine with that. keithzg Dammit, don't you go making me miss the Nexus 6 again! Michael Hannigan I want them to be bigger. I want to be able to lean on mine when I am standing in line at a movie. MadMartigan I am constantly amazed by the short memories. The author thinks it likely they are likely to have a better launch of P2? They do give the obvious impression that they believe the Pixel to be their first swing and a miss... Funny how quickly we forget, well, nearly every other device Google has ever tried to sell. I personally loved my 4, 10, 5, 6, and 6. But I cannot, while keeping a straight face, argue that one should expect anything better from them regarding inventory management this time around. How many times does Google have to fail on inventory management before we start pointing and laughing at the people who constantly say, "They'll get it right this time, for sure." Don't get me wrong - I would absolutely love it if Google proved me wrong on the P2. I just won't believe it until I see it. //dons flameproof suit// A'ight, I'm ready. Fire away... M. Luciano This is their first swing and a miss, but only because the shortages are for very different reasons than prior devices they sold on behalf of other OEM's. MadMartigan Who...who do you think made the Pixels? M. Luciano Google is the OEM for the Pixel phones (and tablets, and laptops, etc). HTC is the factory putting the phones together. It's a totally different legal and business agreement, and essentially means that Google has to supply most of the components, contracts, contacts, etc. and HTC is essentially an assembly line. On Nexus phones, the OEM was Samsung, or LG or Huawei, etc. and they actually designed and produced the phones, in partnership with and input from Google. Completely different. For those, the partner was able to do all the contracting and sourcing; HTC isn't doing all the work for Google this time. MadMartigan So you don't believe HTC designed the Pixel. Got it. That's all I needed to see. M. Luciano Not sure what that means, but ok. Google is now the OEM, that's what I am saying. Another Scott Nice post. I hemmed and hawed about a Pixel XL 128 for 6 weeks last fall and finally decided I just couldn't do it. Besides the fact that it was impossible to get from Google, I just couldn't justify the price. I decided to finally replace my LG Nexus 4 (roughly $350 new) with a new T-Mobile LG V10 from B&H in November for $330 and am quite pleased. (It would have been $300 a week or so later.) I added a Samsung EVO 128 GB SDHC card for it for $40 or so. I miss the Nexus timely updates a great deal, but I can't see spending a kilobuck on a phone to get it - especially for only a 2 year OS upgrade availability. I hope Google gets the Pixel 2 right, but maybe they figure having a "premium" phone for evangelists is good enough so they won't feel any pressure to make it available (or cut the price). Cheers, Scott. fijisiv The Galaxy S8+ is $20 less than a 128GB Pixel XL Just wow. M. Luciano Right? The Pixel is by far a better value at those prices. 128 GB storage over 16, metal over glass body, better software, better security, better camera, guaranteed to be up to date for 3 years... Samsung has some great components, but as a package, Pixel seems to keep ahead at this point. Matt I believe the S8+ is 64G and has a microSD slot. M. Luciano I think you're right. IMO that makes the Pixel better. Do you prefer less with expandable option? 03grunt I live in the mountains of NC and went back to Verizon once they brought back unlimited data and luckily the local Verizon store had a Pixel XL. I think it's pretty sad that in ~ 18 months the Pixel will be EOL. M. Luciano Luckily, it won't be. Nexus and Pixel devices are guaranteed to be fully up to date for 3 years; not 2. 2 years of major updates and 3 years of security updates = 3 years of being fully up to date. Sir_Brizz That's not entirely true. They are only guaranteed to be on the latest version for 2 years. It's unlikely it will be any different than the Nexus 6 in this regard (which didn't get 7.1 but is still getting monthly security updates). M. Luciano The Pixel and Pixel XL released October 4, 2016. They're guaranteed to be fully up to date until 10/31/2019. That's 1121 days, or 3.07 years. Sir_Brizz No. You are wrong. They are only guaranteed version updates until October 2018. The Nexus 6 was guaranteed the same thing until October 2016. It did not get Android 7.1 even though it continues to get monthly security updates. What this means is that the Pixel will get at least Android 9.0 but that doesn't guarantee it will get 9.1 or 9.2 or anything else past that. It just means it will get 9.0 and monthly security updates to 9.0 for an additional year. M. Luciano I get what you're saying, but it also launches on the latest update. So using the Pixel, it launches with N, will get O after a year, will get P after a year and then is not guaranteed to get Q. Are we really going to get a Q? So during each of those three updates, N, O and P, it on the latest OS and getting monthly security updates. 2 years of updates, so long as it includes the 2nd major OS update, translates to three full years. Ever since they started the annual number and letter update, we're essentially talking about a single API version update per year (2016 had 2, including the one you're referencing which impacted Shamu). Sir_Brizz I've already pointed this out twice: look at the Nexus 6 for a first hand example of how this is going to work. The Nexus 6 will not be on the latest version of Android for three years because it is already not on the latest version of Android despite getting monthly security updates. 03grunt Thanks for clarifying! Chris Kiederer As a Nexus 5X/project Fi user, right now the Pixel is my only choice if my Nexus decides to blow up like many before it. I really hope this Android one rumor heading to the US is true, as it would give project Fi subscribers more than just a really expensive option to stay on the plan Andye82 But exactly one year from today it will be still extremely difficult if not impossible to get your hands on pixel 2 Mix "Persistent stock issues have plagued Google's first "in-house" handset from day one..." I am on my 3rd phone and I still wonder, every time I use it, if it will be like my last two phones. I have phone PTSD! Google should just pull a Nintendo and just stop producing and move on to the 2 but not fuck it up. John Doe Great job on the article, now I will be waiting for the editorial on Google's software update policy LoL PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Google's inexperience producing a smartphone They had great experience running Motorola. Ammar "Sure, Google got some things astoundingly right: the performance, the camera, the larger software experience" To be honest, these are the only reasons why I'd ever get a Pixel over any other Android phone. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ I agree with some of Radar's points as well as teh main one as I've *never* recommended the XL because I know that the vast majority of people are sheep-like followers and/or technophobes, and I defifnitely don't want part of the onus for a technophobe's major purchase that they're going to rue the second that an iPhoner mocks them. The Pixel sells itself to PowerUsers on its own merit, which, AEB the popularity of inferior and/or questionable top-sellers, clearly supports my previous assertions. JPLoureiro Deciphering of your sentences will commence............. now. Futbolrunner What? Marty I never was going to buy an HTC Pixel. Don't like HTC and the build quality doesn't deserve such a high price. jawsnnn My SOs Pixel is probably the buggiest Google phone I have used till date. The Google Assistant, voice search are consistently broken and the phone doesn't offer much else in way of justifying it's price. Will definitely buy an OEM phone next. Google's hardware experiment is dead for me. Tim Harman I wish I'd read this 2 weeks ago! Oh well. I've got a Pixel now and I do love it. I live in NZ and the version I ended up with is the American one, which means that while it supports all my LTE bands, it doesn't support Carrier Aggregation on the bands used here. So that's my excuse for why I simply MUST HAVE the P2 when it's released. Damian Stuart Wow, what a load of crap! The Pixel is a superb phone with issues affecting small numbers of devices. I have one, after moving away from the Samsung range. I have had no issues and as I don't ever intend to take a phone swimming haven't got a single complaint about it. But haters gonna hate. sebastianer @David Ruddock Don't forget the terrible compass. If you grab an iPhone 5S and a Pixel. Open Google Maps in both of them. An you start walking trough dense downtowns the whole day (closing / opening maps at different places). You will see that the Pixel compass accuracy is constantly changing every time you open maps and is a total mess while the 5S is perfectly accurate after 1-2 seconds and less than one step. I hope the next Pixel has a completely new sensor...or compass or whatever. Last 3-4 Google Phones were a mess. I think the last Google phone with more or less good compass was the galaxy nexus but I can't even remember now TechGuy22 i'm selling mine soon since i know i can sell it around 600 dollars and it's the 128GB wjrandon So glad I kept my Nexus 6P for a second year... and look at those rock solid resale values. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9d5926ba5094521287d1d54e2476d3852462178bdf74a16166f94742b435213c.jpg TechGuy22 i sold mine for 500 dollars and i bought it used too lol that's how i managed to get the XL 128GB eric messenger It depends on what phone your coming from. For most android users it is a great phone with a great camera. If your coming from an iPhone the pixel is the first great alternative to an iphone. The on device support is actually awesome and they are very quick with support issues. I am used to Nexus devices plagued with serious issues that you had to work around and while they were great phones for the price I felt they all suffered (maybe not the 6P). Anyway the point is pixel raised the bar for Android and brought it up to par with Apple. It's probably still worth buying if you have to upgrade, and you can just get the pixel 3 in 2019 or 2020. Sean You can say this about any phone at the moment....wait for next gen. As a Project Fi user I am waiting on a phone that has the cell radio to take advantage of T-mobile's new 600mhz band they are quickly rolling out...and NO, it cant be done with a software update on any phone. me me "quickly rolling out"? The spectrum is sold but not available yet as the current user vacates.... Sean NOT TRUE....they are rolling it out in areas NOW where the old TV stations have already vacated the band. Google is your friend. me me finally, you realize it was crap, was always, still now, only thing now is you changed. Never worth the money, specs so-so for the price. Islam Google Pixel poor use of space. over-priced. BS Sean People that actually OWN one dont agree........ TechGuy22 i agree and i have one. sadly, it just stopped caring about the bezel since there's nothing i can do to make it look better VAVAMk_2 6P user here with a new battery happily waiting it out for Pixel 2. Sean Boot loop much? Ernie I have had my Nexus 6p since day one of the release. I have been lucky not to have encountered the boot loop or battery problems others have reported. I love my Nexus 6p. Hope it will get Android O. Phone_Addiction Pixel 2 probably going be the same story. Google will never learn. Dean F Marsh I love my Pixel XL! Invest in a good quality case and enjoy the phone. It's really pretty decent and for a few minor quirks mentioned, and none that I have experience yet, I can't be happier. From Nexus, HTC, Samsung, to Pixel XL, this has been the best so far. Ailín Ó’S I live in Ireland and Pixel isn't even available here yet which is odd given we were a launch country for Nexus 5x/6p but hey ho. Rick Schoonmaker This is just what I like to read after getting banged by Google and Huawei with the 6P bootloop issue 1 year and 2 days (read 2 days out of warranty) after buying and being told that my only option is to buy a new phone. So after being without a phone for a week, I had to buy a Pixel XL even though I really didn't want it and especially at the ridiculous price ($860 for 32Gb.. are you effing kidding?). Matt Definitely. I got a pixel XL the very first morning when it was available in local store. Great phone, camera, software. 2 months later, the phone began to behave crazily--extra hot, microphone malfunction. Called Google support for like 10 times and had it replaced, then I put the brand new replacement on local trade platform without hesitation. Google-brand is attatractive, but does not worth that rediculous amount of money. I can get a even better performed oneplus counterpart for almost half price. Anyway, I am on my moto x 2014 with lineage os 14 and i am pretty happy. It is sufficient for me to deal with my daily work. And I also suggest to wait for the release of more flagships from variant companies to have more flexible and reasonable options. Spinkick Google seems to not be able to follow through on anything these days. It just seems like if its not sexy or cool and needs actual work, they cant be bothered. Maybe they will release another chat app in the meantime.. 2 Men-E I want the Pixel 2 XXL (Taimen). It better exist as a 5.6"+ screened device. Philip Although if you're with TMobile. It's significantly cheaper to buy the Pixel, and get your money's worth. Granted the Pixel is guaranteed two years of support, it matches with TMobile promotion pay credit time. h4rr4r They offer a discount? I thought it was just financing. Philip Yep. $325 in TMobile bill credits over two years. Which is when the Pixel 3 will be out. So you buy a Pixel, get refunded about half of the cost. And then you're ready to upgrade to the third generation. belac77 shhh, David, I just listed my Pixel for sale on Swappa! ;) Mason Andrew Maseda This entire article is just terrible and written by someone just mad they don't have one. M. Luciano lol he got one the week after I did. He's had one. Adrianus Bratanata Supply and demand. As long as there is bigger demand than supply they don't need to reduce the price drunken_bastard I disagree. All the pros you mentioned for the Pixel -- pure Android experience, performence, camera, etc -- those are all the reasons why the Pixel and Pixel XL is still the best smartphone on the market. Worried a new one is going to come out? Happens with every flagship, every year. This one doesn't have the lastest SoC? I challenge you to demonstrate real world differences in actual speed versus the Galaxy S8, which is a gorgeous handset that yet again is crippled by bloated software and long standing issues that never seem to get addressed. You cite support potentially ending in October 2018 for software updates, but that's still a longer window than any other Android flagship, and you get them day one, which Samsung and LG don't. A smartphone is more than the sum of it's parts. It's an experience. I feel on that quality alone, the Pixel and Pixel XL are the best representations to date. NeMoDoSeZ I was going to buy a 128gb Pixel XL but due to not being available I ended up waiting and purchasing a Galaxy S8+. I'm now glad things ended up the way they did because I'm loving my S8+. Rod Until Android 8 is released. Then you'll like: fuck Samsung man! My U$xxx phone is outdated, goddamnit! Owen Iverson I hate the world of tech. We've now gotten used to NEEDING the latest thing IMMEDIATELY. Its why companies like Microsoft, Adobe, and Autodesk have switched to monthly/yearly subscriptions so you have to pay for the rest of your life. "The Bluetooth performance is horrid." What metric, speed? Connectivity? "It's not waterproof." Not sure that waterproof is a common trait among all high-end phones just yet. "The bezels really are due for a shrink." I've never used a bezel-less phone, where do you pick it up or hold it? Does your finger trigger anything on the edges? "The Snapdragon 821 is officially old news." What are you running where 1) you see lag and 2) that it's an actual problem. Maybe people are replacing consoles with their phones just like they're replacing their DSLRs with their phones? "it doesn't support proper advanced network features across all four of the big US carriers." What are these advanced network features? Anyway, I know it's a phone blog, so ... D13H4RD2L1V3 Well, he means that since its successor isn't far off, and that the Pixel is still not easy to get hold of, you might be better off waiting, since the Pixel is also selling at full price still. Edward jh How can the camera be great I mean what about the pixel camera lens flare issue plaguing 1000's of users. Margaritas Ante Porcos Pixel was a disaster. The worst phone for that price. I understand some of you got the Stockholm syndrome. But some of us see the clear picture. Google simply lost this round with both hands down. Dan Yurman My Google Pixel seems to have a mind of its owns. Here's what it does without my asking it - 1. shuts down randomly and has to be restarted by holding the power button and lower end of the volume rocker for about 15 seconds; 2. randomly starts different pieces of software including a suspiciously high frequency of instances of Google Play Music, which I have since disable, 3. Starts the flashlight from the pull down menu if the phone is placed face down on a shiny flat surface, 4 And randomly starts other programs after unlocking the phone with a pin. On the plus side the camera does good work and the phone is easily held in one hand and scrolled with fingers from the same hand while eating hit wings with the other. :-) Ray I'm very glad I read this article. I was on the fence - and almost pulled the trigger the other day but very glad I didn't now. I'll wait for the next gen and hopefully it's a much better piece of kit - and possibly cheaper. lomsha Whaaaat, you don't say. rockon999 My 2015 Moto X PE's display stopped functioning properly and I needed a new device to *function* in my daily life. So I bought a pixel, yesterday. To address your complaints... I never use Bluetooth on a phone, I'm getting a case, I'll hate the speakers (but I really only use headphones), I'm no bezel snob, and finally... waterproofing? My Moto X PE was waterproofed and I can honestly say it never aided me in one single way. Sure, it felt great using the phone in the rain that one time. But I'm fairly certain an encased pixel can survive that. I know it is probably a horrible value, but I really don't want to deal with buying a $200 phone now, selling it later for $100, and then buying a new $900 phone in a few months. I don't have time to constantly be reselling and selling my devices and I don't have a spare $100 to just throw around on a device. Slurms Mckenzie Seriously have been saying most of what this article is about since day one. I have a pixel XL and I've hated it since receiving it. It's not worth what Google asks when everything that is offered can be had for half the money (quick updates not included) for that asking price it should at least offer sd card support which is something even the most basic phones have. I've been using Nexus phones since the beginning (skipped the 6) and the problems with them were expected as it was a budget friendly phone but if you want to charge premium pricing don't use cloth for your ear piece cover, have dual speakers, and for God's sake don't make deals with the devil (Verizon) to lock down MIMO as a carrier specific feature when every damn phone is capable of and and most carriers are as well F*** you Pixel XL you sack of shit what a waste of 800 bucks Rod Best camera Google photos unlimited backup at original resolution Best performance Lowest touch latency of all Android phones "Just" that. micahthomas Basically all you're saying is wait if a new version is going to be released in 6 months. Might as well just say that, doesn't really have anything to do with if it's iPhone or Android. JG I was about to order my mother a 32GB Pixel a week or so ago to replace her Nexus 5X. I recently discovered the glass of its camera lens has a pretty decent crack in it. It doesn't seem to affect pictures - yet... But we're planning a fairly photogenic trip this summer and I figured the Pixel has a better camera and has unlimited free full resolution Google Photos uploads so... But as I was about to click the "Add to Cart" button, I thought we're not all that far from the expected October release of the Pixel 2. I'm sure mom wouldn't mind being a generation behind, but... derk p just replace the housing on hers. i bought a white one but then wanted a blue back... was cheap on ebay and is very easy to snap on and snap off dizel123 Relatively speaking we're not too far from October of next year for the Pixel 3. Or October 2019 for the Pixel 4... toast I never buy Apple, and I never buy Samsung. But both of their hardware just feel slicker than the Pixel. As the article says, knock a few hundred off the price, and I'd be a keen buyer, mainly for the camera and fast OS updates, and Google "Purity". I'll wait and see how the upcoming Moto Z and X phones turn out. Defenestratus It'll be difficult for me to go back to a Google phone after the nightmare that was my 6P. Major Sceptic Availability is no problem in my neck of the woods , and I appreciate the work Google did on the camera as a point and shoot and smooth software , but after looking at the pixels they looked a bit underwhelming in the feature department , and then as mentioned the outrageous​ prices for the pixels I wouldn't go near one . I might add with the smooth software , Google no longer has the Monopoly on as most devices with 7.0 onwards are very good . Rod What feature does it miss? redsoxwin I'm not sure what this person's agenda is, but this is great phone. Strange article. Amie Perry Porter I personally love my Pixel phone. Will Dutton I never cease to be amazed that everyone always thinks that 'the next one will fix it' with android John Quincy Adams Whining about bezels is ignorance. Without bezels, how do you hold it? . ..please, bezel whiners...answer this... gar216 I'm a happy Nexus 6p user. Even prior to launch I couldn't justify upgrading my 7 month old 6p to a Pixel XL. It would have clearly been an upgrade, but I didn't think it was enough of an upgrade for the price. Also... It's kinda ugly. SiliconAddic "The Google Pixel is a notoriously hard phone to get a hold of. Persistent stock issues have plagued Google's first "in-house" handset from day one, and things really are little to no better in the six months since the launch event. " Um BS. Google has ALWAYS his issues with distribution. The Nexus 5 had this issue, the Nexus 6 had this problem, the 6p also had this problem and now the pixel. Google is incompetent when it comes to this. Meanwhile Apple can launch a new phone and you can walk into any of their stores and pick one up. I wanted a Pixel to replace my Nexus 6, could not get one. I ended up with a S7 edge. Google and Nintendo should team up with their inability to ship jack ****. Eric How does this stand to affect the resale value / trade-in value for current pixel owners under project fi? I'm asking as someone who switched to project fi from Verizon prepaid in early January, and has almost been regretting it ever since. I am a quadriplegic in a power wheelchair to whom the pixel with Google Assistant seemed a natural front runner, due to its voice capabilities, and project fi with it's much touted multi Network and Wi-Fi hopping capabilities seemed a good decision as well. Did my due dilligence and the 4G network to all appearances covered me completely, even though I live with my elderly parents in a rural area. The only option available for order at the time was a white Pixel (not XL) and 32gb. I was nervous about the 32 part at the time, but felt comfortable with the infinite backup capability of Google photos. Now, 3 1/2 months later, not only is service spotty, audio crackly despite not being a candidate for replacement under the microphone bug, and Google's customer service... Let us politely say not the most helpful on the issue. I apologize about the length of this comment, (and after reading over it I really should have made it a direct message) but the difference between a phone worth $600 and the phone worth $300 in retail/tradein is quite a big deal to someone like me, and as much as I love my pixel (and admire/fear/respect Google) getting out while the getting is good is starting to sound the smarter move. ( especially after the 180 they made on the 5x.... Grrrrr) Was curious to get an educated opinion on the subject. Thanks again for your ( and anyone else's who has read this far) time and any insight offered! dizel123 Opinion: Even if you can, you probably shouldn't read David Ruddock's articles anymore. Adam Myself having been using the Pixel since day one, I would agree to an extent... Would I go out a purchase a brand new Pixel/Pixel XL for full retail? Of course not! Only because the new iteration is just around the corner. Now, would I go buy a Galaxy S8 or an iPhone 7? No way, wouldn't even consider it! I have switched phones at least every 6 months for the past 3 to 4 years, between Android and iOS operating systems as well... Having said that, the Pixel has been the best phone and best experience that I have had to date! This is the first time that I haven't thought about what phone I want to get next, and to be honest there would have to be significant improvements for me to even get the newest iteration when it comes out this fall. This phone as just been that good. To sum things up... I would not buy the Pixel/Pixel XL right now at full retail cost, I definitely would NOT go out and buy a Galaxy S8 or an iPhone either... If you, like myself, really love the Pixel line and want to get one and don't already own one. I would suggest trying to hold out and get the newest release this fall. It's most definitely worth the wait! D13H4RD2L1V3 Google always seems to have issues with stocking ever since the Nexus days. Pretty embarrassing that it's still hard to get a hold of one after 6 months. Probably due for a small price cut soon, as newer phones roll out. me me yeah I loved Nexus back with Nexus 4, 5, 7. Now the Nexus banner is carried by the likes of Moto G, OnePlus.... H2OSKI So true. The bluetooth issues alone nearly make this phone unusable. Drops and cutout's every 20 seconds. Get this, my Pixel was fine UNTIL Google sent out "the server side" update to fix the Bluetooth issues my phone never had!!! Thanks Google. Mine is going back this week. Great camera crap bluetooth. I take pics occasionally​ but I need to use a bluetooth headset hours a day. Multiple headphones, headsets, and vehicle connections with all the same result...even in safe mode. Fail. Daishi Google shot themselves in the foot when they gussied up an HTC 10 and called it a Pixel. It is just any other Android phone and doesn't have the support behind it to justify the price. Six months along, it should be more than 50% off. William Ross Why the hell is this idiot comparing a 6 month old device to the newer releases? A year in smartphone years is a lifetime. That being said, the pixel still has the best most up to date software bar none! The camera is still among the best if not the best. And, although the 835 is a newer processor, the 821 is no slouch. GTFOH with this garbage article. And, I'll definitely be getting the next Pixel regardless of price. And, I'll sell my original on eBay for a pretty penny. And, this baby has no scratches any where. It's always been in a case and all glass has been protected by Liquid Armor. diggie Pixel is a $650+ phone built like a budget chinese phone. And sorry, Oneplus has Google beat on OS features while keeping "stock" feel. William Ross Oh here we go again with the one plus fans always hating on the pixel. If your phone is so great then why knock the pixel? I just don't get it. Just talk about how great your actual Chinese knockoff is. No need to hate in the Pixel. The one plus has little more than a cult following and mock my words, it'll never be a mainstream device. me me Android Police and a lot of its customers are hating the Pixel. The OnePlus fans just chime in. I own a OP3T. It simply works, yep even Bluetooth. When take tax into account, its about half the price. OnePlus fans biggest concern: price creep upwards. $300 becomes $350 becomes $390 becomes.... Goblin Shark Is this article from April 1st? Absolutely no one with any knowledge of phone tech recommended a Pixel, ever! Underspeced and overpriced, I doubt there's any trouble keeping them in stock they just know nobody wants them so they're not making any. Rod Under-spec'ed? Ok Underperforming? Nope Edgar Morales I honestly don't see what the problem is I purchased my pixel XL and have not to date had any issues whatsoever with it no Bluetooth issues no speaker issues nothing everyone is saying Michael Hannigan Hey, if you get a phone you love and it lasts just under a year, that's good enough. What more do you expect for a few hundred bucks. Appreciate the year you loved that thing and then replace it with a new one that you can love even more. Tom Takumi Okamoto OnePlus is a better phone maker than Google. A company not even 1% worth of Google. I really want a Pixel but it's not practical. Ionut Lala I'm sorry but that is clearly not a first generation device. Not the first from Google (made by HTC and let's not forget about the Nexus line). And not the first from HTC (for obvious reasons). Aquan Belk I wish other Android manufacturers went to stock Android. I know Samsung shines in it's own apps on top of Android but vanilla Android still is and always will be the best. Rod You heard the man, people. Don't buy a Pixel because it will have bad resale value and won't be updated for long. Instead, get a model that will have bad resale value and won't be updated for long, plus has worst performance, buggy software and worse camera performance. You're welcome. Stephonz My last Google phone was Nexus 5. As much as I like pure Android experience, Google has a bigheaded trend in phones. The price point was my biggest no no after the 5X. They don't offer as much features as the other well known Android companies.. amir80 I have a Pixel 32 gb and I really really like it. Everything works great and the camera is amazing and also the battey life. For me, the fingerprint sensor is a must. The S8 sensor is poorly located and the G6 sensor is too small. GeorgeDao123 Absolutely. The Pixel duo are 2 pieces of $#!¶. They run pure Android version and they are so slow to boot up and open apps though they are lag-free. Neru Nexus I've had a pixel since launch day. For one I don't agree with the bluetooth issues. Keep the phone up to date or use the bluetooth connect and play app to automate things. Second it is a over priced phone but so is an iPhone. The main reason real users should get a pixel is the updates. Sure you might need to learn something about that expensive piece of tech you bought and not just sit on your hands waiting for the apples or googles of the world to update your shit, but at least google gave us source code, kernel code and a unlocked bootloader. There are still updates being made for the old nexus 5, that's like 5 years old. Grab iphone 4s and tell me again about how fucking great those updates are lol. You can't even install apps like skype or whatsapp that thing is pooched. I can promise the world that even if google stops updating the pixel in 2018 there will be updated versions of the os you can manually install for years. Let's see if you can get more then one firmware update on your fancy new samsung s8. My money is on 1, then the s9 will launch a year later and samsung just won't care about the s8. rjcuk What if you want a slightly smaller phone? The S8 is 5.8" compared to the Pixel at 5". I really struggle to hold 6" phones. Even the Nexus 5X at 5.2" was too big to grip properly and comfortably. Janoo Ramachandran DON'T BUY A PIXEL. We have 2 Pixels at home. One bought early November 16 and the other end Jan 17. The one I was gifted this January, within 40 days had microphone related issues. I could not hear anyone on the phone, nor was the music being played out. They refused a replacement. My phone sat in the repair centre for 8 plus day and the mother board replaced. Have you ever heard of a new phone device of any other brand needing a mother board replacement in leads than 45 days WELL GOOGLE PHONE PIXEL NEEDED IT. The other phone bought early November 16 started having other issues last month and it wasn't recognizing the wifi. After at least 20 hours on the phone with the terrible google support, it had to be sent to the repair centre where it was kept for 2 weeks, you heard that right 16 days to be precise. Then the phone came back with a chip replaced. SHOULD YOI BUY A PIXEL EVER. :. NEVER SHOULD YOU LOOK AT GOOGLE AS A PHONE MAKER :. NEVER Nikhil I wholeheartedly concur here. I picked up a Pixel sometime around December which had to be promptly returned for a replacement as the volume rocker was rickety. The replacement didn't last long either. Within a month, the widely acknowledged microphone issues popped up and after almost 15 days of talking to the very incompetent Google support in India, their only resolution was to take the Pixel to the service center. The service center did not have the motherboard in stock (they had to bring it all the way from Taiwan) and my phone still languishes there even after 15 days of me submitting it. The phone suffers from not only just Gen-one product issues, but also terrible after sales support. Leonardo Baez Agree.... ait for the next generation THEN buy current generation cheaper. Jeremy Allan Actual customer service? You do realize that owners of a pixel get free 24/7 support any time, on a dedicated line for pixel owners? Exalm There is the same section in the settings on Nexus 5X and 6P. No idea whether it works, since there's no chat or phone support in Russia neither for Nexus nor Pixel. Cory Wilson I agree. Granted it was around a year ago I bought my 6p but the 6p didn't cost $870 either. Still don't regret that decision Impulse_Vigil Haven't really had any serious Pixel Bluetooth issues here... A handful of times (literally less than half a dozen) BT shut itself off back in Feb-March, hasn't happened again since the Play Services patch. I use Bluetooth on a daily 24/7 basis too with my ZenWatch 3, car audio, etc. I don't push it to its range limits tho. Dunno whether David's usage and issue is some sorta edge case, or range related, or whether he was speaking to the 1-2 month period when others were having more severe Bluetooth shut off issues. I do agree with the overall sentiment tho, Google hasn't made it easy to buy the Pixel and that's simply inexcusable. I haven't had to suffer thru any of the QC issues (no BT, mic, whatever issues here, knock on wood) but it seems they weren't handled super well either. To be honest I wouldn't even recommend the S8 to anyone either unless it's another geek/enthusiast, these days for most people it's simply not worth it to spend that kind dosh on a phone. I bought my mother a Moto Z Play; I'd probably point others towards that, the OP3, or an HTC One/S7 on sale. I'm super happy with my Pixel, but if there was a OnePlus 3-class device for Zoglog Having owned a pixel XL and now a s8+, I'd have to agree. Even not taking into account the questionable hardware reliability of the pixel (mine died in 5 months). Basically when I owned the pixel I loved the hell out of stock Android but I kept on wondering why I paid so much for it. Meanwhile with the S8+ the gorgeous screen makes it feel especially special and worth the price. Even though I would prefer stock Android 10000% sebastianer Pixel is just another Nexus. Like the 6P. There is no excuse, this is not their first premium phone. Still made by HTC instead of Huawei. And called Pixel instead of Nexus...and more expensive because of HTC and all the marketing costs. And..still has the shitty compass all their recent previous nexus had with a lot of topics open in Google product forums and staff giving tons of manuals about how to perfect calibrate something that doesn't retain calibration. But the main reason I wouldn't buy a Pixel...is the compass and secondly that you will get one more android update if you wait 6 months. username_not_valid How is the pixel the first 'in-house Google phone'? Its clearly and actually a slightly rehashed HTC. HTC doesn't just make it ,they designed it for all intents and purposes. Unless Googles design strategy happens to be exactly like HTCs then its not a Google phone. The Pixel is just an over priced nexus, nothing else. SOUL- Always great to see the smartphone community go from praising a phone to outright basing it just after a couple of months. Perfectly fine with my Pixel. Michael Sørensen It's just ... really boring. andy mckenzie It's a superb phone , blazing fast so processor is not an issue , amazing camera , free storage , online support has been fast and efficient in my experience, stock Android , I'd highly recommend to anyone. remister I am still using my 6P, I couldn't swallow the 1K price tag for 128GB with insurance.... Justin Field Yeah, I broke the screen on my 5x, and since I am on Fi I considered getting a pixel for about 2 seconds and ordered and new screen and fixed my phone. I will wait for the next gen or switch off of Fi.

What once was broken now is fixed: call recording in Google Voice works again Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/15 5:56pm PDTApr 15, 2017 30 Plus 1 on G+ 92 Share on Facebook 68 Share on Twitter Total Shares190 Applications Google News Update 1: 2017/04/18 9:22am PDT Looks like recordings from that period are appearing back where they should, nothing to see here. Shortly after bringing it back from the dead, it would appear that Google may have inadvertently broken call recording for a short period. For the last two weeks there have been multiple different user reports of problems with recording calls in Google Voice. Thankfully, the issue appears to have been resolved and recording is now working as intended. While there is not yet any word about the status of recordings presumed lost during this period, all new recordings should behave as expected and appear in your Google Voice inbox. The precise cause of the original problem isn't known. We've reached out to Google for more information. In the meantime Google hasn't made any statements about the matter outside the responses on the forum, so in lieu of an official statement all we can provide is the response given to posts on the subject: Thank you for reporting the issue you had with call recordings. We believe that we have resolved the issue and new call recordings should work as expected. Our engineering team is continuing to investigate the recordings that took place during the time period affected. We will update this thread once we have an update to provide. Thanks for your patience! If you believe you may have been affected, you can check if any of your recordings made during that time are present. If you don't find them in your Google Voice inbox double check by opening the overflow menu on the left, open "Legacy Google Voice," hover over More and select Recorded calls. Recordings should appear there, and if any are missing from the last two weeks you may be among those who have experienced the issue. For those users that might have made recordings while things were broken, it looks like Google is still looking into things and plans on updating the relevant threads later. If we hear anything more on the subject or if we get a statement we'll be sure to update this post.

Carson Saldanha Plz Google, let me use the Assistant to send Google Voice messages. Brad Stewart this is huge for Android Auto users as well. SpeakethTheTruth Hey new guy, nice touch on the thumbnail. Now go fetch me some coffee. Marty Tricky Dick says, "Right on!". keithzg And meanwhile SMS support is being removed from Hangouts (despite Google's assurances that Hangouts wasn't going anywhere, I guess they're just gonna rip out features until folks don't use it anymore and then go "oh, well we were gonna support it forever, but nobody's using it, so..."). And Google Voice still isn't available in Canada after all these years. Dammit, Google. ethd Aroo Morenicano I recommended the article because of the thumbnail. More eyes need to see this lol Erick Wright It would be nice if you could check your recording from the new updated less future Rich app... Or hell use Google Assistant to send messages via Google Voice or make Google Voice your default SMS app... One day Google will get it right or someone else will come alone and do it. Kevin Davis Hell yes, awesome picture. Vivek Rameses Screw the article, that's a great picture. I like the new guy. Doby Gillis Most retards do. Damodara Kovie [dkovie] ...bruh, that's a bit much 🙄 Techsoul It'd be better if they fixed the bug that doesn't allow you to get a new number at all. Mark Sentesy More important to me is that the new app usually claims the phone has no network connection, when it clearly does. This makes it unusable. So I use an old apk, which works perfectly fine. Latheryin With all the different laws around people need to be careful with call recording. Have to make sure you are aware of the laws for each and every state. Other wise might end up on the bad end of a court case. vwnut13 Google Voice announces to both parties that the call is being recorded. Latheryin Which doesn't mean anything in states where is not allowed at all. Never did understand it personally. If you can't remember what was said on a phone call then it is either not that important or your memory just sucks and you have bigger issues. MG Which doesn't mean anything since all states allow call recording, some just require that all parties involved be notified. Call recording has far more use cases than simply jotting down notes Latheryin Not all states do. The one I live in just made it illegal again to record personal calls. I'm sure for some it does. Can't think of any reason myself but for those with bad memories I can see where it would help. vwnut13 And which state would that be? Latheryin Alaska. IT was voted on last week along with a bunch of other privacy laws. You know things like where you can and cant fly a drone, recording people while they are out at events. You know things like that. Like I said I am sure many people find a use for it. Just not something I would ever use or have a use for. needa This is from the current 30th Legislature (2017-2018) Sec. 42.20.310. Eavesdropping. (a) A person may not (1) use an eavesdropping device to hear or record all or any part of an oral conversation without the consent of a party to the conversation; (2) use or divulge any information which the person knows or reasonably should know was obtained through the illegal use of an eavesdropping device for personal benefit or another's benefit; (3) publish the existence, contents, substance, purport, effect, or meaning of any conversation the person has heard through the illegal use of an eavesdropping device; (4) divulge, or publish the existence, contents, substance, purport, effect, or meaning of any conversation the person has become acquainted with after the person knows or reasonably should know that the conversation and the information contained in the conversation was obtained through the illegal use of an eavesdropping device. (b) In this section "eavesdropping device" means any device capable of being used to hear or record oral conversation whether the conversation is conducted in person, by telephone, or by any other means; provided that this definition does not include devices used for the restoration of the deaf or hard-of-hearing to normal or partial hearing. Notice how it only says 'a party to the conversation'. You don't even need to tell the person you are recording. Learjet Agreed. Would be nice to use if you were a reporter doing an interview, otherwise, what else would it be used for? It announces to the receiver that it's recording the conversation, so there's no nefarious way of using it. I'm a heavy and longtime Google Voice user and I've never needed or used it. In fact, until I read this post, I kinda had forgotten about it. Robert Johnson This call may be monitored or recorded for quality assurance, training purposes, marketing data, leaks, foreign blackmail, or national security reasons. Learjet It announces to both parties that the conversation is being recorded, so you can't record someone without their knowledge, which is what is illegal (and rightfully so). Android Developer Pretty sure normal calls are used more. Why can't they put call recording as a standard on Android? I've even made a request for this: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/36705317 aRvInD Thanks for this., I am new to this. Can I voteup for this? Android Developer Yes, please upvote it. You can also create your own suggestions and bug reports there. Just remember to fill all the needed information, and add video/images when possible. Speaking of normal calls, I even requested to show larger image of the contact (because currently it's very small), but they rejected it: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/36705104 :( aRvInD Ok, but how to upvote? I couldn't find any arrow marks to do it..! Android Developer You just press on the star icon on the left of the title: https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/202f8e6fda93b600e49e3ff09414330dc50a6535e482df680ca66861015e1a45.png . You can also comment if you want to add something to what's written, but this doesn't count as upvoting. It's too bad the current UI of the website doesn't allow (or at least I can't find how to do it) to filter by requests. I'm sure many requests of developers and users can be interesting to upvote. Here's another one I made of a basic feature of a phone: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/37310901 It's to handle the annoying notifications of phone (audio) messages people leave you, and you have to call in order to listen and delete them. I prefer it all being managed on the smartphone itself. MikeJwF Hey look at that, a president was impeached/resigned for spying! Should be looked at as more of a trail blazer in hindsight. How ironic. prestonjb I guess this is why my voicemail was so messed up the last months... But now that it's working the is a larger problem... Now i wish I could get Google voice to get the voice mail from my Android Wear lg watch. I want to call forward my phone to my watch and then if I don't pick up on the watch then voice mail goes to Google voice.. but alas I can't get the watch to forward to Google voice.. Ailín Ó’S Non American here. Can someone explain to me the picture? SpeakethTheTruth Google the Watergate Scandal. Ailín Ó’S Enlightening. Cheers. Lucas Cannon Interesting Google Voice now opens with Project Fi. At least for me on my 5X... First time I've seen! Goodbye Hangouts! 😁 Lucas Cannon Nevermind... 😥 mcdonsco I've been wanting to port my number to GV but I'm REALLY worried about something going wrong during the port and losing my number. It's my business number which is tied to a LOT of advertising in addition to just previous/current clients spanning over a decade; would be a DISASTER for me ofming lost it. Anyone do the port from Verizon to GV recently that can share your experience? Amanasatree I'm in the same predicament as you, would love to know of others experience porting from Verizon toGV. Andromedo I did this in 2012, it was painless. I have had things get "weird" during porting NOT involving Google Voice (i.e. between the "major" carriers). Once you get the appropriate people on the phone, they've always been able to "save" it -- for what it is worth, I know AT&T has a dedicated port department that works out of the United States and they are quite capable. I imagine if you had any trouble getting it to Google, you could call Verizon, and swear that you were never going to leave them if they'd just put it back the way it was. You should be fine. Morenicano I don't have any experience with Verizon but I ported my Sprint number over with zero issues... Twice. Elaine L So that's what the problem was! I thought it was user error and lo, though I tried, I couldn't find those voice mails. Thanks, yer Mum. Ryne Hager It should only have messed with recordings. As long as things are set up correctly your voicemails should be working. If it's still being weird let me know. MisterAlex I haven't been able to record a Google Voice call in ages. You're supposed to just be able to press 4 during a call, right? Is it because I use Hangouts for my calls?

Apple and Facebook will in the coming days add evidence that tech behemoths command an ever widening share of consumer time and spending. Amazon's revenue soared as shoppers favoured it over brick-and-mortar stores, while Google parent Alphabet reported surging quarterly profit that highlighted the ubiquity of its search advertising business – especially on smartphones. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link The states are fighting over where Amazon's Australian operations will be headquartered. Photo: Reed Saxon "Each has built unique moats that allow them to continue to dominate," said Ben Schachter, an analyst at Macquarie. "For Google, no one can catch them on search because of the technology and intellectual property. For Amazon, scale is their friend and no one can compete on selection, price and fulfillment capabilities." The companies have vast networks of complementary products that feed off one another to generate more sales, making it ever harder for competitors to keep up. "Given the strength of Google and Amazon, we think Facebook is likely to look similar," Schachter said. On Wednesday, Facebook is expected to report first-quarter profit of US$2.57 billion, up 70 per cent from a year earlier, while revenue climbs 45 per cent to $7.82 billion, according to analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Advertisement When Apple reports fiscal second-quarter earnings on Tuesday, sales are expected to climb 5 per cent to US$53 billion. Revenue from the App Store and other services such as Apple Music will likely jump 20 per cent to $7.2 billion, according to UBS analyst Steven Milunovich. "The general theme that the big are getting bigger" applies to Apple's self-feeding ecosystem, Schachter said. Every time Apple sells an iPhone, the customer buys apps and other services, feeding data such as photos and contacts into the device, making it harder to swap for a competitor's device. Higher margin service revenue then feeds back into Apple's development budget, helping it build more advanced products to sell to the same consumer. Google's advertising business is very different, but has similar self-feeding qualities. The company got 97 per cent of mobile paid search clicks in the US in the first quarter of 2017, according to client data from digital marketing firm Merkle. That was up from 82 per cent in the same period in 2014. With more searches, Google gets more ad dollars to reinvest to keep its search engine ahead of the competition – mostly represented by Microsoft's Bing. Google also gets more data on what results people click on, which can be used to improve its software even more, and keep people coming back to find information. "There are clear benefits to that scale," Mark Ballard, senior director of research at Merkle, said. "There's that feedback loop." No one can catch Google on search Ben Schachter, analyst at Macquarie For advertisers, Google's large online audience makes it one of the first places to go to run online marketing campaigns. The other is Facebook. Merkle client spending on Facebook ads was up 71 per cent in the first quarter, from a year earlier. These advertisers get about 70 per cent of their online traffic from Facebook and that hasn't changed in recent years despite the rise of competitors like Snap, Ballard noted. Facebook and Google captured 77 per cent of US digital ad spending last year, up from 72 per cent in 2015, according to a recent analysis of data from the Interactive Advertising Bureau by Pivotal Research Group. For advertisers it's "easier to concentrate budgets with a smaller number of players. It's easier to manage," said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal. Marketers have long griped about the "duopoly" atop digital advertising. But they keep giving Google and Facebook money. That's largely because few other places offer wide reach, channels for targeting consumers and better returns. Those advantages only multiply as the tech companies expand. Verizon's new Oath ad business "may figure out a special sauce, but they will never be the first port of call," Wieser said. When Google and Facebook get those calls first, they see what advertisers plan to spend elsewhere and can sell them other services and tools, according to the analyst. Advertisers disagree about what company could offer a viable third alternative. Some suggest another internet titan: Amazon. The largest online retailer isn't a leading digital advertising destination yet, but on its earnings call last week, Chief Financial Officer Brian Oslavsky reported "consistent growth" from that business. Research firm EMarketer expects the company to generate more display ad revenue than Twitter Inc. by next year. Even so, most of Amazon's first-quarter revenue gains came from grabbing retail market share as more people shop online, rather than in stores. That shift is fuelling a record pace of retailer bankruptcies this year, despite a growing US economy and solid consumer spending. What began with bookstores, movie rental outlets and electronics retailers like Borders, Blockbuster and Circuit City, is spreading to apparel and sporting goods chains like Aeropostale and Sports Authority. Once online spending in a category passes 20 per cent, it's tough for brick-and-mortar retailers to survive and easy for Amazon to gobble up market share, said Guru Hariharan, chief executive officer of Boomerang Commerce, which designs software for large retailers. Amazon has been disciplined about only pursuing retail categories that are already shifting online, giving it momentum against competitors playing defense, he said, adding that more apparel bankruptcies will come in the next two years. Like Google, which has introduced the Pixel smartphone to help secure its direct relationship with consumers, Amazon has introduced the Echo smart speaker to encourage customers to buy services and products from its website. The software makers are expanding into hardware to feed their money machines. Bloomberg Advertisement HuffPost Australia An Artificial Womb Has Successfully ...

Opinion: Even if you can, you probably shouldn't buy a Google Pixel anymore David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/05/01 2:09pm PDTMay 1, 2017 66 Plus 1 on G+ 263 Share on Facebook 60 Share on Twitter Total Shares389 Editorials Pixel Pixel XL The Google Pixel is a notoriously hard phone to get a hold of. Persistent stock issues have plagued Google's first "in-house" handset from day one, and things really are little to no better six months after the launch event. Honestly, it's a bit embarrassing just how consistently incompetent Google seems to be at keeping a reasonable inventory of phones available for purchase. But setting that aside, as one of the Pixel's most ardent evangelists, I think there's something it's probably time for me to come clean on: Even if you could buy a Pixel today, I really think you shouldn't. The Pixel is a product with generation-one product issues. The Bluetooth performance is horrid. It's not waterproof. The bezels really are due for a shrink. I don't think the exterior coating on the black and blue variants is of a particularly high quality. The glass window gets scuffed up incredibly easily. The Snapdragon 821 is officially old news. And it doesn't support proper advanced network features across all four of the big US carriers. There are other flaws I could point to, and while none of them are too terrible, they do speak to the slightly-rushed development cycle this phone seems to have been subjected to. Sure, Google got some things astoundingly right: the performance, the camera, the larger software experience. In fact, I think the Pixel is easily the best Android smartphone ever for these strengths, at least if we're talking about me personally as a user (your mileage, obviously, may vary). But for all the great, smooth, fast, clean, pure, simple, natural, and various other adjective-members singing in the Pixel-praise cavalcade, this phone is not the one to buy right now. For starters, Google continues to ask what is an increasingly laughable amount of money for the model most of us want - the 128GB XL - at a staggering $870. Sure, Apple charges the same for an iPhone 7 Plus 128GB, but I'm under no illusion that this comparison in any way favors Google. The iPhone comes with Apple customer service (with actual stores), a longer software support period going forward, and runs no real risk of poor resale value. The Pixel? Google's online support is iffy at best, we know the phone will be unsupported by October 2018, and I have a strong feeling generation-one Pixel resale values will drop like a rock once the new phones are announced. And that really is why, if you haven't pulled the trigger on a Pixel yet, you should just wait. It's overpriced, under-supported, and competing phones like the Galaxy S8 offer a whole lot more technology for your money. The Galaxy S8+ is $20 less than a 128GB Pixel XL, and I would argue it is far and away the better smartphone value. That amazing display, brand-new Snapdragon 835 processor, jaw-dropping design and packaging, and the full support of all our American carriers' latest LTE advancements could each be a reason on its own to put the Galaxy S8 above Google's smartphone. Do I still prefer using the Pixel over the S8? Sure. But I wouldn't buy a 128GB Pixel XL over a Galaxy S8+ today. That would be, frankly, a bit silly. If Google was asking $670 and not $870, the discussion would probably change, but they aren't. You've got to pay full price, and there's no way I could recommend anyone do that. If you're still on the fence about the Pixel, let me try to push you over: wait for the next generation. I realize that this sort of thinking can devolve into a rationale that encourages you to never upgrade anything because something newer, faster, and better is constantly on the horizon. But in this case, I think it's a consideration that is worth weighing more seriously than usual. Many of the Pixel's biggest flaws relate to Google's inexperience producing a smartphone. Issues that only come up as you try to mass-produce and distribute a product with a real marketing campaign that creates real demand, and the phone gets into the hands of "real" users who aren't part of the now-derailed Nexus phone hypetrain. Inside Google, expectations were no doubt managed, realities realized, and priorities accordingly re-calibrated after this first launch. (Side note: if the Bluetooth performance on the next Pixel is as bad as the first one, I may scream, Google.) Meanwhile, the things that make the Pixel great aren't going anywhere. The next Pixel will be fast, it will take great photos, and it will offer a wonderfully unfettered Android experience. Those that make it less than great? Google is no doubt drilling down through the worst of them in order to ensure the Pixel 2 - or whatever it's called - won't make the same mistakes that the original did (waterproofing, please). And one of the primary reasons to try the Pixel in the first place - to be on the very bleeding edge - really only remains true from a software standpoint. Older phones like the Nexus 5X and 6P don't even let the Pixel have an advantage there, as they're on the same update track until around the time the next Pixel phones launch. If you absolutely need a smartphone soon and the Pixel is tempting you, ask yourself this: Can you deal with a Moto G5 Plus for six months if it means having a better Pixel down the road? While as a reviewer I have the admitted luxury of not needing to consider such things, were I in such a position, I'd have little in the way of a counterargument to offer. Sure, you'll take a resale hit on anything you buy now, but the Pixel is going to face a much, much steeper devaluation curve in that time than any budget phone. Buying a Pixel right now just doesn't make sense. I love my Pixel XL, but I'm officially done recommending the phone to friends and relatives. Instead, I'll tell them to wait, or to get the Galaxy S8 they were probably going to buy anyway. Tags editorial google pixel google pixel xl opinion pixel xl subscribe ...

Google really shot themselves in the foot with availability. My name is…. No, they shot their foot with huge bezels, with lack of waterproof, lack of dual speakers, no real camera progress compared to nexii, meh battery life, meh screen. No real selling point besides being pure android phone. This phone had iphone price but was worst on so many levels (no A10 SoC, no iphone-fast NAND, no 4yrs updates) Oneplus on the other hand........ M. Luciano Also has none of that stuff, but is cheaper? My name is…. yes, half price cheaper. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ The black screen issue kind of negates anything else ;) Michael Hannigan What's the "black screen issue"? Carson Saldanha YOU WANT THE PIXEL TO HAVE THE A10 CHIP?? BHAAAAAAAHAHAHA My name is…. No, i want it to have a cheaper price, or be better somehwere else, like the Galaxy. STOP BEING RUDE Carson Saldanha https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CYF7C6hVAAAKF-_.jpg Tr3ple Shut up troll ,nobody likes you I see lmao My name is…. You know when you see the dumb guy, he always adds 'lol' or 'lmao' at the end of his sentence. And his syntax is always wrong. STFU and GTFO Liam Bulkley "You know when you see the dumb guy... And his syntax is always wrong." "You are an [sic] ignorant" Don't cut yourself on the glass. Michael Hannigan They have that - The Nexus 5x. Тарас Мукин You keep hating Pixel in the comments, but you only look at numbers. But they doesn't matter when it comes to Google. Software experience does. My name is…. That's a stupid argument Тарас Мукин And saying that somebody's argument is stupid without any explanation is a much smarter argument. My name is…. Would you pay 900$ bucks for Nexus 5 just because "Software experience matters"?? Carson Saldanha Nobody said they were paying just for the "software experience" Matt Tapac said that specs don't matter, the software experience does. That heavily implies that people are paying for the software experience. Carson Saldanha xD here we go again drunken_bastard Pixel and Pixel XL have better cameras and screens than any iPhone. The difference in SoC and other bits of hardware, they don't translate into any real world speed differences. Pixel also has great battery life. Perhaps some hands on time may do you some good. supersanborn Given that they continually sell out of the limited stock they have, none of what you cited matters. If they had a ginormous supply of units and THEN couldn't sell, then perhaps you would be on to something. My name is…. What was the availability in the first place? You think they produced many? No way Jose, i bet Galaxies and iphones outsold pixels by multiple times supersanborn We don't exactly know what they had hoped to produce or even what they actually produced, so your point remains conjecture. And who here is suggesting that Samsung and Apple phones didn't outsell the Pixel? My name is…. * by multiple times James Betti Sadly, Google isn't keeping the Pixel in stock because they don't care about their hardware line. Google makes most of its money through ads and personal data. It's a shame, but it explains why they discontinue successful products and barely have much in stock. Excellent phone by the way. Michael Hannigan Well, that's easy to rectify. Do like Amazon and offer the same exact hardware with "special offers" for a lower price. Then you get to see ads everywhere, even your home screen and app drawer. Pretty cool. Michael Hannigan Yes, they did. It was in the millions. Max "no real camera progress compared to nexii, meh battery life, meh screen." Ok, so you don't have a Pixel, we get it. My name is…. I'm not dumb, do you get that too? Xchris I think the consensus here is that you are talking bollocks. The pixel XL has an unbelievably good screen, one of the best battery life figures, still has the best camera out of any smartphone. Nobody who bought the pixel cares that much about any of your other points. In fact, what you are really saying is that you didn't like the pixel. Big deal! My name is…. Actually, i'm fighting the pixel in a nerdy community. Its expected that the consensus is that "i am talking bollocks". People here mainly wanna root their phones and put center clocks on status bar. they did the same with Nexii devices, its all about the software, but those phones were seriosly lacking (i used to own all Nexus devices after 4) Carson Saldanha So may I ask, what phone do you use now? My name is…. 1+3 Carson Saldanha Srsly!?!? Bruh, the OnePlus 3 has a Snapdragon 820 while the Pixel has a 821, a far better camera, better performance, and software. How is the OP3 better than the Pixel? Besides the price? I could probably understand if you had the OP3T, but no way. My name is…. You are an ignorant. 1) Check the speedtests, 1+3 is faster (because better nand) 2) Software is better on 1+3 (aosp with tiny mods) 3) Pixel has underclocked 821, thus 820 with a little bit of better battery life (1+3 has 1080p screen to tie this up) 4) 1+3 has 6gb ram (will be good for 4 years) 5) 1+3 is smaller than pixels, unbelievably thin 6) 1+3 has dash charging (world leading) 7) 1+3 has half the price 8) 1+3T is another story, far better Apply cream to the burn, son PS Yes Pixel has a better camera. Carson Saldanha Ignorance at it's finest. My name is…. Those are all FACTS, son. My name is…. Where are you, son? Jack Smith Have you ever even used a Pixel? Only Android phone i have used with zero touch lag. Can we also stop the name calling? Mason Andrew Maseda Hate to break it to you man. I own The One Plus 3T the Google Pixel the Nexus 6P and the Moto X pure edition. Lol. Guess witch one is my daily driver? The Pixel. Why? Better battery . Better cam. All around the most reliable phone. Even with my Nexus 6P I've had some issues here and there tiny ones. Like some days my battery life was abnormally shit and the next day it was great. The one plus 3T has tiny issues too. The Pixel is a phone that you wouldn't understand UNLESS YOU TRY ONE FOR A DAY. come back when you do. tansuperman Not sure why people think the pixel takes good pics. I have a pixel xl, 950xl, IPhone 7plus, and now the s8. In my opinion the pixel xl takes the worst pics. The lumia 950xl is stop dog. The pixel I can tell is just too overprocessed Michael Hannigan I think it applies mostly to low light pictures - absolutely nothing touches the Pixel in that respect - trust me. More generally, it applies to the software and hardware working together to create stunning (real) HDR pictures. But in low.light, which according to a friend of mine who is a smartphone camera freak (I am not), quality of low light pictures are what users are primarily interested in because he says "...any recent smartphone can take great pictures in daylight.". For me, I liked the flexibility of the V20 camera - not just the dual lenses, but the absolutely fantastic functions in the camera app. D13H4RD2L1V3 Um, the 821 consumes less power than the 820 at the lower clocks due to a more efficient binning process. Also, both the Pixel and OP3 use UFS 2 controllers. But on Nougat, the 3 uses F2FS for its filesystem. It's not a case of better NAND. It's a case of different filesystems. Michael Hannigan I think they should use FAT16. I miss it. Chris Rey I will say the Axon 7 is just as good as the OnePlus 3 and looks better. Suicide_Note The Pixel camera is definitely superior to what was in the 6P, and i say that as someone who currently owns them both. M. Luciano I use both on a daily basis. Agree with you 100%. So do objective measurements of the cameras. Pixel is the best on the market; 6P is decent but not great. andy_o On paper both cameras should be just short of identical, but the Pixel is so much faster in processing cause of the HVX dedicated core, plus the N6P throttles like crazy (in one of my photospheres tests in a warm room the Nexus 6 beat it every time). This is crucial especially with Google who is prioritizing computational photography probably on par or more with hardware camera specs. Also, I'm not sure if this is a hardware or artificial limitation, but HDR+ auto has completely different behavior on the Pixels. I can understand how someone who has only looked at the specs and not used a Pixel and N6P (especially in the summertime), can think that there's been "no real camera progress", but this guy is balls-deep in the "arrogance of ignorance". Michael Hannigan I think the reason for the difference in HDR+ in the Pixel is that it's" real HDR - it takes several pictures and then layers them. Other phones have taken a shortcut do doing that with one picture and it really doesn't achieve the same. Except in one case - manually setting HDR in my Note 7 gave absolutely stunning night time photos. Something I can't quite achieve with the built in software on the Pixel (but can with Photoshop). andy_o I was talking the difference between HDR+ auto in the Pixel and HDR+ auto in the previous phones. The auto behavior in the Pixel is different, but the HDR+ processing is basically the same. There's more info here: http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/11/21/deep-dive-closer-look-google-pixels-camera/#What_does_HDR_do If you feel nerdy enough I can link you to a paper on HDR+ by the Google computational photography team too :) Regarding the other phone cameras, the reason they do worse isn't exactly that they they're taking shortcuts, it's actually because they're doing it the traditional way, taking different exposures. Read the AP article linked above for details on how HDR+ is fundamentally different. Michael Hannigan You have OLED burn-in? I have about 8 hours SOT/day and don't have any. That would piss me off. Jason B Inverting colors for a bit while doing some extended reading helps. Black background with white text is easier on the eyes too. But yeah, static nav bar and notification area aren't great for OLED. There should be auto pixel shift to prevent it ... or Google should make more use of Immersive Mode. whispy_snippet Ugh. Like a broken fucking record here sometimes. Shawn Spring While some of your other points may/may not be valid, to say that the Pixel had "no real camera progress compared to nexii" just makes you sound ignorant. The S821 ISP alone would make the camera in the Pixel superior, not to mention the updated HDR algorithms. Get a Pixel owner and a 6P owner in the same room (I was both) and ask them to shoot with each others phone and see who prefers which. The 6P camera lag in HDR mode was inefficient at best and unbearable at worst. And it wasn't that long ago that OnePlus was using a broken invite system, had people lick their phones, and had a horribly gender insensitive marketing campaign. I'd probably not hold them up as the standard bearer against Google. Michael Hannigan They had people lick their phones? Why did they never ask me to do that? That's discrimination. I should have been asked to lick my phone. Brett Lewis I love my pixel after coming from a HTC 8x on Windows platform. Never liked Apple and never will. And lately after all the talk of Samsung's products (blowing up, red screens, other problems) I'm quite happy with my pixel. I don't need water proofing I'm not an idiot that takes my phone near water.. the I hardly notice the bezels after coming from a 4.3 inch 720 display.. The htc8x had one of the widest angle front cameras but I dont take selfies. This pixel does what I want and is fast doing it. And for first time experiencing Android I'm quite happy with buying this with the newest and best version available. TheHater So only idiots take their phones near water? I bet if you had a water resistant phone, you'd take it near water. Michael Hannigan What about the toilet? Who doesn't read the news when sitting on the shitter? Mariano Moreira I would definitely agree in terms of the Pixel XL vs iPhone 7 plus comparisons (Non-32GB model) Comparing the base iPhone 7 vs base Pixel...the iPhone 7 base had(has) slow Nand performance from what I have witnessed. The 32GB iPhone 7 vs base 32GB Pixel (5") seems like a closer comparison where the compromise is better battery life on the Pixel, faster Nand, and better screen. Again, I concur that looking at the Pixel XL vs iPhone 7 Plus leans more heavily towards Apple especially when comparing the 128GB models. Michael Hannigan If you buy from the Google store, they are carrier agnostic - absolutely 0 carrier bloatware. Mariano Moreira No. I have a Google Play(Bootloader unlocked) purchased Pixel. Normally used on Sprint or At&t. When I activate on Verizon: to get Vo-LTE calling with Verizon SIM and certain carrier settings it does a software update switching the phone over to the Verizon specific software build. If it was truly Carrier-agnostic it wouldn't force a Carrier specific Software build onto my non-Verizon model Pixel. Michael Hannigan You must have either bought it from Verizon or screwed something up. An unlocked phone doesn't suddenly become carrier specific like you describe Mike John Quincy Adams I don't one person who owns or says ’I sure wish I had a OnePlus.' Michael Hannigan I have - when I had the OnePlus One. Many people asked me about it. You can't deny that OnePlus phones offer an unbeatable value. They don't skimp on specs and sell for half the.price they should. asrat_24 I get you're trying to make fun of that guy but don't make ignorant statements while trying to do it. Oneplus makes good phones and people are interested enough nowadays to say that. Major Sceptic Agree on all points , a mid range device with a flagship price , perhaps Google will adjust the prices on the 2 ? for a company trying to expand it's phone sales it's going a funny way about it . Artem Russakovskii Well, usually at that point you start seeing significant discounts, but the Pixel is a misnomer in that regard to due to low stock and high demand. Max Exactly, I would revise that affirmation to state: "I've always felt once we are less than 6 months from the new iteration, it's a mistake to buy the existing product *at full price*." supersanborn I'll grant there's a case to be made for some phones where waiting can result in substantial discounts (especially from HTC/LG/etc). Probably a little of my bias sneaks in here. I prefer to have the newer device, and if I waited 6 months post-launch, it probably means I myself need to wait until the next launch. Max I'm with you there, I usually buy a phone at launch or a couple of months later at most but remember that we aren't regular customers, that's why we read and comment on this site ;). For many people out there it makes more sense to buy a phone six months after release if it comes with a nice worthy discount. M. Luciano This ^^ supersanborn Agreed, for some, shaving $100-200 off the price is all that matters. I usually caution folk pretty hard in the last 3 months before the new iteration drops if they have any form of new feature/size/color envy. supersanborn And yeah, I'm nowhere near the "normal" consumer :-) needa Supposed to be picking up a 32gb XL (Google) for $450 near mint in a couple hours. I might not get it, but a killer deal nonetheless. M. Luciano Smash that deal :) Very nice. needa A few little scratches on the back glass. Profit.

The lowest I've seen on Swappa was $695 for a black XL. supersanborn True. I usually find that the discounts are kind of on the "meh" side though until we hit release of new product. I always basically tell folks that you either buy it at launch until about 6ish months post-launch, and if you've held off that long, you should just wait until next launch and either buy the old product at a big discount or buy the new one. Matt I believe your use of misnomer was a bit of a misnomer. Artem Russakovskii I did use the wrong word, you're right. el_smurfo That's why I just picked up a 6p last year for $400. Most expensive smartphone I've ever bought, but the full release price was just not in my budget. Karly Johnston Battery issues? MisterAlex Maybe an anomaly... but not a misnomer. paxmos Where is this high demand you guys talk about?, I have yet to see a pixel in anyone's hand M. Luciano Really? I know over a dozen people who have or had them. paxmos Yep...I see lots of iPhones and Sammy's, even one Blackberry Z30, have only seen a pixel in the Verizon store. M. Luciano I feel like a nerd owning 4 Major Sceptic It does seem to have more of an enthusiast following , no shortage of pixels in my region , the usual brands , apple, Samsung, still seem to have the sales , I know not one person that has a pixel or wants one , and I think Google only has itself to blame on that front, Re : the cost of a pixels . Goblin Shark Finally, someone who knows what they're taking about - my head is just shaking in disbelief reading what these marshmallow brains that think they know about phones are saying on this comment thread lol Daishi Exactly. I have yet to see a Pixel in the wild. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ To be fair, HTC isn't used to such a high demand for their phones. Google unfortunately paid the price Daishi This made me LOL! A post full of WIN for sure!! Zoglog Actually it's probably because of all the RMA's they've gotten JD Thought that was obvious. syxbit I wonder whether we shouldn't wait for Pixel + 2. The next Pixel may technically be the first Google made product (current Pixel is made by HTC), so it's possible the Pixel 2 will have first gen problems. Still, I still have the N6P (after I scoffed at the Pixel price and refused to buy it), so I going to be looking for a phone soon. Good_Ole_Pinocchio HTC is also manufacturing the Pixel 2. Word on the street. Daishi That's too bad. I'll avoid this this phone as well... Captain On! Well, technically the iPhone is made by Foxconn, so... Don't expect Google to actually build their own facilities to produce hardware. Carson Saldanha Pretty sure they'll still be using HTC. Might have more control over the design this time around though. 4Ui812 The availability issue is a play out Nintendo's handbook. Good_Ole_Pinocchio 100% agree with the entire article... Do I want the Pixel Software Experience and Camera? Yes... But not when the new version is a few months away thag would probably fix all the issues I see posted on this site ever so often...starting with the Bluetooth issues. I got an S8... Because it's the only phone thay makes sense to me right now..... I'll see what Google is doing in the fall Max Johnson If the Moto G5 Plus had NFC I would have no problem making it my Android daily driver for the next 6 months. wade_county Moto Z Play and OP3/OP3T are other options with NFC. shadowx360 I used to buy 1 generation old Nexus devices to get around the cost issue, but it seems the 5X and 6P both are plagued by serious phone-killing issues. Now that warranty is up on nearly every used 5X/6P, buying used is like trying to navigate a minefield. I don't really trust 1st generation Pixel to not have serious issues either. I'd never use a non-Pixel/Nexus device but I can't buy a Pixel XL knowing Samsung offers so much better hardware at a similar price. wade_county My advice is getting the next OnePlus phone or picking up a used OP3/OP3T. AndrewGM I bought a used Pixel in good shape on eBay, as I couldn't get one from Google Store (already had a wireless provider). Switched from an iPhone 6s, after using almost every iPhone model since and including the original. Much better camera on the Pixel, especially closeups and in low light, and much easier to use overall (especially Contacts vs. iOS), as I've used mostly Google apps for a long time. I like the Google keyboard much better and the Android interface. I'm definitely satisfied with the Pixel and have no real iPhone regrets. It's true there are more apps for the iPhone, but that doesn't matter because the core apps are available on Android too. The only app I miss is Enlight, for photo editing. The one Pixel issue I agree with is the relatively poor resale value vs. iPhones (I assume). Carson Saldanha May I suggest Snapseed for photo editing? (It's developed by Google) Also, do you miss iMessage/FaceTime or is that really a con? AndrewGM Will check out Snapseed, thanks. I've been using Google Photos to lightly edit pics. The Pixel camera is so good that I often don't edit (for Instagram/FB uploads), especially if the light and composition are already good. I don't miss iMessage at all. I had to turn it off and all that stuff for my phone number when I switched, but I'm texting away every day. Emoticons seem to work fine. I don't even think about iMessage. FaceTime has been replaced with Duo for my family members, including those on iPhone. Seems to work fine. And I can share location with family members via Google Maps. I guess that brings up privacy issues vs. using Apple products, but not sure it makes a real-world difference. Battery life, btw, seems pretty good (I charge the phone overnight only). The call quality is a little less than iPhone, maybe, but overall acceptable. AndrewGM Will add that I have had the Pixel for 2 months and use it daily. I like the screen on the Pixel (or at least it never bothers me), and the issue about the "chin" at the bottom being big is a non-issue to me. I don't notice it and in fact hold the phone sometimes there, which is arguably convenient. If the phone continues to hold up, I'll be a customer for Pixel 2 eventually. Eric I was ready to jump to the Pixel XL after returning my second Note 7, but Google never gave me the opportunity to give them my money. Carson Saldanha xD My name is…. It was never a good device. thank you for finally admitting that. Andrew I don't think that's what the author is saying... My name is…. Someone had to be crazy to buy a pixel in the first place. I was bashing on that device from day one. Author, months later, says that the phone is no good. It was never good. Carson Saldanha Lord, would you just chill? Tr3ple I think he's retarded, gotta be it, lol. Must be it actually. Carson Saldanha troll by far Suicide_Note Except that's not at all what the author said, so you're either: A) trolling, B) incredibly dumb, or C) both of the above. Тарас Мукин Of course there's no point in buying Pixel for full price now. And there's more: there's no point in buying any device for it's starting price when it's 3 months old — tech gets old really fast today. And that's the whole point of not buying something at day one — everything gets much cheaper very fast. Samsungs do, LGs too. But Pixel for some reason didn't. And Nexuses were like this too. So — only buying Google devices right after release makes sense. Or buying them unofficially and cheaper. Sad, but true. sraj49 I always like and respect your articles. You put your views straight forward. But I tend not to agree with the tone and content of this article completely. I am living in Home of full Apple products and I own a Pixel XL. I love the Pixel in all aspects. Yes there are room to improvements which is true for everyone. Apple products are well designed, well built. As regards sorry gone are those days when Apple sorry was at is best which was until iPhone 4s/ iPhone 5. Now after the warmth period it is the same as Pixel. I going Pixel after sales support very good. I definitely agree with you on the most inefficient handling of supplies and also this is not the time to buy since meet models are coming. Just to add, I get sick when people say that the Pixel phones are not made by Google but by HTC. Everyone outsources manufacturing. Most of the phone are made by Foxcon staying from Apple. All phone manufacturers only design the hardware, software and the manufacturing is outsourced. Good_Ole_Pinocchio The HTC point that keeps coming up comes from the fact that Google didn't really dsign much hardware hete. They just used HTC parts. It's not the same as hardware being designed by apple then manufactureres elsewhere. andy_o I think he's right on that point. Google support may or may not be good, but it's online only. Apple support is famously good. For instance, the recent fixes for iPhone 6s battery problems. I booked an appointment, went into the store, they told me it would be a bit, went to a coffee shop, they emailed me, picked it up. Another time my iPad mini 2 mute switch broke. Again, appointment, go in the store, got it actually just exchanged on the spot. Google simply cannot do that. JohnyNoLegs What android phones have you owned prior to the pixel? And yes it's a HTC phone through and through. Scofabear Shots fired! I even dumped my 6P for a Moto z play. No regrets Futbolrunner Same here! That 808 was a lag fest. I even got the S8+ but returning it because it can't touch the Play's battery life. Dominic D I just bought a Pixel a month ago. I still would recommend it if you get one for fairly cheaply on swappa. It's awesome. Brian Demodulated My last 3 phones have been Nexus. Each has been less reliable than the last. I love how hackable they are but I think my next phone will be a Samsung Galaxy. Carson Saldanha Elaborate? Wdym by "less reliable" What issues? Brian Demodulated My Samsung Galaxy Nexus was incredible and still works today. My Nexus 5 was garbage - two broke within 1.5 years. My 6P is quirky - it doesn't charge on my home PC and although my wife's updated to 7.1.2 mine says it's up to date at 7.1.1. Tr3ple Get a pixel then, Samsung lol. Brian Demodulated I have my 6P another year. I'll see what's available next year when my contract is up. JohnyNoLegs Bootloops, dodgy updates, requires factory resets, breaks features, slow bug fixes. M. Luciano No offense, but you are not going to increase stability by going to Samsung. Brian Demodulated My old Samsung Galaxy Nexus was the best, highest quality, most reliable phone I ever owned. LG and Huawei's Nexus phones were less stable for me. M. Luciano I had a few of those.. they weren't as reliable. But probably because I did bad things to them. Brian Demodulated I rooted mine, loaded hacky ROMs, and carried it with me everywhere I went for 3 years. The USB and audio cables are a little loose now but otherwise it's saved me when my later Nexus phones crapped out on me. Vitali Galaxy nexus had clean stock rom, it is just Google's clean soft in a Samsung physical device and not with samsung's os Brian Demodulated Every Nexus has the clean stock ROM. It's one of the top reasons why I get them. JohnyNoLegs Going Pixel sure doesn't increase stability. It's less stable than my Note 4/Note 7. Vitali Agree with M. Luciano, but people try should move to Sony. Lookup at speed test videos of their Xperia XZs, it has beaten all smartphones by now, including the Pixel. All the biased big reviewers out there will never tell you the truth, stop thinking the S8 is the best phone in the world.. I recommend you to wait for their Xperia XZ Premium it will have sd835! After you see the XZs speed, I promise you it may be the fastest phone even in 2018. Suicide_Note No. Just...no. Vitali *A wild 8 year old fanboy comment appears* Brian Demodulated Speed isn't that important to me. I've heard bad things about Sony's flavour of Android and that it's bloaty. Vitali So you heard wrong, their software is one of the bests out there, and im talking from experience.. And Samsung have so clean and fast Android that it is just unbelievable.. Where do you get all that info from?? Vitali So you heard wrong, their software is one of the bests out there, and im talking from experience.. And Samsung have so clean and fast Android that it is just unbelievable.. "I've heard.." Where do you get all that info from?? Suicide_Note TW is much better than it used to be, but it's hardly clean and fast. Brian Demodulated I work in a large IT department. One of my buddies told me about it. He said Sony's Android UI was all over the place and annoying to use, and that his handset was 2 major versions behind the latest version of Android OS. dtox Lol don't listen to him, xperia phones are absolute trash. dtox LOL xperia = garbage D13H4RD2L1V3 Um, I'm not entirely sure. Not that I'm ragging Sony, but they haven't exactly been selling for a reason. Even Sony themselves know. I don't hate Sony phones. I personally think they're understated, solid offerings. Problem was that they were really overpriced. After seeing the XZs and XA1, seems like their pricing may have become more logical. We'll see how it goes. I'm personally hoping the XZP may even be a solid device. Not that I'll buy one but if the price is right, it'll be significantly easier to recommend. JSo Experiences differ from person to person. But It's odd the luck you have had with the Nexus devices. I've had the Galaxy Nexus, Nexus 5 and now the Nexus 5X and I have never had an issue with any of them. JohnyNoLegs No battery issues with 5X? My wifes upgraded to 7.1.1 and has never been the same, bluetooth is slow and laggy, and the battery barely gets 1.5-2 hours SOT after it used to get close to 3. Michael Hannigan Dude, you're talking about a crusty old obsolete phone. And unless you are happy getting 2 hours of battery time, you should pry the wallet open and buy something current. Complaining about your old phone won't make you feel better. Replacing it with a working, current phone that's not past it's expected useful life will. JohnyNoLegs Dude, wth are you talking about. It's a 1.5 years old. From new it was getting 4-5, right up until 7.1.1 update. Roy My 6P is the most reliable phone ever. And I had Samsung and HTC. Duder12 The last Nexus phones had bum processors from qc. royrov My Nexus 6P kissed the asphalt a couple of weeks ago, so I bought a perfect Pixel XL second hand (used 3-4 months). Its better, no regrets here. Faster and better battery, hell even snapchat is snappy on it! Tr3ple Exaclty lol, people saying the pixel isn't an upgrade to the 6p are delusional lol. They all like to hate on it u til they get one and realize how good of a phone it is. And all the bugs I've been seeing on the net are nowhere to be found and I had mine for 5-6 months now bekifft I know it's an upgrade. It's just not much of an upgrade for an enormous amount of money. Tr3ple My 6p had serious issues, I went and got a s7 egde(big mistake), the price I paid was well worth it. I'm still financing my s7 egde while I'm using a pixel, this is how much I love this phone. destinyhud I will still buy one Michael Tran If I could give you a phone for free but you had to keep it and use it and couldn't sell it. Which phone would it be? M. Luciano 128 GB Pixel XL, black supersanborn My 128GB Pixel XL in black. At least until the 2 comes and **hopefully** adds waterproofing, 600Mhz support, 4x4MIMO for T-Mobile. If you're reading, Pixel team, let's talk! Orlando aka Pixel XL Samsung Galaxy S8+ blue Tr3ple Gimme a 128 gb pixel XL black any day keithzg The bezels really are due for a shrink. Boy are you gonna rue this when the second-gen comes out and the bezels are the exact same ;) M. Luciano I sorta hope they are :) keithzg You animal! (But honestly, this is why choice is good. I find the desire for those top and bottom bezels incomprehensible, but I can entirely understand that not everyone would feel the way I do, particularly if routinely holding phones very differently.) M. Luciano I just want SOME bezels. They don't need to be huge. Just want a place to put my thumbs when holding it sideways. It's a good place for speakers IMO. Carson Saldanha Nah, to be fair, I think Google's definitely not planning on keeping them the same size if they've listened to the reviews. keithzg I mean, if they'd listened to reviews of many other phones before they put out the Pixels they would have known that too---including, for instance, the previous two generations of Nexus phones . . . So it seems likely that either (a) they know of the opinions of the commentariat and disagree, or (b) they felt technically they couldn't do it. I'm personally hoping it was somehow just (b) but they used (a) to convince themselves that it was an okay sacrifice, but that they won't have to make the same sacrifice again this year and they'll allow themselves to change up the design. But I'm not gonna bet too much money on that. Carson Saldanha Whoa, you lost be there with all those "a's" and "b's" xD Shawn Spring I think its pretty well known at this point that the time frame between when Google's negotiations w/Huawei fell through and when they picked the deal up with HTC was the cause of the "let's use the leftover A9 shells" bezel issue. So more (b) than (a) assuredly. ikeofkc If they do. Peoples' thumb muscles are going to be screwed if they use the pixel 1 handed, constantly trying to reach the back button. The chin makes one handed use possible keithzg See, that's what I mean about different folks and different strokes. I've never noticed it being of any help with my Nexus 6P, for me the top and bottom bezels are completely useless. bekifft If they actually put something useful there, like a front facing stereo speaker, I would be totally fine with that. keithzg Dammit, don't you go making me miss the Nexus 6 again! Michael Hannigan I want them to be bigger. I want to be able to lean on mine when I am standing in line at a movie. MadMartigan I am constantly amazed by the short memories. The author thinks it likely they are likely to have a better launch of P2? They do give the obvious impression that they believe the Pixel to be their first swing and a miss... Funny how quickly we forget, well, nearly every other device Google has ever tried to sell. I personally loved my 4, 10, 5, 6, and 6. But I cannot, while keeping a straight face, argue that one should expect anything better from them regarding inventory management this time around. How many times does Google have to fail on inventory management before we start pointing and laughing at the people who constantly say, "They'll get it right this time, for sure." Don't get me wrong - I would absolutely love it if Google proved me wrong on the P2. I just won't believe it until I see it. //dons flameproof suit// A'ight, I'm ready. Fire away... M. Luciano This is their first swing and a miss, but only because the shortages are for very different reasons than prior devices they sold on behalf of other OEM's. MadMartigan Who...who do you think made the Pixels? M. Luciano Google is the OEM for the Pixel phones (and tablets, and laptops, etc). HTC is the factory putting the phones together. It's a totally different legal and business agreement, and essentially means that Google has to supply most of the components, contracts, contacts, etc. and HTC is essentially an assembly line. On Nexus phones, the OEM was Samsung, or LG or Huawei, etc. and they actually designed and produced the phones, in partnership with and input from Google. Completely different. For those, the partner was able to do all the contracting and sourcing; HTC isn't doing all the work for Google this time. MadMartigan So you don't believe HTC designed the Pixel. Got it. That's all I needed to see. M. Luciano Not sure what that means, but ok. Google is now the OEM, that's what I am saying. Another Scott Nice post. I hemmed and hawed about a Pixel XL 128 for 6 weeks last fall and finally decided I just couldn't do it. Besides the fact that it was impossible to get from Google, I just couldn't justify the price. I decided to finally replace my LG Nexus 4 (roughly $350 new) with a new T-Mobile LG V10 from B&H in November for $330 and am quite pleased. (It would have been $300 a week or so later.) I added a Samsung EVO 128 GB SDHC card for it for $40 or so. I miss the Nexus timely updates a great deal, but I can't see spending a kilobuck on a phone to get it - especially for only a 2 year OS upgrade availability. I hope Google gets the Pixel 2 right, but maybe they figure having a "premium" phone for evangelists is good enough so they won't feel any pressure to make it available (or cut the price). Cheers, Scott. fijisiv The Galaxy S8+ is $20 less than a 128GB Pixel XL Just wow. M. Luciano Right? The Pixel is by far a better value at those prices. 128 GB storage over 16, metal over glass body, better software, better security, better camera, guaranteed to be up to date for 3 years... Samsung has some great components, but as a package, Pixel seems to keep ahead at this point. Matt I believe the S8+ is 64G and has a microSD slot. M. Luciano I think you're right. IMO that makes the Pixel better. Do you prefer less with expandable option? 03grunt I live in the mountains of NC and went back to Verizon once they brought back unlimited data and luckily the local Verizon store had a Pixel XL. I think it's pretty sad that in ~ 18 months the Pixel will be EOL. M. Luciano Luckily, it won't be. Nexus and Pixel devices are guaranteed to be fully up to date for 3 years; not 2. 2 years of major updates and 3 years of security updates = 3 years of being fully up to date. Sir_Brizz That's not entirely true. They are only guaranteed to be on the latest version for 2 years. It's unlikely it will be any different than the Nexus 6 in this regard (which didn't get 7.1 but is still getting monthly security updates). M. Luciano The Pixel and Pixel XL released October 4, 2016. They're guaranteed to be fully up to date until 10/31/2019. That's 1121 days, or 3.07 years. Sir_Brizz No. You are wrong. They are only guaranteed version updates until October 2018. The Nexus 6 was guaranteed the same thing until October 2016. It did not get Android 7.1 even though it continues to get monthly security updates. What this means is that the Pixel will get at least Android 9.0 but that doesn't guarantee it will get 9.1 or 9.2 or anything else past that. It just means it will get 9.0 and monthly security updates to 9.0 for an additional year. M. Luciano I get what you're saying, but it also launches on the latest update. So using the Pixel, it launches with N, will get O after a year, will get P after a year and then is not guaranteed to get Q. Are we really going to get a Q? So during each of those three updates, N, O and P, it on the latest OS and getting monthly security updates. 2 years of updates, so long as it includes the 2nd major OS update, translates to three full years. Ever since they started the annual number and letter update, we're essentially talking about a single API version update per year (2016 had 2, including the one you're referencing which impacted Shamu). Sir_Brizz I've already pointed this out twice: look at the Nexus 6 for a first hand example of how this is going to work. The Nexus 6 will not be on the latest version of Android for three years because it is already not on the latest version of Android despite getting monthly security updates. 03grunt Thanks for clarifying! Chris Kiederer As a Nexus 5X/project Fi user, right now the Pixel is my only choice if my Nexus decides to blow up like many before it. I really hope this Android one rumor heading to the US is true, as it would give project Fi subscribers more than just a really expensive option to stay on the plan Andye82 But exactly one year from today it will be still extremely difficult if not impossible to get your hands on pixel 2 Mix "Persistent stock issues have plagued Google's first "in-house" handset from day one..." I am on my 3rd phone and I still wonder, every time I use it, if it will be like my last two phones. I have phone PTSD! Google should just pull a Nintendo and just stop producing and move on to the 2 but not fuck it up. John Doe Great job on the article, now I will be waiting for the editorial on Google's software update policy LoL PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Google's inexperience producing a smartphone They had great experience running Motorola. Ammar "Sure, Google got some things astoundingly right: the performance, the camera, the larger software experience" To be honest, these are the only reasons why I'd ever get a Pixel over any other Android phone. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ I agree with some of Radar's points as well as teh main one as I've *never* recommended the XL because I know that the vast majority of people are sheep-like followers and/or technophobes, and I defifnitely don't want part of the onus for a technophobe's major purchase that they're going to rue the second that an iPhoner mocks them. The Pixel sells itself to PowerUsers on its own merit, which, AEB the popularity of inferior and/or questionable top-sellers, clearly supports my previous assertions. JPLoureiro Deciphering of your sentences will commence............. now. Futbolrunner What? Marty I never was going to buy an HTC Pixel. Don't like HTC and the build quality doesn't deserve such a high price. jawsnnn My SOs Pixel is probably the buggiest Google phone I have used till date. The Google Assistant, voice search are consistently broken and the phone doesn't offer much else in way of justifying it's price. Will definitely buy an OEM phone next. Google's hardware experiment is dead for me. Tim Harman I wish I'd read this 2 weeks ago! Oh well. I've got a Pixel now and I do love it. I live in NZ and the version I ended up with is the American one, which means that while it supports all my LTE bands, it doesn't support Carrier Aggregation on the bands used here. So that's my excuse for why I simply MUST HAVE the P2 when it's released. Damian Stuart Wow, what a load of crap! The Pixel is a superb phone with issues affecting small numbers of devices. I have one, after moving away from the Samsung range. I have had no issues and as I don't ever intend to take a phone swimming haven't got a single complaint about it. But haters gonna hate. sebastianer @David Ruddock Don't forget the terrible compass. If you grab an iPhone 5S and a Pixel. Open Google Maps in both of them. An you start walking trough dense downtowns the whole day (closing / opening maps at different places). You will see that the Pixel compass accuracy is constantly changing every time you open maps and is a total mess while the 5S is perfectly accurate after 1-2 seconds and less than one step. I hope the next Pixel has a completely new sensor...or compass or whatever. Last 3-4 Google Phones were a mess. I think the last Google phone with more or less good compass was the galaxy nexus but I can't even remember now TechGuy22 i'm selling mine soon since i know i can sell it around 600 dollars and it's the 128GB wjrandon So glad I kept my Nexus 6P for a second year... and look at those rock solid resale values. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9d5926ba5094521287d1d54e2476d3852462178bdf74a16166f94742b435213c.jpg TechGuy22 i sold mine for 500 dollars and i bought it used too lol that's how i managed to get the XL 128GB eric messenger It depends on what phone your coming from. For most android users it is a great phone with a great camera. If your coming from an iPhone the pixel is the first great alternative to an iphone. The on device support is actually awesome and they are very quick with support issues. I am used to Nexus devices plagued with serious issues that you had to work around and while they were great phones for the price I felt they all suffered (maybe not the 6P). Anyway the point is pixel raised the bar for Android and brought it up to par with Apple. It's probably still worth buying if you have to upgrade, and you can just get the pixel 3 in 2019 or 2020. Sean You can say this about any phone at the moment....wait for next gen. As a Project Fi user I am waiting on a phone that has the cell radio to take advantage of T-mobile's new 600mhz band they are quickly rolling out...and NO, it cant be done with a software update on any phone. me me "quickly rolling out"? The spectrum is sold but not available yet as the current user vacates.... Sean NOT TRUE....they are rolling it out in areas NOW where the old TV stations have already vacated the band. Google is your friend. me me finally, you realize it was crap, was always, still now, only thing now is you changed. Never worth the money, specs so-so for the price. Islam Google Pixel poor use of space. over-priced. BS Sean People that actually OWN one dont agree........ TechGuy22 i agree and i have one. sadly, it just stopped caring about the bezel since there's nothing i can do to make it look better VAVAMk_2 6P user here with a new battery happily waiting it out for Pixel 2. Sean Boot loop much? Ernie I have had my Nexus 6p since day one of the release. I have been lucky not to have encountered the boot loop or battery problems others have reported. I love my Nexus 6p. Hope it will get Android O. Phone_Addiction Pixel 2 probably going be the same story. Google will never learn. Dean F Marsh I love my Pixel XL! Invest in a good quality case and enjoy the phone. It's really pretty decent and for a few minor quirks mentioned, and none that I have experience yet, I can't be happier. From Nexus, HTC, Samsung, to Pixel XL, this has been the best so far. Ailín Ó’S I live in Ireland and Pixel isn't even available here yet which is odd given we were a launch country for Nexus 5x/6p but hey ho. Rick Schoonmaker This is just what I like to read after getting banged by Google and Huawei with the 6P bootloop issue 1 year and 2 days (read 2 days out of warranty) after buying and being told that my only option is to buy a new phone. So after being without a phone for a week, I had to buy a Pixel XL even though I really didn't want it and especially at the ridiculous price ($860 for 32Gb.. are you effing kidding?). Matt Definitely. I got a pixel XL the very first morning when it was available in local store. Great phone, camera, software. 2 months later, the phone began to behave crazily--extra hot, microphone malfunction. Called Google support for like 10 times and had it replaced, then I put the brand new replacement on local trade platform without hesitation. Google-brand is attatractive, but does not worth that rediculous amount of money. I can get a even better performed oneplus counterpart for almost half price. Anyway, I am on my moto x 2014 with lineage os 14 and i am pretty happy. It is sufficient for me to deal with my daily work. And I also suggest to wait for the release of more flagships from variant companies to have more flexible and reasonable options. Spinkick Google seems to not be able to follow through on anything these days. It just seems like if its not sexy or cool and needs actual work, they cant be bothered. Maybe they will release another chat app in the meantime.. 2 Men-E I want the Pixel 2 XXL (Taimen). It better exist as a 5.6"+ screened device. Philip Although if you're with TMobile. It's significantly cheaper to buy the Pixel, and get your money's worth. Granted the Pixel is guaranteed two years of support, it matches with TMobile promotion pay credit time. h4rr4r They offer a discount? I thought it was just financing. Philip Yep. $325 in TMobile bill credits over two years. Which is when the Pixel 3 will be out. So you buy a Pixel, get refunded about half of the cost. And then you're ready to upgrade to the third generation. belac77 shhh, David, I just listed my Pixel for sale on Swappa! ;) Mason Andrew Maseda This entire article is just terrible and written by someone just mad they don't have one. M. Luciano lol he got one the week after I did. He's had one. Adrianus Bratanata Supply and demand. As long as there is bigger demand than supply they don't need to reduce the price drunken_bastard I disagree. All the pros you mentioned for the Pixel -- pure Android experience, performence, camera, etc -- those are all the reasons why the Pixel and Pixel XL is still the best smartphone on the market. Worried a new one is going to come out? Happens with every flagship, every year. This one doesn't have the lastest SoC? I challenge you to demonstrate real world differences in actual speed versus the Galaxy S8, which is a gorgeous handset that yet again is crippled by bloated software and long standing issues that never seem to get addressed. You cite support potentially ending in October 2018 for software updates, but that's still a longer window than any other Android flagship, and you get them day one, which Samsung and LG don't. A smartphone is more than the sum of it's parts. It's an experience. I feel on that quality alone, the Pixel and Pixel XL are the best representations to date. NeMoDoSeZ I was going to buy a 128gb Pixel XL but due to not being available I ended up waiting and purchasing a Galaxy S8+. I'm now glad things ended up the way they did because I'm loving my S8+. Rod Until Android 8 is released. Then you'll like: fuck Samsung man! My U$xxx phone is outdated, goddamnit! Owen Iverson I hate the world of tech. We've now gotten used to NEEDING the latest thing IMMEDIATELY. Its why companies like Microsoft, Adobe, and Autodesk have switched to monthly/yearly subscriptions so you have to pay for the rest of your life. "The Bluetooth performance is horrid." What metric, speed? Connectivity? "It's not waterproof." Not sure that waterproof is a common trait among all high-end phones just yet. "The bezels really are due for a shrink." I've never used a bezel-less phone, where do you pick it up or hold it? Does your finger trigger anything on the edges? "The Snapdragon 821 is officially old news." What are you running where 1) you see lag and 2) that it's an actual problem. Maybe people are replacing consoles with their phones just like they're replacing their DSLRs with their phones? "it doesn't support proper advanced network features across all four of the big US carriers." What are these advanced network features? Anyway, I know it's a phone blog, so ... D13H4RD2L1V3 Well, he means that since its successor isn't far off, and that the Pixel is still not easy to get hold of, you might be better off waiting, since the Pixel is also selling at full price still. Edward jh How can the camera be great I mean what about the pixel camera lens flare issue plaguing 1000's of users. Margaritas Ante Porcos Pixel was a disaster. The worst phone for that price. I understand some of you got the Stockholm syndrome. But some of us see the clear picture. Google simply lost this round with both hands down. Dan Yurman My Google Pixel seems to have a mind of its owns. Here's what it does without my asking it - 1. shuts down randomly and has to be restarted by holding the power button and lower end of the volume rocker for about 15 seconds; 2. randomly starts different pieces of software including a suspiciously high frequency of instances of Google Play Music, which I have since disable, 3. Starts the flashlight from the pull down menu if the phone is placed face down on a shiny flat surface, 4 And randomly starts other programs after unlocking the phone with a pin. On the plus side the camera does good work and the phone is easily held in one hand and scrolled with fingers from the same hand while eating hit wings with the other. :-) Ray I'm very glad I read this article. I was on the fence - and almost pulled the trigger the other day but very glad I didn't now. I'll wait for the next gen and hopefully it's a much better piece of kit - and possibly cheaper. lomsha Whaaaat, you don't say. rockon999 My 2015 Moto X PE's display stopped functioning properly and I needed a new device to *function* in my daily life. So I bought a pixel, yesterday. To address your complaints... I never use Bluetooth on a phone, I'm getting a case, I'll hate the speakers (but I really only use headphones), I'm no bezel snob, and finally... waterproofing? My Moto X PE was waterproofed and I can honestly say it never aided me in one single way. Sure, it felt great using the phone in the rain that one time. But I'm fairly certain an encased pixel can survive that. I know it is probably a horrible value, but I really don't want to deal with buying a $200 phone now, selling it later for $100, and then buying a new $900 phone in a few months. I don't have time to constantly be reselling and selling my devices and I don't have a spare $100 to just throw around on a device. Slurms Mckenzie Seriously have been saying most of what this article is about since day one. I have a pixel XL and I've hated it since receiving it. It's not worth what Google asks when everything that is offered can be had for half the money (quick updates not included) for that asking price it should at least offer sd card support which is something even the most basic phones have. I've been using Nexus phones since the beginning (skipped the 6) and the problems with them were expected as it was a budget friendly phone but if you want to charge premium pricing don't use cloth for your ear piece cover, have dual speakers, and for God's sake don't make deals with the devil (Verizon) to lock down MIMO as a carrier specific feature when every damn phone is capable of and and most carriers are as well F*** you Pixel XL you sack of shit what a waste of 800 bucks Rod Best camera Google photos unlimited backup at original resolution Best performance Lowest touch latency of all Android phones "Just" that. micahthomas Basically all you're saying is wait if a new version is going to be released in 6 months. Might as well just say that, doesn't really have anything to do with if it's iPhone or Android. JG I was about to order my mother a 32GB Pixel a week or so ago to replace her Nexus 5X. I recently discovered the glass of its camera lens has a pretty decent crack in it. It doesn't seem to affect pictures - yet... But we're planning a fairly photogenic trip this summer and I figured the Pixel has a better camera and has unlimited free full resolution Google Photos uploads so... But as I was about to click the "Add to Cart" button, I thought we're not all that far from the expected October release of the Pixel 2. I'm sure mom wouldn't mind being a generation behind, but... derk p just replace the housing on hers. i bought a white one but then wanted a blue back... was cheap on ebay and is very easy to snap on and snap off dizel123 Relatively speaking we're not too far from October of next year for the Pixel 3. Or October 2019 for the Pixel 4... toast I never buy Apple, and I never buy Samsung. But both of their hardware just feel slicker than the Pixel. As the article says, knock a few hundred off the price, and I'd be a keen buyer, mainly for the camera and fast OS updates, and Google "Purity". I'll wait and see how the upcoming Moto Z and X phones turn out. Defenestratus It'll be difficult for me to go back to a Google phone after the nightmare that was my 6P. Major Sceptic Availability is no problem in my neck of the woods , and I appreciate the work Google did on the camera as a point and shoot and smooth software , but after looking at the pixels they looked a bit underwhelming in the feature department , and then as mentioned the outrageous​ prices for the pixels I wouldn't go near one . I might add with the smooth software , Google no longer has the Monopoly on as most devices with 7.0 onwards are very good . Rod What feature does it miss? redsoxwin I'm not sure what this person's agenda is, but this is great phone. Strange article. Amie Perry Porter I personally love my Pixel phone. Will Dutton I never cease to be amazed that everyone always thinks that 'the next one will fix it' with android John Quincy Adams Whining about bezels is ignorance. Without bezels, how do you hold it? . ..please, bezel whiners...answer this... gar216 I'm a happy Nexus 6p user. Even prior to launch I couldn't justify upgrading my 7 month old 6p to a Pixel XL. It would have clearly been an upgrade, but I didn't think it was enough of an upgrade for the price. Also... It's kinda ugly. SiliconAddic "The Google Pixel is a notoriously hard phone to get a hold of. Persistent stock issues have plagued Google's first "in-house" handset from day one, and things really are little to no better in the six months since the launch event. " Um BS. Google has ALWAYS his issues with distribution. The Nexus 5 had this issue, the Nexus 6 had this problem, the 6p also had this problem and now the pixel. Google is incompetent when it comes to this. Meanwhile Apple can launch a new phone and you can walk into any of their stores and pick one up. I wanted a Pixel to replace my Nexus 6, could not get one. I ended up with a S7 edge. Google and Nintendo should team up with their inability to ship jack ****. Eric How does this stand to affect the resale value / trade-in value for current pixel owners under project fi? I'm asking as someone who switched to project fi from Verizon prepaid in early January, and has almost been regretting it ever since. I am a quadriplegic in a power wheelchair to whom the pixel with Google Assistant seemed a natural front runner, due to its voice capabilities, and project fi with it's much touted multi Network and Wi-Fi hopping capabilities seemed a good decision as well. Did my due dilligence and the 4G network to all appearances covered me completely, even though I live with my elderly parents in a rural area. The only option available for order at the time was a white Pixel (not XL) and 32gb. I was nervous about the 32 part at the time, but felt comfortable with the infinite backup capability of Google photos. Now, 3 1/2 months later, not only is service spotty, audio crackly despite not being a candidate for replacement under the microphone bug, and Google's customer service... Let us politely say not the most helpful on the issue. I apologize about the length of this comment, (and after reading over it I really should have made it a direct message) but the difference between a phone worth $600 and the phone worth $300 in retail/tradein is quite a big deal to someone like me, and as much as I love my pixel (and admire/fear/respect Google) getting out while the getting is good is starting to sound the smarter move. ( especially after the 180 they made on the 5x.... Grrrrr) Was curious to get an educated opinion on the subject. Thanks again for your ( and anyone else's who has read this far) time and any insight offered! dizel123 Opinion: Even if you can, you probably shouldn't read David Ruddock's articles anymore. Adam Myself having been using the Pixel since day one, I would agree to an extent... Would I go out a purchase a brand new Pixel/Pixel XL for full retail? Of course not! Only because the new iteration is just around the corner. Now, would I go buy a Galaxy S8 or an iPhone 7? No way, wouldn't even consider it! I have switched phones at least every 6 months for the past 3 to 4 years, between Android and iOS operating systems as well... Having said that, the Pixel has been the best phone and best experience that I have had to date! This is the first time that I haven't thought about what phone I want to get next, and to be honest there would have to be significant improvements for me to even get the newest iteration when it comes out this fall. This phone as just been that good. To sum things up... I would not buy the Pixel/Pixel XL right now at full retail cost, I definitely would NOT go out and buy a Galaxy S8 or an iPhone either... If you, like myself, really love the Pixel line and want to get one and don't already own one. I would suggest trying to hold out and get the newest release this fall. It's most definitely worth the wait! D13H4RD2L1V3 Google always seems to have issues with stocking ever since the Nexus days. Pretty embarrassing that it's still hard to get a hold of one after 6 months. Probably due for a small price cut soon, as newer phones roll out. me me yeah I loved Nexus back with Nexus 4, 5, 7. Now the Nexus banner is carried by the likes of Moto G, OnePlus.... H2OSKI So true. The bluetooth issues alone nearly make this phone unusable. Drops and cutout's every 20 seconds. Get this, my Pixel was fine UNTIL Google sent out "the server side" update to fix the Bluetooth issues my phone never had!!! Thanks Google. Mine is going back this week. Great camera crap bluetooth. I take pics occasionally​ but I need to use a bluetooth headset hours a day. Multiple headphones, headsets, and vehicle connections with all the same result...even in safe mode. Fail. Daishi Google shot themselves in the foot when they gussied up an HTC 10 and called it a Pixel. It is just any other Android phone and doesn't have the support behind it to justify the price. Six months along, it should be more than 50% off. William Ross Why the hell is this idiot comparing a 6 month old device to the newer releases? A year in smartphone years is a lifetime. That being said, the pixel still has the best most up to date software bar none! The camera is still among the best if not the best. And, although the 835 is a newer processor, the 821 is no slouch. GTFOH with this garbage article. And, I'll definitely be getting the next Pixel regardless of price. And, I'll sell my original on eBay for a pretty penny. And, this baby has no scratches any where. It's always been in a case and all glass has been protected by Liquid Armor. diggie Pixel is a $650+ phone built like a budget chinese phone. And sorry, Oneplus has Google beat on OS features while keeping "stock" feel. William Ross Oh here we go again with the one plus fans always hating on the pixel. If your phone is so great then why knock the pixel? I just don't get it. Just talk about how great your actual Chinese knockoff is. No need to hate in the Pixel. The one plus has little more than a cult following and mock my words, it'll never be a mainstream device. me me Android Police and a lot of its customers are hating the Pixel. The OnePlus fans just chime in. I own a OP3T. It simply works, yep even Bluetooth. When take tax into account, its about half the price. OnePlus fans biggest concern: price creep upwards. $300 becomes $350 becomes $390 becomes.... Goblin Shark Is this article from April 1st? Absolutely no one with any knowledge of phone tech recommended a Pixel, ever! Underspeced and overpriced, I doubt there's any trouble keeping them in stock they just know nobody wants them so they're not making any. Rod Under-spec'ed? Ok Underperforming? Nope Edgar Morales I honestly don't see what the problem is I purchased my pixel XL and have not to date had any issues whatsoever with it no Bluetooth issues no speaker issues nothing everyone is saying Michael Hannigan Hey, if you get a phone you love and it lasts just under a year, that's good enough. What more do you expect for a few hundred bucks. Appreciate the year you loved that thing and then replace it with a new one that you can love even more. Tom Takumi Okamoto OnePlus is a better phone maker than Google. A company not even 1% worth of Google. I really want a Pixel but it's not practical. Ionut Lala I'm sorry but that is clearly not a first generation device. Not the first from Google (made by HTC and let's not forget about the Nexus line). And not the first from HTC (for obvious reasons). Aquan Belk I wish other Android manufacturers went to stock Android. I know Samsung shines in it's own apps on top of Android but vanilla Android still is and always will be the best. Rod You heard the man, people. Don't buy a Pixel because it will have bad resale value and won't be updated for long. Instead, get a model that will have bad resale value and won't be updated for long, plus has worst performance, buggy software and worse camera performance. You're welcome. Stephonz My last Google phone was Nexus 5. As much as I like pure Android experience, Google has a bigheaded trend in phones. The price point was my biggest no no after the 5X. They don't offer as much features as the other well known Android companies.. amir80 I have a Pixel 32 gb and I really really like it. Everything works great and the camera is amazing and also the battey life. For me, the fingerprint sensor is a must. The S8 sensor is poorly located and the G6 sensor is too small. GeorgeDao123 Absolutely. The Pixel duo are 2 pieces of $#!¶. They run pure Android version and they are so slow to boot up and open apps though they are lag-free. Neru Nexus I've had a pixel since launch day. For one I don't agree with the bluetooth issues. Keep the phone up to date or use the bluetooth connect and play app to automate things. Second it is a over priced phone but so is an iPhone. The main reason real users should get a pixel is the updates. Sure you might need to learn something about that expensive piece of tech you bought and not just sit on your hands waiting for the apples or googles of the world to update your shit, but at least google gave us source code, kernel code and a unlocked bootloader. There are still updates being made for the old nexus 5, that's like 5 years old. Grab iphone 4s and tell me again about how fucking great those updates are lol. You can't even install apps like skype or whatsapp that thing is pooched. I can promise the world that even if google stops updating the pixel in 2018 there will be updated versions of the os you can manually install for years. Let's see if you can get more then one firmware update on your fancy new samsung s8. My money is on 1, then the s9 will launch a year later and samsung just won't care about the s8. rjcuk What if you want a slightly smaller phone? The S8 is 5.8" compared to the Pixel at 5". I really struggle to hold 6" phones. Even the Nexus 5X at 5.2" was too big to grip properly and comfortably. Janoo Ramachandran DON'T BUY A PIXEL. We have 2 Pixels at home. One bought early November 16 and the other end Jan 17. The one I was gifted this January, within 40 days had microphone related issues. I could not hear anyone on the phone, nor was the music being played out. They refused a replacement. My phone sat in the repair centre for 8 plus day and the mother board replaced. Have you ever heard of a new phone device of any other brand needing a mother board replacement in leads than 45 days WELL GOOGLE PHONE PIXEL NEEDED IT. The other phone bought early November 16 started having other issues last month and it wasn't recognizing the wifi. After at least 20 hours on the phone with the terrible google support, it had to be sent to the repair centre where it was kept for 2 weeks, you heard that right 16 days to be precise. Then the phone came back with a chip replaced. SHOULD YOI BUY A PIXEL EVER. :. NEVER SHOULD YOU LOOK AT GOOGLE AS A PHONE MAKER :. NEVER Nikhil I wholeheartedly concur here. I picked up a Pixel sometime around December which had to be promptly returned for a replacement as the volume rocker was rickety. The replacement didn't last long either. Within a month, the widely acknowledged microphone issues popped up and after almost 15 days of talking to the very incompetent Google support in India, their only resolution was to take the Pixel to the service center. The service center did not have the motherboard in stock (they had to bring it all the way from Taiwan) and my phone still languishes there even after 15 days of me submitting it. The phone suffers from not only just Gen-one product issues, but also terrible after sales support. Leonardo Baez Agree.... ait for the next generation THEN buy current generation cheaper. Jeremy Allan Actual customer service? You do realize that owners of a pixel get free 24/7 support any time, on a dedicated line for pixel owners? Exalm There is the same section in the settings on Nexus 5X and 6P. No idea whether it works, since there's no chat or phone support in Russia neither for Nexus nor Pixel. Cory Wilson I agree. Granted it was around a year ago I bought my 6p but the 6p didn't cost $870 either. Still don't regret that decision Impulse_Vigil Haven't really had any serious Pixel Bluetooth issues here... A handful of times (literally less than half a dozen) BT shut itself off back in Feb-March, hasn't happened again since the Play Services patch. I use Bluetooth on a daily 24/7 basis too with my ZenWatch 3, car audio, etc. I don't push it to its range limits tho. Dunno whether David's usage and issue is some sorta edge case, or range related, or whether he was speaking to the 1-2 month period when others were having more severe Bluetooth shut off issues. I do agree with the overall sentiment tho, Google hasn't made it easy to buy the Pixel and that's simply inexcusable. I haven't had to suffer thru any of the QC issues (no BT, mic, whatever issues here, knock on wood) but it seems they weren't handled super well either. To be honest I wouldn't even recommend the S8 to anyone either unless it's another geek/enthusiast, these days for most people it's simply not worth it to spend that kind dosh on a phone. I bought my mother a Moto Z Play; I'd probably point others towards that, the OP3, or an HTC One/S7 on sale. I'm super happy with my Pixel, but if there was a OnePlus 3-class device for Zoglog Having owned a pixel XL and now a s8+, I'd have to agree. Even not taking into account the questionable hardware reliability of the pixel (mine died in 5 months). Basically when I owned the pixel I loved the hell out of stock Android but I kept on wondering why I paid so much for it. Meanwhile with the S8+ the gorgeous screen makes it feel especially special and worth the price. Even though I would prefer stock Android 10000% sebastianer Pixel is just another Nexus. Like the 6P. There is no excuse, this is not their first premium phone. Still made by HTC instead of Huawei. And called Pixel instead of Nexus...and more expensive because of HTC and all the marketing costs. And..still has the shitty compass all their recent previous nexus had with a lot of topics open in Google product forums and staff giving tons of manuals about how to perfect calibrate something that doesn't retain calibration. But the main reason I wouldn't buy a Pixel...is the compass and secondly that you will get one more android update if you wait 6 months. username_not_valid How is the pixel the first 'in-house Google phone'? Its clearly and actually a slightly rehashed HTC. HTC doesn't just make it ,they designed it for all intents and purposes. Unless Googles design strategy happens to be exactly like HTCs then its not a Google phone. The Pixel is just an over priced nexus, nothing else. SOUL- Always great to see the smartphone community go from praising a phone to outright basing it just after a couple of months. Perfectly fine with my Pixel.

We also spent a lot of time on the process of trying to reinsert a tooth, thanks to I-T and the Celtics training staff. You Might Like Transcript - Not for consumer use. Robot overlords only. Will not be accurate. Isiah Thomas could officially now play for the Boston bruins'. Man that you took knocked out hit a shot. It took Jim back in. Whatever they do I don't know what they do for stuff like that off something and insufficient because it came back out of it and I without expected to cool earth thinks you use your ticket let him back and there are. Took without a doubt there's now acknowledges a budget that Israel had a right garlic it they what they say they reposition reasserted it re inserted into the truth out. How I heard it back on some super glue and there is how old are from of that play all the hold this boat the blood pressure did it just. It too. I can see somebody snapped their leg and I don't get as we are now as to who they bugged big bucks yet. Its growth and edit that out and then. You imagine playing of that too you're sticking your tong and between the gap now you'd be fixated. And then. And you're thinking like damn there goes that to art institute that is the pick up and around Greta retrieved it hold this prayer with an penniless starter out in jail and all that to do you begin to jailed on all all this toothy girl came Shana dale is going to do yet what about going to game. C'mon Paul and that's not sticking north that is to do anything else to do an ideology ballistic a couple of milk or hot. Dip ice that. That once they put a packet he played that for a little bit and don't happen and was out there in the post game retirement or spurt. To. And he didn't he want to look up on the interview so he called act got all of that out before you talk to be the same. I'm a dentist that suits like this I'd say department when it does give policy. This can get a files of people falls to earth are you know get them at Reynolds and coal hole roll hall with I don't know holes out of all these that's OK but they're not wells you know like yours. It's their truth you you own your own where it might cost pocket artful tees off on the radio can we. Hats right now and that it didn't end up up up. Editor anything else anything else that it you have you paid for now part of your I don't care that we. On matters here around as well okay guy. OK OK okay. Actually it was my blog ball these as a they're Mario very well artists there and you're urged. Google I had you embrace them as it tells loses a tooth that to a six Michael says I get thick rest rest rest that you're there now make it out and out. I don't he would leave I don't know acquired back today that accurately or just I'm working out there's trying to figure out polls this pale kind Google's now now they. Now they're mr. reform it technologies you don't hear about it and you don't hear it now. It's like to acquitted of all do that aren't maybe that maybe I don't fault too many was up when that was knocked out to wonder. If it went out and dialed it back in. Who's thinking just put a real to back it but it it's a false tooth maybe you already got some sort of and you didn't do it but the Bruce is a better yeah right. At that brings us yeah act brings that element a top I think I'm details right at does this is like a little like you know the Bruins are not playing any more or less the spirit of the brew while I design that was great tactic. And finally an act like it really bothered him much. No not at all. It's more vodka cosmetic thing. It's it's it's still it's your 20 I bet not off the phones at sort of vanity thing. You know you don't think about during the game and after the end of my tooth and smiled at close. SE techsters hardy saying it was a cap you know put realty backhand. Out I guess I'm I don't know. We can't get open for him. It. Yeah I have no judgment whatsoever. I wanna do your caps when I have dentures whatever you want whenever you meet go let it go for it. I just if you scored 33 points and helped fuel come back you do what you wanna do man they give a bit of a cushion and that. They did you know we're so lucky to be in the game in the game in the first quarter be in the game at halftime. Washington. I had some. The brilliant offensive numbers in the first half. And still you're down five after. Giving up the first sixteen points of the game you're lucky Ali is lucky to be down five to be in the game I have spoken about the Celtics at halftime. Okay they withstand that type of blitz. But by the wizards in the back the Celtics were ready to play at all. And if you come on the third quarter and you're only down five at home about the when I really thought there when we get mad and I didn't foresee them going on around like it did yeah but that they when it. It's one of the weirdest games one of the weirdest sport games in any sport I've ever seen when you you start out given up the first sixteen points you're down twenty to three. So you down seventeen points at one point in Europe fifteen and another point. It's like. The wizards just that Oscar with. When act when this thing is it was strange and they won or is like four minutes or five minutes without a point rebound. Or obviously an assist like how it comes yeah did not have one of those things. And it just didn't happen and how are you not down by forty if nobody has any of those things and the guys that as delegates on the line. And I think that's sort of calm things down for the whole team Eaton he knocks down three free throws are sent aka. It a year ago and then from there on out socially you know segment were on. They couldn't mess for Calgary a sort of last recount Jae Crowder when he's missing it just doesn't look right into. LA and what is vacated you're like how veco and right that's that that's not a good shot oh there it is sixth at eight from three for Crowder who seemed to be open. All the time why I think there's going to be a lot of open shots. For the Celtics in this series and we're just talking about it. On during the period and during the cross over during the break they're trying to think of a lockdown defender for the Washington Wizards and it's hard to come up with. That guy you know have a very athletic guy. May be the most that may be the best athlete in the series and job law. Just incredibly speed size. It's fantastic I can seat at John Wall he wanted cute he wanted to be on the US track team. For the Olympics he could do it he's one of fastest guys in the NBA with the ball on the stand. Just an incredible talent but not necessarily a he lock down defender either is Bradley deal. Neither its border neither neither is mores when he's out there. Courts I guess at times. So nobody's gonna stop you perimeter guys showed defensively the Celtics if you just wanna go individual defenders in guys that you trust and guys who can who can really. I'm make it difficult for you disrupt your offense the Celtics have those guys the wizards don't. As a means Celtics gonna and his wife through the series run for the series but that's something that's going to be their form the entire time open shots. I once won a free 111 those are the type the scores the seers you would expect I don't I don't expect the Celtics the code nineteen of 39 from three every game ever. Maybe our dad I mean that is it's a bunch of threes but also raise it is insanely high percentage. It just about everybody how to go on Bradley at the real slow start used on a few guys that. What everybody at first but then once they got going even he took hold a longer. That knocked out the shots but. They were hit everything in ice on the pollsters that's it was a it was a case. I tell you guys have no more questions. No more questions whatsoever about Isiah Thomas Dunne. Ever at at avenue that Max contract guy we have that there's no idea I know it. Question of what's so I don't camera eye to the ideal by any might be history and but is there is any issue about Isiah Thomas commenced a post season and you really had to. You know Dick for this one you know we look at this platforms against Cleveland. And it's first you know play opera with the Celtics in the mucus playoff performance gives. Atlanta is he a playoff performer about stigma that is right there it is well percentage you'll love it and I think you have to dig and say why is that why is that happening. You can you can take the easy answer the easy answer is well does play up numbers are down that means. You know he the post season is too big form or just doesn't perform well enough to post season or you could say. Teams. Got a better effort from their Tina Barrett strong defense yeah came out and said we're gonna take my of the series and it really could I get a really good job on the put. You look at what he did against the bulls. Following the worst news of his of his young life so far the worst news. And and then coming back at 4 o'clock in the morning. I asked god speaking at his sister making editors and giving eulogize and his sister. Coming back. To Boston 4 o'clock in morning gets to the arena at 10 o'clock in the morning. At 1 o'clock tilt has that start. Has decade I have so this whole world the way he has played. Throughout the regular season in the post season no question about it as it comes. You guys like. The plus minus that basketball and unlike plus minus that hockey. I know I know but that we're talking basketball right now Michael and try to keep throughout Iraq are down like it or not yeah I'm not not laden and all that much about the guy if it helps my argument yes I have the reason I ask is Jake router goes out there. It's six of eight from three scores 24 points. And it's plus 26. Al corporate 21 points nine rebounds and assists is plus one wanna. Now is that gonna Bator know what you're saying well like Isiah Thomas was like even. With 33 points so it's it's really good and you asked me if I liked the stance and no debt. I liked it until I heard guys they apart yet I have no I don't I don't I don't I don't know this at all that much I always wonder you know which stats how to how to stats become involved. It in hockey the plus minus that is is looked at differently you know some people like it some people don't. And I wondered him because I have only heard of the plus minus that basketball the last what 567 years yeah. And I wondered debt does anybody to look at it doesn't matter yeah somehow I think so yes. Sometimes sometimes people do the question I'm looking at that this is what I'm looking at right now who wisest thing where the Celtics right now. Who are they are they. Are they no doubt Eastern Conference finalist. Are they. That the superior team in this series or did you just get off to a good start against the Washington raisers. I think there are better team I'd I personal think it's a no doubt going to the conference finals type thing I think they are. It's cool simplistic but there are a bit of day. Live by the three die by the three get type team because if they're not shooting like that they probably don't come back in and win in part that's Washington again there's a lot of wide open looks and they are hitting number we've also seen games. Where they could probably anything yet crowd Ehrlich Smart he's got to get wide open threes and missing album so. I think this is the kind of team we know that they're capable of and I think that you know their two best players. Also eyed monster game Thomas and Horford other two best players and they both played tremendous to me they probably are a better team in Washington. Two guys ahead questions about a week and a half ago and and and word topic of conversation week and a half ago. You have to give credit you wanna miss Al Horford yup Al Horford has played great. Since game three of the bowl series. So games games three through six he was great he was great yesterday morning as they said the war and and game those game two of the game big game to exactly and Robin Lopez going opera knows first hand them and hold him somewhat responsible for those. So Al Horford. And the Coach Brad Stevens yeah Bret Stephens. Are making the adjustment going to Gerald Green I don't Rondo was out of that game in the you know he always asked the question and what would have happened of Rondo. Had been there I don't know but I think there's there would have been on line obtained Jo green and and Amir Johnson now. And then yesterday. Going would Gerald Green it's not working second half he goes to market Smart take Joseph Greene out of it. It just seems that now he's it's just yesterday with his seventeenth playoff game IMAP is our right in net to shake you got to an utterly. But oh heard that. Latitude to it's and it's a 20%. Hey guys I know isn't money. Mo Claiborne are so but I think if yes it was a seventeen playoff game and it seems easy. Goes through the playoff. Games he's getting warm more comfortable with just the match of the mixing and matching. I wanna give you credit for I'm surprised you or two we know about what's that. I thought after the bulls series symbol of Jill brown can't play in this series and Amir Johnson why would they play against Washington. And you set out and only things happened and this wasn't their series and maybe they get called upon. And your credit Eagles the ball those guys hopefully never Amir Johnson and that's useless if this afternoon and now out of what he does well. I don't know again we don't know was never I mean he's he's got. Well it's got that our guys the that you better make a small but Jalen brown. You could tell he wasn't the first shot Oscar and it is indeed did you see in like OK this guy he's he's ready for it and they didn't wanna bottle it was going to be another DCD. Bought Gerald green was useless in this game. Mark is Smart had a stretch there where. What was he doing here like three or immediately either turn or foul on every trip Brett and that is like argued dot. And the terror rosier severe line up of Thomas Bradley and rosy year at one point but you can't really get smaller than that. And then rose series and artwork overview and let's bring in Jalen brown fourth quarter of a second round playoff game. Had barely played the last series they Brigham and knocks on a couple of shots gets a couple of rebounds it was pretty active and so. You know what I wouldn't be shocked if he started game two that it Gerald Green experiment it was nice it was a nice little boost that they needed but I think that's done. I don't know I don't know who's down are I think having Gerald green is still in play I don't know if he's in play as a starter. But he's got a he's gonna get some minutes but he just is it's really strange in the playoffs. Series to series. Which guy steps up in and finds his moment in other court guys are always going to be the same Isiah Thomas dollar's gonna play yet Al Horford Bradley those guys going to be an against anybody. But you know against a against Chicago was Joseph Greene against Washington knows it might be Tyler Zeller. Well plots and allowed then I. I guess Dugard never at all I Interpol is that who that guy is gonna step up and and find his little need each. It in the next five or six games. But I do think this is a I think this is looking like a five to six game series and it's a six. There's I really wanna say fiber of medical conservative today it's Monday so to be conservative Monday Imus his Celtics win in six conservative Monday conservative Monday. So. That right I nation wrong times if it. Yes that's right it's not a bad idea Karzai and how conservative heritage and I everybody brining it. Every day all day everyday at one of those home team wins every game tape series so easily W seven yeah and I think they're pretty. Evenly matched their little bit different. Third different balls as they are slightly different their different evenly matched one all that mattered most though. If marquee Morse comply. He says he's gonna play but Rajon Rondo said he was gonna play too that's a good point yeah without hammy maybe it doesn't go seven again is Michael that not that he's their best player. But based often what they what they do the line ups they're gonna have to throughout their go up against the Celtics. You think there'd be a lot more. Marquee Mora so yep I mean I guess that's sort of he said as ankle swelled up to the thousand with a softball race at. I can't be and that is you know you got a quick turnaround yet a quick turn around how to on Friday night for both of these teams. Planks they had won and and I do agree with was gallon in my Gorman we're talking about this you're saying. This makes no sense none to Cleveland and Toronto Boca. If and a four weeks spoke directly of about deferral of show it's. I can see use it okay but we still want Cleveland for Monday night. I yes. And and we want we want this Celtics and wizards on Sunday. At 1 o'clock o'clock start as an ally and they're all playing on Friday night. Got engaged so all you Alex that you place at one end of flip around. You have a quick when he had the end game tomorrow night so for more us that he may be willing to do it. And yeah I'm all about it my team needs me but just human ideals it's not enough time. Three for you'd have for you to bounce back and be ready to go on Tuesday. But when they play like this in an Al Horford plays like this. That's when you start to dream a little bit that's where somebody who picked I don't hear a. No idea. And now come on and got ya nobody. Different product from conservative bottom have a commitment and some that are not around don't go on a government debt and it art. Little radical now. That's when you start to dream a little bit you feel good about taking the field. Vs the Cleveland Cavaliers. More specifically ask you feel good about taking the Celtics. Off. They were able to beat the wizards without marquee Morris from rest. Always Marco and any rest and he's now got them taking down below or million I don't know marquee horrific act amendment to talk to employers Italy yeah okay joining. But top fifty I don't. Well I did your clear I can't by the people might not realize it wasn't the same show. When the Celtics were down 02 yeah it was a bad moment you think certainly and that's series it was a bad moment if you think I was a nervous yeah I don't want. I am I nervous I'm nervous but I think those two games at home to the worst team in the playoffs does that same team. If not the same team is not dancing whatever they weren't the same team. In that same series they lost those two games and then they bounced back imperfect now changed up the lineup but they they put the personnel improved. Al Horford played Vatican the marriage Avery got. Benched eight Avery Bradley played badly are they start to get I and they won three road games again notes against the bulls and and and that's not a big deal. But that's one of the things that translated from regular season to postseason Celtics were the best team in the eastern conference on the road. This year and when they absolutely needed. To clean up those they need to win all their road games against the bulls need it. I let's clear this up. Text machine says I am a dentist. Natural teeth can in fact sometimes. Be re implanted her right although while success rate is not really high especially in adults. It was a natural tooth by the way and not as someone set a cap. Sell to the dentist says the dentist says that won't Anderson it is that handled it's well he's too busy but this dentist says. The shuttle not try it sounds that were but he said it's not a high success for so tell me about the success rate when I'm sad and it's not it's not a high success. What's the percent but I don't understand a bit. So waiting to be what I think that the success rates higher which it's which doesn't surprise me but what does it fell back out alright yeah I don't what does surprise me from this dentist. Yeah and I want to some credentials here OK I don't as the media are can be attributed the guy whatever radio to public debt it's. Yeah assembling an anti identity around now our cars at I wanna know. The process by by which this works revelers. Some used but it to speculate that says OK boom. Back to my natural habitat publish our users have not yet refuses back together are one and apple. By with your pipe I would knock on their part with their front well ideally an all star win back off. I'm sure they were worked your way up to it someday dentist I don't wanna go to Ask.com. Coming up and hurt us not as rough. I also don't know and now our our dentist friend here who you are now calling cordoned portrait of what went argues that and on information he says and again he just says natural teeth can in fact sometimes be re implanted now I don't know if that is literally stick it up in there in the whole Larry and OK and at the top row at the body hit in the mouth with an elbow top row you're going up against gravity bottom row maybe you have a better chance to hear on the ground floor. I was really surprised how. Again it wasn't might suit but. Why they had a deal that then like ours tooth out but finished the game. You're at it like go to the dentist is out bags at. Arrowhead. Deep debt is. That they do that that sucks I feel bad for you but finished the game that he can go right to go to this the best offense in the city and bring her to with the ice and they would outta that. How many dentists are the Celtics here from right now. All. You know a problem so many so many remedies well I've rob I listener this smile again negativity thing and other real thing about it. That is. No thanks you know already that is calling and I'm a dentist because you called quest aren't gonna want to the one who said I'm a dentist and that it can now but they can happen I I I got I got somebody on 20% the same thing. She said in an app enemy. I got my tooth knocked out my junior high school match up that sucker back up into the socket and then and then it. The boards might I wouldn't feel that much eat after an enemy that's what happened that was as I do with that contained five days Mulder back to normal mechanics that are verbiage and sure of that soccer I just welcome only other ways we could sounds right. Soccer show that sucker right package there. That's soccer and there. To seems very painful. And it has to. He's done assumes no more Star Wars ever are the appellate Donna Barrett on and they can I don't know donors that they are blocker earns our past kids. Harper's. Romans. Bull's eyes which are awesome candy apples. I'm not really panic candy apples even if you're duty status from an athlete in the world. To lose the ball up that's a pretty extensive. It is too modest as to the job breaker there were averaging in Apple's campus. Yeah excellent coverage my terrible Southern Europe and dollars. 6177797937. Is telephone number text line it's been Holloman from the dead to stick to its banks haven't I haven't ever iPad is. I feel I mean dentists Elena Hollywood keeps Sports Radio WEEI. Bombing. That said it before it just spending continual Mays amazement last. Couple weeks with his ability to. Function on the basketball court and excel on the basketball court so and today's like. It's another chapter of that. Just amazed. Brad Stevens talking about Isiah Thomas I thought I did Thomas did get a little choked up speaking to Doris Burke after the game yet. Yeah yeah. And and she asked it as as politely and as nicely as she possibly co lead. But that was the time where you could tell. You know I'd like it's hip it's gonna hit I'm gonna hit him from time to time for the forever probably got at least for the foreseeable few. You look at it this way. This. Little sister. It's your little sister your five I think he's five years. A five or six years older than she was a you hear the stories of how. As a family. Of they would drive around together. For his basketball tournaments and age you wouldn't just really trying to. Distraught after he his goal was. To play in the NBA in the play and college basketball spent some time in Connecticut. At a boarding school and I got the scholarship to Washington and she has been. Looking up to do you think about it feat for those few who who have younger siblings. You know I just look out for an and best case and house without form and actress of stories and his entire life looking out for in this situation where he couldn't do anything no want to do anything about it. No single car accident and if you watch the clip. Of Isiah speaking at the at the funeral yeah I use all the pictures ever and you heard people talking about her. And it's just it's just a devastating situation. That you know people all the cliches are only gets easier with time and I'm not sure that's true. I almost wonder if his time on the court is the easiest time of Thursday yet. You know it's what sort of alluded to that yeah it's it's when you go home down and you're sitting at home. And and the thoughts come crashing in my guess is your busy you know you've got to be concentrating on what you're doing that's probably the respite that the however many minutes he's gonna play in that game at 48 minutes between the lines is when you as close as he can come. And not thinking about it and the minute he leaves the building it comes crashing back and. It's got a place to be right now Q tip of the team. That schedule. Of the playoff schedule it sure helps if something to do. And you know after the Celtics nowhere in the NBA finals bumped and then that without ever when you start thinking about how much I ask you start to. I'm just now tell you right now if they win a forget you know he is gonna ride his high horse on blue rubber. In the end this thing we will never hear the need to be aware of the duck boats. Are you getting a slap on the guy got the guys that are not about me and I cleaned out I don't know I now know. It merely be about Uga I didn't I want a ring no I thought I had everything. It would be nice but not a thought about early illuminated that pilots get the inside story of what happened we have I say as tooth on the line Obama could. Hi to all know. Our panel knows that. The boys I would guess sounds like Charles Barkley. What happened what do you what questioned apple. Cup how it. How is the best I thought I bet you we're gonna come with your own material to be on that little idea what happened Andy and I just wanted. Know what you come. How how is it going right now are you back in there. Non computer would be. Quite frank McCall. Okay and blog about how. That. Globe and I'd I'd love to do about it. I'd like I do that popped out yesterday that is popular figure stepped on the floor at all. No later edit all just up and oh yeah now that's class. What if you want more chance and I'm so much potential there now is to these calls and Eddie goes you have to question these are really hot. You and I'll ask questions on T. He should just loaded up with who owns yeah. You on for its right X perhaps you heard from a lot of people though who have two stories like I don't. Yeah we all have teeth pop yes pop put him back in higher Assad came out Tories out there Steven in New Hampshire next on Sports Radio stale in Hollywood keep. Did end. Now a fever with guns at the don't. Only that I believe you absolutely exhaust weaker please them you'd better believe you. Oh unless you're actually like us who don't want right out of images that your workers about it or call and it's unfair to have an immigrant. Why couldn't I couldn't tell we aren't I tried to look and feel when you look to what the BJP to look like indoor. It didn't look like that would intact so I'm I'm kind of wondering if it it might have been a bridge and that was kinda connected to them not you know. Is it it was a rage you know it's gonna get put back in in and it would have to be meant to the cute next. If it. Kind of a whole truth and that it's not. You're not likely inning usually when you you know you not to toot that you've got to break it all what you're not gonna knock the hole being guy yep can't imagine it to rootkit anchored in bone. Took part L likely that he. Description that is about all things sounds so is there is there a timeframe. Is there a timeframe here like you if it's the tooth like DO certain time where OK we get it back up in there and in this not a time we got a chance. Well big time credit sooner the better armed they yelled at big bill talk about putting it into. I'm kind of a solution you know whether it's milk her or cold steel sterile saline solution or what they do it when they put it back and they split it to the date and keep using like wires or. Some other kind of you know great eagle gorilla glue they actually use that. And they leave that air war in ought to like six months and I seen a whole bunch of people where you'll get if you put it right and it will it'll views and do almost more. Okay. Having said that everything you're talking about attended a function everything you've ever gonna get full function and nowadays where it implants and stop. You know nice likely that what they'll do lose relevance would put an airplane in the air and I have a brand new to. Both I mean thanks doctor Saturday they didn't put it back in profile it isn't there an end and then didn't stay sell out. Those out so I would say the chances of them being able to use this tooth again are probably gone the as mouthpiece tomorrow I I think that's about peace. The green but now she's gay I don't let them out Roscoe what my guess is that he's got to go toothless for the rest of the series. Yeah I would say I had him out these blogs and do like step carries through that finish phenomenon now that is the power Harmon does so I have all over the place. Laureate pay back out. Still to winning take out there now with their hand and to shake hands and I am. I'm also in not a guy just like really does get into like Tristan Thompson with his dollars mover her around like talking to talk the talk show when I don't know OK whatever it throughout their profit. I'll rotate back a better rotates down to stop talking and keep it keep that in there. They're Revver up accurate it would report with a Celtic I Gerald Wallace. Well when he was with Charlotte yet just nasty. Every fifty hanging out at different drool all over this product. It. I know. They get out we missed an opportunity to. Only and I think it's too if we could have asked who went to Colgate college all. Mentally and there is nothing but. I cannot. What 77797937. Dale and Holley with Keefe Sports Radio WE ED. This is live furnaces of yours you know you've lost a lot of stuff during games and you've never at a loss to the truth on your clearly wants to do it. Which do business on the front I hope not. Allow us to decide against it now gets hit it off but look this up but it. I forgot about now one of great. And I hear it Brian broadcast by the way mill the broadcasters. Lose it's even hesitate because that is sort of in March interpreted instructor. Would've but still attitudes there constitute a bigger Diaz. Calm and collected as he was freaked out. There are freak out. Are black out altitude is set at their for the next seven innings and it is also a click away. Would you like acts that would constitute exactly what temple on a partner. I got to ask you guys at that is it came up last week with the coffee cup on the earn it and yes I'm fairly certain that we broken at least. Seven or eight different Geneva convention codes out there right now I'm. Somebody. Heated air lunch their fish for lunch in the microwave yeah. All and embarrass the guy. Out there it reeks in here. Dale when you're on the program we got bigger fish a lot bigger issue in pitch and that's not the flag and it. From the site at I I covered up and and DO Aggies opened the group quicken up. It should microwave. That that's just consider yourself lucky that you're not trapped in a broom and food. And overwhelming fish outweigh all the systems work and for the man tow days as the good looks great the thirty point six important. Place now. 36. To maybe work into it stumbled to the close as the next I told them this is payback treatment pizza from the couple weeks he hit it really do. And there's a microwave is not the problem the problem is the fish for. After gives appears bird afterwards. Is this in Tennessee this nasty. So I don't like skinny smelly Andy and I. A little work in on the skinny part its roots could. It's still finish. Now only grounder. With this but it been like I hate when a smelled an all right. Back to the why won't you be on the cookie died dammit that worked so well for somebody else here 6177797937. Mike's a new name and Mike NATO. It is talking guys began glad my semester is almost over so there's that. You know on the Celtics. I look at that it how to do and I have a sister myself who's around trying to Thomas's age and I know I would a lot fair you know I would just die inside. I wouldn't even be able to function anymore so. Let him let alone being out on that court. Let alone playing as well as he has which is a testament to kind of character but he has been my heart goes out and earn that kind is that obviously just crashing. But you know I like that get that the MVP awards will be held until after the season after that the champion has been crowned. And I think it's time it has been all we regard as someone who can beat in the discussion but maybe more of pot it. Considering he's an ankle high rough part and LeBron but. If he goes kind of player here and maybe he doesn't win a ring but if he's able to lead them to say game set against Cleveland. Again I think the NBA finals but they fought sort a Golden State for example. Did that catapulted the top two or they're at the leading candidate to win against the. No not unloading the vote he's been Don Carty said he Garrity said of the vote exam done and I think yeah. We'll find out before the NBA finals we'll we'll know who the MVP is an and I don't think he's an MVP in the late if it do what I think he's top five candidate may probably five probably five on the I think is gonna go to Westbrook. I think you'll get it and I away triple double things kind of overload for Wesley webpart and where experts in the conversation hearts in the conversation coli. LeBron Isiah Thomas I think. Eagles are probably have probably would be they don't even occur in on your list now is it an MVP this year. Yemen no lawyers have anybody. Now Kazuo Vista ready stayed healthy I think Durant would have he had a terrific comeback season beat the guy in the series probably a couple of votes is John Wall law had a hit an awesome year. Great season yeah I gotta tell you we we did this how to in this last night it's impossible to do. MVP conversations are good. A topic Mike New Haven but we often talk about top ten players in the league. And I just had a list together. It's it's. Can't do. Well do you you really can't because you know there's so many guys. After the gonna play out playoff team and I movie who would be candidates who will be talking candidates. On the sixteen playoff team. There are ton of guys. Just kind of so don't just teach. Right out of some interplay OK so Anthony Davis didn't make the playoffs. You avoid the markets didn't make the playoffs. Carl Anthony towns that make the playoffs and that's three right there where you. You look at the season that a pound had a look at the season that Davis had it really. Those aren't top ten players let alone. John Wall and in Bradley deal and CJ McCollum and and and game dollar and all these guys yet and and you know Klay Thompson. And stepped curry green or what that means you weekly counseling and green because carries in there yep yeah if you really goal. Over the that terrific players in the league. Going to be leaving out you have another top ten in resale of these guys could have or homeless if it is. While the east is always looked upon as Artie got LeBron and you know either his Miami super team are clearly super team that how much other talent is there. But I think you're seeing it was wall and deal with the DeRozan and Lowry with the Greek freak really coming on Paul George Jimmy Butler lake. Millsap and all the sudden the east I still think you know if you stack him up the of the top ten were the top ten conference the conference the west is better but it's a lot closer than he. Yeah it's tough it's tough to figure it out but but I do think Isiah Thomas. By dint of his 28 points a game in and out six assists. Player efficiency rating yeah. That the Celtics record. All the things that he was able to do throughout the season gets here he's a legitimate MVP candidate he won't win it but legitimate candidate. Dance and Hampton beach hey Dan I don't. Hey guys later today a zealot on. Actually talked about Avery Bradley while. You know ice back all the time doesn't help. It the way it help in all. Are you thinking and changer in the back on our off bulk senders you gonna guard Butler who can grab. You wouldn't be. Blocks without. Without grabbing my thoughts that would history and they help the quicker Carter. Scored the next. There is now. Contractually that's tough conversation about a minute to see it it's. I don't picture indeed coming close to Max I can't figure awareness bottom but your your first comment about Avery Bradley. 100%. Accurate. And I like what he did after the series. It always got a big trash talker have always but I believe he's the next when he retires will be a a great analyst basketball analysts now. A wife and I love a lot alike into it I don't ever set them I don't but let him listen to American League nobody said that the Celtics to win the NBA title either appoint listened to the way he describes the game in imposed game stuffing them got a really nice job of summarizing. What happened out there as as. Honest as he can be as a member of the team so. But I like what he said about Jimmy Butler respectfully. That you know I didn't like with Jimmy Butler said about after an after game five Butler said. Can't let a guy like Avery Bradley do that. If I didn't I give members backed every night and I just. Expect there's an arm pumping his tires. I expect and I elected and I turned and missile could hit a great job on Jimmy Butler. In that Syria Cuba like into the collars point you know I I would you Bradley and smarts great having those guys go up against wall and deal but. What is or 47 we're supposed to go like there's the score top really aren't they don't jump on Beale are popular slogan averaged 2530 game but just try to make it difficult for you doesn't he does and he made some great played that great defensive plays. Those salaries. What Evan Turner this offseason Dana Bradley we get more than I guess so gigabyte up your Macs Cuba's closer than we'd like to thank. And you also. It's just should point out Bradley's defense. And look at the Celtics they didn't that it went by an incredible margin throughout the regular season can he beat teams ran averaged right at 3.2 game. Our on on on the year. So. That means they're going to be a lot of close games and in close games and go to that team's top score what whether it was Jimmy Butler in the last series or. A Bradley dealer or wall in this one. You gotta have somebody who can knock him down and Avery Bradley's Erica. 6177797937. Is telephone number text line 37937. Talk about Paul Pierce will let him into the discussion as well welcome back just a couple of minutes. Dylan Hollywood keeps Sports Radio W media.

Our Glorious Leader Artem recently took to Google+ to air his grievances about Trusted Voice, the feature that recognizes your voice and unlocks your phone accordingly. What happens when Trusted Voice is off. Specifically, Artem was complaining about Trusted Voice automatically, and seemingly randomly, turning itself off. This is annoying because it means when asking Google Assistant, or Voice Search on non-Pixel phones, the phone has to be manually unlocked before it answers.   Left: as you can see, Trusted Voice is off. Right: the Trusted Voice setup phase. This may be a bug limited to the Google app v6.10 beta, but I've found it happens with versions prior to that on my Nexus 6P. I'll set Trusted Voice up, and it'll work as intended for a little while - say a month - but then one day I'll ask it to play some music or set a timer and it'll say 'I can't do that as your phone needs to be unlocked' or something similar. Rinse and repeat. If Google wants to be the leader in the voice assistant market, it's crucial Assistant works as intended. This means improving the reliability of the OK Google command and ensuring it works 100% of the time. We'd be interested to hear your comments on this, and see if it's related to specific phones or versions of the Google app. Let us know in the comments!

Randomly works at times and other times it simply doesn't. mbarna I've been experiencing this bug on a Nexus 5x throughout the summer of 2016. Haven't seen it crop up recently though. Gonzales It happens on my 5X as well. I was chalking it up to Action Launcher 3 but it still happens with no launcher active. Very frustrating Van_Hammersly Same here. Nexus 5X. Although it happened on Nexus 5 and previous phones as well. Always took a reinstall. Artem Russakovskii Your GIF at least shows the voice prompt and then the lock. With Assistant, you just see the lock, and the voice prompt only shows up after you unlock, which... well, is just as frustrating. Chris Ledbetter Mine on my pixel will show a message saying i have to unlock the device and the prompt is no longer up forcing me to do it all over again. SMH Not a big deal, just something that should be flawless from a search giant... The Fink it happens on Samsung phones as well. Arie Yup, this is happening to me for quite a while.. Nexus 6P, on 7.1.1 blassster This has happened to me before as well, most recently after applying this month's security patch. Anthony McCann Well, on the plus side, at least the voice command was for a good cause Ailín Ó’S This has always happened to me, it's never worked. I have my phone in Irish/Gaeilge and Google in English (Ireland). Goyam Jain This issue has been with me on the Galaxy Su Edge running Android Marshmallow since when I bought it in November. It sucks when it happens JPJ My XL works sporadically and I'm using the Jan update. John Doe Trusted Voice isn't even available on the Nexus 6. I believe it used to be there but I don't know what happened. JasonIvers Did anyone ever find out why the Nexus 6 doesn't have that option? I never did see a reason, just that it was the case. It generally doesn't affect me, as I have trusted devices most places I would actually consider using it. Noeltorious Used to be there, and if you toggled it on it would toggle itself back off. Must've been really broken for them to disable and then remove it digitalcircuit I've had a similar issue where "Say 'Ok Google' any time" keeps turning off a split second after I enable it. Checking logcat points to "AlwaysOnHotword start recognition failed with error 14" and "sound_trigger stdev_load_sound_model failed." Upgrading/downgrading Google Search doesn't help. Frustratingly enough, this was working fine for a month or two on CM 13.. then broke. Then worked again when upgrading to CM 14.1.. then broke a month later. Nexus 6. Logan Snyder I have a 5X, I haven't noticed trusted voice turning off randomly, but I've noticed the "Ok Google command" has a lower and lower recognition rate until it becomes abysmal and almost never recognizes the command. I have to retrain the voice mondel like once a month. chinna_rao I've been having this problem with my device for quite some time but then, it just blew up when I repeatedly tried "OK Google" ing it...Samsung Note 7 matteventu "it'll work as intended for a little while - say a month" You are lucky then. With Pixel XL it happens that you setup the "Ok Google" always on and as trusted voice, and after HOURS it stops responding, forgetting the "vocal-training" you made. And there's no a toggle for this, you have to reinitiate every fu**ing time the vocal setup. Ernie Mine is fine sproc Well at least your fingerprint reader still exists, lol. Some of these issues are like Win9x era crap. ehTuBrutus Happens to me Everytime I switch between user accounts. Gives me a pop-up saying it has been turned off so I took it to be by design. I take it others have it happening even when not switching accounts? I wonder if Artemis has more than one user açcount on his phone? Andrew Palmer I used it to skip a track the other day. I didn't like the next track either so tried to do OK Google again. No response. Joe Mihalich I experienced this twice on the first day I received my pre-ordered Pixel XL. After i retrained it the second time, it hasn't happened again. Lucky me. Now if they would just fix the stupid freeze/lockup issue i can get on with my life. Brian Demodulated Trusted Voice is always turned on for me but often when I give a voice command I'm prompted to unlock my phone before the command is executed. So annoying. whispy_snippet Yep, I experience all of the above on my Pixel. Sucky. shamatuu yep nexus 6P. been turned off on its own for couple of months and yet Google seems to not care to fix it. really hope they fix it ASAP because they not what they used to be. blakeleeper Its happening on my Pixel XL v6.10.33.21 Kwetsima Maluleke Its been doing this to me for ages. About a year maybe. David Hyman Me too but it has been working a lot better for me for a while now Sharondhart Google is paying 97$ per hour! Work for few hours and have longer with friends & family! !ue210c: On tuesday I got a great new Land Rover Range Rover from having earned $8752 this last four weeks.. Its the most-financialy rewarding I've had.. It sounds unbelievable but you wont forgive yourself if you don’t check it !ue210c: ➽➽ ➽➽;➽➽ http://GoogleFinancialJobsCash500WebCompanyGetPay$97Hour... ★★✫★★✫★★✫★★✫★★✫★★✫★★✫★★✫★★✫★★✫★★✫★★✫★★✫★★✫★★✫★★✫★★✫★★::::::!ue210c:....,...... Les Deplorables Yep...ages here too! Annoying. Michael Gerberich I have a similar issue with Trusted places. It works for a while and then just stops working. S7 Edge. vwnut13 Didn't OK Google used to work with a locked screen? Jimas Happens on my Nexus 6P Google v6.10.33.21. It started happening maybe a week or two ago, but it resets almost like every 2-3 days. Zaptor99 On my Note 4, I don't have Trusted Voices, I have "Personal Results". I turned it on. But If I go to Maps, Settings, Navigation, Ok Google, then the same screen from google app appears, but instead of "Personal Results", I see "Trusted Voice" and it's turned off and it then automatically turns off "Personal Results" in google app. Very confusing. Grey Are we reporting bugs on AP now? Because there are tons of bugs to report, especially with Google Now. It doesn't make sound anymore for one. If your phone is in landscape mode and you get it to turn on, it will turn on then stop because it's in landscape mode and you have to repeat it. Not to mention it does not respond every time. And try saying "remind me tonight dentist appointment at 11 am", cause what it will give you is a reminder for "tonight dentist appointment" due at 11 am. It's got issues. We gonna call them on all of it and try and get some pressure on Google to fix stuff? You gotta do it AP, we can't. Ibrahim Yusuf It happend for me on my nexus 5x on marshmallow, even updating to nougat didn't fix it. But I fixed it by deleting the voice model and retraining again. I got an answer on reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidQuestions/comments/5bgngq/cant_activate_always_on_ok_google_voice_detection/ Amir This is not new. I've been having this issue since the beginning of 2015 on my Nexus 6, 6P and now on Pixel XL. Ive completely given up on that feature. opticalgenesis Same here :( - also bonus points for Muse Himesh Kulkarni Same problem here but works less than a month, maybe like a few days. Also, I don't get any reply, it's just blank (doesn't work). Peter Me: "OK Google" Pixel: "Bleep" Me: "Read last message" Pixel: "You have one last message, would you like to hear it?" Me: "Yes" Pixel: "OK, cool, cool." ... Me: "WTF?" Andre Only once this has happened on my Nexus 5X. I have not experienced this issue in a while. jack_k1 I absolutely loath saying"OK Google". It just doesn't roll off the tongue. I feel like I'm gargling. demarcmj Even if it did "roll off the tongue," four syllables is just way too much. Fatty Bunter Google Home accepts "Hey google" too, which is much better. Hopefully they'll add this to phones too. Cory S Hey Google has a much lower activation rate than Okay Google for me, which is a shame because I hate that hot phrase. jack_k1 Try using Trusted Face when you have a long flowing beard. Hah! nxtiak YES!!! My Pixel XL suffers this issue, so f'ing annoying, I thought I was going crazy! JimOnTheBeach Yes happens on my new LG V20.i thought I was doing something wrong. Shawna Bartron This has never worked for me. LG Stylo 2 Travis James I don't have this issue, but I will keep yelling at my phone when driving "OK Google" with no response. When I have a chance to pick up my phone and unlock, I see that it can't reach Google, even though I have connectivity. Super annoying. Brandon Buchanan I use this feature all the time, but never have trouble with it on my Nexus 5x. King_Android Expect bugs with Beta. Uninstall beta clear data enable using default Google now launcher and all is well. catalysto For as long as I've had my 6P, I've had a similar problem. After a week or so, saying "OK Google" with the screen off stops working. If I toggle the settings off and back on, it works again for a while. But then usually by the time I actually need it, it has stopped working again. I gave up on it and just use the microphone button now for voice commands. Van_Hammersly It's done this to me on at least three separate phones over the past few years. Random and annoying. Each time I think when I get a new phone it'll stop doing it, foolishly. Parneet Singh It always does after few days on my nexus 5 X. Ok google stops responding to voice commands dmo580 That's not the same as Trusted Voice turning off. You're talking about OK Google detection just failing. The screenshots here specifically show the toggle being turned off. Let's not mix up two issues. Yvonne Campbell I have this issue as well, where both the 'trusted voice' and 'detection from any screen' toggles get turned off. gtoninn I have had the same thing happen to me. In addition to that the most recent update to the Google app has left my manually requested google searches with voice (IE I hit the voice search button), getting stuck and then the Google App has to be restarted. Also on a 6P Pyrazol You mention this now? It's been doing that to me for AGES. I thought switching from the Moto X to the Nexus 6 would ease my woes, but nooo. I just don't use that shit anymore because it's so freaking unreliable. dmo580 You don't even have trusted voice on the Nexus 6 as an option in the Google App. Keep in mind this issue is a very specific one regarding trusted voice. Moto's own implementation of always on listening is different as they pay for the license themselves. Cypress Frankenfeld Has anyone logged an issue on the Android bug tracker? I'd gladly star it. Joe Mine's always done this, it just randomly stops working. I always thought it was just because of updates causing it to shut down and needing to be reactivated. sea_hawk I have the same issue for a month. after I joined the 7.1.1 beta and then left the beta, but still experiencing the issue. sea_hawk Never mind... just tried enabling it, and it finally let me do that... not sure what happened. But in the past when I tried enabling trusted voice, it would ask me to input my pattern, but after I do that, the button stays "off"... sorry, not of much help HotRodJohnson Welcome to the world of the Nexus 6 users. The forum for this feature says, Hey Nexus 6 user, you can forget about it! Noeltorious I actually have a similar issue on the Pixel XL. I'll say OK Google and it will wake the screen up and show me the lock screen. Subsequent OK Google's or swiping to launch from the lock screen just point me to use my fingerprint to login. Once I use the fp-sensor the screen unlocks with Assistant launched. Weird and annoying, haven't figured out steps to reproduce because it's so random I don't think it's toggling off though because I never have to toggle anything on to fix it. RecalcitrantOne Just commenting to echo what others have said, happens to me and my 5x. Wouldn't mind being able to set my own "hot phrase." Either way, the emphasis is wrong with "Okay Google." The emphasis is on the second syllable of okay, but first for Google so it's not smooth. Rob I also noticed it deactivated many times, making it unreliable (Nexus 6P 7.1.1). It's been deactivating since the summer but it's a few weeks it hasn't anymore. I hope this gets addressed. Ashlynn This happens for me. Google Pixel version 7.1.1 - Google version 6.10.36.21amd 64. This recently started happening for me. Had no issues a few weeks ago. Chris Tashjian Same here!! It's been resetting on me daily for the last couple weeks jaxjoe Same issue with my PixelXL - was working up until 2-3 weeks ago. Now it doesn't stay turned on for more than a few hours at a time Luke Taylor Ohhhhhh yeah. It'd happened to me only 4 or 5 times on my 6P in the last year, but suddenly in the past two weeks it's happened to me about 6 times- which is how I found this article just now. Come on, Google! stephen Galaxy s7. turns off in middle of voice searches and even while I'm typing in a search. Annoying to have to start typing all over again! Version 6.0.1 Niels Buekers I get this on my Pixel XL since a week or 2.. nikov I've had it happen a few times in the past on my Nexus 6P, but it has become very common in the last month or two. I'm running in to real issues with it at this point. bryguy76 I have a Pixel XL, worked fine for the first month, and then started turning off all the time. It's so annoying. Miguel Dey My pixel just started doing this.. any fix for it yet? Random! LG G3 D855, stock fw. Started happening to me a few days ago. Now this feature freaks out every couple days. Russ We have two Pixels and both do this. It's infuriating. It'll work flawlessly some days and then sometimes we'll say "OK, Google" and just get the lock screen and then go into the settings and find Trusted Voice has turned itself off arbitrarily. Trueblue711 It must be a bug with Google Play services. I'm one of the very few people with a Nexus 6p still running Android 6.0 and this bug happens to me all the time. Ronny Keller Disabling "Battery Optimization" for the item "ok Google enrollment" seems to do the trick for some users. Aaron Kelly I hope this does the trick. I'm trying it. It makes sense. Joe Mihalich This is still happening to me with google app 6.10.37.21. Kris Tyler This is happening at least monthly on my Samsung Galaxy S5. Then it makes me retrain it and opt in. EVERY FREAKING TIME. So annoying, especially when it won't dial numbers when I'm driving. It's enough to make me consider an Apple. Al It happens on Pixel too. I'm starting to wonder if it's anytime the phone restarts. SSt Me too. Nexus 6p Laksamana Just happened to me since last week (Galaxy S6 on Android 6.0.1). Kept asking me to opt back in into Trusted Voice. Andrew Slater I have a 6p on version 7.1.1 and it had been doing this for a month or 2. But instead of it turning off a couple months apart, it turns off after only a couple days. Very annoying. JC Pixel XL, Android 7.1.2, Google App version 6.12.19.21.arm64. Does this multiple times a day, multiple times a week. So annoying it's driving me crazy. Been this this since my Nexus 6P a year ago Austin Ingram So annoying. It stays on for maybe a day or two then it's off again. Austin Ingram It may be related to training it in noisy environments - if you do that then try to activate it when it's quiet it may not recognize your voice and disable it for "security". Ankit Sud It's happening frequently with my Pixel as well. Defeats the biggest use case for Assistant in my opinion. Kyle Bailey Still happening with my Pixel. Is there any fix? bluescrubbie Just spent a while on chat with Google support. They say they've fixed the issue and we'll be rolling it out in an update soon. Patrick Ledwith Really? That's a relief. Garth Hedley I have Nexus 6P and 7.1.1. so fault is not restricted to earlier Android versions. I've set up TV numerous times. Each time after phone locks, Google app voice says can't do that phone is locked. Tatyana Tatyana I turn it on and the same day the "Trusted Voice" option will turn itself off. Drives me fucking bananas. PeterDTown Infuriating! It seems that every time I try to use this feature it's turned off again. Katie Conforti Seems if you don't use your phone for 4 hours the setting gets disabled. So annoying, makes assistant nearly worthless. https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/6093922?hl=en Aaron Kelly My 6p has been doing this for about the last month or two. Every 3-7 days it happens. It's frustrating. I use the Trusted Voice to dial all the time, so when it doesn't work because of something like this, it makes me mad. Shannon Doak It is happening with my Pixel as well. stsin 6P on fi started doing it after I went off the beta os test due to severe battery issues. Dušan Todorović "trusted voice" my ***. After setting it for who knows how many times, yesterday, when i wanted it to start Clash of clans, that annoying answer pulled my nerve with "actually i cant do that while the device is locked, please, unlock blablabla.." for the last time. I disabled it. Guys doing the Ok Google "magic", clearly this is happening for a while and to many people, independant of android version, root opt, device, launcher, gapps version, google+ version, etc. Either fix the darn thing or stop pretending to be Siri's competitor. This sucks big time. Simon Jude I have this exact problem! I'm on an LG K7, anyone actually know how to fix this? Paul Kopalek My Nexus 6P turns the 'Anywhere' feature off INSTANTLY when I turn it on. Even when wiping Google app data, clean flashing the 7.1.1 ROM all over again, and disabling Battery Optimization for 'OK Google Enrollment. This is infuriating. Dave Segal HTC One M8 and galaxy 7 Yvonne Campbell Yes!! It's not just my trusted voice that gets turned off but my detection from any screen. Suddenly I can't just say "ok google" and get a response without touching my phone. Rather defeats the purpose. I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 5. Another issue I'm having, but think it would be a phone issue, is that I have answer calls with voice commands turned on, and even though it stays turned on, it does not work anymore. PP Saini I have the opposite issue. The "any time" option will not stay off. I toggle it off, but am immediately able to say OK Google with my phone responding. Check the setting, and it is oddly back on. Kristina Starck Constantly on my Note 5. It also pops up a window asking me what I just said everytime I listen to anything with my headphones plugged in. Even disabling the assistant altogether doesnt stop the spam. Callahan Jason Droid Maxx 2 - used to turn off randomly, more recently I can not keep it on. If I switch it on back out to previous screen then go back-it will be off Salazryl Ismail I have this issue too on my SGS3 and HTC One M8 Jean-Sebastien Penney Same here about once a week Nexus 6p Stapin Does this on an LG KV8 as well. Restarting the phone works, sometimes I have to since the assistant fails to respond even after the phone is manually unlocked Elijah Francis Pixel XL: Voice search keeps shutting off for me shortly after using it. Also the search bar won't even begin to load search results either.... REALLY annoying when you're driving and want search somewhere with a simple voice command. After this bug shows up seemingly immediately I'm forced to restart the phone only for it to happen AGAIN. Google fix this shit.

Opinion: Even if you can, you probably shouldn't buy a Google Pixel anymore David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/05/01 2:09pm PDTMay 1, 2017 66 Plus 1 on G+ 263 Share on Facebook 60 Share on Twitter Total Shares389 Editorials Pixel Pixel XL The Google Pixel is a notoriously hard phone to get a hold of. Persistent stock issues have plagued Google's first "in-house" handset from day one, and things really are little to no better six months after the launch event. Honestly, it's a bit embarrassing just how consistently incompetent Google seems to be at keeping a reasonable inventory of phones available for purchase. But setting that aside, as one of the Pixel's most ardent evangelists, I think there's something it's probably time for me to come clean on: Even if you could buy a Pixel today, I really think you shouldn't. The Pixel is a product with generation-one product issues. The Bluetooth performance is horrid. It's not waterproof. The bezels really are due for a shrink. I don't think the exterior coating on the black and blue variants is of a particularly high quality. The glass window gets scuffed up incredibly easily. The Snapdragon 821 is officially old news. And it doesn't support proper advanced network features across all four of the big US carriers. There are other flaws I could point to, and while none of them are too terrible, they do speak to the slightly-rushed development cycle this phone seems to have been subjected to. Sure, Google got some things astoundingly right: the performance, the camera, the larger software experience. In fact, I think the Pixel is easily the best Android smartphone ever for these strengths, at least if we're talking about me personally as a user (your mileage, obviously, may vary). But for all the great, smooth, fast, clean, pure, simple, natural, and various other adjective-members singing in the Pixel-praise cavalcade, this phone is not the one to buy right now. For starters, Google continues to ask what is an increasingly laughable amount of money for the model most of us want - the 128GB XL - at a staggering $870. Sure, Apple charges the same for an iPhone 7 Plus 128GB, but I'm under no illusion that this comparison in any way favors Google. The iPhone comes with Apple customer service (with actual stores), a longer software support period going forward, and runs no real risk of poor resale value. The Pixel? Google's online support is iffy at best, we know the phone will be unsupported by October 2018, and I have a strong feeling generation-one Pixel resale values will drop like a rock once the new phones are announced. And that really is why, if you haven't pulled the trigger on a Pixel yet, you should just wait. It's overpriced, under-supported, and competing phones like the Galaxy S8 offer a whole lot more technology for your money. The Galaxy S8+ is $20 less than a 128GB Pixel XL, and I would argue it is far and away the better smartphone value. That amazing display, brand-new Snapdragon 835 processor, jaw-dropping design and packaging, and the full support of all our American carriers' latest LTE advancements could each be a reason on its own to put the Galaxy S8 above Google's smartphone. Do I still prefer using the Pixel over the S8? Sure. But I wouldn't buy a 128GB Pixel XL over a Galaxy S8+ today. That would be, frankly, a bit silly. If Google was asking $670 and not $870, the discussion would probably change, but they aren't. You've got to pay full price, and there's no way I could recommend anyone do that. If you're still on the fence about the Pixel, let me try to push you over: wait for the next generation. I realize that this sort of thinking can devolve into a rationale that encourages you to never upgrade anything because something newer, faster, and better is constantly on the horizon. But in this case, I think it's a consideration that is worth weighing more seriously than usual. Many of the Pixel's biggest flaws relate to Google's inexperience producing a smartphone. Issues that only come up as you try to mass-produce and distribute a product with a real marketing campaign that creates real demand, and the phone gets into the hands of "real" users who aren't part of the now-derailed Nexus phone hypetrain. Inside Google, expectations were no doubt managed, realities realized, and priorities accordingly re-calibrated after this first launch. (Side note: if the Bluetooth performance on the next Pixel is as bad as the first one, I may scream, Google.) Meanwhile, the things that make the Pixel great aren't going anywhere. The next Pixel will be fast, it will take great photos, and it will offer a wonderfully unfettered Android experience. Those that make it less than great? Google is no doubt drilling down through the worst of them in order to ensure the Pixel 2 - or whatever it's called - won't make the same mistakes that the original did (waterproofing, please). And one of the primary reasons to try the Pixel in the first place - to be on the very bleeding edge - really only remains true from a software standpoint. Older phones like the Nexus 5X and 6P don't even let the Pixel have an advantage there, as they're on the same update track until around the time the next Pixel phones launch. If you absolutely need a smartphone soon and the Pixel is tempting you, ask yourself this: Can you deal with a Moto G5 Plus for six months if it means having a better Pixel down the road? While as a reviewer I have the admitted luxury of not needing to consider such things, were I in such a position, I'd have little in the way of a counterargument to offer. Sure, you'll take a resale hit on anything you buy now, but the Pixel is going to face a much, much steeper devaluation curve in that time than any budget phone. Buying a Pixel right now just doesn't make sense. I love my Pixel XL, but I'm officially done recommending the phone to friends and relatives. Instead, I'll tell them to wait, or to get the Galaxy S8 they were probably going to buy anyway. Tags editorial google pixel google pixel xl opinion pixel xl subscribe ...

Google really shot themselves in the foot with availability. My name is…. No, they shot their foot with huge bezels, with lack of waterproof, lack of dual speakers, no real camera progress compared to nexii, meh battery life, meh screen. No real selling point besides being pure android phone. This phone had iphone price but was worst on so many levels (no A10 SoC, no iphone-fast NAND, no 4yrs updates) Oneplus on the other hand........ M. Luciano Also has none of that stuff, but is cheaper? My name is…. yes, half price cheaper. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ The black screen issue kind of negates anything else ;) Michael Hannigan What's the "black screen issue"? Carson Saldanha YOU WANT THE PIXEL TO HAVE THE A10 CHIP?? BHAAAAAAAHAHAHA My name is…. No, i want it to have a cheaper price, or be better somehwere else, like the Galaxy. STOP BEING RUDE Carson Saldanha https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CYF7C6hVAAAKF-_.jpg Tr3ple Shut up troll ,nobody likes you I see lmao My name is…. You know when you see the dumb guy, he always adds 'lol' or 'lmao' at the end of his sentence. And his syntax is always wrong. STFU and GTFO Liam Bulkley "You know when you see the dumb guy... And his syntax is always wrong." "You are an [sic] ignorant" Don't cut yourself on the glass. Michael Hannigan They have that - The Nexus 5x. Тарас Мукин You keep hating Pixel in the comments, but you only look at numbers. But they doesn't matter when it comes to Google. Software experience does. My name is…. That's a stupid argument Тарас Мукин And saying that somebody's argument is stupid without any explanation is a much smarter argument. My name is…. Would you pay 900$ bucks for Nexus 5 just because "Software experience matters"?? Carson Saldanha Nobody said they were paying just for the "software experience" Matt Tapac said that specs don't matter, the software experience does. That heavily implies that people are paying for the software experience. Carson Saldanha xD here we go again drunken_bastard Pixel and Pixel XL have better cameras and screens than any iPhone. The difference in SoC and other bits of hardware, they don't translate into any real world speed differences. Pixel also has great battery life. Perhaps some hands on time may do you some good. supersanborn Given that they continually sell out of the limited stock they have, none of what you cited matters. If they had a ginormous supply of units and THEN couldn't sell, then perhaps you would be on to something. My name is…. What was the availability in the first place? You think they produced many? No way Jose, i bet Galaxies and iphones outsold pixels by multiple times supersanborn We don't exactly know what they had hoped to produce or even what they actually produced, so your point remains conjecture. And who here is suggesting that Samsung and Apple phones didn't outsell the Pixel? My name is…. * by multiple times James Betti Sadly, Google isn't keeping the Pixel in stock because they don't care about their hardware line. Google makes most of its money through ads and personal data. It's a shame, but it explains why they discontinue successful products and barely have much in stock. Excellent phone by the way. Michael Hannigan Well, that's easy to rectify. Do like Amazon and offer the same exact hardware with "special offers" for a lower price. Then you get to see ads everywhere, even your home screen and app drawer. Pretty cool. Michael Hannigan Yes, they did. It was in the millions. Max "no real camera progress compared to nexii, meh battery life, meh screen." Ok, so you don't have a Pixel, we get it. My name is…. I'm not dumb, do you get that too? Xchris I think the consensus here is that you are talking bollocks. The pixel XL has an unbelievably good screen, one of the best battery life figures, still has the best camera out of any smartphone. Nobody who bought the pixel cares that much about any of your other points. In fact, what you are really saying is that you didn't like the pixel. Big deal! My name is…. Actually, i'm fighting the pixel in a nerdy community. Its expected that the consensus is that "i am talking bollocks". People here mainly wanna root their phones and put center clocks on status bar. they did the same with Nexii devices, its all about the software, but those phones were seriosly lacking (i used to own all Nexus devices after 4) Carson Saldanha So may I ask, what phone do you use now? My name is…. 1+3 Carson Saldanha Srsly!?!? Bruh, the OnePlus 3 has a Snapdragon 820 while the Pixel has a 821, a far better camera, better performance, and software. How is the OP3 better than the Pixel? Besides the price? I could probably understand if you had the OP3T, but no way. My name is…. You are an ignorant. 1) Check the speedtests, 1+3 is faster (because better nand) 2) Software is better on 1+3 (aosp with tiny mods) 3) Pixel has underclocked 821, thus 820 with a little bit of better battery life (1+3 has 1080p screen to tie this up) 4) 1+3 has 6gb ram (will be good for 4 years) 5) 1+3 is smaller than pixels, unbelievably thin 6) 1+3 has dash charging (world leading) 7) 1+3 has half the price 8) 1+3T is another story, far better Apply cream to the burn, son PS Yes Pixel has a better camera. Carson Saldanha Ignorance at it's finest. My name is…. Those are all FACTS, son. My name is…. Where are you, son? Jack Smith Have you ever even used a Pixel? Only Android phone i have used with zero touch lag. Can we also stop the name calling? Mason Andrew Maseda Hate to break it to you man. I own The One Plus 3T the Google Pixel the Nexus 6P and the Moto X pure edition. Lol. Guess witch one is my daily driver? The Pixel. Why? Better battery . Better cam. All around the most reliable phone. Even with my Nexus 6P I've had some issues here and there tiny ones. Like some days my battery life was abnormally shit and the next day it was great. The one plus 3T has tiny issues too. The Pixel is a phone that you wouldn't understand UNLESS YOU TRY ONE FOR A DAY. come back when you do. tansuperman Not sure why people think the pixel takes good pics. I have a pixel xl, 950xl, IPhone 7plus, and now the s8. In my opinion the pixel xl takes the worst pics. The lumia 950xl is stop dog. The pixel I can tell is just too overprocessed Michael Hannigan I think it applies mostly to low light pictures - absolutely nothing touches the Pixel in that respect - trust me. More generally, it applies to the software and hardware working together to create stunning (real) HDR pictures. But in low.light, which according to a friend of mine who is a smartphone camera freak (I am not), quality of low light pictures are what users are primarily interested in because he says "...any recent smartphone can take great pictures in daylight.". For me, I liked the flexibility of the V20 camera - not just the dual lenses, but the absolutely fantastic functions in the camera app. D13H4RD2L1V3 Um, the 821 consumes less power than the 820 at the lower clocks due to a more efficient binning process. Also, both the Pixel and OP3 use UFS 2 controllers. But on Nougat, the 3 uses F2FS for its filesystem. It's not a case of better NAND. It's a case of different filesystems. Michael Hannigan I think they should use FAT16. I miss it. Chris Rey I will say the Axon 7 is just as good as the OnePlus 3 and looks better. Suicide_Note The Pixel camera is definitely superior to what was in the 6P, and i say that as someone who currently owns them both. M. Luciano I use both on a daily basis. Agree with you 100%. So do objective measurements of the cameras. Pixel is the best on the market; 6P is decent but not great. andy_o On paper both cameras should be just short of identical, but the Pixel is so much faster in processing cause of the HVX dedicated core, plus the N6P throttles like crazy (in one of my photospheres tests in a warm room the Nexus 6 beat it every time). This is crucial especially with Google who is prioritizing computational photography probably on par or more with hardware camera specs. Also, I'm not sure if this is a hardware or artificial limitation, but HDR+ auto has completely different behavior on the Pixels. I can understand how someone who has only looked at the specs and not used a Pixel and N6P (especially in the summertime), can think that there's been "no real camera progress", but this guy is balls-deep in the "arrogance of ignorance". Michael Hannigan I think the reason for the difference in HDR+ in the Pixel is that it's" real HDR - it takes several pictures and then layers them. Other phones have taken a shortcut do doing that with one picture and it really doesn't achieve the same. Except in one case - manually setting HDR in my Note 7 gave absolutely stunning night time photos. Something I can't quite achieve with the built in software on the Pixel (but can with Photoshop). andy_o I was talking the difference between HDR+ auto in the Pixel and HDR+ auto in the previous phones. The auto behavior in the Pixel is different, but the HDR+ processing is basically the same. There's more info here: http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/11/21/deep-dive-closer-look-google-pixels-camera/#What_does_HDR_do If you feel nerdy enough I can link you to a paper on HDR+ by the Google computational photography team too :) Regarding the other phone cameras, the reason they do worse isn't exactly that they they're taking shortcuts, it's actually because they're doing it the traditional way, taking different exposures. Read the AP article linked above for details on how HDR+ is fundamentally different. Michael Hannigan You have OLED burn-in? I have about 8 hours SOT/day and don't have any. That would piss me off. Jason B Inverting colors for a bit while doing some extended reading helps. Black background with white text is easier on the eyes too. But yeah, static nav bar and notification area aren't great for OLED. There should be auto pixel shift to prevent it ... or Google should make more use of Immersive Mode. whispy_snippet Ugh. Like a broken fucking record here sometimes. Shawn Spring While some of your other points may/may not be valid, to say that the Pixel had "no real camera progress compared to nexii" just makes you sound ignorant. The S821 ISP alone would make the camera in the Pixel superior, not to mention the updated HDR algorithms. Get a Pixel owner and a 6P owner in the same room (I was both) and ask them to shoot with each others phone and see who prefers which. The 6P camera lag in HDR mode was inefficient at best and unbearable at worst. And it wasn't that long ago that OnePlus was using a broken invite system, had people lick their phones, and had a horribly gender insensitive marketing campaign. I'd probably not hold them up as the standard bearer against Google. Michael Hannigan They had people lick their phones? Why did they never ask me to do that? That's discrimination. I should have been asked to lick my phone. Brett Lewis I love my pixel after coming from a HTC 8x on Windows platform. Never liked Apple and never will. And lately after all the talk of Samsung's products (blowing up, red screens, other problems) I'm quite happy with my pixel. I don't need water proofing I'm not an idiot that takes my phone near water.. the I hardly notice the bezels after coming from a 4.3 inch 720 display.. The htc8x had one of the widest angle front cameras but I dont take selfies. This pixel does what I want and is fast doing it. And for first time experiencing Android I'm quite happy with buying this with the newest and best version available. TheHater So only idiots take their phones near water? I bet if you had a water resistant phone, you'd take it near water. Michael Hannigan What about the toilet? Who doesn't read the news when sitting on the shitter? Mariano Moreira I would definitely agree in terms of the Pixel XL vs iPhone 7 plus comparisons (Non-32GB model) Comparing the base iPhone 7 vs base Pixel...the iPhone 7 base had(has) slow Nand performance from what I have witnessed. The 32GB iPhone 7 vs base 32GB Pixel (5") seems like a closer comparison where the compromise is better battery life on the Pixel, faster Nand, and better screen. Again, I concur that looking at the Pixel XL vs iPhone 7 Plus leans more heavily towards Apple especially when comparing the 128GB models. Michael Hannigan If you buy from the Google store, they are carrier agnostic - absolutely 0 carrier bloatware. Mariano Moreira No. I have a Google Play(Bootloader unlocked) purchased Pixel. Normally used on Sprint or At&t. When I activate on Verizon: to get Vo-LTE calling with Verizon SIM and certain carrier settings it does a software update switching the phone over to the Verizon specific software build. If it was truly Carrier-agnostic it wouldn't force a Carrier specific Software build onto my non-Verizon model Pixel. Michael Hannigan You must have either bought it from Verizon or screwed something up. An unlocked phone doesn't suddenly become carrier specific like you describe Mike John Quincy Adams I don't one person who owns or says ’I sure wish I had a OnePlus.' Michael Hannigan I have - when I had the OnePlus One. Many people asked me about it. You can't deny that OnePlus phones offer an unbeatable value. They don't skimp on specs and sell for half the.price they should. asrat_24 I get you're trying to make fun of that guy but don't make ignorant statements while trying to do it. Oneplus makes good phones and people are interested enough nowadays to say that. Major Sceptic Agree on all points , a mid range device with a flagship price , perhaps Google will adjust the prices on the 2 ? for a company trying to expand it's phone sales it's going a funny way about it . Artem Russakovskii Well, usually at that point you start seeing significant discounts, but the Pixel is a misnomer in that regard to due to low stock and high demand. Max Exactly, I would revise that affirmation to state: "I've always felt once we are less than 6 months from the new iteration, it's a mistake to buy the existing product *at full price*." supersanborn I'll grant there's a case to be made for some phones where waiting can result in substantial discounts (especially from HTC/LG/etc). Probably a little of my bias sneaks in here. I prefer to have the newer device, and if I waited 6 months post-launch, it probably means I myself need to wait until the next launch. Max I'm with you there, I usually buy a phone at launch or a couple of months later at most but remember that we aren't regular customers, that's why we read and comment on this site ;). For many people out there it makes more sense to buy a phone six months after release if it comes with a nice worthy discount. M. Luciano This ^^ supersanborn Agreed, for some, shaving $100-200 off the price is all that matters. I usually caution folk pretty hard in the last 3 months before the new iteration drops if they have any form of new feature/size/color envy. supersanborn And yeah, I'm nowhere near the "normal" consumer :-) needa Supposed to be picking up a 32gb XL (Google) for $450 near mint in a couple hours. I might not get it, but a killer deal nonetheless. M. Luciano Smash that deal :) Very nice. needa A few little scratches on the back glass. Profit.

The lowest I've seen on Swappa was $695 for a black XL. supersanborn True. I usually find that the discounts are kind of on the "meh" side though until we hit release of new product. I always basically tell folks that you either buy it at launch until about 6ish months post-launch, and if you've held off that long, you should just wait until next launch and either buy the old product at a big discount or buy the new one. Matt I believe your use of misnomer was a bit of a misnomer. Artem Russakovskii I did use the wrong word, you're right. el_smurfo That's why I just picked up a 6p last year for $400. Most expensive smartphone I've ever bought, but the full release price was just not in my budget. Karly Johnston Battery issues? MisterAlex Maybe an anomaly... but not a misnomer. paxmos Where is this high demand you guys talk about?, I have yet to see a pixel in anyone's hand M. Luciano Really? I know over a dozen people who have or had them. paxmos Yep...I see lots of iPhones and Sammy's, even one Blackberry Z30, have only seen a pixel in the Verizon store. M. Luciano I feel like a nerd owning 4 Major Sceptic It does seem to have more of an enthusiast following , no shortage of pixels in my region , the usual brands , apple, Samsung, still seem to have the sales , I know not one person that has a pixel or wants one , and I think Google only has itself to blame on that front, Re : the cost of a pixels . Goblin Shark Finally, someone who knows what they're taking about - my head is just shaking in disbelief reading what these marshmallow brains that think they know about phones are saying on this comment thread lol Daishi Exactly. I have yet to see a Pixel in the wild. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ To be fair, HTC isn't used to such a high demand for their phones. Google unfortunately paid the price Daishi This made me LOL! A post full of WIN for sure!! Zoglog Actually it's probably because of all the RMA's they've gotten JD Thought that was obvious. syxbit I wonder whether we shouldn't wait for Pixel + 2. The next Pixel may technically be the first Google made product (current Pixel is made by HTC), so it's possible the Pixel 2 will have first gen problems. Still, I still have the N6P (after I scoffed at the Pixel price and refused to buy it), so I going to be looking for a phone soon. Good_Ole_Pinocchio HTC is also manufacturing the Pixel 2. Word on the street. Daishi That's too bad. I'll avoid this this phone as well... Captain On! Well, technically the iPhone is made by Foxconn, so... Don't expect Google to actually build their own facilities to produce hardware. Carson Saldanha Pretty sure they'll still be using HTC. Might have more control over the design this time around though. 4Ui812 The availability issue is a play out Nintendo's handbook. Good_Ole_Pinocchio 100% agree with the entire article... Do I want the Pixel Software Experience and Camera? Yes... But not when the new version is a few months away thag would probably fix all the issues I see posted on this site ever so often...starting with the Bluetooth issues. I got an S8... Because it's the only phone thay makes sense to me right now..... I'll see what Google is doing in the fall Max Johnson If the Moto G5 Plus had NFC I would have no problem making it my Android daily driver for the next 6 months. wade_county Moto Z Play and OP3/OP3T are other options with NFC. shadowx360 I used to buy 1 generation old Nexus devices to get around the cost issue, but it seems the 5X and 6P both are plagued by serious phone-killing issues. Now that warranty is up on nearly every used 5X/6P, buying used is like trying to navigate a minefield. I don't really trust 1st generation Pixel to not have serious issues either. I'd never use a non-Pixel/Nexus device but I can't buy a Pixel XL knowing Samsung offers so much better hardware at a similar price. wade_county My advice is getting the next OnePlus phone or picking up a used OP3/OP3T. AndrewGM I bought a used Pixel in good shape on eBay, as I couldn't get one from Google Store (already had a wireless provider). Switched from an iPhone 6s, after using almost every iPhone model since and including the original. Much better camera on the Pixel, especially closeups and in low light, and much easier to use overall (especially Contacts vs. iOS), as I've used mostly Google apps for a long time. I like the Google keyboard much better and the Android interface. I'm definitely satisfied with the Pixel and have no real iPhone regrets. It's true there are more apps for the iPhone, but that doesn't matter because the core apps are available on Android too. The only app I miss is Enlight, for photo editing. The one Pixel issue I agree with is the relatively poor resale value vs. iPhones (I assume). Carson Saldanha May I suggest Snapseed for photo editing? (It's developed by Google) Also, do you miss iMessage/FaceTime or is that really a con? AndrewGM Will check out Snapseed, thanks. I've been using Google Photos to lightly edit pics. The Pixel camera is so good that I often don't edit (for Instagram/FB uploads), especially if the light and composition are already good. I don't miss iMessage at all. I had to turn it off and all that stuff for my phone number when I switched, but I'm texting away every day. Emoticons seem to work fine. I don't even think about iMessage. FaceTime has been replaced with Duo for my family members, including those on iPhone. Seems to work fine. And I can share location with family members via Google Maps. I guess that brings up privacy issues vs. using Apple products, but not sure it makes a real-world difference. Battery life, btw, seems pretty good (I charge the phone overnight only). The call quality is a little less than iPhone, maybe, but overall acceptable. AndrewGM Will add that I have had the Pixel for 2 months and use it daily. I like the screen on the Pixel (or at least it never bothers me), and the issue about the "chin" at the bottom being big is a non-issue to me. I don't notice it and in fact hold the phone sometimes there, which is arguably convenient. If the phone continues to hold up, I'll be a customer for Pixel 2 eventually. Eric I was ready to jump to the Pixel XL after returning my second Note 7, but Google never gave me the opportunity to give them my money. Carson Saldanha xD My name is…. It was never a good device. thank you for finally admitting that. Andrew I don't think that's what the author is saying... My name is…. Someone had to be crazy to buy a pixel in the first place. I was bashing on that device from day one. Author, months later, says that the phone is no good. It was never good. Carson Saldanha Lord, would you just chill? Tr3ple I think he's retarded, gotta be it, lol. Must be it actually. Carson Saldanha troll by far Suicide_Note Except that's not at all what the author said, so you're either: A) trolling, B) incredibly dumb, or C) both of the above. Тарас Мукин Of course there's no point in buying Pixel for full price now. And there's more: there's no point in buying any device for it's starting price when it's 3 months old — tech gets old really fast today. And that's the whole point of not buying something at day one — everything gets much cheaper very fast. Samsungs do, LGs too. But Pixel for some reason didn't. And Nexuses were like this too. So — only buying Google devices right after release makes sense. Or buying them unofficially and cheaper. Sad, but true. sraj49 I always like and respect your articles. You put your views straight forward. But I tend not to agree with the tone and content of this article completely. I am living in Home of full Apple products and I own a Pixel XL. I love the Pixel in all aspects. Yes there are room to improvements which is true for everyone. Apple products are well designed, well built. As regards sorry gone are those days when Apple sorry was at is best which was until iPhone 4s/ iPhone 5. Now after the warmth period it is the same as Pixel. I going Pixel after sales support very good. I definitely agree with you on the most inefficient handling of supplies and also this is not the time to buy since meet models are coming. Just to add, I get sick when people say that the Pixel phones are not made by Google but by HTC. Everyone outsources manufacturing. Most of the phone are made by Foxcon staying from Apple. All phone manufacturers only design the hardware, software and the manufacturing is outsourced. Good_Ole_Pinocchio The HTC point that keeps coming up comes from the fact that Google didn't really dsign much hardware hete. They just used HTC parts. It's not the same as hardware being designed by apple then manufactureres elsewhere. andy_o I think he's right on that point. Google support may or may not be good, but it's online only. Apple support is famously good. For instance, the recent fixes for iPhone 6s battery problems. I booked an appointment, went into the store, they told me it would be a bit, went to a coffee shop, they emailed me, picked it up. Another time my iPad mini 2 mute switch broke. Again, appointment, go in the store, got it actually just exchanged on the spot. Google simply cannot do that. JohnyNoLegs What android phones have you owned prior to the pixel? And yes it's a HTC phone through and through. Scofabear Shots fired! I even dumped my 6P for a Moto z play. No regrets Futbolrunner Same here! That 808 was a lag fest. I even got the S8+ but returning it because it can't touch the Play's battery life. Dominic D I just bought a Pixel a month ago. I still would recommend it if you get one for fairly cheaply on swappa. It's awesome. Brian Demodulated My last 3 phones have been Nexus. Each has been less reliable than the last. I love how hackable they are but I think my next phone will be a Samsung Galaxy. Carson Saldanha Elaborate? Wdym by "less reliable" What issues? Brian Demodulated My Samsung Galaxy Nexus was incredible and still works today. My Nexus 5 was garbage - two broke within 1.5 years. My 6P is quirky - it doesn't charge on my home PC and although my wife's updated to 7.1.2 mine says it's up to date at 7.1.1. Tr3ple Get a pixel then, Samsung lol. Brian Demodulated I have my 6P another year. I'll see what's available next year when my contract is up. JohnyNoLegs Bootloops, dodgy updates, requires factory resets, breaks features, slow bug fixes. M. Luciano No offense, but you are not going to increase stability by going to Samsung. Brian Demodulated My old Samsung Galaxy Nexus was the best, highest quality, most reliable phone I ever owned. LG and Huawei's Nexus phones were less stable for me. M. Luciano I had a few of those.. they weren't as reliable. But probably because I did bad things to them. Brian Demodulated I rooted mine, loaded hacky ROMs, and carried it with me everywhere I went for 3 years. The USB and audio cables are a little loose now but otherwise it's saved me when my later Nexus phones crapped out on me. Vitali Galaxy nexus had clean stock rom, it is just Google's clean soft in a Samsung physical device and not with samsung's os Brian Demodulated Every Nexus has the clean stock ROM. It's one of the top reasons why I get them. JohnyNoLegs Going Pixel sure doesn't increase stability. It's less stable than my Note 4/Note 7. Vitali Agree with M. Luciano, but people try should move to Sony. Lookup at speed test videos of their Xperia XZs, it has beaten all smartphones by now, including the Pixel. All the biased big reviewers out there will never tell you the truth, stop thinking the S8 is the best phone in the world.. I recommend you to wait for their Xperia XZ Premium it will have sd835! After you see the XZs speed, I promise you it may be the fastest phone even in 2018. Suicide_Note No. Just...no. Vitali *A wild 8 year old fanboy comment appears* Brian Demodulated Speed isn't that important to me. I've heard bad things about Sony's flavour of Android and that it's bloaty. Vitali So you heard wrong, their software is one of the bests out there, and im talking from experience.. And Samsung have so clean and fast Android that it is just unbelievable.. Where do you get all that info from?? Vitali So you heard wrong, their software is one of the bests out there, and im talking from experience.. And Samsung have so clean and fast Android that it is just unbelievable.. "I've heard.." Where do you get all that info from?? Suicide_Note TW is much better than it used to be, but it's hardly clean and fast. Brian Demodulated I work in a large IT department. One of my buddies told me about it. He said Sony's Android UI was all over the place and annoying to use, and that his handset was 2 major versions behind the latest version of Android OS. dtox Lol don't listen to him, xperia phones are absolute trash. dtox LOL xperia = garbage D13H4RD2L1V3 Um, I'm not entirely sure. Not that I'm ragging Sony, but they haven't exactly been selling for a reason. Even Sony themselves know. I don't hate Sony phones. I personally think they're understated, solid offerings. Problem was that they were really overpriced. After seeing the XZs and XA1, seems like their pricing may have become more logical. We'll see how it goes. I'm personally hoping the XZP may even be a solid device. Not that I'll buy one but if the price is right, it'll be significantly easier to recommend. JSo Experiences differ from person to person. But It's odd the luck you have had with the Nexus devices. I've had the Galaxy Nexus, Nexus 5 and now the Nexus 5X and I have never had an issue with any of them. JohnyNoLegs No battery issues with 5X? My wifes upgraded to 7.1.1 and has never been the same, bluetooth is slow and laggy, and the battery barely gets 1.5-2 hours SOT after it used to get close to 3. Michael Hannigan Dude, you're talking about a crusty old obsolete phone. And unless you are happy getting 2 hours of battery time, you should pry the wallet open and buy something current. Complaining about your old phone won't make you feel better. Replacing it with a working, current phone that's not past it's expected useful life will. JohnyNoLegs Dude, wth are you talking about. It's a 1.5 years old. From new it was getting 4-5, right up until 7.1.1 update. Roy My 6P is the most reliable phone ever. And I had Samsung and HTC. Duder12 The last Nexus phones had bum processors from qc. royrov My Nexus 6P kissed the asphalt a couple of weeks ago, so I bought a perfect Pixel XL second hand (used 3-4 months). Its better, no regrets here. Faster and better battery, hell even snapchat is snappy on it! Tr3ple Exaclty lol, people saying the pixel isn't an upgrade to the 6p are delusional lol. They all like to hate on it u til they get one and realize how good of a phone it is. And all the bugs I've been seeing on the net are nowhere to be found and I had mine for 5-6 months now bekifft I know it's an upgrade. It's just not much of an upgrade for an enormous amount of money. Tr3ple My 6p had serious issues, I went and got a s7 egde(big mistake), the price I paid was well worth it. I'm still financing my s7 egde while I'm using a pixel, this is how much I love this phone. destinyhud I will still buy one Michael Tran If I could give you a phone for free but you had to keep it and use it and couldn't sell it. Which phone would it be? M. Luciano 128 GB Pixel XL, black supersanborn My 128GB Pixel XL in black. At least until the 2 comes and **hopefully** adds waterproofing, 600Mhz support, 4x4MIMO for T-Mobile. If you're reading, Pixel team, let's talk! Orlando aka Pixel XL Samsung Galaxy S8+ blue Tr3ple Gimme a 128 gb pixel XL black any day keithzg The bezels really are due for a shrink. Boy are you gonna rue this when the second-gen comes out and the bezels are the exact same ;) M. Luciano I sorta hope they are :) keithzg You animal! (But honestly, this is why choice is good. I find the desire for those top and bottom bezels incomprehensible, but I can entirely understand that not everyone would feel the way I do, particularly if routinely holding phones very differently.) M. Luciano I just want SOME bezels. They don't need to be huge. Just want a place to put my thumbs when holding it sideways. It's a good place for speakers IMO. Carson Saldanha Nah, to be fair, I think Google's definitely not planning on keeping them the same size if they've listened to the reviews. keithzg I mean, if they'd listened to reviews of many other phones before they put out the Pixels they would have known that too---including, for instance, the previous two generations of Nexus phones . . . So it seems likely that either (a) they know of the opinions of the commentariat and disagree, or (b) they felt technically they couldn't do it. I'm personally hoping it was somehow just (b) but they used (a) to convince themselves that it was an okay sacrifice, but that they won't have to make the same sacrifice again this year and they'll allow themselves to change up the design. But I'm not gonna bet too much money on that. Carson Saldanha Whoa, you lost be there with all those "a's" and "b's" xD Shawn Spring I think its pretty well known at this point that the time frame between when Google's negotiations w/Huawei fell through and when they picked the deal up with HTC was the cause of the "let's use the leftover A9 shells" bezel issue. So more (b) than (a) assuredly. ikeofkc If they do. Peoples' thumb muscles are going to be screwed if they use the pixel 1 handed, constantly trying to reach the back button. The chin makes one handed use possible keithzg See, that's what I mean about different folks and different strokes. I've never noticed it being of any help with my Nexus 6P, for me the top and bottom bezels are completely useless. bekifft If they actually put something useful there, like a front facing stereo speaker, I would be totally fine with that. keithzg Dammit, don't you go making me miss the Nexus 6 again! Michael Hannigan I want them to be bigger. I want to be able to lean on mine when I am standing in line at a movie. MadMartigan I am constantly amazed by the short memories. The author thinks it likely they are likely to have a better launch of P2? They do give the obvious impression that they believe the Pixel to be their first swing and a miss... Funny how quickly we forget, well, nearly every other device Google has ever tried to sell. I personally loved my 4, 10, 5, 6, and 6. But I cannot, while keeping a straight face, argue that one should expect anything better from them regarding inventory management this time around. How many times does Google have to fail on inventory management before we start pointing and laughing at the people who constantly say, "They'll get it right this time, for sure." Don't get me wrong - I would absolutely love it if Google proved me wrong on the P2. I just won't believe it until I see it. //dons flameproof suit// A'ight, I'm ready. Fire away... M. Luciano This is their first swing and a miss, but only because the shortages are for very different reasons than prior devices they sold on behalf of other OEM's. MadMartigan Who...who do you think made the Pixels? M. Luciano Google is the OEM for the Pixel phones (and tablets, and laptops, etc). HTC is the factory putting the phones together. It's a totally different legal and business agreement, and essentially means that Google has to supply most of the components, contracts, contacts, etc. and HTC is essentially an assembly line. On Nexus phones, the OEM was Samsung, or LG or Huawei, etc. and they actually designed and produced the phones, in partnership with and input from Google. Completely different. For those, the partner was able to do all the contracting and sourcing; HTC isn't doing all the work for Google this time. MadMartigan So you don't believe HTC designed the Pixel. Got it. That's all I needed to see. M. Luciano Not sure what that means, but ok. Google is now the OEM, that's what I am saying. Another Scott Nice post. I hemmed and hawed about a Pixel XL 128 for 6 weeks last fall and finally decided I just couldn't do it. Besides the fact that it was impossible to get from Google, I just couldn't justify the price. I decided to finally replace my LG Nexus 4 (roughly $350 new) with a new T-Mobile LG V10 from B&H in November for $330 and am quite pleased. (It would have been $300 a week or so later.) I added a Samsung EVO 128 GB SDHC card for it for $40 or so. I miss the Nexus timely updates a great deal, but I can't see spending a kilobuck on a phone to get it - especially for only a 2 year OS upgrade availability. I hope Google gets the Pixel 2 right, but maybe they figure having a "premium" phone for evangelists is good enough so they won't feel any pressure to make it available (or cut the price). Cheers, Scott. fijisiv The Galaxy S8+ is $20 less than a 128GB Pixel XL Just wow. M. Luciano Right? The Pixel is by far a better value at those prices. 128 GB storage over 16, metal over glass body, better software, better security, better camera, guaranteed to be up to date for 3 years... Samsung has some great components, but as a package, Pixel seems to keep ahead at this point. Matt I believe the S8+ is 64G and has a microSD slot. M. Luciano I think you're right. IMO that makes the Pixel better. Do you prefer less with expandable option? 03grunt I live in the mountains of NC and went back to Verizon once they brought back unlimited data and luckily the local Verizon store had a Pixel XL. I think it's pretty sad that in ~ 18 months the Pixel will be EOL. M. Luciano Luckily, it won't be. Nexus and Pixel devices are guaranteed to be fully up to date for 3 years; not 2. 2 years of major updates and 3 years of security updates = 3 years of being fully up to date. Sir_Brizz That's not entirely true. They are only guaranteed to be on the latest version for 2 years. It's unlikely it will be any different than the Nexus 6 in this regard (which didn't get 7.1 but is still getting monthly security updates). M. Luciano The Pixel and Pixel XL released October 4, 2016. They're guaranteed to be fully up to date until 10/31/2019. That's 1121 days, or 3.07 years. Sir_Brizz No. You are wrong. They are only guaranteed version updates until October 2018. The Nexus 6 was guaranteed the same thing until October 2016. It did not get Android 7.1 even though it continues to get monthly security updates. What this means is that the Pixel will get at least Android 9.0 but that doesn't guarantee it will get 9.1 or 9.2 or anything else past that. It just means it will get 9.0 and monthly security updates to 9.0 for an additional year. M. Luciano I get what you're saying, but it also launches on the latest update. So using the Pixel, it launches with N, will get O after a year, will get P after a year and then is not guaranteed to get Q. Are we really going to get a Q? So during each of those three updates, N, O and P, it on the latest OS and getting monthly security updates. 2 years of updates, so long as it includes the 2nd major OS update, translates to three full years. Ever since they started the annual number and letter update, we're essentially talking about a single API version update per year (2016 had 2, including the one you're referencing which impacted Shamu). Sir_Brizz I've already pointed this out twice: look at the Nexus 6 for a first hand example of how this is going to work. The Nexus 6 will not be on the latest version of Android for three years because it is already not on the latest version of Android despite getting monthly security updates. 03grunt Thanks for clarifying! Chris Kiederer As a Nexus 5X/project Fi user, right now the Pixel is my only choice if my Nexus decides to blow up like many before it. I really hope this Android one rumor heading to the US is true, as it would give project Fi subscribers more than just a really expensive option to stay on the plan Andye82 But exactly one year from today it will be still extremely difficult if not impossible to get your hands on pixel 2 Mix "Persistent stock issues have plagued Google's first "in-house" handset from day one..." I am on my 3rd phone and I still wonder, every time I use it, if it will be like my last two phones. I have phone PTSD! Google should just pull a Nintendo and just stop producing and move on to the 2 but not fuck it up. John Doe Great job on the article, now I will be waiting for the editorial on Google's software update policy LoL PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Google's inexperience producing a smartphone They had great experience running Motorola. Ammar "Sure, Google got some things astoundingly right: the performance, the camera, the larger software experience" To be honest, these are the only reasons why I'd ever get a Pixel over any other Android phone. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ I agree with some of Radar's points as well as teh main one as I've *never* recommended the XL because I know that the vast majority of people are sheep-like followers and/or technophobes, and I defifnitely don't want part of the onus for a technophobe's major purchase that they're going to rue the second that an iPhoner mocks them. The Pixel sells itself to PowerUsers on its own merit, which, AEB the popularity of inferior and/or questionable top-sellers, clearly supports my previous assertions. JPLoureiro Deciphering of your sentences will commence............. now. Futbolrunner What? Marty I never was going to buy an HTC Pixel. Don't like HTC and the build quality doesn't deserve such a high price. jawsnnn My SOs Pixel is probably the buggiest Google phone I have used till date. The Google Assistant, voice search are consistently broken and the phone doesn't offer much else in way of justifying it's price. Will definitely buy an OEM phone next. Google's hardware experiment is dead for me. Tim Harman I wish I'd read this 2 weeks ago! Oh well. I've got a Pixel now and I do love it. I live in NZ and the version I ended up with is the American one, which means that while it supports all my LTE bands, it doesn't support Carrier Aggregation on the bands used here. So that's my excuse for why I simply MUST HAVE the P2 when it's released. Damian Stuart Wow, what a load of crap! The Pixel is a superb phone with issues affecting small numbers of devices. I have one, after moving away from the Samsung range. I have had no issues and as I don't ever intend to take a phone swimming haven't got a single complaint about it. But haters gonna hate. sebastianer @David Ruddock Don't forget the terrible compass. If you grab an iPhone 5S and a Pixel. Open Google Maps in both of them. An you start walking trough dense downtowns the whole day (closing / opening maps at different places). You will see that the Pixel compass accuracy is constantly changing every time you open maps and is a total mess while the 5S is perfectly accurate after 1-2 seconds and less than one step. I hope the next Pixel has a completely new sensor...or compass or whatever. Last 3-4 Google Phones were a mess. I think the last Google phone with more or less good compass was the galaxy nexus but I can't even remember now TechGuy22 i'm selling mine soon since i know i can sell it around 600 dollars and it's the 128GB wjrandon So glad I kept my Nexus 6P for a second year... and look at those rock solid resale values. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9d5926ba5094521287d1d54e2476d3852462178bdf74a16166f94742b435213c.jpg TechGuy22 i sold mine for 500 dollars and i bought it used too lol that's how i managed to get the XL 128GB eric messenger It depends on what phone your coming from. For most android users it is a great phone with a great camera. If your coming from an iPhone the pixel is the first great alternative to an iphone. The on device support is actually awesome and they are very quick with support issues. I am used to Nexus devices plagued with serious issues that you had to work around and while they were great phones for the price I felt they all suffered (maybe not the 6P). Anyway the point is pixel raised the bar for Android and brought it up to par with Apple. It's probably still worth buying if you have to upgrade, and you can just get the pixel 3 in 2019 or 2020. Sean You can say this about any phone at the moment....wait for next gen. As a Project Fi user I am waiting on a phone that has the cell radio to take advantage of T-mobile's new 600mhz band they are quickly rolling out...and NO, it cant be done with a software update on any phone. me me "quickly rolling out"? The spectrum is sold but not available yet as the current user vacates.... Sean NOT TRUE....they are rolling it out in areas NOW where the old TV stations have already vacated the band. Google is your friend. me me finally, you realize it was crap, was always, still now, only thing now is you changed. Never worth the money, specs so-so for the price. Islam Google Pixel poor use of space. over-priced. BS Sean People that actually OWN one dont agree........ TechGuy22 i agree and i have one. sadly, it just stopped caring about the bezel since there's nothing i can do to make it look better VAVAMk_2 6P user here with a new battery happily waiting it out for Pixel 2. Sean Boot loop much? Ernie I have had my Nexus 6p since day one of the release. I have been lucky not to have encountered the boot loop or battery problems others have reported. I love my Nexus 6p. Hope it will get Android O. Phone_Addiction Pixel 2 probably going be the same story. Google will never learn. Dean F Marsh I love my Pixel XL! Invest in a good quality case and enjoy the phone. It's really pretty decent and for a few minor quirks mentioned, and none that I have experience yet, I can't be happier. From Nexus, HTC, Samsung, to Pixel XL, this has been the best so far. Ailín Ó’S I live in Ireland and Pixel isn't even available here yet which is odd given we were a launch country for Nexus 5x/6p but hey ho. Rick Schoonmaker This is just what I like to read after getting banged by Google and Huawei with the 6P bootloop issue 1 year and 2 days (read 2 days out of warranty) after buying and being told that my only option is to buy a new phone. So after being without a phone for a week, I had to buy a Pixel XL even though I really didn't want it and especially at the ridiculous price ($860 for 32Gb.. are you effing kidding?). Matt Definitely. I got a pixel XL the very first morning when it was available in local store. Great phone, camera, software. 2 months later, the phone began to behave crazily--extra hot, microphone malfunction. Called Google support for like 10 times and had it replaced, then I put the brand new replacement on local trade platform without hesitation. Google-brand is attatractive, but does not worth that rediculous amount of money. I can get a even better performed oneplus counterpart for almost half price. Anyway, I am on my moto x 2014 with lineage os 14 and i am pretty happy. It is sufficient for me to deal with my daily work. And I also suggest to wait for the release of more flagships from variant companies to have more flexible and reasonable options. Spinkick Google seems to not be able to follow through on anything these days. It just seems like if its not sexy or cool and needs actual work, they cant be bothered. Maybe they will release another chat app in the meantime.. 2 Men-E I want the Pixel 2 XXL (Taimen). It better exist as a 5.6"+ screened device. Philip Although if you're with TMobile. It's significantly cheaper to buy the Pixel, and get your money's worth. Granted the Pixel is guaranteed two years of support, it matches with TMobile promotion pay credit time. h4rr4r They offer a discount? I thought it was just financing. Philip Yep. $325 in TMobile bill credits over two years. Which is when the Pixel 3 will be out. So you buy a Pixel, get refunded about half of the cost. And then you're ready to upgrade to the third generation. belac77 shhh, David, I just listed my Pixel for sale on Swappa! ;) Mason Andrew Maseda This entire article is just terrible and written by someone just mad they don't have one. M. Luciano lol he got one the week after I did. He's had one. Adrianus Bratanata Supply and demand. As long as there is bigger demand than supply they don't need to reduce the price drunken_bastard I disagree. All the pros you mentioned for the Pixel -- pure Android experience, performence, camera, etc -- those are all the reasons why the Pixel and Pixel XL is still the best smartphone on the market. Worried a new one is going to come out? Happens with every flagship, every year. This one doesn't have the lastest SoC? I challenge you to demonstrate real world differences in actual speed versus the Galaxy S8, which is a gorgeous handset that yet again is crippled by bloated software and long standing issues that never seem to get addressed. You cite support potentially ending in October 2018 for software updates, but that's still a longer window than any other Android flagship, and you get them day one, which Samsung and LG don't. A smartphone is more than the sum of it's parts. It's an experience. I feel on that quality alone, the Pixel and Pixel XL are the best representations to date. NeMoDoSeZ I was going to buy a 128gb Pixel XL but due to not being available I ended up waiting and purchasing a Galaxy S8+. I'm now glad things ended up the way they did because I'm loving my S8+. Rod Until Android 8 is released. Then you'll like: fuck Samsung man! My U$xxx phone is outdated, goddamnit! Owen Iverson I hate the world of tech. We've now gotten used to NEEDING the latest thing IMMEDIATELY. Its why companies like Microsoft, Adobe, and Autodesk have switched to monthly/yearly subscriptions so you have to pay for the rest of your life. "The Bluetooth performance is horrid." What metric, speed? Connectivity? "It's not waterproof." Not sure that waterproof is a common trait among all high-end phones just yet. "The bezels really are due for a shrink." I've never used a bezel-less phone, where do you pick it up or hold it? Does your finger trigger anything on the edges? "The Snapdragon 821 is officially old news." What are you running where 1) you see lag and 2) that it's an actual problem. Maybe people are replacing consoles with their phones just like they're replacing their DSLRs with their phones? "it doesn't support proper advanced network features across all four of the big US carriers." What are these advanced network features? Anyway, I know it's a phone blog, so ... D13H4RD2L1V3 Well, he means that since its successor isn't far off, and that the Pixel is still not easy to get hold of, you might be better off waiting, since the Pixel is also selling at full price still. Edward jh How can the camera be great I mean what about the pixel camera lens flare issue plaguing 1000's of users. Margaritas Ante Porcos Pixel was a disaster. The worst phone for that price. I understand some of you got the Stockholm syndrome. But some of us see the clear picture. Google simply lost this round with both hands down. Dan Yurman My Google Pixel seems to have a mind of its owns. Here's what it does without my asking it - 1. shuts down randomly and has to be restarted by holding the power button and lower end of the volume rocker for about 15 seconds; 2. randomly starts different pieces of software including a suspiciously high frequency of instances of Google Play Music, which I have since disable, 3. Starts the flashlight from the pull down menu if the phone is placed face down on a shiny flat surface, 4 And randomly starts other programs after unlocking the phone with a pin. On the plus side the camera does good work and the phone is easily held in one hand and scrolled with fingers from the same hand while eating hit wings with the other. :-) Ray I'm very glad I read this article. I was on the fence - and almost pulled the trigger the other day but very glad I didn't now. I'll wait for the next gen and hopefully it's a much better piece of kit - and possibly cheaper. lomsha Whaaaat, you don't say. rockon999 My 2015 Moto X PE's display stopped functioning properly and I needed a new device to *function* in my daily life. So I bought a pixel, yesterday. To address your complaints... I never use Bluetooth on a phone, I'm getting a case, I'll hate the speakers (but I really only use headphones), I'm no bezel snob, and finally... waterproofing? My Moto X PE was waterproofed and I can honestly say it never aided me in one single way. Sure, it felt great using the phone in the rain that one time. But I'm fairly certain an encased pixel can survive that. I know it is probably a horrible value, but I really don't want to deal with buying a $200 phone now, selling it later for $100, and then buying a new $900 phone in a few months. I don't have time to constantly be reselling and selling my devices and I don't have a spare $100 to just throw around on a device. Slurms Mckenzie Seriously have been saying most of what this article is about since day one. I have a pixel XL and I've hated it since receiving it. It's not worth what Google asks when everything that is offered can be had for half the money (quick updates not included) for that asking price it should at least offer sd card support which is something even the most basic phones have. I've been using Nexus phones since the beginning (skipped the 6) and the problems with them were expected as it was a budget friendly phone but if you want to charge premium pricing don't use cloth for your ear piece cover, have dual speakers, and for God's sake don't make deals with the devil (Verizon) to lock down MIMO as a carrier specific feature when every damn phone is capable of and and most carriers are as well F*** you Pixel XL you sack of shit what a waste of 800 bucks Rod Best camera Google photos unlimited backup at original resolution Best performance Lowest touch latency of all Android phones "Just" that. micahthomas Basically all you're saying is wait if a new version is going to be released in 6 months. Might as well just say that, doesn't really have anything to do with if it's iPhone or Android. JG I was about to order my mother a 32GB Pixel a week or so ago to replace her Nexus 5X. I recently discovered the glass of its camera lens has a pretty decent crack in it. It doesn't seem to affect pictures - yet... But we're planning a fairly photogenic trip this summer and I figured the Pixel has a better camera and has unlimited free full resolution Google Photos uploads so... But as I was about to click the "Add to Cart" button, I thought we're not all that far from the expected October release of the Pixel 2. I'm sure mom wouldn't mind being a generation behind, but... derk p just replace the housing on hers. i bought a white one but then wanted a blue back... was cheap on ebay and is very easy to snap on and snap off dizel123 Relatively speaking we're not too far from October of next year for the Pixel 3. Or October 2019 for the Pixel 4... toast I never buy Apple, and I never buy Samsung. But both of their hardware just feel slicker than the Pixel. As the article says, knock a few hundred off the price, and I'd be a keen buyer, mainly for the camera and fast OS updates, and Google "Purity". I'll wait and see how the upcoming Moto Z and X phones turn out. Defenestratus It'll be difficult for me to go back to a Google phone after the nightmare that was my 6P. Major Sceptic Availability is no problem in my neck of the woods , and I appreciate the work Google did on the camera as a point and shoot and smooth software , but after looking at the pixels they looked a bit underwhelming in the feature department , and then as mentioned the outrageous​ prices for the pixels I wouldn't go near one . I might add with the smooth software , Google no longer has the Monopoly on as most devices with 7.0 onwards are very good . Rod What feature does it miss? redsoxwin I'm not sure what this person's agenda is, but this is great phone. Strange article. Amie Perry Porter I personally love my Pixel phone. Will Dutton I never cease to be amazed that everyone always thinks that 'the next one will fix it' with android John Quincy Adams Whining about bezels is ignorance. Without bezels, how do you hold it? . ..please, bezel whiners...answer this... gar216 I'm a happy Nexus 6p user. Even prior to launch I couldn't justify upgrading my 7 month old 6p to a Pixel XL. It would have clearly been an upgrade, but I didn't think it was enough of an upgrade for the price. Also... It's kinda ugly. SiliconAddic "The Google Pixel is a notoriously hard phone to get a hold of. Persistent stock issues have plagued Google's first "in-house" handset from day one, and things really are little to no better in the six months since the launch event. " Um BS. Google has ALWAYS his issues with distribution. The Nexus 5 had this issue, the Nexus 6 had this problem, the 6p also had this problem and now the pixel. Google is incompetent when it comes to this. Meanwhile Apple can launch a new phone and you can walk into any of their stores and pick one up. I wanted a Pixel to replace my Nexus 6, could not get one. I ended up with a S7 edge. Google and Nintendo should team up with their inability to ship jack ****. Eric How does this stand to affect the resale value / trade-in value for current pixel owners under project fi? I'm asking as someone who switched to project fi from Verizon prepaid in early January, and has almost been regretting it ever since. I am a quadriplegic in a power wheelchair to whom the pixel with Google Assistant seemed a natural front runner, due to its voice capabilities, and project fi with it's much touted multi Network and Wi-Fi hopping capabilities seemed a good decision as well. Did my due dilligence and the 4G network to all appearances covered me completely, even though I live with my elderly parents in a rural area. The only option available for order at the time was a white Pixel (not XL) and 32gb. I was nervous about the 32 part at the time, but felt comfortable with the infinite backup capability of Google photos. Now, 3 1/2 months later, not only is service spotty, audio crackly despite not being a candidate for replacement under the microphone bug, and Google's customer service... Let us politely say not the most helpful on the issue. I apologize about the length of this comment, (and after reading over it I really should have made it a direct message) but the difference between a phone worth $600 and the phone worth $300 in retail/tradein is quite a big deal to someone like me, and as much as I love my pixel (and admire/fear/respect Google) getting out while the getting is good is starting to sound the smarter move. ( especially after the 180 they made on the 5x.... Grrrrr) Was curious to get an educated opinion on the subject. Thanks again for your ( and anyone else's who has read this far) time and any insight offered! dizel123 Opinion: Even if you can, you probably shouldn't read David Ruddock's articles anymore. Adam Myself having been using the Pixel since day one, I would agree to an extent... Would I go out a purchase a brand new Pixel/Pixel XL for full retail? Of course not! Only because the new iteration is just around the corner. Now, would I go buy a Galaxy S8 or an iPhone 7? No way, wouldn't even consider it! I have switched phones at least every 6 months for the past 3 to 4 years, between Android and iOS operating systems as well... Having said that, the Pixel has been the best phone and best experience that I have had to date! This is the first time that I haven't thought about what phone I want to get next, and to be honest there would have to be significant improvements for me to even get the newest iteration when it comes out this fall. This phone as just been that good. To sum things up... I would not buy the Pixel/Pixel XL right now at full retail cost, I definitely would NOT go out and buy a Galaxy S8 or an iPhone either... If you, like myself, really love the Pixel line and want to get one and don't already own one. I would suggest trying to hold out and get the newest release this fall. It's most definitely worth the wait! D13H4RD2L1V3 Google always seems to have issues with stocking ever since the Nexus days. Pretty embarrassing that it's still hard to get a hold of one after 6 months. Probably due for a small price cut soon, as newer phones roll out. me me yeah I loved Nexus back with Nexus 4, 5, 7. Now the Nexus banner is carried by the likes of Moto G, OnePlus.... H2OSKI So true. The bluetooth issues alone nearly make this phone unusable. Drops and cutout's every 20 seconds. Get this, my Pixel was fine UNTIL Google sent out "the server side" update to fix the Bluetooth issues my phone never had!!! Thanks Google. Mine is going back this week. Great camera crap bluetooth. I take pics occasionally​ but I need to use a bluetooth headset hours a day. Multiple headphones, headsets, and vehicle connections with all the same result...even in safe mode. Fail. Daishi Google shot themselves in the foot when they gussied up an HTC 10 and called it a Pixel. It is just any other Android phone and doesn't have the support behind it to justify the price. Six months along, it should be more than 50% off. William Ross Why the hell is this idiot comparing a 6 month old device to the newer releases? A year in smartphone years is a lifetime. That being said, the pixel still has the best most up to date software bar none! The camera is still among the best if not the best. And, although the 835 is a newer processor, the 821 is no slouch. GTFOH with this garbage article. And, I'll definitely be getting the next Pixel regardless of price. And, I'll sell my original on eBay for a pretty penny. And, this baby has no scratches any where. It's always been in a case and all glass has been protected by Liquid Armor. diggie Pixel is a $650+ phone built like a budget chinese phone. And sorry, Oneplus has Google beat on OS features while keeping "stock" feel. William Ross Oh here we go again with the one plus fans always hating on the pixel. If your phone is so great then why knock the pixel? I just don't get it. Just talk about how great your actual Chinese knockoff is. No need to hate in the Pixel. The one plus has little more than a cult following and mock my words, it'll never be a mainstream device. me me Android Police and a lot of its customers are hating the Pixel. The OnePlus fans just chime in. I own a OP3T. It simply works, yep even Bluetooth. When take tax into account, its about half the price. OnePlus fans biggest concern: price creep upwards. $300 becomes $350 becomes $390 becomes.... Goblin Shark Is this article from April 1st? Absolutely no one with any knowledge of phone tech recommended a Pixel, ever! Underspeced and overpriced, I doubt there's any trouble keeping them in stock they just know nobody wants them so they're not making any. Rod Under-spec'ed? Ok Underperforming? Nope Edgar Morales I honestly don't see what the problem is I purchased my pixel XL and have not to date had any issues whatsoever with it no Bluetooth issues no speaker issues nothing everyone is saying Michael Hannigan Hey, if you get a phone you love and it lasts just under a year, that's good enough. What more do you expect for a few hundred bucks. Appreciate the year you loved that thing and then replace it with a new one that you can love even more. Tom Takumi Okamoto OnePlus is a better phone maker than Google. A company not even 1% worth of Google. I really want a Pixel but it's not practical. Ionut Lala I'm sorry but that is clearly not a first generation device. Not the first from Google (made by HTC and let's not forget about the Nexus line). And not the first from HTC (for obvious reasons). Aquan Belk I wish other Android manufacturers went to stock Android. I know Samsung shines in it's own apps on top of Android but vanilla Android still is and always will be the best. Rod You heard the man, people. Don't buy a Pixel because it will have bad resale value and won't be updated for long. Instead, get a model that will have bad resale value and won't be updated for long, plus has worst performance, buggy software and worse camera performance. You're welcome. Stephonz My last Google phone was Nexus 5. As much as I like pure Android experience, Google has a bigheaded trend in phones. The price point was my biggest no no after the 5X. They don't offer as much features as the other well known Android companies.. amir80 I have a Pixel 32 gb and I really really like it. Everything works great and the camera is amazing and also the battey life. For me, the fingerprint sensor is a must. The S8 sensor is poorly located and the G6 sensor is too small. GeorgeDao123 Absolutely. The Pixel duo are 2 pieces of $#!¶. They run pure Android version and they are so slow to boot up and open apps though they are lag-free. Neru Nexus I've had a pixel since launch day. For one I don't agree with the bluetooth issues. Keep the phone up to date or use the bluetooth connect and play app to automate things. Second it is a over priced phone but so is an iPhone. The main reason real users should get a pixel is the updates. Sure you might need to learn something about that expensive piece of tech you bought and not just sit on your hands waiting for the apples or googles of the world to update your shit, but at least google gave us source code, kernel code and a unlocked bootloader. There are still updates being made for the old nexus 5, that's like 5 years old. Grab iphone 4s and tell me again about how fucking great those updates are lol. You can't even install apps like skype or whatsapp that thing is pooched. I can promise the world that even if google stops updating the pixel in 2018 there will be updated versions of the os you can manually install for years. Let's see if you can get more then one firmware update on your fancy new samsung s8. My money is on 1, then the s9 will launch a year later and samsung just won't care about the s8. rjcuk What if you want a slightly smaller phone? The S8 is 5.8" compared to the Pixel at 5". I really struggle to hold 6" phones. Even the Nexus 5X at 5.2" was too big to grip properly and comfortably. Janoo Ramachandran DON'T BUY A PIXEL. We have 2 Pixels at home. One bought early November 16 and the other end Jan 17. The one I was gifted this January, within 40 days had microphone related issues. I could not hear anyone on the phone, nor was the music being played out. They refused a replacement. My phone sat in the repair centre for 8 plus day and the mother board replaced. Have you ever heard of a new phone device of any other brand needing a mother board replacement in leads than 45 days WELL GOOGLE PHONE PIXEL NEEDED IT. The other phone bought early November 16 started having other issues last month and it wasn't recognizing the wifi. After at least 20 hours on the phone with the terrible google support, it had to be sent to the repair centre where it was kept for 2 weeks, you heard that right 16 days to be precise. Then the phone came back with a chip replaced. SHOULD YOI BUY A PIXEL EVER. :. NEVER SHOULD YOU LOOK AT GOOGLE AS A PHONE MAKER :. NEVER Nikhil I wholeheartedly concur here. I picked up a Pixel sometime around December which had to be promptly returned for a replacement as the volume rocker was rickety. The replacement didn't last long either. Within a month, the widely acknowledged microphone issues popped up and after almost 15 days of talking to the very incompetent Google support in India, their only resolution was to take the Pixel to the service center. The service center did not have the motherboard in stock (they had to bring it all the way from Taiwan) and my phone still languishes there even after 15 days of me submitting it. The phone suffers from not only just Gen-one product issues, but also terrible after sales support. Leonardo Baez Agree.... ait for the next generation THEN buy current generation cheaper. Jeremy Allan Actual customer service? You do realize that owners of a pixel get free 24/7 support any time, on a dedicated line for pixel owners? Exalm There is the same section in the settings on Nexus 5X and 6P. No idea whether it works, since there's no chat or phone support in Russia neither for Nexus nor Pixel. Cory Wilson I agree. Granted it was around a year ago I bought my 6p but the 6p didn't cost $870 either. Still don't regret that decision Impulse_Vigil Haven't really had any serious Pixel Bluetooth issues here... A handful of times (literally less than half a dozen) BT shut itself off back in Feb-March, hasn't happened again since the Play Services patch. I use Bluetooth on a daily 24/7 basis too with my ZenWatch 3, car audio, etc. I don't push it to its range limits tho. Dunno whether David's usage and issue is some sorta edge case, or range related, or whether he was speaking to the 1-2 month period when others were having more severe Bluetooth shut off issues. I do agree with the overall sentiment tho, Google hasn't made it easy to buy the Pixel and that's simply inexcusable. I haven't had to suffer thru any of the QC issues (no BT, mic, whatever issues here, knock on wood) but it seems they weren't handled super well either. To be honest I wouldn't even recommend the S8 to anyone either unless it's another geek/enthusiast, these days for most people it's simply not worth it to spend that kind dosh on a phone. I bought my mother a Moto Z Play; I'd probably point others towards that, the OP3, or an HTC One/S7 on sale. I'm super happy with my Pixel, but if there was a OnePlus 3-class device for Zoglog Having owned a pixel XL and now a s8+, I'd have to agree. Even not taking into account the questionable hardware reliability of the pixel (mine died in 5 months). Basically when I owned the pixel I loved the hell out of stock Android but I kept on wondering why I paid so much for it. Meanwhile with the S8+ the gorgeous screen makes it feel especially special and worth the price. Even though I would prefer stock Android 10000% sebastianer Pixel is just another Nexus. Like the 6P. There is no excuse, this is not their first premium phone. Still made by HTC instead of Huawei. And called Pixel instead of Nexus...and more expensive because of HTC and all the marketing costs. And..still has the shitty compass all their recent previous nexus had with a lot of topics open in Google product forums and staff giving tons of manuals about how to perfect calibrate something that doesn't retain calibration. But the main reason I wouldn't buy a Pixel...is the compass and secondly that you will get one more android update if you wait 6 months. username_not_valid How is the pixel the first 'in-house Google phone'? Its clearly and actually a slightly rehashed HTC. HTC doesn't just make it ,they designed it for all intents and purposes. Unless Googles design strategy happens to be exactly like HTCs then its not a Google phone. The Pixel is just an over priced nexus, nothing else. SOUL- Always great to see the smartphone community go from praising a phone to outright basing it just after a couple of months. Perfectly fine with my Pixel. Michael Sørensen It's just ... really boring. andy mckenzie It's a superb phone , blazing fast so processor is not an issue , amazing camera , free storage , online support has been fast and efficient in my experience, stock Android , I'd highly recommend to anyone. remister I am still using my 6P, I couldn't swallow the 1K price tag for 128GB with insurance.... Justin Field Yeah, I broke the screen on my 5x, and since I am on Fi I considered getting a pixel for about 2 seconds and ordered and new screen and fixed my phone. I will wait for the next gen or switch off of Fi.

Whatever the reason, here's how to get your entire digital life from Android to iOS with as little head-scratching as possible. Image: Gizmodo For simplicity's sake, we'll assume you're set up on Android with your data plugged into Google's services (Gmail, Google Calendar and so on). If you're using something else, like a Microsoft or Yahoo email address, the process will be similar, and often just involves installing the relevant Android-analogous app on your new iPhone. We should also point out that a future Field Guide will talk about moving in the opposite direction, so watch this space for that. Apple's Move to iOS app Move to iOS has its merits... if you can get it to work. (Image: Screenshot) You can automate much of what we're about to talk about with Apple's official Move to iOS app for Android: it handles email, calendars, contacts, photos, videos (taken with the device), and even text message history. There are a couple of caveats to consider. One, you need to be setting up your iPhone from scratch, so it needs to be brand new or freshly reset, and two, it doesn't give you all that much control over the way everything gets switched. It also misses out some of the files and data we're going to cover below, and as you'll note in reviews of the app, it can be hit and miss on actually transferring texts. Moving texts SMS Backup+ can send your texts to Gmail. (Image: Screenshot) Moving SMSes is tricky — Move to iOS is in theory one of the cleanest options, as we've mentioned, but you need to be setting your iPhone up from scratch, and users report mixed results in transferring SMS history right into iOS Messages. We tried several times to get the app to work on our devices and had to give up as it refused to make a wireless connection, but your mileage may vary. Backing up an archive of your Android texts isn't too difficult: SMS Backup+ will send them all to Gmail for you, and SMS Backup & Restore can back them up to Google Drive or Dropbox too. A variety of third-party Windows and macOS apps promise to do the job for you as well, but we'd be wary of installing anything unofficial unless it's been around for a long time, is regular updated, and has a long list of positive user reviews. We can't vouch for the security or reliability of any of them, except for SMS Backup+, which we've been using without any problems for years, and SMS Backup & Restore, which comes from a very reputable software developer. Unless you can get Move to iOS to work better than we did, replicating an exact copy of your Android SMS history in Messages looks almost impossible — at best you can get some kind of archive exported for future reference. It's a different story with other instant messaging apps, which we'll come on to later. Moving emails If you want to keep your Google accounts active, they integrate neatly with iOS. (Image: Screenshot) If you want to take your Gmail account with you over to iOS, you've got two options: install the Gmail app for Apple devices, or add your Gmail account to the default Mail app on iOS. The first one is easier but the second helps you cut ties with Google more quickly. First, you need to prepare your Gmail account for the great export. Open the Settings tab on the web (click the cog icon then Settings), switch to the Forwarding and POP/IMAP section, and enable either POP for all emails or IMAP. Are you going to carry on using your Gmail account? Then use IMAP, which gives you two-way access to your Gmail inbox from Apple's Mail app. Do you just want to download your old Google messages and never look back? Go for POP, which will download all your emails. With that done, open up Settings in iOS, choose Mail, then tap Accounts and Add Account. Choose Google if you're taking the IMAP approach, then follow the instructions on screen to sign into your Gmail; choose Other if you're using POP, in which case you'll need these details to configure access. Moving contacts and calendars  iCloud can accept contacts but not calendars. (Image: Screenshot) You can move your Google (Android) contacts and calendars over to iOS very easily: open Settings on your iPhone, tap Contacts (or Calendar), then choose Accounts. Choose Add Account and Google, or pick the existing Google entry from the list, then log in with your Google credentials to get everything synced over. That then keeps your Google Contacts and Google Calendars in sync with the native Contacts and Calendar apps on iOS (and macOS) — but perhaps that's not what you want. If you'd rather forget the syncing aspect and just move your Google data over in a one-time operation, it's a bit more involved and needs a manual export and import: it's messier, but it does mean you can get everything natively inside Apple's apps and leave Google behind. First you export your Google contacts to a .vcf file from the Contacts app on Android (in Settings on the app menu) or via Google Contacts on the web. Select all your contacts then pick More to find the Export link. That .vcf file can then be imported through iCloud on the web or emailed to your iPhone — once you tap on the attachment, you'll be asked if you want to import the contacts. It's a similar process with Google Calendar. Here you need to visit the web interface, then export your schedules by clicking the cog icon, Settings, Calendars and Export Calendars. The files you've created can't be imported into iCloud though — you need to add them in the Calendar app in macOS to sync them to an iPhone via iCloud. If you don't have a macOS machine on hand, you're pretty much stuck with entering your birthdays and appointments all over again, unless you're happy with just using Google Calendar for iOS or trying Move to iOS for Android with the caveats we mentioned earlier. Moving photos and videos Google Photos is the most obvious option for photos and videos. (Image: Screenshot) This can be incredibly straightforward or rather messy depending on how you want to do it and where your photos and videos are stored. Assuming you're taking advantage of Google Photos, the native photo manager for (stock) Android, you can simply install the iOS version to get at your whole library pictures and movies (and to upload anything you take on your new iPhone). You go to Settings then Back up & sync and Back up device folders to make sure you've got absolutely everything copied off your phone and up to the cloud. Even if you're abandoning Google services completely, this option will show you all the different folders on your Android device where pictures are stored. If you want to get everything moved, pixel-by-pixel, from Google Photos to Apple's iCloud Photo Library, more effort is required: we've actually done a complete guide to this in the past. Refer to that article for full details, but in summary you need to use Google Drive or Google Takeout to get hard copies of your photos and videos downloaded to a macOS or Windows machine. From there you can import them into Photos for macOS, iTunes on Windows, or iCloud on the web, and from there over to an iPhone. If you don't use Google Photos, you need some other method for getting all your Android photos and videos to a computer, and from there to Apple Photos and iCloud. Dropbox will do it, for example, or you can use the tried and trusted USB cable method. Just be sure that you've harvested all the files from all your apps — apps like Twitter and WhatsApp save photos in a different location to the main gallery, for example. Moving music and movies Importing files to iTunes is one way to get them on iOS. Image: Screenshot Android being Android, you might have your music and movies on your phone in all kinds of ways: Netflix, Plex, Google Play Movies & TV, and so on. Just about any video or music app you have installed on Android will be on iOS as well, including those we just mentioned — a lot of the time there are no files to transfer, just logins to manage. Any local files you've got queued up on Android should work just fine on iOS too. You don't have to use Apple's own music and video apps if you don't want, but if you do then you need to get your local files off your Android device and into iTunes with the help of a macOS or Windows machine. Presumably a lot of the files on your Android device were synced from a computer in the first place, but if not they can be transferred via USB or an app like Dropbox, as with your personal photos and videos. Then from iTunes, choose File and Add to Library (macOS) or Add File to Library (Windows) to import the media. If you run into file format problems we'd recommend using Handbrake to solve them. If you're heavily invested in purchases from Google Play Movies & TV, there is an iOS version. Image: Screenshot iOS is more restrictive when it comes to syncing music and movies to your phone, and if you don't want to go through iTunes, you need to use an app that can pull files straight from the cloud or over a Wi-Fi network rather than relying on local storage: the likes of Plex, Spotify and VLC will all do the job. If you aren't cutting the Google cord completely, Google Drive is another good option for watching video on iOS without having to actually transfer any files, because you can stream files straight from the cloud. It's when you're switching between mobile OSes that these device-agnostic apps and platforms really come into their own. In short, you've got plenty of choices for apps that will play your local, unrestricted, DRM-free music and movie files on iOS, while any digital library app you've been using on Android will have an equivalent on iOS, so there's no real problem there either. Moving apps and games You can't easily transfer WhatsApp chats, though you can email them to yourself. (Image: Screenshot) There's no way around the fact that you need to get all your Android apps installed again on iOS, and pay twice in some cases. Though subscription services like Netflix and Spotify just switch straight over (moving between devices is another good reason to live your digital life in the cloud). Most social media and messaging apps will take everything from Android to iOS for you, though there are exceptions, with WhatsApp being one of the big ones. Unfortunately, WhatsApp's own backup and restore function only works when you're going from Android-to-Android or iPhone-to-iPhone. As with text messages, various third-party options are available, but we can't vouch for any in particular. If you're happy just having a record of your WhatsApp chats and are ready to start afresh on iPhone, you can email them to yourself. From the WhatsApp Settings screen, tap Chats, then Chat history, and Email chat: you can then pick your conversations one by one and email yourself a copy, with or without attached media. Boom Beach is one game where you can link devices. (Image: Screenshot) We can't go through every messaging app in detail here but obviously your switch is going to be easier with those apps that store everything in the cloud (hello Google Hangouts). Virtually every instant messenger on Android has an iOS equivalent so it's a question of exploring the import and export options — you may just have to start again with a blank message history on iOS. Another area where you might have trouble is with your saved games and high scores: not only will you need to pay for all your games again, you're probably going to lose your progress too. Some apps, like Subway Surfers (with Facebook) and Boom Beach (with a code), will let you transfer progress and scores between devices, but again you'll have to do the research every game you own to be sure. If you can't find the answers you're looking for out on the web then contact the developer directly and see if there's any way for getting your saved games from one platform to the other. The same goes for other types of app if you can't see an obvious way of moving data between Android and iOS installs. Moving yet more files and data Use a file explorer to look for data you've missed. Image: Screenshot We're not quite done yet! You might want to be as comprehensive as possible in your data switchover — think about any documents or spreadsheets you've got stored on your Android device. Most productivity apps will store these in the cloud, so getting at them from iOS should be simple, but it's wise to double-check. The vast majority of Android apps can be found on iOS, with the only exceptions being advanced customisation tools such as Tasker or the Android launchers, which you're just going to have to live without in iPhone-land. Other apps should have iPhone equivalents and some kind of mechanism for switching files over — if you're worried about something getting left behind, use a file manager like Solid Explorer for a deeper look. One of the folders to check is the Downloads folder, which brings us to our final section. Web Browsing If you've got Chrome on Android syncing everything like passwords and bookmarks back to the cloud, you can simply install Chrome on iOS and get on with your life, but if you're determined to use Safari on your new iPhone then you need to jump through a few more hoops. Chrome for iOS will take all your passwords and browsing history with you. Image: Screenshot The aforementioned Move to iOS is one option for your web bookmarks, or you can set up synced versions of Chrome and Safari on macOS and use the respective export and import tools to get everything moved over (and from there to your iPhone). If neither of those options appeal, you're going to have to start from scratch, and the same goes for stored passwords and browsing history (you can at least access your saved Chrome passwords from this page on the web to ease the process of switching over). These elements are just too deeply integrated into Chrome to get them easily over to Safari, so embrace the chance to start afresh. It may not be possible, but ideally you want to keep your Android and iOS devices running alongside each other for a while: it makes it easier to check up on gaps in your transferred data, like browsing history, and helps you spot anything you might have missed (such as a PDF file that's fallen through the cracks). Comments Dr_Stef Guest May 2, 2017, 10:30am What about the other way round? I love the look of that new S8, plus Apple isn't really doing it for me anymore Reply 4 Daaaaamm,I'mLookin'Good @skinja May 2, 2017, 11:38am just google it. as far as i know, when you set up newer samsung phones now there is software built in to tell it you are transferring over from ios. dont quote me on that, but its definitely easier to go from apple to android then it is to go from android over to apple (only God knows why you would do that) Reply 3 soldant @soldant May 2, 2017, 2:12pm They've done loads of articles on this before. Reply 0 Almost Guest May 2, 2017, 12:37pm Given the progress in mobile phones means that the differences between them in functionality these days is more or less moot I tend towards ownership and control of my own data. Which is why I'm using Android. I wonder if it'll mimic the PC history where Apple was clearly better and then everyone else caught up and then charged 75% less. Reply 1 On the other hand . . . Guest May 2, 2017, 1:32pm "I tend towards ownership and control of my own data. Which is why I'm using Android." You are free to chose any device you like and it is of no consequence to me which device or eco-system you prefer, but if this is your rationale then I just cannot stop laughing. Reply -2 boxhead72 Guest May 2, 2017, 3:36pm Actually we are all laughing at your comment.. not needed fanboy. Reply 0 pformagg @pformagg May 2, 2017, 1:44pm Until iOS has KODI on it, I won't even consider. Reply 0 jake_d @jake_d May 2, 2017, 2:34pm Or maybe you've reverse aged, and are now a teenager again. Reply 0 igod @igod May 2, 2017, 2:35pm iOS is a miserable POS. Not sure why anyone would want to to go back to 2009 tech. Reply 0 hamish77 @hamish77 May 2, 2017, 3:18pm Does everything I need it to. Doesn't have malware, self installing coin slot icons, no spam messages from downloading filthy apps, clean UI, compatibility with everything in my house being apple products....... Seriously though, unless you actually own all apple devices and have that interconnectivity between them, you really have no idea what you're talking about. Reply 0 boxhead72 Guest May 2, 2017, 3:42pm Actually he does. iOS does have malware, what are self installing coin slot icons, never heard of that, no spam messages etc. If you are stupid enough to download from unknown untrusted sources then you are to blame. Unless you are open to using your own brain and not being a sheep then you really have no idea what you are talking about. Reply 0 domainman Guest May 2, 2017, 4:07pm That first point is a lie that Apple keeps pushing with their propaganda machine. Their marketing is just that good. Every OS has malware. Windows, Apple, Linux... they all do. It's just a matter of how it gets executed on your device. A lot of things these days are through social engineering, so it doesn't matter which platform you're on. Yes, there is a lower chance of you installing something suspect through iTunes store compared to the Play Store, but in no way is iOS malware-free. Reply 0 hamish77 @hamish77 May 2, 2017, 4:32pm lower chance? lol. Never had a single issue, not one, on any of my multiple apple devices or 2 imacs and none of it has any virus protection whatsoever for five years now. So whilst I know it's not impossible, it's VERY unlikely. Can't say the same for my GS5 (work phone) or 2 PC's at home. Reply 0 Zeugma Guest May 2, 2017, 4:06pm Why.. Why would you! Why would you want to move from a proper operating system that lets you do what YOU want, and do actual real work, to a child's operation system in which nanny Apple tell you what you can or can't do.

By The Baltic Review - May 1, 2017 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter tweet Lithuanian scammer accused of single-handedly swindling Google & Facebook out of $100 million The United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York announced criminal charges against Lithuanian Evaldas Rimašaukas. The cyber-crime was described as a fraudulent business email compromise scheme that tricked two sophisticated U.S.-based internet companies to wire over $100 million to Rimašaukas’ bank accounts in Latvia, Cyprus, Slovakia, Lithuania, Hungary, and Hong Kong. According to an indictment released by the US Justice Department last month, 48-year-old Evaldas Rimasauskas from Vilnius began contacting the accounting departments of the two companies in 2013 using convincing fake email addresses and letterheads impersonating Quanta Computer, a large Taiwanese tech parts supplier used by both Google and Facebook, which were referred to only as Company-1 and Company-2. Using “forged invoices, contracts, and letters,” Rimasauskas persuaded the companies’ employees to wire millions of dollars intended for real purchases, to impostor accounts actually owned by him. He then stashed the massive sums in banks all over Eastern Europe. It is unclear how soon the victims noticed they were missing millions of dollars or when they alerted the authorities, but according to American investigators, Rimasauskas was able to get away with the scam until 2015. Both Google and Facebook say that investigators were able to trace the money, and most of it has been returned. “We detected this fraud against our vendor management team and promptly alerted the authorities. We recouped the funds and we’re pleased this matter is resolved,” said Google in a statement. Facebook said it had “recovered the bulk of the funds shortly after the incident and has been cooperating with law enforcement in its investigation.” Despite the first sealed indictment coming against Rimasauskas last December, he was only arrested in Lithuania this month. He is now facing wire fraud, money laundering, and identity theft charges that could land him in prison for decades. The accused insists he is innocent and vows to fight extradition to the US. The FBI collaborated with Google, Facebook, their banks, the Prosecutor General’s Office, and other law enforcement agencies in the Republic of Lithuania to trace the footprints of Rimašaukas’ phishing attacks and make the arrest at his home in Vilnius. Rimašaukas was indicted by the U.S. Justice Department Office’s Complex Frauds and Cybercrime Unit for identity theft, money laundering, and wire fraud. Federal sentencing guidelines state that conviction for such offenses carries a statutory maximum term of imprisonment of 24 years. Acting U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Joon H. Kim, said in a Justice Department announcement, “This case should serve as a wake-up call to all companies – even the most sophisticated – that they too can be victims of phishing attacks by cyber criminals.” Rimasauskas, facing extradition from Lithuania, denied the allegations. Rimašaukas claims that he is innocent and intends to fight extradition to the United States. His attorney at the Cobalt firm, Linas Kuprusevicius, told Fortune in an email: “Mr. Rimasauskas cannot expect a fair and impartial trial in the U.S.A.” The Baltic Review The independent newspaper from the Baltics – for the World!

Opinion: Even if you can, you probably shouldn't buy a Google Pixel anymore David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/05/01 2:09pm PDTMay 1, 2017 66 Plus 1 on G+ 263 Share on Facebook 60 Share on Twitter Total Shares389 Editorials Pixel Pixel XL The Google Pixel is a notoriously hard phone to get a hold of. Persistent stock issues have plagued Google's first "in-house" handset from day one, and things really are little to no better six months after the launch event. Honestly, it's a bit embarrassing just how consistently incompetent Google seems to be at keeping a reasonable inventory of phones available for purchase. But setting that aside, as one of the Pixel's most ardent evangelists, I think there's something it's probably time for me to come clean on: Even if you could buy a Pixel today, I really think you shouldn't. The Pixel is a product with generation-one product issues. The Bluetooth performance is horrid. It's not waterproof. The bezels really are due for a shrink. I don't think the exterior coating on the black and blue variants is of a particularly high quality. The glass window gets scuffed up incredibly easily. The Snapdragon 821 is officially old news. And it doesn't support proper advanced network features across all four of the big US carriers. There are other flaws I could point to, and while none of them are too terrible, they do speak to the slightly-rushed development cycle this phone seems to have been subjected to. Sure, Google got some things astoundingly right: the performance, the camera, the larger software experience. In fact, I think the Pixel is easily the best Android smartphone ever for these strengths, at least if we're talking about me personally as a user (your mileage, obviously, may vary). But for all the great, smooth, fast, clean, pure, simple, natural, and various other adjective-members singing in the Pixel-praise cavalcade, this phone is not the one to buy right now. For starters, Google continues to ask what is an increasingly laughable amount of money for the model most of us want - the 128GB XL - at a staggering $870. Sure, Apple charges the same for an iPhone 7 Plus 128GB, but I'm under no illusion that this comparison in any way favors Google. The iPhone comes with Apple customer service (with actual stores), a longer software support period going forward, and runs no real risk of poor resale value. The Pixel? Google's online support is iffy at best, we know the phone will be unsupported by October 2018, and I have a strong feeling generation-one Pixel resale values will drop like a rock once the new phones are announced. And that really is why, if you haven't pulled the trigger on a Pixel yet, you should just wait. It's overpriced, under-supported, and competing phones like the Galaxy S8 offer a whole lot more technology for your money. The Galaxy S8+ is $20 less than a 128GB Pixel XL, and I would argue it is far and away the better smartphone value. That amazing display, brand-new Snapdragon 835 processor, jaw-dropping design and packaging, and the full support of all our American carriers' latest LTE advancements could each be a reason on its own to put the Galaxy S8 above Google's smartphone. Do I still prefer using the Pixel over the S8? Sure. But I wouldn't buy a 128GB Pixel XL over a Galaxy S8+ today. That would be, frankly, a bit silly. If Google was asking $670 and not $870, the discussion would probably change, but they aren't. You've got to pay full price, and there's no way I could recommend anyone do that. If you're still on the fence about the Pixel, let me try to push you over: wait for the next generation. I realize that this sort of thinking can devolve into a rationale that encourages you to never upgrade anything because something newer, faster, and better is constantly on the horizon. But in this case, I think it's a consideration that is worth weighing more seriously than usual. Many of the Pixel's biggest flaws relate to Google's inexperience producing a smartphone. Issues that only come up as you try to mass-produce and distribute a product with a real marketing campaign that creates real demand, and the phone gets into the hands of "real" users who aren't part of the now-derailed Nexus phone hypetrain. Inside Google, expectations were no doubt managed, realities realized, and priorities accordingly re-calibrated after this first launch. (Side note: if the Bluetooth performance on the next Pixel is as bad as the first one, I may scream, Google.) Meanwhile, the things that make the Pixel great aren't going anywhere. The next Pixel will be fast, it will take great photos, and it will offer a wonderfully unfettered Android experience. Those that make it less than great? Google is no doubt drilling down through the worst of them in order to ensure the Pixel 2 - or whatever it's called - won't make the same mistakes that the original did (waterproofing, please). And one of the primary reasons to try the Pixel in the first place - to be on the very bleeding edge - really only remains true from a software standpoint. Older phones like the Nexus 5X and 6P don't even let the Pixel have an advantage there, as they're on the same update track until around the time the next Pixel phones launch. If you absolutely need a smartphone soon and the Pixel is tempting you, ask yourself this: Can you deal with a Moto G5 Plus for six months if it means having a better Pixel down the road? While as a reviewer I have the admitted luxury of not needing to consider such things, were I in such a position, I'd have little in the way of a counterargument to offer. Sure, you'll take a resale hit on anything you buy now, but the Pixel is going to face a much, much steeper devaluation curve in that time than any budget phone. Buying a Pixel right now just doesn't make sense. I love my Pixel XL, but I'm officially done recommending the phone to friends and relatives. Instead, I'll tell them to wait, or to get the Galaxy S8 they were probably going to buy anyway. Tags editorial google pixel google pixel xl opinion pixel xl subscribe ...

Google really shot themselves in the foot with availability. My name is…. No, they shot their foot with huge bezels, with lack of waterproof, lack of dual speakers, no real camera progress compared to nexii, meh battery life, meh screen. No real selling point besides being pure android phone. This phone had iphone price but was worst on so many levels (no A10 SoC, no iphone-fast NAND, no 4yrs updates) Oneplus on the other hand........ M. Luciano Also has none of that stuff, but is cheaper? My name is…. yes, half price cheaper. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ The black screen issue kind of negates anything else ;) Michael Hannigan What's the "black screen issue"? Carson Saldanha YOU WANT THE PIXEL TO HAVE THE A10 CHIP?? BHAAAAAAAHAHAHA My name is…. No, i want it to have a cheaper price, or be better somehwere else, like the Galaxy. STOP BEING RUDE Carson Saldanha https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CYF7C6hVAAAKF-_.jpg Tr3ple Shut up troll ,nobody likes you I see lmao My name is…. You know when you see the dumb guy, he always adds 'lol' or 'lmao' at the end of his sentence. And his syntax is always wrong. STFU and GTFO Liam Bulkley "You know when you see the dumb guy... And his syntax is always wrong." "You are an [sic] ignorant" Don't cut yourself on the glass. Michael Hannigan They have that - The Nexus 5x. Тарас Мукин You keep hating Pixel in the comments, but you only look at numbers. But they doesn't matter when it comes to Google. Software experience does. My name is…. That's a stupid argument Тарас Мукин And saying that somebody's argument is stupid without any explanation is a much smarter argument. My name is…. Would you pay 900$ bucks for Nexus 5 just because "Software experience matters"?? Carson Saldanha Nobody said they were paying just for the "software experience" Matt Tapac said that specs don't matter, the software experience does. That heavily implies that people are paying for the software experience. Carson Saldanha xD here we go again drunken_bastard Pixel and Pixel XL have better cameras and screens than any iPhone. The difference in SoC and other bits of hardware, they don't translate into any real world speed differences. Pixel also has great battery life. Perhaps some hands on time may do you some good. supersanborn Given that they continually sell out of the limited stock they have, none of what you cited matters. If they had a ginormous supply of units and THEN couldn't sell, then perhaps you would be on to something. My name is…. What was the availability in the first place? You think they produced many? No way Jose, i bet Galaxies and iphones outsold pixels by multiple times supersanborn We don't exactly know what they had hoped to produce or even what they actually produced, so your point remains conjecture. And who here is suggesting that Samsung and Apple phones didn't outsell the Pixel? My name is…. * by multiple times James Betti Sadly, Google isn't keeping the Pixel in stock because they don't care about their hardware line. Google makes most of its money through ads and personal data. It's a shame, but it explains why they discontinue successful products and barely have much in stock. Excellent phone by the way. Michael Hannigan Well, that's easy to rectify. Do like Amazon and offer the same exact hardware with "special offers" for a lower price. Then you get to see ads everywhere, even your home screen and app drawer. Pretty cool. Michael Hannigan Yes, they did. It was in the millions. Max "no real camera progress compared to nexii, meh battery life, meh screen." Ok, so you don't have a Pixel, we get it. My name is…. I'm not dumb, do you get that too? Xchris I think the consensus here is that you are talking bollocks. The pixel XL has an unbelievably good screen, one of the best battery life figures, still has the best camera out of any smartphone. Nobody who bought the pixel cares that much about any of your other points. In fact, what you are really saying is that you didn't like the pixel. Big deal! My name is…. Actually, i'm fighting the pixel in a nerdy community. Its expected that the consensus is that "i am talking bollocks". People here mainly wanna root their phones and put center clocks on status bar. they did the same with Nexii devices, its all about the software, but those phones were seriosly lacking (i used to own all Nexus devices after 4) Carson Saldanha So may I ask, what phone do you use now? My name is…. 1+3 Carson Saldanha Srsly!?!? Bruh, the OnePlus 3 has a Snapdragon 820 while the Pixel has a 821, a far better camera, better performance, and software. How is the OP3 better than the Pixel? Besides the price? I could probably understand if you had the OP3T, but no way. My name is…. You are an ignorant. 1) Check the speedtests, 1+3 is faster (because better nand) 2) Software is better on 1+3 (aosp with tiny mods) 3) Pixel has underclocked 821, thus 820 with a little bit of better battery life (1+3 has 1080p screen to tie this up) 4) 1+3 has 6gb ram (will be good for 4 years) 5) 1+3 is smaller than pixels, unbelievably thin 6) 1+3 has dash charging (world leading) 7) 1+3 has half the price 8) 1+3T is another story, far better Apply cream to the burn, son PS Yes Pixel has a better camera. Carson Saldanha Ignorance at it's finest. My name is…. Those are all FACTS, son. My name is…. Where are you, son? Jack Smith Have you ever even used a Pixel? Only Android phone i have used with zero touch lag. Can we also stop the name calling? Mason Andrew Maseda Hate to break it to you man. I own The One Plus 3T the Google Pixel the Nexus 6P and the Moto X pure edition. Lol. Guess witch one is my daily driver? The Pixel. Why? Better battery . Better cam. All around the most reliable phone. Even with my Nexus 6P I've had some issues here and there tiny ones. Like some days my battery life was abnormally shit and the next day it was great. The one plus 3T has tiny issues too. The Pixel is a phone that you wouldn't understand UNLESS YOU TRY ONE FOR A DAY. come back when you do. tansuperman Not sure why people think the pixel takes good pics. I have a pixel xl, 950xl, IPhone 7plus, and now the s8. In my opinion the pixel xl takes the worst pics. The lumia 950xl is stop dog. The pixel I can tell is just too overprocessed Michael Hannigan I think it applies mostly to low light pictures - absolutely nothing touches the Pixel in that respect - trust me. More generally, it applies to the software and hardware working together to create stunning (real) HDR pictures. But in low.light, which according to a friend of mine who is a smartphone camera freak (I am not), quality of low light pictures are what users are primarily interested in because he says "...any recent smartphone can take great pictures in daylight.". For me, I liked the flexibility of the V20 camera - not just the dual lenses, but the absolutely fantastic functions in the camera app. D13H4RD2L1V3 Um, the 821 consumes less power than the 820 at the lower clocks due to a more efficient binning process. Also, both the Pixel and OP3 use UFS 2 controllers. But on Nougat, the 3 uses F2FS for its filesystem. It's not a case of better NAND. It's a case of different filesystems. Michael Hannigan I think they should use FAT16. I miss it. Chris Rey I will say the Axon 7 is just as good as the OnePlus 3 and looks better. Suicide_Note The Pixel camera is definitely superior to what was in the 6P, and i say that as someone who currently owns them both. M. Luciano I use both on a daily basis. Agree with you 100%. So do objective measurements of the cameras. Pixel is the best on the market; 6P is decent but not great. andy_o On paper both cameras should be just short of identical, but the Pixel is so much faster in processing cause of the HVX dedicated core, plus the N6P throttles like crazy (in one of my photospheres tests in a warm room the Nexus 6 beat it every time). This is crucial especially with Google who is prioritizing computational photography probably on par or more with hardware camera specs. Also, I'm not sure if this is a hardware or artificial limitation, but HDR+ auto has completely different behavior on the Pixels. I can understand how someone who has only looked at the specs and not used a Pixel and N6P (especially in the summertime), can think that there's been "no real camera progress", but this guy is balls-deep in the "arrogance of ignorance". Michael Hannigan I think the reason for the difference in HDR+ in the Pixel is that it's" real HDR - it takes several pictures and then layers them. Other phones have taken a shortcut do doing that with one picture and it really doesn't achieve the same. Except in one case - manually setting HDR in my Note 7 gave absolutely stunning night time photos. Something I can't quite achieve with the built in software on the Pixel (but can with Photoshop). andy_o I was talking the difference between HDR+ auto in the Pixel and HDR+ auto in the previous phones. The auto behavior in the Pixel is different, but the HDR+ processing is basically the same. There's more info here: http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/11/21/deep-dive-closer-look-google-pixels-camera/#What_does_HDR_do If you feel nerdy enough I can link you to a paper on HDR+ by the Google computational photography team too :) Regarding the other phone cameras, the reason they do worse isn't exactly that they they're taking shortcuts, it's actually because they're doing it the traditional way, taking different exposures. Read the AP article linked above for details on how HDR+ is fundamentally different. Michael Hannigan You have OLED burn-in? I have about 8 hours SOT/day and don't have any. That would piss me off. Jason B Inverting colors for a bit while doing some extended reading helps. Black background with white text is easier on the eyes too. But yeah, static nav bar and notification area aren't great for OLED. There should be auto pixel shift to prevent it ... or Google should make more use of Immersive Mode. whispy_snippet Ugh. Like a broken fucking record here sometimes. Shawn Spring While some of your other points may/may not be valid, to say that the Pixel had "no real camera progress compared to nexii" just makes you sound ignorant. The S821 ISP alone would make the camera in the Pixel superior, not to mention the updated HDR algorithms. Get a Pixel owner and a 6P owner in the same room (I was both) and ask them to shoot with each others phone and see who prefers which. The 6P camera lag in HDR mode was inefficient at best and unbearable at worst. And it wasn't that long ago that OnePlus was using a broken invite system, had people lick their phones, and had a horribly gender insensitive marketing campaign. I'd probably not hold them up as the standard bearer against Google. Michael Hannigan They had people lick their phones? Why did they never ask me to do that? That's discrimination. I should have been asked to lick my phone. Brett Lewis I love my pixel after coming from a HTC 8x on Windows platform. Never liked Apple and never will. And lately after all the talk of Samsung's products (blowing up, red screens, other problems) I'm quite happy with my pixel. I don't need water proofing I'm not an idiot that takes my phone near water.. the I hardly notice the bezels after coming from a 4.3 inch 720 display.. The htc8x had one of the widest angle front cameras but I dont take selfies. This pixel does what I want and is fast doing it. And for first time experiencing Android I'm quite happy with buying this with the newest and best version available. TheHater So only idiots take their phones near water? I bet if you had a water resistant phone, you'd take it near water. Michael Hannigan What about the toilet? Who doesn't read the news when sitting on the shitter? Mariano Moreira I would definitely agree in terms of the Pixel XL vs iPhone 7 plus comparisons (Non-32GB model) Comparing the base iPhone 7 vs base Pixel...the iPhone 7 base had(has) slow Nand performance from what I have witnessed. The 32GB iPhone 7 vs base 32GB Pixel (5") seems like a closer comparison where the compromise is better battery life on the Pixel, faster Nand, and better screen. Again, I concur that looking at the Pixel XL vs iPhone 7 Plus leans more heavily towards Apple especially when comparing the 128GB models. Michael Hannigan If you buy from the Google store, they are carrier agnostic - absolutely 0 carrier bloatware. Mariano Moreira No. I have a Google Play(Bootloader unlocked) purchased Pixel. Normally used on Sprint or At&t. When I activate on Verizon: to get Vo-LTE calling with Verizon SIM and certain carrier settings it does a software update switching the phone over to the Verizon specific software build. If it was truly Carrier-agnostic it wouldn't force a Carrier specific Software build onto my non-Verizon model Pixel. Michael Hannigan You must have either bought it from Verizon or screwed something up. An unlocked phone doesn't suddenly become carrier specific like you describe Mike John Quincy Adams I don't one person who owns or says ’I sure wish I had a OnePlus.' Michael Hannigan I have - when I had the OnePlus One. Many people asked me about it. You can't deny that OnePlus phones offer an unbeatable value. They don't skimp on specs and sell for half the.price they should. asrat_24 I get you're trying to make fun of that guy but don't make ignorant statements while trying to do it. Oneplus makes good phones and people are interested enough nowadays to say that. Major Sceptic Agree on all points , a mid range device with a flagship price , perhaps Google will adjust the prices on the 2 ? for a company trying to expand it's phone sales it's going a funny way about it . Artem Russakovskii Well, usually at that point you start seeing significant discounts, but the Pixel is a misnomer in that regard to due to low stock and high demand. Max Exactly, I would revise that affirmation to state: "I've always felt once we are less than 6 months from the new iteration, it's a mistake to buy the existing product *at full price*." supersanborn I'll grant there's a case to be made for some phones where waiting can result in substantial discounts (especially from HTC/LG/etc). Probably a little of my bias sneaks in here. I prefer to have the newer device, and if I waited 6 months post-launch, it probably means I myself need to wait until the next launch. Max I'm with you there, I usually buy a phone at launch or a couple of months later at most but remember that we aren't regular customers, that's why we read and comment on this site ;). For many people out there it makes more sense to buy a phone six months after release if it comes with a nice worthy discount. M. Luciano This ^^ supersanborn Agreed, for some, shaving $100-200 off the price is all that matters. I usually caution folk pretty hard in the last 3 months before the new iteration drops if they have any form of new feature/size/color envy. supersanborn And yeah, I'm nowhere near the "normal" consumer :-) needa Supposed to be picking up a 32gb XL (Google) for $450 near mint in a couple hours. I might not get it, but a killer deal nonetheless. M. Luciano Smash that deal :) Very nice. needa A few little scratches on the back glass. Profit.

The lowest I've seen on Swappa was $695 for a black XL. supersanborn True. I usually find that the discounts are kind of on the "meh" side though until we hit release of new product. I always basically tell folks that you either buy it at launch until about 6ish months post-launch, and if you've held off that long, you should just wait until next launch and either buy the old product at a big discount or buy the new one. Matt I believe your use of misnomer was a bit of a misnomer. Artem Russakovskii I did use the wrong word, you're right. el_smurfo That's why I just picked up a 6p last year for $400. Most expensive smartphone I've ever bought, but the full release price was just not in my budget. Karly Johnston Battery issues? MisterAlex Maybe an anomaly... but not a misnomer. paxmos Where is this high demand you guys talk about?, I have yet to see a pixel in anyone's hand M. Luciano Really? I know over a dozen people who have or had them. paxmos Yep...I see lots of iPhones and Sammy's, even one Blackberry Z30, have only seen a pixel in the Verizon store. M. Luciano I feel like a nerd owning 4 Major Sceptic It does seem to have more of an enthusiast following , no shortage of pixels in my region , the usual brands , apple, Samsung, still seem to have the sales , I know not one person that has a pixel or wants one , and I think Google only has itself to blame on that front, Re : the cost of a pixels . Goblin Shark Finally, someone who knows what they're taking about - my head is just shaking in disbelief reading what these marshmallow brains that think they know about phones are saying on this comment thread lol Daishi Exactly. I have yet to see a Pixel in the wild. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ To be fair, HTC isn't used to such a high demand for their phones. Google unfortunately paid the price Daishi This made me LOL! A post full of WIN for sure!! Zoglog Actually it's probably because of all the RMA's they've gotten JD Thought that was obvious. syxbit I wonder whether we shouldn't wait for Pixel + 2. The next Pixel may technically be the first Google made product (current Pixel is made by HTC), so it's possible the Pixel 2 will have first gen problems. Still, I still have the N6P (after I scoffed at the Pixel price and refused to buy it), so I going to be looking for a phone soon. Good_Ole_Pinocchio HTC is also manufacturing the Pixel 2. Word on the street. Daishi That's too bad. I'll avoid this this phone as well... Captain On! Well, technically the iPhone is made by Foxconn, so... Don't expect Google to actually build their own facilities to produce hardware. Carson Saldanha Pretty sure they'll still be using HTC. Might have more control over the design this time around though. 4Ui812 The availability issue is a play out Nintendo's handbook. Good_Ole_Pinocchio 100% agree with the entire article... Do I want the Pixel Software Experience and Camera? Yes... But not when the new version is a few months away thag would probably fix all the issues I see posted on this site ever so often...starting with the Bluetooth issues. I got an S8... Because it's the only phone thay makes sense to me right now..... I'll see what Google is doing in the fall Max Johnson If the Moto G5 Plus had NFC I would have no problem making it my Android daily driver for the next 6 months. wade_county Moto Z Play and OP3/OP3T are other options with NFC. shadowx360 I used to buy 1 generation old Nexus devices to get around the cost issue, but it seems the 5X and 6P both are plagued by serious phone-killing issues. Now that warranty is up on nearly every used 5X/6P, buying used is like trying to navigate a minefield. I don't really trust 1st generation Pixel to not have serious issues either. I'd never use a non-Pixel/Nexus device but I can't buy a Pixel XL knowing Samsung offers so much better hardware at a similar price. wade_county My advice is getting the next OnePlus phone or picking up a used OP3/OP3T. AndrewGM I bought a used Pixel in good shape on eBay, as I couldn't get one from Google Store (already had a wireless provider). Switched from an iPhone 6s, after using almost every iPhone model since and including the original. Much better camera on the Pixel, especially closeups and in low light, and much easier to use overall (especially Contacts vs. iOS), as I've used mostly Google apps for a long time. I like the Google keyboard much better and the Android interface. I'm definitely satisfied with the Pixel and have no real iPhone regrets. It's true there are more apps for the iPhone, but that doesn't matter because the core apps are available on Android too. The only app I miss is Enlight, for photo editing. The one Pixel issue I agree with is the relatively poor resale value vs. iPhones (I assume). Carson Saldanha May I suggest Snapseed for photo editing? (It's developed by Google) Also, do you miss iMessage/FaceTime or is that really a con? AndrewGM Will check out Snapseed, thanks. I've been using Google Photos to lightly edit pics. The Pixel camera is so good that I often don't edit (for Instagram/FB uploads), especially if the light and composition are already good. I don't miss iMessage at all. I had to turn it off and all that stuff for my phone number when I switched, but I'm texting away every day. Emoticons seem to work fine. I don't even think about iMessage. FaceTime has been replaced with Duo for my family members, including those on iPhone. Seems to work fine. And I can share location with family members via Google Maps. I guess that brings up privacy issues vs. using Apple products, but not sure it makes a real-world difference. Battery life, btw, seems pretty good (I charge the phone overnight only). The call quality is a little less than iPhone, maybe, but overall acceptable. AndrewGM Will add that I have had the Pixel for 2 months and use it daily. I like the screen on the Pixel (or at least it never bothers me), and the issue about the "chin" at the bottom being big is a non-issue to me. I don't notice it and in fact hold the phone sometimes there, which is arguably convenient. If the phone continues to hold up, I'll be a customer for Pixel 2 eventually. Eric I was ready to jump to the Pixel XL after returning my second Note 7, but Google never gave me the opportunity to give them my money. Carson Saldanha xD My name is…. It was never a good device. thank you for finally admitting that. Andrew I don't think that's what the author is saying... My name is…. Someone had to be crazy to buy a pixel in the first place. I was bashing on that device from day one. Author, months later, says that the phone is no good. It was never good. Carson Saldanha Lord, would you just chill? Tr3ple I think he's retarded, gotta be it, lol. Must be it actually. Carson Saldanha troll by far Suicide_Note Except that's not at all what the author said, so you're either: A) trolling, B) incredibly dumb, or C) both of the above. Тарас Мукин Of course there's no point in buying Pixel for full price now. And there's more: there's no point in buying any device for it's starting price when it's 3 months old — tech gets old really fast today. And that's the whole point of not buying something at day one — everything gets much cheaper very fast. Samsungs do, LGs too. But Pixel for some reason didn't. And Nexuses were like this too. So — only buying Google devices right after release makes sense. Or buying them unofficially and cheaper. Sad, but true. sraj49 I always like and respect your articles. You put your views straight forward. But I tend not to agree with the tone and content of this article completely. I am living in Home of full Apple products and I own a Pixel XL. I love the Pixel in all aspects. Yes there are room to improvements which is true for everyone. Apple products are well designed, well built. As regards sorry gone are those days when Apple sorry was at is best which was until iPhone 4s/ iPhone 5. Now after the warmth period it is the same as Pixel. I going Pixel after sales support very good. I definitely agree with you on the most inefficient handling of supplies and also this is not the time to buy since meet models are coming. Just to add, I get sick when people say that the Pixel phones are not made by Google but by HTC. Everyone outsources manufacturing. Most of the phone are made by Foxcon staying from Apple. All phone manufacturers only design the hardware, software and the manufacturing is outsourced. Good_Ole_Pinocchio The HTC point that keeps coming up comes from the fact that Google didn't really dsign much hardware hete. They just used HTC parts. It's not the same as hardware being designed by apple then manufactureres elsewhere. andy_o I think he's right on that point. Google support may or may not be good, but it's online only. Apple support is famously good. For instance, the recent fixes for iPhone 6s battery problems. I booked an appointment, went into the store, they told me it would be a bit, went to a coffee shop, they emailed me, picked it up. Another time my iPad mini 2 mute switch broke. Again, appointment, go in the store, got it actually just exchanged on the spot. Google simply cannot do that. JohnyNoLegs What android phones have you owned prior to the pixel? And yes it's a HTC phone through and through. Scofabear Shots fired! I even dumped my 6P for a Moto z play. No regrets Futbolrunner Same here! That 808 was a lag fest. I even got the S8+ but returning it because it can't touch the Play's battery life. Dominic D I just bought a Pixel a month ago. I still would recommend it if you get one for fairly cheaply on swappa. It's awesome. Brian Demodulated My last 3 phones have been Nexus. Each has been less reliable than the last. I love how hackable they are but I think my next phone will be a Samsung Galaxy. Carson Saldanha Elaborate? Wdym by "less reliable" What issues? Brian Demodulated My Samsung Galaxy Nexus was incredible and still works today. My Nexus 5 was garbage - two broke within 1.5 years. My 6P is quirky - it doesn't charge on my home PC and although my wife's updated to 7.1.2 mine says it's up to date at 7.1.1. Tr3ple Get a pixel then, Samsung lol. Brian Demodulated I have my 6P another year. I'll see what's available next year when my contract is up. JohnyNoLegs Bootloops, dodgy updates, requires factory resets, breaks features, slow bug fixes. M. Luciano No offense, but you are not going to increase stability by going to Samsung. Brian Demodulated My old Samsung Galaxy Nexus was the best, highest quality, most reliable phone I ever owned. LG and Huawei's Nexus phones were less stable for me. M. Luciano I had a few of those.. they weren't as reliable. But probably because I did bad things to them. Brian Demodulated I rooted mine, loaded hacky ROMs, and carried it with me everywhere I went for 3 years. The USB and audio cables are a little loose now but otherwise it's saved me when my later Nexus phones crapped out on me. Vitali Galaxy nexus had clean stock rom, it is just Google's clean soft in a Samsung physical device and not with samsung's os Brian Demodulated Every Nexus has the clean stock ROM. It's one of the top reasons why I get them. JohnyNoLegs Going Pixel sure doesn't increase stability. It's less stable than my Note 4/Note 7. Vitali Agree with M. Luciano, but people try should move to Sony. Lookup at speed test videos of their Xperia XZs, it has beaten all smartphones by now, including the Pixel. All the biased big reviewers out there will never tell you the truth, stop thinking the S8 is the best phone in the world.. I recommend you to wait for their Xperia XZ Premium it will have sd835! After you see the XZs speed, I promise you it may be the fastest phone even in 2018. Suicide_Note No. Just...no. Vitali *A wild 8 year old fanboy comment appears* Brian Demodulated Speed isn't that important to me. I've heard bad things about Sony's flavour of Android and that it's bloaty. Vitali So you heard wrong, their software is one of the bests out there, and im talking from experience.. And Samsung have so clean and fast Android that it is just unbelievable.. Where do you get all that info from?? Vitali So you heard wrong, their software is one of the bests out there, and im talking from experience.. And Samsung have so clean and fast Android that it is just unbelievable.. "I've heard.." Where do you get all that info from?? Suicide_Note TW is much better than it used to be, but it's hardly clean and fast. Brian Demodulated I work in a large IT department. One of my buddies told me about it. He said Sony's Android UI was all over the place and annoying to use, and that his handset was 2 major versions behind the latest version of Android OS. dtox Lol don't listen to him, xperia phones are absolute trash. dtox LOL xperia = garbage D13H4RD2L1V3 Um, I'm not entirely sure. Not that I'm ragging Sony, but they haven't exactly been selling for a reason. Even Sony themselves know. I don't hate Sony phones. I personally think they're understated, solid offerings. Problem was that they were really overpriced. After seeing the XZs and XA1, seems like their pricing may have become more logical. We'll see how it goes. I'm personally hoping the XZP may even be a solid device. Not that I'll buy one but if the price is right, it'll be significantly easier to recommend. JSo Experiences differ from person to person. But It's odd the luck you have had with the Nexus devices. I've had the Galaxy Nexus, Nexus 5 and now the Nexus 5X and I have never had an issue with any of them. JohnyNoLegs No battery issues with 5X? My wifes upgraded to 7.1.1 and has never been the same, bluetooth is slow and laggy, and the battery barely gets 1.5-2 hours SOT after it used to get close to 3. Michael Hannigan Dude, you're talking about a crusty old obsolete phone. And unless you are happy getting 2 hours of battery time, you should pry the wallet open and buy something current. Complaining about your old phone won't make you feel better. Replacing it with a working, current phone that's not past it's expected useful life will. JohnyNoLegs Dude, wth are you talking about. It's a 1.5 years old. From new it was getting 4-5, right up until 7.1.1 update. Roy My 6P is the most reliable phone ever. And I had Samsung and HTC. Duder12 The last Nexus phones had bum processors from qc. royrov My Nexus 6P kissed the asphalt a couple of weeks ago, so I bought a perfect Pixel XL second hand (used 3-4 months). Its better, no regrets here. Faster and better battery, hell even snapchat is snappy on it! Tr3ple Exaclty lol, people saying the pixel isn't an upgrade to the 6p are delusional lol. They all like to hate on it u til they get one and realize how good of a phone it is. And all the bugs I've been seeing on the net are nowhere to be found and I had mine for 5-6 months now bekifft I know it's an upgrade. It's just not much of an upgrade for an enormous amount of money. Tr3ple My 6p had serious issues, I went and got a s7 egde(big mistake), the price I paid was well worth it. I'm still financing my s7 egde while I'm using a pixel, this is how much I love this phone. destinyhud I will still buy one Michael Tran If I could give you a phone for free but you had to keep it and use it and couldn't sell it. Which phone would it be? M. Luciano 128 GB Pixel XL, black supersanborn My 128GB Pixel XL in black. At least until the 2 comes and **hopefully** adds waterproofing, 600Mhz support, 4x4MIMO for T-Mobile. If you're reading, Pixel team, let's talk! Orlando aka Pixel XL Samsung Galaxy S8+ blue Tr3ple Gimme a 128 gb pixel XL black any day keithzg The bezels really are due for a shrink. Boy are you gonna rue this when the second-gen comes out and the bezels are the exact same ;) M. Luciano I sorta hope they are :) keithzg You animal! (But honestly, this is why choice is good. I find the desire for those top and bottom bezels incomprehensible, but I can entirely understand that not everyone would feel the way I do, particularly if routinely holding phones very differently.) M. Luciano I just want SOME bezels. They don't need to be huge. Just want a place to put my thumbs when holding it sideways. It's a good place for speakers IMO. Carson Saldanha Nah, to be fair, I think Google's definitely not planning on keeping them the same size if they've listened to the reviews. keithzg I mean, if they'd listened to reviews of many other phones before they put out the Pixels they would have known that too---including, for instance, the previous two generations of Nexus phones . . . So it seems likely that either (a) they know of the opinions of the commentariat and disagree, or (b) they felt technically they couldn't do it. I'm personally hoping it was somehow just (b) but they used (a) to convince themselves that it was an okay sacrifice, but that they won't have to make the same sacrifice again this year and they'll allow themselves to change up the design. But I'm not gonna bet too much money on that. Carson Saldanha Whoa, you lost be there with all those "a's" and "b's" xD Shawn Spring I think its pretty well known at this point that the time frame between when Google's negotiations w/Huawei fell through and when they picked the deal up with HTC was the cause of the "let's use the leftover A9 shells" bezel issue. So more (b) than (a) assuredly. ikeofkc If they do. Peoples' thumb muscles are going to be screwed if they use the pixel 1 handed, constantly trying to reach the back button. The chin makes one handed use possible keithzg See, that's what I mean about different folks and different strokes. I've never noticed it being of any help with my Nexus 6P, for me the top and bottom bezels are completely useless. bekifft If they actually put something useful there, like a front facing stereo speaker, I would be totally fine with that. keithzg Dammit, don't you go making me miss the Nexus 6 again! Michael Hannigan I want them to be bigger. I want to be able to lean on mine when I am standing in line at a movie. MadMartigan I am constantly amazed by the short memories. The author thinks it likely they are likely to have a better launch of P2? They do give the obvious impression that they believe the Pixel to be their first swing and a miss... Funny how quickly we forget, well, nearly every other device Google has ever tried to sell. I personally loved my 4, 10, 5, 6, and 6. But I cannot, while keeping a straight face, argue that one should expect anything better from them regarding inventory management this time around. How many times does Google have to fail on inventory management before we start pointing and laughing at the people who constantly say, "They'll get it right this time, for sure." Don't get me wrong - I would absolutely love it if Google proved me wrong on the P2. I just won't believe it until I see it. //dons flameproof suit// A'ight, I'm ready. Fire away... M. Luciano This is their first swing and a miss, but only because the shortages are for very different reasons than prior devices they sold on behalf of other OEM's. MadMartigan Who...who do you think made the Pixels? M. Luciano Google is the OEM for the Pixel phones (and tablets, and laptops, etc). HTC is the factory putting the phones together. It's a totally different legal and business agreement, and essentially means that Google has to supply most of the components, contracts, contacts, etc. and HTC is essentially an assembly line. On Nexus phones, the OEM was Samsung, or LG or Huawei, etc. and they actually designed and produced the phones, in partnership with and input from Google. Completely different. For those, the partner was able to do all the contracting and sourcing; HTC isn't doing all the work for Google this time. MadMartigan So you don't believe HTC designed the Pixel. Got it. That's all I needed to see. M. Luciano Not sure what that means, but ok. Google is now the OEM, that's what I am saying. Another Scott Nice post. I hemmed and hawed about a Pixel XL 128 for 6 weeks last fall and finally decided I just couldn't do it. Besides the fact that it was impossible to get from Google, I just couldn't justify the price. I decided to finally replace my LG Nexus 4 (roughly $350 new) with a new T-Mobile LG V10 from B&H in November for $330 and am quite pleased. (It would have been $300 a week or so later.) I added a Samsung EVO 128 GB SDHC card for it for $40 or so. I miss the Nexus timely updates a great deal, but I can't see spending a kilobuck on a phone to get it - especially for only a 2 year OS upgrade availability. I hope Google gets the Pixel 2 right, but maybe they figure having a "premium" phone for evangelists is good enough so they won't feel any pressure to make it available (or cut the price). Cheers, Scott. fijisiv The Galaxy S8+ is $20 less than a 128GB Pixel XL Just wow. M. Luciano Right? The Pixel is by far a better value at those prices. 128 GB storage over 16, metal over glass body, better software, better security, better camera, guaranteed to be up to date for 3 years... Samsung has some great components, but as a package, Pixel seems to keep ahead at this point. Matt I believe the S8+ is 64G and has a microSD slot. M. Luciano I think you're right. IMO that makes the Pixel better. Do you prefer less with expandable option? 03grunt I live in the mountains of NC and went back to Verizon once they brought back unlimited data and luckily the local Verizon store had a Pixel XL. I think it's pretty sad that in ~ 18 months the Pixel will be EOL. M. Luciano Luckily, it won't be. Nexus and Pixel devices are guaranteed to be fully up to date for 3 years; not 2. 2 years of major updates and 3 years of security updates = 3 years of being fully up to date. Sir_Brizz That's not entirely true. They are only guaranteed to be on the latest version for 2 years. It's unlikely it will be any different than the Nexus 6 in this regard (which didn't get 7.1 but is still getting monthly security updates). M. Luciano The Pixel and Pixel XL released October 4, 2016. They're guaranteed to be fully up to date until 10/31/2019. That's 1121 days, or 3.07 years. Sir_Brizz No. You are wrong. They are only guaranteed version updates until October 2018. The Nexus 6 was guaranteed the same thing until October 2016. It did not get Android 7.1 even though it continues to get monthly security updates. What this means is that the Pixel will get at least Android 9.0 but that doesn't guarantee it will get 9.1 or 9.2 or anything else past that. It just means it will get 9.0 and monthly security updates to 9.0 for an additional year. M. Luciano I get what you're saying, but it also launches on the latest update. So using the Pixel, it launches with N, will get O after a year, will get P after a year and then is not guaranteed to get Q. Are we really going to get a Q? So during each of those three updates, N, O and P, it on the latest OS and getting monthly security updates. 2 years of updates, so long as it includes the 2nd major OS update, translates to three full years. Ever since they started the annual number and letter update, we're essentially talking about a single API version update per year (2016 had 2, including the one you're referencing which impacted Shamu). Sir_Brizz I've already pointed this out twice: look at the Nexus 6 for a first hand example of how this is going to work. The Nexus 6 will not be on the latest version of Android for three years because it is already not on the latest version of Android despite getting monthly security updates. 03grunt Thanks for clarifying! Chris Kiederer As a Nexus 5X/project Fi user, right now the Pixel is my only choice if my Nexus decides to blow up like many before it. I really hope this Android one rumor heading to the US is true, as it would give project Fi subscribers more than just a really expensive option to stay on the plan Andye82 But exactly one year from today it will be still extremely difficult if not impossible to get your hands on pixel 2 Mix "Persistent stock issues have plagued Google's first "in-house" handset from day one..." I am on my 3rd phone and I still wonder, every time I use it, if it will be like my last two phones. I have phone PTSD! Google should just pull a Nintendo and just stop producing and move on to the 2 but not fuck it up. John Doe Great job on the article, now I will be waiting for the editorial on Google's software update policy LoL PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Google's inexperience producing a smartphone They had great experience running Motorola. Ammar "Sure, Google got some things astoundingly right: the performance, the camera, the larger software experience" To be honest, these are the only reasons why I'd ever get a Pixel over any other Android phone. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ I agree with some of Radar's points as well as teh main one as I've *never* recommended the XL because I know that the vast majority of people are sheep-like followers and/or technophobes, and I defifnitely don't want part of the onus for a technophobe's major purchase that they're going to rue the second that an iPhoner mocks them. The Pixel sells itself to PowerUsers on its own merit, which, AEB the popularity of inferior and/or questionable top-sellers, clearly supports my previous assertions. JPLoureiro Deciphering of your sentences will commence............. now. Futbolrunner What? Marty I never was going to buy an HTC Pixel. Don't like HTC and the build quality doesn't deserve such a high price. jawsnnn My SOs Pixel is probably the buggiest Google phone I have used till date. The Google Assistant, voice search are consistently broken and the phone doesn't offer much else in way of justifying it's price. Will definitely buy an OEM phone next. Google's hardware experiment is dead for me. Tim Harman I wish I'd read this 2 weeks ago! Oh well. I've got a Pixel now and I do love it. I live in NZ and the version I ended up with is the American one, which means that while it supports all my LTE bands, it doesn't support Carrier Aggregation on the bands used here. So that's my excuse for why I simply MUST HAVE the P2 when it's released. Damian Stuart Wow, what a load of crap! The Pixel is a superb phone with issues affecting small numbers of devices. I have one, after moving away from the Samsung range. I have had no issues and as I don't ever intend to take a phone swimming haven't got a single complaint about it. But haters gonna hate. sebastianer @David Ruddock Don't forget the terrible compass. If you grab an iPhone 5S and a Pixel. Open Google Maps in both of them. An you start walking trough dense downtowns the whole day (closing / opening maps at different places). You will see that the Pixel compass accuracy is constantly changing every time you open maps and is a total mess while the 5S is perfectly accurate after 1-2 seconds and less than one step. I hope the next Pixel has a completely new sensor...or compass or whatever. Last 3-4 Google Phones were a mess. I think the last Google phone with more or less good compass was the galaxy nexus but I can't even remember now TechGuy22 i'm selling mine soon since i know i can sell it around 600 dollars and it's the 128GB wjrandon So glad I kept my Nexus 6P for a second year... and look at those rock solid resale values. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9d5926ba5094521287d1d54e2476d3852462178bdf74a16166f94742b435213c.jpg TechGuy22 i sold mine for 500 dollars and i bought it used too lol that's how i managed to get the XL 128GB eric messenger It depends on what phone your coming from. For most android users it is a great phone with a great camera. If your coming from an iPhone the pixel is the first great alternative to an iphone. The on device support is actually awesome and they are very quick with support issues. I am used to Nexus devices plagued with serious issues that you had to work around and while they were great phones for the price I felt they all suffered (maybe not the 6P). Anyway the point is pixel raised the bar for Android and brought it up to par with Apple. It's probably still worth buying if you have to upgrade, and you can just get the pixel 3 in 2019 or 2020. Sean You can say this about any phone at the moment....wait for next gen. As a Project Fi user I am waiting on a phone that has the cell radio to take advantage of T-mobile's new 600mhz band they are quickly rolling out...and NO, it cant be done with a software update on any phone. me me "quickly rolling out"? The spectrum is sold but not available yet as the current user vacates.... Sean NOT TRUE....they are rolling it out in areas NOW where the old TV stations have already vacated the band. Google is your friend. me me finally, you realize it was crap, was always, still now, only thing now is you changed. Never worth the money, specs so-so for the price. Islam Google Pixel poor use of space. over-priced. BS Sean People that actually OWN one dont agree........ TechGuy22 i agree and i have one. sadly, it just stopped caring about the bezel since there's nothing i can do to make it look better VAVAMk_2 6P user here with a new battery happily waiting it out for Pixel 2. Sean Boot loop much? Ernie I have had my Nexus 6p since day one of the release. I have been lucky not to have encountered the boot loop or battery problems others have reported. I love my Nexus 6p. Hope it will get Android O. Phone_Addiction Pixel 2 probably going be the same story. Google will never learn. Dean F Marsh I love my Pixel XL! Invest in a good quality case and enjoy the phone. It's really pretty decent and for a few minor quirks mentioned, and none that I have experience yet, I can't be happier. From Nexus, HTC, Samsung, to Pixel XL, this has been the best so far. Ailín Ó’S I live in Ireland and Pixel isn't even available here yet which is odd given we were a launch country for Nexus 5x/6p but hey ho. Rick Schoonmaker This is just what I like to read after getting banged by Google and Huawei with the 6P bootloop issue 1 year and 2 days (read 2 days out of warranty) after buying and being told that my only option is to buy a new phone. So after being without a phone for a week, I had to buy a Pixel XL even though I really didn't want it and especially at the ridiculous price ($860 for 32Gb.. are you effing kidding?). Matt Definitely. I got a pixel XL the very first morning when it was available in local store. Great phone, camera, software. 2 months later, the phone began to behave crazily--extra hot, microphone malfunction. Called Google support for like 10 times and had it replaced, then I put the brand new replacement on local trade platform without hesitation. Google-brand is attatractive, but does not worth that rediculous amount of money. I can get a even better performed oneplus counterpart for almost half price. Anyway, I am on my moto x 2014 with lineage os 14 and i am pretty happy. It is sufficient for me to deal with my daily work. And I also suggest to wait for the release of more flagships from variant companies to have more flexible and reasonable options. Spinkick Google seems to not be able to follow through on anything these days. It just seems like if its not sexy or cool and needs actual work, they cant be bothered. Maybe they will release another chat app in the meantime.. 2 Men-E I want the Pixel 2 XXL (Taimen). It better exist as a 5.6"+ screened device. Philip Although if you're with TMobile. It's significantly cheaper to buy the Pixel, and get your money's worth. Granted the Pixel is guaranteed two years of support, it matches with TMobile promotion pay credit time. h4rr4r They offer a discount? I thought it was just financing. Philip Yep. $325 in TMobile bill credits over two years. Which is when the Pixel 3 will be out. So you buy a Pixel, get refunded about half of the cost. And then you're ready to upgrade to the third generation. belac77 shhh, David, I just listed my Pixel for sale on Swappa! ;) Mason Andrew Maseda This entire article is just terrible and written by someone just mad they don't have one. M. Luciano lol he got one the week after I did. He's had one. Adrianus Bratanata Supply and demand. As long as there is bigger demand than supply they don't need to reduce the price drunken_bastard I disagree. All the pros you mentioned for the Pixel -- pure Android experience, performence, camera, etc -- those are all the reasons why the Pixel and Pixel XL is still the best smartphone on the market. Worried a new one is going to come out? Happens with every flagship, every year. This one doesn't have the lastest SoC? I challenge you to demonstrate real world differences in actual speed versus the Galaxy S8, which is a gorgeous handset that yet again is crippled by bloated software and long standing issues that never seem to get addressed. You cite support potentially ending in October 2018 for software updates, but that's still a longer window than any other Android flagship, and you get them day one, which Samsung and LG don't. A smartphone is more than the sum of it's parts. It's an experience. I feel on that quality alone, the Pixel and Pixel XL are the best representations to date. NeMoDoSeZ I was going to buy a 128gb Pixel XL but due to not being available I ended up waiting and purchasing a Galaxy S8+. I'm now glad things ended up the way they did because I'm loving my S8+. Rod Until Android 8 is released. Then you'll like: fuck Samsung man! My U$xxx phone is outdated, goddamnit! Owen Iverson I hate the world of tech. We've now gotten used to NEEDING the latest thing IMMEDIATELY. Its why companies like Microsoft, Adobe, and Autodesk have switched to monthly/yearly subscriptions so you have to pay for the rest of your life. "The Bluetooth performance is horrid." What metric, speed? Connectivity? "It's not waterproof." Not sure that waterproof is a common trait among all high-end phones just yet. "The bezels really are due for a shrink." I've never used a bezel-less phone, where do you pick it up or hold it? Does your finger trigger anything on the edges? "The Snapdragon 821 is officially old news." What are you running where 1) you see lag and 2) that it's an actual problem. Maybe people are replacing consoles with their phones just like they're replacing their DSLRs with their phones? "it doesn't support proper advanced network features across all four of the big US carriers." What are these advanced network features? Anyway, I know it's a phone blog, so ... D13H4RD2L1V3 Well, he means that since its successor isn't far off, and that the Pixel is still not easy to get hold of, you might be better off waiting, since the Pixel is also selling at full price still. Edward jh How can the camera be great I mean what about the pixel camera lens flare issue plaguing 1000's of users. Margaritas Ante Porcos Pixel was a disaster. The worst phone for that price. I understand some of you got the Stockholm syndrome. But some of us see the clear picture. Google simply lost this round with both hands down. Dan Yurman My Google Pixel seems to have a mind of its owns. Here's what it does without my asking it - 1. shuts down randomly and has to be restarted by holding the power button and lower end of the volume rocker for about 15 seconds; 2. randomly starts different pieces of software including a suspiciously high frequency of instances of Google Play Music, which I have since disable, 3. Starts the flashlight from the pull down menu if the phone is placed face down on a shiny flat surface, 4 And randomly starts other programs after unlocking the phone with a pin. On the plus side the camera does good work and the phone is easily held in one hand and scrolled with fingers from the same hand while eating hit wings with the other. :-) Ray I'm very glad I read this article. I was on the fence - and almost pulled the trigger the other day but very glad I didn't now. I'll wait for the next gen and hopefully it's a much better piece of kit - and possibly cheaper. lomsha Whaaaat, you don't say. rockon999 My 2015 Moto X PE's display stopped functioning properly and I needed a new device to *function* in my daily life. So I bought a pixel, yesterday. To address your complaints... I never use Bluetooth on a phone, I'm getting a case, I'll hate the speakers (but I really only use headphones), I'm no bezel snob, and finally... waterproofing? My Moto X PE was waterproofed and I can honestly say it never aided me in one single way. Sure, it felt great using the phone in the rain that one time. But I'm fairly certain an encased pixel can survive that. I know it is probably a horrible value, but I really don't want to deal with buying a $200 phone now, selling it later for $100, and then buying a new $900 phone in a few months. I don't have time to constantly be reselling and selling my devices and I don't have a spare $100 to just throw around on a device. Slurms Mckenzie Seriously have been saying most of what this article is about since day one. I have a pixel XL and I've hated it since receiving it. It's not worth what Google asks when everything that is offered can be had for half the money (quick updates not included) for that asking price it should at least offer sd card support which is something even the most basic phones have. I've been using Nexus phones since the beginning (skipped the 6) and the problems with them were expected as it was a budget friendly phone but if you want to charge premium pricing don't use cloth for your ear piece cover, have dual speakers, and for God's sake don't make deals with the devil (Verizon) to lock down MIMO as a carrier specific feature when every damn phone is capable of and and most carriers are as well F*** you Pixel XL you sack of shit what a waste of 800 bucks Rod Best camera Google photos unlimited backup at original resolution Best performance Lowest touch latency of all Android phones "Just" that. micahthomas Basically all you're saying is wait if a new version is going to be released in 6 months. Might as well just say that, doesn't really have anything to do with if it's iPhone or Android. JG I was about to order my mother a 32GB Pixel a week or so ago to replace her Nexus 5X. I recently discovered the glass of its camera lens has a pretty decent crack in it. It doesn't seem to affect pictures - yet... But we're planning a fairly photogenic trip this summer and I figured the Pixel has a better camera and has unlimited free full resolution Google Photos uploads so... But as I was about to click the "Add to Cart" button, I thought we're not all that far from the expected October release of the Pixel 2. I'm sure mom wouldn't mind being a generation behind, but... derk p just replace the housing on hers. i bought a white one but then wanted a blue back... was cheap on ebay and is very easy to snap on and snap off dizel123 Relatively speaking we're not too far from October of next year for the Pixel 3. Or October 2019 for the Pixel 4... toast I never buy Apple, and I never buy Samsung. But both of their hardware just feel slicker than the Pixel. As the article says, knock a few hundred off the price, and I'd be a keen buyer, mainly for the camera and fast OS updates, and Google "Purity". I'll wait and see how the upcoming Moto Z and X phones turn out. Defenestratus It'll be difficult for me to go back to a Google phone after the nightmare that was my 6P. Major Sceptic Availability is no problem in my neck of the woods , and I appreciate the work Google did on the camera as a point and shoot and smooth software , but after looking at the pixels they looked a bit underwhelming in the feature department , and then as mentioned the outrageous​ prices for the pixels I wouldn't go near one . I might add with the smooth software , Google no longer has the Monopoly on as most devices with 7.0 onwards are very good . Rod What feature does it miss? redsoxwin I'm not sure what this person's agenda is, but this is great phone. Strange article. Amie Perry Porter I personally love my Pixel phone. Will Dutton I never cease to be amazed that everyone always thinks that 'the next one will fix it' with android John Quincy Adams Whining about bezels is ignorance. Without bezels, how do you hold it? . ..please, bezel whiners...answer this... gar216 I'm a happy Nexus 6p user. Even prior to launch I couldn't justify upgrading my 7 month old 6p to a Pixel XL. It would have clearly been an upgrade, but I didn't think it was enough of an upgrade for the price. Also... It's kinda ugly. SiliconAddic "The Google Pixel is a notoriously hard phone to get a hold of. Persistent stock issues have plagued Google's first "in-house" handset from day one, and things really are little to no better in the six months since the launch event. " Um BS. Google has ALWAYS his issues with distribution. The Nexus 5 had this issue, the Nexus 6 had this problem, the 6p also had this problem and now the pixel. Google is incompetent when it comes to this. Meanwhile Apple can launch a new phone and you can walk into any of their stores and pick one up. I wanted a Pixel to replace my Nexus 6, could not get one. I ended up with a S7 edge. Google and Nintendo should team up with their inability to ship jack ****. Eric How does this stand to affect the resale value / trade-in value for current pixel owners under project fi? I'm asking as someone who switched to project fi from Verizon prepaid in early January, and has almost been regretting it ever since. I am a quadriplegic in a power wheelchair to whom the pixel with Google Assistant seemed a natural front runner, due to its voice capabilities, and project fi with it's much touted multi Network and Wi-Fi hopping capabilities seemed a good decision as well. Did my due dilligence and the 4G network to all appearances covered me completely, even though I live with my elderly parents in a rural area. The only option available for order at the time was a white Pixel (not XL) and 32gb. I was nervous about the 32 part at the time, but felt comfortable with the infinite backup capability of Google photos. Now, 3 1/2 months later, not only is service spotty, audio crackly despite not being a candidate for replacement under the microphone bug, and Google's customer service... Let us politely say not the most helpful on the issue. I apologize about the length of this comment, (and after reading over it I really should have made it a direct message) but the difference between a phone worth $600 and the phone worth $300 in retail/tradein is quite a big deal to someone like me, and as much as I love my pixel (and admire/fear/respect Google) getting out while the getting is good is starting to sound the smarter move. ( especially after the 180 they made on the 5x.... Grrrrr) Was curious to get an educated opinion on the subject. Thanks again for your ( and anyone else's who has read this far) time and any insight offered! dizel123 Opinion: Even if you can, you probably shouldn't read David Ruddock's articles anymore. Adam Myself having been using the Pixel since day one, I would agree to an extent... Would I go out a purchase a brand new Pixel/Pixel XL for full retail? Of course not! Only because the new iteration is just around the corner. Now, would I go buy a Galaxy S8 or an iPhone 7? No way, wouldn't even consider it! I have switched phones at least every 6 months for the past 3 to 4 years, between Android and iOS operating systems as well... Having said that, the Pixel has been the best phone and best experience that I have had to date! This is the first time that I haven't thought about what phone I want to get next, and to be honest there would have to be significant improvements for me to even get the newest iteration when it comes out this fall. This phone as just been that good. To sum things up... I would not buy the Pixel/Pixel XL right now at full retail cost, I definitely would NOT go out and buy a Galaxy S8 or an iPhone either... If you, like myself, really love the Pixel line and want to get one and don't already own one. I would suggest trying to hold out and get the newest release this fall. It's most definitely worth the wait! D13H4RD2L1V3 Google always seems to have issues with stocking ever since the Nexus days. Pretty embarrassing that it's still hard to get a hold of one after 6 months. Probably due for a small price cut soon, as newer phones roll out. me me yeah I loved Nexus back with Nexus 4, 5, 7. Now the Nexus banner is carried by the likes of Moto G, OnePlus.... H2OSKI So true. The bluetooth issues alone nearly make this phone unusable. Drops and cutout's every 20 seconds. Get this, my Pixel was fine UNTIL Google sent out "the server side" update to fix the Bluetooth issues my phone never had!!! Thanks Google. Mine is going back this week. Great camera crap bluetooth. I take pics occasionally​ but I need to use a bluetooth headset hours a day. Multiple headphones, headsets, and vehicle connections with all the same result...even in safe mode. Fail. Daishi Google shot themselves in the foot when they gussied up an HTC 10 and called it a Pixel. It is just any other Android phone and doesn't have the support behind it to justify the price. Six months along, it should be more than 50% off. William Ross Why the hell is this idiot comparing a 6 month old device to the newer releases? A year in smartphone years is a lifetime. That being said, the pixel still has the best most up to date software bar none! The camera is still among the best if not the best. And, although the 835 is a newer processor, the 821 is no slouch. GTFOH with this garbage article. And, I'll definitely be getting the next Pixel regardless of price. And, I'll sell my original on eBay for a pretty penny. And, this baby has no scratches any where. It's always been in a case and all glass has been protected by Liquid Armor. diggie Pixel is a $650+ phone built like a budget chinese phone. And sorry, Oneplus has Google beat on OS features while keeping "stock" feel. William Ross Oh here we go again with the one plus fans always hating on the pixel. If your phone is so great then why knock the pixel? I just don't get it. Just talk about how great your actual Chinese knockoff is. No need to hate in the Pixel. The one plus has little more than a cult following and mock my words, it'll never be a mainstream device. me me Android Police and a lot of its customers are hating the Pixel. The OnePlus fans just chime in. I own a OP3T. It simply works, yep even Bluetooth. When take tax into account, its about half the price. OnePlus fans biggest concern: price creep upwards. $300 becomes $350 becomes $390 becomes.... Goblin Shark Is this article from April 1st? Absolutely no one with any knowledge of phone tech recommended a Pixel, ever! Underspeced and overpriced, I doubt there's any trouble keeping them in stock they just know nobody wants them so they're not making any. Rod Under-spec'ed? Ok Underperforming? Nope Edgar Morales I honestly don't see what the problem is I purchased my pixel XL and have not to date had any issues whatsoever with it no Bluetooth issues no speaker issues nothing everyone is saying Michael Hannigan Hey, if you get a phone you love and it lasts just under a year, that's good enough. What more do you expect for a few hundred bucks. Appreciate the year you loved that thing and then replace it with a new one that you can love even more. Tom Takumi Okamoto OnePlus is a better phone maker than Google. A company not even 1% worth of Google. I really want a Pixel but it's not practical. Ionut Lala I'm sorry but that is clearly not a first generation device. Not the first from Google (made by HTC and let's not forget about the Nexus line). And not the first from HTC (for obvious reasons). Aquan Belk I wish other Android manufacturers went to stock Android. I know Samsung shines in it's own apps on top of Android but vanilla Android still is and always will be the best. Rod You heard the man, people. Don't buy a Pixel because it will have bad resale value and won't be updated for long. Instead, get a model that will have bad resale value and won't be updated for long, plus has worst performance, buggy software and worse camera performance. You're welcome. Stephonz My last Google phone was Nexus 5. As much as I like pure Android experience, Google has a bigheaded trend in phones. The price point was my biggest no no after the 5X. They don't offer as much features as the other well known Android companies.. amir80 I have a Pixel 32 gb and I really really like it. Everything works great and the camera is amazing and also the battey life. For me, the fingerprint sensor is a must. The S8 sensor is poorly located and the G6 sensor is too small. GeorgeDao123 Absolutely. The Pixel duo are 2 pieces of $#!¶. They run pure Android version and they are so slow to boot up and open apps though they are lag-free. Neru Nexus I've had a pixel since launch day. For one I don't agree with the bluetooth issues. Keep the phone up to date or use the bluetooth connect and play app to automate things. Second it is a over priced phone but so is an iPhone. The main reason real users should get a pixel is the updates. Sure you might need to learn something about that expensive piece of tech you bought and not just sit on your hands waiting for the apples or googles of the world to update your shit, but at least google gave us source code, kernel code and a unlocked bootloader. There are still updates being made for the old nexus 5, that's like 5 years old. Grab iphone 4s and tell me again about how fucking great those updates are lol. You can't even install apps like skype or whatsapp that thing is pooched. I can promise the world that even if google stops updating the pixel in 2018 there will be updated versions of the os you can manually install for years. Let's see if you can get more then one firmware update on your fancy new samsung s8. My money is on 1, then the s9 will launch a year later and samsung just won't care about the s8. rjcuk What if you want a slightly smaller phone? The S8 is 5.8" compared to the Pixel at 5". I really struggle to hold 6" phones. Even the Nexus 5X at 5.2" was too big to grip properly and comfortably. Janoo Ramachandran DON'T BUY A PIXEL. We have 2 Pixels at home. One bought early November 16 and the other end Jan 17. The one I was gifted this January, within 40 days had microphone related issues. I could not hear anyone on the phone, nor was the music being played out. They refused a replacement. My phone sat in the repair centre for 8 plus day and the mother board replaced. Have you ever heard of a new phone device of any other brand needing a mother board replacement in leads than 45 days WELL GOOGLE PHONE PIXEL NEEDED IT. The other phone bought early November 16 started having other issues last month and it wasn't recognizing the wifi. After at least 20 hours on the phone with the terrible google support, it had to be sent to the repair centre where it was kept for 2 weeks, you heard that right 16 days to be precise. Then the phone came back with a chip replaced. SHOULD YOI BUY A PIXEL EVER. :. NEVER SHOULD YOU LOOK AT GOOGLE AS A PHONE MAKER :. NEVER Nikhil I wholeheartedly concur here. I picked up a Pixel sometime around December which had to be promptly returned for a replacement as the volume rocker was rickety. The replacement didn't last long either. Within a month, the widely acknowledged microphone issues popped up and after almost 15 days of talking to the very incompetent Google support in India, their only resolution was to take the Pixel to the service center. The service center did not have the motherboard in stock (they had to bring it all the way from Taiwan) and my phone still languishes there even after 15 days of me submitting it. The phone suffers from not only just Gen-one product issues, but also terrible after sales support. Leonardo Baez Agree.... ait for the next generation THEN buy current generation cheaper. Jeremy Allan Actual customer service? You do realize that owners of a pixel get free 24/7 support any time, on a dedicated line for pixel owners? Exalm There is the same section in the settings on Nexus 5X and 6P. No idea whether it works, since there's no chat or phone support in Russia neither for Nexus nor Pixel. Cory Wilson I agree. Granted it was around a year ago I bought my 6p but the 6p didn't cost $870 either. Still don't regret that decision Impulse_Vigil Haven't really had any serious Pixel Bluetooth issues here... A handful of times (literally less than half a dozen) BT shut itself off back in Feb-March, hasn't happened again since the Play Services patch. I use Bluetooth on a daily 24/7 basis too with my ZenWatch 3, car audio, etc. I don't push it to its range limits tho. Dunno whether David's usage and issue is some sorta edge case, or range related, or whether he was speaking to the 1-2 month period when others were having more severe Bluetooth shut off issues. I do agree with the overall sentiment tho, Google hasn't made it easy to buy the Pixel and that's simply inexcusable. I haven't had to suffer thru any of the QC issues (no BT, mic, whatever issues here, knock on wood) but it seems they weren't handled super well either. To be honest I wouldn't even recommend the S8 to anyone either unless it's another geek/enthusiast, these days for most people it's simply not worth it to spend that kind dosh on a phone. I bought my mother a Moto Z Play; I'd probably point others towards that, the OP3, or an HTC One/S7 on sale. I'm super happy with my Pixel, but if there was a OnePlus 3-class device for Zoglog Having owned a pixel XL and now a s8+, I'd have to agree. Even not taking into account the questionable hardware reliability of the pixel (mine died in 5 months). Basically when I owned the pixel I loved the hell out of stock Android but I kept on wondering why I paid so much for it. Meanwhile with the S8+ the gorgeous screen makes it feel especially special and worth the price. Even though I would prefer stock Android 10000% sebastianer Pixel is just another Nexus. Like the 6P. There is no excuse, this is not their first premium phone. Still made by HTC instead of Huawei. And called Pixel instead of Nexus...and more expensive because of HTC and all the marketing costs. And..still has the shitty compass all their recent previous nexus had with a lot of topics open in Google product forums and staff giving tons of manuals about how to perfect calibrate something that doesn't retain calibration. But the main reason I wouldn't buy a Pixel...is the compass and secondly that you will get one more android update if you wait 6 months. username_not_valid How is the pixel the first 'in-house Google phone'? Its clearly and actually a slightly rehashed HTC. HTC doesn't just make it ,they designed it for all intents and purposes. Unless Googles design strategy happens to be exactly like HTCs then its not a Google phone. The Pixel is just an over priced nexus, nothing else. SOUL- Always great to see the smartphone community go from praising a phone to outright basing it just after a couple of months. Perfectly fine with my Pixel. Michael Sørensen It's just ... really boring. andy mckenzie It's a superb phone , blazing fast so processor is not an issue , amazing camera , free storage , online support has been fast and efficient in my experience, stock Android , I'd highly recommend to anyone. remister I am still using my 6P, I couldn't swallow the 1K price tag for 128GB with insurance.... Justin Field Yeah, I broke the screen on my 5x, and since I am on Fi I considered getting a pixel for about 2 seconds and ordered and new screen and fixed my phone. I will wait for the next gen or switch off of Fi.

(Shutterstock/Castleski) With the recent advances in artificial intelligence, Google has been working to apply a form of high-level AI computing known as deep learning to the field of medicine and health care. Though further developments are underway, Google said Thursday that it has successfully developed new deep learning algorithms that can detect and diagnose diabetic retinopathy, an eye disease which can lead to blindness, as well as locate breast cancer. Lily Peng, product manager of the medical imaging team at Google Research, shared how the US tech giant is using deep learning to train machines to analyze medical images and automatically detect pathological cues, be it swollen blood vessels in the eye or cancerous tumors, during a video conference with the South Korean media hosted by Google Korea. Read also: Blood test offers hope for better lung cancer treatment Based on the workings of the human brain, deep learning uses large artificial neural networks -- layers of interconnected nodes -- that rearrange themselves as new information comes in, allowing computers to self-learn without the need for human programming. “Artificial neural networks have been around since the 1960s. But now with more powerful computing power, we can build more layers into the system to handle more complicated tasks with high accuracy,” Peng said. “In deep learning, the feature engineering is handled by the computer itself. We don’t tell the networks what the feature is, but we give them lots of examples, and have the network itself determine what these features are on their own.” On the medical front, Google has made significant progress on building an algorithm to read retinal scan images to discern signs of diabetic retinopathy, the fastest growing cause of preventable blindness in the world.  Diabetic retinopathy can be detected through regular eye exams. Doctors pictures of patients’ eyes with a special camera and check for the disease based on the amount of visible hemorrhages.

In India, there is a shortage of 127,000 eye doctors while 45 percent of patients suffer vision loss before diagnosis,” said Peng, who is also a clinical scientist. Therefore, Google designed an AI algorithm to analyze retinal images and identify features of diabetic retinopathy. The program was exposed to 128,000 retinal images labeled by 54 ophthalmologists. Labeling took place multiple times for each image to account for diagnostic variability among doctors, it said. As the algorithm has shown high accuracy, Google has now moved to build an interface and hardware into which doctors in India can input a retinal image and immediately receive a grade for diabetic retinopathy. The firm continues to optimize its machine to improve user convenience and plans to conduct more clinical trials to secure regulatory approval, according to Peng. Another field spearheading Google’s deep learning push is cancer detection. The tech giant is developing another deep learning algorithm that surveys biopsy images to locate metastatic breast cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes.

(Google Korea via The Korea Herald/File) “What we’re trying to do is find out where there is a little bit of breast cancer in the lymph node, which helps determine what stage of cancer the patient is in and guides treatment,” Peng said. Google’s AI algorithm achieved a tumor localization score -- how accurately it can locate the cancerous tumor -- of 0.89, exceeding the score of 0.73 from a highly-trained human pathologist with unlimited time for examination. Peng, however, pointed to the algorithm’s shortcomings in its biopsy readings. The algorithm was tested against slides containing 10,000 to 400,000 images, of which 20 to 150,000 showed tumors. Google’s algorithm located tumors with a sensitivity of 92 percent, but this was when set to allow eight false positive readings per slide. On the other hand, human doctors had a locational sensitivity of 73 percent, but zero false positives -- meaning they were less efficient at finding tumors but never identified normal tissue as a tumor.  “If you combine the machine and the pathologist reading the slide, you’d have a very optimal situation where you have low false negative (diagnoses) and high sensitivity (for tumor location),” Peng said. The Google researcher said it will take some time before devices running on Google’s deep learning algorithms are commercialized for use in the medical sector, as it must secure sufficient clinical data proving their efficacy and accuracy before seeking regulatory approval. On concerns that Google’s next-generation medical image analysis tools could be subject to tougher regulations given their novelty, Peng said that the US Food and Drug Administration holds a “neutral” or “objective” approach to the devices, as they fall within an existing product category. The US FDA considers the new devices simply as upgraded versions of existing medical imaging and processing devices that can be approved as long as their claimed functions are backed by sufficient evidence, she said.

Here we look at five things Congress could do in service of closing this loophole. _______________________________ Guest post by Chris Castle of Music Tech Solutions Copyright reform is on the front burner again after the passing of the  Register of Copyrights Selection and Accountability Act by a vote of 378-48.   But there’s another problem the Congress needs to fix that won’t require legislation in the short run:  The mass filing of tens of millions of “address unknown” notices under the archaic compulsory license for songs. I’m going to assume that readers know the general background on the millions of “address unknown” NOIs filed with the Copyright Office under a loophole in the Copyright Act (Sec. 115(c)(1)).   If that is Geek to you, see my recent paper on mass NOIs for more complete analysis (or previous posts on MTS for the armchair version of the story.   The first distinction to remember is that we are only concerned in this post with song copyrights and not the sound recording.  This story implicates songwriters and publishers, not artists and record companies, and it only applies to the government’s compulsory license for songs, a uniquely American invention. In a nutshell, Amazon, Google, Pandora, Spotify and other tech companies are serving on the Copyright Office tens of millions of “address unknown” notices of intention to obtain a compulsory license to make and distribute recordings of certain types of songs.  Under what can only be called a “loophole” in this compulsory license, a service can serve these “address unknown” NOIs on the Copyright Office if the owner is not identifiable in the Copyright Office public records.  The Copyright Office stands in the shoes of the “address unknown” copyright owner to receive and preserve these notices. On the one hand companies like Amazon, Google, Pandora and Spotify say that they can’t find these millions of song owners, while at the same time at least some of the same companies brag about how comprehensive and expensive their song databases are (like Google’s Content ID) or their agents puff up the agent’s own massively complete song databases as “the worlds largest independent database of music copyright and related business information.”  And yet, these same companies and their agents can’t seem to find songwriters whose names, repertoire and contact information are well known, or whom they already pay through their own systems or through their agent. The Database Double Loophole Trick Here’s the loophole.  First, the loophole requires a very narrow reading of Section 115(c)(1) of the Copyright Act, a 40 year old statute being applied to NOIs served at a scale the Congress never intended.  If the song owner isn’t found in the public records of the Copyright Office, even if the digital service or its agent has actual knowledge of the song copyright owner’s whereabouts, the digital service can say they are not required to look further. Even if you buy into this willful blindness, these digital services may not be looking at the complete public records of the Copyright Office.  The only digitized records of the Copyright Office are from January 1, 1978 forward, and my bet is those easily searchable records are the only records the services consult.  That omits the songs of Duke Ellington, Otis Redding, The Beatles and five Eagles albums not to mention a very large chunk of American culture. The Copyright Office records from before 1978 are available on paper, so the pre-78 songs are still in the public records (which is what the Congress contemplated in the Copyright Act). The identifiers are just not “there” if you decide not to look for them.  However, it is not metaphysical, it is metadata that exists in physical form.  This is the “double loophole”. The Double Triple:  New Releases Another category of song copyrights that will never be in the public records of the Copyright Office in their initial release window are new releases with recently filed but not yet finalized copyright registrations.  The Copyright Office itself acknowledges that it can take upwards of a year to process new copyright registrations.  This allows “address unknown” filers to bootstrap a free ride on the back of Congress during that one-year period. No Liability or Royalties Either:  Trebles All Round Once a company serves the “address unknown” NOI on the Copyright Office, songwriters are arguably compelled by the government to permit the service to use their songs.  Filing the “address unknown” NOI arguably allows the service to avoid liability for infringement and also–adding insult to injury–to avoid paying royalties.  If the NOI is properly filed, of course. In current practice, a mass “address unknown” NOI is usually a single notice of intention filed with a huge attachment of song titles with the required fields, such as this one Google filed for Sting’s “Fragile”, the anthem of the environmental movement (which was clearly filed incorrectly as the song was registered long ago): The number of mass “address unknown” NOIs being posted by the Copyright Office on an almost daily basis suggests that tech companies now view mass “address unknown” NOIs as the primary way to put one over on songwriters and the Congress, too.  Companies like Amazon, Spotify, Google, Pandora and others are using this heretofore largely unused loophole on a scale that flies in the face of Chairman Goodlatte’s many hearings in the last session of Congress on updating the Copyright Act. This “address unknown” practice also undermines the efforts of Chairman Goodlatte and Ranking Member Conyers to modernize the Copyright Office.  Indeed, based on the very lopsided vote on HR 1695 the Register of Copyrights Selection and Accountability Act, it is clearly the desire of the overwhelming majority of Members of Congress, too. What Can Be Done? Congress can play a role in in providing immediate relief to songwriters by stopping the mass “address unknown” NOIs or at least requiring the Library of Congress and the Copyright Office to take steps to verify the NOIs are filed correctly. At the moment, the government takes away property rights from the songwriters by means of the compulsory license without taking even rudimentary steps to assure the public that the “address unknown” NOI process is being implemented correctly and transparently. Here are five steps the Congress can take to rectify this awful situation.  Stop Selling Incomplete Data:  Congress should instruct the Library of Congress to stop selling the post 1978 database until due diligence can be performed on the database to determine if it is even internally correct.  It appears that many if not all the mass “address unknown” NOI filers use the LOC database to create their NOIs.  It is also highly unlikely that this database will include new releases.  Congress can simply instruct the Librarian to stop selling the database.  Stop Accepting “Address Unknown” NOIs With Compressed File Attachments: Congress should instruct the Library of Congress and the Copyright Office to immediately cease accepting “address unknown” NOIs with compressed files as attachments for what appears to be a single NOI.  These compressed files are so large in most cases that songwriter can never uncompress them on a home computer to determine if their songs are subject to “address unknown” NOIs.  Google in particular is a major offender of filing huge compressed files.  Each compressed file contains tens of thousands of song titles.  Require Accounting Compliance with Copyright Office Regulations:  Long standing regulations require that anyone relying on an NOI must file mostly and annual statements of account reflecting usage of the songs subject to the NOIs.  The tech companies serving mass NOIs are not rendering these statements and thus fail to comply with the transparency requirements of Copyright Act.  All of the “address unknown” NOIs served during 2016 are out of compliance with the regulations, and all “address unknown” NOIs served in the first quarter of 2017 are likewise out of compliance.  Congress should instruct the Copyright Office to require monthly and annual statements of account be filed with the Copyright Office for anyone who has relied on these NOIs as required by the regulations.  All statements of account should be certified in the normal course as required by the regulations, and made available to the public by posting to the Copyright Office website. Require the Library of Congress to Create a Searchable Database of NOIs:Congress should instruct the Library of Congress to create a single database maintained online that is maintained by an independent third party and is searchable by songwriters in a manner similar to a state unclaimed property office.  That database needs to be updated on a regular schedule.  Given the size of the compressed files served to date, it is essentially impossible for songwriters to determine if NOIs have been filed on their songs.  This is particularly true as the NOIs are served on an effectively random basis, so even if songwriters were able to search, they would essentially have to search all the time.  Pay Royalties Into A Permanent Trust Account:  Given that it is highly likely that the mass NOIs filed to date have a significant number of errors, it is also likely that songwriters will become entitled to payment of royalties retroactively if these errors are ever caught.  Therefore, the Congress should require that royalties should be paid to a trust account maintained at the Copyright Office and held in perpetuity like a state unclaimed property office.  Of course, it is equally likely that the song copyright owners will be entitled to terminate any purported license under 17 USC Sec. 115(c)(6).  These payments should be based on actual usage and not black box.  This is another reason why the statements for “address unknown” NOIs should be public. What started in April 2016 as a trickle of NOIs from a handful of companies has now expanded exponentially.  Based on Rightscorp’s analysis in January 2017, some 30 million “address unknown” NOIs had been filed–and that did not include the dozens of “address unknown” NOIs filed by Spotify in March 2017 alone which themselves likely total over a million songs. NOI Table   Top Three Services Filing NOIs April, 2016-January 2017 Number of NOIs Per Service Amazon Digital Services LLC 19,421,902 Google, Inc. 4,625,521 Pandora Media, Inc. 1,193,346 It is rapidly becoming standard practice for tech companies to try to pull the wool over the eyes of the Congress by leveraging an apparent loophole and they are doing it on a grand scale. As we have seen with everything else they touch from the DMCA to royalty audits, the tech companies will continue this loophole-seeking behavior until they are forced to stop.  Since no one at the Library of Congress seems to have the appetite to right this wrong, the Congress itself must step in. Ultimately Congress should fix the loophole through legislation, but in the meantime most of the harms can be corrected overnight by policy changes alone.

The Amazon Echo ignited a smart speaker craze, with even Google jumping on board with its own Google Home. So, of course it didn't take long for reports to emerge about Apple making its own device powered by Siri. Now, according to reliable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo (via 9to5Mac), Apple will announce this Siri smart speaker at its annual developer conference this June. Apple will likely market it as a high-end speaker with built-in Siri and superior sound quality and computing power when compared to Amazon Echo and Google Home. The Siri speaker should go on sale by Christmastime, even if it's not announced announced at WWDC 2017. We think it makes sense for Apple to unveil it this summer, giving developers the chance to build apps for the device. Curved OLED iPhone 8 confirmed by Samsung?

Much of this interest, however, is stuck in the prototype stage because most hardware platforms are prototypes and many of the tools needed to build the killer app to move into production are still under development. Vuforia adds an important piece to the AR toolchain puzzle, though, with its announcement today of Smart Terrain for Google’s Tango tablet. Smart Terrain, announced in conjunction with Google and Unity3D during the opening keynote at the Vision VR/ AR Summit, builds on two mature components of AR: Vuforia’s early experience solving a very specific AR development problem and Google Tango, which looks like the first AR platform ready to emerge from prototype status and become a mainstream platform. Vuforia started working on solving the problem of how to create content that interacts with the AR device’s sensors to augment the reality in the user's field of view with dynamic content. One of the AR apps most familiar to consumers is Wayfair’s interior design app that lets users overlay rooms in reality with virtual designs, dropping virtual objects such as furniture into the field of view to see an accurate and realistic rendering of the object in the room. Vuforia builds on this concept, with one significant difference, the objects can be dynamic. The best way to explain the capability is with this short 1-minute, 33-second video by Vuforia. Though the demo leaves the impression that Smart Terrain is a game development tool, it could be used for enterprise applications such as step-by-step technician instructions. Developers can build Star Wars Holochess that interacts with the environment Dynamic content, effects and animated objects can be developed and added to the field of view that accurately interacts with the objects and planes in reality. The Star Wars Holochess game created by animating digitally rendered physical models for the movies a New Hope and the Force Awakens (seen in the 32-second video below) can now be built with Vuforia’s software developer kit (SDK). A Holochess-like game was built by Star Wars animator Phil Tippett using Vuforia’s old SDK. The difference is today, the characters' animation will not be limited to the table, but can move throughout the 3D space of the room and interact with planes, walls and other physical objects. How Smart Terrain works The problem of overlaying dynamic objects into reality is not new to Vuforia. The engineering team started working on the problem as a Qualcomm business unit a couple years ago. They were building conceptually the same features into Smart Terrain based on the PrimeSense’s depth sensing and acquisition chip. But Apple acquired PrimeSense, locking up the depth-sensing technology and posing an obstacle to the Vuforia’s project. After PTC acquired Vuforia, the Qualcomm strategy pivoted from building software and components that run on every mobile device to building enabling software for other companies’ platforms. The Tango platform represented by the Asus Zenfone AR and the Lenovo Phab 2 is the right entry point because the hardware is in its third design iteration. Tango’s sensors provide a high-fidelity point cloud, relative x, y and z coordinates of the physical space in the field of view. Vuforia’s Smart Terrain SDK computes a scene graph from the point cloud in real time. The scene graph is a hierarchy of real and virtual objects. In the video above, the tabletop is the parent node, the playing card is a child node, and the animated characters, effects and physical interactions with other objects are another child node. Content such as the animation in the video demo is launched when the SDK has been programmed to recognize something in the field of view, such as a pattern on a flat surface, the geometry of a scanned object or a Vumark (which is any graphic the developer designs to trigger the content launch). Vuforia chose conventional computer vision techniques for its object recognition because it is mature and works well with the Tango time of flight sensors to create a high-fidelity and accurate perspective of reality. Interaction with the field of view rendered by the SDK has 6 degrees of freedom (6DoF). 6DoF translates the field of view along the three perpendicular axes to match the change of orientation of the Tango device held by the user. For example, if an object like the helicopter in the video demo flew up and out of the field of view, tilting the Tango device upward and looking through it would regain the view of the object. Smart Terrain, a developer’s perspective Developers have a few implementation choices. The Smart Terrain is integrated into the lingua franca of AR and VR development, the Unity3D AR and VR authoring platform. Unit3D will provide cross-platform compatibility for Android, the Hololens and iOS/ Xcode. The SDK also address a big hole in the AR toolchain. Developers have two choices when building AR apps. Either they build an app with Unity3D, which are very high-level authoring tools, or they build a native app using C++ and graphics libraries such as OpenGL or Vulkan. The later is very difficult because such skills are rare in the developer community. Although authoring tools, such as Unity3D, are very comprehensive development tools, sometimes developers have a problem that has not been envisioned by the tool makers and for a variety of reasons, cannot use a highly abstracted tool authoring tool. Integration of the SDK into Android Studio for Tango devices and rumored Tango headsets, Microsoft Visual Studio for the Hololens and iOS Xcode simplify the development of these apps because developers can build using familiar languages, such as Java in the case of Android, C## for the Hololens and Swift for iOS. The 40,000 apps built with Vuforia’s library and about the same number of apps in development means developer familiarity will help developers adopt the new Tango-based capability. Vuforia President Jay Wright told me they will release a Microsoft Hololens version. Though he stressed cross-platform support, he did not mention a target date for an iOS AR device.

As companies restructure, some workers will be displaced. The unemployment rate, which has crept up to 2.3 per cent, is likely to rise further, but workers will get help to find replacement jobs and upgrade their skills, he said. Below is an edited excerpt of his speech. Today, I would like to explain some of what we are doing to continue to prosper. It comes down to three things - jobs, jobs and jobs. Three different ways of thinking about jobs. One, creating new jobs by bringing in new businesses and investments, and expanding existing businesses. Two, finding replacement jobs for workers who have lost their jobs or are out of work, and need work. Thirdly, jobs for future workers. Training students and training workers to grow in their jobs. To do something different, bigger, and more productive in the future. First of all, we are helping businesses to create new jobs, new companies, new investments; upgrading and expansion of existing companies. That has been our winning formula for 50 years because if we do not have the new companies, if we do not have a business-friendly environment where people want to come, there will be no new jobs. The Economic Development Board has been working hard to get multinational corporations to invest in Singapore. Let me give you a sample of projects we have opened recently. In electronics, Micron invested $5.4 billion and expanded its fabrication plant at North Coast Drive - 500 jobs. In IT, Google opened a new campus in Mapletree Business City: 1,000 Googlers there. Google is also training 1,000 small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) business leaders on how SMEs can go digital, so helping to transform the economy. In chemicals, it is a mixed picture. Some plants consolidating but others expanding, investing and we are still getting new projects. Evonik broke ground for their second plant on Jurong Island to provide methionine, an amino acid for animal feed - an $800 million investment, 150 jobs. Mr Lee Hsien Loong said that the Government is creating new jobs by bringing in new businesses and investments, and expanding existing businesses. It is also finding replacement jobs for those who have lost their jobs or are out of work. And it is training students and training workers to grow in their jobs. ST PHOTO: LAU FOOK KONG At the same time, we are helping SMEs upgrade themselves, go overseas, expand, and build new capabilities; not just the high-tech companies, but also traditional companies. At one National Day Rally, I talked about bak kwa in Ginza. Today, let me tell you about a Singaporean company called Grandluxe. It was started 75 years ago - in 1942 - as a bookbinding workshop along Mohamed Sultan Road. People used to send reports and papers to such workshops to be bound into volumes, with hard covers or even leather bound. Workers would do this by hand. Grandluxe expanded into the printing business, set up a factory in Jurong, printing stationery, notebooks; but now with the Internet, reports are published online. Nobody binds old reports anymore. And with smartphones, people buy fewer diaries and notebooks. The old business was shrinking. The company decided to change their business model. They turned bookbinding into a premium craft and started a new company called Bynd Artisan - no longer a printing and binding factory but a retail experience. A customer goes to the shop, picks his materials, and skilled bookbinders will personalise a beautiful leather-bound notebook for you. You can watch them working, and admire their skills. Bynd Artisan is now doing well, selling to the world. This has given long-time employees like Ms Tan Buay Heng a new lease of life. Forty years ago, she started as a production operator, manually binding books. Today, she is a craftsman, personalising leather notebooks for customers, conducting workshops and training younger craftsmen. And she is now also managing a retail branch! What Bynd Artisan has accomplished, Spring Singapore and IE Singapore are helping other SMEs to do, to reinvent themselves and find new niches where they can grow. Ms Tan Buay Heng's story - from production operator to retail branch manager - can become the story of other workers. REPLACEMENT JOBS Second, we are helping workers who lose their jobs find alternative jobs, especially professionals, managers, executives and technicians (PMETs). Because businesses have to restructure to survive, and because technology is disrupting everything, we have redundancies even as our economy grows. We are particularly concerned about sectors which are not doing so well. We have expanded several schemes under Adapt and Grow - professional conversion programme (PCP), career support programme for our PMETs, and enhanced work trial support for the rank and file. An alphabet soup of programmes. Brother (Lim) Swee Say is trying all sorts of things. Let me illustrate what we are doing with actual examples, told to me by union leaders and U Associates. Brother Mah Cheong Fatt (executive secretary of Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering Employees' Union) is from the offshore and marine industry. The industry is experiencing tough times now. For the last two years, no new orders. From the last peak, offshore and marine have lost about 30,000 jobs. Foreign workers were the first to be let go, so our own workers did not bear the brunt of the redundancies. But some local workers have also been affected; last year, about 1,000; this year, we are looking at another few hundred. Foreign workers who lose jobs can go back to their home countries. For local workers, this is home. What do we do for our brothers and sisters? Our first priority is to help them find another job. With the offshore and marine industry as it is, it is difficult to find replacement jobs in the same sector, but other sectors like transport and aviation are growing, and need workers with similar skills. They can take the engineers from offshore and marine, with some retraining. So sister Sylvia Choo, who is the executive secretary of Singapore Industrial and Services Employees' Union, and brother Edwin Khew, who is the president of the Institute of Engineers Singapore, are working with brother Cheong Fatt to organise job fairs to help offshore and marine workers find new jobs in aerospace and transport engineering. It is a bold move for workers to switch to a new industry but some are willing to try and have succeeded. This is not just about schemes and programmes, but walking with workers every step of the way. We organise job fairs, set up stalls, and give out pamphlets. But we also go beyond that. Brother Desmond Choo told me about a recent job fair he organised at Our Tampines Hub - very successful, 750 showed up. At the fair, he noticed one person walking around the stalls for some time, seemingly lost. He went three rounds, but didn't talk to anyone. So Desmond went up to him and asked: what is the matter? You have not stopped anywhere. The man said he was lost and did not know what job will fit him. So Desmond counselled him, found out he was a shipyard material handler and matched him with a laundry operator. What Desmond did, is what we want to do for every displaced worker. Each one is an individual, our brother or sister, not a statistic. And this is what the labour movement is about - why brother (Chan) Chun Sing calls NTUC an "unusual labour movement". NTUC takes care of those who have jobs, and helps them keep their jobs. For those who have lost their jobs, NTUC helps them get replacement jobs. For those who are still in school, NTUC works with the Government and business to keep this economy going so they will have jobs when they graduate. Unions elsewhere don't think about the jobless, and especially the young who have yet to enter the job market. In many countries, youth unemployment rose after the financial crisis, and has stayed stubbornly high. And among those who are working, many are underemployed. Even in South Korea and Taiwan, with economies similar to ours, many young people have either given up looking for jobs or taken on part-time work. Yet, in Singapore our youth unemployment rate remains low. Once you graduate, whether from Institute of Technical Education (ITE), polytechnics or universities, you can find a job quite easily. That did not happen by accident. It is because we make sure our schools prepare our young properly for the job market. ITE, polytechnics and universities emphasise on-the-job training, and work with employers to tailor the curriculum and internship programmes. NTUC is also engaging new graduates to set them on the right path. It has set up the NTUC Youth Career Network which mentors youth by offering career guidance and prepares them for job applications. In fact, we have a NTUC-PA Youth Career Network Skills Marketplace here, which I hope you will visit after the rally. The network has attracted many passionate volunteers. Sister Zuhaina is one of them. She has been coaching mentees, polishing up their CVs, preparing them for interviews, giving them confidence to pursue their interests. I thank volunteers like Zuhaina - she embodies the spirit of helping each other succeed. Similarly, we are creating many opportunities for all our workers, young and not-so-young, so do not stop looking and trying! But please - be open-minded and flexible. Be willing to try something new - not just new jobs with new employers, but also new careers in different industries. Take up courses, reskill. If you receive a job offer, please consider it. It will not be an easy process but we are walking this journey with you. We also need employers to come on board - do not just recruit new graduates, give mature workers a second chance. Older workers bring with them maturity and experience. The public sector is leading by example. We are expanding our Adapt and Grow scheme. Many government agencies - Land Transport Authority, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Health - have been hiring mid-career PMETs, including mature workers. We have launched several PCPs to convert mid-career workers and we will do more, especially for the mature ones. So I urge employers: work with us. Unions are doing their part; so must you. The Ministry of Manpower can develop PCPs for both entry-level and mid-level jobs, and support employers with reskilling programmes. The Government will pay a good portion of the wages of the workers you take on during the conversion period. If the tripartite partners pull together, we will transform together, adapt together and grow together. GROWING IN JOBS Third, we are supporting all our workers to grow in their jobs, that is, upgrading them. We must take worker upgrading very seriously. Workers in other countries know they need to keep on learning to keep their rice bowls; they are hungry. Brothers Hock Poh and Arasu, and sister Jessie recently discovered how hungry they are when they went to Chengdu to visit smart factories. These were highly automated plants, not sweatshops, no shop floors full of workers operating machines. Now, one worker oversees 20 machines, troubleshooting when necessary. However, it was not the machines, but the workers who left a deeper impression on them. The Chinese workers work hard and train hard; they live in dorms, and at night in their spare time, they log on to their accounts and do e-learning. So workers in other countries are constantly upgrading. We had better put in as great an effort or more. If we think that we do not have to push ourselves further, that we do not have to work hard, we are kidding ourselves. That is why we have been working so hard on SkillsFuture. The good news is we have a good head start. The International Monetary Fund considers SkillsFuture one of the most comprehensive skills development programmes it has seen. Last year, I had a dialogue with Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) students, and met several mature students who have been upgrading. One of them was Adelene Teck. She worked as an occupational therapist for 20 years and decided to upgrade herself at SIT. As a mature student, she told me her classmates are like her children! I asked SIT how she is doing. They tell me Adelene is about to finish her one-year programme, and looking forward to going back to work to apply her new skills. That is what all of us need to do - we are never too old to learn! These are our plans to transform our economy and grow our jobs. At the centre of this effort are our Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs). They were a major Committee on the Future Economy (CFE) recommendation. We are going industry by industry, focusing on specific things we can do in each industry, coming up with well-thought-out plans to upgrade and improve. Through ITMs, businesses can stay viable and thrive - and keep the jobs they have and create new ones. For example, the logistics industry. It is a big contributor to our economy; together with transport, it employs nearly 250,000 workers. The prospects are bright because of technology, robotics and data analytics. NTUC is in this too, through FairPrice. FairPrice's new distribution centre is equipped with an Automated Storage and Caddy Pick System, the first such system in the Asia-Pacific. Many other logistics companies are expanding. We intend to create another 2,000 PMET jobs in logistics in the next five years! But to do that, everyone will have to play his part. Employers must invest in technology, train up workers, unions must work with employers, identify where the new jobs will be, and help workers get new skills. And the Government will support companies to adopt new technology and workers to get training. This is tripartism in action. And it is not just logistics which will have an ITM. We are doing this for many different sectors, 23 in all, covering a large part of our economy, 80 per cent! We are going to take this one step further. Last year we set up a tripartite council, the Council for Skills, Innovation and Productivity. The council was chaired by brother Tharman (Shanmugaratnam), who was leading the SkillsFuture effort. Since then the CFE, led by brothers (Heng) Swee Keat and (S.) Iswaran, has completed its report. It is a comprehensive plan to take our economy the next step forward. Now we need to implement the CFE's recommendations, including the ITMs, to make the transformation happen. I have asked brother Swee Keat to take over from Deputy Prime Minister Tharman as chair of council. We will rename it the Future Economy Council. Swee Keat will work with brothers Iswaran, Chun Sing, (Ong) Ye Kung, Lawrence (Wong), and other ministers and ministers of state, especially the younger ones. I am putting them in charge of this strategic effort. It is a deep transformation which will extend beyond this term of government. It is an opportunity for them to work closely together as a team, strengthen their bonds with employers and unions, and with each other, and show Singaporeans what they can do. It is their generation of leadership who will have to work with you to take this country to new heights. Our unique tripartite partnership is the secret to why we have been able to transform our economy over and over again. Starting from our nation-building years when we had to industrialise, through the British withdrawal from their bases here in 1971, when we were faced with the prospect of tens of thousands of Singaporeans losing their jobs; through our first major recession in 1985, when workers had to accept deep Central Provident Fund cuts to reduce business costs; through the Asian Financial Crisis, Sars, the dot.com bubble bust, the global financial crisis. Each time the challenges we faced seemed daunting, sometimes even overwhelming. But each time we pulled together, adjusted course, made sacrifices, helped each other, and forged ahead. We will no doubt face further challenges ahead, even severe ones but if we strengthen our tripartite system, and remain united, if the labour movement remains strong, to take care of our workers and give them a sense that they are co-owners in our system, if all segments of society - workers as well as employers, managers and professionals as well as foremen and the rank and file - sacrifice equally when sacrifice is called for, and share in the fruits of success when we do well, I am confident we will overcome the challenges and emerge stronger. Each one of us, with one another for one another, for Singapore. That is the way we make sure that every May Day we will have good reason to celebrate. That is the way we can make good things happen and create a bright future for our children.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Nobody Can Stop Facebook and Google The two ad giants combined to take nearly all of the growth in U.S. digital ad spend. Adam Levy (TMFnCaffeine) May 1, 2017 at 6:40PM It's well known that digital advertising is a megatrend fueling the growth of companies like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), the parent company of Google. IAB estimates U.S. ad spend grew nearly 22% last year. eMarketer expects the market to grow another 16% this year, reaching $83 billion. But investors expecting to reap rewards from the trend by investing in a smaller digital advertising platform besides Facebook or Google may be missing out. An analysis of IAB's annual report by Pivotal Research shows the two advertising giants accounted for 99% of the growth in U.S. digital ad spending. Everybody else combined to just stand still. Image source: Google. They can't be stopped There's really only one reason why Facebook and Google keep growing faster than the rest of the market: People keep spending more time using their sites and apps. Facebook is a dominant force in display advertising, which accounted for 44% of U.S. digital ad spend last year, a total of $31.7 billion. That's up 29% year over year, as it accounted for a larger piece of the market than 2015. For reference, Facebook's ad revenue grew 61.7% year over year in 2016. That's more than twice as fast as the overall display ad market. Facebook users spend an average of 50 minutes per day between Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger. And there's 1.9 billion of them. Importantly, those numbers are still growing. Facebook's last update of 50 minutes per day was about a year ago, but it was up from 40 minutes just nine months prior. Facebook's 1.9 billion monthly active users is up 16.9% from the end of last year. Likewise, Google is the platform to buy search advertising. Google is benefiting greatly from the growth of smartphones and the increasing size of the data buckets wireless companies offer. There's practically nothing stopping people from taking out their phone to Google something really quickly, no matter where they are, or what they're doing. As a result, Google is benefiting from a significant increase in searches per user. And as the only game in town -- at least the only one that matters -- Google is seeing a steady increase in search ad revenue. Google is also benefiting from the ever-growing popularity of YouTube, and its display ad network revenue continues to grow modestly. Image source: Facebook Even more dominant on mobile Both Facebook and Google are even more dominant on mobile devices. As mentioned, Google is benefiting from a growth in mobile searches. In fact, mobile searches may be eating into desktop searches. IAB estimates desktop search advertising fell 13% last year, but mobile search advertising increased 91%. Google takes about 95% of all searches on mobile, but just about 63% on desktops. As more searches shift to mobile, Google stands to gain even more share of the market. Facebook, likewise, is the most dominant app on mobile devices. Users are spending more and more time in apps these days, reaching five hours per day in the fourth quarter last year, according to Flurry Analytics. Total time spent in apps was up 69% year over year. The biggest contributing factor was messaging and social apps, which grew nearly fivefold  in 2016. Flurry says Facebook managed to take 19% of those five hours, nearly one hour on its own. Add to that the time spent in Instagram, and it's absolutely dominating the time users spend on mobile. These trends aren't slowing down. Mobile ads accounted for 51% of ad spend last year compared to just 35% in 2015. As more ad spending shifts to mobile, the strength of Facebook and Google will only continue to benefit, while everyone else collectively struggles to tread water.

Online advertising has overtaken television to become the world’s largest ad medium, according to data and analysis agency Zenith. Twitter is the fastest-growing media owner, increasing ad revenue by 734% between 2012 and 2016. Internet-only media companies are grabbing the biggest slices of the online advertising market, while traditional news publishers have fallen far behind and been forced to make cutbacks. Google, owned by parent company Alphabet, is by far the biggest media owner in the world and attracted $79.4bn (£61.5bn) in ad revenues in 2016, three times more than the second-largest, Facebook, which pulled in $26.9bn, according to Zenith. The previous year, Alphabet took $67.4bn of ad revenues and Facebook $17.1bn. Together, the two companies accounted for nearly 20% of global advertising spending last year, up from 16.3% in 2015 and 10.6% in 2012. The largest traditional media owner is US broadcasting and cable television company Comcast, which was third with $12.9bn in ad revenues in 2016, up from $11.5bn the year before. Despite its large share of the ad market, Google faces a growing boycott from major advertisers including the UK government, Marks & Spencer and McDonald’s, and has promised an overhaul of its advertising policies. Many of the companies involved in the boycott discovered their advertising spend was being used to place banner ads over YouTube videos from groups such as Britain First, indirectly funding extremists. Digital platforms funded by internet ads dominate the top 30. Aside from Alphabet and Facebook, there are five pure internet media owners in the ranking: Baidu, Microsoft, Yahoo, Verizon and Twitter. Between them, the seven digital platforms generated $132.8bn of internet ad revenues in 2016, accounting for nearly three-quarters of all internet ad spend, and nearly one-quarter of total ad spending. Verizon became a media owner in 2015 when it bought AOL, and is set to become a much larger one when it acquires Yahoo later this year, which will catapult the wireless telecommunications group from 21st to sixth. Most of the media owners in the ranking – 20 out of 30 – are based in the US. The US dominates for several reasons: it has the biggest ad market, US companies have invested the most in extending their reach abroad and Silicon Valley innovation has powered the growth of internet advertising. China and Germany each have three media owners in the ranking: Baidu, Tencent and CCTV for China, and Bertelsmann, ProSiebenSat.1 and Axel Springer for Germany. There are four countries with one media owner each: the UK (ITV), France (JCDecaux), Brazil (Grupo Globo) and Italy (Mediaset). Jonathan Barnard, the head of forecasting at Zenith, said: “Zenith’s new ranking demonstrates just how much the internet advertising platforms are setting the pace for global ad spend growth. Google and Facebook alone have accounted for almost two-thirds of global ad spend growth since 2012.” Topics Advertising Google Facebook Social networking Alphabet Digital media news Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content most viewed The Guardian back to top home US politics world opinion sports soccer tech arts lifestyle fashion business travel environment all sections close home US politics world UK europe americas asia middle east africa australia cities development opinion sports soccer MLS NFL MLB NBA NHL soccer live scores tables competitions results fixtures clubs tech arts movies tv & radio music games books art & design stage classical lifestyle food recipes health & fitness love & sex family women home & garden fashion business economics sustainable business diversity & equality in business small business travel USA europe UK environment climate change wildlife energy pollution science media selected crosswords blog editor quick cryptic prize quiptic genius speedy everyman azed weekend video Media › Advertising back to top UK UK politics education media society law scotland Facebook Twitter jobs guardian labs subscribe all topics all contributors solve technical issue about us advertise with us contact us work for us complaints & corrections terms & conditions privacy policy cookie policy securedrop © 2017 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

This is especially true when you type quickly without tapping on the suggestion that appears at the top of the keyboard. We will show you how to fix Galaxy S8 autocorrect problems by changing your keyboard settings and installing a better Galaxy S8 keyboard on your phone that will automatically use the autocorrect, instead of making you tap again to use the right word. Read: 15 Common Galaxy S8 Problems & How to Fix Them If you are coming from another Android phone or from the iPhone this will help you type faster and better on the Galaxy S8. How to Fix Galaxy S8 Autocorrect Problems How to fix Galaxy S8 autocorrect problems. The first thing you can do is make sure that your Galaxy S8 autocorrect settings are configured properly. By default, they should include autocorrect support, but not spellchecking. With the keyboard on the screen, tap and hold on the microphone, then tap on the settings button. Now tap the button on the right to turn on Spell check. With Spell Check and Autocorrect on, you will see options to type better, but you need to tap on the words to send the autocorrected version and you also need to tap on misspelled words to fix them. How to improve Galaxy S8 autocorrect. This means if you are quickly typing a message and then tapping send like you can on an iPhone, you can easily send a garbled message that not even you understand. Instead, you should install a better Android keyboard that will automatically fix the words as you type. With the Google Gboard installed, you can enter the autocorrected word by pressing the space bar instead of pausing to tap on the top. Download Google Gboard to your Galaxy S8. This is a free app on the Google Play Store and as the name suggests it is made by Google. The best way to fix Galaxy S8 autocorrect problems is with Gboard. Open the app and follow the directions to install the keyboard. This will ask you to turn on the keyboard in the Galaxy S8 keyboard settings. You will see a warning that this keyboard can collect your text, except for passwords and credit card numbers. This is a legit app from Google so there is no need to worry about nefarious purposes. On the next screen, tap on English (US) Gboard. You will then be prompted to allow access to your contacts, which allows you to turn on an option to suggest contact names. Unlike the Samsung keyboard, when you tap the spacebar, it will insert the autocorrected word instead of the mistyped word. This will fix most GalaxyS 8 autocorrect problems without spending any money or changing how you type. One downside to this is that you no longer have the top number bar available at the top of the keyboard, but for better autocorrect on the Galaxy S8 it is a trade off we will gladly make. 20 Best Galaxy S8+ Cases Samsung Suede-like Case   1 / 20 This year Samsung debuted the Alcantara case.

Opinion: Even if you can, you probably shouldn't buy a Google Pixel anymore David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/05/01 2:09pm PDTMay 1, 2017 66 Plus 1 on G+ 263 Share on Facebook 60 Share on Twitter Total Shares389 Editorials Pixel Pixel XL The Google Pixel is a notoriously hard phone to get a hold of. Persistent stock issues have plagued Google's first "in-house" handset from day one, and things really are little to no better six months after the launch event. Honestly, it's a bit embarrassing just how consistently incompetent Google seems to be at keeping a reasonable inventory of phones available for purchase. But setting that aside, as one of the Pixel's most ardent evangelists, I think there's something it's probably time for me to come clean on: Even if you could buy a Pixel today, I really think you shouldn't. The Pixel is a product with generation-one product issues. The Bluetooth performance is horrid. It's not waterproof. The bezels really are due for a shrink. I don't think the exterior coating on the black and blue variants is of a particularly high quality. The glass window gets scuffed up incredibly easily. The Snapdragon 821 is officially old news. And it doesn't support proper advanced network features across all four of the big US carriers. There are other flaws I could point to, and while none of them are too terrible, they do speak to the slightly-rushed development cycle this phone seems to have been subjected to. Sure, Google got some things astoundingly right: the performance, the camera, the larger software experience. In fact, I think the Pixel is easily the best Android smartphone ever for these strengths, at least if we're talking about me personally as a user (your mileage, obviously, may vary). But for all the great, smooth, fast, clean, pure, simple, natural, and various other adjective-members singing in the Pixel-praise cavalcade, this phone is not the one to buy right now. For starters, Google continues to ask what is an increasingly laughable amount of money for the model most of us want - the 128GB XL - at a staggering $870. Sure, Apple charges the same for an iPhone 7 Plus 128GB, but I'm under no illusion that this comparison in any way favors Google. The iPhone comes with Apple customer service (with actual stores), a longer software support period going forward, and runs no real risk of poor resale value. The Pixel? Google's online support is iffy at best, we know the phone will be unsupported by October 2018, and I have a strong feeling generation-one Pixel resale values will drop like a rock once the new phones are announced. And that really is why, if you haven't pulled the trigger on a Pixel yet, you should just wait. It's overpriced, under-supported, and competing phones like the Galaxy S8 offer a whole lot more technology for your money. The Galaxy S8+ is $20 less than a 128GB Pixel XL, and I would argue it is far and away the better smartphone value. That amazing display, brand-new Snapdragon 835 processor, jaw-dropping design and packaging, and the full support of all our American carriers' latest LTE advancements could each be a reason on its own to put the Galaxy S8 above Google's smartphone. Do I still prefer using the Pixel over the S8? Sure. But I wouldn't buy a 128GB Pixel XL over a Galaxy S8+ today. That would be, frankly, a bit silly. If Google was asking $670 and not $870, the discussion would probably change, but they aren't. You've got to pay full price, and there's no way I could recommend anyone do that. If you're still on the fence about the Pixel, let me try to push you over: wait for the next generation. I realize that this sort of thinking can devolve into a rationale that encourages you to never upgrade anything because something newer, faster, and better is constantly on the horizon. But in this case, I think it's a consideration that is worth weighing more seriously than usual. Many of the Pixel's biggest flaws relate to Google's inexperience producing a smartphone. Issues that only come up as you try to mass-produce and distribute a product with a real marketing campaign that creates real demand, and the phone gets into the hands of "real" users who aren't part of the now-derailed Nexus phone hypetrain. Inside Google, expectations were no doubt managed, realities realized, and priorities accordingly re-calibrated after this first launch. (Side note: if the Bluetooth performance on the next Pixel is as bad as the first one, I may scream, Google.) Meanwhile, the things that make the Pixel great aren't going anywhere. The next Pixel will be fast, it will take great photos, and it will offer a wonderfully unfettered Android experience. Those that make it less than great? Google is no doubt drilling down through the worst of them in order to ensure the Pixel 2 - or whatever it's called - won't make the same mistakes that the original did (waterproofing, please). And one of the primary reasons to try the Pixel in the first place - to be on the very bleeding edge - really only remains true from a software standpoint. Older phones like the Nexus 5X and 6P don't even let the Pixel have an advantage there, as they're on the same update track until around the time the next Pixel phones launch. If you absolutely need a smartphone soon and the Pixel is tempting you, ask yourself this: Can you deal with a Moto G5 Plus for six months if it means having a better Pixel down the road? While as a reviewer I have the admitted luxury of not needing to consider such things, were I in such a position, I'd have little in the way of a counterargument to offer. Sure, you'll take a resale hit on anything you buy now, but the Pixel is going to face a much, much steeper devaluation curve in that time than any budget phone. Buying a Pixel right now just doesn't make sense. I love my Pixel XL, but I'm officially done recommending the phone to friends and relatives. Instead, I'll tell them to wait, or to get the Galaxy S8 they were probably going to buy anyway. Tags editorial google pixel google pixel xl opinion pixel xl subscribe ...

Google really shot themselves in the foot with availability. My name is…. No, they shot their foot with huge bezels, with lack of waterproof, lack of dual speakers, no real camera progress compared to nexii, meh battery life, meh screen. No real selling point besides being pure android phone. This phone had iphone price but was worst on so many levels (no A10 SoC, no iphone-fast NAND, no 4yrs updates) Oneplus on the other hand........ M. Luciano Also has none of that stuff, but is cheaper? My name is…. yes, half price cheaper. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ The black screen issue kind of negates anything else ;) Michael Hannigan What's the "black screen issue"? Carson Saldanha YOU WANT THE PIXEL TO HAVE THE A10 CHIP?? BHAAAAAAAHAHAHA My name is…. No, i want it to have a cheaper price, or be better somehwere else, like the Galaxy. STOP BEING RUDE Carson Saldanha https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CYF7C6hVAAAKF-_.jpg Tr3ple Shut up troll ,nobody likes you I see lmao My name is…. You know when you see the dumb guy, he always adds 'lol' or 'lmao' at the end of his sentence. And his syntax is always wrong. STFU and GTFO Liam Bulkley "You know when you see the dumb guy... And his syntax is always wrong." "You are an [sic] ignorant" Don't cut yourself on the glass. Michael Hannigan They have that - The Nexus 5x. Тарас Мукин You keep hating Pixel in the comments, but you only look at numbers. But they doesn't matter when it comes to Google. Software experience does. My name is…. That's a stupid argument Тарас Мукин And saying that somebody's argument is stupid without any explanation is a much smarter argument. My name is…. Would you pay 900$ bucks for Nexus 5 just because "Software experience matters"?? Carson Saldanha Nobody said they were paying just for the "software experience" Matt Tapac said that specs don't matter, the software experience does. That heavily implies that people are paying for the software experience. Carson Saldanha xD here we go again drunken_bastard Pixel and Pixel XL have better cameras and screens than any iPhone. The difference in SoC and other bits of hardware, they don't translate into any real world speed differences. Pixel also has great battery life. Perhaps some hands on time may do you some good. supersanborn Given that they continually sell out of the limited stock they have, none of what you cited matters. If they had a ginormous supply of units and THEN couldn't sell, then perhaps you would be on to something. My name is…. What was the availability in the first place? You think they produced many? No way Jose, i bet Galaxies and iphones outsold pixels by multiple times supersanborn We don't exactly know what they had hoped to produce or even what they actually produced, so your point remains conjecture. And who here is suggesting that Samsung and Apple phones didn't outsell the Pixel? My name is…. * by multiple times James Betti Sadly, Google isn't keeping the Pixel in stock because they don't care about their hardware line. Google makes most of its money through ads and personal data. It's a shame, but it explains why they discontinue successful products and barely have much in stock. Excellent phone by the way. Michael Hannigan Well, that's easy to rectify. Do like Amazon and offer the same exact hardware with "special offers" for a lower price. Then you get to see ads everywhere, even your home screen and app drawer. Pretty cool. Michael Hannigan Yes, they did. It was in the millions. Max "no real camera progress compared to nexii, meh battery life, meh screen." Ok, so you don't have a Pixel, we get it. My name is…. I'm not dumb, do you get that too? Xchris I think the consensus here is that you are talking bollocks. The pixel XL has an unbelievably good screen, one of the best battery life figures, still has the best camera out of any smartphone. Nobody who bought the pixel cares that much about any of your other points. In fact, what you are really saying is that you didn't like the pixel. Big deal! My name is…. Actually, i'm fighting the pixel in a nerdy community. Its expected that the consensus is that "i am talking bollocks". People here mainly wanna root their phones and put center clocks on status bar. they did the same with Nexii devices, its all about the software, but those phones were seriosly lacking (i used to own all Nexus devices after 4) Carson Saldanha So may I ask, what phone do you use now? My name is…. 1+3 Carson Saldanha Srsly!?!? Bruh, the OnePlus 3 has a Snapdragon 820 while the Pixel has a 821, a far better camera, better performance, and software. How is the OP3 better than the Pixel? Besides the price? I could probably understand if you had the OP3T, but no way. My name is…. You are an ignorant. 1) Check the speedtests, 1+3 is faster (because better nand) 2) Software is better on 1+3 (aosp with tiny mods) 3) Pixel has underclocked 821, thus 820 with a little bit of better battery life (1+3 has 1080p screen to tie this up) 4) 1+3 has 6gb ram (will be good for 4 years) 5) 1+3 is smaller than pixels, unbelievably thin 6) 1+3 has dash charging (world leading) 7) 1+3 has half the price 8) 1+3T is another story, far better Apply cream to the burn, son PS Yes Pixel has a better camera. Carson Saldanha Ignorance at it's finest. My name is…. Those are all FACTS, son. My name is…. Where are you, son? Jack Smith Have you ever even used a Pixel? Only Android phone i have used with zero touch lag. Can we also stop the name calling? Mason Andrew Maseda Hate to break it to you man. I own The One Plus 3T the Google Pixel the Nexus 6P and the Moto X pure edition. Lol. Guess witch one is my daily driver? The Pixel. Why? Better battery . Better cam. All around the most reliable phone. Even with my Nexus 6P I've had some issues here and there tiny ones. Like some days my battery life was abnormally shit and the next day it was great. The one plus 3T has tiny issues too. The Pixel is a phone that you wouldn't understand UNLESS YOU TRY ONE FOR A DAY. come back when you do. tansuperman Not sure why people think the pixel takes good pics. I have a pixel xl, 950xl, IPhone 7plus, and now the s8. In my opinion the pixel xl takes the worst pics. The lumia 950xl is stop dog. The pixel I can tell is just too overprocessed Michael Hannigan I think it applies mostly to low light pictures - absolutely nothing touches the Pixel in that respect - trust me. More generally, it applies to the software and hardware working together to create stunning (real) HDR pictures. But in low.light, which according to a friend of mine who is a smartphone camera freak (I am not), quality of low light pictures are what users are primarily interested in because he says "...any recent smartphone can take great pictures in daylight.". For me, I liked the flexibility of the V20 camera - not just the dual lenses, but the absolutely fantastic functions in the camera app. D13H4RD2L1V3 Um, the 821 consumes less power than the 820 at the lower clocks due to a more efficient binning process. Also, both the Pixel and OP3 use UFS 2 controllers. But on Nougat, the 3 uses F2FS for its filesystem. It's not a case of better NAND. It's a case of different filesystems. Michael Hannigan I think they should use FAT16. I miss it. Chris Rey I will say the Axon 7 is just as good as the OnePlus 3 and looks better. Suicide_Note The Pixel camera is definitely superior to what was in the 6P, and i say that as someone who currently owns them both. M. Luciano I use both on a daily basis. Agree with you 100%. So do objective measurements of the cameras. Pixel is the best on the market; 6P is decent but not great. andy_o On paper both cameras should be just short of identical, but the Pixel is so much faster in processing cause of the HVX dedicated core, plus the N6P throttles like crazy (in one of my photospheres tests in a warm room the Nexus 6 beat it every time). This is crucial especially with Google who is prioritizing computational photography probably on par or more with hardware camera specs. Also, I'm not sure if this is a hardware or artificial limitation, but HDR+ auto has completely different behavior on the Pixels. I can understand how someone who has only looked at the specs and not used a Pixel and N6P (especially in the summertime), can think that there's been "no real camera progress", but this guy is balls-deep in the "arrogance of ignorance". Michael Hannigan I think the reason for the difference in HDR+ in the Pixel is that it's" real HDR - it takes several pictures and then layers them. Other phones have taken a shortcut do doing that with one picture and it really doesn't achieve the same. Except in one case - manually setting HDR in my Note 7 gave absolutely stunning night time photos. Something I can't quite achieve with the built in software on the Pixel (but can with Photoshop). andy_o I was talking the difference between HDR+ auto in the Pixel and HDR+ auto in the previous phones. The auto behavior in the Pixel is different, but the HDR+ processing is basically the same. There's more info here: http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/11/21/deep-dive-closer-look-google-pixels-camera/#What_does_HDR_do If you feel nerdy enough I can link you to a paper on HDR+ by the Google computational photography team too :) Regarding the other phone cameras, the reason they do worse isn't exactly that they they're taking shortcuts, it's actually because they're doing it the traditional way, taking different exposures. Read the AP article linked above for details on how HDR+ is fundamentally different. Michael Hannigan You have OLED burn-in? I have about 8 hours SOT/day and don't have any. That would piss me off. Jason B Inverting colors for a bit while doing some extended reading helps. Black background with white text is easier on the eyes too. But yeah, static nav bar and notification area aren't great for OLED. There should be auto pixel shift to prevent it ... or Google should make more use of Immersive Mode. whispy_snippet Ugh. Like a broken fucking record here sometimes. Shawn Spring While some of your other points may/may not be valid, to say that the Pixel had "no real camera progress compared to nexii" just makes you sound ignorant. The S821 ISP alone would make the camera in the Pixel superior, not to mention the updated HDR algorithms. Get a Pixel owner and a 6P owner in the same room (I was both) and ask them to shoot with each others phone and see who prefers which. The 6P camera lag in HDR mode was inefficient at best and unbearable at worst. And it wasn't that long ago that OnePlus was using a broken invite system, had people lick their phones, and had a horribly gender insensitive marketing campaign. I'd probably not hold them up as the standard bearer against Google. Michael Hannigan They had people lick their phones? Why did they never ask me to do that? That's discrimination. I should have been asked to lick my phone. Brett Lewis I love my pixel after coming from a HTC 8x on Windows platform. Never liked Apple and never will. And lately after all the talk of Samsung's products (blowing up, red screens, other problems) I'm quite happy with my pixel. I don't need water proofing I'm not an idiot that takes my phone near water.. the I hardly notice the bezels after coming from a 4.3 inch 720 display.. The htc8x had one of the widest angle front cameras but I dont take selfies. This pixel does what I want and is fast doing it. And for first time experiencing Android I'm quite happy with buying this with the newest and best version available. TheHater So only idiots take their phones near water? I bet if you had a water resistant phone, you'd take it near water. Michael Hannigan What about the toilet? Who doesn't read the news when sitting on the shitter? Mariano Moreira I would definitely agree in terms of the Pixel XL vs iPhone 7 plus comparisons (Non-32GB model) Comparing the base iPhone 7 vs base Pixel...the iPhone 7 base had(has) slow Nand performance from what I have witnessed. The 32GB iPhone 7 vs base 32GB Pixel (5") seems like a closer comparison where the compromise is better battery life on the Pixel, faster Nand, and better screen. Again, I concur that looking at the Pixel XL vs iPhone 7 Plus leans more heavily towards Apple especially when comparing the 128GB models. Michael Hannigan If you buy from the Google store, they are carrier agnostic - absolutely 0 carrier bloatware. Mariano Moreira No. I have a Google Play(Bootloader unlocked) purchased Pixel. Normally used on Sprint or At&t. When I activate on Verizon: to get Vo-LTE calling with Verizon SIM and certain carrier settings it does a software update switching the phone over to the Verizon specific software build. If it was truly Carrier-agnostic it wouldn't force a Carrier specific Software build onto my non-Verizon model Pixel. Michael Hannigan You must have either bought it from Verizon or screwed something up. An unlocked phone doesn't suddenly become carrier specific like you describe Mike John Quincy Adams I don't one person who owns or says ’I sure wish I had a OnePlus.' Michael Hannigan I have - when I had the OnePlus One. Many people asked me about it. You can't deny that OnePlus phones offer an unbeatable value. They don't skimp on specs and sell for half the.price they should. asrat_24 I get you're trying to make fun of that guy but don't make ignorant statements while trying to do it. Oneplus makes good phones and people are interested enough nowadays to say that. Major Sceptic Agree on all points , a mid range device with a flagship price , perhaps Google will adjust the prices on the 2 ? for a company trying to expand it's phone sales it's going a funny way about it . Artem Russakovskii Well, usually at that point you start seeing significant discounts, but the Pixel is a misnomer in that regard to due to low stock and high demand. Max Exactly, I would revise that affirmation to state: "I've always felt once we are less than 6 months from the new iteration, it's a mistake to buy the existing product *at full price*." supersanborn I'll grant there's a case to be made for some phones where waiting can result in substantial discounts (especially from HTC/LG/etc). Probably a little of my bias sneaks in here. I prefer to have the newer device, and if I waited 6 months post-launch, it probably means I myself need to wait until the next launch. Max I'm with you there, I usually buy a phone at launch or a couple of months later at most but remember that we aren't regular customers, that's why we read and comment on this site ;). For many people out there it makes more sense to buy a phone six months after release if it comes with a nice worthy discount. M. Luciano This ^^ supersanborn Agreed, for some, shaving $100-200 off the price is all that matters. I usually caution folk pretty hard in the last 3 months before the new iteration drops if they have any form of new feature/size/color envy. supersanborn And yeah, I'm nowhere near the "normal" consumer :-) needa Supposed to be picking up a 32gb XL (Google) for $450 near mint in a couple hours. I might not get it, but a killer deal nonetheless. M. Luciano Smash that deal :) Very nice. needa A few little scratches on the back glass. Profit.

The lowest I've seen on Swappa was $695 for a black XL. supersanborn True. I usually find that the discounts are kind of on the "meh" side though until we hit release of new product. I always basically tell folks that you either buy it at launch until about 6ish months post-launch, and if you've held off that long, you should just wait until next launch and either buy the old product at a big discount or buy the new one. Matt I believe your use of misnomer was a bit of a misnomer. Artem Russakovskii I did use the wrong word, you're right. el_smurfo That's why I just picked up a 6p last year for $400. Most expensive smartphone I've ever bought, but the full release price was just not in my budget. Karly Johnston Battery issues? MisterAlex Maybe an anomaly... but not a misnomer. paxmos Where is this high demand you guys talk about?, I have yet to see a pixel in anyone's hand M. Luciano Really? I know over a dozen people who have or had them. paxmos Yep...I see lots of iPhones and Sammy's, even one Blackberry Z30, have only seen a pixel in the Verizon store. M. Luciano I feel like a nerd owning 4 Major Sceptic It does seem to have more of an enthusiast following , no shortage of pixels in my region , the usual brands , apple, Samsung, still seem to have the sales , I know not one person that has a pixel or wants one , and I think Google only has itself to blame on that front, Re : the cost of a pixels . Goblin Shark Finally, someone who knows what they're taking about - my head is just shaking in disbelief reading what these marshmallow brains that think they know about phones are saying on this comment thread lol Daishi Exactly. I have yet to see a Pixel in the wild. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ To be fair, HTC isn't used to such a high demand for their phones. Google unfortunately paid the price Daishi This made me LOL! A post full of WIN for sure!! Zoglog Actually it's probably because of all the RMA's they've gotten JD Thought that was obvious. syxbit I wonder whether we shouldn't wait for Pixel + 2. The next Pixel may technically be the first Google made product (current Pixel is made by HTC), so it's possible the Pixel 2 will have first gen problems. Still, I still have the N6P (after I scoffed at the Pixel price and refused to buy it), so I going to be looking for a phone soon. Good_Ole_Pinocchio HTC is also manufacturing the Pixel 2. Word on the street. Daishi That's too bad. I'll avoid this this phone as well... Captain On! Well, technically the iPhone is made by Foxconn, so... Don't expect Google to actually build their own facilities to produce hardware. Carson Saldanha Pretty sure they'll still be using HTC. Might have more control over the design this time around though. 4Ui812 The availability issue is a play out Nintendo's handbook. Good_Ole_Pinocchio 100% agree with the entire article... Do I want the Pixel Software Experience and Camera? Yes... But not when the new version is a few months away thag would probably fix all the issues I see posted on this site ever so often...starting with the Bluetooth issues. I got an S8... Because it's the only phone thay makes sense to me right now..... I'll see what Google is doing in the fall Max Johnson If the Moto G5 Plus had NFC I would have no problem making it my Android daily driver for the next 6 months. wade_county Moto Z Play and OP3/OP3T are other options with NFC. shadowx360 I used to buy 1 generation old Nexus devices to get around the cost issue, but it seems the 5X and 6P both are plagued by serious phone-killing issues. Now that warranty is up on nearly every used 5X/6P, buying used is like trying to navigate a minefield. I don't really trust 1st generation Pixel to not have serious issues either. I'd never use a non-Pixel/Nexus device but I can't buy a Pixel XL knowing Samsung offers so much better hardware at a similar price. wade_county My advice is getting the next OnePlus phone or picking up a used OP3/OP3T. AndrewGM I bought a used Pixel in good shape on eBay, as I couldn't get one from Google Store (already had a wireless provider). Switched from an iPhone 6s, after using almost every iPhone model since and including the original. Much better camera on the Pixel, especially closeups and in low light, and much easier to use overall (especially Contacts vs. iOS), as I've used mostly Google apps for a long time. I like the Google keyboard much better and the Android interface. I'm definitely satisfied with the Pixel and have no real iPhone regrets. It's true there are more apps for the iPhone, but that doesn't matter because the core apps are available on Android too. The only app I miss is Enlight, for photo editing. The one Pixel issue I agree with is the relatively poor resale value vs. iPhones (I assume). Carson Saldanha May I suggest Snapseed for photo editing? (It's developed by Google) Also, do you miss iMessage/FaceTime or is that really a con? AndrewGM Will check out Snapseed, thanks. I've been using Google Photos to lightly edit pics. The Pixel camera is so good that I often don't edit (for Instagram/FB uploads), especially if the light and composition are already good. I don't miss iMessage at all. I had to turn it off and all that stuff for my phone number when I switched, but I'm texting away every day. Emoticons seem to work fine. I don't even think about iMessage. FaceTime has been replaced with Duo for my family members, including those on iPhone. Seems to work fine. And I can share location with family members via Google Maps. I guess that brings up privacy issues vs. using Apple products, but not sure it makes a real-world difference. Battery life, btw, seems pretty good (I charge the phone overnight only). The call quality is a little less than iPhone, maybe, but overall acceptable. AndrewGM Will add that I have had the Pixel for 2 months and use it daily. I like the screen on the Pixel (or at least it never bothers me), and the issue about the "chin" at the bottom being big is a non-issue to me. I don't notice it and in fact hold the phone sometimes there, which is arguably convenient. If the phone continues to hold up, I'll be a customer for Pixel 2 eventually. Eric I was ready to jump to the Pixel XL after returning my second Note 7, but Google never gave me the opportunity to give them my money. Carson Saldanha xD My name is…. It was never a good device. thank you for finally admitting that. Andrew I don't think that's what the author is saying... My name is…. Someone had to be crazy to buy a pixel in the first place. I was bashing on that device from day one. Author, months later, says that the phone is no good. It was never good. Carson Saldanha Lord, would you just chill? Tr3ple I think he's retarded, gotta be it, lol. Must be it actually. Carson Saldanha troll by far Suicide_Note Except that's not at all what the author said, so you're either: A) trolling, B) incredibly dumb, or C) both of the above. Тарас Мукин Of course there's no point in buying Pixel for full price now. And there's more: there's no point in buying any device for it's starting price when it's 3 months old — tech gets old really fast today. And that's the whole point of not buying something at day one — everything gets much cheaper very fast. Samsungs do, LGs too. But Pixel for some reason didn't. And Nexuses were like this too. So — only buying Google devices right after release makes sense. Or buying them unofficially and cheaper. Sad, but true. sraj49 I always like and respect your articles. You put your views straight forward. But I tend not to agree with the tone and content of this article completely. I am living in Home of full Apple products and I own a Pixel XL. I love the Pixel in all aspects. Yes there are room to improvements which is true for everyone. Apple products are well designed, well built. As regards sorry gone are those days when Apple sorry was at is best which was until iPhone 4s/ iPhone 5. Now after the warmth period it is the same as Pixel. I going Pixel after sales support very good. I definitely agree with you on the most inefficient handling of supplies and also this is not the time to buy since meet models are coming. Just to add, I get sick when people say that the Pixel phones are not made by Google but by HTC. Everyone outsources manufacturing. Most of the phone are made by Foxcon staying from Apple. All phone manufacturers only design the hardware, software and the manufacturing is outsourced. Good_Ole_Pinocchio The HTC point that keeps coming up comes from the fact that Google didn't really dsign much hardware hete. They just used HTC parts. It's not the same as hardware being designed by apple then manufactureres elsewhere. andy_o I think he's right on that point. Google support may or may not be good, but it's online only. Apple support is famously good. For instance, the recent fixes for iPhone 6s battery problems. I booked an appointment, went into the store, they told me it would be a bit, went to a coffee shop, they emailed me, picked it up. Another time my iPad mini 2 mute switch broke. Again, appointment, go in the store, got it actually just exchanged on the spot. Google simply cannot do that. JohnyNoLegs What android phones have you owned prior to the pixel? And yes it's a HTC phone through and through. Scofabear Shots fired! I even dumped my 6P for a Moto z play. No regrets Futbolrunner Same here! That 808 was a lag fest. I even got the S8+ but returning it because it can't touch the Play's battery life. Dominic D I just bought a Pixel a month ago. I still would recommend it if you get one for fairly cheaply on swappa. It's awesome. Brian Demodulated My last 3 phones have been Nexus. Each has been less reliable than the last. I love how hackable they are but I think my next phone will be a Samsung Galaxy. Carson Saldanha Elaborate? Wdym by "less reliable" What issues? Brian Demodulated My Samsung Galaxy Nexus was incredible and still works today. My Nexus 5 was garbage - two broke within 1.5 years. My 6P is quirky - it doesn't charge on my home PC and although my wife's updated to 7.1.2 mine says it's up to date at 7.1.1. Tr3ple Get a pixel then, Samsung lol. Brian Demodulated I have my 6P another year. I'll see what's available next year when my contract is up. JohnyNoLegs Bootloops, dodgy updates, requires factory resets, breaks features, slow bug fixes. M. Luciano No offense, but you are not going to increase stability by going to Samsung. Brian Demodulated My old Samsung Galaxy Nexus was the best, highest quality, most reliable phone I ever owned. LG and Huawei's Nexus phones were less stable for me. M. Luciano I had a few of those.. they weren't as reliable. But probably because I did bad things to them. Brian Demodulated I rooted mine, loaded hacky ROMs, and carried it with me everywhere I went for 3 years. The USB and audio cables are a little loose now but otherwise it's saved me when my later Nexus phones crapped out on me. Vitali Galaxy nexus had clean stock rom, it is just Google's clean soft in a Samsung physical device and not with samsung's os Brian Demodulated Every Nexus has the clean stock ROM. It's one of the top reasons why I get them. JohnyNoLegs Going Pixel sure doesn't increase stability. It's less stable than my Note 4/Note 7. Vitali Agree with M. Luciano, but people try should move to Sony. Lookup at speed test videos of their Xperia XZs, it has beaten all smartphones by now, including the Pixel. All the biased big reviewers out there will never tell you the truth, stop thinking the S8 is the best phone in the world.. I recommend you to wait for their Xperia XZ Premium it will have sd835! After you see the XZs speed, I promise you it may be the fastest phone even in 2018. Suicide_Note No. Just...no. Vitali *A wild 8 year old fanboy comment appears* Brian Demodulated Speed isn't that important to me. I've heard bad things about Sony's flavour of Android and that it's bloaty. Vitali So you heard wrong, their software is one of the bests out there, and im talking from experience.. And Samsung have so clean and fast Android that it is just unbelievable.. Where do you get all that info from?? Vitali So you heard wrong, their software is one of the bests out there, and im talking from experience.. And Samsung have so clean and fast Android that it is just unbelievable.. "I've heard.." Where do you get all that info from?? Suicide_Note TW is much better than it used to be, but it's hardly clean and fast. Brian Demodulated I work in a large IT department. One of my buddies told me about it. He said Sony's Android UI was all over the place and annoying to use, and that his handset was 2 major versions behind the latest version of Android OS. dtox Lol don't listen to him, xperia phones are absolute trash. dtox LOL xperia = garbage D13H4RD2L1V3 Um, I'm not entirely sure. Not that I'm ragging Sony, but they haven't exactly been selling for a reason. Even Sony themselves know. I don't hate Sony phones. I personally think they're understated, solid offerings. Problem was that they were really overpriced. After seeing the XZs and XA1, seems like their pricing may have become more logical. We'll see how it goes. I'm personally hoping the XZP may even be a solid device. Not that I'll buy one but if the price is right, it'll be significantly easier to recommend. JSo Experiences differ from person to person. But It's odd the luck you have had with the Nexus devices. I've had the Galaxy Nexus, Nexus 5 and now the Nexus 5X and I have never had an issue with any of them. JohnyNoLegs No battery issues with 5X? My wifes upgraded to 7.1.1 and has never been the same, bluetooth is slow and laggy, and the battery barely gets 1.5-2 hours SOT after it used to get close to 3. Michael Hannigan Dude, you're talking about a crusty old obsolete phone. And unless you are happy getting 2 hours of battery time, you should pry the wallet open and buy something current. Complaining about your old phone won't make you feel better. Replacing it with a working, current phone that's not past it's expected useful life will. JohnyNoLegs Dude, wth are you talking about. It's a 1.5 years old. From new it was getting 4-5, right up until 7.1.1 update. Roy My 6P is the most reliable phone ever. And I had Samsung and HTC. Duder12 The last Nexus phones had bum processors from qc. royrov My Nexus 6P kissed the asphalt a couple of weeks ago, so I bought a perfect Pixel XL second hand (used 3-4 months). Its better, no regrets here. Faster and better battery, hell even snapchat is snappy on it! Tr3ple Exaclty lol, people saying the pixel isn't an upgrade to the 6p are delusional lol. They all like to hate on it u til they get one and realize how good of a phone it is. And all the bugs I've been seeing on the net are nowhere to be found and I had mine for 5-6 months now bekifft I know it's an upgrade. It's just not much of an upgrade for an enormous amount of money. Tr3ple My 6p had serious issues, I went and got a s7 egde(big mistake), the price I paid was well worth it. I'm still financing my s7 egde while I'm using a pixel, this is how much I love this phone. destinyhud I will still buy one Michael Tran If I could give you a phone for free but you had to keep it and use it and couldn't sell it. Which phone would it be? M. Luciano 128 GB Pixel XL, black supersanborn My 128GB Pixel XL in black. At least until the 2 comes and **hopefully** adds waterproofing, 600Mhz support, 4x4MIMO for T-Mobile. If you're reading, Pixel team, let's talk! Orlando aka Pixel XL Samsung Galaxy S8+ blue Tr3ple Gimme a 128 gb pixel XL black any day keithzg The bezels really are due for a shrink. Boy are you gonna rue this when the second-gen comes out and the bezels are the exact same ;) M. Luciano I sorta hope they are :) keithzg You animal! (But honestly, this is why choice is good. I find the desire for those top and bottom bezels incomprehensible, but I can entirely understand that not everyone would feel the way I do, particularly if routinely holding phones very differently.) M. Luciano I just want SOME bezels. They don't need to be huge. Just want a place to put my thumbs when holding it sideways. It's a good place for speakers IMO. Carson Saldanha Nah, to be fair, I think Google's definitely not planning on keeping them the same size if they've listened to the reviews. keithzg I mean, if they'd listened to reviews of many other phones before they put out the Pixels they would have known that too---including, for instance, the previous two generations of Nexus phones . . . So it seems likely that either (a) they know of the opinions of the commentariat and disagree, or (b) they felt technically they couldn't do it. I'm personally hoping it was somehow just (b) but they used (a) to convince themselves that it was an okay sacrifice, but that they won't have to make the same sacrifice again this year and they'll allow themselves to change up the design. But I'm not gonna bet too much money on that. Carson Saldanha Whoa, you lost be there with all those "a's" and "b's" xD Shawn Spring I think its pretty well known at this point that the time frame between when Google's negotiations w/Huawei fell through and when they picked the deal up with HTC was the cause of the "let's use the leftover A9 shells" bezel issue. So more (b) than (a) assuredly. ikeofkc If they do. Peoples' thumb muscles are going to be screwed if they use the pixel 1 handed, constantly trying to reach the back button. The chin makes one handed use possible keithzg See, that's what I mean about different folks and different strokes. I've never noticed it being of any help with my Nexus 6P, for me the top and bottom bezels are completely useless. bekifft If they actually put something useful there, like a front facing stereo speaker, I would be totally fine with that. keithzg Dammit, don't you go making me miss the Nexus 6 again! Michael Hannigan I want them to be bigger. I want to be able to lean on mine when I am standing in line at a movie. MadMartigan I am constantly amazed by the short memories. The author thinks it likely they are likely to have a better launch of P2? They do give the obvious impression that they believe the Pixel to be their first swing and a miss... Funny how quickly we forget, well, nearly every other device Google has ever tried to sell. I personally loved my 4, 10, 5, 6, and 6. But I cannot, while keeping a straight face, argue that one should expect anything better from them regarding inventory management this time around. How many times does Google have to fail on inventory management before we start pointing and laughing at the people who constantly say, "They'll get it right this time, for sure." Don't get me wrong - I would absolutely love it if Google proved me wrong on the P2. I just won't believe it until I see it. //dons flameproof suit// A'ight, I'm ready. Fire away... M. Luciano This is their first swing and a miss, but only because the shortages are for very different reasons than prior devices they sold on behalf of other OEM's. MadMartigan Who...who do you think made the Pixels? M. Luciano Google is the OEM for the Pixel phones (and tablets, and laptops, etc). HTC is the factory putting the phones together. It's a totally different legal and business agreement, and essentially means that Google has to supply most of the components, contracts, contacts, etc. and HTC is essentially an assembly line. On Nexus phones, the OEM was Samsung, or LG or Huawei, etc. and they actually designed and produced the phones, in partnership with and input from Google. Completely different. For those, the partner was able to do all the contracting and sourcing; HTC isn't doing all the work for Google this time. MadMartigan So you don't believe HTC designed the Pixel. Got it. That's all I needed to see. M. Luciano Not sure what that means, but ok. Google is now the OEM, that's what I am saying. Another Scott Nice post. I hemmed and hawed about a Pixel XL 128 for 6 weeks last fall and finally decided I just couldn't do it. Besides the fact that it was impossible to get from Google, I just couldn't justify the price. I decided to finally replace my LG Nexus 4 (roughly $350 new) with a new T-Mobile LG V10 from B&H in November for $330 and am quite pleased. (It would have been $300 a week or so later.) I added a Samsung EVO 128 GB SDHC card for it for $40 or so. I miss the Nexus timely updates a great deal, but I can't see spending a kilobuck on a phone to get it - especially for only a 2 year OS upgrade availability. I hope Google gets the Pixel 2 right, but maybe they figure having a "premium" phone for evangelists is good enough so they won't feel any pressure to make it available (or cut the price). Cheers, Scott. fijisiv The Galaxy S8+ is $20 less than a 128GB Pixel XL Just wow. M. Luciano Right? The Pixel is by far a better value at those prices. 128 GB storage over 16, metal over glass body, better software, better security, better camera, guaranteed to be up to date for 3 years... Samsung has some great components, but as a package, Pixel seems to keep ahead at this point. Matt I believe the S8+ is 64G and has a microSD slot. M. Luciano I think you're right. IMO that makes the Pixel better. Do you prefer less with expandable option? 03grunt I live in the mountains of NC and went back to Verizon once they brought back unlimited data and luckily the local Verizon store had a Pixel XL. I think it's pretty sad that in ~ 18 months the Pixel will be EOL. M. Luciano Luckily, it won't be. Nexus and Pixel devices are guaranteed to be fully up to date for 3 years; not 2. 2 years of major updates and 3 years of security updates = 3 years of being fully up to date. Sir_Brizz That's not entirely true. They are only guaranteed to be on the latest version for 2 years. It's unlikely it will be any different than the Nexus 6 in this regard (which didn't get 7.1 but is still getting monthly security updates). M. Luciano The Pixel and Pixel XL released October 4, 2016. They're guaranteed to be fully up to date until 10/31/2019. That's 1121 days, or 3.07 years. Sir_Brizz No. You are wrong. They are only guaranteed version updates until October 2018. The Nexus 6 was guaranteed the same thing until October 2016. It did not get Android 7.1 even though it continues to get monthly security updates. What this means is that the Pixel will get at least Android 9.0 but that doesn't guarantee it will get 9.1 or 9.2 or anything else past that. It just means it will get 9.0 and monthly security updates to 9.0 for an additional year. M. Luciano I get what you're saying, but it also launches on the latest update. So using the Pixel, it launches with N, will get O after a year, will get P after a year and then is not guaranteed to get Q. Are we really going to get a Q? So during each of those three updates, N, O and P, it on the latest OS and getting monthly security updates. 2 years of updates, so long as it includes the 2nd major OS update, translates to three full years. Ever since they started the annual number and letter update, we're essentially talking about a single API version update per year (2016 had 2, including the one you're referencing which impacted Shamu). Sir_Brizz I've already pointed this out twice: look at the Nexus 6 for a first hand example of how this is going to work. The Nexus 6 will not be on the latest version of Android for three years because it is already not on the latest version of Android despite getting monthly security updates. 03grunt Thanks for clarifying! Chris Kiederer As a Nexus 5X/project Fi user, right now the Pixel is my only choice if my Nexus decides to blow up like many before it. I really hope this Android one rumor heading to the US is true, as it would give project Fi subscribers more than just a really expensive option to stay on the plan Andye82 But exactly one year from today it will be still extremely difficult if not impossible to get your hands on pixel 2 Mix "Persistent stock issues have plagued Google's first "in-house" handset from day one..." I am on my 3rd phone and I still wonder, every time I use it, if it will be like my last two phones. I have phone PTSD! Google should just pull a Nintendo and just stop producing and move on to the 2 but not fuck it up. John Doe Great job on the article, now I will be waiting for the editorial on Google's software update policy LoL PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Google's inexperience producing a smartphone They had great experience running Motorola. Ammar "Sure, Google got some things astoundingly right: the performance, the camera, the larger software experience" To be honest, these are the only reasons why I'd ever get a Pixel over any other Android phone. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ I agree with some of Radar's points as well as teh main one as I've *never* recommended the XL because I know that the vast majority of people are sheep-like followers and/or technophobes, and I defifnitely don't want part of the onus for a technophobe's major purchase that they're going to rue the second that an iPhoner mocks them. The Pixel sells itself to PowerUsers on its own merit, which, AEB the popularity of inferior and/or questionable top-sellers, clearly supports my previous assertions. JPLoureiro Deciphering of your sentences will commence............. now. Futbolrunner What? Marty I never was going to buy an HTC Pixel. Don't like HTC and the build quality doesn't deserve such a high price. jawsnnn My SOs Pixel is probably the buggiest Google phone I have used till date. The Google Assistant, voice search are consistently broken and the phone doesn't offer much else in way of justifying it's price. Will definitely buy an OEM phone next. Google's hardware experiment is dead for me. Tim Harman I wish I'd read this 2 weeks ago! Oh well. I've got a Pixel now and I do love it. I live in NZ and the version I ended up with is the American one, which means that while it supports all my LTE bands, it doesn't support Carrier Aggregation on the bands used here. So that's my excuse for why I simply MUST HAVE the P2 when it's released. Damian Stuart Wow, what a load of crap! The Pixel is a superb phone with issues affecting small numbers of devices. I have one, after moving away from the Samsung range. I have had no issues and as I don't ever intend to take a phone swimming haven't got a single complaint about it. But haters gonna hate. sebastianer @David Ruddock Don't forget the terrible compass. If you grab an iPhone 5S and a Pixel. Open Google Maps in both of them. An you start walking trough dense downtowns the whole day (closing / opening maps at different places). You will see that the Pixel compass accuracy is constantly changing every time you open maps and is a total mess while the 5S is perfectly accurate after 1-2 seconds and less than one step. I hope the next Pixel has a completely new sensor...or compass or whatever. Last 3-4 Google Phones were a mess. I think the last Google phone with more or less good compass was the galaxy nexus but I can't even remember now TechGuy22 i'm selling mine soon since i know i can sell it around 600 dollars and it's the 128GB wjrandon So glad I kept my Nexus 6P for a second year... and look at those rock solid resale values. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9d5926ba5094521287d1d54e2476d3852462178bdf74a16166f94742b435213c.jpg TechGuy22 i sold mine for 500 dollars and i bought it used too lol that's how i managed to get the XL 128GB eric messenger It depends on what phone your coming from. For most android users it is a great phone with a great camera. If your coming from an iPhone the pixel is the first great alternative to an iphone. The on device support is actually awesome and they are very quick with support issues. I am used to Nexus devices plagued with serious issues that you had to work around and while they were great phones for the price I felt they all suffered (maybe not the 6P). Anyway the point is pixel raised the bar for Android and brought it up to par with Apple. It's probably still worth buying if you have to upgrade, and you can just get the pixel 3 in 2019 or 2020. Sean You can say this about any phone at the moment....wait for next gen. As a Project Fi user I am waiting on a phone that has the cell radio to take advantage of T-mobile's new 600mhz band they are quickly rolling out...and NO, it cant be done with a software update on any phone. me me "quickly rolling out"? The spectrum is sold but not available yet as the current user vacates.... Sean NOT TRUE....they are rolling it out in areas NOW where the old TV stations have already vacated the band. Google is your friend. me me finally, you realize it was crap, was always, still now, only thing now is you changed. Never worth the money, specs so-so for the price. Islam Google Pixel poor use of space. over-priced. BS Sean People that actually OWN one dont agree........ TechGuy22 i agree and i have one. sadly, it just stopped caring about the bezel since there's nothing i can do to make it look better VAVAMk_2 6P user here with a new battery happily waiting it out for Pixel 2. Sean Boot loop much? Ernie I have had my Nexus 6p since day one of the release. I have been lucky not to have encountered the boot loop or battery problems others have reported. I love my Nexus 6p. Hope it will get Android O. Phone_Addiction Pixel 2 probably going be the same story. Google will never learn. Dean F Marsh I love my Pixel XL! Invest in a good quality case and enjoy the phone. It's really pretty decent and for a few minor quirks mentioned, and none that I have experience yet, I can't be happier. From Nexus, HTC, Samsung, to Pixel XL, this has been the best so far. Ailín Ó’S I live in Ireland and Pixel isn't even available here yet which is odd given we were a launch country for Nexus 5x/6p but hey ho. Rick Schoonmaker This is just what I like to read after getting banged by Google and Huawei with the 6P bootloop issue 1 year and 2 days (read 2 days out of warranty) after buying and being told that my only option is to buy a new phone. So after being without a phone for a week, I had to buy a Pixel XL even though I really didn't want it and especially at the ridiculous price ($860 for 32Gb.. are you effing kidding?). Matt Definitely. I got a pixel XL the very first morning when it was available in local store. Great phone, camera, software. 2 months later, the phone began to behave crazily--extra hot, microphone malfunction. Called Google support for like 10 times and had it replaced, then I put the brand new replacement on local trade platform without hesitation. Google-brand is attatractive, but does not worth that rediculous amount of money. I can get a even better performed oneplus counterpart for almost half price. Anyway, I am on my moto x 2014 with lineage os 14 and i am pretty happy. It is sufficient for me to deal with my daily work. And I also suggest to wait for the release of more flagships from variant companies to have more flexible and reasonable options. Spinkick Google seems to not be able to follow through on anything these days. It just seems like if its not sexy or cool and needs actual work, they cant be bothered. Maybe they will release another chat app in the meantime.. 2 Men-E I want the Pixel 2 XXL (Taimen). It better exist as a 5.6"+ screened device. Philip Although if you're with TMobile. It's significantly cheaper to buy the Pixel, and get your money's worth. Granted the Pixel is guaranteed two years of support, it matches with TMobile promotion pay credit time. h4rr4r They offer a discount? I thought it was just financing. Philip Yep. $325 in TMobile bill credits over two years. Which is when the Pixel 3 will be out. So you buy a Pixel, get refunded about half of the cost. And then you're ready to upgrade to the third generation. belac77 shhh, David, I just listed my Pixel for sale on Swappa! ;) Mason Andrew Maseda This entire article is just terrible and written by someone just mad they don't have one. M. Luciano lol he got one the week after I did. He's had one. Adrianus Bratanata Supply and demand. As long as there is bigger demand than supply they don't need to reduce the price drunken_bastard I disagree. All the pros you mentioned for the Pixel -- pure Android experience, performence, camera, etc -- those are all the reasons why the Pixel and Pixel XL is still the best smartphone on the market. Worried a new one is going to come out? Happens with every flagship, every year. This one doesn't have the lastest SoC? I challenge you to demonstrate real world differences in actual speed versus the Galaxy S8, which is a gorgeous handset that yet again is crippled by bloated software and long standing issues that never seem to get addressed. You cite support potentially ending in October 2018 for software updates, but that's still a longer window than any other Android flagship, and you get them day one, which Samsung and LG don't. A smartphone is more than the sum of it's parts. It's an experience. I feel on that quality alone, the Pixel and Pixel XL are the best representations to date. NeMoDoSeZ I was going to buy a 128gb Pixel XL but due to not being available I ended up waiting and purchasing a Galaxy S8+. I'm now glad things ended up the way they did because I'm loving my S8+. Rod Until Android 8 is released. Then you'll like: fuck Samsung man! My U$xxx phone is outdated, goddamnit! Owen Iverson I hate the world of tech. We've now gotten used to NEEDING the latest thing IMMEDIATELY. Its why companies like Microsoft, Adobe, and Autodesk have switched to monthly/yearly subscriptions so you have to pay for the rest of your life. "The Bluetooth performance is horrid." What metric, speed? Connectivity? "It's not waterproof." Not sure that waterproof is a common trait among all high-end phones just yet. "The bezels really are due for a shrink." I've never used a bezel-less phone, where do you pick it up or hold it? Does your finger trigger anything on the edges? "The Snapdragon 821 is officially old news." What are you running where 1) you see lag and 2) that it's an actual problem. Maybe people are replacing consoles with their phones just like they're replacing their DSLRs with their phones? "it doesn't support proper advanced network features across all four of the big US carriers." What are these advanced network features? Anyway, I know it's a phone blog, so ... D13H4RD2L1V3 Well, he means that since its successor isn't far off, and that the Pixel is still not easy to get hold of, you might be better off waiting, since the Pixel is also selling at full price still. Edward jh How can the camera be great I mean what about the pixel camera lens flare issue plaguing 1000's of users. Margaritas Ante Porcos Pixel was a disaster. The worst phone for that price. I understand some of you got the Stockholm syndrome. But some of us see the clear picture. Google simply lost this round with both hands down. Dan Yurman My Google Pixel seems to have a mind of its owns. Here's what it does without my asking it - 1. shuts down randomly and has to be restarted by holding the power button and lower end of the volume rocker for about 15 seconds; 2. randomly starts different pieces of software including a suspiciously high frequency of instances of Google Play Music, which I have since disable, 3. Starts the flashlight from the pull down menu if the phone is placed face down on a shiny flat surface, 4 And randomly starts other programs after unlocking the phone with a pin. On the plus side the camera does good work and the phone is easily held in one hand and scrolled with fingers from the same hand while eating hit wings with the other. :-) Ray I'm very glad I read this article. I was on the fence - and almost pulled the trigger the other day but very glad I didn't now. I'll wait for the next gen and hopefully it's a much better piece of kit - and possibly cheaper. lomsha Whaaaat, you don't say. rockon999 My 2015 Moto X PE's display stopped functioning properly and I needed a new device to *function* in my daily life. So I bought a pixel, yesterday. To address your complaints... I never use Bluetooth on a phone, I'm getting a case, I'll hate the speakers (but I really only use headphones), I'm no bezel snob, and finally... waterproofing? My Moto X PE was waterproofed and I can honestly say it never aided me in one single way. Sure, it felt great using the phone in the rain that one time. But I'm fairly certain an encased pixel can survive that. I know it is probably a horrible value, but I really don't want to deal with buying a $200 phone now, selling it later for $100, and then buying a new $900 phone in a few months. I don't have time to constantly be reselling and selling my devices and I don't have a spare $100 to just throw around on a device. Slurms Mckenzie Seriously have been saying most of what this article is about since day one. I have a pixel XL and I've hated it since receiving it. It's not worth what Google asks when everything that is offered can be had for half the money (quick updates not included) for that asking price it should at least offer sd card support which is something even the most basic phones have. I've been using Nexus phones since the beginning (skipped the 6) and the problems with them were expected as it was a budget friendly phone but if you want to charge premium pricing don't use cloth for your ear piece cover, have dual speakers, and for God's sake don't make deals with the devil (Verizon) to lock down MIMO as a carrier specific feature when every damn phone is capable of and and most carriers are as well F*** you Pixel XL you sack of shit what a waste of 800 bucks Rod Best camera Google photos unlimited backup at original resolution Best performance Lowest touch latency of all Android phones "Just" that. micahthomas Basically all you're saying is wait if a new version is going to be released in 6 months. Might as well just say that, doesn't really have anything to do with if it's iPhone or Android. JG I was about to order my mother a 32GB Pixel a week or so ago to replace her Nexus 5X. I recently discovered the glass of its camera lens has a pretty decent crack in it. It doesn't seem to affect pictures - yet... But we're planning a fairly photogenic trip this summer and I figured the Pixel has a better camera and has unlimited free full resolution Google Photos uploads so... But as I was about to click the "Add to Cart" button, I thought we're not all that far from the expected October release of the Pixel 2. I'm sure mom wouldn't mind being a generation behind, but... derk p just replace the housing on hers. i bought a white one but then wanted a blue back... was cheap on ebay and is very easy to snap on and snap off dizel123 Relatively speaking we're not too far from October of next year for the Pixel 3. Or October 2019 for the Pixel 4... toast I never buy Apple, and I never buy Samsung. But both of their hardware just feel slicker than the Pixel. As the article says, knock a few hundred off the price, and I'd be a keen buyer, mainly for the camera and fast OS updates, and Google "Purity". I'll wait and see how the upcoming Moto Z and X phones turn out. Defenestratus It'll be difficult for me to go back to a Google phone after the nightmare that was my 6P. Major Sceptic Availability is no problem in my neck of the woods , and I appreciate the work Google did on the camera as a point and shoot and smooth software , but after looking at the pixels they looked a bit underwhelming in the feature department , and then as mentioned the outrageous​ prices for the pixels I wouldn't go near one . I might add with the smooth software , Google no longer has the Monopoly on as most devices with 7.0 onwards are very good . Rod What feature does it miss? redsoxwin I'm not sure what this person's agenda is, but this is great phone. Strange article. Amie Perry Porter I personally love my Pixel phone. Will Dutton I never cease to be amazed that everyone always thinks that 'the next one will fix it' with android John Quincy Adams Whining about bezels is ignorance. Without bezels, how do you hold it? . ..please, bezel whiners...answer this... gar216 I'm a happy Nexus 6p user. Even prior to launch I couldn't justify upgrading my 7 month old 6p to a Pixel XL. It would have clearly been an upgrade, but I didn't think it was enough of an upgrade for the price. Also... It's kinda ugly. SiliconAddic "The Google Pixel is a notoriously hard phone to get a hold of. Persistent stock issues have plagued Google's first "in-house" handset from day one, and things really are little to no better in the six months since the launch event. " Um BS. Google has ALWAYS his issues with distribution. The Nexus 5 had this issue, the Nexus 6 had this problem, the 6p also had this problem and now the pixel. Google is incompetent when it comes to this. Meanwhile Apple can launch a new phone and you can walk into any of their stores and pick one up. I wanted a Pixel to replace my Nexus 6, could not get one. I ended up with a S7 edge. Google and Nintendo should team up with their inability to ship jack ****. Eric How does this stand to affect the resale value / trade-in value for current pixel owners under project fi? I'm asking as someone who switched to project fi from Verizon prepaid in early January, and has almost been regretting it ever since. I am a quadriplegic in a power wheelchair to whom the pixel with Google Assistant seemed a natural front runner, due to its voice capabilities, and project fi with it's much touted multi Network and Wi-Fi hopping capabilities seemed a good decision as well. Did my due dilligence and the 4G network to all appearances covered me completely, even though I live with my elderly parents in a rural area. The only option available for order at the time was a white Pixel (not XL) and 32gb. I was nervous about the 32 part at the time, but felt comfortable with the infinite backup capability of Google photos. Now, 3 1/2 months later, not only is service spotty, audio crackly despite not being a candidate for replacement under the microphone bug, and Google's customer service... Let us politely say not the most helpful on the issue. I apologize about the length of this comment, (and after reading over it I really should have made it a direct message) but the difference between a phone worth $600 and the phone worth $300 in retail/tradein is quite a big deal to someone like me, and as much as I love my pixel (and admire/fear/respect Google) getting out while the getting is good is starting to sound the smarter move. ( especially after the 180 they made on the 5x.... Grrrrr) Was curious to get an educated opinion on the subject. Thanks again for your ( and anyone else's who has read this far) time and any insight offered! dizel123 Opinion: Even if you can, you probably shouldn't read David Ruddock's articles anymore. Adam Myself having been using the Pixel since day one, I would agree to an extent... Would I go out a purchase a brand new Pixel/Pixel XL for full retail? Of course not! Only because the new iteration is just around the corner. Now, would I go buy a Galaxy S8 or an iPhone 7? No way, wouldn't even consider it! I have switched phones at least every 6 months for the past 3 to 4 years, between Android and iOS operating systems as well... Having said that, the Pixel has been the best phone and best experience that I have had to date! This is the first time that I haven't thought about what phone I want to get next, and to be honest there would have to be significant improvements for me to even get the newest iteration when it comes out this fall. This phone as just been that good. To sum things up... I would not buy the Pixel/Pixel XL right now at full retail cost, I definitely would NOT go out and buy a Galaxy S8 or an iPhone either... If you, like myself, really love the Pixel line and want to get one and don't already own one. I would suggest trying to hold out and get the newest release this fall. It's most definitely worth the wait! D13H4RD2L1V3 Google always seems to have issues with stocking ever since the Nexus days. Pretty embarrassing that it's still hard to get a hold of one after 6 months. Probably due for a small price cut soon, as newer phones roll out. me me yeah I loved Nexus back with Nexus 4, 5, 7. Now the Nexus banner is carried by the likes of Moto G, OnePlus.... H2OSKI So true. The bluetooth issues alone nearly make this phone unusable. Drops and cutout's every 20 seconds. Get this, my Pixel was fine UNTIL Google sent out "the server side" update to fix the Bluetooth issues my phone never had!!! Thanks Google. Mine is going back this week. Great camera crap bluetooth. I take pics occasionally​ but I need to use a bluetooth headset hours a day. Multiple headphones, headsets, and vehicle connections with all the same result...even in safe mode. Fail. Daishi Google shot themselves in the foot when they gussied up an HTC 10 and called it a Pixel. It is just any other Android phone and doesn't have the support behind it to justify the price. Six months along, it should be more than 50% off. William Ross Why the hell is this idiot comparing a 6 month old device to the newer releases? A year in smartphone years is a lifetime. That being said, the pixel still has the best most up to date software bar none! The camera is still among the best if not the best. And, although the 835 is a newer processor, the 821 is no slouch. GTFOH with this garbage article. And, I'll definitely be getting the next Pixel regardless of price. And, I'll sell my original on eBay for a pretty penny. And, this baby has no scratches any where. It's always been in a case and all glass has been protected by Liquid Armor. diggie Pixel is a $650+ phone built like a budget chinese phone. And sorry, Oneplus has Google beat on OS features while keeping "stock" feel. William Ross Oh here we go again with the one plus fans always hating on the pixel. If your phone is so great then why knock the pixel? I just don't get it. Just talk about how great your actual Chinese knockoff is. No need to hate in the Pixel. The one plus has little more than a cult following and mock my words, it'll never be a mainstream device. me me Android Police and a lot of its customers are hating the Pixel. The OnePlus fans just chime in. I own a OP3T. It simply works, yep even Bluetooth. When take tax into account, its about half the price. OnePlus fans biggest concern: price creep upwards. $300 becomes $350 becomes $390 becomes.... Goblin Shark Is this article from April 1st? Absolutely no one with any knowledge of phone tech recommended a Pixel, ever! Underspeced and overpriced, I doubt there's any trouble keeping them in stock they just know nobody wants them so they're not making any. Rod Under-spec'ed? Ok Underperforming? Nope Edgar Morales I honestly don't see what the problem is I purchased my pixel XL and have not to date had any issues whatsoever with it no Bluetooth issues no speaker issues nothing everyone is saying Michael Hannigan Hey, if you get a phone you love and it lasts just under a year, that's good enough. What more do you expect for a few hundred bucks. Appreciate the year you loved that thing and then replace it with a new one that you can love even more. Tom Takumi Okamoto OnePlus is a better phone maker than Google. A company not even 1% worth of Google. I really want a Pixel but it's not practical. Ionut Lala I'm sorry but that is clearly not a first generation device. Not the first from Google (made by HTC and let's not forget about the Nexus line). And not the first from HTC (for obvious reasons). Aquan Belk I wish other Android manufacturers went to stock Android. I know Samsung shines in it's own apps on top of Android but vanilla Android still is and always will be the best. Rod You heard the man, people. Don't buy a Pixel because it will have bad resale value and won't be updated for long. Instead, get a model that will have bad resale value and won't be updated for long, plus has worst performance, buggy software and worse camera performance. You're welcome. Stephonz My last Google phone was Nexus 5. As much as I like pure Android experience, Google has a bigheaded trend in phones. The price point was my biggest no no after the 5X. They don't offer as much features as the other well known Android companies.. amir80 I have a Pixel 32 gb and I really really like it. Everything works great and the camera is amazing and also the battey life. For me, the fingerprint sensor is a must. The S8 sensor is poorly located and the G6 sensor is too small. GeorgeDao123 Absolutely. The Pixel duo are 2 pieces of $#!¶. They run pure Android version and they are so slow to boot up and open apps though they are lag-free. Neru Nexus I've had a pixel since launch day. For one I don't agree with the bluetooth issues. Keep the phone up to date or use the bluetooth connect and play app to automate things. Second it is a over priced phone but so is an iPhone. The main reason real users should get a pixel is the updates. Sure you might need to learn something about that expensive piece of tech you bought and not just sit on your hands waiting for the apples or googles of the world to update your shit, but at least google gave us source code, kernel code and a unlocked bootloader. There are still updates being made for the old nexus 5, that's like 5 years old. Grab iphone 4s and tell me again about how fucking great those updates are lol. You can't even install apps like skype or whatsapp that thing is pooched. I can promise the world that even if google stops updating the pixel in 2018 there will be updated versions of the os you can manually install for years. Let's see if you can get more then one firmware update on your fancy new samsung s8. My money is on 1, then the s9 will launch a year later and samsung just won't care about the s8. rjcuk What if you want a slightly smaller phone? The S8 is 5.8" compared to the Pixel at 5". I really struggle to hold 6" phones. Even the Nexus 5X at 5.2" was too big to grip properly and comfortably. Janoo Ramachandran DON'T BUY A PIXEL. We have 2 Pixels at home. One bought early November 16 and the other end Jan 17. The one I was gifted this January, within 40 days had microphone related issues. I could not hear anyone on the phone, nor was the music being played out. They refused a replacement. My phone sat in the repair centre for 8 plus day and the mother board replaced. Have you ever heard of a new phone device of any other brand needing a mother board replacement in leads than 45 days WELL GOOGLE PHONE PIXEL NEEDED IT. The other phone bought early November 16 started having other issues last month and it wasn't recognizing the wifi. After at least 20 hours on the phone with the terrible google support, it had to be sent to the repair centre where it was kept for 2 weeks, you heard that right 16 days to be precise. Then the phone came back with a chip replaced. SHOULD YOI BUY A PIXEL EVER. :. NEVER SHOULD YOU LOOK AT GOOGLE AS A PHONE MAKER :. NEVER Nikhil I wholeheartedly concur here. I picked up a Pixel sometime around December which had to be promptly returned for a replacement as the volume rocker was rickety. The replacement didn't last long either. Within a month, the widely acknowledged microphone issues popped up and after almost 15 days of talking to the very incompetent Google support in India, their only resolution was to take the Pixel to the service center. The service center did not have the motherboard in stock (they had to bring it all the way from Taiwan) and my phone still languishes there even after 15 days of me submitting it. The phone suffers from not only just Gen-one product issues, but also terrible after sales support. Leonardo Baez Agree.... ait for the next generation THEN buy current generation cheaper. Jeremy Allan Actual customer service? You do realize that owners of a pixel get free 24/7 support any time, on a dedicated line for pixel owners? Exalm There is the same section in the settings on Nexus 5X and 6P. No idea whether it works, since there's no chat or phone support in Russia neither for Nexus nor Pixel. Cory Wilson I agree. Granted it was around a year ago I bought my 6p but the 6p didn't cost $870 either. Still don't regret that decision Impulse_Vigil Haven't really had any serious Pixel Bluetooth issues here... A handful of times (literally less than half a dozen) BT shut itself off back in Feb-March, hasn't happened again since the Play Services patch. I use Bluetooth on a daily 24/7 basis too with my ZenWatch 3, car audio, etc. I don't push it to its range limits tho. Dunno whether David's usage and issue is some sorta edge case, or range related, or whether he was speaking to the 1-2 month period when others were having more severe Bluetooth shut off issues. I do agree with the overall sentiment tho, Google hasn't made it easy to buy the Pixel and that's simply inexcusable. I haven't had to suffer thru any of the QC issues (no BT, mic, whatever issues here, knock on wood) but it seems they weren't handled super well either. To be honest I wouldn't even recommend the S8 to anyone either unless it's another geek/enthusiast, these days for most people it's simply not worth it to spend that kind dosh on a phone. I bought my mother a Moto Z Play; I'd probably point others towards that, the OP3, or an HTC One/S7 on sale. I'm super happy with my Pixel, but if there was a OnePlus 3-class device for Zoglog Having owned a pixel XL and now a s8+, I'd have to agree. Even not taking into account the questionable hardware reliability of the pixel (mine died in 5 months). Basically when I owned the pixel I loved the hell out of stock Android but I kept on wondering why I paid so much for it. Meanwhile with the S8+ the gorgeous screen makes it feel especially special and worth the price. Even though I would prefer stock Android 10000% sebastianer Pixel is just another Nexus. Like the 6P. There is no excuse, this is not their first premium phone. Still made by HTC instead of Huawei. And called Pixel instead of Nexus...and more expensive because of HTC and all the marketing costs. And..still has the shitty compass all their recent previous nexus had with a lot of topics open in Google product forums and staff giving tons of manuals about how to perfect calibrate something that doesn't retain calibration. But the main reason I wouldn't buy a Pixel...is the compass and secondly that you will get one more android update if you wait 6 months. username_not_valid How is the pixel the first 'in-house Google phone'? Its clearly and actually a slightly rehashed HTC. HTC doesn't just make it ,they designed it for all intents and purposes. Unless Googles design strategy happens to be exactly like HTCs then its not a Google phone. The Pixel is just an over priced nexus, nothing else. SOUL- Always great to see the smartphone community go from praising a phone to outright basing it just after a couple of months. Perfectly fine with my Pixel. Michael Sørensen It's just ... really boring. andy mckenzie It's a superb phone , blazing fast so processor is not an issue , amazing camera , free storage , online support has been fast and efficient in my experience, stock Android , I'd highly recommend to anyone. remister I am still using my 6P, I couldn't swallow the 1K price tag for 128GB with insurance.... Justin Field Yeah, I broke the screen on my 5x, and since I am on Fi I considered getting a pixel for about 2 seconds and ordered and new screen and fixed my phone. I will wait for the next gen or switch off of Fi.

This aspect ratio allows users to enjoy a full-screen view of their smartphone display, unobstructed by a physical home button. Samsung Galaxy S8 owners can access the controls for this area by going to Settings > Display > Full-screen apps. Here users will find a list of the device’s applications, both stock and downloaded. To enable full-screen mode on an application, users need only press the “On” toggle for any an application that doesn’t already have full-screen mode enabled. Read: How To Screenshot On Samsung Galaxy S8 Users will find many applications are set to fullscreen by default. On our Galaxy S8 handset, these apps include: Acorns, Android Pay, Android Wear, Chrome, Drive, Duolingo, Galaxy Apps Gmail, Google App, Google Play Movies & TV, Google Play Music, Google Play Store, Hangouts, iHeartRadio, Pinterest, Slack, Soundcloud, T-Mobile Name ID, T-Mobile TV, Voice, and VSCO. Users can disable full-screen mode on these apps if they so choose. Some apps, in particular, many simple stock apps, are optimized to remain in full-screen mode at all times. While they are included on the Full-screen apps list, users won’t be able to change the toggle from the off position. On our Galaxy S8 handset, these apps include Calculator, Calendar, Camera, Clock, Contacts, Email, Facebook, Gallery, Instagram, Layout, Lookout, Maps, Message, Messanger, My Files, Photos, Samsung Gear, Samsung Notes, Samsung+, Secure Folder, Settings, Smart Switch, T-Mobile, Twitter, Uber and YouTube. Finally, some apps support full screen but aren’t set by default. Users will be able to enable the full-screen feature for these apps through settings. On our Galaxy S8 handset, these apps include Alexa, Amazon Kindle, Amazon Music, Blogger, Boomerang, By CHOLE, Candy Crush Soda, Duo, Google Play Games, HelloMind, InstaRepost, NekoAtsume, Netflix, Super Mario Run, TouchTunes, Visual Voicemail, VLC and Word Cookies. Read: 8 Most Annoying Samsung Galaxy S8 Features Users will find applications without full screen enabled will have some extra black space at the top and bottom of the display, along the status and navigation keys areas. Apps with full screen enabled will display whatever is on the screen to the very edge of the display, especially at the top. Samsung Galaxy S8 full screen on versus off. Photo: Screencap: Fionna Agomuoh While the effect does not translate well within a screenshot, on a Galaxy S8 handset, users are able to see how apps can stretch to the very edge of the device’s thin, curved bezels. This is beneficial for apps such as Google Play Music. Full-screen mode allows users to have a complete vision of album art displayed within the application. Other applications that would especially benefit from full-screen mode include various video and gaming applications. The Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus have been on sale since April 21 and are available at a number of carriers and retailers.

Opinion: Even if you can, you probably shouldn't buy a Google Pixel anymore David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/05/01 2:09pm PDTMay 1, 2017 66 Plus 1 on G+ 263 Share on Facebook 60 Share on Twitter Total Shares389 Editorials Pixel Pixel XL The Google Pixel is a notoriously hard phone to get a hold of. Persistent stock issues have plagued Google's first "in-house" handset from day one, and things really are little to no better six months after the launch event. Honestly, it's a bit embarrassing just how consistently incompetent Google seems to be at keeping a reasonable inventory of phones available for purchase. But setting that aside, as one of the Pixel's most ardent evangelists, I think there's something it's probably time for me to come clean on: Even if you could buy a Pixel today, I really think you shouldn't. The Pixel is a product with generation-one product issues. The Bluetooth performance is horrid. It's not waterproof. The bezels really are due for a shrink. I don't think the exterior coating on the black and blue variants is of a particularly high quality. The glass window gets scuffed up incredibly easily. The Snapdragon 821 is officially old news. And it doesn't support proper advanced network features across all four of the big US carriers. There are other flaws I could point to, and while none of them are too terrible, they do speak to the slightly-rushed development cycle this phone seems to have been subjected to. Sure, Google got some things astoundingly right: the performance, the camera, the larger software experience. In fact, I think the Pixel is easily the best Android smartphone ever for these strengths, at least if we're talking about me personally as a user (your mileage, obviously, may vary). But for all the great, smooth, fast, clean, pure, simple, natural, and various other adjective-members singing in the Pixel-praise cavalcade, this phone is not the one to buy right now. For starters, Google continues to ask what is an increasingly laughable amount of money for the model most of us want - the 128GB XL - at a staggering $870. Sure, Apple charges the same for an iPhone 7 Plus 128GB, but I'm under no illusion that this comparison in any way favors Google. The iPhone comes with Apple customer service (with actual stores), a longer software support period going forward, and runs no real risk of poor resale value. The Pixel? Google's online support is iffy at best, we know the phone will be unsupported by October 2018, and I have a strong feeling generation-one Pixel resale values will drop like a rock once the new phones are announced. And that really is why, if you haven't pulled the trigger on a Pixel yet, you should just wait. It's overpriced, under-supported, and competing phones like the Galaxy S8 offer a whole lot more technology for your money. The Galaxy S8+ is $20 less than a 128GB Pixel XL, and I would argue it is far and away the better smartphone value. That amazing display, brand-new Snapdragon 835 processor, jaw-dropping design and packaging, and the full support of all our American carriers' latest LTE advancements could each be a reason on its own to put the Galaxy S8 above Google's smartphone. Do I still prefer using the Pixel over the S8? Sure. But I wouldn't buy a 128GB Pixel XL over a Galaxy S8+ today. That would be, frankly, a bit silly. If Google was asking $670 and not $870, the discussion would probably change, but they aren't. You've got to pay full price, and there's no way I could recommend anyone do that. If you're still on the fence about the Pixel, let me try to push you over: wait for the next generation. I realize that this sort of thinking can devolve into a rationale that encourages you to never upgrade anything because something newer, faster, and better is constantly on the horizon. But in this case, I think it's a consideration that is worth weighing more seriously than usual. Many of the Pixel's biggest flaws relate to Google's inexperience producing a smartphone. Issues that only come up as you try to mass-produce and distribute a product with a real marketing campaign that creates real demand, and the phone gets into the hands of "real" users who aren't part of the now-derailed Nexus phone hypetrain. Inside Google, expectations were no doubt managed, realities realized, and priorities accordingly re-calibrated after this first launch. (Side note: if the Bluetooth performance on the next Pixel is as bad as the first one, I may scream, Google.) Meanwhile, the things that make the Pixel great aren't going anywhere. The next Pixel will be fast, it will take great photos, and it will offer a wonderfully unfettered Android experience. Those that make it less than great? Google is no doubt drilling down through the worst of them in order to ensure the Pixel 2 - or whatever it's called - won't make the same mistakes that the original did (waterproofing, please). And one of the primary reasons to try the Pixel in the first place - to be on the very bleeding edge - really only remains true from a software standpoint. Older phones like the Nexus 5X and 6P don't even let the Pixel have an advantage there, as they're on the same update track until around the time the next Pixel phones launch. If you absolutely need a smartphone soon and the Pixel is tempting you, ask yourself this: Can you deal with a Moto G5 Plus for six months if it means having a better Pixel down the road? While as a reviewer I have the admitted luxury of not needing to consider such things, were I in such a position, I'd have little in the way of a counterargument to offer. Sure, you'll take a resale hit on anything you buy now, but the Pixel is going to face a much, much steeper devaluation curve in that time than any budget phone. Buying a Pixel right now just doesn't make sense. I love my Pixel XL, but I'm officially done recommending the phone to friends and relatives. Instead, I'll tell them to wait, or to get the Galaxy S8 they were probably going to buy anyway. Tags editorial google pixel google pixel xl opinion pixel xl subscribe ...

Google really shot themselves in the foot with availability. My name is…. No, they shot their foot with huge bezels, with lack of waterproof, lack of dual speakers, no real camera progress compared to nexii, meh battery life, meh screen. No real selling point besides being pure android phone. This phone had iphone price but was worst on so many levels (no A10 SoC, no iphone-fast NAND, no 4yrs updates) Oneplus on the other hand........ M. Luciano Also has none of that stuff, but is cheaper? My name is…. yes, half price cheaper. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ The black screen issue kind of negates anything else ;) Michael Hannigan What's the "black screen issue"? Carson Saldanha YOU WANT THE PIXEL TO HAVE THE A10 CHIP?? BHAAAAAAAHAHAHA My name is…. No, i want it to have a cheaper price, or be better somehwere else, like the Galaxy. STOP BEING RUDE Carson Saldanha https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CYF7C6hVAAAKF-_.jpg Tr3ple Shut up troll ,nobody likes you I see lmao My name is…. You know when you see the dumb guy, he always adds 'lol' or 'lmao' at the end of his sentence. And his syntax is always wrong. STFU and GTFO Liam Bulkley "You know when you see the dumb guy... And his syntax is always wrong." "You are an [sic] ignorant" Don't cut yourself on the glass. Michael Hannigan They have that - The Nexus 5x. Тарас Мукин You keep hating Pixel in the comments, but you only look at numbers. But they doesn't matter when it comes to Google. Software experience does. My name is…. That's a stupid argument Тарас Мукин And saying that somebody's argument is stupid without any explanation is a much smarter argument. My name is…. Would you pay 900$ bucks for Nexus 5 just because "Software experience matters"?? Carson Saldanha Nobody said they were paying just for the "software experience" Matt Tapac said that specs don't matter, the software experience does. That heavily implies that people are paying for the software experience. Carson Saldanha xD here we go again drunken_bastard Pixel and Pixel XL have better cameras and screens than any iPhone. The difference in SoC and other bits of hardware, they don't translate into any real world speed differences. Pixel also has great battery life. Perhaps some hands on time may do you some good. supersanborn Given that they continually sell out of the limited stock they have, none of what you cited matters. If they had a ginormous supply of units and THEN couldn't sell, then perhaps you would be on to something. My name is…. What was the availability in the first place? You think they produced many? No way Jose, i bet Galaxies and iphones outsold pixels by multiple times supersanborn We don't exactly know what they had hoped to produce or even what they actually produced, so your point remains conjecture. And who here is suggesting that Samsung and Apple phones didn't outsell the Pixel? My name is…. * by multiple times James Betti Sadly, Google isn't keeping the Pixel in stock because they don't care about their hardware line. Google makes most of its money through ads and personal data. It's a shame, but it explains why they discontinue successful products and barely have much in stock. Excellent phone by the way. Michael Hannigan Well, that's easy to rectify. Do like Amazon and offer the same exact hardware with "special offers" for a lower price. Then you get to see ads everywhere, even your home screen and app drawer. Pretty cool. Michael Hannigan Yes, they did. It was in the millions. Max "no real camera progress compared to nexii, meh battery life, meh screen." Ok, so you don't have a Pixel, we get it. My name is…. I'm not dumb, do you get that too? Xchris I think the consensus here is that you are talking bollocks. The pixel XL has an unbelievably good screen, one of the best battery life figures, still has the best camera out of any smartphone. Nobody who bought the pixel cares that much about any of your other points. In fact, what you are really saying is that you didn't like the pixel. Big deal! My name is…. Actually, i'm fighting the pixel in a nerdy community. Its expected that the consensus is that "i am talking bollocks". People here mainly wanna root their phones and put center clocks on status bar. they did the same with Nexii devices, its all about the software, but those phones were seriosly lacking (i used to own all Nexus devices after 4) Carson Saldanha So may I ask, what phone do you use now? My name is…. 1+3 Carson Saldanha Srsly!?!? Bruh, the OnePlus 3 has a Snapdragon 820 while the Pixel has a 821, a far better camera, better performance, and software. How is the OP3 better than the Pixel? Besides the price? I could probably understand if you had the OP3T, but no way. My name is…. You are an ignorant. 1) Check the speedtests, 1+3 is faster (because better nand) 2) Software is better on 1+3 (aosp with tiny mods) 3) Pixel has underclocked 821, thus 820 with a little bit of better battery life (1+3 has 1080p screen to tie this up) 4) 1+3 has 6gb ram (will be good for 4 years) 5) 1+3 is smaller than pixels, unbelievably thin 6) 1+3 has dash charging (world leading) 7) 1+3 has half the price 8) 1+3T is another story, far better Apply cream to the burn, son PS Yes Pixel has a better camera. Carson Saldanha Ignorance at it's finest. My name is…. Those are all FACTS, son. My name is…. Where are you, son? Jack Smith Have you ever even used a Pixel? Only Android phone i have used with zero touch lag. Can we also stop the name calling? Mason Andrew Maseda Hate to break it to you man. I own The One Plus 3T the Google Pixel the Nexus 6P and the Moto X pure edition. Lol. Guess witch one is my daily driver? The Pixel. Why? Better battery . Better cam. All around the most reliable phone. Even with my Nexus 6P I've had some issues here and there tiny ones. Like some days my battery life was abnormally shit and the next day it was great. The one plus 3T has tiny issues too. The Pixel is a phone that you wouldn't understand UNLESS YOU TRY ONE FOR A DAY. come back when you do. tansuperman Not sure why people think the pixel takes good pics. I have a pixel xl, 950xl, IPhone 7plus, and now the s8. In my opinion the pixel xl takes the worst pics. The lumia 950xl is stop dog. The pixel I can tell is just too overprocessed Michael Hannigan I think it applies mostly to low light pictures - absolutely nothing touches the Pixel in that respect - trust me. More generally, it applies to the software and hardware working together to create stunning (real) HDR pictures. But in low.light, which according to a friend of mine who is a smartphone camera freak (I am not), quality of low light pictures are what users are primarily interested in because he says "...any recent smartphone can take great pictures in daylight.". For me, I liked the flexibility of the V20 camera - not just the dual lenses, but the absolutely fantastic functions in the camera app. D13H4RD2L1V3 Um, the 821 consumes less power than the 820 at the lower clocks due to a more efficient binning process. Also, both the Pixel and OP3 use UFS 2 controllers. But on Nougat, the 3 uses F2FS for its filesystem. It's not a case of better NAND. It's a case of different filesystems. Michael Hannigan I think they should use FAT16. I miss it. Chris Rey I will say the Axon 7 is just as good as the OnePlus 3 and looks better. Suicide_Note The Pixel camera is definitely superior to what was in the 6P, and i say that as someone who currently owns them both. M. Luciano I use both on a daily basis. Agree with you 100%. So do objective measurements of the cameras. Pixel is the best on the market; 6P is decent but not great. andy_o On paper both cameras should be just short of identical, but the Pixel is so much faster in processing cause of the HVX dedicated core, plus the N6P throttles like crazy (in one of my photospheres tests in a warm room the Nexus 6 beat it every time). This is crucial especially with Google who is prioritizing computational photography probably on par or more with hardware camera specs. Also, I'm not sure if this is a hardware or artificial limitation, but HDR+ auto has completely different behavior on the Pixels. I can understand how someone who has only looked at the specs and not used a Pixel and N6P (especially in the summertime), can think that there's been "no real camera progress", but this guy is balls-deep in the "arrogance of ignorance". Michael Hannigan I think the reason for the difference in HDR+ in the Pixel is that it's" real HDR - it takes several pictures and then layers them. Other phones have taken a shortcut do doing that with one picture and it really doesn't achieve the same. Except in one case - manually setting HDR in my Note 7 gave absolutely stunning night time photos. Something I can't quite achieve with the built in software on the Pixel (but can with Photoshop). andy_o I was talking the difference between HDR+ auto in the Pixel and HDR+ auto in the previous phones. The auto behavior in the Pixel is different, but the HDR+ processing is basically the same. There's more info here: http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/11/21/deep-dive-closer-look-google-pixels-camera/#What_does_HDR_do If you feel nerdy enough I can link you to a paper on HDR+ by the Google computational photography team too :) Regarding the other phone cameras, the reason they do worse isn't exactly that they they're taking shortcuts, it's actually because they're doing it the traditional way, taking different exposures. Read the AP article linked above for details on how HDR+ is fundamentally different. Michael Hannigan You have OLED burn-in? I have about 8 hours SOT/day and don't have any. That would piss me off. Jason B Inverting colors for a bit while doing some extended reading helps. Black background with white text is easier on the eyes too. But yeah, static nav bar and notification area aren't great for OLED. There should be auto pixel shift to prevent it ... or Google should make more use of Immersive Mode. whispy_snippet Ugh. Like a broken fucking record here sometimes. Shawn Spring While some of your other points may/may not be valid, to say that the Pixel had "no real camera progress compared to nexii" just makes you sound ignorant. The S821 ISP alone would make the camera in the Pixel superior, not to mention the updated HDR algorithms. Get a Pixel owner and a 6P owner in the same room (I was both) and ask them to shoot with each others phone and see who prefers which. The 6P camera lag in HDR mode was inefficient at best and unbearable at worst. And it wasn't that long ago that OnePlus was using a broken invite system, had people lick their phones, and had a horribly gender insensitive marketing campaign. I'd probably not hold them up as the standard bearer against Google. Michael Hannigan They had people lick their phones? Why did they never ask me to do that? That's discrimination. I should have been asked to lick my phone. Brett Lewis I love my pixel after coming from a HTC 8x on Windows platform. Never liked Apple and never will. And lately after all the talk of Samsung's products (blowing up, red screens, other problems) I'm quite happy with my pixel. I don't need water proofing I'm not an idiot that takes my phone near water.. the I hardly notice the bezels after coming from a 4.3 inch 720 display.. The htc8x had one of the widest angle front cameras but I dont take selfies. This pixel does what I want and is fast doing it. And for first time experiencing Android I'm quite happy with buying this with the newest and best version available. TheHater So only idiots take their phones near water? I bet if you had a water resistant phone, you'd take it near water. Michael Hannigan What about the toilet? Who doesn't read the news when sitting on the shitter? Mariano Moreira I would definitely agree in terms of the Pixel XL vs iPhone 7 plus comparisons (Non-32GB model) Comparing the base iPhone 7 vs base Pixel...the iPhone 7 base had(has) slow Nand performance from what I have witnessed. The 32GB iPhone 7 vs base 32GB Pixel (5") seems like a closer comparison where the compromise is better battery life on the Pixel, faster Nand, and better screen. Again, I concur that looking at the Pixel XL vs iPhone 7 Plus leans more heavily towards Apple especially when comparing the 128GB models. Michael Hannigan If you buy from the Google store, they are carrier agnostic - absolutely 0 carrier bloatware. Mariano Moreira No. I have a Google Play(Bootloader unlocked) purchased Pixel. Normally used on Sprint or At&t. When I activate on Verizon: to get Vo-LTE calling with Verizon SIM and certain carrier settings it does a software update switching the phone over to the Verizon specific software build. If it was truly Carrier-agnostic it wouldn't force a Carrier specific Software build onto my non-Verizon model Pixel. Michael Hannigan You must have either bought it from Verizon or screwed something up. An unlocked phone doesn't suddenly become carrier specific like you describe Mike John Quincy Adams I don't one person who owns or says ’I sure wish I had a OnePlus.' Michael Hannigan I have - when I had the OnePlus One. Many people asked me about it. You can't deny that OnePlus phones offer an unbeatable value. They don't skimp on specs and sell for half the.price they should. asrat_24 I get you're trying to make fun of that guy but don't make ignorant statements while trying to do it. Oneplus makes good phones and people are interested enough nowadays to say that. Major Sceptic Agree on all points , a mid range device with a flagship price , perhaps Google will adjust the prices on the 2 ? for a company trying to expand it's phone sales it's going a funny way about it . Artem Russakovskii Well, usually at that point you start seeing significant discounts, but the Pixel is a misnomer in that regard to due to low stock and high demand. Max Exactly, I would revise that affirmation to state: "I've always felt once we are less than 6 months from the new iteration, it's a mistake to buy the existing product *at full price*." supersanborn I'll grant there's a case to be made for some phones where waiting can result in substantial discounts (especially from HTC/LG/etc). Probably a little of my bias sneaks in here. I prefer to have the newer device, and if I waited 6 months post-launch, it probably means I myself need to wait until the next launch. Max I'm with you there, I usually buy a phone at launch or a couple of months later at most but remember that we aren't regular customers, that's why we read and comment on this site ;). For many people out there it makes more sense to buy a phone six months after release if it comes with a nice worthy discount. M. Luciano This ^^ supersanborn Agreed, for some, shaving $100-200 off the price is all that matters. I usually caution folk pretty hard in the last 3 months before the new iteration drops if they have any form of new feature/size/color envy. supersanborn And yeah, I'm nowhere near the "normal" consumer :-) needa Supposed to be picking up a 32gb XL (Google) for $450 near mint in a couple hours. I might not get it, but a killer deal nonetheless. M. Luciano Smash that deal :) Very nice. needa A few little scratches on the back glass. Profit.

The lowest I've seen on Swappa was $695 for a black XL. supersanborn True. I usually find that the discounts are kind of on the "meh" side though until we hit release of new product. I always basically tell folks that you either buy it at launch until about 6ish months post-launch, and if you've held off that long, you should just wait until next launch and either buy the old product at a big discount or buy the new one. Matt I believe your use of misnomer was a bit of a misnomer. Artem Russakovskii I did use the wrong word, you're right. el_smurfo That's why I just picked up a 6p last year for $400. Most expensive smartphone I've ever bought, but the full release price was just not in my budget. Karly Johnston Battery issues? MisterAlex Maybe an anomaly... but not a misnomer. paxmos Where is this high demand you guys talk about?, I have yet to see a pixel in anyone's hand M. Luciano Really? I know over a dozen people who have or had them. paxmos Yep...I see lots of iPhones and Sammy's, even one Blackberry Z30, have only seen a pixel in the Verizon store. M. Luciano I feel like a nerd owning 4 Major Sceptic It does seem to have more of an enthusiast following , no shortage of pixels in my region , the usual brands , apple, Samsung, still seem to have the sales , I know not one person that has a pixel or wants one , and I think Google only has itself to blame on that front, Re : the cost of a pixels . Goblin Shark Finally, someone who knows what they're taking about - my head is just shaking in disbelief reading what these marshmallow brains that think they know about phones are saying on this comment thread lol Daishi Exactly. I have yet to see a Pixel in the wild. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ To be fair, HTC isn't used to such a high demand for their phones. Google unfortunately paid the price Daishi This made me LOL! A post full of WIN for sure!! Zoglog Actually it's probably because of all the RMA's they've gotten JD Thought that was obvious. syxbit I wonder whether we shouldn't wait for Pixel + 2. The next Pixel may technically be the first Google made product (current Pixel is made by HTC), so it's possible the Pixel 2 will have first gen problems. Still, I still have the N6P (after I scoffed at the Pixel price and refused to buy it), so I going to be looking for a phone soon. Good_Ole_Pinocchio HTC is also manufacturing the Pixel 2. Word on the street. Daishi That's too bad. I'll avoid this this phone as well... Captain On! Well, technically the iPhone is made by Foxconn, so... Don't expect Google to actually build their own facilities to produce hardware. Carson Saldanha Pretty sure they'll still be using HTC. Might have more control over the design this time around though. 4Ui812 The availability issue is a play out Nintendo's handbook. Good_Ole_Pinocchio 100% agree with the entire article... Do I want the Pixel Software Experience and Camera? Yes... But not when the new version is a few months away thag would probably fix all the issues I see posted on this site ever so often...starting with the Bluetooth issues. I got an S8... Because it's the only phone thay makes sense to me right now..... I'll see what Google is doing in the fall Max Johnson If the Moto G5 Plus had NFC I would have no problem making it my Android daily driver for the next 6 months. wade_county Moto Z Play and OP3/OP3T are other options with NFC. shadowx360 I used to buy 1 generation old Nexus devices to get around the cost issue, but it seems the 5X and 6P both are plagued by serious phone-killing issues. Now that warranty is up on nearly every used 5X/6P, buying used is like trying to navigate a minefield. I don't really trust 1st generation Pixel to not have serious issues either. I'd never use a non-Pixel/Nexus device but I can't buy a Pixel XL knowing Samsung offers so much better hardware at a similar price. wade_county My advice is getting the next OnePlus phone or picking up a used OP3/OP3T. AndrewGM I bought a used Pixel in good shape on eBay, as I couldn't get one from Google Store (already had a wireless provider). Switched from an iPhone 6s, after using almost every iPhone model since and including the original. Much better camera on the Pixel, especially closeups and in low light, and much easier to use overall (especially Contacts vs. iOS), as I've used mostly Google apps for a long time. I like the Google keyboard much better and the Android interface. I'm definitely satisfied with the Pixel and have no real iPhone regrets. It's true there are more apps for the iPhone, but that doesn't matter because the core apps are available on Android too. The only app I miss is Enlight, for photo editing. The one Pixel issue I agree with is the relatively poor resale value vs. iPhones (I assume). Carson Saldanha May I suggest Snapseed for photo editing? (It's developed by Google) Also, do you miss iMessage/FaceTime or is that really a con? AndrewGM Will check out Snapseed, thanks. I've been using Google Photos to lightly edit pics. The Pixel camera is so good that I often don't edit (for Instagram/FB uploads), especially if the light and composition are already good. I don't miss iMessage at all. I had to turn it off and all that stuff for my phone number when I switched, but I'm texting away every day. Emoticons seem to work fine. I don't even think about iMessage. FaceTime has been replaced with Duo for my family members, including those on iPhone. Seems to work fine. And I can share location with family members via Google Maps. I guess that brings up privacy issues vs. using Apple products, but not sure it makes a real-world difference. Battery life, btw, seems pretty good (I charge the phone overnight only). The call quality is a little less than iPhone, maybe, but overall acceptable. AndrewGM Will add that I have had the Pixel for 2 months and use it daily. I like the screen on the Pixel (or at least it never bothers me), and the issue about the "chin" at the bottom being big is a non-issue to me. I don't notice it and in fact hold the phone sometimes there, which is arguably convenient. If the phone continues to hold up, I'll be a customer for Pixel 2 eventually. Eric I was ready to jump to the Pixel XL after returning my second Note 7, but Google never gave me the opportunity to give them my money. Carson Saldanha xD My name is…. It was never a good device. thank you for finally admitting that. Andrew I don't think that's what the author is saying... My name is…. Someone had to be crazy to buy a pixel in the first place. I was bashing on that device from day one. Author, months later, says that the phone is no good. It was never good. Carson Saldanha Lord, would you just chill? Tr3ple I think he's retarded, gotta be it, lol. Must be it actually. Carson Saldanha troll by far Suicide_Note Except that's not at all what the author said, so you're either: A) trolling, B) incredibly dumb, or C) both of the above. Тарас Мукин Of course there's no point in buying Pixel for full price now. And there's more: there's no point in buying any device for it's starting price when it's 3 months old — tech gets old really fast today. And that's the whole point of not buying something at day one — everything gets much cheaper very fast. Samsungs do, LGs too. But Pixel for some reason didn't. And Nexuses were like this too. So — only buying Google devices right after release makes sense. Or buying them unofficially and cheaper. Sad, but true. sraj49 I always like and respect your articles. You put your views straight forward. But I tend not to agree with the tone and content of this article completely. I am living in Home of full Apple products and I own a Pixel XL. I love the Pixel in all aspects. Yes there are room to improvements which is true for everyone. Apple products are well designed, well built. As regards sorry gone are those days when Apple sorry was at is best which was until iPhone 4s/ iPhone 5. Now after the warmth period it is the same as Pixel. I going Pixel after sales support very good. I definitely agree with you on the most inefficient handling of supplies and also this is not the time to buy since meet models are coming. Just to add, I get sick when people say that the Pixel phones are not made by Google but by HTC. Everyone outsources manufacturing. Most of the phone are made by Foxcon staying from Apple. All phone manufacturers only design the hardware, software and the manufacturing is outsourced. Good_Ole_Pinocchio The HTC point that keeps coming up comes from the fact that Google didn't really dsign much hardware hete. They just used HTC parts. It's not the same as hardware being designed by apple then manufactureres elsewhere. andy_o I think he's right on that point. Google support may or may not be good, but it's online only. Apple support is famously good. For instance, the recent fixes for iPhone 6s battery problems. I booked an appointment, went into the store, they told me it would be a bit, went to a coffee shop, they emailed me, picked it up. Another time my iPad mini 2 mute switch broke. Again, appointment, go in the store, got it actually just exchanged on the spot. Google simply cannot do that. JohnyNoLegs What android phones have you owned prior to the pixel? And yes it's a HTC phone through and through. Scofabear Shots fired! I even dumped my 6P for a Moto z play. No regrets Futbolrunner Same here! That 808 was a lag fest. I even got the S8+ but returning it because it can't touch the Play's battery life. Dominic D I just bought a Pixel a month ago. I still would recommend it if you get one for fairly cheaply on swappa. It's awesome. Brian Demodulated My last 3 phones have been Nexus. Each has been less reliable than the last. I love how hackable they are but I think my next phone will be a Samsung Galaxy. Carson Saldanha Elaborate? Wdym by "less reliable" What issues? Brian Demodulated My Samsung Galaxy Nexus was incredible and still works today. My Nexus 5 was garbage - two broke within 1.5 years. My 6P is quirky - it doesn't charge on my home PC and although my wife's updated to 7.1.2 mine says it's up to date at 7.1.1. Tr3ple Get a pixel then, Samsung lol. Brian Demodulated I have my 6P another year. I'll see what's available next year when my contract is up. JohnyNoLegs Bootloops, dodgy updates, requires factory resets, breaks features, slow bug fixes. M. Luciano No offense, but you are not going to increase stability by going to Samsung. Brian Demodulated My old Samsung Galaxy Nexus was the best, highest quality, most reliable phone I ever owned. LG and Huawei's Nexus phones were less stable for me. M. Luciano I had a few of those.. they weren't as reliable. But probably because I did bad things to them. Brian Demodulated I rooted mine, loaded hacky ROMs, and carried it with me everywhere I went for 3 years. The USB and audio cables are a little loose now but otherwise it's saved me when my later Nexus phones crapped out on me. Vitali Galaxy nexus had clean stock rom, it is just Google's clean soft in a Samsung physical device and not with samsung's os Brian Demodulated Every Nexus has the clean stock ROM. It's one of the top reasons why I get them. JohnyNoLegs Going Pixel sure doesn't increase stability. It's less stable than my Note 4/Note 7. Vitali Agree with M. Luciano, but people try should move to Sony. Lookup at speed test videos of their Xperia XZs, it has beaten all smartphones by now, including the Pixel. All the biased big reviewers out there will never tell you the truth, stop thinking the S8 is the best phone in the world.. I recommend you to wait for their Xperia XZ Premium it will have sd835! After you see the XZs speed, I promise you it may be the fastest phone even in 2018. Suicide_Note No. Just...no. Vitali *A wild 8 year old fanboy comment appears* Brian Demodulated Speed isn't that important to me. I've heard bad things about Sony's flavour of Android and that it's bloaty. Vitali So you heard wrong, their software is one of the bests out there, and im talking from experience.. And Samsung have so clean and fast Android that it is just unbelievable.. Where do you get all that info from?? Vitali So you heard wrong, their software is one of the bests out there, and im talking from experience.. And Samsung have so clean and fast Android that it is just unbelievable.. "I've heard.." Where do you get all that info from?? Suicide_Note TW is much better than it used to be, but it's hardly clean and fast. Brian Demodulated I work in a large IT department. One of my buddies told me about it. He said Sony's Android UI was all over the place and annoying to use, and that his handset was 2 major versions behind the latest version of Android OS. dtox Lol don't listen to him, xperia phones are absolute trash. dtox LOL xperia = garbage D13H4RD2L1V3 Um, I'm not entirely sure. Not that I'm ragging Sony, but they haven't exactly been selling for a reason. Even Sony themselves know. I don't hate Sony phones. I personally think they're understated, solid offerings. Problem was that they were really overpriced. After seeing the XZs and XA1, seems like their pricing may have become more logical. We'll see how it goes. I'm personally hoping the XZP may even be a solid device. Not that I'll buy one but if the price is right, it'll be significantly easier to recommend. JSo Experiences differ from person to person. But It's odd the luck you have had with the Nexus devices. I've had the Galaxy Nexus, Nexus 5 and now the Nexus 5X and I have never had an issue with any of them. JohnyNoLegs No battery issues with 5X? My wifes upgraded to 7.1.1 and has never been the same, bluetooth is slow and laggy, and the battery barely gets 1.5-2 hours SOT after it used to get close to 3. Michael Hannigan Dude, you're talking about a crusty old obsolete phone. And unless you are happy getting 2 hours of battery time, you should pry the wallet open and buy something current. Complaining about your old phone won't make you feel better. Replacing it with a working, current phone that's not past it's expected useful life will. JohnyNoLegs Dude, wth are you talking about. It's a 1.5 years old. From new it was getting 4-5, right up until 7.1.1 update. Roy My 6P is the most reliable phone ever. And I had Samsung and HTC. Duder12 The last Nexus phones had bum processors from qc. royrov My Nexus 6P kissed the asphalt a couple of weeks ago, so I bought a perfect Pixel XL second hand (used 3-4 months). Its better, no regrets here. Faster and better battery, hell even snapchat is snappy on it! Tr3ple Exaclty lol, people saying the pixel isn't an upgrade to the 6p are delusional lol. They all like to hate on it u til they get one and realize how good of a phone it is. And all the bugs I've been seeing on the net are nowhere to be found and I had mine for 5-6 months now bekifft I know it's an upgrade. It's just not much of an upgrade for an enormous amount of money. Tr3ple My 6p had serious issues, I went and got a s7 egde(big mistake), the price I paid was well worth it. I'm still financing my s7 egde while I'm using a pixel, this is how much I love this phone. destinyhud I will still buy one Michael Tran If I could give you a phone for free but you had to keep it and use it and couldn't sell it. Which phone would it be? M. Luciano 128 GB Pixel XL, black supersanborn My 128GB Pixel XL in black. At least until the 2 comes and **hopefully** adds waterproofing, 600Mhz support, 4x4MIMO for T-Mobile. If you're reading, Pixel team, let's talk! Orlando aka Pixel XL Samsung Galaxy S8+ blue Tr3ple Gimme a 128 gb pixel XL black any day keithzg The bezels really are due for a shrink. Boy are you gonna rue this when the second-gen comes out and the bezels are the exact same ;) M. Luciano I sorta hope they are :) keithzg You animal! (But honestly, this is why choice is good. I find the desire for those top and bottom bezels incomprehensible, but I can entirely understand that not everyone would feel the way I do, particularly if routinely holding phones very differently.) M. Luciano I just want SOME bezels. They don't need to be huge. Just want a place to put my thumbs when holding it sideways. It's a good place for speakers IMO. Carson Saldanha Nah, to be fair, I think Google's definitely not planning on keeping them the same size if they've listened to the reviews. keithzg I mean, if they'd listened to reviews of many other phones before they put out the Pixels they would have known that too---including, for instance, the previous two generations of Nexus phones . . . So it seems likely that either (a) they know of the opinions of the commentariat and disagree, or (b) they felt technically they couldn't do it. I'm personally hoping it was somehow just (b) but they used (a) to convince themselves that it was an okay sacrifice, but that they won't have to make the same sacrifice again this year and they'll allow themselves to change up the design. But I'm not gonna bet too much money on that. Carson Saldanha Whoa, you lost be there with all those "a's" and "b's" xD Shawn Spring I think its pretty well known at this point that the time frame between when Google's negotiations w/Huawei fell through and when they picked the deal up with HTC was the cause of the "let's use the leftover A9 shells" bezel issue. So more (b) than (a) assuredly. ikeofkc If they do. Peoples' thumb muscles are going to be screwed if they use the pixel 1 handed, constantly trying to reach the back button. The chin makes one handed use possible keithzg See, that's what I mean about different folks and different strokes. I've never noticed it being of any help with my Nexus 6P, for me the top and bottom bezels are completely useless. bekifft If they actually put something useful there, like a front facing stereo speaker, I would be totally fine with that. keithzg Dammit, don't you go making me miss the Nexus 6 again! Michael Hannigan I want them to be bigger. I want to be able to lean on mine when I am standing in line at a movie. MadMartigan I am constantly amazed by the short memories. The author thinks it likely they are likely to have a better launch of P2? They do give the obvious impression that they believe the Pixel to be their first swing and a miss... Funny how quickly we forget, well, nearly every other device Google has ever tried to sell. I personally loved my 4, 10, 5, 6, and 6. But I cannot, while keeping a straight face, argue that one should expect anything better from them regarding inventory management this time around. How many times does Google have to fail on inventory management before we start pointing and laughing at the people who constantly say, "They'll get it right this time, for sure." Don't get me wrong - I would absolutely love it if Google proved me wrong on the P2. I just won't believe it until I see it. //dons flameproof suit// A'ight, I'm ready. Fire away... M. Luciano This is their first swing and a miss, but only because the shortages are for very different reasons than prior devices they sold on behalf of other OEM's. MadMartigan Who...who do you think made the Pixels? M. Luciano Google is the OEM for the Pixel phones (and tablets, and laptops, etc). HTC is the factory putting the phones together. It's a totally different legal and business agreement, and essentially means that Google has to supply most of the components, contracts, contacts, etc. and HTC is essentially an assembly line. On Nexus phones, the OEM was Samsung, or LG or Huawei, etc. and they actually designed and produced the phones, in partnership with and input from Google. Completely different. For those, the partner was able to do all the contracting and sourcing; HTC isn't doing all the work for Google this time. MadMartigan So you don't believe HTC designed the Pixel. Got it. That's all I needed to see. M. Luciano Not sure what that means, but ok. Google is now the OEM, that's what I am saying. Another Scott Nice post. I hemmed and hawed about a Pixel XL 128 for 6 weeks last fall and finally decided I just couldn't do it. Besides the fact that it was impossible to get from Google, I just couldn't justify the price. I decided to finally replace my LG Nexus 4 (roughly $350 new) with a new T-Mobile LG V10 from B&H in November for $330 and am quite pleased. (It would have been $300 a week or so later.) I added a Samsung EVO 128 GB SDHC card for it for $40 or so. I miss the Nexus timely updates a great deal, but I can't see spending a kilobuck on a phone to get it - especially for only a 2 year OS upgrade availability. I hope Google gets the Pixel 2 right, but maybe they figure having a "premium" phone for evangelists is good enough so they won't feel any pressure to make it available (or cut the price). Cheers, Scott. fijisiv The Galaxy S8+ is $20 less than a 128GB Pixel XL Just wow. M. Luciano Right? The Pixel is by far a better value at those prices. 128 GB storage over 16, metal over glass body, better software, better security, better camera, guaranteed to be up to date for 3 years... Samsung has some great components, but as a package, Pixel seems to keep ahead at this point. Matt I believe the S8+ is 64G and has a microSD slot. M. Luciano I think you're right. IMO that makes the Pixel better. Do you prefer less with expandable option? 03grunt I live in the mountains of NC and went back to Verizon once they brought back unlimited data and luckily the local Verizon store had a Pixel XL. I think it's pretty sad that in ~ 18 months the Pixel will be EOL. M. Luciano Luckily, it won't be. Nexus and Pixel devices are guaranteed to be fully up to date for 3 years; not 2. 2 years of major updates and 3 years of security updates = 3 years of being fully up to date. Sir_Brizz That's not entirely true. They are only guaranteed to be on the latest version for 2 years. It's unlikely it will be any different than the Nexus 6 in this regard (which didn't get 7.1 but is still getting monthly security updates). M. Luciano The Pixel and Pixel XL released October 4, 2016. They're guaranteed to be fully up to date until 10/31/2019. That's 1121 days, or 3.07 years. Sir_Brizz No. You are wrong. They are only guaranteed version updates until October 2018. The Nexus 6 was guaranteed the same thing until October 2016. It did not get Android 7.1 even though it continues to get monthly security updates. What this means is that the Pixel will get at least Android 9.0 but that doesn't guarantee it will get 9.1 or 9.2 or anything else past that. It just means it will get 9.0 and monthly security updates to 9.0 for an additional year. M. Luciano I get what you're saying, but it also launches on the latest update. So using the Pixel, it launches with N, will get O after a year, will get P after a year and then is not guaranteed to get Q. Are we really going to get a Q? So during each of those three updates, N, O and P, it on the latest OS and getting monthly security updates. 2 years of updates, so long as it includes the 2nd major OS update, translates to three full years. Ever since they started the annual number and letter update, we're essentially talking about a single API version update per year (2016 had 2, including the one you're referencing which impacted Shamu). Sir_Brizz I've already pointed this out twice: look at the Nexus 6 for a first hand example of how this is going to work. The Nexus 6 will not be on the latest version of Android for three years because it is already not on the latest version of Android despite getting monthly security updates. 03grunt Thanks for clarifying! Chris Kiederer As a Nexus 5X/project Fi user, right now the Pixel is my only choice if my Nexus decides to blow up like many before it. I really hope this Android one rumor heading to the US is true, as it would give project Fi subscribers more than just a really expensive option to stay on the plan Andye82 But exactly one year from today it will be still extremely difficult if not impossible to get your hands on pixel 2 Mix "Persistent stock issues have plagued Google's first "in-house" handset from day one..." I am on my 3rd phone and I still wonder, every time I use it, if it will be like my last two phones. I have phone PTSD! Google should just pull a Nintendo and just stop producing and move on to the 2 but not fuck it up. John Doe Great job on the article, now I will be waiting for the editorial on Google's software update policy LoL PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Google's inexperience producing a smartphone They had great experience running Motorola. Ammar "Sure, Google got some things astoundingly right: the performance, the camera, the larger software experience" To be honest, these are the only reasons why I'd ever get a Pixel over any other Android phone. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ I agree with some of Radar's points as well as teh main one as I've *never* recommended the XL because I know that the vast majority of people are sheep-like followers and/or technophobes, and I defifnitely don't want part of the onus for a technophobe's major purchase that they're going to rue the second that an iPhoner mocks them. The Pixel sells itself to PowerUsers on its own merit, which, AEB the popularity of inferior and/or questionable top-sellers, clearly supports my previous assertions. JPLoureiro Deciphering of your sentences will commence............. now. Futbolrunner What? Marty I never was going to buy an HTC Pixel. Don't like HTC and the build quality doesn't deserve such a high price. jawsnnn My SOs Pixel is probably the buggiest Google phone I have used till date. The Google Assistant, voice search are consistently broken and the phone doesn't offer much else in way of justifying it's price. Will definitely buy an OEM phone next. Google's hardware experiment is dead for me. Tim Harman I wish I'd read this 2 weeks ago! Oh well. I've got a Pixel now and I do love it. I live in NZ and the version I ended up with is the American one, which means that while it supports all my LTE bands, it doesn't support Carrier Aggregation on the bands used here. So that's my excuse for why I simply MUST HAVE the P2 when it's released. Damian Stuart Wow, what a load of crap! The Pixel is a superb phone with issues affecting small numbers of devices. I have one, after moving away from the Samsung range. I have had no issues and as I don't ever intend to take a phone swimming haven't got a single complaint about it. But haters gonna hate. sebastianer @David Ruddock Don't forget the terrible compass. If you grab an iPhone 5S and a Pixel. Open Google Maps in both of them. An you start walking trough dense downtowns the whole day (closing / opening maps at different places). You will see that the Pixel compass accuracy is constantly changing every time you open maps and is a total mess while the 5S is perfectly accurate after 1-2 seconds and less than one step. I hope the next Pixel has a completely new sensor...or compass or whatever. Last 3-4 Google Phones were a mess. I think the last Google phone with more or less good compass was the galaxy nexus but I can't even remember now TechGuy22 i'm selling mine soon since i know i can sell it around 600 dollars and it's the 128GB wjrandon So glad I kept my Nexus 6P for a second year... and look at those rock solid resale values. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9d5926ba5094521287d1d54e2476d3852462178bdf74a16166f94742b435213c.jpg TechGuy22 i sold mine for 500 dollars and i bought it used too lol that's how i managed to get the XL 128GB eric messenger It depends on what phone your coming from. For most android users it is a great phone with a great camera. If your coming from an iPhone the pixel is the first great alternative to an iphone. The on device support is actually awesome and they are very quick with support issues. I am used to Nexus devices plagued with serious issues that you had to work around and while they were great phones for the price I felt they all suffered (maybe not the 6P). Anyway the point is pixel raised the bar for Android and brought it up to par with Apple. It's probably still worth buying if you have to upgrade, and you can just get the pixel 3 in 2019 or 2020. Sean You can say this about any phone at the moment....wait for next gen. As a Project Fi user I am waiting on a phone that has the cell radio to take advantage of T-mobile's new 600mhz band they are quickly rolling out...and NO, it cant be done with a software update on any phone. me me "quickly rolling out"? The spectrum is sold but not available yet as the current user vacates.... Sean NOT TRUE....they are rolling it out in areas NOW where the old TV stations have already vacated the band. Google is your friend. me me finally, you realize it was crap, was always, still now, only thing now is you changed. Never worth the money, specs so-so for the price. Islam Google Pixel poor use of space. over-priced. BS Sean People that actually OWN one dont agree........ TechGuy22 i agree and i have one. sadly, it just stopped caring about the bezel since there's nothing i can do to make it look better VAVAMk_2 6P user here with a new battery happily waiting it out for Pixel 2. Sean Boot loop much? Ernie I have had my Nexus 6p since day one of the release. I have been lucky not to have encountered the boot loop or battery problems others have reported. I love my Nexus 6p. Hope it will get Android O. Phone_Addiction Pixel 2 probably going be the same story. Google will never learn. Dean F Marsh I love my Pixel XL! Invest in a good quality case and enjoy the phone. It's really pretty decent and for a few minor quirks mentioned, and none that I have experience yet, I can't be happier. From Nexus, HTC, Samsung, to Pixel XL, this has been the best so far. Ailín Ó’S I live in Ireland and Pixel isn't even available here yet which is odd given we were a launch country for Nexus 5x/6p but hey ho. Rick Schoonmaker This is just what I like to read after getting banged by Google and Huawei with the 6P bootloop issue 1 year and 2 days (read 2 days out of warranty) after buying and being told that my only option is to buy a new phone. So after being without a phone for a week, I had to buy a Pixel XL even though I really didn't want it and especially at the ridiculous price ($860 for 32Gb.. are you effing kidding?). Matt Definitely. I got a pixel XL the very first morning when it was available in local store. Great phone, camera, software. 2 months later, the phone began to behave crazily--extra hot, microphone malfunction. Called Google support for like 10 times and had it replaced, then I put the brand new replacement on local trade platform without hesitation. Google-brand is attatractive, but does not worth that rediculous amount of money. I can get a even better performed oneplus counterpart for almost half price. Anyway, I am on my moto x 2014 with lineage os 14 and i am pretty happy. It is sufficient for me to deal with my daily work. And I also suggest to wait for the release of more flagships from variant companies to have more flexible and reasonable options. Spinkick Google seems to not be able to follow through on anything these days. It just seems like if its not sexy or cool and needs actual work, they cant be bothered. Maybe they will release another chat app in the meantime.. 2 Men-E I want the Pixel 2 XXL (Taimen). It better exist as a 5.6"+ screened device. Philip Although if you're with TMobile. It's significantly cheaper to buy the Pixel, and get your money's worth. Granted the Pixel is guaranteed two years of support, it matches with TMobile promotion pay credit time. h4rr4r They offer a discount? I thought it was just financing. Philip Yep. $325 in TMobile bill credits over two years. Which is when the Pixel 3 will be out. So you buy a Pixel, get refunded about half of the cost. And then you're ready to upgrade to the third generation. belac77 shhh, David, I just listed my Pixel for sale on Swappa! ;) Mason Andrew Maseda This entire article is just terrible and written by someone just mad they don't have one. M. Luciano lol he got one the week after I did. He's had one. Adrianus Bratanata Supply and demand. As long as there is bigger demand than supply they don't need to reduce the price drunken_bastard I disagree. All the pros you mentioned for the Pixel -- pure Android experience, performence, camera, etc -- those are all the reasons why the Pixel and Pixel XL is still the best smartphone on the market. Worried a new one is going to come out? Happens with every flagship, every year. This one doesn't have the lastest SoC? I challenge you to demonstrate real world differences in actual speed versus the Galaxy S8, which is a gorgeous handset that yet again is crippled by bloated software and long standing issues that never seem to get addressed. You cite support potentially ending in October 2018 for software updates, but that's still a longer window than any other Android flagship, and you get them day one, which Samsung and LG don't. A smartphone is more than the sum of it's parts. It's an experience. I feel on that quality alone, the Pixel and Pixel XL are the best representations to date. NeMoDoSeZ I was going to buy a 128gb Pixel XL but due to not being available I ended up waiting and purchasing a Galaxy S8+. I'm now glad things ended up the way they did because I'm loving my S8+. Rod Until Android 8 is released. Then you'll like: fuck Samsung man! My U$xxx phone is outdated, goddamnit! Owen Iverson I hate the world of tech. We've now gotten used to NEEDING the latest thing IMMEDIATELY. Its why companies like Microsoft, Adobe, and Autodesk have switched to monthly/yearly subscriptions so you have to pay for the rest of your life. "The Bluetooth performance is horrid." What metric, speed? Connectivity? "It's not waterproof." Not sure that waterproof is a common trait among all high-end phones just yet. "The bezels really are due for a shrink." I've never used a bezel-less phone, where do you pick it up or hold it? Does your finger trigger anything on the edges? "The Snapdragon 821 is officially old news." What are you running where 1) you see lag and 2) that it's an actual problem. Maybe people are replacing consoles with their phones just like they're replacing their DSLRs with their phones? "it doesn't support proper advanced network features across all four of the big US carriers." What are these advanced network features? Anyway, I know it's a phone blog, so ... D13H4RD2L1V3 Well, he means that since its successor isn't far off, and that the Pixel is still not easy to get hold of, you might be better off waiting, since the Pixel is also selling at full price still. Edward jh How can the camera be great I mean what about the pixel camera lens flare issue plaguing 1000's of users. Margaritas Ante Porcos Pixel was a disaster. The worst phone for that price. I understand some of you got the Stockholm syndrome. But some of us see the clear picture. Google simply lost this round with both hands down. Dan Yurman My Google Pixel seems to have a mind of its owns. Here's what it does without my asking it - 1. shuts down randomly and has to be restarted by holding the power button and lower end of the volume rocker for about 15 seconds; 2. randomly starts different pieces of software including a suspiciously high frequency of instances of Google Play Music, which I have since disable, 3. Starts the flashlight from the pull down menu if the phone is placed face down on a shiny flat surface, 4 And randomly starts other programs after unlocking the phone with a pin. On the plus side the camera does good work and the phone is easily held in one hand and scrolled with fingers from the same hand while eating hit wings with the other. :-) Ray I'm very glad I read this article. I was on the fence - and almost pulled the trigger the other day but very glad I didn't now. I'll wait for the next gen and hopefully it's a much better piece of kit - and possibly cheaper. lomsha Whaaaat, you don't say. rockon999 My 2015 Moto X PE's display stopped functioning properly and I needed a new device to *function* in my daily life. So I bought a pixel, yesterday. To address your complaints... I never use Bluetooth on a phone, I'm getting a case, I'll hate the speakers (but I really only use headphones), I'm no bezel snob, and finally... waterproofing? My Moto X PE was waterproofed and I can honestly say it never aided me in one single way. Sure, it felt great using the phone in the rain that one time. But I'm fairly certain an encased pixel can survive that. I know it is probably a horrible value, but I really don't want to deal with buying a $200 phone now, selling it later for $100, and then buying a new $900 phone in a few months. I don't have time to constantly be reselling and selling my devices and I don't have a spare $100 to just throw around on a device. Slurms Mckenzie Seriously have been saying most of what this article is about since day one. I have a pixel XL and I've hated it since receiving it. It's not worth what Google asks when everything that is offered can be had for half the money (quick updates not included) for that asking price it should at least offer sd card support which is something even the most basic phones have. I've been using Nexus phones since the beginning (skipped the 6) and the problems with them were expected as it was a budget friendly phone but if you want to charge premium pricing don't use cloth for your ear piece cover, have dual speakers, and for God's sake don't make deals with the devil (Verizon) to lock down MIMO as a carrier specific feature when every damn phone is capable of and and most carriers are as well F*** you Pixel XL you sack of shit what a waste of 800 bucks Rod Best camera Google photos unlimited backup at original resolution Best performance Lowest touch latency of all Android phones "Just" that. micahthomas Basically all you're saying is wait if a new version is going to be released in 6 months. Might as well just say that, doesn't really have anything to do with if it's iPhone or Android. JG I was about to order my mother a 32GB Pixel a week or so ago to replace her Nexus 5X. I recently discovered the glass of its camera lens has a pretty decent crack in it. It doesn't seem to affect pictures - yet... But we're planning a fairly photogenic trip this summer and I figured the Pixel has a better camera and has unlimited free full resolution Google Photos uploads so... But as I was about to click the "Add to Cart" button, I thought we're not all that far from the expected October release of the Pixel 2. I'm sure mom wouldn't mind being a generation behind, but... derk p just replace the housing on hers. i bought a white one but then wanted a blue back... was cheap on ebay and is very easy to snap on and snap off dizel123 Relatively speaking we're not too far from October of next year for the Pixel 3. Or October 2019 for the Pixel 4... toast I never buy Apple, and I never buy Samsung. But both of their hardware just feel slicker than the Pixel. As the article says, knock a few hundred off the price, and I'd be a keen buyer, mainly for the camera and fast OS updates, and Google "Purity". I'll wait and see how the upcoming Moto Z and X phones turn out. Defenestratus It'll be difficult for me to go back to a Google phone after the nightmare that was my 6P. Major Sceptic Availability is no problem in my neck of the woods , and I appreciate the work Google did on the camera as a point and shoot and smooth software , but after looking at the pixels they looked a bit underwhelming in the feature department , and then as mentioned the outrageous​ prices for the pixels I wouldn't go near one . I might add with the smooth software , Google no longer has the Monopoly on as most devices with 7.0 onwards are very good . Rod What feature does it miss? redsoxwin I'm not sure what this person's agenda is, but this is great phone. Strange article. Amie Perry Porter I personally love my Pixel phone. Will Dutton I never cease to be amazed that everyone always thinks that 'the next one will fix it' with android John Quincy Adams Whining about bezels is ignorance. Without bezels, how do you hold it? . ..please, bezel whiners...answer this... gar216 I'm a happy Nexus 6p user. Even prior to launch I couldn't justify upgrading my 7 month old 6p to a Pixel XL. It would have clearly been an upgrade, but I didn't think it was enough of an upgrade for the price. Also... It's kinda ugly. SiliconAddic "The Google Pixel is a notoriously hard phone to get a hold of. Persistent stock issues have plagued Google's first "in-house" handset from day one, and things really are little to no better in the six months since the launch event. " Um BS. Google has ALWAYS his issues with distribution. The Nexus 5 had this issue, the Nexus 6 had this problem, the 6p also had this problem and now the pixel. Google is incompetent when it comes to this. Meanwhile Apple can launch a new phone and you can walk into any of their stores and pick one up. I wanted a Pixel to replace my Nexus 6, could not get one. I ended up with a S7 edge. Google and Nintendo should team up with their inability to ship jack ****. Eric How does this stand to affect the resale value / trade-in value for current pixel owners under project fi? I'm asking as someone who switched to project fi from Verizon prepaid in early January, and has almost been regretting it ever since. I am a quadriplegic in a power wheelchair to whom the pixel with Google Assistant seemed a natural front runner, due to its voice capabilities, and project fi with it's much touted multi Network and Wi-Fi hopping capabilities seemed a good decision as well. Did my due dilligence and the 4G network to all appearances covered me completely, even though I live with my elderly parents in a rural area. The only option available for order at the time was a white Pixel (not XL) and 32gb. I was nervous about the 32 part at the time, but felt comfortable with the infinite backup capability of Google photos. Now, 3 1/2 months later, not only is service spotty, audio crackly despite not being a candidate for replacement under the microphone bug, and Google's customer service... Let us politely say not the most helpful on the issue. I apologize about the length of this comment, (and after reading over it I really should have made it a direct message) but the difference between a phone worth $600 and the phone worth $300 in retail/tradein is quite a big deal to someone like me, and as much as I love my pixel (and admire/fear/respect Google) getting out while the getting is good is starting to sound the smarter move. ( especially after the 180 they made on the 5x.... Grrrrr) Was curious to get an educated opinion on the subject. Thanks again for your ( and anyone else's who has read this far) time and any insight offered! dizel123 Opinion: Even if you can, you probably shouldn't read David Ruddock's articles anymore. Adam Myself having been using the Pixel since day one, I would agree to an extent... Would I go out a purchase a brand new Pixel/Pixel XL for full retail? Of course not! Only because the new iteration is just around the corner. Now, would I go buy a Galaxy S8 or an iPhone 7? No way, wouldn't even consider it! I have switched phones at least every 6 months for the past 3 to 4 years, between Android and iOS operating systems as well... Having said that, the Pixel has been the best phone and best experience that I have had to date! This is the first time that I haven't thought about what phone I want to get next, and to be honest there would have to be significant improvements for me to even get the newest iteration when it comes out this fall. This phone as just been that good. To sum things up... I would not buy the Pixel/Pixel XL right now at full retail cost, I definitely would NOT go out and buy a Galaxy S8 or an iPhone either... If you, like myself, really love the Pixel line and want to get one and don't already own one. I would suggest trying to hold out and get the newest release this fall. It's most definitely worth the wait! D13H4RD2L1V3 Google always seems to have issues with stocking ever since the Nexus days. Pretty embarrassing that it's still hard to get a hold of one after 6 months. Probably due for a small price cut soon, as newer phones roll out. me me yeah I loved Nexus back with Nexus 4, 5, 7. Now the Nexus banner is carried by the likes of Moto G, OnePlus.... H2OSKI So true. The bluetooth issues alone nearly make this phone unusable. Drops and cutout's every 20 seconds. Get this, my Pixel was fine UNTIL Google sent out "the server side" update to fix the Bluetooth issues my phone never had!!! Thanks Google. Mine is going back this week. Great camera crap bluetooth. I take pics occasionally​ but I need to use a bluetooth headset hours a day. Multiple headphones, headsets, and vehicle connections with all the same result...even in safe mode. Fail. Daishi Google shot themselves in the foot when they gussied up an HTC 10 and called it a Pixel. It is just any other Android phone and doesn't have the support behind it to justify the price. Six months along, it should be more than 50% off. William Ross Why the hell is this idiot comparing a 6 month old device to the newer releases? A year in smartphone years is a lifetime. That being said, the pixel still has the best most up to date software bar none! The camera is still among the best if not the best. And, although the 835 is a newer processor, the 821 is no slouch. GTFOH with this garbage article. And, I'll definitely be getting the next Pixel regardless of price. And, I'll sell my original on eBay for a pretty penny. And, this baby has no scratches any where. It's always been in a case and all glass has been protected by Liquid Armor. diggie Pixel is a $650+ phone built like a budget chinese phone. And sorry, Oneplus has Google beat on OS features while keeping "stock" feel. William Ross Oh here we go again with the one plus fans always hating on the pixel. If your phone is so great then why knock the pixel? I just don't get it. Just talk about how great your actual Chinese knockoff is. No need to hate in the Pixel. The one plus has little more than a cult following and mock my words, it'll never be a mainstream device. me me Android Police and a lot of its customers are hating the Pixel. The OnePlus fans just chime in. I own a OP3T. It simply works, yep even Bluetooth. When take tax into account, its about half the price. OnePlus fans biggest concern: price creep upwards. $300 becomes $350 becomes $390 becomes.... Goblin Shark Is this article from April 1st? Absolutely no one with any knowledge of phone tech recommended a Pixel, ever! Underspeced and overpriced, I doubt there's any trouble keeping them in stock they just know nobody wants them so they're not making any. Rod Under-spec'ed? Ok Underperforming? Nope Edgar Morales I honestly don't see what the problem is I purchased my pixel XL and have not to date had any issues whatsoever with it no Bluetooth issues no speaker issues nothing everyone is saying Michael Hannigan Hey, if you get a phone you love and it lasts just under a year, that's good enough. What more do you expect for a few hundred bucks. Appreciate the year you loved that thing and then replace it with a new one that you can love even more. Tom Takumi Okamoto OnePlus is a better phone maker than Google. A company not even 1% worth of Google. I really want a Pixel but it's not practical. Ionut Lala I'm sorry but that is clearly not a first generation device. Not the first from Google (made by HTC and let's not forget about the Nexus line). And not the first from HTC (for obvious reasons). Aquan Belk I wish other Android manufacturers went to stock Android. I know Samsung shines in it's own apps on top of Android but vanilla Android still is and always will be the best. Rod You heard the man, people. Don't buy a Pixel because it will have bad resale value and won't be updated for long. Instead, get a model that will have bad resale value and won't be updated for long, plus has worst performance, buggy software and worse camera performance. You're welcome. Stephonz My last Google phone was Nexus 5. As much as I like pure Android experience, Google has a bigheaded trend in phones. The price point was my biggest no no after the 5X. They don't offer as much features as the other well known Android companies.. amir80 I have a Pixel 32 gb and I really really like it. Everything works great and the camera is amazing and also the battey life. For me, the fingerprint sensor is a must. The S8 sensor is poorly located and the G6 sensor is too small. GeorgeDao123 Absolutely. The Pixel duo are 2 pieces of $#!¶. They run pure Android version and they are so slow to boot up and open apps though they are lag-free. Neru Nexus I've had a pixel since launch day. For one I don't agree with the bluetooth issues. Keep the phone up to date or use the bluetooth connect and play app to automate things. Second it is a over priced phone but so is an iPhone. The main reason real users should get a pixel is the updates. Sure you might need to learn something about that expensive piece of tech you bought and not just sit on your hands waiting for the apples or googles of the world to update your shit, but at least google gave us source code, kernel code and a unlocked bootloader. There are still updates being made for the old nexus 5, that's like 5 years old. Grab iphone 4s and tell me again about how fucking great those updates are lol. You can't even install apps like skype or whatsapp that thing is pooched. I can promise the world that even if google stops updating the pixel in 2018 there will be updated versions of the os you can manually install for years. Let's see if you can get more then one firmware update on your fancy new samsung s8. My money is on 1, then the s9 will launch a year later and samsung just won't care about the s8. rjcuk What if you want a slightly smaller phone? The S8 is 5.8" compared to the Pixel at 5". I really struggle to hold 6" phones. Even the Nexus 5X at 5.2" was too big to grip properly and comfortably. Janoo Ramachandran DON'T BUY A PIXEL. We have 2 Pixels at home. One bought early November 16 and the other end Jan 17. The one I was gifted this January, within 40 days had microphone related issues. I could not hear anyone on the phone, nor was the music being played out. They refused a replacement. My phone sat in the repair centre for 8 plus day and the mother board replaced. Have you ever heard of a new phone device of any other brand needing a mother board replacement in leads than 45 days WELL GOOGLE PHONE PIXEL NEEDED IT. The other phone bought early November 16 started having other issues last month and it wasn't recognizing the wifi. After at least 20 hours on the phone with the terrible google support, it had to be sent to the repair centre where it was kept for 2 weeks, you heard that right 16 days to be precise. Then the phone came back with a chip replaced. SHOULD YOI BUY A PIXEL EVER. :. NEVER SHOULD YOU LOOK AT GOOGLE AS A PHONE MAKER :. NEVER Nikhil I wholeheartedly concur here. I picked up a Pixel sometime around December which had to be promptly returned for a replacement as the volume rocker was rickety. The replacement didn't last long either. Within a month, the widely acknowledged microphone issues popped up and after almost 15 days of talking to the very incompetent Google support in India, their only resolution was to take the Pixel to the service center. The service center did not have the motherboard in stock (they had to bring it all the way from Taiwan) and my phone still languishes there even after 15 days of me submitting it. The phone suffers from not only just Gen-one product issues, but also terrible after sales support. Leonardo Baez Agree.... ait for the next generation THEN buy current generation cheaper. Jeremy Allan Actual customer service? You do realize that owners of a pixel get free 24/7 support any time, on a dedicated line for pixel owners? Exalm There is the same section in the settings on Nexus 5X and 6P. No idea whether it works, since there's no chat or phone support in Russia neither for Nexus nor Pixel. Cory Wilson I agree. Granted it was around a year ago I bought my 6p but the 6p didn't cost $870 either. Still don't regret that decision Impulse_Vigil Haven't really had any serious Pixel Bluetooth issues here... A handful of times (literally less than half a dozen) BT shut itself off back in Feb-March, hasn't happened again since the Play Services patch. I use Bluetooth on a daily 24/7 basis too with my ZenWatch 3, car audio, etc. I don't push it to its range limits tho. Dunno whether David's usage and issue is some sorta edge case, or range related, or whether he was speaking to the 1-2 month period when others were having more severe Bluetooth shut off issues. I do agree with the overall sentiment tho, Google hasn't made it easy to buy the Pixel and that's simply inexcusable. I haven't had to suffer thru any of the QC issues (no BT, mic, whatever issues here, knock on wood) but it seems they weren't handled super well either. To be honest I wouldn't even recommend the S8 to anyone either unless it's another geek/enthusiast, these days for most people it's simply not worth it to spend that kind dosh on a phone. I bought my mother a Moto Z Play; I'd probably point others towards that, the OP3, or an HTC One/S7 on sale. I'm super happy with my Pixel, but if there was a OnePlus 3-class device for Zoglog Having owned a pixel XL and now a s8+, I'd have to agree. Even not taking into account the questionable hardware reliability of the pixel (mine died in 5 months). Basically when I owned the pixel I loved the hell out of stock Android but I kept on wondering why I paid so much for it. Meanwhile with the S8+ the gorgeous screen makes it feel especially special and worth the price. Even though I would prefer stock Android 10000% sebastianer Pixel is just another Nexus. Like the 6P. There is no excuse, this is not their first premium phone. Still made by HTC instead of Huawei. And called Pixel instead of Nexus...and more expensive because of HTC and all the marketing costs. And..still has the shitty compass all their recent previous nexus had with a lot of topics open in Google product forums and staff giving tons of manuals about how to perfect calibrate something that doesn't retain calibration. But the main reason I wouldn't buy a Pixel...is the compass and secondly that you will get one more android update if you wait 6 months. username_not_valid How is the pixel the first 'in-house Google phone'? Its clearly and actually a slightly rehashed HTC. HTC doesn't just make it ,they designed it for all intents and purposes. Unless Googles design strategy happens to be exactly like HTCs then its not a Google phone. The Pixel is just an over priced nexus, nothing else. SOUL- Always great to see the smartphone community go from praising a phone to outright basing it just after a couple of months. Perfectly fine with my Pixel. Michael Sørensen It's just ... really boring. andy mckenzie It's a superb phone , blazing fast so processor is not an issue , amazing camera , free storage , online support has been fast and efficient in my experience, stock Android , I'd highly recommend to anyone. remister I am still using my 6P, I couldn't swallow the 1K price tag for 128GB with insurance.... Justin Field Yeah, I broke the screen on my 5x, and since I am on Fi I considered getting a pixel for about 2 seconds and ordered and new screen and fixed my phone. I will wait for the next gen or switch off of Fi.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars BOTS Google published, and then pulled, an I/O action for Google Home Khari Johnson@kharijohnson May 1, 2017 3:29 PM Above: Google Home. Image Credit: Screenshot Google appears to have launched a voice app to talk to you about its annual I/O developer conference, set to take place May 17-19 at the Shoreline Ampitheatre in Mountain View, California. Unfortunately, the conversation action made by Google for its assistant on the Google Home smart speaker didn’t work. Repeated attempts by VentureBeat to speak with the Google I/O 17 action about the I/O keynote speech, the date, and location — questions the action tells you to ask it on Google Home app — were met with silence. Around 2 p.m. PT Monday the action was pulled from the Google Home app and could no longer be called upon when speaking with the Google Assistant on Google Home. Based on news and activity in recent months, a broad range of potential announcements could be made at Google I/O as it relates to the Assistant and the Google Home smart speaker, both of which made their debut at I/O last year. Perhaps Google could release its own smart speaker with computer vision to compete with Alexa’s new Echo Look. Or, instead of going for fashion and computer vision, the next-gen Google Home could go for utility and quality. Last month The Information reported from an undisclosed source that the next generation of Google Home speakers could have mesh network Wi-Fi inside. Mesh networks are used to spread a signal evenly throughout a home. Three Google Wifi routers can cover an area of 4,500 square feet, the company said. Placing the Assistant inside the routers or adding mesh routers won’t just mean more consistent Wi-Fi, but also more Google Assistant availability and more consistent performance by the Assistant throughout a home, or business, or school. A few weeks ago Google said its Assistant is now able to recognize unique voice signatures and Google accounts for up to six people. Should Google announce an increase in the number of unique voice signatures its Assistant is able to identify, applications for the use of the Assistant may increase in settings outside of the home, like in classrooms or among small businesses, startups, or teams at larger companies. There could also be announcements about the recently released Google Assistant software development kit for the spread of Google Assistant to appliances and devices such as home appliances or motorized wheelchairs. While mesh networks and unique voice signatures and computer vision are all exciting and sexy, there are still some basic additions to the Assistant that could be announced at I/O. For example, Google Assistant is still unable to add an event to a calendar, something Alexa does with ease. Google Assistant could also begin to bring third-party actions to devices beyond Google Home. Millions of smartphones running Marshmallow or Nougat, Android TV, Android Wear, and other devices that have or will soon have Google Assistant do not yet have access to the nearly 200 third-party conversation actions that have been made for things like Kayak flight searches, WikiHow DIY tips, in-home elder care, and interactive games. Third-party voice apps or services are currently only available for Google Home.

View all partners Republish this article Republish our articles for free, online or in print, under Creative Commons license. The Australian Tax Office is starting to see the fruits of the pressure flowing from the Senate inquiry into tax avoidance. Lukas Coch/AAP Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger Under pressure from the Australian Tax Office, Google and Facebook have begun to bring their revenue onshore to be taxed. eBay remains recalcitrant, still deeming its Australian business to be a Swiss business and thereby avoiding millions in income tax and GST. It is multinational reporting season once again and the early signs are the government’s multinational tax avoidance laws are starting to work. But the world’s largest corporations are still paying a fraction of their fair share of tax in this country. Until this year, Google and Facebook entertained a corporate structure that booked the billions of dollars of revenue they made in Australia directly offshore. However, eBay is still blithely pretending it doesn’t have an Australian business and that the billion dollars a year it makes from operating its online auction house in this country – through which Australians buy and sell things with other Australians in Australia – is really the business of an entity residing at 15 Helvetiastrasse, Bern, Switzerland. According to its accounts, the latest for the year to December 2016, eBay Australia is still masquerading as being in the business of “the recommendation of market penetration strategies” on behalf of eBay International AG. So it is that every cent of the $59 million that eBay disclosed as its cash-flow statement for 2016 came from related parties, mostly for “rendering of services”. On this, eBay paid $1.9 million in tax after ratcheting up its costs by $13 million to wipe out most of the $20 million uplift in cashflow. The average salary at eBay, if the accounts can be believed, is $312,553 – 109 employees, according to the directors’ report, getting $34.1 million. Mind you, according to the directors’ report, these 109 people are engaged in carrying out the principal activities of the company, which are “the recommendation of market penetration strategies, advertising and promotion activities”. Gobbledygook, but the numbers are irrelevant anyway. The estimated billion dollars or more which eBay is said to make in Australia is not even included in its financial statements, just the revenue from its secretive associates. Moreover the accounts are not consolidated, according to the notes, rendering the entire disclosure a farce. Auditor is PwC. Funnily, though, the cover page Form 388, authenticated by EY, talks about “consolidated revenue” and “consolidated gross assets” – despite the fact that PwC says the accounts are not consolidated. So eBay is the quintessence of the undisclosed agency, a puppet regime designed to whisk Australian profits offshore to a tax haven. The shadow directors are in Bern and the ultimate parent eBay Inc is in the US. Over the past 15 years, eBay has dodged GST and paid income tax of just $8 million (almost one-fifth of its bill for “professional fees” at $38 million), despite its billions of dollars in cash-flow. Positive signs of change Focusing on more positive developments on the multinational tax scene, arch-tax avoider Google Australia and New Zealand is now recognising that a portion of the profits it makes in Australia are in fact Australian rather than Singaporean. Industry observers believe Google makes about $3 billion in sales from its advertising business here. Until this year, its only revenue has come from three related parties via service arrangements. Now, with the introduction of the multinational anti-avoidance legislation, Google has recognised roughly one-third of its Australian revenue as Australian. In the broader context it is worth considering the effect of the digital revolution on Australia’s tax base. Where the TV networks, News Ltd (though belligerent on the tax front) and Fairfax Media once paid hundreds of millions of dollars a year in tax collectively, they are now struggling to make a profit. In their place, it is estimated Facebook and Google now pick up 80% of the advertising dollar in this country but they pay negligible tax. Globalisation and the internet are similarly challenging Australia’s revenue base in retail, financial services and other sectors. Paypal, for instance, eBay’s corporate cousin, paid more than $1 billion of its $1.2 billion in revenues to its parent and associates in Singapore over the nine years to 2014 thanks to a “service agreement”. Looking at the accounts, thanks to the new tax law, revenue rose from $498 million to $1.14 billion. Sales and marketing expenses, however, recognised for the first time at $324 million, knocked profits about. Profit rose from $50 million to $121 million on which tax expense was $16 million, up from $3 million. Actual tax paid as per the cash-flow statement was $41 million, up from $16 million. So, like Apple, Google is beginning to pay significant amounts of tax, although still way short of the mark, and it appears to have bloated its cost base here as much as humanly possible. Assuming group sales are heading towards $3 billion (Google booked $882 million in advertising revenue), the real income tax number ought to have nine digits. For its part, Facebook booked revenue of $327 million, ten times the $33.5 million recorded in the the previous year. After forking out $271 million to related parties for the “purchase of advertising inventory”, it made a profit of just $6.3 million on which it paid $3.4 million in tax. Under its previous structure, Facebook sales were booked to an associate in Ireland. For the purposes of reporting as little as possible, the company even won an exemption from the corporate regulator when it claimed to be a “Small Pty Company Controlled By a Foreign Coy Which is Not Part of Large Group”. That its foreign parent was valued at more than $170 billion on Wall Street didn’t seem to matter. Now, Facebook has declared itself to be a reseller of local advertising inventory. Both Google and Facebook are audited by EY. None of these companies operate to maximise profits for the benefit of their Australian entities. All have small, token boards of directors. All operate in the interests of their foreign overlords and should be taxed as agencies. It is a good thing the authorities are catching up with multinational tax lurks. This would not have occurred without public outrage and dissent. Nor would it have occurred without the Senate Inquiry into Corporate Tax Avoidance in 2015, which thrust the issues into public view. They should keep this Senate committee rolling with biannual investigations where corporate leaders are held to account and subject to full public scrutiny. After all, directors have a fiduciary duty to perform in the interests of their companies, not some tax officer in California. Further, the architects of multinational tax avoidance – EY, Deloitte, PwC and KPMG – ought to be subject to greater disclosure requirements rather than operating as murky partnerships whose partners pontificate to government on tax policy while advising their big clients how best not to pay tax, or “leakage” as they call it in the trade.

Opinion: Even if you can, you probably shouldn't buy a Google Pixel anymore David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/05/01 2:09pm PDTMay 1, 2017 66 Plus 1 on G+ 263 Share on Facebook 60 Share on Twitter Total Shares389 Editorials Pixel Pixel XL The Google Pixel is a notoriously hard phone to get a hold of. Persistent stock issues have plagued Google's first "in-house" handset from day one, and things really are little to no better six months after the launch event. Honestly, it's a bit embarrassing just how consistently incompetent Google seems to be at keeping a reasonable inventory of phones available for purchase. But setting that aside, as one of the Pixel's most ardent evangelists, I think there's something it's probably time for me to come clean on: Even if you could buy a Pixel today, I really think you shouldn't. The Pixel is a product with generation-one product issues. The Bluetooth performance is horrid. It's not waterproof. The bezels really are due for a shrink. I don't think the exterior coating on the black and blue variants is of a particularly high quality. The glass window gets scuffed up incredibly easily. The Snapdragon 821 is officially old news. And it doesn't support proper advanced network features across all four of the big US carriers. There are other flaws I could point to, and while none of them are too terrible, they do speak to the slightly-rushed development cycle this phone seems to have been subjected to. Sure, Google got some things astoundingly right: the performance, the camera, the larger software experience. In fact, I think the Pixel is easily the best Android smartphone ever for these strengths, at least if we're talking about me personally as a user (your mileage, obviously, may vary). But for all the great, smooth, fast, clean, pure, simple, natural, and various other adjective-members singing in the Pixel-praise cavalcade, this phone is not the one to buy right now. For starters, Google continues to ask what is an increasingly laughable amount of money for the model most of us want - the 128GB XL - at a staggering $870. Sure, Apple charges the same for an iPhone 7 Plus 128GB, but I'm under no illusion that this comparison in any way favors Google. The iPhone comes with Apple customer service (with actual stores), a longer software support period going forward, and runs no real risk of poor resale value. The Pixel? Google's online support is iffy at best, we know the phone will be unsupported by October 2018, and I have a strong feeling generation-one Pixel resale values will drop like a rock once the new phones are announced. And that really is why, if you haven't pulled the trigger on a Pixel yet, you should just wait. It's overpriced, under-supported, and competing phones like the Galaxy S8 offer a whole lot more technology for your money. The Galaxy S8+ is $20 less than a 128GB Pixel XL, and I would argue it is far and away the better smartphone value. That amazing display, brand-new Snapdragon 835 processor, jaw-dropping design and packaging, and the full support of all our American carriers' latest LTE advancements could each be a reason on its own to put the Galaxy S8 above Google's smartphone. Do I still prefer using the Pixel over the S8? Sure. But I wouldn't buy a 128GB Pixel XL over a Galaxy S8+ today. That would be, frankly, a bit silly. If Google was asking $670 and not $870, the discussion would probably change, but they aren't. You've got to pay full price, and there's no way I could recommend anyone do that. If you're still on the fence about the Pixel, let me try to push you over: wait for the next generation. I realize that this sort of thinking can devolve into a rationale that encourages you to never upgrade anything because something newer, faster, and better is constantly on the horizon. But in this case, I think it's a consideration that is worth weighing more seriously than usual. Many of the Pixel's biggest flaws relate to Google's inexperience producing a smartphone. Issues that only come up as you try to mass-produce and distribute a product with a real marketing campaign that creates real demand, and the phone gets into the hands of "real" users who aren't part of the now-derailed Nexus phone hypetrain. Inside Google, expectations were no doubt managed, realities realized, and priorities accordingly re-calibrated after this first launch. (Side note: if the Bluetooth performance on the next Pixel is as bad as the first one, I may scream, Google.) Meanwhile, the things that make the Pixel great aren't going anywhere. The next Pixel will be fast, it will take great photos, and it will offer a wonderfully unfettered Android experience. Those that make it less than great? Google is no doubt drilling down through the worst of them in order to ensure the Pixel 2 - or whatever it's called - won't make the same mistakes that the original did (waterproofing, please). And one of the primary reasons to try the Pixel in the first place - to be on the very bleeding edge - really only remains true from a software standpoint. Older phones like the Nexus 5X and 6P don't even let the Pixel have an advantage there, as they're on the same update track until around the time the next Pixel phones launch. If you absolutely need a smartphone soon and the Pixel is tempting you, ask yourself this: Can you deal with a Moto G5 Plus for six months if it means having a better Pixel down the road? While as a reviewer I have the admitted luxury of not needing to consider such things, were I in such a position, I'd have little in the way of a counterargument to offer. Sure, you'll take a resale hit on anything you buy now, but the Pixel is going to face a much, much steeper devaluation curve in that time than any budget phone. Buying a Pixel right now just doesn't make sense. I love my Pixel XL, but I'm officially done recommending the phone to friends and relatives. Instead, I'll tell them to wait, or to get the Galaxy S8 they were probably going to buy anyway. Tags editorial google pixel google pixel xl opinion pixel xl subscribe ...

Google really shot themselves in the foot with availability. My name is…. No, they shot their foot with huge bezels, with lack of waterproof, lack of dual speakers, no real camera progress compared to nexii, meh battery life, meh screen. No real selling point besides being pure android phone. This phone had iphone price but was worst on so many levels (no A10 SoC, no iphone-fast NAND, no 4yrs updates) Oneplus on the other hand........ M. Luciano Also has none of that stuff, but is cheaper? My name is…. yes, half price cheaper. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ The black screen issue kind of negates anything else ;) Michael Hannigan What's the "black screen issue"? Carson Saldanha YOU WANT THE PIXEL TO HAVE THE A10 CHIP?? BHAAAAAAAHAHAHA My name is…. No, i want it to have a cheaper price, or be better somehwere else, like the Galaxy. STOP BEING RUDE Carson Saldanha https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CYF7C6hVAAAKF-_.jpg Tr3ple Shut up troll ,nobody likes you I see lmao My name is…. You know when you see the dumb guy, he always adds 'lol' or 'lmao' at the end of his sentence. And his syntax is always wrong. STFU and GTFO Liam Bulkley "You know when you see the dumb guy... And his syntax is always wrong." "You are an [sic] ignorant" Don't cut yourself on the glass. Michael Hannigan They have that - The Nexus 5x. Тарас Мукин You keep hating Pixel in the comments, but you only look at numbers. But they doesn't matter when it comes to Google. Software experience does. My name is…. That's a stupid argument Тарас Мукин And saying that somebody's argument is stupid without any explanation is a much smarter argument. My name is…. Would you pay 900$ bucks for Nexus 5 just because "Software experience matters"?? Carson Saldanha Nobody said they were paying just for the "software experience" Matt Tapac said that specs don't matter, the software experience does. That heavily implies that people are paying for the software experience. Carson Saldanha xD here we go again drunken_bastard Pixel and Pixel XL have better cameras and screens than any iPhone. The difference in SoC and other bits of hardware, they don't translate into any real world speed differences. Pixel also has great battery life. Perhaps some hands on time may do you some good. supersanborn Given that they continually sell out of the limited stock they have, none of what you cited matters. If they had a ginormous supply of units and THEN couldn't sell, then perhaps you would be on to something. My name is…. What was the availability in the first place? You think they produced many? No way Jose, i bet Galaxies and iphones outsold pixels by multiple times supersanborn We don't exactly know what they had hoped to produce or even what they actually produced, so your point remains conjecture. And who here is suggesting that Samsung and Apple phones didn't outsell the Pixel? My name is…. * by multiple times James Betti Sadly, Google isn't keeping the Pixel in stock because they don't care about their hardware line. Google makes most of its money through ads and personal data. It's a shame, but it explains why they discontinue successful products and barely have much in stock. Excellent phone by the way. Michael Hannigan Well, that's easy to rectify. Do like Amazon and offer the same exact hardware with "special offers" for a lower price. Then you get to see ads everywhere, even your home screen and app drawer. Pretty cool. Michael Hannigan Yes, they did. It was in the millions. Max "no real camera progress compared to nexii, meh battery life, meh screen." Ok, so you don't have a Pixel, we get it. My name is…. I'm not dumb, do you get that too? Xchris I think the consensus here is that you are talking bollocks. The pixel XL has an unbelievably good screen, one of the best battery life figures, still has the best camera out of any smartphone. Nobody who bought the pixel cares that much about any of your other points. In fact, what you are really saying is that you didn't like the pixel. Big deal! My name is…. Actually, i'm fighting the pixel in a nerdy community. Its expected that the consensus is that "i am talking bollocks". People here mainly wanna root their phones and put center clocks on status bar. they did the same with Nexii devices, its all about the software, but those phones were seriosly lacking (i used to own all Nexus devices after 4) Carson Saldanha So may I ask, what phone do you use now? My name is…. 1+3 Carson Saldanha Srsly!?!? Bruh, the OnePlus 3 has a Snapdragon 820 while the Pixel has a 821, a far better camera, better performance, and software. How is the OP3 better than the Pixel? Besides the price? I could probably understand if you had the OP3T, but no way. My name is…. You are an ignorant. 1) Check the speedtests, 1+3 is faster (because better nand) 2) Software is better on 1+3 (aosp with tiny mods) 3) Pixel has underclocked 821, thus 820 with a little bit of better battery life (1+3 has 1080p screen to tie this up) 4) 1+3 has 6gb ram (will be good for 4 years) 5) 1+3 is smaller than pixels, unbelievably thin 6) 1+3 has dash charging (world leading) 7) 1+3 has half the price 8) 1+3T is another story, far better Apply cream to the burn, son PS Yes Pixel has a better camera. Carson Saldanha Ignorance at it's finest. My name is…. Those are all FACTS, son. My name is…. Where are you, son? Jack Smith Have you ever even used a Pixel? Only Android phone i have used with zero touch lag. Can we also stop the name calling? Mason Andrew Maseda Hate to break it to you man. I own The One Plus 3T the Google Pixel the Nexus 6P and the Moto X pure edition. Lol. Guess witch one is my daily driver? The Pixel. Why? Better battery . Better cam. All around the most reliable phone. Even with my Nexus 6P I've had some issues here and there tiny ones. Like some days my battery life was abnormally shit and the next day it was great. The one plus 3T has tiny issues too. The Pixel is a phone that you wouldn't understand UNLESS YOU TRY ONE FOR A DAY. come back when you do. tansuperman Not sure why people think the pixel takes good pics. I have a pixel xl, 950xl, IPhone 7plus, and now the s8. In my opinion the pixel xl takes the worst pics. The lumia 950xl is stop dog. The pixel I can tell is just too overprocessed Michael Hannigan I think it applies mostly to low light pictures - absolutely nothing touches the Pixel in that respect - trust me. More generally, it applies to the software and hardware working together to create stunning (real) HDR pictures. But in low.light, which according to a friend of mine who is a smartphone camera freak (I am not), quality of low light pictures are what users are primarily interested in because he says "...any recent smartphone can take great pictures in daylight.". For me, I liked the flexibility of the V20 camera - not just the dual lenses, but the absolutely fantastic functions in the camera app. D13H4RD2L1V3 Um, the 821 consumes less power than the 820 at the lower clocks due to a more efficient binning process. Also, both the Pixel and OP3 use UFS 2 controllers. But on Nougat, the 3 uses F2FS for its filesystem. It's not a case of better NAND. It's a case of different filesystems. Michael Hannigan I think they should use FAT16. I miss it. Chris Rey I will say the Axon 7 is just as good as the OnePlus 3 and looks better. Suicide_Note The Pixel camera is definitely superior to what was in the 6P, and i say that as someone who currently owns them both. M. Luciano I use both on a daily basis. Agree with you 100%. So do objective measurements of the cameras. Pixel is the best on the market; 6P is decent but not great. andy_o On paper both cameras should be just short of identical, but the Pixel is so much faster in processing cause of the HVX dedicated core, plus the N6P throttles like crazy (in one of my photospheres tests in a warm room the Nexus 6 beat it every time). This is crucial especially with Google who is prioritizing computational photography probably on par or more with hardware camera specs. Also, I'm not sure if this is a hardware or artificial limitation, but HDR+ auto has completely different behavior on the Pixels. I can understand how someone who has only looked at the specs and not used a Pixel and N6P (especially in the summertime), can think that there's been "no real camera progress", but this guy is balls-deep in the "arrogance of ignorance". Michael Hannigan I think the reason for the difference in HDR+ in the Pixel is that it's" real HDR - it takes several pictures and then layers them. Other phones have taken a shortcut do doing that with one picture and it really doesn't achieve the same. Except in one case - manually setting HDR in my Note 7 gave absolutely stunning night time photos. Something I can't quite achieve with the built in software on the Pixel (but can with Photoshop). andy_o I was talking the difference between HDR+ auto in the Pixel and HDR+ auto in the previous phones. The auto behavior in the Pixel is different, but the HDR+ processing is basically the same. There's more info here: http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/11/21/deep-dive-closer-look-google-pixels-camera/#What_does_HDR_do If you feel nerdy enough I can link you to a paper on HDR+ by the Google computational photography team too :) Regarding the other phone cameras, the reason they do worse isn't exactly that they they're taking shortcuts, it's actually because they're doing it the traditional way, taking different exposures. Read the AP article linked above for details on how HDR+ is fundamentally different. Michael Hannigan You have OLED burn-in? I have about 8 hours SOT/day and don't have any. That would piss me off. Jason B Inverting colors for a bit while doing some extended reading helps. Black background with white text is easier on the eyes too. But yeah, static nav bar and notification area aren't great for OLED. There should be auto pixel shift to prevent it ... or Google should make more use of Immersive Mode. whispy_snippet Ugh. Like a broken fucking record here sometimes. Shawn Spring While some of your other points may/may not be valid, to say that the Pixel had "no real camera progress compared to nexii" just makes you sound ignorant. The S821 ISP alone would make the camera in the Pixel superior, not to mention the updated HDR algorithms. Get a Pixel owner and a 6P owner in the same room (I was both) and ask them to shoot with each others phone and see who prefers which. The 6P camera lag in HDR mode was inefficient at best and unbearable at worst. And it wasn't that long ago that OnePlus was using a broken invite system, had people lick their phones, and had a horribly gender insensitive marketing campaign. I'd probably not hold them up as the standard bearer against Google. Michael Hannigan They had people lick their phones? Why did they never ask me to do that? That's discrimination. I should have been asked to lick my phone. Brett Lewis I love my pixel after coming from a HTC 8x on Windows platform. Never liked Apple and never will. And lately after all the talk of Samsung's products (blowing up, red screens, other problems) I'm quite happy with my pixel. I don't need water proofing I'm not an idiot that takes my phone near water.. the I hardly notice the bezels after coming from a 4.3 inch 720 display.. The htc8x had one of the widest angle front cameras but I dont take selfies. This pixel does what I want and is fast doing it. And for first time experiencing Android I'm quite happy with buying this with the newest and best version available. TheHater So only idiots take their phones near water? I bet if you had a water resistant phone, you'd take it near water. Michael Hannigan What about the toilet? Who doesn't read the news when sitting on the shitter? Mariano Moreira I would definitely agree in terms of the Pixel XL vs iPhone 7 plus comparisons (Non-32GB model) Comparing the base iPhone 7 vs base Pixel...the iPhone 7 base had(has) slow Nand performance from what I have witnessed. The 32GB iPhone 7 vs base 32GB Pixel (5") seems like a closer comparison where the compromise is better battery life on the Pixel, faster Nand, and better screen. Again, I concur that looking at the Pixel XL vs iPhone 7 Plus leans more heavily towards Apple especially when comparing the 128GB models. Michael Hannigan If you buy from the Google store, they are carrier agnostic - absolutely 0 carrier bloatware. Mariano Moreira No. I have a Google Play(Bootloader unlocked) purchased Pixel. Normally used on Sprint or At&t. When I activate on Verizon: to get Vo-LTE calling with Verizon SIM and certain carrier settings it does a software update switching the phone over to the Verizon specific software build. If it was truly Carrier-agnostic it wouldn't force a Carrier specific Software build onto my non-Verizon model Pixel. Michael Hannigan You must have either bought it from Verizon or screwed something up. An unlocked phone doesn't suddenly become carrier specific like you describe Mike John Quincy Adams I don't one person who owns or says ’I sure wish I had a OnePlus.' Michael Hannigan I have - when I had the OnePlus One. Many people asked me about it. You can't deny that OnePlus phones offer an unbeatable value. They don't skimp on specs and sell for half the.price they should. asrat_24 I get you're trying to make fun of that guy but don't make ignorant statements while trying to do it. Oneplus makes good phones and people are interested enough nowadays to say that. Major Sceptic Agree on all points , a mid range device with a flagship price , perhaps Google will adjust the prices on the 2 ? for a company trying to expand it's phone sales it's going a funny way about it . Artem Russakovskii Well, usually at that point you start seeing significant discounts, but the Pixel is a misnomer in that regard to due to low stock and high demand. Max Exactly, I would revise that affirmation to state: "I've always felt once we are less than 6 months from the new iteration, it's a mistake to buy the existing product *at full price*." supersanborn I'll grant there's a case to be made for some phones where waiting can result in substantial discounts (especially from HTC/LG/etc). Probably a little of my bias sneaks in here. I prefer to have the newer device, and if I waited 6 months post-launch, it probably means I myself need to wait until the next launch. Max I'm with you there, I usually buy a phone at launch or a couple of months later at most but remember that we aren't regular customers, that's why we read and comment on this site ;). For many people out there it makes more sense to buy a phone six months after release if it comes with a nice worthy discount. M. Luciano This ^^ supersanborn Agreed, for some, shaving $100-200 off the price is all that matters. I usually caution folk pretty hard in the last 3 months before the new iteration drops if they have any form of new feature/size/color envy. supersanborn And yeah, I'm nowhere near the "normal" consumer :-) needa Supposed to be picking up a 32gb XL (Google) for $450 near mint in a couple hours. I might not get it, but a killer deal nonetheless. M. Luciano Smash that deal :) Very nice. needa A few little scratches on the back glass. Profit.

The lowest I've seen on Swappa was $695 for a black XL. supersanborn True. I usually find that the discounts are kind of on the "meh" side though until we hit release of new product. I always basically tell folks that you either buy it at launch until about 6ish months post-launch, and if you've held off that long, you should just wait until next launch and either buy the old product at a big discount or buy the new one. Matt I believe your use of misnomer was a bit of a misnomer. Artem Russakovskii I did use the wrong word, you're right. el_smurfo That's why I just picked up a 6p last year for $400. Most expensive smartphone I've ever bought, but the full release price was just not in my budget. Karly Johnston Battery issues? MisterAlex Maybe an anomaly... but not a misnomer. paxmos Where is this high demand you guys talk about?, I have yet to see a pixel in anyone's hand M. Luciano Really? I know over a dozen people who have or had them. paxmos Yep...I see lots of iPhones and Sammy's, even one Blackberry Z30, have only seen a pixel in the Verizon store. M. Luciano I feel like a nerd owning 4 Major Sceptic It does seem to have more of an enthusiast following , no shortage of pixels in my region , the usual brands , apple, Samsung, still seem to have the sales , I know not one person that has a pixel or wants one , and I think Google only has itself to blame on that front, Re : the cost of a pixels . Goblin Shark Finally, someone who knows what they're taking about - my head is just shaking in disbelief reading what these marshmallow brains that think they know about phones are saying on this comment thread lol Daishi Exactly. I have yet to see a Pixel in the wild. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ To be fair, HTC isn't used to such a high demand for their phones. Google unfortunately paid the price Daishi This made me LOL! A post full of WIN for sure!! Zoglog Actually it's probably because of all the RMA's they've gotten JD Thought that was obvious. syxbit I wonder whether we shouldn't wait for Pixel + 2. The next Pixel may technically be the first Google made product (current Pixel is made by HTC), so it's possible the Pixel 2 will have first gen problems. Still, I still have the N6P (after I scoffed at the Pixel price and refused to buy it), so I going to be looking for a phone soon. Good_Ole_Pinocchio HTC is also manufacturing the Pixel 2. Word on the street. Daishi That's too bad. I'll avoid this this phone as well... Captain On! Well, technically the iPhone is made by Foxconn, so... Don't expect Google to actually build their own facilities to produce hardware. Carson Saldanha Pretty sure they'll still be using HTC. Might have more control over the design this time around though. 4Ui812 The availability issue is a play out Nintendo's handbook. Good_Ole_Pinocchio 100% agree with the entire article... Do I want the Pixel Software Experience and Camera? Yes... But not when the new version is a few months away thag would probably fix all the issues I see posted on this site ever so often...starting with the Bluetooth issues. I got an S8... Because it's the only phone thay makes sense to me right now..... I'll see what Google is doing in the fall Max Johnson If the Moto G5 Plus had NFC I would have no problem making it my Android daily driver for the next 6 months. wade_county Moto Z Play and OP3/OP3T are other options with NFC. shadowx360 I used to buy 1 generation old Nexus devices to get around the cost issue, but it seems the 5X and 6P both are plagued by serious phone-killing issues. Now that warranty is up on nearly every used 5X/6P, buying used is like trying to navigate a minefield. I don't really trust 1st generation Pixel to not have serious issues either. I'd never use a non-Pixel/Nexus device but I can't buy a Pixel XL knowing Samsung offers so much better hardware at a similar price. wade_county My advice is getting the next OnePlus phone or picking up a used OP3/OP3T. AndrewGM I bought a used Pixel in good shape on eBay, as I couldn't get one from Google Store (already had a wireless provider). Switched from an iPhone 6s, after using almost every iPhone model since and including the original. Much better camera on the Pixel, especially closeups and in low light, and much easier to use overall (especially Contacts vs. iOS), as I've used mostly Google apps for a long time. I like the Google keyboard much better and the Android interface. I'm definitely satisfied with the Pixel and have no real iPhone regrets. It's true there are more apps for the iPhone, but that doesn't matter because the core apps are available on Android too. The only app I miss is Enlight, for photo editing. The one Pixel issue I agree with is the relatively poor resale value vs. iPhones (I assume). Carson Saldanha May I suggest Snapseed for photo editing? (It's developed by Google) Also, do you miss iMessage/FaceTime or is that really a con? AndrewGM Will check out Snapseed, thanks. I've been using Google Photos to lightly edit pics. The Pixel camera is so good that I often don't edit (for Instagram/FB uploads), especially if the light and composition are already good. I don't miss iMessage at all. I had to turn it off and all that stuff for my phone number when I switched, but I'm texting away every day. Emoticons seem to work fine. I don't even think about iMessage. FaceTime has been replaced with Duo for my family members, including those on iPhone. Seems to work fine. And I can share location with family members via Google Maps. I guess that brings up privacy issues vs. using Apple products, but not sure it makes a real-world difference. Battery life, btw, seems pretty good (I charge the phone overnight only). The call quality is a little less than iPhone, maybe, but overall acceptable. AndrewGM Will add that I have had the Pixel for 2 months and use it daily. I like the screen on the Pixel (or at least it never bothers me), and the issue about the "chin" at the bottom being big is a non-issue to me. I don't notice it and in fact hold the phone sometimes there, which is arguably convenient. If the phone continues to hold up, I'll be a customer for Pixel 2 eventually. Eric I was ready to jump to the Pixel XL after returning my second Note 7, but Google never gave me the opportunity to give them my money. Carson Saldanha xD My name is…. It was never a good device. thank you for finally admitting that. Andrew I don't think that's what the author is saying... My name is…. Someone had to be crazy to buy a pixel in the first place. I was bashing on that device from day one. Author, months later, says that the phone is no good. It was never good. Carson Saldanha Lord, would you just chill? Tr3ple I think he's retarded, gotta be it, lol. Must be it actually. Carson Saldanha troll by far Suicide_Note Except that's not at all what the author said, so you're either: A) trolling, B) incredibly dumb, or C) both of the above. Тарас Мукин Of course there's no point in buying Pixel for full price now. And there's more: there's no point in buying any device for it's starting price when it's 3 months old — tech gets old really fast today. And that's the whole point of not buying something at day one — everything gets much cheaper very fast. Samsungs do, LGs too. But Pixel for some reason didn't. And Nexuses were like this too. So — only buying Google devices right after release makes sense. Or buying them unofficially and cheaper. Sad, but true. sraj49 I always like and respect your articles. You put your views straight forward. But I tend not to agree with the tone and content of this article completely. I am living in Home of full Apple products and I own a Pixel XL. I love the Pixel in all aspects. Yes there are room to improvements which is true for everyone. Apple products are well designed, well built. As regards sorry gone are those days when Apple sorry was at is best which was until iPhone 4s/ iPhone 5. Now after the warmth period it is the same as Pixel. I going Pixel after sales support very good. I definitely agree with you on the most inefficient handling of supplies and also this is not the time to buy since meet models are coming. Just to add, I get sick when people say that the Pixel phones are not made by Google but by HTC. Everyone outsources manufacturing. Most of the phone are made by Foxcon staying from Apple. All phone manufacturers only design the hardware, software and the manufacturing is outsourced. Good_Ole_Pinocchio The HTC point that keeps coming up comes from the fact that Google didn't really dsign much hardware hete. They just used HTC parts. It's not the same as hardware being designed by apple then manufactureres elsewhere. andy_o I think he's right on that point. Google support may or may not be good, but it's online only. Apple support is famously good. For instance, the recent fixes for iPhone 6s battery problems. I booked an appointment, went into the store, they told me it would be a bit, went to a coffee shop, they emailed me, picked it up. Another time my iPad mini 2 mute switch broke. Again, appointment, go in the store, got it actually just exchanged on the spot. Google simply cannot do that. JohnyNoLegs What android phones have you owned prior to the pixel? And yes it's a HTC phone through and through. Scofabear Shots fired! I even dumped my 6P for a Moto z play. No regrets Futbolrunner Same here! That 808 was a lag fest. I even got the S8+ but returning it because it can't touch the Play's battery life. Dominic D I just bought a Pixel a month ago. I still would recommend it if you get one for fairly cheaply on swappa. It's awesome. Brian Demodulated My last 3 phones have been Nexus. Each has been less reliable than the last. I love how hackable they are but I think my next phone will be a Samsung Galaxy. Carson Saldanha Elaborate? Wdym by "less reliable" What issues? Brian Demodulated My Samsung Galaxy Nexus was incredible and still works today. My Nexus 5 was garbage - two broke within 1.5 years. My 6P is quirky - it doesn't charge on my home PC and although my wife's updated to 7.1.2 mine says it's up to date at 7.1.1. Tr3ple Get a pixel then, Samsung lol. Brian Demodulated I have my 6P another year. I'll see what's available next year when my contract is up. JohnyNoLegs Bootloops, dodgy updates, requires factory resets, breaks features, slow bug fixes. M. Luciano No offense, but you are not going to increase stability by going to Samsung. Brian Demodulated My old Samsung Galaxy Nexus was the best, highest quality, most reliable phone I ever owned. LG and Huawei's Nexus phones were less stable for me. M. Luciano I had a few of those.. they weren't as reliable. But probably because I did bad things to them. Brian Demodulated I rooted mine, loaded hacky ROMs, and carried it with me everywhere I went for 3 years. The USB and audio cables are a little loose now but otherwise it's saved me when my later Nexus phones crapped out on me. Vitali Galaxy nexus had clean stock rom, it is just Google's clean soft in a Samsung physical device and not with samsung's os Brian Demodulated Every Nexus has the clean stock ROM. It's one of the top reasons why I get them. JohnyNoLegs Going Pixel sure doesn't increase stability. It's less stable than my Note 4/Note 7. Vitali Agree with M. Luciano, but people try should move to Sony. Lookup at speed test videos of their Xperia XZs, it has beaten all smartphones by now, including the Pixel. All the biased big reviewers out there will never tell you the truth, stop thinking the S8 is the best phone in the world.. I recommend you to wait for their Xperia XZ Premium it will have sd835! After you see the XZs speed, I promise you it may be the fastest phone even in 2018. Suicide_Note No. Just...no. Vitali *A wild 8 year old fanboy comment appears* Brian Demodulated Speed isn't that important to me. I've heard bad things about Sony's flavour of Android and that it's bloaty. Vitali So you heard wrong, their software is one of the bests out there, and im talking from experience.. And Samsung have so clean and fast Android that it is just unbelievable.. Where do you get all that info from?? Vitali So you heard wrong, their software is one of the bests out there, and im talking from experience.. And Samsung have so clean and fast Android that it is just unbelievable.. "I've heard.." Where do you get all that info from?? Suicide_Note TW is much better than it used to be, but it's hardly clean and fast. Brian Demodulated I work in a large IT department. One of my buddies told me about it. He said Sony's Android UI was all over the place and annoying to use, and that his handset was 2 major versions behind the latest version of Android OS. dtox Lol don't listen to him, xperia phones are absolute trash. dtox LOL xperia = garbage D13H4RD2L1V3 Um, I'm not entirely sure. Not that I'm ragging Sony, but they haven't exactly been selling for a reason. Even Sony themselves know. I don't hate Sony phones. I personally think they're understated, solid offerings. Problem was that they were really overpriced. After seeing the XZs and XA1, seems like their pricing may have become more logical. We'll see how it goes. I'm personally hoping the XZP may even be a solid device. Not that I'll buy one but if the price is right, it'll be significantly easier to recommend. JSo Experiences differ from person to person. But It's odd the luck you have had with the Nexus devices. I've had the Galaxy Nexus, Nexus 5 and now the Nexus 5X and I have never had an issue with any of them. JohnyNoLegs No battery issues with 5X? My wifes upgraded to 7.1.1 and has never been the same, bluetooth is slow and laggy, and the battery barely gets 1.5-2 hours SOT after it used to get close to 3. Michael Hannigan Dude, you're talking about a crusty old obsolete phone. And unless you are happy getting 2 hours of battery time, you should pry the wallet open and buy something current. Complaining about your old phone won't make you feel better. Replacing it with a working, current phone that's not past it's expected useful life will. JohnyNoLegs Dude, wth are you talking about. It's a 1.5 years old. From new it was getting 4-5, right up until 7.1.1 update. Roy My 6P is the most reliable phone ever. And I had Samsung and HTC. Duder12 The last Nexus phones had bum processors from qc. royrov My Nexus 6P kissed the asphalt a couple of weeks ago, so I bought a perfect Pixel XL second hand (used 3-4 months). Its better, no regrets here. Faster and better battery, hell even snapchat is snappy on it! Tr3ple Exaclty lol, people saying the pixel isn't an upgrade to the 6p are delusional lol. They all like to hate on it u til they get one and realize how good of a phone it is. And all the bugs I've been seeing on the net are nowhere to be found and I had mine for 5-6 months now bekifft I know it's an upgrade. It's just not much of an upgrade for an enormous amount of money. Tr3ple My 6p had serious issues, I went and got a s7 egde(big mistake), the price I paid was well worth it. I'm still financing my s7 egde while I'm using a pixel, this is how much I love this phone. destinyhud I will still buy one Michael Tran If I could give you a phone for free but you had to keep it and use it and couldn't sell it. Which phone would it be? M. Luciano 128 GB Pixel XL, black supersanborn My 128GB Pixel XL in black. At least until the 2 comes and **hopefully** adds waterproofing, 600Mhz support, 4x4MIMO for T-Mobile. If you're reading, Pixel team, let's talk! Orlando aka Pixel XL Samsung Galaxy S8+ blue Tr3ple Gimme a 128 gb pixel XL black any day keithzg The bezels really are due for a shrink. Boy are you gonna rue this when the second-gen comes out and the bezels are the exact same ;) M. Luciano I sorta hope they are :) keithzg You animal! (But honestly, this is why choice is good. I find the desire for those top and bottom bezels incomprehensible, but I can entirely understand that not everyone would feel the way I do, particularly if routinely holding phones very differently.) M. Luciano I just want SOME bezels. They don't need to be huge. Just want a place to put my thumbs when holding it sideways. It's a good place for speakers IMO. Carson Saldanha Nah, to be fair, I think Google's definitely not planning on keeping them the same size if they've listened to the reviews. keithzg I mean, if they'd listened to reviews of many other phones before they put out the Pixels they would have known that too---including, for instance, the previous two generations of Nexus phones . . . So it seems likely that either (a) they know of the opinions of the commentariat and disagree, or (b) they felt technically they couldn't do it. I'm personally hoping it was somehow just (b) but they used (a) to convince themselves that it was an okay sacrifice, but that they won't have to make the same sacrifice again this year and they'll allow themselves to change up the design. But I'm not gonna bet too much money on that. Carson Saldanha Whoa, you lost be there with all those "a's" and "b's" xD Shawn Spring I think its pretty well known at this point that the time frame between when Google's negotiations w/Huawei fell through and when they picked the deal up with HTC was the cause of the "let's use the leftover A9 shells" bezel issue. So more (b) than (a) assuredly. ikeofkc If they do. Peoples' thumb muscles are going to be screwed if they use the pixel 1 handed, constantly trying to reach the back button. The chin makes one handed use possible keithzg See, that's what I mean about different folks and different strokes. I've never noticed it being of any help with my Nexus 6P, for me the top and bottom bezels are completely useless. bekifft If they actually put something useful there, like a front facing stereo speaker, I would be totally fine with that. keithzg Dammit, don't you go making me miss the Nexus 6 again! Michael Hannigan I want them to be bigger. I want to be able to lean on mine when I am standing in line at a movie. MadMartigan I am constantly amazed by the short memories. The author thinks it likely they are likely to have a better launch of P2? They do give the obvious impression that they believe the Pixel to be their first swing and a miss... Funny how quickly we forget, well, nearly every other device Google has ever tried to sell. I personally loved my 4, 10, 5, 6, and 6. But I cannot, while keeping a straight face, argue that one should expect anything better from them regarding inventory management this time around. How many times does Google have to fail on inventory management before we start pointing and laughing at the people who constantly say, "They'll get it right this time, for sure." Don't get me wrong - I would absolutely love it if Google proved me wrong on the P2. I just won't believe it until I see it. //dons flameproof suit// A'ight, I'm ready. Fire away... M. Luciano This is their first swing and a miss, but only because the shortages are for very different reasons than prior devices they sold on behalf of other OEM's. MadMartigan Who...who do you think made the Pixels? M. Luciano Google is the OEM for the Pixel phones (and tablets, and laptops, etc). HTC is the factory putting the phones together. It's a totally different legal and business agreement, and essentially means that Google has to supply most of the components, contracts, contacts, etc. and HTC is essentially an assembly line. On Nexus phones, the OEM was Samsung, or LG or Huawei, etc. and they actually designed and produced the phones, in partnership with and input from Google. Completely different. For those, the partner was able to do all the contracting and sourcing; HTC isn't doing all the work for Google this time. MadMartigan So you don't believe HTC designed the Pixel. Got it. That's all I needed to see. M. Luciano Not sure what that means, but ok. Google is now the OEM, that's what I am saying. Another Scott Nice post. I hemmed and hawed about a Pixel XL 128 for 6 weeks last fall and finally decided I just couldn't do it. Besides the fact that it was impossible to get from Google, I just couldn't justify the price. I decided to finally replace my LG Nexus 4 (roughly $350 new) with a new T-Mobile LG V10 from B&H in November for $330 and am quite pleased. (It would have been $300 a week or so later.) I added a Samsung EVO 128 GB SDHC card for it for $40 or so. I miss the Nexus timely updates a great deal, but I can't see spending a kilobuck on a phone to get it - especially for only a 2 year OS upgrade availability. I hope Google gets the Pixel 2 right, but maybe they figure having a "premium" phone for evangelists is good enough so they won't feel any pressure to make it available (or cut the price). Cheers, Scott. fijisiv The Galaxy S8+ is $20 less than a 128GB Pixel XL Just wow. M. Luciano Right? The Pixel is by far a better value at those prices. 128 GB storage over 16, metal over glass body, better software, better security, better camera, guaranteed to be up to date for 3 years... Samsung has some great components, but as a package, Pixel seems to keep ahead at this point. Matt I believe the S8+ is 64G and has a microSD slot. M. Luciano I think you're right. IMO that makes the Pixel better. Do you prefer less with expandable option? 03grunt I live in the mountains of NC and went back to Verizon once they brought back unlimited data and luckily the local Verizon store had a Pixel XL. I think it's pretty sad that in ~ 18 months the Pixel will be EOL. M. Luciano Luckily, it won't be. Nexus and Pixel devices are guaranteed to be fully up to date for 3 years; not 2. 2 years of major updates and 3 years of security updates = 3 years of being fully up to date. Sir_Brizz That's not entirely true. They are only guaranteed to be on the latest version for 2 years. It's unlikely it will be any different than the Nexus 6 in this regard (which didn't get 7.1 but is still getting monthly security updates). M. Luciano The Pixel and Pixel XL released October 4, 2016. They're guaranteed to be fully up to date until 10/31/2019. That's 1121 days, or 3.07 years. Sir_Brizz No. You are wrong. They are only guaranteed version updates until October 2018. The Nexus 6 was guaranteed the same thing until October 2016. It did not get Android 7.1 even though it continues to get monthly security updates. What this means is that the Pixel will get at least Android 9.0 but that doesn't guarantee it will get 9.1 or 9.2 or anything else past that. It just means it will get 9.0 and monthly security updates to 9.0 for an additional year. M. Luciano I get what you're saying, but it also launches on the latest update. So using the Pixel, it launches with N, will get O after a year, will get P after a year and then is not guaranteed to get Q. Are we really going to get a Q? So during each of those three updates, N, O and P, it on the latest OS and getting monthly security updates. 2 years of updates, so long as it includes the 2nd major OS update, translates to three full years. Ever since they started the annual number and letter update, we're essentially talking about a single API version update per year (2016 had 2, including the one you're referencing which impacted Shamu). Sir_Brizz I've already pointed this out twice: look at the Nexus 6 for a first hand example of how this is going to work. The Nexus 6 will not be on the latest version of Android for three years because it is already not on the latest version of Android despite getting monthly security updates. 03grunt Thanks for clarifying! Chris Kiederer As a Nexus 5X/project Fi user, right now the Pixel is my only choice if my Nexus decides to blow up like many before it. I really hope this Android one rumor heading to the US is true, as it would give project Fi subscribers more than just a really expensive option to stay on the plan Andye82 But exactly one year from today it will be still extremely difficult if not impossible to get your hands on pixel 2 Mix "Persistent stock issues have plagued Google's first "in-house" handset from day one..." I am on my 3rd phone and I still wonder, every time I use it, if it will be like my last two phones. I have phone PTSD! Google should just pull a Nintendo and just stop producing and move on to the 2 but not fuck it up. John Doe Great job on the article, now I will be waiting for the editorial on Google's software update policy LoL PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Google's inexperience producing a smartphone They had great experience running Motorola. Ammar "Sure, Google got some things astoundingly right: the performance, the camera, the larger software experience" To be honest, these are the only reasons why I'd ever get a Pixel over any other Android phone. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ I agree with some of Radar's points as well as teh main one as I've *never* recommended the XL because I know that the vast majority of people are sheep-like followers and/or technophobes, and I defifnitely don't want part of the onus for a technophobe's major purchase that they're going to rue the second that an iPhoner mocks them. The Pixel sells itself to PowerUsers on its own merit, which, AEB the popularity of inferior and/or questionable top-sellers, clearly supports my previous assertions. JPLoureiro Deciphering of your sentences will commence............. now. Futbolrunner What? Marty I never was going to buy an HTC Pixel. Don't like HTC and the build quality doesn't deserve such a high price. jawsnnn My SOs Pixel is probably the buggiest Google phone I have used till date. The Google Assistant, voice search are consistently broken and the phone doesn't offer much else in way of justifying it's price. Will definitely buy an OEM phone next. Google's hardware experiment is dead for me. Tim Harman I wish I'd read this 2 weeks ago! Oh well. I've got a Pixel now and I do love it. I live in NZ and the version I ended up with is the American one, which means that while it supports all my LTE bands, it doesn't support Carrier Aggregation on the bands used here. So that's my excuse for why I simply MUST HAVE the P2 when it's released. Damian Stuart Wow, what a load of crap! The Pixel is a superb phone with issues affecting small numbers of devices. I have one, after moving away from the Samsung range. I have had no issues and as I don't ever intend to take a phone swimming haven't got a single complaint about it. But haters gonna hate. sebastianer @David Ruddock Don't forget the terrible compass. If you grab an iPhone 5S and a Pixel. Open Google Maps in both of them. An you start walking trough dense downtowns the whole day (closing / opening maps at different places). You will see that the Pixel compass accuracy is constantly changing every time you open maps and is a total mess while the 5S is perfectly accurate after 1-2 seconds and less than one step. I hope the next Pixel has a completely new sensor...or compass or whatever. Last 3-4 Google Phones were a mess. I think the last Google phone with more or less good compass was the galaxy nexus but I can't even remember now TechGuy22 i'm selling mine soon since i know i can sell it around 600 dollars and it's the 128GB wjrandon So glad I kept my Nexus 6P for a second year... and look at those rock solid resale values. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9d5926ba5094521287d1d54e2476d3852462178bdf74a16166f94742b435213c.jpg TechGuy22 i sold mine for 500 dollars and i bought it used too lol that's how i managed to get the XL 128GB eric messenger It depends on what phone your coming from. For most android users it is a great phone with a great camera. If your coming from an iPhone the pixel is the first great alternative to an iphone. The on device support is actually awesome and they are very quick with support issues. I am used to Nexus devices plagued with serious issues that you had to work around and while they were great phones for the price I felt they all suffered (maybe not the 6P). Anyway the point is pixel raised the bar for Android and brought it up to par with Apple. It's probably still worth buying if you have to upgrade, and you can just get the pixel 3 in 2019 or 2020. Sean You can say this about any phone at the moment....wait for next gen. As a Project Fi user I am waiting on a phone that has the cell radio to take advantage of T-mobile's new 600mhz band they are quickly rolling out...and NO, it cant be done with a software update on any phone. me me "quickly rolling out"? The spectrum is sold but not available yet as the current user vacates.... Sean NOT TRUE....they are rolling it out in areas NOW where the old TV stations have already vacated the band. Google is your friend. me me finally, you realize it was crap, was always, still now, only thing now is you changed. Never worth the money, specs so-so for the price. Islam Google Pixel poor use of space. over-priced. BS Sean People that actually OWN one dont agree........ TechGuy22 i agree and i have one. sadly, it just stopped caring about the bezel since there's nothing i can do to make it look better VAVAMk_2 6P user here with a new battery happily waiting it out for Pixel 2. Sean Boot loop much? Ernie I have had my Nexus 6p since day one of the release. I have been lucky not to have encountered the boot loop or battery problems others have reported. I love my Nexus 6p. Hope it will get Android O. Phone_Addiction Pixel 2 probably going be the same story. Google will never learn. Dean F Marsh I love my Pixel XL! Invest in a good quality case and enjoy the phone. It's really pretty decent and for a few minor quirks mentioned, and none that I have experience yet, I can't be happier. From Nexus, HTC, Samsung, to Pixel XL, this has been the best so far. Ailín Ó’S I live in Ireland and Pixel isn't even available here yet which is odd given we were a launch country for Nexus 5x/6p but hey ho. Rick Schoonmaker This is just what I like to read after getting banged by Google and Huawei with the 6P bootloop issue 1 year and 2 days (read 2 days out of warranty) after buying and being told that my only option is to buy a new phone. So after being without a phone for a week, I had to buy a Pixel XL even though I really didn't want it and especially at the ridiculous price ($860 for 32Gb.. are you effing kidding?). Matt Definitely. I got a pixel XL the very first morning when it was available in local store. Great phone, camera, software. 2 months later, the phone began to behave crazily--extra hot, microphone malfunction. Called Google support for like 10 times and had it replaced, then I put the brand new replacement on local trade platform without hesitation. Google-brand is attatractive, but does not worth that rediculous amount of money. I can get a even better performed oneplus counterpart for almost half price. Anyway, I am on my moto x 2014 with lineage os 14 and i am pretty happy. It is sufficient for me to deal with my daily work. And I also suggest to wait for the release of more flagships from variant companies to have more flexible and reasonable options. Spinkick Google seems to not be able to follow through on anything these days. It just seems like if its not sexy or cool and needs actual work, they cant be bothered. Maybe they will release another chat app in the meantime.. 2 Men-E I want the Pixel 2 XXL (Taimen). It better exist as a 5.6"+ screened device. Philip Although if you're with TMobile. It's significantly cheaper to buy the Pixel, and get your money's worth. Granted the Pixel is guaranteed two years of support, it matches with TMobile promotion pay credit time. h4rr4r They offer a discount? I thought it was just financing. Philip Yep. $325 in TMobile bill credits over two years. Which is when the Pixel 3 will be out. So you buy a Pixel, get refunded about half of the cost. And then you're ready to upgrade to the third generation. belac77 shhh, David, I just listed my Pixel for sale on Swappa! ;) Mason Andrew Maseda This entire article is just terrible and written by someone just mad they don't have one. M. Luciano lol he got one the week after I did. He's had one. Adrianus Bratanata Supply and demand. As long as there is bigger demand than supply they don't need to reduce the price drunken_bastard I disagree. All the pros you mentioned for the Pixel -- pure Android experience, performence, camera, etc -- those are all the reasons why the Pixel and Pixel XL is still the best smartphone on the market. Worried a new one is going to come out? Happens with every flagship, every year. This one doesn't have the lastest SoC? I challenge you to demonstrate real world differences in actual speed versus the Galaxy S8, which is a gorgeous handset that yet again is crippled by bloated software and long standing issues that never seem to get addressed. You cite support potentially ending in October 2018 for software updates, but that's still a longer window than any other Android flagship, and you get them day one, which Samsung and LG don't. A smartphone is more than the sum of it's parts. It's an experience. I feel on that quality alone, the Pixel and Pixel XL are the best representations to date. NeMoDoSeZ I was going to buy a 128gb Pixel XL but due to not being available I ended up waiting and purchasing a Galaxy S8+. I'm now glad things ended up the way they did because I'm loving my S8+. Rod Until Android 8 is released. Then you'll like: fuck Samsung man! My U$xxx phone is outdated, goddamnit! Owen Iverson I hate the world of tech. We've now gotten used to NEEDING the latest thing IMMEDIATELY. Its why companies like Microsoft, Adobe, and Autodesk have switched to monthly/yearly subscriptions so you have to pay for the rest of your life. "The Bluetooth performance is horrid." What metric, speed? Connectivity? "It's not waterproof." Not sure that waterproof is a common trait among all high-end phones just yet. "The bezels really are due for a shrink." I've never used a bezel-less phone, where do you pick it up or hold it? Does your finger trigger anything on the edges? "The Snapdragon 821 is officially old news." What are you running where 1) you see lag and 2) that it's an actual problem. Maybe people are replacing consoles with their phones just like they're replacing their DSLRs with their phones? "it doesn't support proper advanced network features across all four of the big US carriers." What are these advanced network features? Anyway, I know it's a phone blog, so ... D13H4RD2L1V3 Well, he means that since its successor isn't far off, and that the Pixel is still not easy to get hold of, you might be better off waiting, since the Pixel is also selling at full price still. Edward jh How can the camera be great I mean what about the pixel camera lens flare issue plaguing 1000's of users. Margaritas Ante Porcos Pixel was a disaster. The worst phone for that price. I understand some of you got the Stockholm syndrome. But some of us see the clear picture. Google simply lost this round with both hands down. Dan Yurman My Google Pixel seems to have a mind of its owns. Here's what it does without my asking it - 1. shuts down randomly and has to be restarted by holding the power button and lower end of the volume rocker for about 15 seconds; 2. randomly starts different pieces of software including a suspiciously high frequency of instances of Google Play Music, which I have since disable, 3. Starts the flashlight from the pull down menu if the phone is placed face down on a shiny flat surface, 4 And randomly starts other programs after unlocking the phone with a pin. On the plus side the camera does good work and the phone is easily held in one hand and scrolled with fingers from the same hand while eating hit wings with the other. :-) Ray I'm very glad I read this article. I was on the fence - and almost pulled the trigger the other day but very glad I didn't now. I'll wait for the next gen and hopefully it's a much better piece of kit - and possibly cheaper. lomsha Whaaaat, you don't say. rockon999 My 2015 Moto X PE's display stopped functioning properly and I needed a new device to *function* in my daily life. So I bought a pixel, yesterday. To address your complaints... I never use Bluetooth on a phone, I'm getting a case, I'll hate the speakers (but I really only use headphones), I'm no bezel snob, and finally... waterproofing? My Moto X PE was waterproofed and I can honestly say it never aided me in one single way. Sure, it felt great using the phone in the rain that one time. But I'm fairly certain an encased pixel can survive that. I know it is probably a horrible value, but I really don't want to deal with buying a $200 phone now, selling it later for $100, and then buying a new $900 phone in a few months. I don't have time to constantly be reselling and selling my devices and I don't have a spare $100 to just throw around on a device. Slurms Mckenzie Seriously have been saying most of what this article is about since day one. I have a pixel XL and I've hated it since receiving it. It's not worth what Google asks when everything that is offered can be had for half the money (quick updates not included) for that asking price it should at least offer sd card support which is something even the most basic phones have. I've been using Nexus phones since the beginning (skipped the 6) and the problems with them were expected as it was a budget friendly phone but if you want to charge premium pricing don't use cloth for your ear piece cover, have dual speakers, and for God's sake don't make deals with the devil (Verizon) to lock down MIMO as a carrier specific feature when every damn phone is capable of and and most carriers are as well F*** you Pixel XL you sack of shit what a waste of 800 bucks Rod Best camera Google photos unlimited backup at original resolution Best performance Lowest touch latency of all Android phones "Just" that. micahthomas Basically all you're saying is wait if a new version is going to be released in 6 months. Might as well just say that, doesn't really have anything to do with if it's iPhone or Android. JG I was about to order my mother a 32GB Pixel a week or so ago to replace her Nexus 5X. I recently discovered the glass of its camera lens has a pretty decent crack in it. It doesn't seem to affect pictures - yet... But we're planning a fairly photogenic trip this summer and I figured the Pixel has a better camera and has unlimited free full resolution Google Photos uploads so... But as I was about to click the "Add to Cart" button, I thought we're not all that far from the expected October release of the Pixel 2. I'm sure mom wouldn't mind being a generation behind, but... derk p just replace the housing on hers. i bought a white one but then wanted a blue back... was cheap on ebay and is very easy to snap on and snap off dizel123 Relatively speaking we're not too far from October of next year for the Pixel 3. Or October 2019 for the Pixel 4... toast I never buy Apple, and I never buy Samsung. But both of their hardware just feel slicker than the Pixel. As the article says, knock a few hundred off the price, and I'd be a keen buyer, mainly for the camera and fast OS updates, and Google "Purity". I'll wait and see how the upcoming Moto Z and X phones turn out. Defenestratus It'll be difficult for me to go back to a Google phone after the nightmare that was my 6P. Major Sceptic Availability is no problem in my neck of the woods , and I appreciate the work Google did on the camera as a point and shoot and smooth software , but after looking at the pixels they looked a bit underwhelming in the feature department , and then as mentioned the outrageous​ prices for the pixels I wouldn't go near one . I might add with the smooth software , Google no longer has the Monopoly on as most devices with 7.0 onwards are very good . Rod What feature does it miss? redsoxwin I'm not sure what this person's agenda is, but this is great phone. Strange article. Amie Perry Porter I personally love my Pixel phone. Will Dutton I never cease to be amazed that everyone always thinks that 'the next one will fix it' with android John Quincy Adams Whining about bezels is ignorance. Without bezels, how do you hold it? . ..please, bezel whiners...answer this... gar216 I'm a happy Nexus 6p user. Even prior to launch I couldn't justify upgrading my 7 month old 6p to a Pixel XL. It would have clearly been an upgrade, but I didn't think it was enough of an upgrade for the price. Also... It's kinda ugly. SiliconAddic "The Google Pixel is a notoriously hard phone to get a hold of. Persistent stock issues have plagued Google's first "in-house" handset from day one, and things really are little to no better in the six months since the launch event. " Um BS. Google has ALWAYS his issues with distribution. The Nexus 5 had this issue, the Nexus 6 had this problem, the 6p also had this problem and now the pixel. Google is incompetent when it comes to this. Meanwhile Apple can launch a new phone and you can walk into any of their stores and pick one up. I wanted a Pixel to replace my Nexus 6, could not get one. I ended up with a S7 edge. Google and Nintendo should team up with their inability to ship jack ****. Eric How does this stand to affect the resale value / trade-in value for current pixel owners under project fi? I'm asking as someone who switched to project fi from Verizon prepaid in early January, and has almost been regretting it ever since. I am a quadriplegic in a power wheelchair to whom the pixel with Google Assistant seemed a natural front runner, due to its voice capabilities, and project fi with it's much touted multi Network and Wi-Fi hopping capabilities seemed a good decision as well. Did my due dilligence and the 4G network to all appearances covered me completely, even though I live with my elderly parents in a rural area. The only option available for order at the time was a white Pixel (not XL) and 32gb. I was nervous about the 32 part at the time, but felt comfortable with the infinite backup capability of Google photos. Now, 3 1/2 months later, not only is service spotty, audio crackly despite not being a candidate for replacement under the microphone bug, and Google's customer service... Let us politely say not the most helpful on the issue. I apologize about the length of this comment, (and after reading over it I really should have made it a direct message) but the difference between a phone worth $600 and the phone worth $300 in retail/tradein is quite a big deal to someone like me, and as much as I love my pixel (and admire/fear/respect Google) getting out while the getting is good is starting to sound the smarter move. ( especially after the 180 they made on the 5x.... Grrrrr) Was curious to get an educated opinion on the subject. Thanks again for your ( and anyone else's who has read this far) time and any insight offered! dizel123 Opinion: Even if you can, you probably shouldn't read David Ruddock's articles anymore. Adam Myself having been using the Pixel since day one, I would agree to an extent... Would I go out a purchase a brand new Pixel/Pixel XL for full retail? Of course not! Only because the new iteration is just around the corner. Now, would I go buy a Galaxy S8 or an iPhone 7? No way, wouldn't even consider it! I have switched phones at least every 6 months for the past 3 to 4 years, between Android and iOS operating systems as well... Having said that, the Pixel has been the best phone and best experience that I have had to date! This is the first time that I haven't thought about what phone I want to get next, and to be honest there would have to be significant improvements for me to even get the newest iteration when it comes out this fall. This phone as just been that good. To sum things up... I would not buy the Pixel/Pixel XL right now at full retail cost, I definitely would NOT go out and buy a Galaxy S8 or an iPhone either... If you, like myself, really love the Pixel line and want to get one and don't already own one. I would suggest trying to hold out and get the newest release this fall. It's most definitely worth the wait! D13H4RD2L1V3 Google always seems to have issues with stocking ever since the Nexus days. Pretty embarrassing that it's still hard to get a hold of one after 6 months. Probably due for a small price cut soon, as newer phones roll out. me me yeah I loved Nexus back with Nexus 4, 5, 7. Now the Nexus banner is carried by the likes of Moto G, OnePlus.... H2OSKI So true. The bluetooth issues alone nearly make this phone unusable. Drops and cutout's every 20 seconds. Get this, my Pixel was fine UNTIL Google sent out "the server side" update to fix the Bluetooth issues my phone never had!!! Thanks Google. Mine is going back this week. Great camera crap bluetooth. I take pics occasionally​ but I need to use a bluetooth headset hours a day. Multiple headphones, headsets, and vehicle connections with all the same result...even in safe mode. Fail. Daishi Google shot themselves in the foot when they gussied up an HTC 10 and called it a Pixel. It is just any other Android phone and doesn't have the support behind it to justify the price. Six months along, it should be more than 50% off. William Ross Why the hell is this idiot comparing a 6 month old device to the newer releases? A year in smartphone years is a lifetime. That being said, the pixel still has the best most up to date software bar none! The camera is still among the best if not the best. And, although the 835 is a newer processor, the 821 is no slouch. GTFOH with this garbage article. And, I'll definitely be getting the next Pixel regardless of price. And, I'll sell my original on eBay for a pretty penny. And, this baby has no scratches any where. It's always been in a case and all glass has been protected by Liquid Armor. diggie Pixel is a $650+ phone built like a budget chinese phone. And sorry, Oneplus has Google beat on OS features while keeping "stock" feel. William Ross Oh here we go again with the one plus fans always hating on the pixel. If your phone is so great then why knock the pixel? I just don't get it. Just talk about how great your actual Chinese knockoff is. No need to hate in the Pixel. The one plus has little more than a cult following and mock my words, it'll never be a mainstream device. me me Android Police and a lot of its customers are hating the Pixel. The OnePlus fans just chime in. I own a OP3T. It simply works, yep even Bluetooth. When take tax into account, its about half the price. OnePlus fans biggest concern: price creep upwards. $300 becomes $350 becomes $390 becomes.... Goblin Shark Is this article from April 1st? Absolutely no one with any knowledge of phone tech recommended a Pixel, ever! Underspeced and overpriced, I doubt there's any trouble keeping them in stock they just know nobody wants them so they're not making any. Rod Under-spec'ed? Ok Underperforming? Nope Edgar Morales I honestly don't see what the problem is I purchased my pixel XL and have not to date had any issues whatsoever with it no Bluetooth issues no speaker issues nothing everyone is saying Michael Hannigan Hey, if you get a phone you love and it lasts just under a year, that's good enough. What more do you expect for a few hundred bucks. Appreciate the year you loved that thing and then replace it with a new one that you can love even more. Tom Takumi Okamoto OnePlus is a better phone maker than Google. A company not even 1% worth of Google. I really want a Pixel but it's not practical. Ionut Lala I'm sorry but that is clearly not a first generation device. Not the first from Google (made by HTC and let's not forget about the Nexus line). And not the first from HTC (for obvious reasons). Aquan Belk I wish other Android manufacturers went to stock Android. I know Samsung shines in it's own apps on top of Android but vanilla Android still is and always will be the best. Rod You heard the man, people. Don't buy a Pixel because it will have bad resale value and won't be updated for long. Instead, get a model that will have bad resale value and won't be updated for long, plus has worst performance, buggy software and worse camera performance. You're welcome. Stephonz My last Google phone was Nexus 5. As much as I like pure Android experience, Google has a bigheaded trend in phones. The price point was my biggest no no after the 5X. They don't offer as much features as the other well known Android companies.. amir80 I have a Pixel 32 gb and I really really like it. Everything works great and the camera is amazing and also the battey life. For me, the fingerprint sensor is a must. The S8 sensor is poorly located and the G6 sensor is too small. GeorgeDao123 Absolutely. The Pixel duo are 2 pieces of $#!¶. They run pure Android version and they are so slow to boot up and open apps though they are lag-free. Neru Nexus I've had a pixel since launch day. For one I don't agree with the bluetooth issues. Keep the phone up to date or use the bluetooth connect and play app to automate things. Second it is a over priced phone but so is an iPhone. The main reason real users should get a pixel is the updates. Sure you might need to learn something about that expensive piece of tech you bought and not just sit on your hands waiting for the apples or googles of the world to update your shit, but at least google gave us source code, kernel code and a unlocked bootloader. There are still updates being made for the old nexus 5, that's like 5 years old. Grab iphone 4s and tell me again about how fucking great those updates are lol. You can't even install apps like skype or whatsapp that thing is pooched. I can promise the world that even if google stops updating the pixel in 2018 there will be updated versions of the os you can manually install for years. Let's see if you can get more then one firmware update on your fancy new samsung s8. My money is on 1, then the s9 will launch a year later and samsung just won't care about the s8. rjcuk What if you want a slightly smaller phone? The S8 is 5.8" compared to the Pixel at 5". I really struggle to hold 6" phones. Even the Nexus 5X at 5.2" was too big to grip properly and comfortably. Janoo Ramachandran DON'T BUY A PIXEL. We have 2 Pixels at home. One bought early November 16 and the other end Jan 17. The one I was gifted this January, within 40 days had microphone related issues. I could not hear anyone on the phone, nor was the music being played out. They refused a replacement. My phone sat in the repair centre for 8 plus day and the mother board replaced. Have you ever heard of a new phone device of any other brand needing a mother board replacement in leads than 45 days WELL GOOGLE PHONE PIXEL NEEDED IT. The other phone bought early November 16 started having other issues last month and it wasn't recognizing the wifi. After at least 20 hours on the phone with the terrible google support, it had to be sent to the repair centre where it was kept for 2 weeks, you heard that right 16 days to be precise. Then the phone came back with a chip replaced. SHOULD YOI BUY A PIXEL EVER. :. NEVER SHOULD YOU LOOK AT GOOGLE AS A PHONE MAKER :. NEVER Nikhil I wholeheartedly concur here. I picked up a Pixel sometime around December which had to be promptly returned for a replacement as the volume rocker was rickety. The replacement didn't last long either. Within a month, the widely acknowledged microphone issues popped up and after almost 15 days of talking to the very incompetent Google support in India, their only resolution was to take the Pixel to the service center. The service center did not have the motherboard in stock (they had to bring it all the way from Taiwan) and my phone still languishes there even after 15 days of me submitting it. The phone suffers from not only just Gen-one product issues, but also terrible after sales support. Leonardo Baez Agree.... ait for the next generation THEN buy current generation cheaper. Jeremy Allan Actual customer service? You do realize that owners of a pixel get free 24/7 support any time, on a dedicated line for pixel owners? Exalm There is the same section in the settings on Nexus 5X and 6P. No idea whether it works, since there's no chat or phone support in Russia neither for Nexus nor Pixel. Cory Wilson I agree. Granted it was around a year ago I bought my 6p but the 6p didn't cost $870 either. Still don't regret that decision Impulse_Vigil Haven't really had any serious Pixel Bluetooth issues here... A handful of times (literally less than half a dozen) BT shut itself off back in Feb-March, hasn't happened again since the Play Services patch. I use Bluetooth on a daily 24/7 basis too with my ZenWatch 3, car audio, etc. I don't push it to its range limits tho. Dunno whether David's usage and issue is some sorta edge case, or range related, or whether he was speaking to the 1-2 month period when others were having more severe Bluetooth shut off issues. I do agree with the overall sentiment tho, Google hasn't made it easy to buy the Pixel and that's simply inexcusable. I haven't had to suffer thru any of the QC issues (no BT, mic, whatever issues here, knock on wood) but it seems they weren't handled super well either. To be honest I wouldn't even recommend the S8 to anyone either unless it's another geek/enthusiast, these days for most people it's simply not worth it to spend that kind dosh on a phone. I bought my mother a Moto Z Play; I'd probably point others towards that, the OP3, or an HTC One/S7 on sale. I'm super happy with my Pixel, but if there was a OnePlus 3-class device for Zoglog Having owned a pixel XL and now a s8+, I'd have to agree. Even not taking into account the questionable hardware reliability of the pixel (mine died in 5 months). Basically when I owned the pixel I loved the hell out of stock Android but I kept on wondering why I paid so much for it. Meanwhile with the S8+ the gorgeous screen makes it feel especially special and worth the price. Even though I would prefer stock Android 10000% sebastianer Pixel is just another Nexus. Like the 6P. There is no excuse, this is not their first premium phone. Still made by HTC instead of Huawei. And called Pixel instead of Nexus...and more expensive because of HTC and all the marketing costs. And..still has the shitty compass all their recent previous nexus had with a lot of topics open in Google product forums and staff giving tons of manuals about how to perfect calibrate something that doesn't retain calibration. But the main reason I wouldn't buy a Pixel...is the compass and secondly that you will get one more android update if you wait 6 months. username_not_valid How is the pixel the first 'in-house Google phone'? Its clearly and actually a slightly rehashed HTC. HTC doesn't just make it ,they designed it for all intents and purposes. Unless Googles design strategy happens to be exactly like HTCs then its not a Google phone. The Pixel is just an over priced nexus, nothing else. SOUL- Always great to see the smartphone community go from praising a phone to outright basing it just after a couple of months. Perfectly fine with my Pixel. Michael Sørensen It's just ... really boring. andy mckenzie It's a superb phone , blazing fast so processor is not an issue , amazing camera , free storage , online support has been fast and efficient in my experience, stock Android , I'd highly recommend to anyone. remister I am still using my 6P, I couldn't swallow the 1K price tag for 128GB with insurance.... Justin Field Yeah, I broke the screen on my 5x, and since I am on Fi I considered getting a pixel for about 2 seconds and ordered and new screen and fixed my phone. I will wait for the next gen or switch off of Fi.

Google rolls out similar audiences for Search and Shopping Now out of beta, similar audiences for Search enables advertisers to target users searching for the same kinds of things as recent site visitors. Ginny Marvin on May 1, 2017 at 3:45 pm More AmsStudio / Shutterstock.com Google announced the long-awaited rollout of similar audiences for Search on Monday. Similar audiences can be built from past site visitors — remarketing lists for search ads (RLSA). The company also officially announced the global availability of Customer Match targeting for Shopping campaigns. Google first teased the expansion of similar audiences from display to search-based campaigns last May. With similar audiences for search, Google targets users searching for the same things as users recently added to RLSA lists –meaning it takes into consideration the kinds of searches users were performing when they landed — or even converted — on an advertiser’s site. An example from Google: Say you’ve created a remarketing list of people who bought running shoes from your sporting goods site. Instead of helping you reach broad groups of people interested in “running,” similar audiences will identify that people on this list tended to search for “triathlon training” and “buy lightweight running shoes” before coming to your site and making a purchase. Based on this, similar audiences will then find other people with similar search behavior, such as people who searched for ‘buy lightweight running shoes’. Lists are constantly and automatically updated as users change their search activity. And, once a user visits a site, they’ll no longer be included on the similar audiences list. Amy McNeil, head of digital marketing at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles US, which beta tested the similar audiences for search, told Google, “In less than two months, similar audiences for search delivered an 11 percent increase in clickthrough rate and 22 percent more conversions across our test campaigns.” John Deere and GameStop were among the other beta testers. Remarketing lists will automatically qualify for similar audiences expansion when they meet certain criteria, including having at least 1,000 cookies and enough recent participants who exhibited similar search behaviors. You’ll find them listed under Audiences in the Shared Library. Note that similar audience lists do not apply to sensitive categories. Advertisers can apply similar audiences to Search and Shopping campaigns and add bid modifiers to the audiences. Customer Match for Shopping campaigns allows advertisers to target existing customers with Shopping ads — for new styles and so on — in addition to text ads.

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   Google’s former HR chief Laszlo Bock and another high-profile ex-Googler launch startup Humu ‘to make work better everywhere’ By Ethan Baron / May 1, 2017 at 2:33 PM There’s something fishy about Laszlo Bock’s new startup. Not that there’s anything improper about the enterprise. It’s just that it’s named after a fish. Fortunately, Bock and his colleagues at their just-launched human resources company see the virtues of abbreviation. The fish in question, whose image graces the home page of the startup, is called “humuhumunukunukuapuaa” in Hawaiian. It might be a bit tough to make a splash with such an unwieldy moniker, so Bock and his team, being bright folks, have cut it down considerably. The startup is called Humu, Bock revealed May 1 on LinkedIn. “Congrats!” a Google operations manager said in a comment appended to Bock’s post. “Was humuhumunukunukuapuaa.com taken?” What, exactly, Humu will do remains a mystery. For months, in fact, mystery has surrounded this new project from Bock, Google’s legendary former head of HR, credited as the architect of Googliness, Googlishness or whatever defines the tech giant’s workplace culture. Bock announced in December he was leaving Google, saying in an email to friends and associates that he was working on a startup that would be in “stealth mode” for a while. “It hinges on a few ideas: that every job can have meaning, that if you give people freedom they will amaze you, that applied science (which I dubbed ‘people analytics’ a decade back) can illuminate the truth about what really makes people happy and productive, and that it doesn’t take a ton of effort or investment to make things better … but that you can make work better, everywhere,” Bock said in the email. The HR wizard, responsible for innovations at Google including data-driven hiring and free-food cafeterias, popped his head up out of stealth mode briefly in February to attack President Donald Trump’s ill-fated ban on visitors from seven mostly Muslim countries. The former refugee from Communist Romania then chose International Workers Day to announce on LinkedIn that he and Wayne Crosby, who just jumped ship as director of engineering at Google after nearly 10 years with the company, were launching a new firm. “If we’re devoting most of our lives to work, that experience should be meaningful, impactful, productive,” Bock said on LinkedIn. “We should be constantly learning and growing, and surrounded by people who are doing the same. We all have good days and bad days, but what would work be like if every day were like our best days? Imagine what we could achieve. “That’s why Wayne Crosby and I have started humu. Our mission is to make work better everywhere through science, machine learning, and a little bit of love.” That mission statement, plus a photo of the reef triggerfish with the exceptionally long name, are all that grace Humu’s home page, and there are no links to other pages. It does appear that the enterprise focuses on HR, given Bock’s somewhat cryptic descriptions, and because its website is “humuhr.com.” Perhaps in keeping with some revolutionary new HR practice, Bock in his LinkedIn post invited job applications to two email addresses, without providing any job descriptions. However, in a comment below his LinkedIn post he promised that job links would be up on the company’s website soon.   Photo: The humuhumunukunukuapuaa or reef triggerfish, whose name is abbreviated to Humu for the name of former Google HR boss Laszlo Bock’s new startup (Wikimedia Commons/Bernard Spragg) Share this: Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Reddit Google More Pinterest Tumblr   Tags: Google, HR, human resources, humu, Laszlo Bock, launch, startup   More Posts in 1 Uber and Lyft, watch out: SFO airport wants to use license-plate scanners to keep self-driving cars off its roads April 28, 2017   Google and Facebook scammed out of $100 million in online phishing fraud, allegedly by Lithuanian: report April 27, 2017   Drunk man attacks Mountain View security robot, police say April 26, 2017       Share this Post Tweet               Tweets from @siliconbeat/siliconbeat   Popular Posts Apple has how much cash?

I couldn't disagree more vehemently. Yesterday's antitrust laws can't regulate today's technology, but they sure as heck can certainly destroy its profit potential. And, unfortunately, yours, too. Here's what you need to know… and how to defend your money against government meddling. The Government Wants a Piece of Google Pie Jonathan Taplin is no slouch. In fact, he's a very bright guy who is the Director Emeritus of the University of Southern California's Annenberg Innovation Lab. Normally, I agree with him – especially when it comes to Silicon Valley, which he characterizes as being populated by a bunch of spoiled, ignorant brats who are clueless when it comes to the consequences of their actions… to which I'll add, "and their products." There is nothing more frustrating to me than knowing Google – aka Alphabet Inc. (Nasdaq: GOOGL) – dominates today's digital world. Speaking personally, I hate the fact that every digital footprint I leave is tagged somewhere by some company unknown to me that's anxious to sell it to the highest bidder in an effort to "monetize" my behavior. And, while we're at it, I loathe the fact that the technology is increasingly being sold to medical providers, insurance companies, financial providers – all of which are using it to deliver "targeted" advertising and services to me at prices that somehow always seem higher than they used to be. The very term is an insult. But having the government break Google up?! No way. The markets will take care of that all by themselves, and investors who are along for the ride will do very well by letting that happen instead of falling prey to out of touch regulators who don't understand what's going on. Take Google's browser, Chrome, for example. It's got an 88% market share of browser traffic because competing browsers like Microsoft's Internet Explorer stinks and Yahoo's ill-fated Axis stunk. Users selected Google because they liked it and found it valuable. The argument that antitrust regulation works on behalf of the consumer is a four letter word that I can't print. When you take a closer look, most of the people complaining about big monopolies are not consumers, but other suppliers who stand to benefit if there's enforcement action. Naturally, regulators will try to sell the breakup as a great story. Instead of trying to help existing and new companies develop, the government wants to compete by punishing the successful. They always have – with railroads, with oil, with airlines – and now they're going to do it with technology (and, if this idea gathers steam, with Alphabet Inc., specifically). People don't realize it, but the Justice Department, working in concert with a wide variety of Washington agencies, has canned a number of deals over the past few years, including Sysco Corp.'s (NYSE: SYY) attempt to buy U.S. Foods, Comcast Corp.'s (Nasdaq: CMCSA) attempt to purchase Time Warner Cable (NYSE: TWX), Staples Inc. (Nasdaq: SPLS), and Office Depot Inc. (Nasdaq: ODP), just to name a few. Things are so egregious that even Thai Union (OTCMKTS: TUFBY), which makes Chicken of the Sea, was stopped from buying Bumble Bee Tuna back in 2015, for crying out loud. Tuna fish!  What Policy Wonks Are Missing The last thing a regulator should want to do is hobble one of the world's most successful companies. Doing so will squash innovation and destroy hundreds of billions of dollars in shareholder value – much of which is in retirement plans. The numbers are hard to come by, but this is especially important when you consider that individual households may own as much as 80% of the corporate equity market when you combine the estimated 38% of stocks owned directly by U.S. households with the indirect ownership associated with mutual funds, pension funds, and insurance policy investments. I can all but guarantee that regulators haven't thought about how much wealth they'll destroy if they move ahead. And, of course, that's also part of the problem. Companies like Alphabet are completely changing the face of what we think about regulation, utilities, government, structure – you name it – specifically because they're unconventional, innovative, and empowering. Like the other companies in the so-called "Fabulous Five" we talk about frequently, Alphabet has become so integral to our lives that it's a "must-have." I'm not surprised in the least that the company rubs Washington's inner circle the wrong way because it bypasses what they consider to be the proper relationship between those who rule and those who follow. Big Companies Are Not Anti-Competitive – Antitrust Laws Are Antitrust laws have their roots in the Sherman Act of 1890 and the Federal Trade Commission Act and Clayton Act of 1914, all of which are intended to ensure lower prices, efficient competition, and higher quality in the name of consumer protection. Here's the rub… Unlike most laws, which have a very clear-cut basis for what's right or wrong, antitrust laws are based on an unreasonable restraint of trade. That means they're decided on a case-by-case basis. Obviously certain things like price fixing and bid rigging are so blatant that they're considered "per se" violations, a legal term meaning there is no justification nor allowable defense under the law.  But – and you'll see where I'm going with this in a minute – violations are determined one by one. The Justice Department, acting on input from global regulators worried about competition and product development in more than 30 markets, has iced deals left and right to in the name of "consumer protection." This makes plenty of sense to government watchdogs who would rather use government policy as a punitive measure than a tool for national ambition and success. Yet, it makes no sense whatsoever to anybody interested in actual competition, let alone profits. Never mind that this country and capitalism are based on opportunity, not coercion. Government apparatchiks cannot understand the very fundamentals of capitalism let alone how money actually works. Every individual and company has the right to enter any market they choose and to sell goods and services at a price that the market will bear. Nobody is forced to sell and nobody is forced to buy. Ever. The hypocrisy is staggering. Microsoft isn't going to roll over and let Apple take over huge sections of its business simply because it's too dominant with a 90% market share. The DOJ's said nothing. Amazon isn't going to pause to let Alibaba gain ground because it's feeling guilty about the fact that the company accounted for more than 50% of e-commerce volume growth last year. The DOJ's taken no action. Facebook isn't going to slow down now that it accounts for 43.9% of all social media site visits, let alone give that back to MySpace because it's been too successful. The DOJ's been silent. Or consider Becton, Dickinson and Co. (NYSE: BDX) when it bought CareFusion Corp. in 2015. In fact, we specifically noted the merger as a catalyst for higher profits when I brought it to subscribers' attention in our sister publication, the Money Map Report, and gave anybody who followed along the opportunity to capture triple-digit returns of at least 163% since. Nobody raised a stink when Vincent Forlenza, Becton Dickinson's chairman, noted specifically that the deal was a major milestone in the company's 118-year history and "significantly accelerates BD's strategy" … "as we become one of the largest global leaders in medical technology." At the end of the day, the only true monopoly is the government because it's the only entity capable of using force to intervene in otherwise free markets. Businesses cannot force consumers to do anything in truly free markets. Should You Still Invest in Alphabet? Now, let me get off my soapbox and talk about how you make money in a situation like this. That is, after all, why we're all here. Without hesitation – you should be buying shares of Alphabet Inc. even if you have to do it one share at a time and even if it's flirting with all-time highs. Alphabet is the ultimate digital equivalent of completely free choice – and customers love it because it's innovative, efficient, and profitable. But you have to buy it ahead of time – meaning before the government push to break it up gathers momentum. (Or risk getting left far behind.) At the end of the day, it's not Alphabet that the regulators find so threatening but the innovation driving it. That's why the company is far more valuable than they'll ever understand. Investors simply cannot afford to miss the boat. The company is also one of the top five holdings in what I like to call the "Blue Chip Hall of Famer" program. It's just one of several my team dug up, and belongs to a special class of investments you can get in on today. I call them "26(f) programs." They give investors the opportunity to earn aggressive monthly income combined with huge lump-sum payouts. You can potentially get paid $2,000… $5,000… even more… every month for the rest of your life And on top of that, there are 26(f) programs that can operate as 100% legal tax havens.

Opinion: Even if you can, you probably shouldn't buy a Google Pixel anymore David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/05/01 2:09pm PDTMay 1, 2017 66 Plus 1 on G+ 263 Share on Facebook 60 Share on Twitter Total Shares389 Editorials Pixel Pixel XL The Google Pixel is a notoriously hard phone to get a hold of. Persistent stock issues have plagued Google's first "in-house" handset from day one, and things really are little to no better six months after the launch event. Honestly, it's a bit embarrassing just how consistently incompetent Google seems to be at keeping a reasonable inventory of phones available for purchase. But setting that aside, as one of the Pixel's most ardent evangelists, I think there's something it's probably time for me to come clean on: Even if you could buy a Pixel today, I really think you shouldn't. The Pixel is a product with generation-one product issues. The Bluetooth performance is horrid. It's not waterproof. The bezels really are due for a shrink. I don't think the exterior coating on the black and blue variants is of a particularly high quality. The glass window gets scuffed up incredibly easily. The Snapdragon 821 is officially old news. And it doesn't support proper advanced network features across all four of the big US carriers. There are other flaws I could point to, and while none of them are too terrible, they do speak to the slightly-rushed development cycle this phone seems to have been subjected to. Sure, Google got some things astoundingly right: the performance, the camera, the larger software experience. In fact, I think the Pixel is easily the best Android smartphone ever for these strengths, at least if we're talking about me personally as a user (your mileage, obviously, may vary). But for all the great, smooth, fast, clean, pure, simple, natural, and various other adjective-members singing in the Pixel-praise cavalcade, this phone is not the one to buy right now. For starters, Google continues to ask what is an increasingly laughable amount of money for the model most of us want - the 128GB XL - at a staggering $870. Sure, Apple charges the same for an iPhone 7 Plus 128GB, but I'm under no illusion that this comparison in any way favors Google. The iPhone comes with Apple customer service (with actual stores), a longer software support period going forward, and runs no real risk of poor resale value. The Pixel? Google's online support is iffy at best, we know the phone will be unsupported by October 2018, and I have a strong feeling generation-one Pixel resale values will drop like a rock once the new phones are announced. And that really is why, if you haven't pulled the trigger on a Pixel yet, you should just wait. It's overpriced, under-supported, and competing phones like the Galaxy S8 offer a whole lot more technology for your money. The Galaxy S8+ is $20 less than a 128GB Pixel XL, and I would argue it is far and away the better smartphone value. That amazing display, brand-new Snapdragon 835 processor, jaw-dropping design and packaging, and the full support of all our American carriers' latest LTE advancements could each be a reason on its own to put the Galaxy S8 above Google's smartphone. Do I still prefer using the Pixel over the S8? Sure. But I wouldn't buy a 128GB Pixel XL over a Galaxy S8+ today. That would be, frankly, a bit silly. If Google was asking $670 and not $870, the discussion would probably change, but they aren't. You've got to pay full price, and there's no way I could recommend anyone do that. If you're still on the fence about the Pixel, let me try to push you over: wait for the next generation. I realize that this sort of thinking can devolve into a rationale that encourages you to never upgrade anything because something newer, faster, and better is constantly on the horizon. But in this case, I think it's a consideration that is worth weighing more seriously than usual. Many of the Pixel's biggest flaws relate to Google's inexperience producing a smartphone. Issues that only come up as you try to mass-produce and distribute a product with a real marketing campaign that creates real demand, and the phone gets into the hands of "real" users who aren't part of the now-derailed Nexus phone hypetrain. Inside Google, expectations were no doubt managed, realities realized, and priorities accordingly re-calibrated after this first launch. (Side note: if the Bluetooth performance on the next Pixel is as bad as the first one, I may scream, Google.) Meanwhile, the things that make the Pixel great aren't going anywhere. The next Pixel will be fast, it will take great photos, and it will offer a wonderfully unfettered Android experience. Those that make it less than great? Google is no doubt drilling down through the worst of them in order to ensure the Pixel 2 - or whatever it's called - won't make the same mistakes that the original did (waterproofing, please). And one of the primary reasons to try the Pixel in the first place - to be on the very bleeding edge - really only remains true from a software standpoint. Older phones like the Nexus 5X and 6P don't even let the Pixel have an advantage there, as they're on the same update track until around the time the next Pixel phones launch. If you absolutely need a smartphone soon and the Pixel is tempting you, ask yourself this: Can you deal with a Moto G5 Plus for six months if it means having a better Pixel down the road? While as a reviewer I have the admitted luxury of not needing to consider such things, were I in such a position, I'd have little in the way of a counterargument to offer. Sure, you'll take a resale hit on anything you buy now, but the Pixel is going to face a much, much steeper devaluation curve in that time than any budget phone. Buying a Pixel right now just doesn't make sense. I love my Pixel XL, but I'm officially done recommending the phone to friends and relatives. Instead, I'll tell them to wait, or to get the Galaxy S8 they were probably going to buy anyway. Tags editorial google pixel google pixel xl opinion pixel xl subscribe ...

Google really shot themselves in the foot with availability. My name is…. No, they shot their foot with huge bezels, with lack of waterproof, lack of dual speakers, no real camera progress compared to nexii, meh battery life, meh screen. No real selling point besides being pure android phone. This phone had iphone price but was worst on so many levels (no A10 SoC, no iphone-fast NAND, no 4yrs updates) Oneplus on the other hand........ M. Luciano Also has none of that stuff, but is cheaper? My name is…. yes, half price cheaper. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ The black screen issue kind of negates anything else ;) Michael Hannigan What's the "black screen issue"? Carson Saldanha YOU WANT THE PIXEL TO HAVE THE A10 CHIP?? BHAAAAAAAHAHAHA My name is…. No, i want it to have a cheaper price, or be better somehwere else, like the Galaxy. STOP BEING RUDE Carson Saldanha https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CYF7C6hVAAAKF-_.jpg Tr3ple Shut up troll ,nobody likes you I see lmao My name is…. You know when you see the dumb guy, he always adds 'lol' or 'lmao' at the end of his sentence. And his syntax is always wrong. STFU and GTFO Liam Bulkley "You know when you see the dumb guy... And his syntax is always wrong." "You are an [sic] ignorant" Don't cut yourself on the glass. Michael Hannigan They have that - The Nexus 5x. Тарас Мукин You keep hating Pixel in the comments, but you only look at numbers. But they doesn't matter when it comes to Google. Software experience does. My name is…. That's a stupid argument Тарас Мукин And saying that somebody's argument is stupid without any explanation is a much smarter argument. My name is…. Would you pay 900$ bucks for Nexus 5 just because "Software experience matters"?? Carson Saldanha Nobody said they were paying just for the "software experience" Matt Tapac said that specs don't matter, the software experience does. That heavily implies that people are paying for the software experience. Carson Saldanha xD here we go again drunken_bastard Pixel and Pixel XL have better cameras and screens than any iPhone. The difference in SoC and other bits of hardware, they don't translate into any real world speed differences. Pixel also has great battery life. Perhaps some hands on time may do you some good. supersanborn Given that they continually sell out of the limited stock they have, none of what you cited matters. If they had a ginormous supply of units and THEN couldn't sell, then perhaps you would be on to something. My name is…. What was the availability in the first place? You think they produced many? No way Jose, i bet Galaxies and iphones outsold pixels by multiple times supersanborn We don't exactly know what they had hoped to produce or even what they actually produced, so your point remains conjecture. And who here is suggesting that Samsung and Apple phones didn't outsell the Pixel? My name is…. * by multiple times James Betti Sadly, Google isn't keeping the Pixel in stock because they don't care about their hardware line. Google makes most of its money through ads and personal data. It's a shame, but it explains why they discontinue successful products and barely have much in stock. Excellent phone by the way. Michael Hannigan Well, that's easy to rectify. Do like Amazon and offer the same exact hardware with "special offers" for a lower price. Then you get to see ads everywhere, even your home screen and app drawer. Pretty cool. Michael Hannigan Yes, they did. It was in the millions. Max "no real camera progress compared to nexii, meh battery life, meh screen." Ok, so you don't have a Pixel, we get it. My name is…. I'm not dumb, do you get that too? Xchris I think the consensus here is that you are talking bollocks. The pixel XL has an unbelievably good screen, one of the best battery life figures, still has the best camera out of any smartphone. Nobody who bought the pixel cares that much about any of your other points. In fact, what you are really saying is that you didn't like the pixel. Big deal! My name is…. Actually, i'm fighting the pixel in a nerdy community. Its expected that the consensus is that "i am talking bollocks". People here mainly wanna root their phones and put center clocks on status bar. they did the same with Nexii devices, its all about the software, but those phones were seriosly lacking (i used to own all Nexus devices after 4) Carson Saldanha So may I ask, what phone do you use now? My name is…. 1+3 Carson Saldanha Srsly!?!? Bruh, the OnePlus 3 has a Snapdragon 820 while the Pixel has a 821, a far better camera, better performance, and software. How is the OP3 better than the Pixel? Besides the price? I could probably understand if you had the OP3T, but no way. My name is…. You are an ignorant. 1) Check the speedtests, 1+3 is faster (because better nand) 2) Software is better on 1+3 (aosp with tiny mods) 3) Pixel has underclocked 821, thus 820 with a little bit of better battery life (1+3 has 1080p screen to tie this up) 4) 1+3 has 6gb ram (will be good for 4 years) 5) 1+3 is smaller than pixels, unbelievably thin 6) 1+3 has dash charging (world leading) 7) 1+3 has half the price 8) 1+3T is another story, far better Apply cream to the burn, son PS Yes Pixel has a better camera. Carson Saldanha Ignorance at it's finest. My name is…. Those are all FACTS, son. My name is…. Where are you, son? Jack Smith Have you ever even used a Pixel? Only Android phone i have used with zero touch lag. Can we also stop the name calling? Mason Andrew Maseda Hate to break it to you man. I own The One Plus 3T the Google Pixel the Nexus 6P and the Moto X pure edition. Lol. Guess witch one is my daily driver? The Pixel. Why? Better battery . Better cam. All around the most reliable phone. Even with my Nexus 6P I've had some issues here and there tiny ones. Like some days my battery life was abnormally shit and the next day it was great. The one plus 3T has tiny issues too. The Pixel is a phone that you wouldn't understand UNLESS YOU TRY ONE FOR A DAY. come back when you do. tansuperman Not sure why people think the pixel takes good pics. I have a pixel xl, 950xl, IPhone 7plus, and now the s8. In my opinion the pixel xl takes the worst pics. The lumia 950xl is stop dog. The pixel I can tell is just too overprocessed Michael Hannigan I think it applies mostly to low light pictures - absolutely nothing touches the Pixel in that respect - trust me. More generally, it applies to the software and hardware working together to create stunning (real) HDR pictures. But in low.light, which according to a friend of mine who is a smartphone camera freak (I am not), quality of low light pictures are what users are primarily interested in because he says "...any recent smartphone can take great pictures in daylight.". For me, I liked the flexibility of the V20 camera - not just the dual lenses, but the absolutely fantastic functions in the camera app. D13H4RD2L1V3 Um, the 821 consumes less power than the 820 at the lower clocks due to a more efficient binning process. Also, both the Pixel and OP3 use UFS 2 controllers. But on Nougat, the 3 uses F2FS for its filesystem. It's not a case of better NAND. It's a case of different filesystems. Michael Hannigan I think they should use FAT16. I miss it. Chris Rey I will say the Axon 7 is just as good as the OnePlus 3 and looks better. Suicide_Note The Pixel camera is definitely superior to what was in the 6P, and i say that as someone who currently owns them both. M. Luciano I use both on a daily basis. Agree with you 100%. So do objective measurements of the cameras. Pixel is the best on the market; 6P is decent but not great. andy_o On paper both cameras should be just short of identical, but the Pixel is so much faster in processing cause of the HVX dedicated core, plus the N6P throttles like crazy (in one of my photospheres tests in a warm room the Nexus 6 beat it every time). This is crucial especially with Google who is prioritizing computational photography probably on par or more with hardware camera specs. Also, I'm not sure if this is a hardware or artificial limitation, but HDR+ auto has completely different behavior on the Pixels. I can understand how someone who has only looked at the specs and not used a Pixel and N6P (especially in the summertime), can think that there's been "no real camera progress", but this guy is balls-deep in the "arrogance of ignorance". Michael Hannigan I think the reason for the difference in HDR+ in the Pixel is that it's" real HDR - it takes several pictures and then layers them. Other phones have taken a shortcut do doing that with one picture and it really doesn't achieve the same. Except in one case - manually setting HDR in my Note 7 gave absolutely stunning night time photos. Something I can't quite achieve with the built in software on the Pixel (but can with Photoshop). andy_o I was talking the difference between HDR+ auto in the Pixel and HDR+ auto in the previous phones. The auto behavior in the Pixel is different, but the HDR+ processing is basically the same. There's more info here: http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/11/21/deep-dive-closer-look-google-pixels-camera/#What_does_HDR_do If you feel nerdy enough I can link you to a paper on HDR+ by the Google computational photography team too :) Regarding the other phone cameras, the reason they do worse isn't exactly that they they're taking shortcuts, it's actually because they're doing it the traditional way, taking different exposures. Read the AP article linked above for details on how HDR+ is fundamentally different. Michael Hannigan You have OLED burn-in? I have about 8 hours SOT/day and don't have any. That would piss me off. Jason B Inverting colors for a bit while doing some extended reading helps. Black background with white text is easier on the eyes too. But yeah, static nav bar and notification area aren't great for OLED. There should be auto pixel shift to prevent it ... or Google should make more use of Immersive Mode. whispy_snippet Ugh. Like a broken fucking record here sometimes. Shawn Spring While some of your other points may/may not be valid, to say that the Pixel had "no real camera progress compared to nexii" just makes you sound ignorant. The S821 ISP alone would make the camera in the Pixel superior, not to mention the updated HDR algorithms. Get a Pixel owner and a 6P owner in the same room (I was both) and ask them to shoot with each others phone and see who prefers which. The 6P camera lag in HDR mode was inefficient at best and unbearable at worst. And it wasn't that long ago that OnePlus was using a broken invite system, had people lick their phones, and had a horribly gender insensitive marketing campaign. I'd probably not hold them up as the standard bearer against Google. Michael Hannigan They had people lick their phones? Why did they never ask me to do that? That's discrimination. I should have been asked to lick my phone. Brett Lewis I love my pixel after coming from a HTC 8x on Windows platform. Never liked Apple and never will. And lately after all the talk of Samsung's products (blowing up, red screens, other problems) I'm quite happy with my pixel. I don't need water proofing I'm not an idiot that takes my phone near water.. the I hardly notice the bezels after coming from a 4.3 inch 720 display.. The htc8x had one of the widest angle front cameras but I dont take selfies. This pixel does what I want and is fast doing it. And for first time experiencing Android I'm quite happy with buying this with the newest and best version available. TheHater So only idiots take their phones near water? I bet if you had a water resistant phone, you'd take it near water. Michael Hannigan What about the toilet? Who doesn't read the news when sitting on the shitter? Mariano Moreira I would definitely agree in terms of the Pixel XL vs iPhone 7 plus comparisons (Non-32GB model) Comparing the base iPhone 7 vs base Pixel...the iPhone 7 base had(has) slow Nand performance from what I have witnessed. The 32GB iPhone 7 vs base 32GB Pixel (5") seems like a closer comparison where the compromise is better battery life on the Pixel, faster Nand, and better screen. Again, I concur that looking at the Pixel XL vs iPhone 7 Plus leans more heavily towards Apple especially when comparing the 128GB models. Michael Hannigan If you buy from the Google store, they are carrier agnostic - absolutely 0 carrier bloatware. Mariano Moreira No. I have a Google Play(Bootloader unlocked) purchased Pixel. Normally used on Sprint or At&t. When I activate on Verizon: to get Vo-LTE calling with Verizon SIM and certain carrier settings it does a software update switching the phone over to the Verizon specific software build. If it was truly Carrier-agnostic it wouldn't force a Carrier specific Software build onto my non-Verizon model Pixel. Michael Hannigan You must have either bought it from Verizon or screwed something up. An unlocked phone doesn't suddenly become carrier specific like you describe Mike John Quincy Adams I don't one person who owns or says ’I sure wish I had a OnePlus.' Michael Hannigan I have - when I had the OnePlus One. Many people asked me about it. You can't deny that OnePlus phones offer an unbeatable value. They don't skimp on specs and sell for half the.price they should. asrat_24 I get you're trying to make fun of that guy but don't make ignorant statements while trying to do it. Oneplus makes good phones and people are interested enough nowadays to say that. Major Sceptic Agree on all points , a mid range device with a flagship price , perhaps Google will adjust the prices on the 2 ? for a company trying to expand it's phone sales it's going a funny way about it . Artem Russakovskii Well, usually at that point you start seeing significant discounts, but the Pixel is a misnomer in that regard to due to low stock and high demand. Max Exactly, I would revise that affirmation to state: "I've always felt once we are less than 6 months from the new iteration, it's a mistake to buy the existing product *at full price*." supersanborn I'll grant there's a case to be made for some phones where waiting can result in substantial discounts (especially from HTC/LG/etc). Probably a little of my bias sneaks in here. I prefer to have the newer device, and if I waited 6 months post-launch, it probably means I myself need to wait until the next launch. Max I'm with you there, I usually buy a phone at launch or a couple of months later at most but remember that we aren't regular customers, that's why we read and comment on this site ;). For many people out there it makes more sense to buy a phone six months after release if it comes with a nice worthy discount. M. Luciano This ^^ supersanborn Agreed, for some, shaving $100-200 off the price is all that matters. I usually caution folk pretty hard in the last 3 months before the new iteration drops if they have any form of new feature/size/color envy. supersanborn And yeah, I'm nowhere near the "normal" consumer :-) needa Supposed to be picking up a 32gb XL (Google) for $450 near mint in a couple hours. I might not get it, but a killer deal nonetheless. M. Luciano Smash that deal :) Very nice. needa A few little scratches on the back glass. Profit.

The lowest I've seen on Swappa was $695 for a black XL. supersanborn True. I usually find that the discounts are kind of on the "meh" side though until we hit release of new product. I always basically tell folks that you either buy it at launch until about 6ish months post-launch, and if you've held off that long, you should just wait until next launch and either buy the old product at a big discount or buy the new one. Matt I believe your use of misnomer was a bit of a misnomer. Artem Russakovskii I did use the wrong word, you're right. el_smurfo That's why I just picked up a 6p last year for $400. Most expensive smartphone I've ever bought, but the full release price was just not in my budget. Karly Johnston Battery issues? MisterAlex Maybe an anomaly... but not a misnomer. paxmos Where is this high demand you guys talk about?, I have yet to see a pixel in anyone's hand M. Luciano Really? I know over a dozen people who have or had them. paxmos Yep...I see lots of iPhones and Sammy's, even one Blackberry Z30, have only seen a pixel in the Verizon store. M. Luciano I feel like a nerd owning 4 Major Sceptic It does seem to have more of an enthusiast following , no shortage of pixels in my region , the usual brands , apple, Samsung, still seem to have the sales , I know not one person that has a pixel or wants one , and I think Google only has itself to blame on that front, Re : the cost of a pixels . Goblin Shark Finally, someone who knows what they're taking about - my head is just shaking in disbelief reading what these marshmallow brains that think they know about phones are saying on this comment thread lol Daishi Exactly. I have yet to see a Pixel in the wild. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ To be fair, HTC isn't used to such a high demand for their phones. Google unfortunately paid the price Daishi This made me LOL! A post full of WIN for sure!! Zoglog Actually it's probably because of all the RMA's they've gotten JD Thought that was obvious. syxbit I wonder whether we shouldn't wait for Pixel + 2. The next Pixel may technically be the first Google made product (current Pixel is made by HTC), so it's possible the Pixel 2 will have first gen problems. Still, I still have the N6P (after I scoffed at the Pixel price and refused to buy it), so I going to be looking for a phone soon. Good_Ole_Pinocchio HTC is also manufacturing the Pixel 2. Word on the street. Daishi That's too bad. I'll avoid this this phone as well... Captain On! Well, technically the iPhone is made by Foxconn, so... Don't expect Google to actually build their own facilities to produce hardware. Carson Saldanha Pretty sure they'll still be using HTC. Might have more control over the design this time around though. 4Ui812 The availability issue is a play out Nintendo's handbook. Good_Ole_Pinocchio 100% agree with the entire article... Do I want the Pixel Software Experience and Camera? Yes... But not when the new version is a few months away thag would probably fix all the issues I see posted on this site ever so often...starting with the Bluetooth issues. I got an S8... Because it's the only phone thay makes sense to me right now..... I'll see what Google is doing in the fall Max Johnson If the Moto G5 Plus had NFC I would have no problem making it my Android daily driver for the next 6 months. wade_county Moto Z Play and OP3/OP3T are other options with NFC. shadowx360 I used to buy 1 generation old Nexus devices to get around the cost issue, but it seems the 5X and 6P both are plagued by serious phone-killing issues. Now that warranty is up on nearly every used 5X/6P, buying used is like trying to navigate a minefield. I don't really trust 1st generation Pixel to not have serious issues either. I'd never use a non-Pixel/Nexus device but I can't buy a Pixel XL knowing Samsung offers so much better hardware at a similar price. wade_county My advice is getting the next OnePlus phone or picking up a used OP3/OP3T. AndrewGM I bought a used Pixel in good shape on eBay, as I couldn't get one from Google Store (already had a wireless provider). Switched from an iPhone 6s, after using almost every iPhone model since and including the original. Much better camera on the Pixel, especially closeups and in low light, and much easier to use overall (especially Contacts vs. iOS), as I've used mostly Google apps for a long time. I like the Google keyboard much better and the Android interface. I'm definitely satisfied with the Pixel and have no real iPhone regrets. It's true there are more apps for the iPhone, but that doesn't matter because the core apps are available on Android too. The only app I miss is Enlight, for photo editing. The one Pixel issue I agree with is the relatively poor resale value vs. iPhones (I assume). Carson Saldanha May I suggest Snapseed for photo editing? (It's developed by Google) Also, do you miss iMessage/FaceTime or is that really a con? AndrewGM Will check out Snapseed, thanks. I've been using Google Photos to lightly edit pics. The Pixel camera is so good that I often don't edit (for Instagram/FB uploads), especially if the light and composition are already good. I don't miss iMessage at all. I had to turn it off and all that stuff for my phone number when I switched, but I'm texting away every day. Emoticons seem to work fine. I don't even think about iMessage. FaceTime has been replaced with Duo for my family members, including those on iPhone. Seems to work fine. And I can share location with family members via Google Maps. I guess that brings up privacy issues vs. using Apple products, but not sure it makes a real-world difference. Battery life, btw, seems pretty good (I charge the phone overnight only). The call quality is a little less than iPhone, maybe, but overall acceptable. AndrewGM Will add that I have had the Pixel for 2 months and use it daily. I like the screen on the Pixel (or at least it never bothers me), and the issue about the "chin" at the bottom being big is a non-issue to me. I don't notice it and in fact hold the phone sometimes there, which is arguably convenient. If the phone continues to hold up, I'll be a customer for Pixel 2 eventually. Eric I was ready to jump to the Pixel XL after returning my second Note 7, but Google never gave me the opportunity to give them my money. Carson Saldanha xD My name is…. It was never a good device. thank you for finally admitting that. Andrew I don't think that's what the author is saying... My name is…. Someone had to be crazy to buy a pixel in the first place. I was bashing on that device from day one. Author, months later, says that the phone is no good. It was never good. Carson Saldanha Lord, would you just chill? Tr3ple I think he's retarded, gotta be it, lol. Must be it actually. Carson Saldanha troll by far Suicide_Note Except that's not at all what the author said, so you're either: A) trolling, B) incredibly dumb, or C) both of the above. Тарас Мукин Of course there's no point in buying Pixel for full price now. And there's more: there's no point in buying any device for it's starting price when it's 3 months old — tech gets old really fast today. And that's the whole point of not buying something at day one — everything gets much cheaper very fast. Samsungs do, LGs too. But Pixel for some reason didn't. And Nexuses were like this too. So — only buying Google devices right after release makes sense. Or buying them unofficially and cheaper. Sad, but true. sraj49 I always like and respect your articles. You put your views straight forward. But I tend not to agree with the tone and content of this article completely. I am living in Home of full Apple products and I own a Pixel XL. I love the Pixel in all aspects. Yes there are room to improvements which is true for everyone. Apple products are well designed, well built. As regards sorry gone are those days when Apple sorry was at is best which was until iPhone 4s/ iPhone 5. Now after the warmth period it is the same as Pixel. I going Pixel after sales support very good. I definitely agree with you on the most inefficient handling of supplies and also this is not the time to buy since meet models are coming. Just to add, I get sick when people say that the Pixel phones are not made by Google but by HTC. Everyone outsources manufacturing. Most of the phone are made by Foxcon staying from Apple. All phone manufacturers only design the hardware, software and the manufacturing is outsourced. Good_Ole_Pinocchio The HTC point that keeps coming up comes from the fact that Google didn't really dsign much hardware hete. They just used HTC parts. It's not the same as hardware being designed by apple then manufactureres elsewhere. andy_o I think he's right on that point. Google support may or may not be good, but it's online only. Apple support is famously good. For instance, the recent fixes for iPhone 6s battery problems. I booked an appointment, went into the store, they told me it would be a bit, went to a coffee shop, they emailed me, picked it up. Another time my iPad mini 2 mute switch broke. Again, appointment, go in the store, got it actually just exchanged on the spot. Google simply cannot do that. JohnyNoLegs What android phones have you owned prior to the pixel? And yes it's a HTC phone through and through. Scofabear Shots fired! I even dumped my 6P for a Moto z play. No regrets Futbolrunner Same here! That 808 was a lag fest. I even got the S8+ but returning it because it can't touch the Play's battery life. Dominic D I just bought a Pixel a month ago. I still would recommend it if you get one for fairly cheaply on swappa. It's awesome. Brian Demodulated My last 3 phones have been Nexus. Each has been less reliable than the last. I love how hackable they are but I think my next phone will be a Samsung Galaxy. Carson Saldanha Elaborate? Wdym by "less reliable" What issues? Brian Demodulated My Samsung Galaxy Nexus was incredible and still works today. My Nexus 5 was garbage - two broke within 1.5 years. My 6P is quirky - it doesn't charge on my home PC and although my wife's updated to 7.1.2 mine says it's up to date at 7.1.1. Tr3ple Get a pixel then, Samsung lol. Brian Demodulated I have my 6P another year. I'll see what's available next year when my contract is up. JohnyNoLegs Bootloops, dodgy updates, requires factory resets, breaks features, slow bug fixes. M. Luciano No offense, but you are not going to increase stability by going to Samsung. Brian Demodulated My old Samsung Galaxy Nexus was the best, highest quality, most reliable phone I ever owned. LG and Huawei's Nexus phones were less stable for me. M. Luciano I had a few of those.. they weren't as reliable. But probably because I did bad things to them. Brian Demodulated I rooted mine, loaded hacky ROMs, and carried it with me everywhere I went for 3 years. The USB and audio cables are a little loose now but otherwise it's saved me when my later Nexus phones crapped out on me. Vitali Galaxy nexus had clean stock rom, it is just Google's clean soft in a Samsung physical device and not with samsung's os Brian Demodulated Every Nexus has the clean stock ROM. It's one of the top reasons why I get them. JohnyNoLegs Going Pixel sure doesn't increase stability. It's less stable than my Note 4/Note 7. Vitali Agree with M. Luciano, but people try should move to Sony. Lookup at speed test videos of their Xperia XZs, it has beaten all smartphones by now, including the Pixel. All the biased big reviewers out there will never tell you the truth, stop thinking the S8 is the best phone in the world.. I recommend you to wait for their Xperia XZ Premium it will have sd835! After you see the XZs speed, I promise you it may be the fastest phone even in 2018. Suicide_Note No. Just...no. Vitali *A wild 8 year old fanboy comment appears* Brian Demodulated Speed isn't that important to me. I've heard bad things about Sony's flavour of Android and that it's bloaty. Vitali So you heard wrong, their software is one of the bests out there, and im talking from experience.. And Samsung have so clean and fast Android that it is just unbelievable.. Where do you get all that info from?? Vitali So you heard wrong, their software is one of the bests out there, and im talking from experience.. And Samsung have so clean and fast Android that it is just unbelievable.. "I've heard.." Where do you get all that info from?? Suicide_Note TW is much better than it used to be, but it's hardly clean and fast. Brian Demodulated I work in a large IT department. One of my buddies told me about it. He said Sony's Android UI was all over the place and annoying to use, and that his handset was 2 major versions behind the latest version of Android OS. dtox Lol don't listen to him, xperia phones are absolute trash. dtox LOL xperia = garbage D13H4RD2L1V3 Um, I'm not entirely sure. Not that I'm ragging Sony, but they haven't exactly been selling for a reason. Even Sony themselves know. I don't hate Sony phones. I personally think they're understated, solid offerings. Problem was that they were really overpriced. After seeing the XZs and XA1, seems like their pricing may have become more logical. We'll see how it goes. I'm personally hoping the XZP may even be a solid device. Not that I'll buy one but if the price is right, it'll be significantly easier to recommend. JSo Experiences differ from person to person. But It's odd the luck you have had with the Nexus devices. I've had the Galaxy Nexus, Nexus 5 and now the Nexus 5X and I have never had an issue with any of them. JohnyNoLegs No battery issues with 5X? My wifes upgraded to 7.1.1 and has never been the same, bluetooth is slow and laggy, and the battery barely gets 1.5-2 hours SOT after it used to get close to 3. Michael Hannigan Dude, you're talking about a crusty old obsolete phone. And unless you are happy getting 2 hours of battery time, you should pry the wallet open and buy something current. Complaining about your old phone won't make you feel better. Replacing it with a working, current phone that's not past it's expected useful life will. JohnyNoLegs Dude, wth are you talking about. It's a 1.5 years old. From new it was getting 4-5, right up until 7.1.1 update. Roy My 6P is the most reliable phone ever. And I had Samsung and HTC. Duder12 The last Nexus phones had bum processors from qc. royrov My Nexus 6P kissed the asphalt a couple of weeks ago, so I bought a perfect Pixel XL second hand (used 3-4 months). Its better, no regrets here. Faster and better battery, hell even snapchat is snappy on it! Tr3ple Exaclty lol, people saying the pixel isn't an upgrade to the 6p are delusional lol. They all like to hate on it u til they get one and realize how good of a phone it is. And all the bugs I've been seeing on the net are nowhere to be found and I had mine for 5-6 months now bekifft I know it's an upgrade. It's just not much of an upgrade for an enormous amount of money. Tr3ple My 6p had serious issues, I went and got a s7 egde(big mistake), the price I paid was well worth it. I'm still financing my s7 egde while I'm using a pixel, this is how much I love this phone. destinyhud I will still buy one Michael Tran If I could give you a phone for free but you had to keep it and use it and couldn't sell it. Which phone would it be? M. Luciano 128 GB Pixel XL, black supersanborn My 128GB Pixel XL in black. At least until the 2 comes and **hopefully** adds waterproofing, 600Mhz support, 4x4MIMO for T-Mobile. If you're reading, Pixel team, let's talk! Orlando aka Pixel XL Samsung Galaxy S8+ blue Tr3ple Gimme a 128 gb pixel XL black any day keithzg The bezels really are due for a shrink. Boy are you gonna rue this when the second-gen comes out and the bezels are the exact same ;) M. Luciano I sorta hope they are :) keithzg You animal! (But honestly, this is why choice is good. I find the desire for those top and bottom bezels incomprehensible, but I can entirely understand that not everyone would feel the way I do, particularly if routinely holding phones very differently.) M. Luciano I just want SOME bezels. They don't need to be huge. Just want a place to put my thumbs when holding it sideways. It's a good place for speakers IMO. Carson Saldanha Nah, to be fair, I think Google's definitely not planning on keeping them the same size if they've listened to the reviews. keithzg I mean, if they'd listened to reviews of many other phones before they put out the Pixels they would have known that too---including, for instance, the previous two generations of Nexus phones . . . So it seems likely that either (a) they know of the opinions of the commentariat and disagree, or (b) they felt technically they couldn't do it. I'm personally hoping it was somehow just (b) but they used (a) to convince themselves that it was an okay sacrifice, but that they won't have to make the same sacrifice again this year and they'll allow themselves to change up the design. But I'm not gonna bet too much money on that. Carson Saldanha Whoa, you lost be there with all those "a's" and "b's" xD Shawn Spring I think its pretty well known at this point that the time frame between when Google's negotiations w/Huawei fell through and when they picked the deal up with HTC was the cause of the "let's use the leftover A9 shells" bezel issue. So more (b) than (a) assuredly. ikeofkc If they do. Peoples' thumb muscles are going to be screwed if they use the pixel 1 handed, constantly trying to reach the back button. The chin makes one handed use possible keithzg See, that's what I mean about different folks and different strokes. I've never noticed it being of any help with my Nexus 6P, for me the top and bottom bezels are completely useless. bekifft If they actually put something useful there, like a front facing stereo speaker, I would be totally fine with that. keithzg Dammit, don't you go making me miss the Nexus 6 again! Michael Hannigan I want them to be bigger. I want to be able to lean on mine when I am standing in line at a movie. MadMartigan I am constantly amazed by the short memories. The author thinks it likely they are likely to have a better launch of P2? They do give the obvious impression that they believe the Pixel to be their first swing and a miss... Funny how quickly we forget, well, nearly every other device Google has ever tried to sell. I personally loved my 4, 10, 5, 6, and 6. But I cannot, while keeping a straight face, argue that one should expect anything better from them regarding inventory management this time around. How many times does Google have to fail on inventory management before we start pointing and laughing at the people who constantly say, "They'll get it right this time, for sure." Don't get me wrong - I would absolutely love it if Google proved me wrong on the P2. I just won't believe it until I see it. //dons flameproof suit// A'ight, I'm ready. Fire away... M. Luciano This is their first swing and a miss, but only because the shortages are for very different reasons than prior devices they sold on behalf of other OEM's. MadMartigan Who...who do you think made the Pixels? M. Luciano Google is the OEM for the Pixel phones (and tablets, and laptops, etc). HTC is the factory putting the phones together. It's a totally different legal and business agreement, and essentially means that Google has to supply most of the components, contracts, contacts, etc. and HTC is essentially an assembly line. On Nexus phones, the OEM was Samsung, or LG or Huawei, etc. and they actually designed and produced the phones, in partnership with and input from Google. Completely different. For those, the partner was able to do all the contracting and sourcing; HTC isn't doing all the work for Google this time. MadMartigan So you don't believe HTC designed the Pixel. Got it. That's all I needed to see. M. Luciano Not sure what that means, but ok. Google is now the OEM, that's what I am saying. Another Scott Nice post. I hemmed and hawed about a Pixel XL 128 for 6 weeks last fall and finally decided I just couldn't do it. Besides the fact that it was impossible to get from Google, I just couldn't justify the price. I decided to finally replace my LG Nexus 4 (roughly $350 new) with a new T-Mobile LG V10 from B&H in November for $330 and am quite pleased. (It would have been $300 a week or so later.) I added a Samsung EVO 128 GB SDHC card for it for $40 or so. I miss the Nexus timely updates a great deal, but I can't see spending a kilobuck on a phone to get it - especially for only a 2 year OS upgrade availability. I hope Google gets the Pixel 2 right, but maybe they figure having a "premium" phone for evangelists is good enough so they won't feel any pressure to make it available (or cut the price). Cheers, Scott. fijisiv The Galaxy S8+ is $20 less than a 128GB Pixel XL Just wow. M. Luciano Right? The Pixel is by far a better value at those prices. 128 GB storage over 16, metal over glass body, better software, better security, better camera, guaranteed to be up to date for 3 years... Samsung has some great components, but as a package, Pixel seems to keep ahead at this point. Matt I believe the S8+ is 64G and has a microSD slot. M. Luciano I think you're right. IMO that makes the Pixel better. Do you prefer less with expandable option? 03grunt I live in the mountains of NC and went back to Verizon once they brought back unlimited data and luckily the local Verizon store had a Pixel XL. I think it's pretty sad that in ~ 18 months the Pixel will be EOL. M. Luciano Luckily, it won't be. Nexus and Pixel devices are guaranteed to be fully up to date for 3 years; not 2. 2 years of major updates and 3 years of security updates = 3 years of being fully up to date. Sir_Brizz That's not entirely true. They are only guaranteed to be on the latest version for 2 years. It's unlikely it will be any different than the Nexus 6 in this regard (which didn't get 7.1 but is still getting monthly security updates). M. Luciano The Pixel and Pixel XL released October 4, 2016. They're guaranteed to be fully up to date until 10/31/2019. That's 1121 days, or 3.07 years. Sir_Brizz No. You are wrong. They are only guaranteed version updates until October 2018. The Nexus 6 was guaranteed the same thing until October 2016. It did not get Android 7.1 even though it continues to get monthly security updates. What this means is that the Pixel will get at least Android 9.0 but that doesn't guarantee it will get 9.1 or 9.2 or anything else past that. It just means it will get 9.0 and monthly security updates to 9.0 for an additional year. M. Luciano I get what you're saying, but it also launches on the latest update. So using the Pixel, it launches with N, will get O after a year, will get P after a year and then is not guaranteed to get Q. Are we really going to get a Q? So during each of those three updates, N, O and P, it on the latest OS and getting monthly security updates. 2 years of updates, so long as it includes the 2nd major OS update, translates to three full years. Ever since they started the annual number and letter update, we're essentially talking about a single API version update per year (2016 had 2, including the one you're referencing which impacted Shamu). Sir_Brizz I've already pointed this out twice: look at the Nexus 6 for a first hand example of how this is going to work. The Nexus 6 will not be on the latest version of Android for three years because it is already not on the latest version of Android despite getting monthly security updates. 03grunt Thanks for clarifying! Chris Kiederer As a Nexus 5X/project Fi user, right now the Pixel is my only choice if my Nexus decides to blow up like many before it. I really hope this Android one rumor heading to the US is true, as it would give project Fi subscribers more than just a really expensive option to stay on the plan Andye82 But exactly one year from today it will be still extremely difficult if not impossible to get your hands on pixel 2 Mix "Persistent stock issues have plagued Google's first "in-house" handset from day one..." I am on my 3rd phone and I still wonder, every time I use it, if it will be like my last two phones. I have phone PTSD! Google should just pull a Nintendo and just stop producing and move on to the 2 but not fuck it up. John Doe Great job on the article, now I will be waiting for the editorial on Google's software update policy LoL PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Google's inexperience producing a smartphone They had great experience running Motorola. Ammar "Sure, Google got some things astoundingly right: the performance, the camera, the larger software experience" To be honest, these are the only reasons why I'd ever get a Pixel over any other Android phone. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ I agree with some of Radar's points as well as teh main one as I've *never* recommended the XL because I know that the vast majority of people are sheep-like followers and/or technophobes, and I defifnitely don't want part of the onus for a technophobe's major purchase that they're going to rue the second that an iPhoner mocks them. The Pixel sells itself to PowerUsers on its own merit, which, AEB the popularity of inferior and/or questionable top-sellers, clearly supports my previous assertions. JPLoureiro Deciphering of your sentences will commence............. now. Futbolrunner What? Marty I never was going to buy an HTC Pixel. Don't like HTC and the build quality doesn't deserve such a high price. jawsnnn My SOs Pixel is probably the buggiest Google phone I have used till date. The Google Assistant, voice search are consistently broken and the phone doesn't offer much else in way of justifying it's price. Will definitely buy an OEM phone next. Google's hardware experiment is dead for me. Tim Harman I wish I'd read this 2 weeks ago! Oh well. I've got a Pixel now and I do love it. I live in NZ and the version I ended up with is the American one, which means that while it supports all my LTE bands, it doesn't support Carrier Aggregation on the bands used here. So that's my excuse for why I simply MUST HAVE the P2 when it's released. Damian Stuart Wow, what a load of crap! The Pixel is a superb phone with issues affecting small numbers of devices. I have one, after moving away from the Samsung range. I have had no issues and as I don't ever intend to take a phone swimming haven't got a single complaint about it. But haters gonna hate. sebastianer @David Ruddock Don't forget the terrible compass. If you grab an iPhone 5S and a Pixel. Open Google Maps in both of them. An you start walking trough dense downtowns the whole day (closing / opening maps at different places). You will see that the Pixel compass accuracy is constantly changing every time you open maps and is a total mess while the 5S is perfectly accurate after 1-2 seconds and less than one step. I hope the next Pixel has a completely new sensor...or compass or whatever. Last 3-4 Google Phones were a mess. I think the last Google phone with more or less good compass was the galaxy nexus but I can't even remember now TechGuy22 i'm selling mine soon since i know i can sell it around 600 dollars and it's the 128GB wjrandon So glad I kept my Nexus 6P for a second year... and look at those rock solid resale values. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9d5926ba5094521287d1d54e2476d3852462178bdf74a16166f94742b435213c.jpg TechGuy22 i sold mine for 500 dollars and i bought it used too lol that's how i managed to get the XL 128GB eric messenger It depends on what phone your coming from. For most android users it is a great phone with a great camera. If your coming from an iPhone the pixel is the first great alternative to an iphone. The on device support is actually awesome and they are very quick with support issues. I am used to Nexus devices plagued with serious issues that you had to work around and while they were great phones for the price I felt they all suffered (maybe not the 6P). Anyway the point is pixel raised the bar for Android and brought it up to par with Apple. It's probably still worth buying if you have to upgrade, and you can just get the pixel 3 in 2019 or 2020. Sean You can say this about any phone at the moment....wait for next gen. As a Project Fi user I am waiting on a phone that has the cell radio to take advantage of T-mobile's new 600mhz band they are quickly rolling out...and NO, it cant be done with a software update on any phone. me me "quickly rolling out"? The spectrum is sold but not available yet as the current user vacates.... Sean NOT TRUE....they are rolling it out in areas NOW where the old TV stations have already vacated the band. Google is your friend. me me finally, you realize it was crap, was always, still now, only thing now is you changed. Never worth the money, specs so-so for the price. Islam Google Pixel poor use of space. over-priced. BS Sean People that actually OWN one dont agree........ TechGuy22 i agree and i have one. sadly, it just stopped caring about the bezel since there's nothing i can do to make it look better VAVAMk_2 6P user here with a new battery happily waiting it out for Pixel 2. Sean Boot loop much? Ernie I have had my Nexus 6p since day one of the release. I have been lucky not to have encountered the boot loop or battery problems others have reported. I love my Nexus 6p. Hope it will get Android O. Phone_Addiction Pixel 2 probably going be the same story. Google will never learn. Dean F Marsh I love my Pixel XL! Invest in a good quality case and enjoy the phone. It's really pretty decent and for a few minor quirks mentioned, and none that I have experience yet, I can't be happier. From Nexus, HTC, Samsung, to Pixel XL, this has been the best so far. Ailín Ó’S I live in Ireland and Pixel isn't even available here yet which is odd given we were a launch country for Nexus 5x/6p but hey ho. Rick Schoonmaker This is just what I like to read after getting banged by Google and Huawei with the 6P bootloop issue 1 year and 2 days (read 2 days out of warranty) after buying and being told that my only option is to buy a new phone. So after being without a phone for a week, I had to buy a Pixel XL even though I really didn't want it and especially at the ridiculous price ($860 for 32Gb.. are you effing kidding?). Matt Definitely. I got a pixel XL the very first morning when it was available in local store. Great phone, camera, software. 2 months later, the phone began to behave crazily--extra hot, microphone malfunction. Called Google support for like 10 times and had it replaced, then I put the brand new replacement on local trade platform without hesitation. Google-brand is attatractive, but does not worth that rediculous amount of money. I can get a even better performed oneplus counterpart for almost half price. Anyway, I am on my moto x 2014 with lineage os 14 and i am pretty happy. It is sufficient for me to deal with my daily work. And I also suggest to wait for the release of more flagships from variant companies to have more flexible and reasonable options. Spinkick Google seems to not be able to follow through on anything these days. It just seems like if its not sexy or cool and needs actual work, they cant be bothered. Maybe they will release another chat app in the meantime.. 2 Men-E I want the Pixel 2 XXL (Taimen). It better exist as a 5.6"+ screened device. Philip Although if you're with TMobile. It's significantly cheaper to buy the Pixel, and get your money's worth. Granted the Pixel is guaranteed two years of support, it matches with TMobile promotion pay credit time. h4rr4r They offer a discount? I thought it was just financing. Philip Yep. $325 in TMobile bill credits over two years. Which is when the Pixel 3 will be out. So you buy a Pixel, get refunded about half of the cost. And then you're ready to upgrade to the third generation. belac77 shhh, David, I just listed my Pixel for sale on Swappa! ;) Mason Andrew Maseda This entire article is just terrible and written by someone just mad they don't have one. M. Luciano lol he got one the week after I did. He's had one. Adrianus Bratanata Supply and demand. As long as there is bigger demand than supply they don't need to reduce the price drunken_bastard I disagree. All the pros you mentioned for the Pixel -- pure Android experience, performence, camera, etc -- those are all the reasons why the Pixel and Pixel XL is still the best smartphone on the market. Worried a new one is going to come out? Happens with every flagship, every year. This one doesn't have the lastest SoC? I challenge you to demonstrate real world differences in actual speed versus the Galaxy S8, which is a gorgeous handset that yet again is crippled by bloated software and long standing issues that never seem to get addressed. You cite support potentially ending in October 2018 for software updates, but that's still a longer window than any other Android flagship, and you get them day one, which Samsung and LG don't. A smartphone is more than the sum of it's parts. It's an experience. I feel on that quality alone, the Pixel and Pixel XL are the best representations to date. NeMoDoSeZ I was going to buy a 128gb Pixel XL but due to not being available I ended up waiting and purchasing a Galaxy S8+. I'm now glad things ended up the way they did because I'm loving my S8+. Rod Until Android 8 is released. Then you'll like: fuck Samsung man! My U$xxx phone is outdated, goddamnit! Owen Iverson I hate the world of tech. We've now gotten used to NEEDING the latest thing IMMEDIATELY. Its why companies like Microsoft, Adobe, and Autodesk have switched to monthly/yearly subscriptions so you have to pay for the rest of your life. "The Bluetooth performance is horrid." What metric, speed? Connectivity? "It's not waterproof." Not sure that waterproof is a common trait among all high-end phones just yet. "The bezels really are due for a shrink." I've never used a bezel-less phone, where do you pick it up or hold it? Does your finger trigger anything on the edges? "The Snapdragon 821 is officially old news." What are you running where 1) you see lag and 2) that it's an actual problem. Maybe people are replacing consoles with their phones just like they're replacing their DSLRs with their phones? "it doesn't support proper advanced network features across all four of the big US carriers." What are these advanced network features? Anyway, I know it's a phone blog, so ... D13H4RD2L1V3 Well, he means that since its successor isn't far off, and that the Pixel is still not easy to get hold of, you might be better off waiting, since the Pixel is also selling at full price still. Edward jh How can the camera be great I mean what about the pixel camera lens flare issue plaguing 1000's of users. Margaritas Ante Porcos Pixel was a disaster. The worst phone for that price. I understand some of you got the Stockholm syndrome. But some of us see the clear picture. Google simply lost this round with both hands down. Dan Yurman My Google Pixel seems to have a mind of its owns. Here's what it does without my asking it - 1. shuts down randomly and has to be restarted by holding the power button and lower end of the volume rocker for about 15 seconds; 2. randomly starts different pieces of software including a suspiciously high frequency of instances of Google Play Music, which I have since disable, 3. Starts the flashlight from the pull down menu if the phone is placed face down on a shiny flat surface, 4 And randomly starts other programs after unlocking the phone with a pin. On the plus side the camera does good work and the phone is easily held in one hand and scrolled with fingers from the same hand while eating hit wings with the other. :-) Ray I'm very glad I read this article. I was on the fence - and almost pulled the trigger the other day but very glad I didn't now. I'll wait for the next gen and hopefully it's a much better piece of kit - and possibly cheaper. lomsha Whaaaat, you don't say. rockon999 My 2015 Moto X PE's display stopped functioning properly and I needed a new device to *function* in my daily life. So I bought a pixel, yesterday. To address your complaints... I never use Bluetooth on a phone, I'm getting a case, I'll hate the speakers (but I really only use headphones), I'm no bezel snob, and finally... waterproofing? My Moto X PE was waterproofed and I can honestly say it never aided me in one single way. Sure, it felt great using the phone in the rain that one time. But I'm fairly certain an encased pixel can survive that. I know it is probably a horrible value, but I really don't want to deal with buying a $200 phone now, selling it later for $100, and then buying a new $900 phone in a few months. I don't have time to constantly be reselling and selling my devices and I don't have a spare $100 to just throw around on a device. Slurms Mckenzie Seriously have been saying most of what this article is about since day one. I have a pixel XL and I've hated it since receiving it. It's not worth what Google asks when everything that is offered can be had for half the money (quick updates not included) for that asking price it should at least offer sd card support which is something even the most basic phones have. I've been using Nexus phones since the beginning (skipped the 6) and the problems with them were expected as it was a budget friendly phone but if you want to charge premium pricing don't use cloth for your ear piece cover, have dual speakers, and for God's sake don't make deals with the devil (Verizon) to lock down MIMO as a carrier specific feature when every damn phone is capable of and and most carriers are as well F*** you Pixel XL you sack of shit what a waste of 800 bucks Rod Best camera Google photos unlimited backup at original resolution Best performance Lowest touch latency of all Android phones "Just" that. micahthomas Basically all you're saying is wait if a new version is going to be released in 6 months. Might as well just say that, doesn't really have anything to do with if it's iPhone or Android. JG I was about to order my mother a 32GB Pixel a week or so ago to replace her Nexus 5X. I recently discovered the glass of its camera lens has a pretty decent crack in it. It doesn't seem to affect pictures - yet... But we're planning a fairly photogenic trip this summer and I figured the Pixel has a better camera and has unlimited free full resolution Google Photos uploads so... But as I was about to click the "Add to Cart" button, I thought we're not all that far from the expected October release of the Pixel 2. I'm sure mom wouldn't mind being a generation behind, but... derk p just replace the housing on hers. i bought a white one but then wanted a blue back... was cheap on ebay and is very easy to snap on and snap off dizel123 Relatively speaking we're not too far from October of next year for the Pixel 3. Or October 2019 for the Pixel 4... toast I never buy Apple, and I never buy Samsung. But both of their hardware just feel slicker than the Pixel. As the article says, knock a few hundred off the price, and I'd be a keen buyer, mainly for the camera and fast OS updates, and Google "Purity". I'll wait and see how the upcoming Moto Z and X phones turn out. Defenestratus It'll be difficult for me to go back to a Google phone after the nightmare that was my 6P. Major Sceptic Availability is no problem in my neck of the woods , and I appreciate the work Google did on the camera as a point and shoot and smooth software , but after looking at the pixels they looked a bit underwhelming in the feature department , and then as mentioned the outrageous​ prices for the pixels I wouldn't go near one . I might add with the smooth software , Google no longer has the Monopoly on as most devices with 7.0 onwards are very good . Rod What feature does it miss? redsoxwin I'm not sure what this person's agenda is, but this is great phone. Strange article. Amie Perry Porter I personally love my Pixel phone. Will Dutton I never cease to be amazed that everyone always thinks that 'the next one will fix it' with android John Quincy Adams Whining about bezels is ignorance. Without bezels, how do you hold it? . ..please, bezel whiners...answer this... gar216 I'm a happy Nexus 6p user. Even prior to launch I couldn't justify upgrading my 7 month old 6p to a Pixel XL. It would have clearly been an upgrade, but I didn't think it was enough of an upgrade for the price. Also... It's kinda ugly. SiliconAddic "The Google Pixel is a notoriously hard phone to get a hold of. Persistent stock issues have plagued Google's first "in-house" handset from day one, and things really are little to no better in the six months since the launch event. " Um BS. Google has ALWAYS his issues with distribution. The Nexus 5 had this issue, the Nexus 6 had this problem, the 6p also had this problem and now the pixel. Google is incompetent when it comes to this. Meanwhile Apple can launch a new phone and you can walk into any of their stores and pick one up. I wanted a Pixel to replace my Nexus 6, could not get one. I ended up with a S7 edge. Google and Nintendo should team up with their inability to ship jack ****. Eric How does this stand to affect the resale value / trade-in value for current pixel owners under project fi? I'm asking as someone who switched to project fi from Verizon prepaid in early January, and has almost been regretting it ever since. I am a quadriplegic in a power wheelchair to whom the pixel with Google Assistant seemed a natural front runner, due to its voice capabilities, and project fi with it's much touted multi Network and Wi-Fi hopping capabilities seemed a good decision as well. Did my due dilligence and the 4G network to all appearances covered me completely, even though I live with my elderly parents in a rural area. The only option available for order at the time was a white Pixel (not XL) and 32gb. I was nervous about the 32 part at the time, but felt comfortable with the infinite backup capability of Google photos. Now, 3 1/2 months later, not only is service spotty, audio crackly despite not being a candidate for replacement under the microphone bug, and Google's customer service... Let us politely say not the most helpful on the issue. I apologize about the length of this comment, (and after reading over it I really should have made it a direct message) but the difference between a phone worth $600 and the phone worth $300 in retail/tradein is quite a big deal to someone like me, and as much as I love my pixel (and admire/fear/respect Google) getting out while the getting is good is starting to sound the smarter move. ( especially after the 180 they made on the 5x.... Grrrrr) Was curious to get an educated opinion on the subject. Thanks again for your ( and anyone else's who has read this far) time and any insight offered! dizel123 Opinion: Even if you can, you probably shouldn't read David Ruddock's articles anymore. Adam Myself having been using the Pixel since day one, I would agree to an extent... Would I go out a purchase a brand new Pixel/Pixel XL for full retail? Of course not! Only because the new iteration is just around the corner. Now, would I go buy a Galaxy S8 or an iPhone 7? No way, wouldn't even consider it! I have switched phones at least every 6 months for the past 3 to 4 years, between Android and iOS operating systems as well... Having said that, the Pixel has been the best phone and best experience that I have had to date! This is the first time that I haven't thought about what phone I want to get next, and to be honest there would have to be significant improvements for me to even get the newest iteration when it comes out this fall. This phone as just been that good. To sum things up... I would not buy the Pixel/Pixel XL right now at full retail cost, I definitely would NOT go out and buy a Galaxy S8 or an iPhone either... If you, like myself, really love the Pixel line and want to get one and don't already own one. I would suggest trying to hold out and get the newest release this fall. It's most definitely worth the wait! D13H4RD2L1V3 Google always seems to have issues with stocking ever since the Nexus days. Pretty embarrassing that it's still hard to get a hold of one after 6 months. Probably due for a small price cut soon, as newer phones roll out. me me yeah I loved Nexus back with Nexus 4, 5, 7. Now the Nexus banner is carried by the likes of Moto G, OnePlus.... H2OSKI So true. The bluetooth issues alone nearly make this phone unusable. Drops and cutout's every 20 seconds. Get this, my Pixel was fine UNTIL Google sent out "the server side" update to fix the Bluetooth issues my phone never had!!! Thanks Google. Mine is going back this week. Great camera crap bluetooth. I take pics occasionally​ but I need to use a bluetooth headset hours a day. Multiple headphones, headsets, and vehicle connections with all the same result...even in safe mode. Fail. Daishi Google shot themselves in the foot when they gussied up an HTC 10 and called it a Pixel. It is just any other Android phone and doesn't have the support behind it to justify the price. Six months along, it should be more than 50% off. William Ross Why the hell is this idiot comparing a 6 month old device to the newer releases? A year in smartphone years is a lifetime. That being said, the pixel still has the best most up to date software bar none! The camera is still among the best if not the best. And, although the 835 is a newer processor, the 821 is no slouch. GTFOH with this garbage article. And, I'll definitely be getting the next Pixel regardless of price. And, I'll sell my original on eBay for a pretty penny. And, this baby has no scratches any where. It's always been in a case and all glass has been protected by Liquid Armor. diggie Pixel is a $650+ phone built like a budget chinese phone. And sorry, Oneplus has Google beat on OS features while keeping "stock" feel. William Ross Oh here we go again with the one plus fans always hating on the pixel. If your phone is so great then why knock the pixel? I just don't get it. Just talk about how great your actual Chinese knockoff is. No need to hate in the Pixel. The one plus has little more than a cult following and mock my words, it'll never be a mainstream device. me me Android Police and a lot of its customers are hating the Pixel. The OnePlus fans just chime in. I own a OP3T. It simply works, yep even Bluetooth. When take tax into account, its about half the price. OnePlus fans biggest concern: price creep upwards. $300 becomes $350 becomes $390 becomes.... Goblin Shark Is this article from April 1st? Absolutely no one with any knowledge of phone tech recommended a Pixel, ever! Underspeced and overpriced, I doubt there's any trouble keeping them in stock they just know nobody wants them so they're not making any. Rod Under-spec'ed? Ok Underperforming? Nope Edgar Morales I honestly don't see what the problem is I purchased my pixel XL and have not to date had any issues whatsoever with it no Bluetooth issues no speaker issues nothing everyone is saying Michael Hannigan Hey, if you get a phone you love and it lasts just under a year, that's good enough. What more do you expect for a few hundred bucks. Appreciate the year you loved that thing and then replace it with a new one that you can love even more. Tom Takumi Okamoto OnePlus is a better phone maker than Google. A company not even 1% worth of Google. I really want a Pixel but it's not practical. Ionut Lala I'm sorry but that is clearly not a first generation device. Not the first from Google (made by HTC and let's not forget about the Nexus line). And not the first from HTC (for obvious reasons). Aquan Belk I wish other Android manufacturers went to stock Android. I know Samsung shines in it's own apps on top of Android but vanilla Android still is and always will be the best. Rod You heard the man, people. Don't buy a Pixel because it will have bad resale value and won't be updated for long. Instead, get a model that will have bad resale value and won't be updated for long, plus has worst performance, buggy software and worse camera performance. You're welcome. Stephonz My last Google phone was Nexus 5. As much as I like pure Android experience, Google has a bigheaded trend in phones. The price point was my biggest no no after the 5X. They don't offer as much features as the other well known Android companies.. amir80 I have a Pixel 32 gb and I really really like it. Everything works great and the camera is amazing and also the battey life. For me, the fingerprint sensor is a must. The S8 sensor is poorly located and the G6 sensor is too small. GeorgeDao123 Absolutely. The Pixel duo are 2 pieces of $#!¶. They run pure Android version and they are so slow to boot up and open apps though they are lag-free. Neru Nexus I've had a pixel since launch day. For one I don't agree with the bluetooth issues. Keep the phone up to date or use the bluetooth connect and play app to automate things. Second it is a over priced phone but so is an iPhone. The main reason real users should get a pixel is the updates. Sure you might need to learn something about that expensive piece of tech you bought and not just sit on your hands waiting for the apples or googles of the world to update your shit, but at least google gave us source code, kernel code and a unlocked bootloader. There are still updates being made for the old nexus 5, that's like 5 years old. Grab iphone 4s and tell me again about how fucking great those updates are lol. You can't even install apps like skype or whatsapp that thing is pooched. I can promise the world that even if google stops updating the pixel in 2018 there will be updated versions of the os you can manually install for years. Let's see if you can get more then one firmware update on your fancy new samsung s8. My money is on 1, then the s9 will launch a year later and samsung just won't care about the s8. rjcuk What if you want a slightly smaller phone? The S8 is 5.8" compared to the Pixel at 5". I really struggle to hold 6" phones. Even the Nexus 5X at 5.2" was too big to grip properly and comfortably. Janoo Ramachandran DON'T BUY A PIXEL. We have 2 Pixels at home. One bought early November 16 and the other end Jan 17. The one I was gifted this January, within 40 days had microphone related issues. I could not hear anyone on the phone, nor was the music being played out. They refused a replacement. My phone sat in the repair centre for 8 plus day and the mother board replaced. Have you ever heard of a new phone device of any other brand needing a mother board replacement in leads than 45 days WELL GOOGLE PHONE PIXEL NEEDED IT. The other phone bought early November 16 started having other issues last month and it wasn't recognizing the wifi. After at least 20 hours on the phone with the terrible google support, it had to be sent to the repair centre where it was kept for 2 weeks, you heard that right 16 days to be precise. Then the phone came back with a chip replaced. SHOULD YOI BUY A PIXEL EVER. :. NEVER SHOULD YOU LOOK AT GOOGLE AS A PHONE MAKER :. NEVER Nikhil I wholeheartedly concur here. I picked up a Pixel sometime around December which had to be promptly returned for a replacement as the volume rocker was rickety. The replacement didn't last long either. Within a month, the widely acknowledged microphone issues popped up and after almost 15 days of talking to the very incompetent Google support in India, their only resolution was to take the Pixel to the service center. The service center did not have the motherboard in stock (they had to bring it all the way from Taiwan) and my phone still languishes there even after 15 days of me submitting it. The phone suffers from not only just Gen-one product issues, but also terrible after sales support. Leonardo Baez Agree.... ait for the next generation THEN buy current generation cheaper. Jeremy Allan Actual customer service? You do realize that owners of a pixel get free 24/7 support any time, on a dedicated line for pixel owners? Exalm There is the same section in the settings on Nexus 5X and 6P. No idea whether it works, since there's no chat or phone support in Russia neither for Nexus nor Pixel. Cory Wilson I agree. Granted it was around a year ago I bought my 6p but the 6p didn't cost $870 either. Still don't regret that decision Impulse_Vigil Haven't really had any serious Pixel Bluetooth issues here... A handful of times (literally less than half a dozen) BT shut itself off back in Feb-March, hasn't happened again since the Play Services patch. I use Bluetooth on a daily 24/7 basis too with my ZenWatch 3, car audio, etc. I don't push it to its range limits tho. Dunno whether David's usage and issue is some sorta edge case, or range related, or whether he was speaking to the 1-2 month period when others were having more severe Bluetooth shut off issues. I do agree with the overall sentiment tho, Google hasn't made it easy to buy the Pixel and that's simply inexcusable. I haven't had to suffer thru any of the QC issues (no BT, mic, whatever issues here, knock on wood) but it seems they weren't handled super well either. To be honest I wouldn't even recommend the S8 to anyone either unless it's another geek/enthusiast, these days for most people it's simply not worth it to spend that kind dosh on a phone. I bought my mother a Moto Z Play; I'd probably point others towards that, the OP3, or an HTC One/S7 on sale. I'm super happy with my Pixel, but if there was a OnePlus 3-class device for Zoglog Having owned a pixel XL and now a s8+, I'd have to agree. Even not taking into account the questionable hardware reliability of the pixel (mine died in 5 months). Basically when I owned the pixel I loved the hell out of stock Android but I kept on wondering why I paid so much for it. Meanwhile with the S8+ the gorgeous screen makes it feel especially special and worth the price. Even though I would prefer stock Android 10000% sebastianer Pixel is just another Nexus. Like the 6P. There is no excuse, this is not their first premium phone. Still made by HTC instead of Huawei. And called Pixel instead of Nexus...and more expensive because of HTC and all the marketing costs. And..still has the shitty compass all their recent previous nexus had with a lot of topics open in Google product forums and staff giving tons of manuals about how to perfect calibrate something that doesn't retain calibration. But the main reason I wouldn't buy a Pixel...is the compass and secondly that you will get one more android update if you wait 6 months. username_not_valid How is the pixel the first 'in-house Google phone'? Its clearly and actually a slightly rehashed HTC. HTC doesn't just make it ,they designed it for all intents and purposes. Unless Googles design strategy happens to be exactly like HTCs then its not a Google phone. The Pixel is just an over priced nexus, nothing else. SOUL- Always great to see the smartphone community go from praising a phone to outright basing it just after a couple of months. Perfectly fine with my Pixel. Michael Sørensen It's just ... really boring. andy mckenzie It's a superb phone , blazing fast so processor is not an issue , amazing camera , free storage , online support has been fast and efficient in my experience, stock Android , I'd highly recommend to anyone. remister I am still using my 6P, I couldn't swallow the 1K price tag for 128GB with insurance.... Justin Field Yeah, I broke the screen on my 5x, and since I am on Fi I considered getting a pixel for about 2 seconds and ordered and new screen and fixed my phone. I will wait for the next gen or switch off of Fi.

Aiding in the latter’s development, Google announced today that the AR platform will soon be natively integrated with the Unity game engine. Nintendo Switch Google unveiled the news at Unity’s Vision AR/VR Summit this morning and follows Daydream adding native support last month. While it is already possible to develop Tango applications in Unity, native support allows for a simpler development process and improved performance. When Unity added native support for Daydream, performance and latency were better optimized and allowed for deeper access to hardware. According to Nathan Martz, a PM on Google’s Developer Platforms team, the native support is “going to make Tango AR development for smartphones just as accessible and powerful as Daydream VR is today.” The integration will arrive in version 2017.2 of Unity later this year.

Google released some of the scheduled activities happening at the annual developer conference this May 17 to 19 so you can start planning which events to go to. But Google points out that they haven’t released information on all sessions and want to keep some a surprise until the opening keynote on May 17th (which starts at 10 a.m. Pacific time). Aside from that, Google will be letting attendees reserve seats for some of the sessions ahead of time. But they also intend to leave a few seats open for those who want to attend at last minute. Google has increased the size of each tent to accommodate more people, too. The tech company also plans to double the number of Office Hours to give developers more time to talk with Google team members. And this year, the sandbox demo is moved inside climate-controlled structures to help keep people cool and dry for these events.

Phone leaker Sonny Dickson tweeted Thursday that the device, which would run using the company’s voice assistant Siri and its AirPlay functionality, would use the Siri voice assistant and AirPlay functionality.  Read: Apple smart speaker in the works? He further said that the device would use the company’s Beats Audio technology and will run on iOS. While Apple is still mum on the device’s existence, let alone its features, there are chances that the company could launch the device at the World Wide Developers Conference in June in San Francisco. Here are five expected specs of the device: Facial recognition tech: According to CNET, the device might have a built-in camera like the Amazon Echo Look to detect multiple users. Voice-based smart speakers such as Amazon Echo and Google Home have a problem doing so and sometimes get confused between voices. A built-in camera would help the speakers respond to both visual and audio input, which means differentiating between users will be much easier.    Beats Audio: Apple’s devices have generally received good feedback for their audio and the company has its own wireless earphones, AirPods, which it sells separately for $159. So, its eventual move towards speakers is not unexpected. The company is expected to employ Beats Audio technology in the speaker, which could have a concave Mac Pro-like design with audio and other controls at the concave top. Beats Audio is the name for signature noise-cancelling technology that Apple uses in its devices to provide its users with clear audio. For the speaker, it might involve the use of components such as high-grade plastic and insulated wires to ensure clear audio. Touchscreen: Unlike Google and Amazon’s devices, Apple is not just making a smart speaker that responds to your voice, but one that is iOS-based. This means that the device will have a touchscreen, which would give you access to multiple apps at once. Say, for example you use the Nike+ running app. You might be able to get the speaker to simply put out your running targets and tell you how far you are from your goal by connecting to the app. Improved Siri: Apple has been expected to have an improved version of Siri for some time to match up with the evolving functionality of the Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa, apart from other artificial intelligence based voice assistants such as Cortana. The company could probably unveil an improved version of Siri, which would be designed to support the smart speaker. Read: Apple’s Self Driving Car In The Works? Smart home functionality: The essential reason behind Apple designing a smart speaker is its goal of creating a smart Home, something CEO Tim Cook has indicated many times in the past. The Apple smart speaker is expected to be compatible with its HomeKit framework for communicating and controlling connected devices.        Related Articles What Are Sheeple?

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Google Releases May 2017 Android Security Updates For Pixel & Nexus Devices, Direct Links for Factory Images & OTA files By Zara Ali 11 hours ago 17Shares Share Tweet Submit A few weeks ago, some Google Pixel and Nexus devices accidentally received the May security patch. Today, the Android 7.1.2 OTA update is being rolled out officially for all the devices. This update brings minor bug fixes and many security patches. It is worth noting that the Canadian carrier Rogers’ Pixel and Pixel XL devices are only getting the security patches instead of the full-fledged update. These devices are no more getting their particular builds. However, for Deutsche Telekom and Verizon are getting their own builds with this update. Related These Experimental Nighttime Photos Clicked with Nexus 6P and Pixel Are Nothing Less Than Spectacular In the bulletin, Google notes that it has “brought two security patch level strings to provide Android partners with the flexibility to more quickly fix a subset of vulnerabilities that are similar across all Android devices.” Almost all the vulnerabilities for the month of May have been addressed in the single OTA released for Google devices, today. Advertisement The tech giant also notes that while Google devices will get the single OTA update, other manufacturers will be getting OEM-specific fixes, which means that the updates will be according to the particular devices by the manufacturer. Vulnerabilities handled in the OTA update are segmented into two levels – Moderate and High. The most lethal of all the vulnerabilities was the one that allowed remote code execution while browsing. This issues was executed by hacker via modes like email and MMS. Although there have been no user reports regarding such issue, but Google has fixed it to seal every breach in the security.

No way, I'm totally serious. This afternoon I spent like four or five minutes researching Wikipedia and like two other links and found the very best that North Korean game engineering has to offer. Granted, there aren't that many games yet, but after they crush the imperialists hopefully they'll have a little more free time. Some of these games are NSFW, so if you're under 65 years old, please ask your creator.  Let's do this -- the very best North Korean-made video games, evar! You are logged out. Login | Sign up     10. Pyongyang Racer!  I mean, look at it. It's exactly like Forza Horizon 3 but in downtown North Korea. Baller. The game may look unfinished to you, but if you Google "are the streets empty in North Korea" you'll find that the game is far more realistic than you gave it credit for. It's probably because with the exception of Mercedes-Benz driving government officials the average person cannot afford gasoline, much less a car. Awesome.  Um... Well, this is awkward. It looks like North Korea only made that one game, ever. Don't they know Unity is free? (The irony of that statement though!) Seriously?  Now what? Oh wait, here's a ton of video games set in North Korea, but all of them were made by Americans and they lose the war in all of them. That's not nice. Bad! I did find some furry propaganda. Wait, that's not it. Focus, Niero.  Welp. Time to resort to browser games. Jackpot! I found some fucked up site with a ton of them. Yes! And we can play them online!   We're back, baby! Hmm, Google Translate won't translate these stylized fonts.   I'll just have to improvise the game titles.   Here we go: #9 - Bejeweled IV: Cover the eyes of ill-shaven Showa Salary Men who dig holes and peek at me with the boulder-sized rubies earned by selling sex slaves to Russia shhhhhh It's a typical day in North Korea: There are Japanese guys sneaking into your garden (<3 Bill Wurtz) with five o-clock shadows, so you must move your gems over their holes so they can't peek into your garden anymore. If you touch the wall with your gem it's game over. Bad! Garden tools are hard to come by, but you can skip levels on the right. Press the first button to get the game going. Play it here. #8 - North Korea flies into glittery Florida in space: Kindness Quiz Challenge  How well do you know North Korea? Just try answering more than like two questions right without Google Translate, I dare ya! Unless you're already half Korean or something, that's cheating. This one is kind of a snore, but nobody dies and losing only results in bouncy noises, which is what I hope happens when they fire their untested warhead into Japan, ending the motherland of video games unless seven old helicopters stop them. Play it if you must. #7 - Project H.A.M.M.E.R. Did you know that voting is mandatory in North Korea, but there's only one name on the ballot? You can cross that name out but people will follow you home and kill you.  But more importantly, you can press the number keys here to crush his skull and dreams. Play it here. #6 - Mass Effect: Hamgyongbuk-do  You can't save everyone, or stab everyone that jumps over the demilitarized zone. But you can try. #5 - Poor Infrastructure Fighter II: Cancelled Visa Warriors Two childhood friends beat themselves to death for the last grain of rice in their barren wasteland of concrete and statues. It's just like being there! Play it here. #4 - Pretty fucking cool train derailment  This game is probably the most fun of the bunch: You have to quickly build connecting tracks before the train arrives, but the tiles are generated with the worst possible curves. You can't get new pieces until you play one of the three track tiles given. There's cool propaganda posters in rotation on the right to fill your spirits as your country's logistical nightmare sends its unsuspecting citizens into a sudden death. Prophetic! Play it. Ok, now we're getting to the final countdown! It's gonna get hot!   #3 - Giant man baby lost his keys and blames capitalist rats This one's so awesome that it gets two screenshots, plus it's starring North Korean Link again! This charming puzzle game fills my heart with memories of our little yard in the Socialist country where I grew up, where we didn't even have running water in the outhouse bathroom (and had to boil it over gas in the kitchen if we wanted drinkable or even just basic warm water) -- and we were probably living in luxury compared to North Koreans. But I digress.   In this spiritual successor to The Wind Waker, you're in a maze full of Asian-faced rats and you've gotta recover some keys and exit safely. The best thing -- you have a wooden stick and can beat the rats to death. There's also fiery dicks and a watering can. I'm sure there's a metaphor there somewhere but I've been holding my piss for like an hour and can't concentrate. Play it. #2 - Oh! That's who the other Asian guy is, so let's hang him This one is really fucked up. You hang a politician and over. Why? Why not!  I feel really sad for whomever made all this infantile bullshit.  And the #1 North Korean-made game is.... #1 - George Bush and Shinzo Abe and that other Asian guy again: Fly Swatter Ultimate Death Squish of Lies and timid skull structures in Bloody Bucket Overcast Afternoon Crank your speakers up for this one, it has realistic gnat sounds. Look at how realistic the wing of the dead prime minister of Japan looks against the very thin and shabby bucket! Next gen. Play it here. Wow. We made it.    That's all I got.  Are those games seriously made by North Koreans? Yes, I honestly think so. They're all hosted by a pro-North Korean newspaper. I couldn't find more games, so I'll have to finish this article after the next revolution. Unless I'm killed at the airport LOL.

Featuresby Dane O'Leary10 hours ago 41 412 19 The fact that smartphones are essentially pocket-sized computers has never been more apparent than it is today. Take the latest iPhone or Galaxy out of your pocket and try to think of something that the device can’t do: Web browsing? That’s old news. Mobile applications? Got those in spades. Cameras of such a high quality that standalone point-and-shoots are all but obsolete? You betcha. High-definition portable media consumption? Check. Wireless printing? Assuming anybody ever needs to print anything on actual paper these days, yes, that’s here, too. And the list goes on and on. With such accouterments now a standard part of the smartphone experience, it’s easy to forget that it wasn’t very long ago that the smartphone was just coming into its own. Mobile web-browsing was a standout feature and a smartphone display’s pixel-per-inch count could barely even conceive of crossing into the triple digits. But the smartphone has grown, evolved, matured. The current lineup of smartphones have biometric security with fingerprint- and iris-scanning. Plus, we’ve seen that mobile phones could conceivably double as a replacement for your desktop computer (re: Samsung’s DeX and projects like the Superbook). Although I’ve made no contribution to the advancement of smartphones or mobile technology, the tech-lover in me is quite proud to see that the smartphone has become a burgeoning industry. To honor the prominent place that this technology now holds, for better or worse, in our hearts and daily lives, let’s take a moment to look back on the Android phones that predicted the future, one feature at a time. What’s interesting is many of the most lasting features actually debuted in phones that were less than runaway hits at the time. Dell Streak and big screens Dell was never a big name in the Android world, and today doesn’t even offer smartphones. Despite this, Dell actually was among the first to truly embrace big screens with the Dell Streak 5. At the time, the 5-inch display was considered absolutely massive. Of course, back then, bezels were much thicker than they are on today’s devices. Dell never hit it big with the Streak 5, but it seemingly inspired plenty of other smartphone makers to aim for bigger screens, including Samsung with its original Galaxy Note.  The Galaxy Note is essentially credited for making bigger phones more popular, but it was Dell that truly dived in first. It’s interesting to think just how much screen size has changed, with a large chunk of mainstream phones these days easily hitting 5.5-inches or larger. LeTV Le 1 and USB Type-C Wired interfacing with smartphones has always been done via USB OTG (which stands for “on the go”). In the Android world, wired interfacing with smartphones was almost always done via the micro-USB connector, which is still seen on phones today (albeit less and less frequently). While some might say it was limitations in data and power transmission, arguably the biggest issue with micro-USB was that it had to be inserted in a specific orientation; if you tried to insert a upsidedown micro-USB connector into the corresponding micro-USB port of an Android smartphone, it was like trying to force a square peg into a round hole. No dice. In the late summer of 2014, USB Type C was unveiled. This next-generation USB OTG connector was both reversible (hallelujah!) and could transfer data much faster than previous generations. Both Apple and Google quickly began to adopt the technology with Apple’s MacBook and Google’s Pixel tablet line donning USB Type-C ports. However, the designation of “first smartphone to ever have USB Type-C” goes to the LeTV Le 1, released in the spring of 2015. Of course, there would be numerous others to follow soon thereafter, including the Huawei-made Google Nexus 6P and 5X. Fast-forward to 2017 and USB Type-C is very nearly the universal standard among smartphones. HTC One M8 and dual rear cameras Mainstream consumers who are less dialed-in when it comes to tech may not be familiar with the Honor brand, but a number of us might reflexively attribute the first dual-camera setup on a smartphone to the Honor 6 Plus; however, that’s not exactly true. Before the Honor 6 Plus was released at the tail end of 2014, HTC released the One M8 with its dual rear-facing cameras in March. Although the HTC renaissance hadn’t yet started with the HTC 10, the One M8 was a very well-received device. It was a strong performer in terms of processing power, had an admirable display, and the ever-popular front-facing BoomSound speakers were present. Ironically, it was the device’s camera performance that many found lacking. The purpose of the extra sensor was to feed additional depth data to the primary camera, which would, in theory, result in a better and more crisp photo. Unfortunately, the primary camera wasn’t all that great to begin with; dynamic range was poor and all but the best-lit conditions were difficult environments in which to shoot. Fortunately, the fate of the dual cameras didn’t actually rest on the performance of the One M8 in the photography department as we’re beginning to see dual-camera smartphones released regularly from many of the industry’s biggest players. Vivo Xplay 3S and QHD display   Remember when HD (720p) was the pinnacle of smartphone display technology? Nowadays, it’s 1440p QHD that is all but standard when it comes to mobile displays, resulting in more and more consumers scoffing at 1080p FHD. However, it wasn’t all that long ago when 1080p was as good at is got. We owe the genesis of our obsession with pixel count to the Vivo Xplay 3S. First unveiled in late 2013, the Vivo Xplay 3S featured a six-inch display with 2560×1440 resolution; in other words, it was a 2K display. At the time, it had been just a year since 1080p display technology began appearing on smartphones, but Vivo was keen on giving us another big push into the future. In hindsight, display quality was the perfect smartphone feature with which to innovate, especially since many of us use our smartphones quite extensively for mobile media consumption. Today, flagship-level smartphones almost always feature 1440p QHD displays, which have even begun to appear on mid-range, “budget flagships”. HTC Droid DNA and wireless charging Even though we take them for granted today, smartphones still feel a lot like a futuristic, Jetsons-like form of technology, and they continue to get more and more advanced. At this stage in the game, many of us are dreaming of a world where our pocket-sized computers are can interface with the internet and other devices while never being tethered by any wires. We’re nowhere near that world yet, but we’ve taken some steps in that direction with things like Bluetooth and wireless charging. The first Android smartphone to sport wireless charging was the HTC Droid DNA; coincidentally, it was also the first Verizon smartphone with a 1080p display, but that’s beside the point. Released in December of 2012, the Droid DNA featured a non-removable 2020 mAh battery, which is puny by today’s standards, and built-in Qi wireless inductive charging. It goes without saying that wireless charging has quite taken off in the same way that 1440p displays and USB Type-C have, but there is a growing roster of smartphones that support Qi charging, whether built-in or via an add-on accessory. The main issues with wireless charging is that it’s slower and it basically means being unable to use your phone while it charges since the phone has to be making contact with the charging pad to receive power; however, as Samsung’s wireless fast-charging pods have proven, this technology is still improving and will only continue to grow as we move forward. LG G6 and 18:9+ aspect ratio You’ve probably noticed a major trend in smartphones, which is that they’re getting bigger and bigger and bigger. Back in the flip-phone days, we wanted small and slim, but with video streaming and media consumption being a top function of today’s smartphones, we need all the screen real estate we can get. It’s getting to the point where we don’t really hear the term “phablet” anymore because virtually all smartphones feature 5.5-inch displays or larger. The problem with smartphones continuing to grow in size is that they’re becoming unwieldy, and that’s where the new aspect ratio comes in. Until the LG G6, the aspect ratio of virtually all smartphones was 16:9, which is the same aspect ratio of computer monitors, most laptop displays, and even our high-definition televisions. Basically, the 16:9 aspect ratio means that the rectangular display is 16 units across and 9 units high. The G6 was notable because it launched with an aspect ratio of 18:9 (or 2:1), meaning that it’s twice as long as it is wide. In short, this aspect ratio allows you to put a bigger display on a smartphone while either maintaining its width or possible even decreasing it. Since it’s a smartphone’s width that determines whether it can be used single-handedly, the 18:9 aspect ratio means we can have a smartphone with a larger display without it feeling like a larger phone. Seeing the 18:9 aspect ratio on the LG G6 was odd at first, but Samsung’s Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus have just launched with an 18.5:9 aspect ratio; in other words, the S8 devices’ displays are slightly more than twice as long than they are wide. With two of the biggest smartphone manufacturers in the world making smartphones with an 18+:9 aspect ratio, it’s safe to assume we’ll be seeing this on many more to come.

Google has released a new software development kit that you can use to build-your-own hardware with Google Assistant baked in. If you aren’t a developer, the more exciting news is that the SDK will make it possible for other people and companies to add Google Assistant to their hardware, much as they can already do with Amazon’s Alexa voice service. The Google Assistant SDK includes sample code and instructions, and it’s designed to work with the Raspberry Pi 3 or similar hardware, which means you can sort of build your own Google Home with a $35 mini-computer by plugging in any mic and speakers you already have lying around. Sure, it won’t be as pretty (and might not be a good at picking up your voice from across a room) and Google’s $129 speaker (which is currently on sale for $114), but it could be a lot cheaper… and it’s certainly a lot geekier.   Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply Be the First to Comment!

Google and other household names encouraged the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to enact the rules in 2015. But now with the regulations on the chopping block, those companies believe the change will have little effect on their bottom line and are trying not to get dragged in. They could face pressure, though, from consumer groups and net neutrality advocates, who see them as crucial allies to saving the rules. ADVERTISEMENT Republican FCC Chairman Ajit Pai is moving to roll back the rules, which allowed his agency to regulate internet service providers like public utilities and forced broadband companies to treat all web traffic equally. His plan would hand oversight over to the Federal Trade Commission and allow companies to voluntarily promise to uphold net neutrality principles. Democrats, consumer groups and many groups representing internet companies quickly blasted his plan and are vowing to mobilize the public to save the rules. But many Silicon Valley giants, including Facebook and Twitter, which once backed the rules, are now publicly silent. Officials at several major tech companies said net neutrality isn't a priority anymore. Many of the companies that were once forceful advocates of the rules no longer think they will be harmed under repeal. Facebook, Google and Microsoft boast market valuations in the hundreds of billions, giving them new power relative to broadband providers. Consumer groups and smaller internet companies worry that if net neutrality goes, broadband providers could offer faster internet speeds to companies that pay up and slow down those do not. Such an environment could favor established companies with deep pockets, making it easier for Google and Facebook to reach customers over upstarts. Facebook is already pushing for so-called zero-rating, or data-free plans, for its app. Those plans let customers access certain apps or sites without counting against their data plans. The plans are expected to multiply if net neutrality goes. Critics worry free data plans help larger players who can cut deals with broadband providers to favor their apps and make it harder for rival content providers to break through. For many, Netflix, which now has a market cap of $67 billion, highlights the quiet shift on net neutrality among big internet companies. It was once a vocal advocate for the rules. In 2014, Netflix vowed to mobilize its customers against broadband providers after a court struck down an earlier version of the FCC's rules. “Were this draconian scenario to unfold with some [internet service provider]," Netflix wrote in a shareholder letter to investors, "we would vigorously protest and encourage our members to demand the open internet they are paying their ISP to deliver." That same year, the company tore into an FCC net neutrality plan that would have allowed broadband providers to create fast lanes for companies willing to pay more money to guarantee faster speeds to their content. "No rules would be better than rules legalizing discrimination on the internet," Netflix wrote in a comment on the rules. Today, while Netflix still officially backs net neutrality, it doesn't think repeal will hurt its business. "Weakening of US net neutrality laws, should that occur, is unlikely to materially affect our domestic margins or service quality because we are now popular enough with consumers to keep our relationships with ISPs stable," Netflix wrote in a letter to shareholders earlier in the year. Google in 2014 also spoke strongly in favor of net neutrality. “No Internet access provider should block or degrade Internet traffic, nor should they sell ‘fast lanes’ that prioritize some Internet services over others,” the company said at the time. This year, Google has been mostly silent on the issue publicly. A trade group, the Internet Association, has been more active than many of its members, such as are Amazon, Facebook, Twitter and Google. The association has met privately with Pai and also publicly urged him to keep the rules. The companies are quietly watching and cautiously trying to influence the debate, though. Lobbying disclosure reports from the first fiscal quarter of 2017 revealed that Facebook, Twitter and Microsoft have all spent money to lobby on net neutrality. Executives from Facebook, Cisco, Oracle and Intel, among others, have also spoken with Pai on net neutrality. One tech expert said it is still early in the fight, and many companies may be biding their time. “[The FCC] just made the announcement,” said Doug Brake, policy analyst at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a Washington, D.C., think tank. “As a legal and policy matter it’s all pretty delicate," he added. "To be able to choose their words carefully and navigate the PR process is not easy, so why not wait?” But the repeal push is moving quickly. If Pai’s proposal is approved for consideration at the FCC’s open meeting in May, the agency will begin seeking public comments on rolling back net neutrality. Four million people filed comments in support when the FCC began the process of enacting the rules. And net neutrality's defenders are vowing a similar all-out public blitz. Advocacy groups publicly say they are hopeful major internet companies will eventually speak out to help save the rules. But privately they admit fears that tech won’t step up to bat as in the past. A senior staffer at one advocacy group said they are divided over whether to even try pressuring tech firms to help save net neutrality. “Whether or not to pursue the companies is a question currently being hotly debated by pro net neutrality activists. The problem is that the big tech companies are fickle champions,” the staffer said. “Sure, Google or Facebook may not have made it big without net neutrality, but now they are big.” Some say they should target smaller web companies, those they believe would be most likely hurt if net neutrality is scrapped. “This is not about Netflix vs. Comcast," said the staffer.   View the discussion thread.

People Press Releases Home / Technology / R&B Singer Ne-Yo Invests $2.3 Million Into Tech School R&B Singer Ne-Yo Invests $2.3 Million Into Tech School By Sheriden Chanel on May 1, 2017@IndieByline Tweet Pin It R&B singer/songwriter/producer Ne-Yo is now adding tech advocate to his plate of business endeavors. The Las Vegas native has stepped up to the plate in a time when his efforts truly matter most, as we see the dire need for diversity in tech-related fields. It is an action that joins the ranks of Google’s announcement of the opening of their Howard West Campus. With news that top tech companies like Uber and Facebook and even Google have a lack of diversity in their recent grad hires, Ne-Yo’s recent move to invest $2.3 million in the Holberton School is a major one. An engineer himself, Ne-Yo understands the plight of growing up black and perhaps not having the right opportunities open up to you to show you the possibilities of tech paths. As Ne-Yo told Business Insider, being an engineer “is not a realistic career for people who came up like me. It’s more realistic to do what I do, be a singer or an NBA star.” The Holberton School is a coding school where students learn how to code with no upfront cost. Students there exchange paying a traditional tuition with giving the school 17% of their salary for three years once they get their first job post-grad. What also makes them different from other coding schools out there is that their programs are intensive and extensive. In fact, students must attend class for up to two years. In terms of diversity, their current class is made up of 40% women and 53% people of color. Per Tech Crunch, Ne-Yo told the publication, “I just love the fact of what they’re doing with the school. They’re making it easier for underrepresented people in the world of tech. They’re giving them a platform and access to this knowledge that they probably wouldn’t get otherwise.” He went on to add: “Tech is changing by the second, so it makes sense to get the people that live in the world to be part of this thing that’s changing it, as opposed to just this one group of people.” Photo Credit: PR Photos Sheriden Chanel is a twenty-something writer, Beyoncé enthusiast, and lover of all things visual art.

As usual, accompanying the update is a new security bulletin over at the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) that details the vulnerabilities Google worked to address with this latest patch. According to the company, the most severe of the patched vulnerabilities was a bug that would have allowed malicious hackers to gain remote access to an Android device. Google says it has had no reports of anyone exploiting that vulnerability before it was patched. The update is available in both factory image and OTA forms. Instructions on how to flash your Nexus or Pixel device can be found on Google’s developer website. Alternatively, MobileSyrup has a more in-depth guide on how to flash factory images here.

New Atlas Lifestyle Science Technology Transport Search Subscribe Mobile Technology Siri, Bixby, Google Assistant: Why are smartphone makers banking so heavily on AI and voice control? Emily Ferron May 1, 2017 AI assistants aren't an overwhelming selling point for smartphones, but industry giants have big plans for them  View gallery - 4 images Why are Apple, Samsung and Google marketing AI assistants so earnestly? They're not just battling for phone sales. They're also battling to control your entire consumer technology ecosystem. Assistants are certainly helping to sell phones, but perhaps not to the extent that one might think based on media attention and heavy shilling from their makers. The marketing intelligence group Fluent recently conducted a survey which reported that 23-percent of consumers are loyal to a particular assistant, but 50-percent – more than twice as many users – indicated that they don't care if their phone has an assistant at all. Sick of Ads? More than 700 New Atlas Plus subscribers read our newsletter and website without ads. Join them for just US$19 a year.More Information Of the respondents, 29-percent of iPhone owners and 25-percent of Samsung owners profess to be AI-loyal, but considering that the leading virtual assistants are very similarly capable, we wonder if customers are simply transferring brand loyalty to their preferred maker's AI (rather than vice versa). Siri made waves at its introduction in iOS 5 and the iPhone 4S, prompting competitors like Google and Samsung to respond with their own versions of voice control. Most recently, Google made an effort to bill its Pixel phones as the first to ship with Google Assistant, and Samsung's Bixby made a marquee debut in the Galaxy S8 series. However, those two hotly marketed "new" technologies seemed to be nothing more than 2.0 versions of Google Now and S Voice, respectively. Google Now introduced some new assistant features thanks to its integration with Google's predictive algorithms and the user's Gmail account, but otherwise has not been dramatically upgraded. S Voice did not represent any major innovation, and while it's been gradually improving over the last five years, the eponymous Siri has made only a few major advances since launch. Samsung talks Bixby at its Galaxy S8 series launch event (Credit: Wil Shanklin/New Atlas) In the same Fluent survey, 33-percent of users did not care about the introduction of Bixby at all while 37-percent admitted to being completely unaware of it. These folks probably don't care that the Galaxy S8 and S8+ launched without full Bixby capabilities (there's still no voice control), but the significant fraction (26-percent) of Samsung smartphone users that reported positive feelings about Bixby stand to be disappointed with the half-baked feature set at launch. If that's the case, why launch Bixby at all? It's mostly because Samsung and other smartphone makers are prioritizing the long game over of-the-moment capabilities, if recent releases, conversations and rumors are any indication. They're not just trying to make it easier to use your phone with your voice. They are also looking to trounce Alexa and Amazon Echo, the current leading AI-driven smart home assistant and hub. Samsung, for instance, made no secret for its ambitions with Bixby. Samsung wants to someday integrate Bixby voice control into pretty much everything from phones and computers to home appliances. Google Home, competitor to Amazon Echo Google has not spoken as explicitly as Samsung, but the recently launched Google Home with Google Assistant are the only direct competitors to the Amazon Echo/Alexa at the moment. Not only did Google make an effort to give Google Assistant extra publicity by re-naming it and launching it with the first made-by-Google smartphones, it also rolled out the Assistant to all recent Android phones. Evidently it is more important to Google that the Assistant catches on than that it fuels smartphone sales. There are also strong rumors that Apple will announce a high-end competitor to Amazon Echo in the near future. According to credible reports from industry analyst Ming-Chi Kuo via 9to5Mac, the forthcoming Siri speaker is shaping up to be Apple's attempt to get its foot in the smart home door, and supposedly has about a 50-percent chance of being launched at WWDC in June. There doesn't seem to be a question of if Apple will launch this product, there only seems to be a question of when. So while there might be some degree of-follow-the-leader happening here, the tech industry's big leaders aren't necessarily opting into the AI assistant trend based on a case of the me-toos. As AI gets smarter, it's poised to dramatically alter the realities of our everyday computing platforms. Google, Apple, Samsung and Amazon are all battling for market share in the emerging IoT, wearables and smart home spaces. Amazon Echo (Credit: Will Shanklin/New Atlas) Will virtual assistants catch on as much as these companies hope? Well, as connected smart devices continue to gain footholds, it will be a natural progression for AI and IoT to grow alongside one another. But success will also rely on AI assistant technologies passing a certain utility threshold. Right now, smartphone assistants are largely useful at times when you require hands-free operation or only need to complete very simple tasks. Otherwise, it is usually quicker and easier (and, in social settings, less awkward) to navigate your smartphone with the taps, swipes and presses with which we have grown so familiar. While AI assistants are steadily improving, they're still quite limited. The experimental bots and chatbots of today need to push us toward the conversational and adaptive assistants and algorithms of tomorrow.

The retail giant said over the weekend that it plans to stop supporting its Underground Actually Free program, which debuted in 2015. At the time, Amazon pitched the program as a way for app developers to make money while giving away their software for free via Amazon’s online app store. Under the program, participating developers could make their apps available through Amazon's app store, and Amazon (amzn) would pay those developers royalties based on the number of minutes people used their free apps. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. In order to have qualified, developers needed to already have a non-free mobile app available on either Google's (goog) Play store or Apple's (aapl) app store, and ensured that their apps would work on “at least one non-Amazon mobile device"—and not just Amazon devices like Fire tablets. The idea was to reward developers for building compelling apps while convincing consumers to download their apps from Amazon’s app store instead of through rivals like Google or Apple. Amazon’s hope was that consumers would be lured to its app store because some apps there would be free. Some of the apps available from the program included popular mobile video games like Goat Simulator, Sonic Dash, and Castle of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse. These apps normally cost money to download via competing app stores. Amazon did not say why it was discontinuing the program, but it seems that it didn’t catch on with enough consumers. Additionally, Amazon is debuting similar programs in which it pays developers to build apps, or skills, that improve the company’s Alexa digital assistant that people can speak with to do things like play music or order food. The retail giant could be shifting its resources to attract more outside coders who specialize in building software for Alexa, which the company is betting will be the future of how people interact with their devices—whether using phones or Amazon’s Internet-connected Echo speaker. For more about Amazon, watch: On May 31, developers will no longer be able to submit their apps to Amazon for approval to the Underground Actually Free program. Additionally, Amazon said that people will no longer be able to download free apps that are part of the program to their Android devices starting in the summer, but they could still download free apps if they currently own a Fire tablet. Fire tablet owners will be able to download any of the currently available free apps until the end of 2019, when Amazon plans to end the program.

Google says that all of the vulnerabilities disclosed in its latest bulletin were revealed to its partners on April 3, 2017 or earlier. There are two separate security patch level strings in the new bulletin "to provide Android partners with the flexibility to more quickly fix a subset of vulnerabilities that are similar across all Android devices", Google explained. However, it also pointed out that "supported Google devices will receive a single OTA update with the May 05, 2017 security patch level". These are the latest build numbers for each supported Nexus and Pixel device still eligible for security updates: Nexus 5X: N2G47O Nexus 6: N6F27C Nexus 6P: N2G47O Nexus 9 (Wi-Fi and LTE): N4F27B Nexus Player: N2G47R Pixel / Pixel XL: N2G47O Pixel / Pixel XL (Deutsche Telekom): N2G47T Pixel / Pixel XL (Verizon): NHG47L Pixel C: N2G47O The latest OTA binary image files for supported Nexus and Pixel devices can be found here on Google's site, and the new factory images are available here. By the way, some Pixel XL owners received this update a couple of weeks ago, after Google accidentally pushed it to some of those handsets, marked as "CONFIDENTIAL INTERNAL ONLY".

While he isn't CEO of the parent company, much of Alphabet's success has come under his tenure, and his division generated the largest share of revenue and net income by far.  Pichai presided over a big surge in first-quarter earnings, which were $7.73 per share. That was far higher than analysts' consensus. Over the past 12 month, the company's stock is up almost 30 percent. Most of Pichai's pay last year was in stock awards, totaling over $198 million. He made an annual  salary of $650,000. His 2016 compensation represents a doubling of his 2015 pay.  Play Video CBS This Morning "How Google Works" authors on how Alphabet works Google has grown dramatically in recent years, with revenue soaring to $90 billion in 2016. Leaders restructured under a parent company called Al... Last year, he outearned his bosses, Alphabet CEO Larry Page and President Sergey Brin, who each earn $1 per year. Page and Brin, the company's founders, have been getting just a dollar for several years -- they own the most stock in Alphabet. Other top earners at Alphabet last year were Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat, at $39 million, and the board's executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, who served as the company's head executive from 2001 to 2011. Schmidt earned $4.3 million.  The Google division handles search, YouTube and the Android operating system. Along with Google, Alphabet has businesses like Calico, its biotechnology endeavor, and the "moonshot" efforts such as Nest and Google Fiber. Each unit has its own CEO.   According to executive-pay tracking firm Equilar, the compensation record over the last 10 years was set by Tim Cook, when he became CEO of Apple (AAPL) in 2011 and earned around $380 million, predominantly in stock awards. (Equilar didn't compile numbers before then.) That chart-busting package came as Cook took over from founder Steve Jobs shortly before Jobs' death. All financial reports are not in yet for 2016, but Equilar spokesman Dan Marcec said he "would not be surprised" to see Pichai stay at the pay peak for last year.  In 2015, Dara Khosrowshahi of travel booking site Expedia (EXPE) had the highest pay among CEOs of publicly traded companies, at $94.6 million. For this year thus far, Equilar found Thomas Rutledge of cable operator Charter Communications (CHTR) is the best-paid CEO, at more than $98 million.   With more reports still to come, average compensation for CEOs in 2016 was $16.6 million, up from $15.5 million the previous year.

Apps iOS Apps Mac Apps Accessories Tips Jailbreaking Jailbreak Tweaks How to Jailbreak Unlock Devices iPhone iPad Mac Apple Watch Apple TV Deals Latest Deals Google Maps, Amazon, eBay and other iPhone apps quietly ditch support for Apple Watch Christian Zibreg on May 1, 2017 15 A few major iPhone apps have recently removed support for watchOS from their iOS updates submitted to App Store, including Google Maps, Amazon and eBay. As first noted by AppleInsider, retailer Target also removed Apple Watch support from one of its recent updates although the company still offer watchOS integration with its Cartwheel app. The Google Maps, eBay and Amazon apps all removed support for watchOS without any mention in the official App Store release notes accompanying these downloads. The companies did not say if support for watchOS was ditched permanently or temporarily. The move could indicate that watchOS features in these apps were not widely used. Google brought Maps to Apple Watch in September 2015. eBay and Amazon updated their respective iPhone app with watchOS compatibility in 2015. I can confirm these apps have indeed dropped watchOS support because they’re no longer found in the list of compatible apps inside the companion Watch app on my iPhone. It’s especially annoying that Google Maps no longer offers a native watchOS app as it’s made following turn-by-turn directions a lot easier with related wrist notifications. If you manage to spot other examples of Apple Watch apps being removed from iOS updates, let us know in the comment section below and we’ll add them to the list. Tagged: Amazon Apple Apple Watch Apps eBay Google Maps News watchOS MORE FROM iDB Siri for Apple Watch is about to get much more useful Facebook SDK for Swift beta now available to iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS developers watchOS 3 preview: new watch faces on your wrist & Face Gallery on iPhone Ds Very interesting considering Google Maps was just updated for Android wear over the weekend. nova12 I use all those apps on my iPhone but never used their Watch versions. There are only a handful of non stock apps I use on my watch (chamberlain garage door opener and spark, basically). And I’ve always used Apple maps for directions. For me, the watch’s utility is in mirroring notifications to my wrist and tracking health metrics, not as a standalone mini-iPhone. so I’m not all that bummed about amazon or eBay or most other apps. Rowan09 Couldn’t agree more. When I was selling on eBay it was convenient with the eBay app, but I’m not anymore so it doesn’t matter. whodakat This isn’t a good move for Google. First off, I use my AW every day but readily admit that 3rd party apps basically blow. There are a few apps out there that do work great, but on the whole, not so much a selling point of the watch. I don’t use Google Maps, but the point remains the same, I do actually use the turn by turn directions on the watch, so if you used Google Maps and many people do, you’d loose parity with Apple Map users, and no one likes that. Their intent may be to get AW users to dump the AW for Wear, but I don’t see that happening IMO. As for Amazon and eBay, what could either of them do on a watch screen other than send me notifications? Is someone out there shopping on their AW? brian. For Google at least, the maps app was crippled by design. It doesn’t have turn by turn or anything really that useful. People didn’t use it because there really wasn’t much to use. Lui Tune In Radio (and Pro) Cerberus The Wise As someone who has tried their watchOS apps, I’m not all that surprised. These apps were borderline useless and I just removed them from my watch since I couldn’t imagine them being useful in any situation I could imagine. My guess is that they’re failed attempts that didn’t live up to expectations and have probably gone back to the drawing board for the time being. A good WatchOS app should have some more functionality beside just mirroring iPhone notifications. Blip dude Funny, I get those apps were just mirroring iPhone notifications but after being an owner of one for the past 6 months I’m still trying to figure out what the hype behind smartwatches really is. Sure it’s useful but I feel like if I was to get rid of it I wouldn’t be missing out on much, besides the fact that people assume I have a huge disposable income for owning a smart watch (hint: I really don’t). nova12 I don’t think it’s indispensable at all. I think it’s a “luxury” item that provides a bit of extra utility that probably isn’t justified by its price. Like, you can get by just fine with regular light bulbs, but if you shell out some extra cash, Hue bulbs will give you some extra convenience. Totally not necessary, but nice to have if you can afford it. So yeah, basically what you said at the end. Rowan09 Well when I was training for FDNY it was very useful for my runs, for times, etc. Everything is about convenience and since I work in construction it’s easier to look at my watch at a text or missed call instead of taking out my phone all the time. It’s useful for some but not necessary for a lot of people. Jerry It is extremely useful at my job. When I’m at work I set up all the alert news and weather straight to my wrist without me having to take my phone out of my pocket put the passcode in and go in the app. MadeInNY Can you guys point me to an article that let’s me know when an app gets Apple watch support? I’m not sure how useful it is to know I can’t do something. What I really need is to know what I can do. Swanny246 > It’s especially annoying that Google Maps no longer offers a native watchOS app as it’s made following turn-by-turn directions a lot easier with related wrist notifications. Errrr did we use the same Apple Watch app? The Google Maps watchOS app was just a static list of directions that highlighted the current direction. No notifications, no wrist taps. Not necessarily Google’s fault as watchOS 2 was incredibly restrictive, but it was useless. MacServiceGuy always fun to watch fan boys/girls get angry at anyone but apple. ok – here you go, i’ll make this simple: supply and demand. it’s called capitalism. do you really think amazon, ebay and google would stop supplying something that had demand? i’ll make it even simpler for apple fans who refuse to tell themselves the truth: 1. sometimes apple has dumb ideas for products 2. a $300 watch is a dumb idea it’s that simple the problem is: it’s a significant pet project for apple and removing it now would make tim cook look like the dolt he actually is burge As is obvious that you didn’t read what was in the post so I’ll tell you. It has nothing todo with Apple if these companies remove a feature from the Apple Watch and no one is angry at Apple in fact no one has posted a angry comment on this thread. Is the watch over priced, yes probably but it sells out on release date so what does that say.

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media     Google CEO Sundar Pichai’s pay doubled to $199.7 million in 2016 By George Avalos / May 1, 2017 at 10:54 AM Alphabet doubled down on Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google, paying him twice as much in 2016 as in 2015 through a whopping pay package of nearly $200 million that vaults him into the top ranks of the nation’s highly paid executives. Pichai harvested $199.7 million in executive pay during 2016, which was nearly double the $100.6 million the CEO made the year before , according to a regulatory filing. “It would not be surprising if Pichai is in fact the public company executive with the highest pay package this year,” said Dan Marcec, director of content with Redwood City-based Equilar, which tracks executive compensation and compiles an array of data. The highest pay package for CEOs nationwide in recent years, according to Equilar, was a behemoth total direct pay award of $378 million that Apple bestowed in 2011 on its new CEO at the time, Tim Cook. CEOs often capture mammoth pay packages the first year they take over the reins. Pichai’s total direct compensation was fueled primarily by a stock option package valued at an eye-popping $198.7 million, the Securities and Exchange Commission filing shows. Mountain View-based Google’s co-founders, Alphabet CEO Larry Page and Alphabet President Sergey Brin, each received their customary $1 in total direct compensation, unchanged from 2015, according to the SEC documents. Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Alphabet, and a former CEO of Google, captured a pay package of $4.3 million during 2016, which was down 46.4 percent from 2015. Schmidt’s decline in pay was primarily due to his not receiving a bonus. Ruth Porat, chief financial officer of Google, corralled a pay package of $39.1 million in 2016, a 25.8 percent jump from the prior year. Like Pichai, a hefty jump in her package of stock options drove her total pay higher. David Drummond, chief legal officer, received $664,000 in total pay, a 1.3 percent decrease that was due mainly to a slight decline in his salary. Among the perks for Pichai: His “other compensation” included $322,241 for personal security and $38,561 for personal use of aircraft provided by Google. Despite the pay decrease, Schmidt likely won’t have to tighten his belt. That’s because Schmidt grabbed a windfall profit from the sale of previously granted stock options. Pichai, Porat and Drummond also sold stock and realized big gains. Pichai realized a windfall of $180.1 million in gains through the sale of stock. Stock sales produced gains of $32.8 million for Schmidt, $32.7 million for Drummond and $23.7 million for Porat, the SEC files show. “When you have a new CEO, especially one who was promoted internally, you will see them get large stock awards in the first couple of years,” Marcec said. “You want to ensure they are invested in the company, that their decisions are tied to shareholder value, that they have skin in the game.”   Photo: Sundar Pichai during a conference during the 2015 Mobile World Congress.

Sarah K. White (CIO (US)) 01 May, 2017 22:08 - - - - print email Comments IDG The Samsung Galaxy S8 has redefined smartphones -- it's all curves, no bezels and truly one of a kind. Samsung needed to create a device that would make everyone forget about the Note 7's exploding batteries and it accomplished that. The S8 and S8+ are two of the best smartphones on the market. They aren't perfect, but Samsung came close. What might be most exciting about the latest Galaxy flagships is that Samsung has made smartphones fun again. Smartphone design has grown tired, with every device featuring some version of a flat, bezeled display. Samsung was the first to get to the table with a innovative bezel-free design, and you can expect smartphone design to follow. The Galaxy S8 is an Android device that finally values form just as much as function, something Apple figured out over a decade ago. The Galaxy S8 is a sleek, high-end device, and it's predicted that it will gain more traction in the enterprise than past Android devices. Galaxy S8 design The Galaxy S8 is beautifully designed with smooth, curved edges that complement the tapered OLED Infinity Display. It feels just as premium as it looks -- no plastic in sight with a body coated in Gorilla Glass 5. The design looks like it could be fragile, but I've dropped my own S8 more than once, with a slim case, and it's held up. I remember thinking the same about the iPhone 4 -- every new smartphone feels fragile until you're used it for a few months. The display took over the physical home button, and instead Samsung included a pressure sensitive button beneath the display. I like the haptic feedback. It's not like the Apple iPhone 7, where it feels like you're pushing the actual display in. But it's better than your standard vibrating feedback, you feel like you can give it a decent push even when the display is asleep. Of course, one of the biggest complaints about the home button is that Samsung didn't integrate a fingerprint scanner into the display. Instead, the fingerprint button is on the back of the device, next to the camera. This results in smudging the camera as you awkwardly reach around to find the scanner. I went in with low expectations of the fingerprint reader, and I've mostly relied on other authentication methods. But after more than a week of use, I've gotten used to it. I always keep a case on my devices, and the cut out for the camera makes it easier to blindly feel for the reader. Overall, I don't think it's a deal breaker, but it will ultimately be your personal preference. Sometimes a new phone also means building new muscle memory, and after two weeks with the S8, I have no problem reaching my pointer finger up to the fingerprint scanner. Just like past devices, the Galaxy S8 is IP68 water and dust resistant, with wireless charging and a 3.5mm headphone jack -- Samsung also included a USB Type-C charging port. The rear-facing dual-pixel camera is 12-megapixels -- same as the Galaxy Note 7 -- but the front-facing camera has been upgraded to a wide-angled lens with 8-megapixels. Although the rear-facing camera is the same as last year's, Samsung has boosted software performance for higher-quality images. The camera works fantastic in low lighting and, as with all Samsung cameras, images feature a slight boost in contrast. Whether you like the boost in contrast and saturation is personal preference, but I found images sharp, clear and vibrant. [ Related story: Enterprise showdown: 5 ways the iPhone beats the Galaxy S8 ] Galaxy S8 Bixby button This is technically part of the design, but the Bixby button deserves a section all to itself because it's also the worst part of the design. It was a bold move for Samsung to include a dedicated button for its new voice assistant, Bixby. It's especially bold when you consider Bixby is brand new, no one has ever used it before and most Android users are loyal to Google's voice assistant. Initially, Samsung said the button would be remappable to another assistant or app -- which I was happy about. I use Siri and Google Assistant to do one thing -- set timers. A dedicated Bixby button felt excessive when I'm only going to use it to avoid forgetting laundry in my apartment's shared washers. Samsung decided to remove the ability to remap the Bixby button. Not only is that change disheartening, the physical location of the Bixby button is frustrating -- it's exactly where you'd expect to find your volume down button. The app is useless in its current state. I couldn't even ask it to set a timer if I wanted to. There's one silver lining to the Bixby button, depending on how much of an optimist you are. After my husband received his pre-order, he discovered at least one use for the Bixby button. If you delete every card and app from the Bixby screen, it becomes so glaringly bright white that you can use it as a flashlight. If Samsung wants users to be loyal to Bixby, it needs to make the app so good that no one will want to remap the button. Customers don't spend over $700 on a smartphone just to be pushed into using any feature. This one feels like a clumsy nod to Apple's strategy, with Samsung slowly trying to entrench people into its ecosystem -- the exact thing most Android users are trying to avoid. [ Related story: Samsung targets the enterprise with Galaxy S8 and S8+ ] Galaxy S8 display The 5.8-inch OLED display on the Galaxy S8 speaks for itself -- it's gorgeous, with a stunning resolution of 570 ppi. Not only is it unique, but the rounded edges of the Infinity Display create an immersive experience. Whether you're reading an article, watching a YouTube video or playing a mobile game, the edges of the device just melt away. The curved edges are also practical.Tthe S8 looks large, but it doesn't feel that way when you hold it. I've found the iPhone 7 Plus, Pixel XL and past Galaxy flagship devices too wide for my hand, but the Galaxy S8 is the perfect size, even with a case. The 18.5:9 aspect ratio is a little odd at first, but apps that aren't already optimized for the new ratio can be "cropped to fit," including YouTube videos. And with the growing trend of bezel-free displays, it's easy to imagine the S8's odd ratio will soon be common-place. Another advantage to the tall display -- especially for business users -- is how effective it is for multitasking. You can float apps on the display in bubbles, quickly opening them to use a fully-functional, but scaled down version of one app without leaving another. On smaller displays, multi-window features always felt gimmicky rather than practical. But the S8's tall display makes Android's multi-window function useful. I never had to switch out of another app to answer a text or browse my playlists like I did on my iPhone. Galaxy S8 performance If you purchase the device in the U.S., you'll get a Galaxy S8 with a Samsung Exynos processor. Outside of the U.S., the device features Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 processor. It comes equipped with 4GB of RAM and I found the combination of Samsung's processor and RAM perfect for regular use. The device ships with 64GB of on-board storage, and it's expandable up to 256GB with a MicroSD card. It's tempting to compare performance of the Galaxy S8 to the iPhone 7 Plus -- and for good reason. They're two of the best devices you can currently buy. I think the iPhone will always come out on top when pushed to the limit -- for example, uploading or downloading large files. Apple has fine-tuned its lightweight mobile OS to run seamlessly on its own hardware using a proprietary processing chip. Alternatively, Android has a lot more manufacturers and devices to please. That is, it needs to work across multiple devices, run widgets, allow for multi-window mode, support launchers and ROMs and offer users high-level customization. When you consider all the things an Android device asks of its OS compared to an iPhone with iOS, the performance of the S8 is extra impressive. Coming from an iPhone 6, I expected a choppier performance on Android. But with the S8, it's been a seamless experience. I haven't experienced any lag or poor animations; performance has been smooth and snappy. Galaxy S8 battery life It's no surprise that Samsung played it safe with the S8's battery. The S8's 3,000mAh battery is smaller than the battery in the Galaxy S7 edge, but Samsung claims it has a longer lifespan, losing only 5 percent of its capacity over two years. I can't test this claim without a time machine, but if it holds true, that's exciting news. In daily, average use, the battery is enough -- it's not great, but it's enough. Of course, it's going to depend on your settings, apps and general habits, and I find that in my first month with a new device I use it more often than I normally would. Over the past two weeks, I've pushed the S8 to the limits. I've loaded the device up with well-known battery drainers like Snapchat and Facebook Messenger. I kept Bluetooth on all day and used the S8 as my main streaming device for YouTube and Spotify. With heavy use, the battery got me through an entire workday, with a recharge in the evening. On days with lighter, more typical use -- days when I went out and reached for my smartphone less -- the battery got me through the day, well into the evening. The device charges insanely fast with Samsung's fast charge technology. It will display the amount of time you have until a full charge, which is useful if you're trying to get out the door. The fast charging made up for the average battery performance since I could quickly top the battery off. I expect that once the honeymoon phase wears off I'll have no problem stretching the battery life further. But if battery life is truly important to you, you might want to look at the S8+, which has a 3,500mAh battery. Bloatware While Bixby's execution was a misstep, one area where Samsung finally got it right is with its proprietary preloaded software. My Verizon pre-order arrived with a handful of annoying Verizon apps and games pre-loaded onto the device, but I uninstalled most of them. My T-Mobile review unit had far less bloatware than the Verizon device, and again, most of it was from T-Mobile, not Samsung, and I could uninstall the apps. Samsung no longer tries to force you into using its native apps. They come tucked away in a tidy folder on the app tray and most of them can be uninstalled -- not just hidden. With other apps, like reminders and the weather app, Samsung doesn't even include a home screen or app tray icon unless you enable the feature in the app's settings. Galaxy S8 enterprise potential If any Android device has the potential to edge out the iPhone in the enterprise, it's the Galaxy S8. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus have more to offer businesses, but the Galaxy S8 presents a legitimate alternative for IT. Enterprise adoption will also be pushed by BYOD -- the growing trend of employees using a personal device for work. The Galaxy S8 is primed for BYOD; Samsung Knox not only helps with EMM, it makes it easy for users to keep personal and business data separate. And with the Samsung Dex -- a docking station that lets you use the S8 or S8+ as a full desktop -- businesses will be more motivated than ever to embrace the S8. Samsung has built a smartphone that sets a new standard for other manufacturers, it's a hit with consumers and its appeal could sway the enterprise. With more display real-estate, a high-end design and impressive performance, employees can truly be productive on this device. And with the potential of docking stations like DeX -- full review coming later -- Samsung might be on the cutting edge of consumer technology and business mobility.

This research was done by a group of researchers from the University of Michigan, who claim that the most vulnerable among the lot, is an app called Wifi File Transfer, that has as many as 10 million Android downloads. The researchers scanned almost 100,000 popular apps on Google Play, out of which 1,632 apps created open ports mostly to connect to PCs. Out of these 410 apps had very weak to no security protection, and 57 apps specifically left ports completely open for hackers to tinker with. One of the apps that the researchers found to be particularly dangerous was Wifi File Transfer that has garnered almost 10 million user downloads on Google Play. It essentially lets you connect a PC to a phone through an open port via Wi-Fi, and has no password or fingerprint authentication to protect the user's data. This means that if some unethical user gains access to this port, they can also gain access to all sensitive data as well. This exploit enables hackers to steal data, including contacts or photos, or even install malware. Another app with an authentication flaw was AirDroid, and Wired reports that the developers immediately fixed the bug as soon as the Michigan researchers notified them. However, Wifi File Transfer app makers have failed to acknowledge till date. The full research paper details half a dozen more apps including PhonePal and Virtual USB that create a backdoor for hackers to exploit. The researchers say that the user and Google for that matter is quite helpless in this matter, and developers' will have to do a lot of work on their end to make their services more safe. For now, we recommend you to uninstall Wifi File Transfer and the other mentioned apps, and give priority to security over convenience.

Why are Google, Amazon and eBay ditching support for the Apple Watch? by Chris Smith 11 hours ago 0 shares Read Comments A growing number of major internet companies are dropping support for the Apple Watch. AppleInsider reports Google Maps, Amazon and eBay are among the top tier apps that are no longer supporting a watchOS extension within their iOS apps. Google removed support a few weeks back, while newly-updated eBay and Amazon iOS apps contain no reference to Apple’s wearable. Related: Apple Watch Series 2 review Although none of the companies concerned have explained their reasoning for withdrawing support, it can be assumed the Apple Watch extensions are not being used widely enough to justify the upkeep. The highly-regarded eBay app had appeared to be particularly useful, altering bidders when their offer had been topped. The use-case for Google Maps is pretty evident for those who prefer it to Apple’s own solution, while there’s nothing particularly pressing about shopping from Amazon that it needs to be done on the wrist. The exodus of three top apps (AppleInsider also reports US retailer Target has dropped support) raises questions about whether others will follow suit. None of the firms have commented on their reasons or whether support for the Apple Watch will be reinstated at some stage. Is this the sign of things to come for Apple Watch users?

Google parent Alphabet reported surging quarterly profit that highlighted the ubiquity of its search advertising business — especially on smartphones.   (Michael Short / Bloomberg)   By Alex WebbBloomberg Mon., May 1, 2017 SAN FRANCISCO—Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. posted results last week that extended their dominance of how we shop and search online. Apple Inc. and Facebook Inc. will in the coming days add evidence that tech behemoths command an ever-widening share of consumer time and spending. Amazon’s revenue soared as shoppers favoured it over brick-and-mortar stores, while Google parent Alphabet reported surging quarterly profit that highlighted the ubiquity of its search advertising business — especially on smartphones. “Each has built unique moats that allow them to continue to dominate,” said Ben Schachter, an analyst at Macquarie. “For Google, no one can catch them on search because of the technology and intellectual property. For Amazon, scale is their friend and no one can compete on selection, price and fulfilment capabilities.” Read more: Amazon wants Cheerios, Oreos and other brands to bypass Wal-Mart Article Continued Below The companies have vast networks of complementary products that feed off one another to generate more sales, making it ever harder for competitors to keep up. “Given the strength of Google and Amazon, we think Facebook is likely to look similar,” Schachter said. On Wednesday, Facebook is expected to report first-quarter profit of $2.57 billion (U.S.), up 70 per cent from a year earlier, while revenue climbs 45 per cent to $7.82 billion, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. When Apple reports fiscal second-quarter earnings on Tuesday, sales are expected to climb 5 per cent to $53 billion. Revenue from the App Store and other services such as Apple Music will likely jump 20 per cent to $7.2 billion, according to UBS analyst Steven Milunovich. “The general theme that the big are getting bigger” applies to Apple’s self-feeding ecosystem, Schachter said. Every time Apple sells an iPhone, the customer buys apps and other services, feeding data such as photos and contacts into the device, making it harder to swap for a competitor’s device. Higher margin service revenue then feeds back into Apple’s development budget, helping it build more advanced products to sell to the same consumer. Google’s advertising business is very different, but has similar self-feeding qualities. The company got 97 per cent of mobile paid search clicks in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2017, according to client data from digital marketing firm Merkle Inc. That was up from 82 per cent in the same period in 2014. With more searches, Google gets more ad dollars to reinvest to keep its search engine ahead of the competition — mostly represented by Microsoft Corp.’s Bing. Google also gets more data on what results people click on, which can be used to improve its software even more, and keep people coming back to find information. “There are clear benefits to that scale,” Mark Ballard, senior director of research at Merkle, said. “There’s that feedback loop.” For advertisers, Google’s large online audience makes it one of the first places to go to run online marketing campaigns. The other is Facebook. Merkle client spending on Facebook ads was up 71 per cent in the first quarter, from a year earlier. These advertisers get about 70 per cent of their online traffic from Facebook and that hasn’t changed in recent years despite the rise of competitors like Snap Inc., Ballard noted. Facebook and Google captured 77 per cent of U.S. digital ad spending last year, up from 72 per cent in 2015, according to a recent analysis of data from the Interactive Advertising Bureau by Pivotal Research Group. For advertisers, it’s “easier to concentrate budgets with a smaller number of players. It’s easier to manage,” said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal. Marketers have long griped about the “duopoly” atop digital advertising. But they keep giving Google and Facebook money. That’s largely because few other places offer wide reach, channels for targeting consumers and better returns. Those advantages only multiply as the tech companies expand. Verizon Communications Inc.’s new Oath ad business “may figure out a special sauce, but they will never be the first port of call,” Wieser said. When Google and Facebook get those calls first, they see what advertisers plan to spend elsewhere and can sell them other services and tools, according to the analyst. Advertisers disagree about what company could offer a viable third alternative. Some suggest another internet titan: Amazon. The largest online retailer isn’t a leading digital advertising destination yet, but on its earnings call last week, chief financial officer Brian Oslavsky reported “consistent growth” from that business. Research firm EMarketer expects the company to generate more display ad revenue than Twitter Inc. by next year. Even so, most of Amazon’s first-quarter revenue gains came from grabbing retail market share as more people shop online, rather than in stores. That shift is fuelling a record pace of retailer bankruptcies this year, despite a growing U.S. economy and solid consumer spending. What began with bookstores, movie rental outlets and electronics retailers like Borders, Blockbuster and Circuit City, is spreading to apparel and sporting goods chains like Aeropostale Inc. and Sports Authority Holdings Inc. Once online spending in a category passes 20 per cent, it’s tough for brick-and-mortar retailers to survive and easy for Amazon to gobble up market share, said Guru Hariharan, chief executive officer of Boomerang Commerce Inc., which designs software for large retailers. Amazon has been disciplined about only pursuing retail categories that are already shifting online, giving it momentum against competitors playing defence, he said, adding that more apparel bankruptcies will come in the next two years. Like Google, which has introduced the Pixel smartphone to help secure its direct relationship with consumers, Amazon has introduced the Echo smart speaker to encourage customers to buy services and products from its website. The software makers are expanding into hardware to feed their money machines.

Ireland’s massive tax advantage, which has resulted in 140,000 Irish jobs from American companies located there, could be at an end. President Trump’s new policy, outlined by Treasury Secretary Steve Munchin, would reduce the US corporate tax rate from 35 per cent to 15 percent, just two and a half percent more than Ireland’s 12.5 percent, the lowest in Europe, which has driven American investment to Ireland. According to leading Irish Times business columnist Cliff Taylor Ireland will soon feel the impact. He wrote: “It will remove the current incentive for US companies to establish subsidiaries overseas which results in a reduction in their overall corporate tax bill. “Tax experts believe that this could mean fewer US companies setting up foreign bases in lower tax locations in future – and thus a slowing in the flow of foreign direct investment (FDI) to countries such as Ireland.” While existing companies such as Apple, Google and Facebook are hardly likely to leave Ireland, which has become their European headquarters, new companies may be harder to attract given the near equality in the tax base if the Trump initiative passes, which many experts believe it will. 4 Google's HQ in Dublin city. Ireland's Industrial Development Agency, the IDA, has been incredibly successful in attracting major American multinationals such as Coca Cola, Intel, Facebook, Google, Apple and Pfizer (Viagra) and others on the back of the attractive tax deal. Without that tax incentive, however, it would be a much tougher sell, especially with a president very intent on keeping American jobs in America. It is far too early to speculate what the ultimate outcome will be if the new tax rate comes to pass, but Irish government sources must surely be worried. Without its multinational base secure the just recovering Irish economy could quickly be in difficulties again. 4 Apple HQ, in Cork. However, Ireland continues to have excellent advantages: the only English-speaking country in the EU after Brexit, the educated workforce and the country is seen as an attractive, pro-business destination. However, there is no denying the tax issue is a serious one. As Cliff Taylor stated, “If US companies can, in future, pay 15 percent tax at home, then the push for them to move abroad will lessen.” In addition, Trump is set to offer a once-off tax holiday on funds kept abroad by US companies allowing them to be repatriated in America at a 10 percent rate. That too will impact Ireland where much of those funds are kept in Irish financial institutions as the European headquarters of the companies concerned. 4 A map illustrating the companies in Dublin's Silicon Docks (Via Silcon Roadmap) The Irish government however is adopting a wait and see attitude and not jumping to any hasty conclusions. A spokesman for the Department of Finance said the details of the full changes would determine their impact on Ireland. "The exact implications of US tax reform for Ireland, and the rest of the world, will depend on the exact nature of any changes which are ultimately agreed," the spokesman said. "Ireland’s membership of the EU is, and will remain, a key factor in attracting FDI from the US and elsewhere.  Global business, from the US or elsewhere, will always want to have operations in the EU, and Ireland will remain very competitive and attractive as an EU location to invest in and do business from." American Chamber of Commerce CEO Mark Redmond stated, "We can’t speculate on what might happen in the future, but Ireland has always competed very successfully on the world stage for US FDI. "While it is very important not to be complacent, and we must constantly look for ways in which to improve our competitiveness, we expect that the Irish Government and the IDA will remain committed and successful in the pursuit of new business."

If you don’t want to mess with these files, the OTA updates should start rolling out automatically in the next few days for those products. Google has also posted the details on the new May 2017 security patches.  They include fixing 16 issues that Google has labeled as “Critical”. The company says the biggest such issue they have found is one that could allow hackers to enable “remote code execution on an affected device through multiple methods such as email, web browsing, and MMS when processing media files”. This is the same description that Google has posted for the most critical Android issue it has fixed in the last few months. As with the others, Google says it has seen no examples of any of these issues being exploited out in the wild.

Nexus phones starved of security fixes after just three years That's one way to boost new handset sales 1 May 2017 at 18:27, Shaun Nichols Google has published timelines for when it will kill off security patches for its Nexus-branded Android line. In a quiet update just before the weekend, the Chocolate Factory revealed both the Nexus 6 and Nexus 9 will no longer receive guaranteed security updates as of October of this year. The Nexus 6P and 5X will stop getting guaranteed security patches in September 2018. While Google has previously given the dates for when it will end guaranteed Android operating system updates for the Nexus devices, its latest table adds a column for when security patches will no longer be guaranteed. We at El Reg have decided to add a third column to Google's big data showing the year the doomed Nexus devices hit the market. It is very telling. Device Released End of guaranteed Android updates End of guaranteed security updates Nexus 6P September 2015 September 2017 September 2018 Nexus 5X October 2015 September 2017 September 2018 Nexus 9 November 2014 October 2016 October 2017 Nexus 6 November 2014 October 2016 October 2017 Nexus 5 October 2013 October 2015 October 2016 Nexus 7  (2013) July 2013 July 2015 August 2016 Nexus 4 November 2012 November 2015 November 2015 Nexus 10 November 2012 November 2014 November 2015 Nexus 7  (2012) July 2012 June 2014 June 2015 As the table shows, Google gives customers two years of Android update support and just three years of security patch support – at best. After that, your gadget is fair game to any vulnerabilities found in the software because you'll have no guarantee of any security bug fixes. In short, your Nexus device is considered on its last legs two years after hitting the market, and by year three Google doesn't even see it as worthy of regular security patches. If you bought your Nexus a more than a year after its initial release, you won't even have security patch support through the duration of a two-year carrier contract. By contrast, rival Apple still maintains security update support for the iPhone 5 handset and iPad 4 tablet released in 2012. Cupertino, of course, enjoys the advantage of building both the hardware and software and only releases one new model per year, making extended support far easier to maintain. How old are most Android devices? According to NetMarketShare, around a quarter of Android devices run either Android 4.4 (released in 2013) or Android 5.1 (released in 2015). On the other hand, Google's Nexus line tends to appeal to the early adopter crowd who purchase new handsets more often, so it may be less of an issue for Nexus owners than for other Android buyers. Similarly, Google's Pixel and Pixel XL phones, launched in October 2016, will stop getting guaranteed Android updates from October 2018 and security fixes a year later. ® Tips and corrections 78 Comments MORE Google Apple iPhone Patches More from The Register 'Amnesia' IoT botnet feasts on year-old unpatched vulnerability New variant of 'Tsunami' is a disaster waiting to happen 11 Comments Bookish hacker finds holes in Amazon, Apple, Google epub services 50 shades of spankworthy security 7 Comments Dormant Linux kernel vulnerability finally slayed Just, er, eight years later 43 Comments Mac OS IM tool Adium lagging on library security vulnerability libpurple is a 'binary blob of unknown provenance' says researcher 3 Comments CompSci boffins find Reddit is ideal source for sarcasm database In pleasing irony, Redditors tag their snark and make themselves ideal test subjects 36 Comments USPTO: Hi, Ask Me Anything.

Even though we’re spoiled for choice, the majority of us stick to the tried and tested major players. Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, and Microsoft Edge own the lion’s share of the web browser market. But just because a browser has the most users, it doesn’t necessarily or automatically make it the best. Choosing a web browser is difficult. You have to take several points into consideration. How does it integrate with your technology ecosystem? What can the extensions and add-ons do for you? Is it fast? Is it safe? How much power does the browser use? Read on for the answer to these questions and more. Lowest RAM Usage: GreenBrowser The winner is… not Chrome. Google Chrome is well known as a massive strain on system resources How to Control Google Chrome's Memory Usage and Free Up RAM How to Control Google Chrome's Memory Usage and Free Up RAM Chrome has a reputation for hogging memory. Even Google has shared tips on how to reduce its browser's memory use. We show you how to keep Chrome RAM usage at a minimum. Read More . Google attempts to mitigate the resource hungry browser, but there are other options available. GreenBrowser is a solid browser that is vastly less power-hungry than its competitors. It uses significantly less RAM while remaining at least as fast. In my opinion, GreenBrowser needs more recognition. It is well supported, comes with a raft of features (some that require extensions in the major browsers, such as closing the root tab to close all linked tabs), and still features a wide range of customization tools. Best on Battery: Microsoft Edge Battery use is an interesting category. The proliferation of mobile devices means everyone has a different idea of what constitutes “good.” A casual tablet user isn’t affected by a battery hungry browser in the same way as someone using their laptop for several hours at a time. That said, I’m sure everyone wants the most efficient use of their device. Microsoft Edge is currently top of the battery use charts across laptops and other mobiles devices 5 Simple Ways to Choose the Best Mobile Browser for You 5 Simple Ways to Choose the Best Mobile Browser for You Choosing a browser for your mobile device, whether Android or iOS -- which one do you choose? If your head spins from the variety of mobile browser options, then ask yourself these five questions. Read More . The internet Explorer replacement, introduced with Windows 10, consistently beats Chrome, Opera, and Firefox in browser efficiency and battery rating tests. In this particular area, Microsoft is reaping the rewards of building Edge from the ground up, eliminating many of the vulnerabilities and inefficiencies found in Internet Explorer. Best of Security We measure security across several categories, considering a browser secure if it protects our privacy. We also consider a browser secure when there are minimal vulnerabilities, or if it stays out of the data breach news. With that in mind, we’ve got two security focused browsers that offer slightly different packages. Best for Privacy: Tor Tor remains the most private browser. Tor is absolutely focused on protecting user privacy 4 Anonymous Web Browsers That Are Completely Private 4 Anonymous Web Browsers That Are Completely Private A good way to protect your information on the web is to surf anonymously. Google Chrome’s Incognito mode can help to an extent, but you should also look at the following web browsers. Read More . The browser uses only HTTPS connections, blocks plug-ins, and uses an interconnected system of relay servers to boost user anonymity. Tor has received some negative press due to some of the services that it can hide and provide access to. Furthermore, absolute privacy purists consider Tor tainted. The relay server system — known as nodes — has been compromised by the FBI in order to stop nefarious services that exist in the anonymous darknet. I will make this clear: Tor is focused on privacy. Users gain some security through the emphasis on privacy, but Tor doesn’t have additional anti-malware technology like other popular browsers. Best for Security: Chrome Chrome remains the most secure browser. Tor is focused on anonymity and privacy. Chrome isn’t. However, the simple fact is that Chrome represents one of the single most secure web browsers. At the last Pwn2Own hacking competition, Chrome was the only browser that remained secure New Vulnerabilities Illustrate Yet More Windows 10 Shortcomings New Vulnerabilities Illustrate Yet More Windows 10 Shortcomings Windows has become a byword for computing but Windows' dominance make it a constant target. While Windows 10 is their most secure operating system yet, it still has numerous vulnerabilities which are now coming to... Read More . The year before, 2016, Chrome was only breached once. Unfortunately, Chrome comes with its own irritations. As you would expect, the browser developed by the world’s largest search company is jolly interested in all the data you provide. There are numerous extensions available to curb those privacy issues — ironically, they could be the vulnerability that lets an attacker in. Honorable Mentions Many excellent browsers focus on privacy and security. We’re trying to show you the best of everything, so it wouldn’t be fair to withhold information from your decision-making process. Epic Privacy Browser is solely focused on keeping your identity and privacy secure while browsing. It automatically blocks all tracking attempts and adverts, as well as featuring an integrated proxy. Comodo provides two security and privacy focused browsers: IceDragon and Dragon. IceDragon is based on Firefox while Dragon builds on Google’s open-source Chromium. They both offer SecureDNS servers (a custom domain name filtering system), as well as continuing the experience of each respective browser ecosystem. Fastest Browser: Slimjet One of the most contentious browser measurements is speed. Browser speed is dependent on many things: extensions installed, system specs, internet speed, and much more. The difference comes from the way individual browsers process web pages. For instance, Chrome is a very powerful browser, but can sometimes load slowly. In news no one cares about. I've been trying out the Slimjet browser, and I like it quite a bit. I didn't expect to. — Emoluments Pamphlet (@aspeed) March 21, 2017 However, Slimjet takes the speed crown ahead of the competition. Slimjet is a Chromium-based browser with integrated ad-blocking and anti-tracking tools. It is less resource-heavy than many major browsers, offering similar features without draining resources. Best Ecosystem: Chrome The extensive Google ecosystem includes massively popular web browser Chrome. It is understandable. Using a single account to transfer every single setting between devices is immensely handy. Furthermore, the range of extensions is almost immeasurable, as well as the addition of Google Docs and the numerous other Google services that can be accessed. Unfortunately, Microsoft got the Edge release all wrong. At a time where Microsoft is winning plaudits for its cross-device integration and cloud services, launching the Edge browser without support 5 Reasons Why You Shouldn't Switch to Microsoft Edge Yet 5 Reasons Why You Shouldn't Switch to Microsoft Edge Yet Is Microsoft Edge worth using while Chrome, Firefox, and Opera are still around?

But I’m sure Chrome will continue to dominate this area. Best Tab Manager: Vivaldi How do you use your browser? When writing and researching I might end up with 30 tabs open across three browser windows. Managing tab overload is a difficult task. It can also sow down your system as its resources are slowly squirreled away. Vivaldi introduces some interesting methods for keeping ahead of the sprawl. One of the most interesting features is the ability to display multiple tabs at once on a large screen, all within one browser window. You can then organize the tabs into neat stacks. It is handy for tracking multiple inputs, or quickly comparing information across different websites. Furthermore, you can easily bookmark, name, and minimize tab stacks to keep everything tidy. Tabs can also display notifications from social media sites or email accounts. Vivaldi is a browser with a focus on power users Meet Vivaldi: The Power User's New Favorite Browser Meet Vivaldi: The Power User's New Favorite Browser Meet Vivaldi; a beautiful new web browser aimed at power-users, built by the co-founder of Opera, Jon Stephenson von Tetzchner. Read More , but is equally accessible to regular users. It is built on Chromium, so offers an excellent range of functionality, too. Best Overall Browser: You Decide! Choosing a single browser isn’t easy. My browser of choice is Chrome. But I also use Tor and Microsoft Edge. Your decision will relate to your hardware. If you have a powerful machine with lots of RAM, go-ahead and use Chrome. If you’re using a less-than-powerful machine, consider an alternative that is kinder on system resources. The major browsers remain so as they offer security and accessibility, the two deciding factors for many users. You don’t have to religiously stick to a single browser. Furthermore, there are numerous browsers that we haven’t listed. One of those might suit you down to the ground, so it is worth browsing for an alternative. What is your Windows browser of choice?

Which means Amazon will no longer be giving away free Android apps to anyone who wants them. The good news is that if you didn’t know Actually Free was even a thing, you have a few months left before it disappears. In 2015, Amazon launched the Underground Actually Free program. This allowed Android users to download paid apps and games for nothing, with even the price of in-app purchases slashed. It was a legitimate reason to choose the Amazon Appstore over the Google Play Store Google Play vs. Amazon Appstore: Which Is Better? Google Play vs. Amazon Appstore: Which Is Better? The Google Play Store isn't your only option when it comes to downloading apps -- should you give the Amazon Appstore a try? Read More . Actually Free Is Actually Disappearing Unfortunately, Amazon has now announced it’s discontinuing the Actually Free program. This is in the same blog post that the company promises to “continue to expand the Amazon Appstore experience”. As for Amazon Underground, the shuttering of Actually Free will take place gradually over several stages. First, Amazon will stop accepting new app and game submissions from May 31st, 2017. However, everyone will “continue to enjoy previously installed Underground apps and access the Underground Actually Free store”. And existing developers will continue to get paid for every minute customers spend using their apps. Next, in the summer of 2017, Android devices other than Fire tablets will lose access to the Underground Actually Free store. And access for Fire tablet users will not extend beyond currently supported devices. So don’t buy the next iteration of Fire tablet and expect to nab a load of freebies. All support for the Underground Actually Free program will end at some point in 2019. Which means that even owners of existing Fire tablets will be adversely affected. We have to hope that Amazon will then launch something to replace Underground Actually Free. Otherwise we all lose. Get Paid Android Apps for Free Everyone likes a freebie, and Amazon’s Underground Actually Free program has been providing plenty of them. However, it seems that the costs associated with giving so many freebies away to so many people has forced Amazon to kill the program before it bankrupted the company. Thankfully, there are other ways to get paid Android apps for free legally How To Get Paid Android Apps For Free, Legally How To Get Paid Android Apps For Free, Legally Are there paid apps in the Play Store that you want, but just can't afford?

So don’t mourn the loss of Underground Actually Free too much. Have you been making use of the Amazon Underground Actually Free program? If so, which apps have you nabbed for free?

People don't buy iPhones by the tens of millions just because they like the hardware, though that's a huge part of it, but because they're tied into an ever-growing, sprawling ecosystem of software and services that allow you to do more with the products if you continue to invest in that ecosystem. Let me explain. When Apple introduced the iPhone in 2007, iPod users who were already using iTunes saw something familiar and much more consumer-friendly than BlackBerry, Windows Mobile and Palm devices offered at the time. iTunes was the seed of an ecosystem that, in the past ten years, has grown into a towering elm. The App Store launched in 2008. After that, when people bought apps and games they were also continuing to buy into Apple. As they shelled out $0.99 here and $1.99 there for new software that only ran on their Apple devices, they were digging deeper into Apple's offering and further away from BlackBerry and a new operating system that was on the horizon: Android. Apple continued to build out this ecosystem by changing the way its products interacted with one another. Apple added the ability to use iMessage and FaceTime from an iPad, for example, allowing you to carry on your iPhone conversations on a tablet. Then it introduced a similar feature to Macs, also adding in support for full phone calls. The more Apple devices you used, the better they worked together. Siri launched on iPhone and iPad and eventually on Mac and Apple TV and even the Apple Watch. It became a familiar voice to answer your questions, no matter where you were. Apple TV grew from what Apple CEO Tim Cook once referred to as a "hobby" to a real home streaming device with its own app store. And if you have an iPhone or iPad, all of your pictures through Apple's Photos app are available across devices, even on the TV in your living room. Home, an app in iOS, lets you control light bulbs, window shades, door locks and more, so long as they're build using Apple's HomeKit set of developer tools. As consumers buy these products, they're making a decision to stick with Apple. Customers are more likely to know about them, too, because Apple has a huge retail presence. Walk into an Apple Store and trained employees will show you exactly how to use any of the Apple products you own. Or browse the shelves and purchase any number of products that'll work seamlessly with your iPhone or iPad. The Apple Store is also the company's support hub, where you can go in with any questions, damaged products and more for assistance. If you have AppleCare+, the company's premium warranty plan, it often costs very little to repair your expensive Apple products, sometimes in the same day. Competitors aren't as good at ecosystems Apple's competitors are trying to do something similar. But they're going about it in a much more chaotic way that will confuse most consumers, who don't spend their lives following the ins and outs of the tech industry. Google is making parallel moves to integrate products like the Google Home, the Pixel smartphone, the Chromecast smart TV and more, and that's a step in the right direction. But Google relies mostly on partners to build and maintain its ecosystem of products, and that can be incredibly confusing. How does the owner of an LG Android smartphone know what smart home products it works with? If that same customer buys an Android TV box built by NVIDIA and a smartwatch made by Huawei, who do they go to for support? (Answer: NVIDIA and Huawei, not Google.) Samsung is getting better at creating an ecosystem like Apple's. It sells smartphones, tablets, TVs, wearables, and laptops in the U.S., and it has apps such as SideSync that allow you to interact with your smartphone from a Samsung tablet or laptop. It has services like Samsung Pay, which is arguably better than Apple Pay because it's accepted in more locations. Samsung also owns SmartThings, a smart home technology company that it acquired in 2014 for $200 million. SmartThings is more open than Apple HomeKit, allowing it to support Android and iOS smartphones and a large variety of smart home products ranging from power outlets to door locks and cameras. The difference between SmartThings and Apple Home is that people have heard of Apple Home — you can hardly miss the yellow icon staring at your from your new iPhone — and can manage it easily through a single app on their smartphone. But SmartThings can be controlled by any number of apps and gadgets, including Google Assistant and the Amazon Echo. While it's versatile, it's also a lot more for a consumer to digest, and a lot harder for a consumer to get started. There's no glaring yellow app begging you to dive in on your new smartphone. Todd Haselton | CNBC Samsung doesn't have an big app store. Samsung doesn't have a place to buy music, movies and TV shows. And Samsung doesn't provide as seamless an experience across all of its products (though it's becoming better at it with apps like Samsung Connect, which provide a one-stop destination for viewing and interacting with your Samsung gadgets.) Nor do Samsung or Google have hundreds of high-profile stores around the world. Instead, they rely on small flagship viewing-only locations, pop-up events or dedicated corners in Best Buy, as places to better understand the products. This doesn't help. As product ecosystems become more powerful, consumers need a single easy place to go to learn more about how they can be used. Consumers also need a place to go for support. If you break your Samsung smartphone, you're going to be on the phone with your smartphone insurance provider -- if you bought insurance at all. If you have an iPhone, just walk into an Apple Store. Apple may charge you a premium depending on your warranty status, but you'll have some sort of solution from the company you bought your phone from. That's a big deal. Competitors may be able to build a better smartphone, or better laptop, or better augmented reality device than Apple. But Apple has a years-long head start in building an ecosystem of products that leverage each other's strengths. That's why its services business now is almost the size of a Fortune 100 company alone. That will take a long time for any competitor to equal. And that's why people will keep buying Apple products.

The first update to 7.1.2 features minor bug fixes and a number of security patches for Google Pixel and Nexus devices. Nintendo Switch For the Pixel and Pixel XL, Rogers notes only security updates, with devices on the Canadian carrier no longer receiving their own specific build. However, there are seperate builds for Deutsche Telekom and Verizon. There are 20 issues resolved in the security patch dated 2017-05-01 and 98 in the 2017-05-05 one. According to Google, the two security patch level strings provide “Android partners with the flexibility to more quickly fix a subset of vulnerabilities that are similar across all Android devices.” Google devices will receive the latter patch, while devices from other manufactures will also feature OEM-specific fixes. Vulnerabilities range from moderate to critical, with the most severe possibly enabling remote code execution when browsing, using email, or MMS. As usual, Google notes that there are no reports of customers being affected by these security issues. The full download and OTA links are below.

Image Credit: Google Less than a year after departing Google as its head of human resources, Laszlo Bock has become an entrepreneur. On Monday, he announced that he’s working on Humu, a startup designed to help us work better. He’s joined by Wayne Crosby, Google’s director of engineering who recently resigned. While details are sparse, the company plans on using science, machine learning, and “a little bit of love” to improve our jobs. Humu, likely named after the Hawaii state fish Humuhumunukunukuapua’a, could be an extension of Bock’s experience from shaping the culture at one of the largest tech companies in the world, and it may also leverage insights shared in his book Work Rules! In a 2015 interview, Bock remarked: “We’ve learned a lot over the years about what makes work more meaningful and productive — we’ve studied this at Google, reviewed the academic research and listened to companies far away from Silicon Valley doing inspiring things on the people front. I wanted this book to provide insights from all these sources to help others bring more happiness to the workplace, and to help us all find more inspiration and meaning in the work we do.” Many services have tried to make work fun, but Humu wants to take a different approach, leveraging machine learning and science. How that works exactly remains to be seen, but in a LinkedIn post, Bock wrote about how there should be a way to ensure that employees always have good days at work, and not one where people see it as a job: “We should be constantly learning and growing, and surrounded by people who are doing the same. We all have good days and bad days, but what would work be like if every day were like our best days? Imagine what we could achieve.” There’s currently no timeline for when Humu will officially launch.

Advertisement Sometimes, those new features and those phones really are revolutionary, but more often than not, history has shown us that for every Samsung Galaxy or Apple iPhone, there are a dozen more products with amazing-sounding features that never took off. Here are some of the most significant phone flops of all time. The Nokia N-Gage (2003) Back in 2003, Nokia was still riding high as one of the most successful cell phone makers around. But the world was slowly starting to move to a more connected space. Devices such as Danger’s SideKick and the Palm Treo were starting to show off the possibility of internet-connected mobile phones (i.e. the smartphone). At the same time, portable gaming was becoming more powerful wit Nintendo’s GameBoy Advance, and thanks to the iPod, everyone wanted an MP3 player. So Nokia had an idea: What if there was a device that put all of those things together? And that’s how we got the Nokia N-Gage. First launched in October 2003, this was supposed to be a smartphone, a media player, and a portable gaming machine. Unfortunately for Nokia, it failed at all three. Advertisement We’ve already covered why it sucked as a console, so let’s start with the shape. The N-Gage was shaped like a fucking taco (hence its nickname as “the taco phone”), which might work fine for playing games, but made actually using it as a phone difficult. To talk on the first version of the phone sans headset, users literally had to put the awkwardly-shaped device sideways against their head. Memes were born out of how ridiculous it looked. And the media player features were limited, with no ability to fast-forward or rewind tracks, the inability to put a song on a loop, and no support for playlists. An iPod killer this was not. Try as we might, it was impossible to find a reviewer who liked this gadget. Virtually everyone agreed that this was just a bad idea. But Nokia, God bless them, kept trying with the N-Gage, first with updated hardware, and then with a gaming platform no one used. Finally, in 2009, Nokia finally euthanized the brand. Gizmodo’s then Editor-in-Chief Brian Lam was absolutely brutal in his eulogy for the device, writing, “hope we never have to see you again.” The BlackBerry Storm (2008) If I’m being honest, I could almost write an entire article about all of BlackBerry’s failures at “revolutionary” phones. From the Z10 with its gesture-driven OS that no one made apps for, to the bizarrely-designed Passport that was weird on every level, to the Android-based Priv that I wouldn’t give to my worst enemy, BlackBerry has had a lot of duds over the years. But its biggest disaster is still the BlackBerry Storm. Advertisement Sponsored In 2008, BlackBerry was still one of the world’s leaders, thanks to its trademark keyboarded smartphones like the Curve, the Pearl, and the Bold, which were adored by millions. But the iPhone—then exclusively on AT&T’s network in the US—was rising fast. It had apps and games BlackBerry could only dream of, and its fancy glass touchscreen was a hit. So BlackBerry, largely at Verizon’s behest, decided to create its own touchscreen “iPhone killer.” The Storm was born. It was launched in the US in the fall of 2008 as a Verizon exclusive (it was available on other carriers in other parts of the world). The brilliant minds in Waterloo, Canada weren’t content with just making a touch screen BlackBerry—they decided to help retain the keyboard millions of BlackBerry users loved by making the screen something you could press into to get a clicky feel. None of it really worked right. The old BBOS operating system was never truly optimized for touch, and the mechanical mechanism on the bottom of the screen that accomplished that “clicky” feature was a total dud. Oh, and the phone was designed so quickly, the software was insanely buggy from the get-go. But none of that deterred the BlackBerry faithful—at first. When respected gadget columnist David Pogue, then of The New York Times, gave the phone a blisteringly negative review, he got hate mail from BlackBerry fanbois. The backlash was so intense, it necessitated Pogue write a follow-up column, which included some of the more virulent remarks from BlackBerry defenders “I have serious doubts about your ability to evaluate tech. And your friends, for that matter. Yes, the Storm has a different emphasis than past BlackBerries, but it will continue to sell like pancakes.” History ended up proving Pogue right. The Storm was a flop (and returns were reportedly very high), and it helped set the company down a shame spiral from which it would never really recover. Amazon Fire phone (2014) Before the Fire Phone, Amazon had a lot of success in hardware. Its Kindle e-readers are in a class by themselves, the Fire line of small tablets have always been a good, cheap iPad alternative, and the Fire TV ecosystem is truly excellent. Given that track record, people were really excited about the advent of an Amazon phone. Advertisement In 2014, after months of hype and a reported five years of effort, Amazon finally unveiled its take on a mobile device, the Fire Phone. On paper, the phone came loaded with fancy specs, including five cameras, a 3D display, and a hardware/software feature called Firefly that could identify objects so that you could easily add them to your shopping cart. Although reviews were generally mixed, plenty of tech publications were willing to buy into the hype. Check out what my old colleagues at Mashable had to say about the phone after its release: Advertisement With that philosophy behind it, the Fire pushes Amazon further on the path of becoming the next Apple. ... For the Amazon faithful, Fire completes the platform with the most powerful and intimate of devices — the one that’s carried at all times. For the uninitiated, it’s the most powerful gateway drug the company could have built. Except it ended up not really being a gateway drug, because no one wanted the phone. For all the hype from tech blogs, consumers just didn’t care about the gimmicky features. Even worse, because of politics between Google and Amazon, the FireOS didn’t have access to the Google Play Store, which meant the phone couldn’t easily get Google Maps, Gmail, or Google Docs. Amazon and AT&T cut the on-contract price of the phone from $200 to $0.99 after just six weeks on the market. Amazon’s mobile phone strategy ended up being a gross miscalculation, which cost the company more than $170 million. In the fall of 2015, just over a year after the phone was released, Amazon finally extinguished the Fire Phone for good. Amazon has said it has no plans to re-enter the mobile phone space. That’s probably a good thing. HTC First aka the Facebook Phone (2013) Starting in 2010 and then for the better part of three years, there were rumors and speculation that Facebook was planning its own mobile phone. With every new rumor and speculation, journalists and pundits (including me) were paraded on CNN and CNBC and the like to talk about all the reasons why it made sense for Facebook to have its own mobile phone. Even before it bought Instagram and WhatsApp, Facebook was the most powerful—and most popular—app on iOS and Android. What better way to assume world domination than to make your own “iPhone killer”? Advertisement And so in the spring of 2013, Facebook finally did it. It released its own phone in partnership with HTC, the HTC First. Except, bizarrely, it wasn’t really a “Facebook phone” as much as it was a special Android launcher built by Facebook, which was dubbed Facebook Home. The idea was that you could get all of your Facebook messages directly on your home screen, quickly chat with friends using something called Chat Heads, and get near-instant notifications about what was going on around you. Sounds fun and useful right? Advertisement From Wired’s review: It’s nice to see that after so many failed attempts, Facebook has finally cracked the mobile software riddle. Here’s to hoping it doesn’t screw it up. Well, you know how this ends. It turns out, no one wanted a Facebook launcher on their smartphone. Especially when the smartphone itself was fairly boring. Barely a month after its release, AT&T dropped the price of the HTC First to $0.99 (down from $99). Within a year, Facebook Home was also dead (in truth, Facebook stopped caring about it the moment the HTC First flopped), and Facebook moved on from trying to dominate the home screen into all the ways it could copy Snapchat. Microsoft Kin (2010) Despite being one of the first players in the smartphone space with Windows Mobile, Microsoft has never managed to make the inroads on mobile that it did on the desktop. But of all of Microsoft’s mobile missteps, the worst might just be the short-lived Microsoft Kin. Advertisement Born out of Microsoft’s acquisition of Danger, the company behind the popular SideKick, the Kin was supposed to sit somewhere between a smartphone and a dumbphone. Unlike a true smartphone, the Kin didn’t have apps, but it did have access to social networks such as Twitter, Facebook, and MySpace, as well as Microsoft’s own internal network for storing photos and videos. With a marketing campaign placed squarely at hipsters, the Kin was supposed to be a modern social media phone. But it had one glaring problem: price. Advertisement Early on, a lot of people thought that if Microsoft could release the Kin at a low price without the need for an expensive smartphone data plan (remember the days before data plans?), it could capture the same market segmentation that had made the SideKick so popular in the early aughts. Microsoft and Verizon were alarmingly (in retrospect) coy about the cost of the data plans, but since it was a dumb phone, many of us had hopes that the price would be right. Verizon and Microsoft completely botched the pricing—requiring an expensive $60+ a month smartphone plan for a phone that wasn’t really a full smartphone. Still, I wrote positively about the phone’s potential in an analysis piece in April 2010: Advertisement [The Kin] is really targeted at teenagers — especially younger teenagers. And that’s why Kin might just be brilliant. Of course, I ended up being completely wrong; the teens weren’t interested. Advertisement Just six weeks after launch, Microsoft killed the Kin. According to Business Insider, before the company pulled the plug, the phone sold just 500 units. Brutal. In the wake of the Kin disaster, much was leaked about the infighting and poor strategy that led to the phone’s early demise. Years later, internal videos would show that even before its release, the Kin was just a disaster waiting to happen. Motorola Rokr (2005) In 2005, two of the most powerful consumer electronics brands were Apple and Motorola. Motorola was the leader in dumb phones, thanks to the success of the Motorola Razr. And Apple was well on its way to becoming the world’s most valuable company, thanks to the success of the iPod. So obviously, a fusion between the two companies could only be successful. The resulting phone was called the Motorla Rokr, and it was the first phone with iTunes built in. Motorola’s then chairman and CEO, Ed Zander wanted the world to really love the phone, check out this hype: Advertisement The Motorola ROKR represents the ultimate convergence of mobile communications and music. Fusing iTunes with your always-with-you mobile phone, we’re revolutionizing the way the world experiences mobile self-expression and entertainment. Too bad the phone failed to deliver on those promises. In fact, signs were ominous from the get go. At an iTunes launch event, where Steve Jobs introduced the device to the world, he had problems getting the Rokr to work correctly (you can watch the entire segment in the video above). You can practically see the steam coming out of his ears when the music won’t resume after a phone call. Advertisement In addition to buggy software, users were limited to storing just 100 songs on the device, regardless of how much space was free on the phone. And the process of getting songs onto the phone was a total pain in the ass. Motorola tried to make things better with future iterations of the Rokr line, but the damage was done. The phone was a bomb for Motorola and an embarrassment for Apple. Ultimately, the failure of the Rokr was a good thing. Had it been successful, Apple might not have pushed forward as aggressively with its other phone project, internally known as M68, which became the iPhone. AT&T Picturephone (1964) Before Skype and before FaceTime, AT&T was trying to make video calling a reality. In fact, for more than 30 years, AT&T really tried to make video telephony a thing. It ended up being a great tech demo, but also one of the most expensive tech flops of all time. The first AT&T Picturephone made its debut at the World’s Fair in Flushing Meadow Park in 1964. The demo—which my own mother saw as a teenager—left attendees excited about the future. Stanley Kubrick used ideas from the Picturephone in his epic, 2001: A Space Odyssey. Product brochures from the era promised “the bold beginning of tomorrow’s telephoning.” Unfortunately for AT&T, which spent half a billion on R&D for the PicturePhone between 1966 and 1973), “tomorrow” was really about 45 years away. Advertisement At its peak in the 1970s, AT&T never managed to amass more than 500 subscribers to its video telephony service. The costs were just too high, the products too big, and the value was too unclear. AT&T’s subsequent efforts at video telephony into the 1990s failed too. In 2005, Skype finally brought video calling to the masses—and for free. In 2010, Apple launched FaceTime, which finally, for real, made two-way video calling from your actual phone (or in this case, smartphone) a thing. ESPN Phone (2005) Back in the mid-aughts, there was a bizarre trend where non-phone companies decided to try their luck at being mobile carriers. Known as mobile virtual network operators (MVNO), the idea was that brands could lease spectrum from established wireless carriers to sell their own phones and services. Virgin Mobile, TracPhone, and Cricket Wireless all started out as MVNOs. For whatever reason, ESPN thought it would be a good idea to get into the branded phone and carrier space, and it launched Mobile ESPN in early 2006 with a big, glitzy Super Bowl ad (above). ESPN really believed that people would pay $400 for its clamshell dumbphone, a Sanyo MVP (a Sanyo!), along with plans that started at $35 a month for just 100 minutes of service, with no free nights or weekends. Advertisement Why would anyone do this? Well, ESPN was convinced that sportsmen love sporting so much that they would be willing to pay a premium for a shitty phone running on the Sprint network (Sprint!) that would get the sports alerts and updates. The phone also offered subscribers access to mobile video of SportsCenter, score updates, and highlights. As silly as this all sounds now, some tech reviewers actually bought the concept. From PCMag’s review, which gave the phone four stars: Advertisement The Mobile ESPN MVP is a very good voice phone loaded up with massive quantities of sports information. You’ll pay top dollar for top data, but have you seen the price of a Giants ticket recently? The general public didn’t agree with that whole “pay top dollar for top data” argument and the phone ended up being a fairly famous business disaster. Advertisement Just nine months after its splashy launch, ESPN killed Mobile ESPN. At the time, BusinessWeek reported in 2006 that ESPN had managed to gain just 30,000 subscribers, well below the 500,000 figure needed to make the investment break even. In hindsight, ESPN’s then president George Bodenheimer probably should have listened to Steve Jobs, who according to the book Those Guys Have All the Fun: Inside the World of ESPN, told him “your phone is the dumbest fucking idea I have ever heard of.” Stick to sporting, sportsmen. Samsung Galaxy Beam (2012) Samsung has made a lot of good phones over the years, exploding Note 7s notwithstanding. But Samsung has also made some supposedly innovative but really, really dumb phones. Take for example, the Samsung Galaxy Beam, which the company announced at Mobile World Congress in 2012. It was basically a Galaxy S Advance with a pico projector built-in. Advertisement Samsung actually tried to do the whole phone projector thing in Korea a few years before bringing a version to North America. For whatever reason, the company really thought that people would want to use their smartphone as a way to project content at low resolution on a big screen. The company even made ads showing off the most unrealistic proposal of all time (above). Samsung was positively breathless in its marketing copy for the phone, with its then mobile chief, JK Shin, saying: Advertisement Galaxy Beam provides mobile freedom, enabling a unique shared experience around digital content for everyone-anywhere and instantly-from a smartphone as slim and portable as any on the market. Sadly, that “unique shared experience” came by way of an overpriced, bulky, phone with specs straight out of 2010, running an old version of Android. Even after lackluster response to the original Beam, Samsung still wasn’t willing to give up the ghost. In 2014, the company released a successor—that still had shitty, outdated specs (again, the whole thing was very 2010), aimed at the Chinese market. Advertisement Come on Samsung, know when to let a product die. No one wants a projector on their smartphone and no one will ever propose using said projector. Google’s Project Ara (2013 - 2016) Technically, Project Ara wasn’t a phone—it never had a chance to be. Instead, it was a project Google invested years of time (and lots and lots of hype), only to ultimately cancel the device in 2016. Advertisement But let’s back up. Back in 2013, Motorola (then part of Google), announced that it was working on a modular phone platform, known as “Project Ara.” Project Ara was a basic phone with removable modules that could be switched out or upgraded, kind of like LEGO blocks. The idea was that instead of having to constantly upgrade an entire phone, specific components—the camera system, the storage, the CPU, and the battery—could all be expanded or upgraded with a new module. Additional modules could be available for extra stuff such as a a night vision camera or even a tardigrade aquarium. Advertisement The tech press (including Gizmodo), was all too happy to spread the hype about this concept. Check out what we wrote about the concept, which had already been delayed several times at this point, back in 2015: This is the powerful idea behind Project Ara—the exact smartphone you want, exactly when you need it. Going on a long trip and need battery life? Swipe out for a low-res screen and extra battery modules. Need to take great photos at your kids soccer game? Get that camera module packed with megapixels. It’s an ambitious dream to be sure, and one that won’t jibe with everyone, but it’s an idea worth exploring just to see where it goes. Too bad that “powerful idea” never turned into a real product. Not only did the project’s specifics change direction with alarming regularity (originally it was hyped by Google as a $50-$100 device; by 2016 the company admitted the first phones would cost the same as premium handsets), the people in charge of running the project changed too. According to Venture Beat’s excellent history of Project Ara, the development team never really recovered after Regina Dugan, who ran ATAP at Google (the division Project Ara was under), abruptly left for Facebook. And look, it’s possible that with the right leadership and support, Project Ara could have met the finish line, but that doesn’t change a very large, very fundamental problem with Project Ara (and modular smartphones in general): No one wants a modular smartphone. Project Ara is the most ambitious modular phone failure, but even modular phones from LG and Motorola have totally flopped and failed to take on with audiences. Advertisement Ultimately, Project Ara was a great demo, but it never had a chance at being a real product. And even if it had reached the finish line, something tells me that it would have wound up on this list anyway.   Recommended Stories Why These Great Game Consoles Failed Spectacularly Why These 'Revolutionary' '80s Gadgets Totally Failed Samsung Galaxy S8 Review: The Prettiest Phone Wins Christina Warren christina.warren@gizmodo.com @film_girl Christina is a senior writer at Gizmodo.

Chris Davies - May 1, 2017 1 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Don’t expect the Surface Book 2, Surface Pro 5, or even a Surface Phone at Microsoft’s event this week, but do expect its answer to Google’s Chromebook. Anticipation for what the software giant will do next with its premium Surface range has never been higher, not least because it was a disappointing glitch in an otherwise healthy financial quarter. It looks, though, like we’ll have to wait a little longer to see how Microsoft will address that, because the company is too busy going back to school. It’s an opportunity to cash in on a potentially lucrative market, though one in which Microsoft is playing catch-up. If the rumors are true, the strategy is a new version of Windows 10, intended especially for use in schools and similar environments. Expected to be called Windows 10 Cloud, it’s Microsoft’s answer to Google’s Chrome OS. Chrome OS was an intriguing side-project when Google first launched it five years ago, but over the intervening period it has gained real traction. A significant part of that success is down to education settings, where Google’s remote administration, cloud-first storage and app system, and focus on low-cost hardware has won it fans among cash-strapped schools and colleges. The rise of Google’s software services in general use like Google Docs has only made Chrome OS more palatable. At the same time, Apple has been pushing iPad as an education platform, for many of the same reasons that Chromebooks have been popular. With straightforward apps, relatively affordable hardware in comparison to traditional notebooks, and a suite of bundled software, Apple has successfully made inroads into markets where once a Windows PC would’ve been the de-facto classroom choice. The time, therefore, is ripe for Microsoft to offer its own cloud-centric system. It fits, too, with the company’s growing reliance on hosted services as a significant part of its revenue stream. Income from Microsoft’s “Productivity and Business Processes” rose 22-percent in the most recent quarter, with Office 365 commercial revenue contributing in particular. Judging by the previous leaks, some of the most popular aspects of Chrome OS and iOS will be replicated by Windows 10 Cloud. Microsoft is apparently targeting a swift start-up – 20 seconds or less – and an even quicker resume time of under two seconds. Battery life should be more than 10 hours, at least on paper, and certainly enough to last a full day away from the charger in typical classroom use. Exactly what Microsoft is likely to show at its “MicrosoftEDU 2017” event in New York City tomorrow, May 2, is unclear at this stage, though a few things seem likely. Along with the official reveal for Windows 10 Cloud, a Microsoft-made notebook running the platform looks almost certain. After all, as Surface has shown us, though a software and cloud services business, Microsoft is still willing to lead by example. That example, though, should have a knock-on effect on Windows OEMs. It’s possible we’ll also see a number of third-party “Windows 10 Cloudbooks” on-stage, in an attempt to show that – just like Chrome OS – the platform has broad support from device makers. Still, there are some lingering questions. One of the biggest is whether Windows 10 Cloud will be offered solely on new notebooks or if users will be able to install it themselves on their existing hardware. Chrome OS, after all, has given old laptops a new lease of life, given it has far less demanding system requirements than Windows typically does. Following that pattern could give Microsoft a bigger pool of potential users, though it could also eat into regular Windows 10 sales. Given the expectation is that the Windows 10 Cloud experience will be fairly controlled – apps like Office, for instance, are expected to only be available through Microsoft’s own download store – it wouldn’t surprise us if new devices were the only way to get the platform. At least, that is, until it has gained some traction. Similarly we don’t know whether Microsoft will be initially open to individual sales, or focusing first on selling to school districts and similar. We’ll know more tomorrow, May 2, when Microsoft gives Windows 10 Cloud its big reveal. It seems likely that Google and Apple will be watching closely, too.

ShellyPalmer Search Menu I’d Pay You $500,000 a Year, but You Can’t Do the Work by Shelly Palmer | April 23, 2017 Clients want us to deliver online experiences that are competitive with Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google, and other top-tier tech companies because that’s what consumers demand. This has created a war for talent unlike anything I’ve seen in my career. While it must be fought, it can never be won because the rules are not what they seem. Our clients want web and native experiences that look, feel, and perform like they were built by Facebook, Netflix, Microsoft, Google, Apple, etc. (and the back ends to support them). Each of these companies build with very specific programming languages and frameworks. If you want to build a project for a client that looks and feels as good as Facebook, why wouldn’t you use their code?   They have massive teams of designers and engineers with unique combinations of aesthetics, aptitude, and technical skills. So, we are on a Grail Quest for similar talent – the best of the best React/Redux specialists, Unity developers, data scientists, and data engineers (proficient with TensorFlow), technical project managers (who used to do the above, but have evolved into managers), and technical account executives. The problem is, if you’re good enough to work for us, you’re good enough to work for them, or anyone else for that matter. And while we have done our best to build a yellow brick road to our company, the yellow brick road that leads to top-tier tech actually has a metaphoric Emerald City at its end. Don’t get me wrong; we have a small but mighty team and we fight considerably above our weight. But if we could win the talent war (or even just a few more battles), our growth potential would be unlimited. The last three perfect candidates took jobs at Google and Facebook instead of coming to work for us … not a big surprise. The Game Is Rigged Over the past few years, IT old-timers have started to accept open source as an excellent way to economically test, fail, and learn. GitHub (the most popular open source community) is a haven for engineers. If you write great code, you are rewarded by popularity, as well as the accolades of your peers. It is one of the purest meritocracies in the world. GitHub is also the place where top-tier tech companies make would-be proprietary programming languages, frameworks, and tools available for free – a Machiavellian move that allows engineers to self-select into a pool of qualified applicants perfectly trained to work for them. And, here’s why the rules are not what they seem: if you build something popular on GitHub using Facebook’s or Google’s code, they will see it, and a recruiter will contact you. That’s how the “GitHub recruiting pipeline” works. We Run a Business, Not a School I am personally amazed by the number of recruiters who have sent us “vetted” professional coders who can’t actually code. This is such a serious problem that if a recruiter sends us three candidates who cannot pass our coding test, we fire the recruiter. We can’t afford to waste the time. Tech recruiters charge 18 to 25 percent of the first year’s salary, but even the best recruiters we’ve worked with cannot truly vet the types of engineers we need. As far as I can tell, recruiters are not under pressure to learn, because high-end tech talent is so rare, hiring managers will take practically anyone who can fog a mirror. We won’t. And you shouldn’t. In practice, we could train these workers, but not at market prices with added recruiter vigorish. We just can’t get enough value out of B-team players while they are in training, and by the time we help them become A-team players, their GitHub accounts and contributions will reflect their learning. At that point, they will be firmly on the radar of top-tier tech. And we would have played the role of pre-school for Facebook, Google, or Apple. Great for Zuck, Larry, or Tim, but not so great for us. There Must Be Somewhere to Learn This Stuff There is somewhere to learn this stuff. You learn it by doing it every day and communicating with the community that is doing it every day. It’s not taught in schools and it is constantly evolving. In fact, this may be top-tier tech’s secret weapon. Just like Tim Cook (Apple) owns the physical supply chain for every component you might need to make a smartphone, top-tier tech literally owns the programming languages and frameworks used to create them – even though they are free for all of us to use. Awesome and Insane None of this would be an issue if top-tier tech did not make its code available open source. We have this problem only because they need talent as much as we do. That said, we’re going to keep looking for amazing programmers and my offer stands. I can’t wait to pay you $500,000 per year. You just have to be an awesome and insane engineer with enough skills and work ethic to keep the work we do for our clients as good as the work at the biggest and best tech companies in the world. Feel free to send me a link to your GitHub account. No resumes required. A note from the author before you write a comment: It seems that some readers and tweeters are worried that I do not understand that there is more to talent recruiting and retention than money. I understand that very well, which is why we are blessed to work with some of the most talented people in the world. This article is about a narrow issue — a lack of engineers with very specific, highly in-demand skill sets. It attempts to explain how top tier tech has strategically monopolized an incredibly important recruiting pipeline using open source. On that subject, I would welcome your thoughts.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Tue, May 02, 2017 - Page 10　 Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp UK warns Internet giants about hate Bloomberg British Home Secretary Amber Rudd leaves 10 Downing Street in London on Tuesday last week. Photo: AFP British Home Secretary Amber Rudd warned Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc’s Google and Twitter Inc to improve monitoring of extremist and hate content after a panel of lawmakers urged her to consider making the hosting of such material a crime. A report from the British Parliament’s cross-party Home Affairs Committee, that was to be published yesterday, said the companies are “shamefully far” from having done enough to deal with illegal and dangerous content and was scornful of claims that there is little more they can do. It is “shocking” that Google’s YouTube subsidiary allows paid advertising to appear alongside videos created by terrorist groups, the panel said. The report comes days after the British government protested a decision by Twitter to stop letting security officials track terrorist-related posts. While Rudd stopped short of agreeing with the committee’s recommendation to look at legislation, lawmakers are becoming more confrontational with Internet giants. “We have made it very clear that we will not tolerate the Internet being used as a place for terrorists to promote their vile views, or use social media platforms to weaponize the most vulnerable people in our communities,” Rudd said in an e-mailed statement. “We will continue to push the internet companies to make sure they deliver on their commitments.” The committee’s inquiry was sparked by the murder of House of Commons lawmaker Jo Cox during the referendum campaign last year on leaving the EU. It examined online material and considered whether it might be encouraging hate crime. Among its conclusions were that YouTube is “awash” with racist material. It said the company refused to remove a video by Ku Klux Klan former grand wizard David Duke titled Jews admit organizing White Genocide, saying it “did not cross the line into hate speech.” Twitter hosted “significant numbers of racist and dehumanizing tweets that were plainly intended to stir up hatred,” the panel said. The company removed many of them after the lawmakers complained, but it refused to delete a cartoon showing “ethnic minority migrants tying up and abusing a semi-naked white woman, while stabbing her baby to death,” because it did not breach its “hateful conduct policy,” the report said. Facebook had community pages “devoted to stirring up hatred, particularly against Jews and Muslims,” the panel said. The company removed some posts that the committee highlighted, but said the community pages were not violations. The report criticizes the companies for relying on others to report offensive material, “outsourcing the vast bulk of their safeguarding responsibilities at zero expense.” It said that soccer teams are required to pay the costs of policing matches and urged the government to consult on whether Internet companies should have to pay the cost of policing their sites. “The major social media companies are big enough, rich enough and clever enough to sort this problem out — as they have proved they can do in relation to advertising or copyright,” the report said. “It is shameful that they have failed to use the same ingenuity to protect public safety and abide by the law as they have to protect their own income.” Facebook said it has “quick and easy” ways for users to report content and “nothing is more important” to the company than people’s safety. 1 2 NEXT › This story has been viewed 1563 times.

Officials want to end rent court disparities Business Technology Forget flying cars: Google's Brin is secretly building an airship Sergey Brin Laurent Gillieron / EPA Sergey Brin, Google's co-founder and president of its parent company Alphabet, during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Jan. 19. Sergey Brin, Google's co-founder and president of its parent company Alphabet, during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Jan. 19. (Laurent Gillieron / EPA) Ashlee VanceBloomberg Larry Page has his flying cars. Sergey Brin shall have an airship. Brin, Google co-founder, has secretly been building a massive airship inside of Hangar 2 at the NASA Ames Research Center, according to four people with knowledge of the project. It's unclear whether the craft, which looks like a zeppelin, is a hobby or something Brin hopes to turn into a business. "Sorry, I don't have anything to say about this topic right now," Brin wrote in an email. The people familiar with the project said Brin has long been fascinated by airships. His interest in the crafts started when Brin would visit Ames, which is located next to Google parent Alphabet Inc.'s headquarters in Mountain View, California. In the 1930s, Ames was home to the USS Macon, a huge airship built by the U.S. Navy. About three years ago, Brin decided to build one of his own after ogling old photos of the Macon. In 2015, Google unit Planetary Ventures took over the large hangars at Ames from NASA and turned them into laboratories for the company. Brin's airship, which isn't an Alphabet project, is already taking shape inside one. Engineers have constructed a metal skeleton of the craft, and it fills up much of the enormous hangar. Alan Weston, the former director of programs at NASA Ames, is leading Brin's airship project, according to the people, who asked not to be named discussing the secretive plans. Weston didn't respond to requests for comment. Weston has a background befitting such an unusual enterprise. Born to Australian parents, Weston spent some of his youth in Turkey and then ended up at the University of Oxford. There he became a key member of the Dangerous Sports Club — a group of very intelligent risk-takers that formed in the early 1970s and did things such as catapult people across fields into nets. Amazon's latest idea: A flying warehouse that will deliver your stuff by drone Brian Fung Amazon is exploring the use of giant airships to serve as mobile, flying warehouses that could help the online retail giant deliver more of its goods by drone. You might already be familiar with Amazon's drone delivery service, which recently received a demo in the United Kingdom for the first... Amazon is exploring the use of giant airships to serve as mobile, flying warehouses that could help the online retail giant deliver more of its goods by drone. You might already be familiar with Amazon's drone delivery service, which recently received a demo in the United Kingdom for the first... (Brian Fung) Members of the club are credited with inventing the modern form of bungee jumping. Weston, for example, performed one of the first bungee jumps by hurling himself off California's Golden Gate Bridge and then eluded the authorities waiting to capture him on shore. He also hiked Mt. Kilimanjaro in Africa and then attempted to hang-glide down, only to crash and hurt his ankle in the process. Years later, Weston joined the Air Force and did engineering work as part of the U.S. government's Strategic Defense Initiative — known more broadly as the Star Wars missile defense system. In 1989, Weston oversaw one of the first tests of Star Wars, which aimed to destroy incoming Russian missiles midair with weapons fired from space. Following his stint at the Air Force, Weston joined NASA and worked on a wide number of projects, including the development of a low-cost lunar lander. In a radio interview in 2013, Weston described plans for an airship that could be used to haul cargo. The idea is that airships could be more fuel-efficient than planes and could carry loads directly to where they're needed, rather than to transport centers like airports or shipping stations. "New airship technologies have the promise to reduce the cost of moving things per ton-mile by up to an order of magnitude," Weston said in the interview. "It depends on the size of the airship. A larger airship can reduce costs a lot more than a smaller ship, but there's design of a class of vehicles that can lift up to 500 tons that could be actually more fuel-efficient than even a truck." He went on to describe a prototype he was considering of a helium-based craft that appeared to breathe. "And so the way that works is that the helium in the main envelope is taken and stored in bags inside the airship at a slightly higher pressure," he said. "As you do that, air is taken in from the outside into essentially like lungs that are attached in the side of the vehicle. So the analogy of breathing is a good one. And the overall lift of the vehicle is equal to the weight of the air that is being displaced by the helium. And as you change that, you can control the amount of buoyancy that the vehicle has." This technique, according to Weston, would allow the airship to carry 500 tons without the need for a ballast. After being contacted about the airship, Weston changed his profile on LinkedIn to list his current job as chief executive officer of "Ltare." He then removed the post. There have been many attempts to build airships of this type in recent years. It's fitting for such a project to take place in Silicon Valley, which seems to have entered a steampunk phase, as people race to build things ranging from flying cars to tiny reusable rockets. Brin's airship is separate from a freight project called Calcifer that was shelved by Google X, the company's experimental research lab, in 2014. Alphabet CEO Page, Brin's Google co-founder, has funded at least two secretive flying-car projects — startups Kitty Hawk and Zee.Aero, also separate from Alphabet. Page has begun to take the wraps off one of these efforts — on Monday, Kitty Hawk released a video showing one of its all-electric vehicles taking off and soaring over a lake with the driver perched on top.

And so, photographer Anthony Morganti decided to create this video and share 3 basic ways to search for and find your stolen photos online. Morganti doesn’t break new ground here, but his video offers a solid overview of some basic methods that will be especially useful if you’re a beginner who is starting to deal with image theft for the first time. 1. Google and Google Alerts The first is the most simple, but probably still underused, way to find your photos online: Google yourself and your website. Better yet, set up a couple of Google alerts, and Google will email you every time someone mentions you. This is a great way to keep track of mentions and link-backs online, but it’s also a good way to find the places where people are “borrowing” your images with credit, but not permission. In the video, Morganti shows you how he created his Google alerts and offers a basic (but important) tip to make sure your inbox isn’t flooded with irrelevant alerts. 2. Reverse Image Search The most-used and still probably most-useful free way to find your images online, Reverse Image Search is an indispensable tool. In the video, Morganti covers three different options. You can search by Image URL, you can upload your images one by one to Google Image search, or you can right click on an image (only available in Chrome and Firefox) and select “Search Google for Image.” It’s a basic approach, but to quote the movie Anchorman, “60% of the time, it works EVERY time.” 3. Invisible Watermarks The final approach Morgani discusses is a bit more advanced and, as a result, it costs money. Using a paid service like Digimarc, you can add “invisible” watermarks to your image. We put invisible in quotes because pixel peepers might be able to sniff it out in Photoshop, but otherwise it’s extremely difficult for the human eye to detect. Can you see the watermark? It’s there… “But what good is a watermark if it’s invisible?” you may ask. Digimarc uses these invisible marks to find your images online with their own special reverse image search, generating a report that shows you everywhere your photo has been shared with and without permission. True, it’s a paid service, but if you’re serious about keeping track of your images and finding infringers, this approach is hard to beat. *** There are many ways to keep track of your stolen photos online, but these three methods will cover you pretty well without eating up all of your time or covering your photos in ugly watermarks. Check out the video up top to see each method demonstrated, and if you like what you see, you can dive deeper on Morganti’s YouTube channel.

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     Google Pixel Will Be Dead In 2018 Posted: May 1 2017, 11:12am CDT | by Ahmed Humayun, in News | Technology News     End-of-life dates for Pixel phones announced by Google It would be useless to explain why every phone has an end-of-life stage. Everyone including the manufacturer and the consumers move on two new smartphones, which is why it is pointless to keep throwing updates for every device forever. Google’s Pixel phones have also lived out their days and Google has now announced their end-of-life dates. Don't Miss: Find a Nintendo NES Classic in stock According to Google’s statements, Pixel and Pixel XL, released in October last year, will receive updates till at least October 2018. After the two-year of life of these two devices, Google may or may not develop any further updates for them. So it would be clear to expect no further updates once the two-year point is hit. Google has surely kept their device lineup in mind while deciding these dates. By the last quarter of 2018, there will surely be newer models up for grabs. Apart from that, Google is willing to develop security updates for Pixel and Pixel XL till October, 2019. The same rule follows here, it will be up to Google to decide whether they will provide security updates after the r-year life of these models are completed. This story may contain affiliate links.

Google Maps v9.51 beta adds new details about parking, prepares to improve route planning with parking suggestions and traffic charts [APK Teardown + Download] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/04/21 11:17am PDTApr 21, 2017 51 Plus 1 on G+ 82 Share on Facebook 55 Share on Twitter Total Shares188 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Article Contents 1 What's New 1.1 New parking indicators 2 Teardown 2.1 Change your route to nearby parking 2.2 Traffic Histogram 3 Download It's time for another update to Google Maps. Like so many other version bumps, this one includes a couple of great gifts to get users where they want to go. The focus of this release appears to be directed at parking. There are now indicators to show if there is on-site parking and whether it's free or paid. The theme continues into the teardown with a feature that will help drivers plan to find parking near their destination before getting there. If you're already signed up to the beta, this update might already be waiting for you. Otherwise, you can hit the link at the bottom to download the apk. What's New Unofficial Changelog: (the stuff we found) Free / Paid indicator for parking on detail pages Destinations now show if there is on-site parking New parking indicators Google has been on a roll with parking-related features since they were introduced earlier this year. The latest update digs a bit deeper to inform drivers about the parking situation before getting to a destination. The first addition can be found in the details page, which indicates if parking at that location is free or paid. As the screenshot shows, the line can be found just below the address in most cases. However, parking details aren't available for very many locations yet, so you probably can't count on seeing it at most destinations. At this time, the field only shows if parking is free or paid, but doesn't appear to include prices for paid parking. To get prices, you'll probably still have to resort to other methods. Perhaps this will be added in a future update like it was with fuel prices. Left: previous version. Right: latest version. (Look for the red and blue markers.) The other adjustment comes in the form of a new type of parking difficulty indicator. In previous versions, Maps would show one of three levels: Easy, Medium, and Limited. The latest update adds On-site to the mix, which shows drivers if they can park at their destination or plan to search for a spot nearby. Unfortunately, this change does introduce something of a regression in usability. As the screenshots above show, the on-site indicator replaces the difficulty marker. If parking happens to be fairly terrible at your destination, you'll have no idea about that until you're driving around with no hope of finding an available space. Considering how much effort has gone into assessing parking difficulty, this will probably be fixed fairly soon. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. Change your route to nearby parking Navigation apps are great for getting us to a place, but most of them have been designed with a bit of intentional tunnel vision. We might say we want to go to some place, but what we really mean is that we have to drive to a slightly different place to park, then walk (or whatever) to the real destination. The Google Maps developers are working to address this common scenario and help drivers make the decision to reroute to nearby parking. New text in the apk describes a feature that will prompt users to add a parking lot to their routes. Basically, it will offer to search for parking lots and garages near the destination and offer up a list. Users will then be able to pick a parking location, which will then be added to the route. code <string name="ACCESSIBILITY_ADD_PARKING">Adds the parking lot to the route.</string> <string name="ACCESSIBILITY_ADD_PARKING_LONG">Adds %1$s as a parking lot on the route</string> <string name="FIND_PARKING_NEAR_DESTINATION">Find parking near destination</string> <string name="ADD_PARKING">Add parking</string> <string name="EDIT_PARKING">Edit parking</string> <string name="FIND_PARKING">Find parking</string> <string name="PARKING_SEARCH_QUERY">Parking</string> <string name="PARKING_SEARCH_FAILED">Can't search</string> <string name="NO_PARKING_LOTS_FOUND">Can't find any parking lots or garages near there</string> <string name="PARKING_NEARBY_DESTINATION">near %1$s</string> Based on the wording, I assume the parking location will be placed immediately before the destination instead of replacing it, which makes sense if you need walking directions after parking the car. On the subject of walking, search results will be presented with an estimate of how long it will take to walk from a parking area to the final destination. <string name="SEE_MORE_PARKING_OPTIONS">See more options</string> <string name="PARKING_WALKING_TIME_ADDITION_GREATER_THAN_ONE">+%1$s walk</string> <string name="PARKING_WALKING_TIME_ADDITION_LESS_THAN_ONE"><1 min walk</string> There seems to be one catch: The parking recommendations seem to be incompatible with routes involving multiple stops. I doubt there's a technical reason these two features can't coexist, so it's probably a decision to avoid building an overcomplicated interface. <string name="PARKING_NOT_SUPPORTED_MESSAGE">Parking was removed because it's not supported for multiple stops</string> Overall, I think this is going to be a great addition and will save a lot of people from the pattern of first driving to a place and then driving in circles for another 15-20 minutes desperately searching for parking. Traffic Histogram For many years, Google has been able to tell us with bewildering accuracy just how long a drive should take. This isn't just a matter of calculating distance and speed limits, but also making estimates based on established traffic patterns. While it's nice to get an idea of the total time, some drivers certainly want to know if part of their trip is going involve slowly creeping through nearly standstill traffic. Google is working to put that information in front of users with a chart of anticipated traffic density throughout a drive. The string below spells out the concept pretty clearly. <string name="ACCESSIBILITY_TRAFFIC_TREND_BAR_CHART">A time-series histogram showing how much traffic is on your route today.</string> There's next to zero information beyond the string below, but I would expect the histogram to look like the busyness chart introduced late last year, but with shorter time increments – maybe every 10 or 15 minutes. Most people will probably see this as a "nice to know" type of feature, but it could be a life saver for drivers that get panicky in heavy traffic, or at least a useful tool for road trippers. I know I'd like to get a good look at traffic in a few spots before driving down to the Bay Area next month. Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way. Rather than wait for Google to push this download to your devices, which can take days, download and install it just like any other APK.

SyCoREAPER So I should use Waze and Google maps at the same time? Be sensible. Suicide_Note I look up stuff with Maps, but use Waze for the actual navigation.

Alfonso Surroca You'll never see speed traps on Google Maps. There has to be some kind of liability they would want to stay far away from. I'm honestly surprised (and relieved) they allowed Waze to keep that feature when they bought it. Loco Mole Nah, there are TOCs and stuff that can limit or release them from liabilities. Heck, one could already say the same regarding liabilities about lane guidance on navigation software! They make drivers clog the left lanes and causing accidents (sarcasm). mobilemann I can't believe you think you're nearly smart enough to give advice to anyone. Stefan van Aalst And speedometer AndrewNeo Still restricted to the Bay Area, apparently. Mr Trex I actually had it pop up in California back in November but went away. adam seymour why don't them google bitches add approximate calories burnt between walking destinations EcE Why don't they add number of Starbucks between walking destinations?! waloody88 lol waloody88 don't tell me you want google to add more bloat and make maps another social app. in fact i don't use it because it too bloated and lack some basic features like speed limits and a proper downloadable maps for travelers. Aloys Garnier de Kermerc’hou You have Fit for that. icwhatudidthere Google still doesn't know that people also drive to train stations or bus stations, park their car and commute by mass transit. David Hyman Super excited about the parking near the destination. That has screwed me in the past many times Mertcan Kaya Location sharing still isn't available in Turkey. oningam Uhm, marginally useful what is still missing from maps is real intelligence not based only on history but capable to make predictions based on anticipated events like a one time sport match or a big concert. Talking about routes there should be more options to choose from like cheapest or at least there must be a way to turn off specific toll roads because they are not all equal and actually only distance/time/speed is taken into account without considering the cost. About A.I. it would be really appreciable to get the lowest fuel cost on route. And finally I'm obviously missing speed limit indications.

Image: Nvidia Although artificial intelligence (AI) is more than machine learning (ML), and ML is more than deep learning (DL), DL is an important part of AI that has seen lots of progress and hype as of late. Winning the hearts and minds of developers and creating an ecosystem around frameworks will be very important for this space going forward. must read Digital transformation: Making it work in the real world It takes more than shiny new technologies to remake business processes. Here are a few ideas on how to make digital transformation projects work in your organisation. Read More Taking a look at the history of Android can provide some insights, and it looks like Google is the first to learn from its own success there. Open-sourcing TensorFlow in late 2015 caused a commotion, and some go as far as to say that Google has already won the DL framework race with TensorFlow. It may be a bit early for such claims though, and the people behind Caffe2 beg to differ. AI's not a competition -- but who's winning? So, what does winning even mean here? What are the criteria for defining a winning DL framework? If it's mindshare we're talking about, then yes, it looks like TensorFlow is winning. Although there's no "official" data as of yet, analyzing sources such as StackOverflow and Github seems to point towards a landslide victory for TensorFlow. If Stackoverflow posts are any indication, TensorFlow is clearly leading the race for deep learning framework adoption. Image: Delip Rao But perhaps the real question would be "why are people using TensorFlow" -- what are the criteria for choosing a DL framework? And, by extension, how does Caffe2 compare, and why would someone pick this over TensorFlow or other options such as Torch (in which Facebook is also heavily involved in), H2O.ai, DeepLearning4J, or Microsoft's CNTK? Yangqing Jia, research scientist in Facebook's Applied Machine Learning group and Caffe2 project lead, says: "Caffe2 is deployed at Facebook to help developers and researchers train large machine learning models and deliver AI-powered experiences in various mobile apps, like style transfer. One great feature of Caffe2 is its flexibility to perform a number of deep learning tasks, so it's easy to customize for specific workloads. We've run Caffe2 on our Big Basin GPU servers and Yosemite CPU servers, both of which are available through the Open Compute Project. We encourage people to use Caffe2 because of its high performance and first-class support for large-scale distributed training, mobile deployment, new hardware support (in addition to CPU and CUDA), and flexibility for future applications such as quantized computation." So the emphasis is on performance and flexibility. While performance may seem more straightforward (spoiler alert: it's not), what about flexibility? Jia goes as far as to hint Caffe2 will be quantum-computing ready. This claim may be difficult to assess today, but hardware support and programming language support are fairly tangible aspects of flexibility. Facebook previously embraced criticism towards Caffe and pointed towards Torch, but the release of Caffe2 may signify a change in course. Facebook worked closely with Nvidia, Qualcomm, Intel, Amazon, and Microsoft to optimize Caffe2 for both cloud and mobile environments. But as many examples have aptly demonstrated, technical merit alone does not always ensure market domination. Winning hearts and minds The role of developers is paramount in creating ecosystems, so winning their hearts and minds is essential for winning the battle for DL framework domination. Ease of use and comprehensive documentation and training are key parts of this, and Google has been trying to address this for TensorFlow -- although not always successfully. Facebook gets this, and that's the reason it's providing internal DL courses. Its employees also get this, and that's the reason these courses are oversubscribed. But internal courses are not enough obviously, so Caffe2 and the partnership with Nvidia is another way for Facebook to address this. Nvidia runs the Deep Learning Institute (DLI), through which it helps developers learn to use frameworks to design, train, and deploy neural network-powered machine learning for a variety of intelligent applications and services. Starting at Nvidia's GPU Technology Conference on May 8-11, Nvidia is adding Caffe2 training to the DLI curriculum. Members of the DLI team will be on hand to help developers get their hands dirty with Caffe2 through a self-paced lab. At the GPU Technology Conference in March last year Nvidia shared this graph showing the rapid growth in organizations engaged in deep learning. Image: Nvidia No hype, just fact: Artificial intelligence in simple business terms AI has become one of the great, meaningless buzzwords of our time. In this video, the Chief Data Scientist of Dun and Bradstreet explains AI in clear business terms. Read More Will Ramey, Nvidia director of developer programs, comments: "When we first started offering DL training, most of the interest came from universities and academic researchers. Now we're seeing a significant surge in both interest and adoption of DL in companies, across a wide range of application domains. Last year alone DLI trained more than 10,000 developers, data scientists, and researchers worldwide through online labs and instructor-led workshops. What we've learned is that the best way for developers to get started with DL is through hands-on experience. That's why our DLI training includes interactive projects the help you learn by actually applying DL to solve challenging problems in healthcare, autonomous driving, robotics, and other industries. We give developers the skills and experience they need using the latest deep learning frameworks and powerful GPU-accelerated workstations in the cloud, so you can learn how to create deep learning applications without having to purchase or setup a new development system." Deep Learning at scale everywhere The need to purchase new development systems is a common concern with DL. In Nvidia's announcement of Caffe2 there was particular emphasis on AI applications for edge devices. At the same time however, it seems like the focus of Caffe2 is on GPUs running on servers like Big Basin, so nowhere near the edge or the capabilities of edge devices. Nvidia emphasizes Caffe2 performance on GPUs, as far as training is concerned. But performance overall is hard to measure and compare. Image: Nvidia When asked to clarify this somewhat confusing verbiage, and to explain whether there is something about Caffe2 that makes it particularly suitable for developing AI apps for edge devices, Ramey replied as follows: "Caffe2 was designed to support the deep learning AI workflow from end-to-end. Its modular, lightweight framework can take full advantage of large scale GPU servers as well as run efficiently on lower powered embedded edge devices. Caffe2 uses the Nvidia Deep Learning SDK libraries, which are performance-optimized for all Nvidia GPU platforms ranging from Facebook's high-performance Big Basin servers and the Nvidia DGX-1 supercomputer, to energy efficient low-powered embedded devices such as the Nvidia Jetson TX2 which powers smart cameras, robots, drones, and more." Intel from its side highlights something different in its Caffe2 announcement: "Most deep learning workloads consist of both training and inference. Training usually requires many hours or days to complete. Inference usually requires milliseconds or seconds and is often a step of a larger process. While the computing intensity of inference is much lower than that of training, inference is often done on a much larger dataset. Therefore, the total computing resources spent on inference are likely to dwarf those spent on training. The overwhelming majority of all inference workloads run on Intel Xeon CPUs." The takeaway is that measuring DL performance is complicated. There is the training and the inference part, and then there are different scenarios and hardware that each of these may be running on. Caffe2 has gone to some lengths to get its bases covered in all of those, but although it highlights its improvement over its previous versions, measuring performance against the competition is rather hard. "All frameworks are more or less at a similar scalability factor,"says Jia. "We're pretty confident that Caffe2 is probably a little bit better than the rest." So the jury is not out on what the most scalable DL framework out there is. Scalability is a key feature, but it may not be the deciding factor on who wins the DL framework battle. Google seems to have a head start with TensorFlow. Still, this is too important, and it's too early for others to just roll over.

Social media companies such as YouTube should be fined if they fail to remove illegal content on their platforms such as child pornography, an influential committee of British MPs has said. “Social media companies currently face almost no penalties for failing to remove illegal content,” a report published Monday by the House of Commons Home Affairs Select Committee said. “We recommend that the government consult on a system of escalating sanctions to include meaningful fines for social media companies which fail to remove illegal content within a strict timeframe,” it continued. The report slammed companies for “outsourcing” some of the monitoring of their platforms to taxpayer-funded bodies: “In the U.K., the Metropolitan Police’s Counter Terrorism Internet Referral Unit (CTIRU) monitors social media companies for terrorist material,” the report said. “That means that multi-billion pound companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter are expecting the taxpayer to bear the costs of keeping their platforms and brand reputations clean of extremism,” it added. The report also tackles the failure by social media companies to remove terrorist and extremist material. “The weakness and delays in Google’s response to our reports of illegal neo-Nazi propaganda on YouTube were dreadful,” it said, “Despite us consistently reporting the presence of videos promoting National Action, a proscribed far-right group, examples of this material can still be found simply by searching for the name of that organisation.” “We recommend that all social media companies introduce clear and well-funded arrangements for proactively identifying and removing illegal content—particularly dangerous terrorist content or material related to online child abuse,” the report concluded. A YouTube spokesperson told Newsweek via email: “We take this issue very seriously. We’ve recently tightened our advertising policies and enforcement; made algorithmic updates; and are expanding our partnerships with specialist organisations working in this field. We’ll continue to work hard to tackle these challenging and complex problems." Nick Pickles, Twitter's U.K. Head of Public Policy, said via email: “Our Rules clearly stipulate that we do not tolerate hateful conduct and abuse on Twitter. As well as taking action on accounts when they're reported to us by users, we've significantly expanded the scale of our efforts across a number of key areas. “From introducing a range of brand new tools to combat abuse, to expanding and retraining our support teams, we're moving at pace and tracking our progress in real-time. We're also investing heavily in our technology in order to remove accounts who deliberately misuse our platform for the sole purpose of abusing or harassing others. It's important to note this is an ongoing process as we listen to the direct feedback of our users and move quickly in the pursuit of our mission to improve Twitter for everyone,” he continued. Newsweek has contacted Facebook for a comment. The inquiry into hate speech online was prompted by the murder of Jo Cox, the Labour Party MP killed by a far-right extremist called Thomas Mair during the Brexit campaign. The committee also heard evidence relating to Islamophobia, misogyny, far-right extremism, the role of social media in hate crime and the particular issues faced by members of parliament in relation to hate crime and its violent manifestations. The report did note some positive behavior by social networks: “We welcome the fact that YouTube, Facebook and Twitter all have clear community standards that go beyond the requirements of the law,” it said. “We strongly welcome the commitment that all three social media companies have to removing hate speech or graphically violent content, and their acceptance of their social responsibility towards their users and towards wider communities.” Go to MSN Home Go to MSN News Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

Join For Free Deploy and scale data-rich applications in minutes and with ease. Mesosphere DC/OS includes everything you need to elastically run containerized apps and data services in production. Google, Facebook, and Twitter own giant data centers all over the planet, and they are built with racks of commodity hardware. If thousands upon thousands of small servers networked together are good enough for Google, Facebook, and Twitter, then shouldn’t they be good enough for you? Perhaps you remember IBM’s famous commercial The servers, they stole all our servers! Consolidating all of that complexity into a mainframe might be just what you need. Let’s take a look at what the mainframe really is, and consider its use cases. Mainframe Workloads What do you use a mainframe for? Complex, data-intensive workloads, both batch and high-volume online transaction processing (OLTP). For example, banks do a lot of both. When customers access their accounts online that is OLTP. It is real-time and interactive. After hours banks typically run batch jobs: sending out customer statements, billing, daily totals, interest calculations, reminders, marketing emails, and reporting. This may mean processing terabytes of data in a short time, and that is what mainframes excel at. Health care, schools, government agencies, electric utilities, factory operations, enterprise resource planning, and delivering online entertainment are all good candidates for mainframes. The Internet of Things–PCs, laptops, smartphones, vehicles, security systems, “smart” appliances, and utility grids–are all well-served by mainframes. What Is a Mainframe? What exactly is a mainframe? Is it just a big computer? Is it the same as a supercomputer? The IBM z Systems servers dominate the mainframe market, owning over 90% of it; for the purposes of this discussion, we’ll say that a mainframe computer is an IBM z Systems server. Once upon a time the word “mainframe” described physical characteristics, a very large computer for handling very large workloads. A mainframe computer is distinctly different from the x86/ARM hardware we use every day. The modern IBM z Systems servers are much smaller than earlier mainframes, though they are still large. They are rugged, dependable, secure, and use the most advanced hardware. It may be helpful to think of the mainframe as a style of computing: centralized data storage and resource administration, high-demand mission-critical services, high security, high availability, robust hot-swap hardware, dynamic re-configuration of hardware and software with no downtime, massive transaction processing, backward-compatibility with older software, and massive throughput. There are multiple layers of redundancy for every component: power supplies, cooling, backup batteries, CPUs, I/O components, and cryptography modules. Mainframe’s Specialty Throughput is a distinct mainframe characteristic, as it supports large numbers of simultaneous transactions and massive I/O without slowing down. An x86/ARM server loses efficiency at >20% total load, and will slow down when any single component is overloaded; for example when its CPU is running at 100%, or memory is exhausted, or the hard disk thrashes. This doesn’t happen on a mainframe, which maintains peak performance up to 90% load. We can try to replicate this robust hardware in the x86/ARM server farm, but it’s not the same. Commodity hardware is always under intense downward price pressure, and on lower-end machines a lot of functionality is offloaded to software, such as encryption and networking, which places the load on the host CPU. In contrast, the mainframe is collection of specialized discrete components that supply their own resources. Networking interfaces, cryptographic processors, and device controllers have their own controllers, power supplies, redundant connectivity, self-diagnostics and reporting, and their own cooling systems. In-Box Communication All of that massive throughput and efficient resource utilization is enabled by in-box communications. The fastest x86/ARM cluster is limited by its network. Mainframe components communicate with each other via backplanes and thousands of specialized high-speed channels. The z Systems channel subsystem (CSS) controls all I/O operations, both internal and external. The CSS is comprised of hardware and firmware: the central processor complex (CPC), main system memory, and at least one control unit (CU). A control unit can be a standalone device, or integrated into an I/O device, the channel subsystem, or onboard the server. A single channel subsystem has multiple channel paths, and supports multiple logical partitions. Then there are multiple subchannel sets, each of which supports thousands of subchannels. All of those channels are managed dynamically to adjust to changes in workload, and to provide multiple paths for every operation. Flexible Resources Mainframe hardware resources are extremely configurable. A mainframe computer is divided into multiple smaller systems, which are called logical partitions or LPARs. Each LPAR runs its own operating system, and you can allocate memory and CPU very flexibly: shared, exclusively, or weighted for different circumstances. For example, the IBM z13 can manage up to 85 LPARs, which is like having 85 highly powerful servers in one box. Mainframes also support clustering. That’s right, you can cluster multiple mainframes just like x86/ARM servers. Mainframes have a high degree of high availability functionality built into their hardware and firmware. But clustering the individual instances offers additional advantages. The cluster stack provides hard consistency guarantees and coordinates access to shared resources. This is used by cluster-concurrent file systems such as OCFS2 and GFS2. It not only protects against hardware failures but also monitors the software and initiates recovery accordingly through restarts of the services or rebooting the instance. Geographically-dispersed clusters protect against disasters. Linux features one of the most advanced, comprehensive and fully open source high-availability cluster stacks which runs also on IBM z Systems. Is a mainframe a supercomputer? No.  A mainframe and a supercomputer are built for completely different purposes: typically a supercomputer is tuned for maximum processing power and speed, and it excels at CPU-intensive tasks. The operative words for mainframes are throughput, reliability, and rapid processing of extremely large data sets. Pets and Cattle The server farm uses virtualization, containers, and cloud technologies to abstract the datacenter as a single pool of resources, in an extremely complex way, with hundreds or thousands of individual components to manage and monitor, and to replace on a regular basis. Perhaps you are familiar with the “cattle, not pets” metaphor. In the container-based server farm everything is disposable. If a process fails then start a new one. If a hardware component fails replace it, and work around the failure with some kind of automatic failover that transfers its workload to a different component. You don’t nurture your individual pieces like pets, but treat them like herds of cattle, a faceless mass of disposable units. Docker, Apache Mesos, Marathon, ZooKeeper, Chef, Puppet, DC/OS, etc., all of these new technologies enable amazingly flexible service development and delivery, at the cost of an extremely complex system that is burdened with mitigating regular failures. Containers, Microservices, Virtualization Virtual machines, containers, and microservices are not exclusive to the x86/ARM server farm. A mainframe supports thousands of virtual machines, and supports all of your favorite software. You can run Linux natively on the z mainframes, but most installations run virtualized on z/VM, IBM’s hypervisor technology, as the base operating system, and z/OS (IBM’s proprietary operating system) or Linux in virtual machines. The VMs are connected to a high-performance physical memory backplane, which makes intra-VM communication very fast. For Linux-savvy system administrators, virtualization on IBM z Systems servers is getting even easier with KVM, the Linux-native virtualization technology. IBM offered their own version of KVM for IBM z Systems, and SUSE recently announced full KVM support for IBM z Systems with their SLES12 SP2 product version. Cloud technologies offer even more flexibility and rapid re-configuration of resources. z/VM supports OpenStack, the popular open source cloud stack which provides Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). You could use a mainframe as the hub of your operations, and add additional capacity with x86/ARM servers and public clouds. Hands-on Mainframe Experience? Commodity hardware is cheap and easy, and if you are using open source software you can set up a test lab for the cost of the hardware. Then you can try it out and build your skills. A mainframe is not so easy, and definitely not a do-it-yourself project. You can’t order one from Amazon or Newegg, and it has specialized power and cooling requirements. (Though due to its size and complexity, the server farm has more complicated environmental requirements.) The mainframe itself is still large and heavy. The smallest IBM mainframe, the z13s, weighs around a ton, and is the size of a large restaurant refrigerator. While Linux, and whatever software you want to run in your VMs is the same everywhere, there is a learning curve to administering the mainframe hardware and running z operating systems. The mainframe itself is blind and dumb, so you need support elements, which is a fancy name for laptops that are directly-connected, and you need a separate storage server. There are a few ways to try out mainframe technologies. IBM’s LinuxONE Community Cloud offers a 120-day free trial to test installing and provisioning SUSE, Red Hat, and lately also Ubuntu Linux on a z Systems server. The drawback: this service does not provide the capability to install Linux in a bare metal environment, or in a virtual machine, nor does it provide for any access to hardware management. You can also test a z server by arranging for a Proof of Concept trial. Loaner hardware is installed at your site. Obviously this is not a trivial exercise, and this is done only when there is a very good possibility that the customer will buy the installed hardware and software. As a qualified IBM PartnerWorld Independent Software Vendor (ISV), you can check out the IBM System z® Personal Development Tool (zPDT). It enables ISVs to develop software for IBM z Systems without the need for the hardware. The zPDT technology creates a z Systems architecture environment allowing mainframe operating systems (including Linux), middleware, and software to run unaltered on x86-compatible platforms. Getting Started Mainframe prices start at around $40,000 for an entry-level system. Pricing is based on CPU cores, hardware provisioning, and software licenses, and big systems can easily run over a million dollars. IBM publishes a wealth of Redbooks, videos, and good technical documentation. This is a great starting point for learning about mainframes and Linux on IBM z Systems.

Now anyone can create a Google Classroom Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/27 6:45am PDTApr 27, 2017 67 Plus 1 on G+ 145 Share on Facebook 84 Share on Twitter Total Shares296 Applications Downloads News Last month it was announced that Google Classroom would be opened up to anyone with a Google account — the collaboration tool for education was limited to those with a G Suite account, previously. That change meant that normal users could join classrooms, but now Google is expanding the functionality and allowing anyone to create and manage classrooms, too. According to Google's blog, The Keyword, teachers and students have been testing this new feature for the past few weeks. Google points to 3 specific use cases in its post. The first is an adult course on graphic design using Google Drawings (a good opportunity for cross-promotion there). The second involves after school programs, in this instance a girl scout group dedicated to building robots. And lastly, it talks about a student-run club intended to bring together those wanting to discuss design, art, and programming. It looks like it would be perfect for various adult education programs not affiliated with a school and it's great to see Google making these types of educational resources available to more and more people. To give it a try download the app below or take a look online. Source: The Keyword Download QR-Code Google Classroom Developer: Google Inc.

Grey Hopefully this means more things will be coming to all users from G-Suite. I'm talking about the new Hangouts. Plain Hangouts both badly needs modern features and is only modern features away from being recommendable to everyone. Plus instead of simply playing catch-up it adds new and interesting features and connectivity to other Google apps - plus a sweet video call meeting feature that everyone could take advantage of. It's a no brainer. I hope they announce it next month. Drakenoid That is genius!! Google should make enterprise features and release them to everyone else! People like their gsuite apps as it is! Derik Taylor This could be interesting. I have been considering getting with a group of people for study days for various topics, but have no idea how Google Classroom works. Interested to try it out. NunjaBusiness "or take a look online, to see if there's anything interesting you'd like to learn." Umm, yeah, the first thing I'd like to learn is how to find a list of classes available. You didn't seem to manage to do that in your little write-up. Fargo_Zoidberg Angry! Scott Scrivens Good point, it doesn't work like that. You need a classroom code to join a specific one.There is no list. I've updated the article accordingly. NunjaBusiness Well then, WTF is the point in promoting it at all to the public? Midnitte Seems like it could be useful for MOOCs Pedro Majano I think this kind of topic does not belong to an android blog... unless all of your target audience has GSuite for Education and are Teachers and Admin console users... Just saying. But lets see the comments. Zouz Dude, it's available to anyone with a simple Gmail account, did you read the article ? Pedro Majano LOL marcusmarcus2 Also, the article has a link to the playstore for the android app for this. So yeah, completely reasonable to be in an Android blog. Pedro Majano I could swear i saw "Not" instead of "Now", but I got coffee now, sorry bout that! 4Ui812 Now anyone can show Google how to properly check for software bugs prior to release.

I don't think too many users who are not teachers will want to use it, but I bet there are some user case scenarios that it would be useful for. Sergio Schickler Inaccurate article. Just tried to signup with my GSuite Work (personal, US based) and it clearly states it is only available for GSuite for Education.

The committee launched an inquiry into hate crimes, hate speech and the rise of extremism online following the murder of Jo Cox MP in the lead-up to the Brexit referendum last June. Tech giants such as Google, Facebook and YouTube were all interviewed as part of the investigation into online extremism and its proliferation throughout social media. The paper concluded that the social media companies also profit from failing to protect users effectively. “There may be some lasting financial implications for Google’s advertising division from this episode,” the committee bluntly states. Google’s search engine revamp to stifle ‘fake news’ & offensive websites https://t.co/k3WLWWJmIApic.twitter.com/ejt3728S5f— RT (@RT_com) April 26, 2017 The report heavily criticized Google for discrepancies within its own policies and the failure to effectively enforce them. The report says Google is incredibly efficient at enforcing copyright rules but is bizarrely inept at moderating extremist, hateful or illegal content to anywhere near the same extent, even after the committee itself raised multiple specific examples throughout its investigation. In addition, the inquiry alleged that Google was directly reaping “substantial profits from hosting dangerous and illegal content.” “One of the world’s largest companies has profited from hatred and has allowed itself to be a platform from which extremists have generated revenue,” the report stated. Google’s fake news fact-checkers mired in bias, controversy https://t.co/FVTQKAnK91— RT (@RT_com) April 8, 2017 The committee also referred to the Metropolitan Police’s Counter Terrorism Internet Referral Unit (CTIRU), which is responsible for monitoring social media for hate speech and extremist content in the UK. The group considers this as outsourcing a major compliance and security department of these corporations to the British government free of charge. “Google, Facebook and Twitter are expecting the taxpayer to bear the costs of keeping their platforms and brand reputations clean of extremism.” The Home Affairs Committee also claims that Prime Minister Theresa May’s call on 18 April for a general election has hampered its work and prevented it from establishing clear guidelines to combat the issue of hate speech. UK has one of highest anti-Semitic offense rates in world – Israeli watchdoghttps://t.co/lpBCgg8WiW— RT UK (@RTUKnews) April 24, 2017 It made several recommendations which it hopes will be implemented once a new Parliament is formed in June. “We recommend that the Government consult on a system of escalating [financial] sanctions to include meaningful fines for social media companies which fail to remove illegal content within a strict timeframe.” The committee also called for quarterly reports from social media companies elaborating on the specific number of instances of hate crimes that occur on their platforms as well as more transparency in terms of the measures they implement to combat the proliferation of “illegal and dangerous content.” In April, the German government approved plans to fine social media companies up to €50 million ($53 million) for failing to remove hateful or illegal content in a timely manner. “It is the wrong approach to make social networks into a content police,” said the head of the Digital Society Association consumer group, Volker Tripp, as cited by Reuters.

Dismiss Notice Business How Google, Facebook Lost $100 Million To Scammers Discussion in 'Business News' started by RemmyAlex, May 1, 2017 at 4:17 PM. Views count: 492 Tags: evaldas rimasauskas facebook and google lose fund to scammer us department of justice us-based internet companies RemmyAlex Social Member Curators Google and Facebook have confirmed that they fell victim to an alleged $100m (£77m) scam. In March, it was reported that a Lithuanian man had been charged over an email phishing attack against "two US-based internet companies" that were not named at the time. They had allegedly been tricked into wiring more than $100m to the alleged scammer's bank accounts. On 27 April, Fortune reported that the two victims were Facebook and Google. The man accused of being behind the scam, Evaldas Rimasauskas, 48, allegedly posed as an Asia-based manufacturer and deceived the companies from at least 2013 until 2015. "Fraudulent phishing emails were sent to employees and agents of the victim companies, which regularly conducted multimillion-dollar transactions with [the Asian] company," the US Department of Justice (DOJ) said in March. These emails purported to be from employees of the Asia-based firm, the DOJ alleged, and were sent from email accounts designed to look like they had come from the company, but in fact had not. The DOJ also accused Mr Rimasauskas of forging invoices, contracts and letters "that falsely appeared to have been executed and signed by executives and agents of the victim companies". "We detected this fraud against our vendor management team and promptly alerted the authorities," a spokeswoman for Google said in a statement. "We recouped the funds and we're pleased this matter is resolved." However, the firm did not reveal how much money it had transferred and recouped. Nor did Facebook - but a spokeswoman said: "Facebook recovered the bulk of the funds shortly after the incident and has been cooperating with law enforcement in its investigation." - BBC   RemmyAlex, May 1, 2017 at 4:17 PM #1 Comments [You must log in or sign up to reply here.] Show Ignored Content Log in with Facebook Your name or email address: Do you already have an account?

SECURITY Google and Facebook Allegedly Duped in $100 Million Scam Here is how to protect yourself from becoming a victim to similar scams. By Joseph Steinberg Joseph Steinberg is a cybersecurity expert and entrepreneur. He is CEO of SecureMySocial, which recently brought to market the world's first system to warn people in real time if they are making inappropriate social media posts. He is also the inventor of several popular cybersecurity technologies, and the author of books and articles on information security and business-related topics. Full bio: www.JosephSteinberg.com @JosephSteinberg CEO, SecureMySocial@JosephSteinberg WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Google and Facebook were allegedly the victims (at least temporarily) of a $100-Million scam! What happened? Last month, the US Justice Department charged a Lithuanian man with stealing via email phishing and related techniques a combined whopping $100 Million from two then-unnamed large technology companies. Yesterday, Fortune revealed that the two firms were (as some in the field had suspected) Facebook and Google. The scam was quite sophisticated - yet simple. Starting in 2013, Evaldas Rimasauskas allegedly forged emails, invoices, and various other communications in order to impersonate a large Asia-based manufacturer with whom Facebook and Google regularly did business, and successfully tricked the legitimate companies into paying him for computer supplies. According to the Justice Department, Rimasauskas "was initially successful, acquiring over $100 million in proceeds that he wired to various bank accounts worldwide." Eventually, however, the firms caught on, and Rimasauskas's scam was terminated. Was the $100 Million recovered? While neither Facebook nor Google has revealed the extent of its losses or exactly how much of the stolen funds it has recovered, a spokesperson for Google stated that "We detected this fraud against our vendor management team and promptly alerted the authorities. We recouped the funds and we're pleased this matter is resolved." Likewise, a spokeswoman for Facebook claimed that the firm "recovered the bulk of the funds shortly after the incident and has been cooperating with law enforcement in its investigation." Who is the alleged criminal, and with exactly what is he charged? Rimasauskas is charged with one count of wire fraud and three counts of money laundering, each of which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison, and one count of aggravated identity theft, which carries a (mandatory) minimum sentence of two years in federal prison. Contrary to many folks' impressions of hackers, Rimasauskas, who lives in Vilnius, is 48 years old. He denies the allegations, and is fighting extradition proceedings in Lithuania. What lessons should you learn from this episode? Many big and small businesses with smart employees have fallen prey to phishing scams - do not think that you or your business is immune. Learn how to stay secure - for some tips, see my article: This Email Scam Just Caused $100 Million in Fraud - and, yes, that article is about an additional $100 Million lost to a phishing-type scam. Also, be wary of email scams related to taxes - there has been a big uptick in such scams recently. Like this column? Sign up to subscribe to email alerts and you'll never miss a post.

CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Have you ever wondered what it would be like to work in the upper echelons of Silicon Valley giants Google and Apple? Both are close-mouthed about their inner workings, and Google goes so far as to require that employees sign a wide-ranging confidentiality waiver that bars them from discussing any aspect of working at the company with anyone, or even publishing a novel about working at a Silicon Valley company without first letting the company review it. But in an interview at the recent Qualtrics Insight Summit, Kim Scott, the bestselling author of Radical Candor: Be a Kickass Boss Without Losing Your Humanity, reveals what it's really like to be an exec at Apple and Google. Before she became an author and CEO coach, Scott created the "Managing at Apple" course at Apple University, and before that, she led AdSense and YouTube at Google. Here are her observations about how the two workplaces differ: 1. Apple is all about control. You can see it very clearly in the way the company serves you lunch, Scott says. "If you go to lunch at Apple, the Caffe Macs (as Apple's eateries are called) make you these beautiful meals, fully composed, the starch with the protein with the vegetable, and they are elegantly served. It's like going to a really nice restaurant." And, like Apple products themselves, the food service is "vertically integrated," Scott says. For example, Caffe Macs contracts with its own fishermen. "They don't want to poison the brains of these people whose brains they are paying for," Scott says. And, of course, you have to pay for the food; it isn't free. Similarly, at both Google and Apple, employees routinely use bicycles to get where they're going, an extremely logical approach since the weather in Silicon Valley is usually beautiful, the campuses are spread out (Scott once found herself working two miles away from her immediate supervisor) and parking is extremely difficult. Both companies provide bikes for employees to use, and Apple's are all identical and beautiful: silver with a black seat and red bell. Bikes are hung neatly in bike rooms. 2. Google is all about inclusion. Compare that approach to Google's, where, Scott says, "There are no bike rooms. Bikes are everywhere. They're multicolored. A third of them are broken. But it's kind of fun and jolly." In the cafeterias, she adds, the food is free and tends towards the eclectic. "It's kind of like a smorgasbord," she says. "It's all delicious, all organic, all wonderful. But I'd wind up with a plate full of food and none of it quite went together." Which approach works better? There's no simple answer. "I love both companies," Scott says. "I'm probably more Googly in my heart of hearts than I am Apple. But I'd rather buy an iPhone than an Android phone, and I'd rather eat lunch at Apple than at Google." 3. At Google, the default answer is yes. The cafeterias and the bike rooms represent two very different approaches to innovation, Scott adds. "If you wanted to get something done at Google, you didn't have to ask permission. You would just start telling people you were doing it and start doing it. So there's sort of a consensus-based, fast-moving culture--which I would have said was impossible before I joined Google." It worked, she says, because Google has what she calls "a bias to yes." With that culture in place, "You could do something, and eventually if someone wanted to stop you they could exert the energy to stop you. In other words, you had to exert energy to stop someone from doing something. You didn't have to exert energy to start." That culture didn't arise by accident, Scott adds. It was likely the result of a frustrating summer job Google co-founder Larry Page once described to her. "His boss explained the project, and Larry had an idea to accomplish everything he was supposed to accomplish over the whole summer in something like half a day. And his boss said, 'No, no, no, you can't do it that way, you have to do it the way we've always done it.' And he was miserable and frustrated. We've all been there. He looked right at me and said, 'I never want anyone at Google to have that experience, ever.' And Google did a huge number of things to make sure there wasn't that sort of wing clipping." The fact that this culture remained as the company grew is a testament to Marissa Mayer's leadership, Scott says. "There was a point when the company was growing and, as she put it, the goalies had gotten too good. The naysayers were stopping things from happening and it was too hard to do stuff." And so Mayer made some changes. For instance, engineers were told they could run experiments on a certain percentage of users at will, without getting permission first. "Sometimes these experiments would have noticeable impacts on revenue," Scott says. "They drove Sales crazy! But it was very important as part of the culture." 4. At Apple, the default answer is no. But if they say yes, they give you everything you need to succeed. One of her Apple colleagues told Scott that, when new hires arrived, he would show them two folders, his "yes" folder and his "no" folder. The "yes" folder has about four pages in it; the "no" folder had thousands of pages in it. "And the name of the game at Apple was not to get discouraged by the nos and keep pushing," Scott says. Because, if you could persuade your boss and your boss's boss to say yes, "the resources flowed," she recalls. "When I got to Apple to design this class in managing, I was given five months to do nothing but design the class. If I had designed a managing class at Google, I wouldn't have been given a minute." (The company's legendary 20 percent time for your own projects existed in "the fantasy Google, not the real Google," she says.) At Google, she says, she probably would have wound up designing the class between 10 pm and 3 am on the night before she gave it, she says. "Apple cleared my decks and didn't ask me to do anything but design this class. That was amazing. You were expected to go deep and perfect things." That experience served her well when she set out to write Radical Candor, she adds. "I think my instinct is much more like Google--launch and then iterate. But I couldn't have finished the book if I hadn't worked at Apple. I learned a lot about the value of wrestling with one word for weeks at a time. I really does make a difference."

Content marketing engages and delivers real value to the users, and can put you on the map, putting your brand in front of far more eyeballs than fixing a canonical tag ever could. While content is at the heart of everything we do, there is a danger that ignoring a site’s technical set-up and diving straight into content creation will not deliver the required returns. Failure to properly audit and resolve technical concerns can disconnect your content efforts from the benefits it should be bringing to your website. The following eight issues need to be considered before committing to any major campaign: 1. Not hosting valuable content on the main site For whatever reason, websites often choose to host their best content off the main website, either in subdomains or separate sites altogether. Normally this is because it is deemed easier from a development perspective. The problem with this? It’s simple. If content is not in your main site’s directory, Google won’t treat it as part of your main site. Any links acquired on subdomains will not be passed to the main site in the same way as if it was in a directory on the site. Sistrix posted this great case study on the job site Monster, who recently migrated two subdomains into their main site and saw an uplift of 116% visibility in the UK. The chart speaks for itself: We recently worked with a client who came to us with a thousand referring domains pointing towards a blog subdomain. This represented one third of their total referring domains. Can you imagine how much time and effort it would take to build one thousand referring domains? The cost of migrating content back into the main site is miniscule in comparison to earning links from one thousand referring domains, so the business case was simple, and the client saw a sizeable boost from this. 2. Not making use of internal links The best way to get Google to spider your content and pass equity between sections of the website is through internal links. I like to look at a website’s link equity as a heat which flows through the site through its internal links. Some pages are linked to more liberally and so are really hot; other pages are pretty cold, only getting heat from other sections of the site. Google will struggle to find and rank these cold pages, which massively limits their effectiveness. Let’s say you’ve created an awesome bit of functional content around one of the key pain points your customers experience. There’s loads of search volume in Google and your site already has a decent amount of authority so you expect to gain visibility for this immediately, but you publish the content and nothing happens! You’ve hosted your content in some cold directory miles away from anything that is regularly getting visits and it’s suffering as a result. This works both ways, of course. Say you have a page with lots of external links pointing to it, but no outbound internal links – this page will be red hot, but it’s hoarding the equity that could be used elsewhere on the site. Check out this awesome bit of content created about Bears Ears national park: Ignoring the fact this has broken rule No.1 and is on a subdomain, it’s pretty cool, right? Except they’ve only got a single link back to the main site, and it is buried in the credits at the bottom of the page. Why couldn’t they have made the logo a link back to the main site? You’re probably going to have lots of pages on content which are great magnets for links, but what is more than likely is that these are probably not your key commercial pages. You want to ensure relevant links are included between hot pages and key pages. One final example of this is the failure to break up paginated content with category or tag pages. At Zazzle Media we’ve got a massive blog section which, at the time of writing, has 49 pages of paginated content! Link equity is not going to be passed through 49 paginated pages to historic blog posts. To get around this we included links to our blog posts from our author pages which are linked to from a page in the main navigation: This change allows our blog posts to be within three clicks of the homepage, thus getting passed vital link equity. Another way around this would be with the additional tag or category pages for the blog – just make sure these pages do not cannibalize other sections of the site! 3. Poor crawl efficiency Crawl efficiency is a massive issue we see all the time, especially with larger sites. Essentially Google only has a limited amount of pages it will crawl on your site at any one time. Once it has exhausted its budget it will move on and return at a later date. If your website has an unreasonably large amount of URLs then Google may get stuck crawling unimportant areas of your website, while failing to index new content quickly enough. The most common cause of this is an unreasonably large number of query parameters being crawlable. You might see the following parameters working on your website: https://www.example.com/dresses https://www.example.com/dresses?category=maxi https://www.example.com/dresses?category=maxi&colour=blue https://www.example.com/dresses?category=maxi&size=8&colour=blue Functioning parameters are rarely search friendly. Creating hundreds of variations of a single URL for engines to crawl individually is one big crawl budget black hole. River Island’s faceted navigation creates a unique parameter for every combination of buttons you can click: This creates thousands of different URLs for each category on the site. While they have implemented canonical tags to specify which pages they want in the index, this does not specify which pages are to be crawled, and much of their crawl budget will be wasted on this. Google have released their own guidelines on how to properly implement faceted navigation, which is certainly worth a read. As a rule of thumb though, we recommend blocking these parameters from being crawled, either through marking the links themselves with a nofollow attribute, or using the robots.txt or the parameter tool within Google Search Console. All priority pages should be linked to elsewhere anyway, not just the faceted navigation. River Island have already done this part: Another common cause of crawl inefficiency arises from having multiple versions of the website accessible, for example: https://www.example.com http://www.example.com https://example.com http://example.com Even if the canonical tag specifies the first URL as our default, this isn’t going to stop search engines from crawling other versions of the site if they are accessible. This is certainly pertinent if other versions of the site have a lot of backlinks. Keeping all versions of the site accessible can make four versions of a page crawlable, which will kill your crawl budget. Rule redirects should be setup to redirect any request and the non-canonicalization version of the page to 301 redirect to the preferred version in a single step. One final example of wasted crawl efficiency is broken or redirected internal links. We once had a client query the amount of time it was taking for content in a certain directory to get indexed. From crawling the directory, we realised instantly that every single internal link within the directory was pointing to a version of the page not appended with a trailing slash, and then a redirect was forcing the trailing slash on. Essentially for every link followed, two pages were requested. While broken and redirected internal links are not a massive priority for most sites, as the resource required to fix them does not outweigh the benefit, it is certainly worth resolving priority issues (such as issues from links within the main navigation, or in our case entire directories of redirecting links) especially if you have a problem with the speed with which your content is being indexed. Just imagine if your site had all three issues! Infinite functioning parameters on four separate sites, all with double the amount of pages requested! 4. Large amounts of thin content In the post Google Panda world we live in, this really is a no brainer. If your website has large amounts of thin content pages, then sprucing up one page on your website with 10x better content is not going to be sufficient to hide the deficiencies your website already has. The Panda algorithm essentially makes a score of your website based upon the amount of unique, valuable content you have. Should the majority of the pages not meet the minimum score required to be deemed valuable, your rankings will plummet. While everyone wants the next big viral idea on their website, when doing our initial content audit, it’s more important to look at the current content on the site and ask the following questions: Is it valuable? Is is performing? If not, can it be improved to serve a need? Removal of content may be required for pages which cannot be improved. Content hygiene is more important initially than the “big hero” ideas, which come at a later point within the relationship.

How to use Search Console for quick SEO wins 5. Large amounts of content with overlaps in keyword targeting We still see websites making this mistake in 2017. For example, if our main keyword is blue widgets and is being targeted on a service page, we might want to make a blog post about blue widgets too! Because it’s on our main service offering, let’s put a blurb on our homepage about blue widgets. Oh, and of course, you also have a features of our blue widgets page. No! Just stop, please! The rule of one keyword per page has been around for nearly as long as SEO, but we still see this mistake being made. You should have one master hub page which contains all the top line information about the topic your keyword is referencing. You should only utilize other pages should there be significant search volume around long tail variations of the term, and on these pages target the long tail keyword and the long tail keyword only. Then link prominently between your main topic page and your long-tail pages. If you have any additional pages which do not provide any search benefit, such as a features page, then consider consolidating the content onto the hub page, or preventing this page from being indexed with a meta robots noindex attribute. So, for example, we’ve got our main blue widgets page, and from it we link out to a blog post on the topic of why blue widgets are better than red widgets. Our blue widgets feature page has been removed from the index and the homepage has been de-optimized for the term. 6. Lack of website authority But content marketing helps attract authority naturally, you say! Yes, this is 100% true, but not all types of content marketing do. At Zazzle Media, we’ve found the best ROI on content creation is the evergreen, functioning content which fulfils search intent. When we take a new client on board we do a massive keyword research project which identifies every possible long tail search around the client’s products and services. This gives us more than enough content ideas to go about bringing in at the top of the funnel traffic that we can then try to strategically push down the funnel through the creative use of other channels. The great thing about this tactic is that it requires no promotion. Once it becomes visible in search, it brings in traffic regularly without any additional budget. One consideration before undergoing this tactic is the amount of authority a website already has. Without a level of authority, it is very difficult to get a web page to rank for anything well, no matter the content. Links still matter in 2017. While brand relevancy is the new No.1 ranking factor (certainly for highly competitive niches), links are still very much No. 2. Without an authoritative website, you may have to step back from creating informational content for search intent, and instead focus on more link-bait types of content. 7. Lack of Data Without data it is impossible to make an informed decision about the success of your campaigns. We use a wealth of data to make informed decisions prior to creating any piece of content, then use a wealth of data to measure our performance against those goals. Content needs to be consumed and shared, customers retained and engaged. Keyword tools like Storybase will provide loads of long tail keywords with which to base your content on. Ahrefs content explorer can help validate content ideas by comparing the performance of similar ideas. I love also using Facebook page insights on custom audiences (by website traffic or email list) to extract vital information about our customer demographic. Then there is Google Analytics. Returning visits, pages per session, measure customer retention. Time on page, exit rate and social shares can measure the success of the content. Number of new users and bounce rate is a good indication of the engagement of new users. If you’re not tracking the above metrics you might be pursuing a method which simply does not work. What’s worse, how can you build on your past successes? 8. Slow page load times This one is a no brainer. Amazon estimated that a single second increase to their page load times would cost them $1.6 billion in sales. Google have published videos, documents and tools to help webmasters address page load issues. I see poor page load times as a symptom of a much wider problem; that the website in question clearly hasn’t considered the user at all. Why else would they neglect probably the biggest usability factor? These websites typically tend to be clunky, have little value and what content they do have is hopelessly self-serving. Striving to resolve page speed issues is a commitment to improving the experience a user has of your website. This kind of mentality is crucial if you want to build an engaged user base. Some, if not all, of these topics justify their own blog post. The overriding message from this post is about maximising a return of investment for your efforts. Everyone wants the big bang idea, but most aren’t ready for it yet. Technical SEO should be working hand in hand with content marketing efforts, letting you eke out the maximum ROI your content deserves. Tom Smith is a Search and Data Consultant at Zazzle Media.

How to optimize for voice search Inspired by a recent presentation at SMX West, columnist Sherry Bonelli discusses why small businesses and local search marketers need to be thinking about voice search. Sherry Bonelli on May 1, 2017 at 10:32 am More dennizn / Shutterstock.com The way people search for information online is changing. Increasingly, people are using voice search on their smartphones, tablets or voice assistants (like the Amazon Echo or Google Home devices) to search for information on the internet. Siri is your best friend if you’re using an Apple device, Google voice search is popular on Android devices and Microsoft’s Cortana is useful on your PC and smartphone using their app: According to Hitwise, nearly 60 percent of searches are now performed on a mobile device. With more and more people using mobile devices to search, people often find it’s easier to use their voice to search instead of typing on tiny screens. This means SEO professionals need to start thinking about content and SEO differently. Searching by voice is a hot topic among forward-thinking SEO professionals. At SMX West 2017 last month, Benu Aggarwal had a popular session on the subject, “Optimizing Content for Voice Search and Virtual Assistants.” During that session, she gave some great tips on how SEOs can start thinking and planning for a different type of search strategy for voice searches. A new world for search Mobile devices, smartphones and smart home devices featuring digital assistants like Siri, Cortana, Alexa and Google Assistant are invading our lives. These new voice devices and technology make it easier than ever for people to simply ask a question and get information from their device. This allows for a more natural way to interact with machines using a conversational voice. Using your voice, you can now play music, turn on your lights, search for a local pizza restaurant, order products and get information on everything from breaking news to the weather. And interconnectivity between various devices is an interesting part of voice search technology. For instance, a Google Home tip can even show up on your desktop, giving you advice on how you can best use your Google Home voice assistant: During her SMX West presentation, Aggarwal shared the follow stats: This slide shows the importance of mobile and local search. But how might voice search factor in? According to the 2016 Internet Trends Report, voice search is rapidly gaining market share: In 2015, 1.7 million voice-first devices were shipped. In 2016, that number increased to 6.5 million devices. VoiceLabs predicts that in 2017, 24.5 million voice-first devices will be shipped. The big question for SEO professionals is: How do you create a content and SEO strategy for this new way to search? How to optimize for voice search Since search engines were first introduced to the mainstream in the mid-1990s, users have learned how to succinctly enter keyword phrases to find information on the internet using a PC. Unlike search keyword phrases that you type into your computer, voice search is more conversational and natural in tone. Voice search is also typically mobile and often locally focused. For example, when I traveled to San Jose for SMX West, my smartphone knew where I was physically located. So when I searched for a restaurant, my phone anticipated where I was (not in Cedar Rapids, Iowa), and the search results for restaurants were all in San Jose. Because they’re more conversational, voice search queries are also usually longer than typical text keyword search queries. Image Credit: Purna Virji, citing Bing data It’s important to remember that the whole purpose of these new technologies is for the device to provide the best results for on-the-go searchers. To do this, the devices try to find easily identifiable, short and relevant pieces of content to serve back to the searcher. Here are some tips that can help you optimize for voice search. What are people searching for? According to the Internet Trends Report 2016, people are using voice search for a variety of searches. With an estimated 22 percent searching for local content and information, local businesses (and agencies that do local SEO) need to start strategizing for local voice search. Claim your Google My Business listing If you haven’t claimed your Google My Business listing yet, what are you waiting for? It’s time! Claiming and optimizing Google My Business is a great way for Google to find out more information about your business, like the category of business you’re in, your address, phone number, business hours and more. Since many voice searches are local in nature, having your Google My Business listing claimed and up-to-date can help increase your chances of showing up when a voice search is done pertaining to your local business, location or business category. Conversational keywords Now keywords are no longer just keywords. Keywords in the voice search world are long-tail+. The “plus” refers to the conversational phrases that you need to add when optimizing for conversational voice search. Your keyword strategy must now be more conversational in nature and mimic how real people talk and ask questions verbally. Start thinking about the types of questions you get when customers call you on the phone to ask questions about your business, then start documenting and recording the exact words they use when they talk to your customer service representatives. Once you have a list of questions and statements your customers give you over the phone, you can then start creating content pages that focus on those longer, more conversational search terms. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) pages A great way to use the aforementioned customer data is to create FAQ pages that focus on those long-tail+ conversational keyword phrases. Try to group common questions on the same page. Go for natural-sounding questions and phrases instead of the old SEO-keyword phrases you’re probably used to using. If you need to create several different pages so that the voice search technologies have a better chance of pulling information from your site, go for it! Also, anticipate more direct questions from searchers. Searches like “best digital camera” will start to disappear, and hyper-specific searches will become more popular. Example: “Alexa, where can I find a waterproof video camera that works with Facebook Live?” Offer quick, succinct answers to questions that voice searchers are asking. It can seem like a daunting task, but creating these individual pages and snippets of content centered around specific semantic questions that people are asking can not only help your site show up in voice search results, it can also increase your chances of appearing in a Google “Featured Snippet.” Structured data markup Use structured data markup (applying the correct schemas) to give these voice search devices even more information about your site and content. Structured data markup from schema.org is crucial for your site, as it defines more specific information and makes it easier for search engines to accurately parse your content and understand its context. It’s a new world for SEO! Voice search is not going away. It’s time SEOs start optimizing their sites for this brave new world of voice search — so they’re not left behind.

When you get through security, the airport sends you on a ‘customer journey’ through duty free shopping whether you want to go shopping or not. The airport forces you to spend more time getting to your gate. The airport feels that it has delivered a great customer experience if you have wasted time and money on things you didn’t really need to buy.  That’s because the customer of the airport is not you. The ‘customer’ of the airport is the shop trying to sell you stuff. Imagine if Google Maps approached customer journey design the same way. A few months ago, I needed to get from San Jose to Sacramento. Being used to driving on the left, I was a bit nervous as I set off in my rental car. I was depending on Google Maps. Imagine if as I typed in “Sacramento” Google said: “How about going to San Francisco, instead? We’ve got great deals in San Francisco!” “No, thanks, Google!”  Or, imagine if halfway through the journey, Google maps told me to take the next exit. Then it gave me a series of directions and I ended up queuing at a McDonald’s drive-thru. Would I be having a great customer experience? Instead, Google regularly informed me that I was on the “fastest route.” At home, I have a very expensive navigation system in my car. I don’t use it. Through experience, I have found that Google has the fastest route. The fastest route is nearly always the best customer journey, the best customer experience. You can’t design a great customer experience if your business model is to exploit your customers. And that is the business model for a great many organizations: to sell their customers things they don’t really need at the highest possible prices. Customer experience is the experience the customer wants to have, not the experience the organization wants the customer to have. There are still lots of foolish customers, but there’s not as many of them as there used to be. The reason customer experience is now such a big issue is not because organizations have suddenly seen the light. It’s because customers have become much more powerful, much more informed and much less brand-loyal. The new digital competitors who are looking to challenge traditional banks, retailers, universities, etc. are all offering the following benefits over the old way of doing business: simplicity, convenience and value. Your complexity and high margins are your digital competitor’s opportunity. For a lot of traditional organizations, their profit lies in their complexity. The more complex they make things for the customer, the bigger the profit. Complexity creates dependence. Complexity feeds ignorance, which allows an opening for emotional manipulation. Governments and commercial organizations have thrived by creating ever more complex customer journeys. Profit for a government is measured based on its size and its control over its citizens. This is not necessarily a deliberate strategy, as it’s the most natural thing in the world to want to be bigger and more in control. Great customer journey design always begins with knowing the journey the customer wants to go on. That requires extensive research and a deep understanding of your customers. The best customer journey is the shortest route, the fastest time. About the Author Gerry McGovern is the founder and CEO of Customer Carewords.

New Atlas Lifestyle Science Technology Transport Search Subscribe Mobile Technology Samsung Galaxy S8+ vs. Google Pixel Emily Ferron May 1, 2017 Sizing up the Samsung Galaxy S8+ against the Google Pixel View gallery - 34 images If you're eyeing a high-end Android smartphone, you'll likely want to consider options from both the Samsung Galaxy S8 series and the Google Pixel flagships. Here, we compare the specs and features of the Galaxy S8+ and the Google Pixel. Size Sick of Ads? More than 700 New Atlas Plus subscribers read our newsletter and website without ads. Join them for just US$19 a year.More Information The S8+ is considerably larger than the Pixel. The S8+ is the bigger of Samsung's latest flagships, while the Pixel is the little brother to the Pixel XL. The relatively tall, narrow S8+ is 10-percent taller and 4-percent wider. Weight The S8+ is 17-percent heavier than the Pixel. Build Both builds use aluminum and glass, but to different effect. The S8+ has a rounded glass back that curves into a minimal aluminum frame. The Pixel has an aluminum body with the exception of a glass panel on the upper back. Colors The S8+ is available in five colors internationally, but in the US, only the black, silver and orchid gray variants are currently available. The Pixel comes in black, blue and silver. Water resistance The S8+ has an IP68 water resistance rating, but the Pixel is not similarly protected. Display size There's a whopping difference between the nearly edge-to-edge 6.2-inch display on the larger Samsung phone and the bezeled 5-incher on the Pixel. The S8+ packs in 29-percent more screen area. Display resolution Display resolution on the S8+ also beats that of the Pixel. QHD+ resolution is just one of the qualities that has earned Samsung's Infinity Display high praise from experts. Display type Both makers choose AMOLED display technology over IPS. HDR display The S8+ is certified Mobile HDR Premium by the UHD Alliance and can support HDR video content. No such luck on the Pixel. Curved display The S8+ display has rounded edges that curve around the edges of the phone. Like most phones, the Pixel is flat-fronted. Home button Both phones have onscreen home buttons. The home button in the Galaxy S8 series has some pressure sensitivity, so you can do a hard press to immediately go home even when the navigation buttons are faded out (in places like full-screen videos or games). Fingerprint sensor Both phones have back-mounted fingerprint sensors. The Pixel's is centered, but on the S8+, it is placed to the right of the camera lens and is harder to reach. Face recognition Samsung has lauded the S8 flagships' face recognition as a nearly instant biometric method for unlocking your phone. However, it doesn't seem to be the best way to keep your phone secure, and it doesn't seem that different from the Trusted Face feature already included in the Android operating system. Iris scanning Samsung does offer a more secure biometric method: iris scanning, which has been much improved since we first tested it in the ill-fated Note 7. Processor Samsung uses the latest Snapdragon 835 chip in the US and other markets and its own Exynos-branded chip elsewhere. Google used last year's Snapdragon 821 chip, which is still duly capable. RAM Both phones have 4 GB of RAM. Storage The S8+ is available in one 64 GB storage size, while the Pixel straddles that with 32 GB and 128 GB options. MicroSD Storage on the S8+ is expandable up to an extra 256 GB thanks to microSD. Headphone jack Don't worry, neither of these flagships followed in the path of the iPhone 7: The headphone jack remains intact. Bundled headphones … but only the S8+ actually includes headphones, an AKG pair that has a retail price of US$99 when sold separately. Battery The S8+ has a bigger battery, which makes sense, because it's a bigger phone. We'll see how it fares in our standard battery test in our full-length review. Fast charging Both phones offer some quick charge capability. Wireless charging Only the S8+ supports wireless charging (with a sold-separately charging pad) and even a degree of fast wireless charging. Camera megapixels Resolution in the front and rear cameras stands pat. Camera aperture (rear) The S8+ has a larger aperture (the smaller the f-stop, the larger the aperture) which, at least in theory, could translate into better depth of field effects and improved low light shooting. Optical image stabilization (OIS) The S8+ has OIS to combat hand shake-induced image blur, but not the Pixel (but to be fair, we don't miss it very much on this particular phone). Mobile payments Both phones have NFC technology to make payments with a swipe of your phone at participating retailers. Samsung Pay, on the S8+, has the added benefit of being able to mimic magnetic stripe cards as well. Voice assistant Both phones have Android's Google Assistant, but the S8 series also debuts Samsung's all-new Bixby virtual assistant. There's even a dedicated Bixby activation button on the side of the phone. However, not all Bixby features – including all-important voice control – have gone live yet. VR headset The S8+ supports the Samsung Gear VR, which currently has a better content library than the similarly capable Google Daydream View, which is compatible with the Pixel. Desktop PC dock With Samsung's DeX dock (sold separately) you can use the S8+ to power a desktop PC-like experience with a monitor, keyboard and mouse. Software Pixel runs pure Android Nougat, and as a Google device, it is first in line for software updates for the near future. The S8+ runs Nougat as well, but with Samsung's TouchWiz UI skinned on top, which will mean slower updates. Release The Pixels arrived on the scene late last year, but the S8 flagships are just starting to hit shelves. Starting price (full retail) Prices for the S8+ vary depending on carrier and payment plan, but expect to pay nearly $200 more than you would for the Pixel, which already carries a considerable $649 price tag. To read the kind of info you won't find on a spec sheet, check out our initial impressions of the Samsung Galaxy S8+ and our full-length review of the Google Pixel.

If you would like to disable "third party" cookies generated by advertisers or providers of targeted advertising services, you can turn them off by going to the third party's website and getting them to generate a one-time "no thanks" cookie that will stop any further cookies being written to your machine.

Join For Free Launching an app doesn’t need to be daunting. Whether you’re just getting started or need a refresher on mobile app testing best practices, this guide is your resource! Brought to you in partnership with Perfecto.  Fitness tracking in no longer a wave, instead it has become a base that keeps the world today over it. Its popularity in no time brought the two smartphone OS giants Apple and Google into the competition. While on one hand, Apple’s HealthKit is playing the Health Guru, on the other side it’s Google Fit. Each of them is claiming to deliver best in segment services. However, which of these is the best for you will indeed call for a close analysis. Before we move ahead to find which one’s better, let’s study them individually: Google Fit It originally entered as software designed to help hardware makers and fitness app developers to log and display health-related data with the least possible coding. However, right before the start of 2015 it left the labs of developers and became a dedicated consumer-focused offering. Since then Google Fit has evolved itself as a fully developed mobile app, which not only tracks your steps but also assists during gym sessions. HealthKit This also works in the same way as Google Fit. It accumulates all the data linked with your health and uses it further to give better health related suggestions. So, what’s the difference between Google Fit & Healthkit? Here are some key differences between the two: 1. Design Google Fit: It avails a user-friendly and simple design to the users. However, the glitch here is that the user will have to swipe the screen every time he/she wishes to access new information. To overcome this, the team ensured that user gets detailed information about his/her activities. Apart from this, users are also allowed to enter information manually. The interactive part here is the animated snippets, which come as a reward for users upon achieving a goal. HealthKit: The details are similar to the ones offered in Google Fit. However, there’s one inclusion which makes Apple stand a bit taller. We are talking about the feature with which users are allowed to compare their attained metrics on a single screen. With this, the users can have a better experience as they can access more information with much ease. 2. Security Google Fit: The data stored in the application can be shared with third party applications. However, before doing this the app requires user’s permission. HealthKit: The information stored in the application can be shared only by user’s permission, which makes Apple take a similar stand as Google. However, as an addition, the mobile applications which are built using HealthKit have the data stored in an encrypted format. 3. Types of data Google Fit: As shared officially, it covers the type of activity and time consumed, wheel speed, calories burned, distance covered, pedaling rate, weight, height, power generated in a workout, elevation, heart rate, and steps taken. The major point which comes out here is that Google Fit enables the applications to create their own customized data types. HealthKit: HealthKit in this point takes a lap ahead by adding blood alcohol level, glucose, diet, sleep analysis and more in its list. However, it doesn’t allow the app developers to customize data types according to their wish. By any means, they’ll have to stick with the official list. 4. Partners Google Fit: Adorned with an impressive list of partnerswhich includes Asus, Adidas, HTC, Fatsecret, Intel, Basis, LG, and more. HealthKit: Apple takes a step ahead by having health-focused partners also on the list. This includes EPIC software and Mayo Clinic. To name others, we have Fitbit, Withings, Runkeeper, and Nike on the list. Saying that HealthKit is ahead of Google Fit or vice-versa won’t be right. This solely depends on your choice. No doubts that both the platforms are in a way providing a better landscape to developers and users via better healthcare mobility solutions. The decision to choose one solely depends on your client base, app development budget, and the services/features you wish to avail. The healthcare and fitness app industry is growing rapidly. We can expect big changes in the coming time. Keeping this in mind, this is the right time to join the market and get a healthcare and fitness app developed before it's too late. Remember, the earlier you join the race, more are your chances to stay ahead. All you need is a well-planned and executed health mobile application.

While the tooling and infrastructure for building traditional web applications have been highly optimized over time, the same cannot be said for microservices. In particular, setting up a productive development environment for microservices can be considerably more complex than a traditional web application: Your service likely relies on resources like a database or a queue.In production, these will often be provided by your cloud provider, e.g., AWS RDS for databases or Google Pub/Sub for publish/subscribe messaging. Your service might rely on other services that either you or your coworkers maintain. For example, your service might rely on an authentication service. These external dependencies add complexity to creating and maintaining a development environment. How do you set up your service so you can code and test it productively when your service depends on other resources and services? This article discusses the various approaches to setting up a development environment, and the tradeoffs. Option #1: Spin Up the Full System Locally Using tools like Minikube or Docker Compose, you can spin up multiple services locally. For resources like databases you use Docker images that match them: For a database like PostgreSQL, you can use the postgres Docker image as a replacement for AWS RDS.It won’t quite match, but much of the time it will be close enough. For other cloud resources you can often spin up emulators; Google provides an emulator for Google Pub/Sub that you can run locally. If you’re unable to use containers, Daniel Bryant outlines a number of other approaches for developing microservices locally with various tradeoffs. Pros: Fast, local development. Cons: Some resources can be hard to emulate locally (e.g., Amazon Kinesis). You need a way to set up and run all your services locally and keep this setup in sync with how you run services in production. Not completely realistic. Depending on the option chosen, there can be major or minor differences from production, e.g., the postgres Docker image doesn’t quite match the AWS RDS PostgreSQL configuration, mocks/stubs are not a substitute for running a full-blown service. You potentially need to spin up the whole system locally, which will become difficult once you have a large enough number of services and resources. Option #2: Spin Up the Full System in the Cloud You spin up a realistic cluster in the cloud, a staging/testing environment. It might not have as many nodes as the production system since load will be much lower, but it is quite close. Your code also runs in this cluster. Pros: Very realistic. Cons: Development is slower since you need to push code to cloud after every change in order to try it out. Using tools like debuggers is more difficult since the code all runs remotely. Getting log data for development is considerably more complex. Need to pay for additional cloud resources, and spinning up new clusters and resources is slow (even if you use an automated tool). As a result, you may end up using a shared staging environment rather than one per-developer, which reduces isolation. Option #3: Spin Up All Business Logic Locally, Route Cloud Services to Laptop As with option #1, all services run locally. However, cloud resources (AWS RDS, etc.) are made available locally on your development machine via some sort of tunneling or proxying, e.g., a VPN. Pros: Fast, local development. Very realistic. Cons: You need a way to set up and run all your services locally and keep this setup in sync with how you run services in production. Need to pay for additional cloud resources, and spinning up new cloud resources is slow. As a result, you may end up using a shared staging environment rather than one per-developer, which reduces developer isolation. You potentially need to spin up the whole system locally, which will become difficult once you have a large enough number of services. Option #4: Make Local Code for Single Service Available in Remote Cluster You spin up a realistic cluster in the cloud, a staging/testing environment, but your service runs locally and is proxied/VPNed into the remote cluster. Pros: Fast, local development. Very realistic. Simple local setup. Cons: Need to pay for additional cloud resources, and spinning up new cloud resources is slow. As a result, you may end up using a shared staging environment rather than one per-developer, which reduces developer isolation. This is mitigated by the fact that your changes (and that of others) are local to your environment. Configuring a proxy or VPN that works with your cluster can be complex (although automated tools like Telepresence make this easier). When deciding on the most effective method for setting up a productive development environment for microservices at your organization, you can consider these four options in terms of four main tradeoffs:  How closely does the environment mirror production?  How fast is the feedback cycle for developers?  What are the setup and maintenance costs for developers?  How scalable is the environment as your application gets more complex?  The DevOps Zone is brought to you in partnership with Sonatype Nexus. Use the Nexus Suite to automate your software supply chain and ensure you're using the highest quality open source components at every step of the development lifecycle.

Lisa Felepchuk - May 1 Facebook Twitter Pinterest + Linkedin WhatsApp Email SHARE THIS Facebook Twitter Pinterest Linkedin WhatsApp Email Know any young, creative geniuses? You’ll want to listen up for their sake. One lucky Canadian student will be granted the chance to design a Google Doodle, the playful reimaginings of Google’s logo that celebrate certain holidays and events. The media behemoth and virtual epicentre of the Internet is on the hunt for students from Kindergarten to Grade 12 who can flex their creative muscle and dream up the next Google Doodle with a theme “What I see for Canada’s future is…” to celebrate Canada’s 150th birthday. “This year’s theme is open ended, which is good. It allows the students to unleash their creative juices and come up with something unique,” says Sophie Diao, a professional Google Doodler (talk about an awesome title to have on a business card), and one of the contest judges. On top of having their art displayed on Google.ca’s homepage for a day, the winning student also gets a $10,000 technology grant for their school, a $10,000 scholarship, a Google Chromebook and a paid trip to Toronto for the finale event in June. A stellar opportunity worth encourage your talented children to get excited about. So just how can you get them inspired? Diao suggests “looking at the things they love about Canada, the things they appreciate, and the things they wish they could change” to spark their imagination. As for what she’ll be watching for as she digs through submissions: “The biggest thing I’ll be looking for will be creativity, uniqueness and ideas that really take me by surprise,” the artist says. “And doodles that feel really positive and happy. The topic is something that is hopeful, so something that makes me feel like ‘Yeah, that would be awesome if that happened.'” If your young Vincent van Gogh comes up against a creative block or isn’t confident in their design, Diao has some sound advice. “Being afraid when you’re making art isn’t an honest way to create anything. The best way to make art is to have it come from a place of confidence and wanting to share something that is important.” A takeaway even us adults can appreciate. Students can submit their work to the Doodle 4 Google contest here until May 2. “Even if you don’t get selected, you’ll still have a beautiful piece to share with your friends and family. It’s not about winning, but it’s about creating something,” Diao says. Peek inside the life of a Google Doodler by watching this video below.

With no official tour planned, armed with only my phone and a data pack for company, I set out exploring the city, heading out to the most popular tourist spots, best places to eat and drink, all with the aid of reviews and pictures available online on TripAdvisor, Instagram and Facebook food groups. Google played the role of a local guide to perfection, guiding me to all the popular localities and exotic locations at the mere click of a button, with ratings and reviews instantly available. The Internet has changed the way the world travels. You choose travel destinations based on what your friends put up on Facebook, set out to eat the best food in highly rated hotels on TripAdvisor and Zomato, book places to stay on Airbnb, and rely on search engines more than guides in checking out a new place. In a recently published report by Colliers International, biometric-enabled baggage solutions, cloud passports, personalised travel, spontaneous travel apps, and virtual reality travel, are listed as the themes that will define the online travel industry. Self-service check-in facilities are undergoing a huge change with biometric technology playing an important role. In Auckland, Air New Zealand has installed the first of 13 biometric-enabled self-service bag drop units, which feature an embedded camera to capture an image of the passenger’s face at the point of bag drop. Baggage tracking devices are also being adopted by many airline firms. Australia is planning to experiment with a digital passport, that would incorporate identity and biometrics data and can be downloaded or accessed when required. Closer home in India, it is personalisation and community travel that are emerging as key elements of the online travel industry. The launch of Airbnb Trips in Delhi recently is targeted at helping users discover communities and their passions. Some of the experiences include song writing and producing music; learning more about the art of brewing coffee; a session learning about saris, among others. Google has also joined the bandwagon with a few tweaks to Google Trips, that helps people figure out what to do once they arrive at their destination, and now pulls in information from train and bus tickets that have been sent to your Gmail address. This ability of the online space to create and curate communities of people, with similar interests, was what resulted in Padhaaro, an online platform to offer customised experiences for travellers in Indian cities. “At present, we operate in about 18 Indian cities and are a platform that seeks to answer the basic questions that many tourists tend to ask – what do I do in a particular city? The main concept behind Padhaaro is to connect tourists or travellers with locals who can act as guides to a particular culture, and offer insights that would not be available to anyone unfamiliar with the place. The online space helps us connect locals with those on the lookout for options off the beaten track — from a cycle ride to the Nandi village near Bengaluru, to a peacock trail in Mylapore in Chennai, among many others,” says Ish Jindal, the founder of Padhaaro. “Most of our clientèle consists of travellers from outside India. Exploring outside the usual tourist circuit is also on the rise. Though Indian domestic travellers are not very keen on experiences at this point, the numbers are seeing a steady increase over the years.” Community travel is the basis of Byond Travel, a Bengaluru-based travel start-up that aims at getting people with similar interests to travel together. “Travel is also a lot about shared experiences. The rise of social media has meant that more choices have opened up for people to plan trips better, often with people they share interests with. You no longer need a Lonely Planet guide to visit the world. I feel that Airbnb and couch surfing are game-changers that allow travellers to get a glimpse of community travel and live like a resident,” points out Vikram Ahuja, the founder of the start-up. He adds, “We have created a virtual reality platform that will let you relive the best touring experiences, be it kayaking in the rapids or spending time on a remote lakeside in Ladakh. It helps you get the sense of the experience and helps you make an informed choice. Most of travel involves the anticipation of travel, and through virtual reality, we hope to bring this aspiration to life for travellers. I feel that in the long run, applications like Google Tango (an augmented reality platform that enables precise location mapping) will help build on the experiences of people who have visited a specific place before, and help make your own journey better.” The company is also introducing chat bots that will make answering questions about destinations and packages easily available to users. While Byond Travel has focussed on creating travel experiences, Thrillophilia.com aims at letting customers discover and book unique activities and connects local activity providers with travellers across the globe. It was launched by Chitra Gurnani and Abhishek Daga in 2011. “When we started, there were no online marketplaces or websites with extensive information on activities and things to do. Discovery of activities and booking them online was a hassle. We relied on information from friends or whatever came along while we travelled. This seemed to be a big gap and motivated us to build a marketplace online to address it.” Talking about the solutions on offer, Abhishek says, “In the online space, from the user’s point of view, the hard part is figuring out where to start the search, how to book the experience, which one to choose, and so on. We aim at solving this through a strong curation model consisting of big data analysis, web scraping, and on-ground physical checks to ensure that the customers get the best experience.” He adds, “Mobile travel technology is a hot space in India. There are multiple players solving various problems and organising disorganised spaces in travel such as RedBus, Uber, Airbnb and more. In the activity space, the problem is bigger and no one has emerged as a leading player in solving this problem for Asia.” The change by digitisation is changing the way travel agencies work too. Tino Thomas, managing director of Oasis Holidays, a travel agency, points out, “Aggregator sites have made booking tickets very easy. You get the best rates and are no longer dependent on travel agents alone. Booking tickets is easier. This holds true for hotel bookings as well. However, in smaller towns, where data is not very fast, travel agencies are the best bet.” He adds, “It has made handling logistics much easier. One of the biggest changes is that it has generated more awareness about lesser-known countries and locations. A few years ago, most travel would be restricted to well-known locations such as Thailand, Western Europe and the United States. Now, South America, countries such as Uzbekistan and countries from the former Soviet Union Bloc are getting a lot of visitors, mainly inspired by social media posts of tourists from these places. Travel is becoming more and more of a group activity.” Post a Comment More In Sci-Tech Related Articles << Previous Story Polio case numbers drop in Pak., Afghanistan Next Story >> Twitter partners with Bloomberg for streaming news 24/7 Please Wait while comments are loading...

The code commits on AOSP Gerrit present fans with a ray of hope that Google has already made a working model of its impending handset. "Finally got around to manually testing this on a walleye device," the engineer, named David Zeuthen, says in one of the comments. However, the engineer's comment does not directly refer to the Pixel 2 by name. According to older leaks, Google plans to launch three next gen- smartphones. These are codenamed Muskie, Taiwen, and Walleye for the Pixel 2 XL, Pixel XXL, and Pixel 2, respectively. Zeuthen's reference that he tested some aspect on the Walleye device suggests that the engineer got his hands on a working Pixel 2 prototype. However, a probability exists that an older-gen Pixel or Nexus device is running the software the Pixel 2 will possibly deploy. The same conditions may then be adapted for the final device once it is ready. The simplest way to explain the leaked comment is that Google is testing out the future versions of Android on the Google Pixel 2. Google Pixel 2: Rumored Specs Weeks of speculations and rumors have led to a string of theories about what the next-gen Google Pixel smartphone will feature. The Google smartphone may sport a 5.5-inch Quad HD (2,560 x 1,440 pixels) display. The Pixel 2 will likely be powered by Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 835 chipset, which is used by the Galaxy S8. Rumors are rife that the Pixel 2 could supported functionalities such as Daydream VR, Google Assistant, and Pixel Launcher. The next smartphone is expected to come pre-loaded with Google's Android O or Android Oreo operating system. It cannot be said with certainty whether the engineer's comment meant that the Google Pixel 2 was nearly ready. However, the company may possibly share more details regarding its upcoming smartphone during Google I/O, which is slated for May 17, 18, and 19.

Week Ahead Brings Heavy Load With Earnings, Data, Fed Meeting How The Biggest U.S. Companies Have Changed Over A Decade Amazon Q– Earnings Should Yield Positive Stock Price Movement (GuruFocus) Loup Ventures in a note released last Friday analyzed threadbare the prospects of the three most prevalent digital devices available for mobile devices, namely Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL)'s Siri, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)'s Google Assistant and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT)'s Cortana. Methodology The analysis was based on 800 queries posed to each assistant, with the queries graded on two metrics, namely whether the assistant understood the query correctly and whether the assistant answered the query correctly. The queries were broken down into local, commerce, navigation, information and command. The firm noted that the queries were the same as posed to Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN)'s Echo and Google's Google Home in February, with Google Home winning the battle of wits by a narrow margin. And The Winner Is... Google Assistant came on top, having understood 99.9 percent of the queries and answering 74.8 percent of them correctly. In comparison, Siri understood 94.4 percent of the questions correctly and answered 66.1 percent correctly. Meanwhile, Cortana understood 97.3 percent and answered 48.8 percent correctly. Category-Wise Results Munster noted Google lead in navigation and information, but in local, commerce and command-related queries, both Siri and Google Assistant were on equal footing. Cortana was the laggard in all categories, except for information, where it stood second. Navigation And Information: Google's Forte Munster said Google's commanding lead in the navigation and information categories reflects the company's focus on organizing the world's information. That said, the analyst thinks accuracy is key to consumer adoption. "Users expect that the information provided by an assistant is accurate. When navigation guidance fails a user, for example, particularly early on in the adoption cycle, the user will avoid using the assistant in the future," Munster explained. Siri: A Credible Runner Up Loup Ventures noted Apple's Siri performed well across the board, with its ability to interpret user commands accurately setting it apart from others. Thus, the firm views command as an important category for Apple, as it makes a push into homes with its HomeKit. According to the firm, Siri offers the best connection between a user's mobile life and home life, which Amazon will struggle to do without an integrated smartphone platform. Cortana Trails Yet Performs Better Relative To Expectations Munster noted that Cortana, though taking the last place, performed better than expected, especially in understanding the query, outperforming Siri in this regard. However, it was not well equipped to answer queries, the analyst noted. "Given its investments in Bing, the company should be especially able to improve information, navigation, and local performance over time," Munster said. "We expect Microsoft to continue to invest in its Cortana platform, as it will be an important part of its AR/VR hardware in the future." Digital Assitants Head And Shoulders Above Home Assistants Although conceding that it is an apples-to-oranges comparison, Loup Ventures said digital assistants have a strong lead in navigation, local and command queries. The firm sees the comparison as a way to gauge the areas where home assistants would likely to see improvements next. "In the future, we expect to ask Alexa for a traffic update in the morning, and have new directions sent to our phones before we leave," the firm said. The Future Loup Ventures believes digital assistants will become an integral part of our lives in time, with additional inputs such as images, likely expanding the digital assistant's skillset. The firm pointed to Echo Look Amazon introduced this week, which features a camera that takes pictures of your outfit to make fashion suggestions and catalog your wardrobe. "Just as we saw with the smartphone, new variations of hardware will enable broader skills for digital assistants. The screen-less future depends, in part, on natural language interfaces to more easily perform everyday computing tasks," the firm concluded. Related Links: Apple Vs. Amazon Vs.

Add that to the fact that earnings growth for the S&P 500 for 2017 is expected to come in at +10.2%, which would be the best growth rates for the venerable index since 2012. It all totals up to the kind of positive scenario that could keep this old and somewhat tired bull market moving forward. In a series of new research reports from the analysts at Jefferies, the firm’s top growth stocks to buy now are companies that posted very solid first-quarter results, and these are exactly the kind of stocks that investors looking to stay long the stock market need to focus on now. Alphabet The search giant continues to expand and is even working on a driverless car now. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is a global technology company focused around key areas, such as search, advertising, operating systems and platforms, enterprise and hardware products. It generates revenue primarily by delivering online advertising and by selling apps and contents on Google Play, as well as hardware products. The company provides its products and services in more than 100 languages and in 190 countries, regions and territories. Alphabet offers performance and brand advertising services. It operates through Google and Other Bets segments. The Google segment includes principal internet products, such as Search, Ads, Commerce, Maps, YouTube, Apps, Cloud, Android, Chrome and Google Play, as well as technical infrastructure and newer efforts, such as virtual reality. The analysts point to Google Cloud, which is the largest cloud infrastructure and engages in more technology, infrastructure research and development in headcount and dollars than any other company. That gives it the strength and wherewithal to compete with and differentiate itself from Amazon’s AWS and Microsoft’s Azure. The company posted massive earnings this week, hammering analysts’ expectations. Revenue beat on Sites, Networks and Google Other. Paid clicks and CPC also were ahead of consensus. Wall Street is very positive on core margin improvement. Despite approaching $100 billion revenue run-rate, the company shows no signs of slowing down. The Jefferies price target for the stock is a stunning $1200. The Wall Street consensus price objective is $983.60. The stock closed Friday at $924.52 a share, up almost 4% on the day. Fleetcor Technologies The Jefferies team expects this top business service company to report solid earnings this week. Fleetcor Technologies Inc. (NYSE: FLT) provides fuel cards, commercial payment and data solutions, stored value solutions and workforce payment products and services. The company sells a range of customized fleet and lodging payment programs, and it offers card products to purchase fuel, lodging, food, toll, transportation and related products and services at participating locations. The company also offers telematics solution that allows fleet operators to monitor the capacity utilization and movement of vehicles and drivers, vehicle maintenance services, prepaid fuel and food vouchers and cards, and workforce payment product related to public transportation and toll vouchers. In addition, it provides proprietary equipment that reduces unauthorized and fraudulent transactions to over-the-road trucking fleets, shipping fleets and other operators of heavily industrialized equipment, including sea-going vessels, mining equipment, agricultural equipment and locomotives. The analysts noted this in the report: More interesting is the fact that the company is likely to release incremental metrics on the May 3rd earnings-per-share call to help disprove bear claims that US small fleet fees represent a large percentage of the company’s revenue. We look for 18% EPS growth for the company in 2017. Jefferies has a $197 price target for the stock, and the posted consensus target is $187.03. The stock closed last Friday at $141.14 per share.

X Toggle navigation News Equipment Business Products Blogs Tech Top 250 Reviews Tech Toolbox SEARCH Subscribe Newsletters Advertise News Equipment Business Products Blogs Tech Top 250 Reviews Tech Toolbox Driver recruiting goes mobile, social and increasingly high-tech By Todd Dills “Word of mouth is the biggest thing for a driver” evaluating a company, says Steve Fields, a driver for Overland Park, Kan.-based YRC and an America’s Road Team captain. Low-tech messaging such as the driver-centric slogans on Crete Carrier’s trailers – “Our most valuable resource sits 63 feet ahead” – can be effective in spurring CB conversations on the road. But such conversations increasingly are taking place online. That’s where more direct recruiting ad dollars are going, as fleets look to broadcast their company culture through a variety of media and methodologies, from online job boards, social platforms and search engines to sophisticated online remarketing and retargeting. “I’ve been in advertising for 13 years now,” says Rob Hatchett, vice president for recruiting and communications for Chattanooga, Tenn.-based Covenant Transport. His past four in trucking have been eye-opening throughout the industry as the focus has changed. “The whole goal of anybody marketing or advertising – how to get your product in front of people’s eyeballs,” Hatchett says. “When I came to Covenant four years ago, we were spending 50 percent in digital and the other 50 percent in print media. We are now 92 percent digital and 8 percent print.” That’s a big and rapid shift that recognizes how and where drivers spend their time. “It’s easier and cheaper to get your product in front of more truck drivers,” Hatchett says. When he came to trucking, driver smartphone use wasn’t exactly an unwritten rule, but today, “it’s the norm,” he says. They “have apps, social media, they’re on Google, they’re watching YouTube videos.” Attracting experienced drivers to your fleet among stiff competition is a matter of recognizing trends, getting in front of waves of new technology and practices and allocating resources where they’ll be the most effective. Increasingly, those areas involve optimizing drivers’ online experiences on mobile devices and, perhaps most importantly, devising an effective strategy for social media as a first point of contact. In this edition of CCJ’s Tech Toolbox, we look at technologies and services that some of the nation’s largest fleets are using to find drivers that may inspire your path to do the same.

Among the company’s data-driven digital recruiting campaigns conducted for a variety of trucking clientele, “81 percent of the traffic generated [in Q4 2016] is now mobile,” Reid says. For company driver- and owner-operator-focused media brands, respectively, 75 percent and 65 percent of the traffic was mobile-based, with another “9 to 10 percent” in each case representing mobile tablet traffic. Technology can help generate positive word of mouth and build a fleet’s brand in many ways. Key in today’s world is being present and optimized for mobile users, Reid says. Referencing CCJ’s Top 250 list of the nation’s largest for-hire fleets, “one out of every three of the Top 250 fleets don’t have mobile-friendly websites,” he says. While many of those fleets do target recruits with custom landing pages that are mobile-friendly and designed to provide a trackable place for candidates to fill out applications and/or express interest otherwise, Reid calls a non-mobile-friendly corporate home page a big missed opportunity. A “major thing we use to measure branding success is brand search volume,” or how often the company name is searched in Google, he says. When a Google search on a company leads to “the corporate page that’s not a mobile-friendly landing page – the interaction with your brand creates a first impression that’s hard to change,” Reid says. “People are used to the immediacy of choice. If you don’t deliver, they’ll go somewhere else.” Beyond branding, decision-making around application form design always should be mobile-centric, says Priscilla Peters, vice president for marketing and training for Conversion Interactive Agency. “Focus on applications being user-friendly and quick and easy – mobile-optimized.” – FedEx Freight driver and America’s Road Team captain Don Logan, on trends toward drivers’ use of mobile devices that have accelerated quickly in recent years “If you have a long application online that’s not easily filled out from a mobile device,” it’s not going to perform as well or generate the volume and quality of leads it should, Peters says. Make it a short form or a form that auto-advances or gives users the option to autocomplete. “The mobile shift has been really big,” she says. Lane Williams, director of recruiting and retention for Alsip, Ill.-based Carrier One, speaking at Conversion’s annual Recruiting and Retention conference, spoke to the necessity of an active Facebook presence in his company’s branding and growth strategy through recruiting. The Carrier One Facebook page demonstrates an engaged sense of customer service for the all-owner-operator flatbed fleet. Williams said the company has provided a platform for its own leased drivers to answer questions that come up in comments under online posts. With their smartphones always at hand on downtime wherever they are out on the road, “a lot of them are on Facebook answering questions before I can even get on there,” he said. Driver recruiting goes mobile, social and increasingly high-tech Mobile-friendly branding — Learn how to be present and optimized Expanding social media — Work within today’s digital landscape Boyd Bros.: Recruiting goes social — Flatbed fleet uses Facebook to target needs Covenant Transport: Trying new things — Working the long game for long-haul teams Where available CDL holders live Maverick: Making movies — In-house video proves captivating Expanding social media — Work within today’s digital landscape By Todd Dills 244 Million 2016 Facebook/Instagram post impressions served by Randall-Reilly trucking media brands audience campaigns “Yesterday’s recruiting phone call is today’s social media comment,” says Priscilla Peters, vice president for marketing and training for Conversion Interactive Agency. “Their initial inquiry used to be to call the recruiting department. Now it’s to go to the company Facebook page and ask a question.” Devoting staff to monitoring Facebook comments to look for opportunities to engage can generate plenty of solid leads and leave good first impressions. Asked what tool had yielded the most recruiting success lately, Brad Vaughn, vice president of recruiting for Little Rock, Ark.-based Maverick Transportation, names the social network. “Social media has taken off way more than I thought it ever would,” says Vaughn, who recently found out firsthand what the tool has done for direct driver engagement. “Our folks that manage it were out of the office and asked me if I’d do it,” he says. “It was literally answer 10 questions, refresh and answer 10 more.” Vaughn describes generating leads this way as a matter of moving a conversation in comments under a post to a private message session, “then having a call” to continue the conversation. 44% increase in traffic to trucking media sites from social media in 2016 compared to the prior year Among smaller fleets, this kind of mobile technology-facilitated recruiting process is becoming the norm. Though Fleenor Bros. gets plenty of mileage out of 800-numbers on its dry van trailers, co-owner Kyle Cousins has had success via an expanded social media presence. The Joplin, Mo.-based fleet grew by around 33 percent between mid-2015 and mid-2016, hiring more than a dozen new drivers for its 40 mostly team-driven trucks. When Fleenor was half the size it is today, “we heavily relied on referrals,” Cousins says. “After a while, those kind of dried up.” After several high-profile custom-truck beauty show wins, Fleenor devoted time and effort to ramping up its social media efforts via a company Facebook page. “That generates a lot of traffic,” Cousins says, adding that numerous conversations have been initiated there. Drivers messaging the company via the page are encouraged to call direct for one of the few conversations that typically precede any prospect’s visit to headquarters. It’s a clear case of “strength capitalization,” says Lane Williams, director of recruiting and retention for Alsip, Ill.-based Carrier One. For his fleet with around 150 owner-operators, that means messaging that emphasizes the personal first-name-basis treatment of company contractors. 2nd Rank of social media as source of driver leads for Randall-Reilly client recruiting campaigns “We’re a small carrier,” Williams says. “That’s a good thing – if a driver calls into operations and talks to the director over there, it’s on a first-name basis – not truck number such and such. We allow an open door before they show up.” Close monitoring of and quick replies to questions on the carrier’s Facebook page is part of that strategy. From an advertising perspective, Facebook is now the second overall source of leads in Randall-Reilly recruiting campaigns, says Nick Reid, vice president of digital services. “When we talk to fleets” looking to implement social media strategies in recruiting, “some believe it’s too much work or too dangerous for their brands,” Reid says. “There’s a spectrum, but this is where you need to challenge your partners. There are so many tools and services out there that can help, with targeting and with data, to work with you for some of that heavy lifting on the social side. The benefits you get from a recruitment standpoint far outweigh” the disadvantage of not doing anything. Driver recruiting goes mobile, social and increasingly high-tech Mobile-friendly branding — Learn how to be present and optimized Expanding social media — Work within today’s digital landscape Boyd Bros.: Recruiting goes social — Flatbed fleet uses Facebook to target needs Covenant Transport: Trying new things — Working the long game for long-haul teams Where available CDL holders live Maverick: Making movies — In-house video proves captivating Boyd Bros.: Recruiting goes social — Flatbed fleet uses Facebook to target needs By Todd Dills Lori Furnell, vice president of communications for Clayton, Ala.-based Boyd Bros. Transportation, says the flatbed carrier in recent years has “really found our social-media presence [to be] totally integral to everything we do.” Either from the perspective of capturing driver leads or as “a total recruiting tool,” there’s no denying its importance, she says. Combined strategies can pay dividends CONVERSION INTERACTIVE AGENCY recently studied 10 clients’ recruiting campaigns and found that a combination of social and other online strategies performed significantly better than any one strategy alone. Clients’ ad cost per hire ranges between $400 and $1,000 or slightly more. Each client previously had been doing search engine marketing alone. Combining those efforts with a Facebook advertising campaign cut their cost per hire in half, the agency said. Through its Facebook page, Boyd communicates the company’s family image and more, with a goal toward branding and engaging drivers over questions that inevitably arrive. The company’s most-viewed video features Gail Cooper, chief executive officer and once a proud high-school cheerleader, leading a cheer for Boyd’s million-milers at an in-house banquet for the drivers. “We took an internal video and launched it out there,” Furnell says. “Then we had a lot of people asking about our company,” mostly questions about hiring area and home time. “All of that video mix can contribute to your corporate personality.” Boyd’s social media advertising strategy involves specific targeting of drivers according to company preferences and needs. “We know who we’re after, where they live, what they do and what their interests are,” Furnell says. “As much as we’re targeting them,” she’s found, drivers also certainly are “targeting their research” when thinking about where to apply. Furnell frequently asks new recruits about social platforms that they use, and the conversation inevitably turns to how they use the platforms to conduct their own research. One thing she’s heard repeatedly from drivers about such research: “The first thing I did was go to their Facebook page.” Online job boards remain part of the marketing effort, where Boyd can conduct more targeted marketing and do “better at finding an exact fit.” The company uses Tenstreet’s applicant tracking system to follow up on responses to leads and allow recruiters to know exactly what sorts of communications have been made with any individual recruit. “We can create a variety of emails and texts and all kinds of things to ensure” the conversation continues with any lead that hasn’t followed through to formal application, Furnell says.

I like to be the third person to the party.” With most recruiting campaigns now conducted digitally, proving efficacy is easier than ever. “Sometimes you have to try stuff,” Hatchett says. His department sets aside a certain amount of dollars a month to experiment with new tools and strategies “to see what’s going to work.” “I spend a bunch of money with ad partners sending me leads, then I take my applications over the past 12 months and constantly work the whole database. Rob Hatchett, vice president of recruiting and communications for Chattanooga, Tenn.-based Covenant Transport In analyzing your digital spend, he says to always “make sure you are portraying the right message” through whatever avenue you’re using to market to drivers. For Covenant, which employs team drivers for long-haul freight, “I want to make sure that if someone is calling, they already know they have to come in a team. In digital, you’re paying per click or paying per application – why do you want someone to click on you and have no desire to do what you do?” Hatchett’s department recruits for two affiliated fleets in addition to the Covenant teams – Southern Refrigerated Transport and Star Transportation (regional dedicated dry van). He’s seeing the most success working through the company’s in-house prospect database. “I spend a bunch of money with ad partners sending me leads, then I take my applications over the past 12 months and constantly work the whole database,” Hatchett says. That’s accomplished through a series of “basic email campaigns and through remarketing and retargeting,” he says.

The sites offer trucking employers access to driver leads to initiate conversations about potential employment. “We get around 11,000 applications a month,” says Chip Aldridge, Randall-Reilly Digital Services director. Many come from initial points of contact through job searches, Google-served ads, Facebook and ad aggregators such as Indeed.com. Trucking companies then purchase leads based on geographic need or by lane. Customers include many of the largest truckload fleets but also smaller carriers with targeted needs. “We have about 200 clients per month purchasing this type of service,” says Aldridge. “Half of the 200 clients are 150 trucks or less. I’d say 10 percent are in the 50-truck range.” Deep South states are perennially among those most densely populated by CDL holders treading the waters for employment. Mississippi ranked the highest in 2015, but Wyoming further afield was not far behind. Vermont and Massachusetts showed the lowest per-capita density of applicants.

It’s interesting to see how that’s changed. I can remember sitting in meetings where people would say, ‘If you pull out of the magazines, everybody’s going to notice.’ We didn’t do a magazine ad in 2016.” The screenshot in the player shows a recent high-quality video that features brief interviews with drivers in Maverick Transportation’s reefer division. Everything is happening digitally, from ad buys to applications. What Vaughn believes now is gaining Maverick the most attention from potential recruits are YouTube videos combined with the company’s Facebook social platform. A couple of dozen videos are available via the MaverickTransLLC YouTube channel and the company’s website. “They’re a huge tool for us,” he says. Maverick hired its own in-house videographer after realizing that working with an agency was “jaw-droppingly expensive,” Vaughn says. “After we priced three or four, we sat down and made a laundry list of all of the videos we could do. We lucked out and found somebody from an agency here locally who is super-talented.” Vaughn also lauds the video blogs of three or four of Maverick’s drivers who publish almost daily, noting that driver Dale Clay’s YouTube channel is followed by thousands of viewers. “We get a decent amount of hires from our drivers, but we haven’t hosted driver videos directly yet,” he says. For years, we’ve always said we’re a family company and that we treat people like they’re family members. Every company says that, but how else can you do that? You’ve got to prove that to them. Get them on the phone, and then do what you say you’re going to do. It boils down to the golden rule. Brad Vaughn, vice president of recruiting for Little Rock, Ark.-based Maverick Transportation The company also uses geotargeting in particular regions through a variety of means and data services. “When I first started and we had a dedicated job opening in this little town in this rural area of the country, we might try to run a newspaper ad or do local radio,” Vaughn says. “Often, I would end up sending somebody or go myself and set up in a hotel room or banquet hall to recruit. Now, with these tools to identify and market to specific people, it’s all changed the way I do business.” The ability of recruiting service providers to track data and verify the effectiveness of their strategies has greatly improved Maverick’s own in-house efforts, allowing for more effective use of marketing and advertising dollars, Vaughn says. “We’re able to see pretty early on” whether something is working or not, he says. “If it’s not producing, let’s reallocate these dollars somewhere else.” For applicant tracking, Maverick’s targets on leads “stay live with us for a long time,” Vaughn says. An applicant tracking system database from EBE Technologies enables the fleet to follow the touch points a driver has had with the company, including “text blasts, robocalls, mailers, advertising,” he says. There’s also still a lot of traditional recruiting that plays a role. “I don’t think that the bedrock things that attract people to the company have changed,” Vaughn says. “For years, we’ve always said we’re a family company and that we treat people like they’re family members. Every company says that, but how else can you do that? You’ve got to prove that to them. Get them on the phone, and then do what you say you’re going to do. It boils down to the golden rule.” The rise of video in recruitment marketing, internet consumption While Maverick Transportation’s videos have a slick professional quality, for those with lesser expertise or lacking the resources to hire talent to produce videos, there’s nothing stopping you from using moving pictures to your recruiting advantage. The march of technology has delivered on bursting barriers to entry, with high-definition cameras in all manner of mobile devices, GoPro cameras and webcams delivering views around the world directly from the truck driver’s point of view. What newer social platforms such as Snapchat have in common is one thing, says Oliver Feakins of AllTruckJobs.com: “Video.” Speaking at Conversion Interactive Agency’s Recruiting and Retention conference, Feakins said the proliferation of online video also is changing the expectations of those who consume the medium – including truck drivers thinking about working for your fleet. Worrying too much about high production values and image sanitization increasingly will backfire. “Ten years ago, it was all about production values,” he said. “Now it’s about authenticity. The next generation of would-be truck drivers is learning how to consume their social media in a video channel.” Feakins referenced the Youtube work of driver Allie Knight, who with a GoPro on the truck, among other explanatory videos and more, has garnered 68,000 followers and more than 20 million video views. “Her cost of admission into this was a $300 camera,” Feakins said. Analysis of online advertisements that contained video versus those that didn’t showed that cost per lead was considerably less for video ads ($6 per lead) versus static banners ($9). “Early adopters win, period,” Feakins said.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Reviews Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: What to expect from Microsoft’s May 2nd event 2 by Mehedi Hassan  @mehedih_ May 1, 2017 at 13:33 GMT18 hours ago Microsoft’s Education-focused event is happening tomorrow in New York City. Microsoft has a much bigger event next week as well, where the company will reveal the next big step for Windows 10 and a lot more. So what exactly is Microsoft going to announce at the event tomorrow? Well, there’s quite a lot of things — most of which focus on one thing: Microsoft’s education audience. Redmond is introducing a new version of Windows 10, and a new type of Windows devices to take on Google’s Chromebooks. Windows 10 Cloud / Windows 10 S Microsoft will unveil a new version of Windows 10 tomorrow. Microsoft is yet to officially talk about the new version of Windows 10, which might be called “Windows 10 Cloud” or “Windows 10 S”. The new version of Windows 10 is essentially the backbone of the hardware Microsoft will be introducing at the event tomorrow. That’s because Windows 10 Cloud is a lightweight version of Windows 10 that offers increased security, and only lets users download apps from the Windows Store. With Windows 10 S, Microsoft is clearly planning to take on Google’s Chromebooks. Devices powered by Windows 10 S will be quite affordable, and Microsoft will be targeting them towards its education audience. Windows 10 S is still Windows 10 as we know it, minus the fact that you can’t install apps outside of the Windows Store. You will still be able to download some of the Win32 apps that are available on the Windows Store, including the likes of Evernote, Slack, and even the full-fledged Office apps. This is also a security feature for Windows 10 — as users can only download apps from the Windows Store, their Windows 10 device can no longer be affected by malware. The best thing about Windows 10 S is the fact that users will be able to upgrade it to the regular version of Windows 10 at a price, which is really great because some users may still want to download the classic Win32 apps online and get access to all of the advanced features in Windows 10. We took a detailed look at Windows 10 Cloud recently, and you can find that here. CloudBook Along with Windows 10 Cloud, Microsoft will introduce new hardware that comes with it. The new hardware is going to be called CloudBook, and Microsoft will likely also introduce its own CloudBook — possibly under the Surface brand. It is highly likely Microsoft will show off some other CloudBook devices from its OEM partners such as Dell, HP, Acer, and Asus as well. As the CloudBook devices are supposed to be Chromebook competitors, they will be affordable — which means you won’t get the fastest CPUs or the best display. Instead, these devices will focus on the price while providing a seamless experience. According to a recent leak, the recommended minimum specs for a CloudBook includes a quad-core Intel Celeron processor, 4GB of RAM, 32 GB of storage, a better larger than 40WHr so that it’s capable of providing an all-day battery life for most students. If Microsoft does introduce its own CloudBook device, it will likely include a slightly more powerful set of specs, which means it will be a bit more expensive — and if it is indeed part of the company’s Surface line of devices, that will be completely fine because of the brand. There’s a lot we don’t know about CloudBook, and that, of course, includes the price which is really crucial for Microsoft. CloudBooks need to be cheaper than most Chromebooks, or at least come at the same price range — and if that’s not the case, I doubt Microsoft’s plans will succeed. Office on Windows Store Another big part of Windows 10 Cloud and CloudBook is Office. Microsoft’s Office suite is probably the most important applications for its education audience. But as Windows 10 Cloud is only able to downloads app from the Windows Store, that’s a major problem for Microsoft. Sure, the company already has the Office Mobile apps on the Windows Store but they aren’t quite full-featured. As we previously reported, Microsoft is also expected to bring the full-fledged Office desktop apps to the Windows Store tomorrow. The company is bringing the classic Office desktop apps to the Windows Store using its Desktop App Bridge which essentially allows developers to bring their classic Win32 apps to the Windows Store. By bringing the classic Office apps to the Windows Store, Microsoft is removing the biggest hurdle for Windows 10 Cloud and CloudBooks. Along with being able to download and install the classic Office apps from the Windows Store, Windows 10 users will also be able to buy Office 365 subscriptions directly from the Windows Store. And that’s pretty neat. CONCLUSION The May 2nd event is quite substantial for Microsoft. Chromebooks are posing quite a lot of threat to Microsoft, and even Apple. Microsoft knows it needs to compete with Google before it’s too late, and the May 2nd event could possibly be the start of something new for Microsoft. Even though there are quite a lot of cheap Windows 10 tablets that are trying to compete with Chromebooks, CloudBooks might be even cheaper as Windows 10 Cloud will likely be available at a lower price than Windows 10 Home or Pro to OEMs. That’ll cut the cost of production for OEMs, which means they will be able to sell their Windows 10 devices at a lower price. Will it work out for Microsoft? Who knows. The company’s Windows RT was quite similar to Windows 10 Cloud, but Windows 10 Cloud is still a lot different from Windows RT. When Microsoft launches Windows 10 devices powered by ARM processors, Windows 10 Cloud might turn out to be immensely useful, but that’s something we’ll get to see in the future. But for now, the May 2nd event should be very interesting and give us some more details on Microsoft’s plans for killing the Chromebook. Catch MSPU’s live coverage As per usual, we will be covering the May 2nd event live, which starts at 9:30AM Eastern Time (that’s 13:30 GMT). We are actually attending the event in New York City tomorrow, so we’ll also be publishing a lot of hands-on pictures, videos, and all the other good stuff.

The takedown notice, spotted by TorrentFreak, was sent to Google by NetResult on behalf of the Premier League. Such notices request that Google remove results from its Search service that offer unlicensed video streams of football matches for free. In the past, large scale efforts to block access to (or lower the visibility of) websites that engage in copyright infringement have been criticized for catching innocent targets in the web. This little snafu - in which NetResult identified https://www.facebook.com as a link that should be removed from Google's search results - is a rather dramatic example of an innocent party being identified and targeted. Fortunately for Facebook, Google decided not to comply with the takedown request and Facebook's homepage can still be found by the world's most popular search engine.

The local arm of the California-headquartered company has said it will "lodge an objection", according to Fairfax Media. "The company will continue to uphold its positions against any and all such claims," Google Australia reportedly said in its latest filings with the corporate regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC). The move comes after the government passed the Diverted Profits Tax Bill 2017 - commonly referred to as the Google Tax - and Treasury Laws Amendment (Combating Multinational Tax Avoidance) Bill 2017 earlier this year. The two pieces of legislation were designed to target multinational corporations avoiding tax responsibilities in Australia by moving profits overseas. Google Australia reported revenue of $1.14 billion in 2016 but paid just over $16 million in tax, according to its ASIC financial filings. From January 2016, the company restructured to record revenue from selling to Australian-based customers. This resulted in a revenue increase of $644 million. As a result, it declared a profit of $121 million in 2016, an increase from $50 million the previous year and showed the company paid an effective tax rate of 13.7 per cent. During a parliamentary hearing in April 2015, Google, Microsoft and Apple revealed that they were all being audited by the ATO, while giving evidence at a Senate inquiry into tax avoidance. At the time, Google Australia managing director, Maile Carnegie, defended the company’s accounting practices, saying the majority of tax paid by the company was in the US because the company is headquartered there and is the centre for research and development which incurs the most risk. Read more Google Cloud growth is outpacing the company's ad business "And that in turn is what drives our profits," Carnegie said. "It's very easy to underestimate the risks and also the costs that are required ... to develop that intellectual capital." The three global tech giants are among a list of multinational corporations accused of avoiding paying their fair share in local taxes by diverting profits overseas. A practice that has drawn criticism for these companies and their accountants accused of manipulating Australian Taxation law for the benefit of their clients. In September 2016, the ATO put the “big four” accounting firms on alert, issuing a message warning of schemes to avoid the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law (MAAL), also known as the Google Tax. ATO deputy commissioner, Mark Konza told the Australian Financial Review in September 2016 that he had been at a presentation by a major accounting firm, with a client present, of a scheme to redirect Australian sales through a partnership where only 1 per cent of profits went to the Australian partner and the rest went to a company in a low-tax jurisdiction.

"We were so disturbed by such a blatant attempt to undermine the will of parliament [in the MAAL] that we fast-tracked this alert."

Pieces of works shared can be viewed in 3D through the new website by simply swinging round their device. Other users will also be able to like and even remix the shared images. Google says that the shared images are attached with a remixable CC-BY license by default that also includes attribution for the artist behind the original work. Apart from the sharing feature, Tilt Brush has also been updated with other customizable features that can be executed during the painting process. This include the option to manually set several parameters like color, intensity, and position of a key. They will also be now able to fill lights manually. In addition to the aforesaid, Tilt Brush is also having new environment settings through which users can adjust their works’ sky and fog settings.

David Gilbert explores whether it's worth having the smart device in your home Business & Tech Google Home (PA) 14:00 1 May 2017 David Gilbert 18 hours ago Many view voice as the next computing platform. From Siri on our smartphones, to Cortana baked into Windows 10, and Google Assistant in our cars, today it is already possible to talk to your computer rather than type or tap. But there is a problem with this. We, especially the Irish, are not very comfortable talking to inanimate pieces of glass and metal, in particular when in public. Saying "Hey Siri, what does my day look like?" in the middle of a crowded cafe or pub is just not the way we do things. While the era of pervasive voice interaction with our devices may be some way off, there is one place this revolution might be able to take off; in the home, where no one but our dogs can hear us. Following the surprise success of Amazon's Echo speaker in 2015, Google announced its own version called Home last summer. Home is a voice activated speaker powered by its digital assistant, Google Assistant, which promises 'hands-free help' for us all. Like the Echo, the basic premise is that this is a smart speaker which will respond to your voice - answering your questions, playing music, controlling smart home devices, and a myriad of other things which you have probably never thought to get a speaker to do. The question is, is this really the future of computing? Availability First, a note about availability. Google Home is not officially available in Ireland, and Google told Newstalk FM that it doesn't have any details to share about a launch at the moment. However it is available in the UK, costing £129 (€152), and using one of the many postal services which allow you to ship any item from the UK to Ireland for a few euro, such as Parcel Wizards, Address Pal or Parcel Motel, you won't be adding too much to the cost. There will be no Ireland-specific services available, but all existing features of the Google Home will work as normal. Design and hardware The basic Google Home model comes in white, but the company does offer interchangeable bases in a range of other colours and materials to match your home's decor. The squat speaker is pretty nondescript and that is a good thing for a device which is meant to blend into its surroundings rather than dominate them.   A post shared by Maryn / MJ (@marynq) on Apr 28, 2017 at 12:08am PDT As well as controlling the unit with your voice, you can also control certain aspects of Home with the touch-sensitive panel on the sloped top, including turning up and down the volume, playing and pausing music, and activating the Assistant. There is also a discreet mute button on the speaker, which allows you to make sure you know it is not listening to what you say. Sound The actual speaker element of Home is not great, though it's also not terrible. Don't expect to throw out your sound system. I found that the sound quality was significantly lower than the Bluetooth speaker (BeoPlay A2) I had been using in my kitchen. For listening to radio and podcasts the sound was acceptable, but for those wanting to use this as their primary source of listening to music, you might want to rethink your strategy. Setup Setting up the Google Home is pretty straightforward and painless: Plug it in, and when you hear the lady tell you to do so, launch the Google Home app on your smartphone to finish the set-up, connecting to your Wi-Fi network and logging into the Google account you want to use on the device. Initially Google Home only supported a single user account, but in a recent upgrade it now supports up to six, meaning it will recognise different users and answer according when they ask questions like "What's on my calendar today?" Talking to Google Home  For the most part, Google Home sits there and does nothing. But when you need it, simply say "OK Google" and it will kick into life. Unfortunately you can't change the activation phrase, and it does get annoying having to preempt everything you say. I found that Home was excellent at recognising my voice (even from a room away) and understanding what I was saying. I used it mostly to play music and radio (Newstalk FM obviously) by simply saying:"OK, Google, play Newstalk." The device is smart enough to know that Newstalk was a radio station and that it would use the TuneIn app to play it. Google Home (PA) Even with audio playing, Google Home's two microphones were still able to pick up my voice, without me having to scream in order to be heard. It lowers the sound of the audio to allow you complete your request, returning to the normal level when your question has been answered. While you can pick and choose the services through which your music and audio are played, you can only do this if the service supports Google Cast - notably that means Apple Music is out. Podcasts are also a pain point, as they are only supported through Google Play Music, which isn't ideal. Google Home also acts as a hub for all your smart home devices, such as lightbulbs, doorbells, thermostats and pretty much everything else connected to the internet. It allows you control supported devices with your voice, so turning down the lights and turning up the temperature can all be done through Google Home. So far, the list of compatible devices is limited to Nest (which is owned by Google), Philips Hue and Samsung's Smart Things, but more are sure to follow. If support broadens then this aspect of Google Home could become its biggest selling point. Google also allows you control your television when it is connected to Google's Chromecast, an Android TV box, or has Android TV built-in. Simply say: "OK Google, I want to watch Season 1 of Better Call Saul on Netflix on the living room TV" and within a few seconds the show will begin to play. There are dozens of cute and clever things you can ask the Google Home, but these quickly become boring after you have shown the 10th visitor to your house the same tricks. Google knows you Unlike Amazon, for most people, Google has a much better understanding of who you are and what you like. This makes Assistant potentially much more powerful (and creepy) than Alexa. It allows Google Home to surface upcoming flights (scraped from Gmail) when you ask about your calendar. It allows it to know that lamp you ordered from Amazon will be delivered in two days time. For some this will be too much of an invasion of privacy, but if we want these systems to work in the way science fiction films have been telling us they will work for years, this is the price we probably have to pay. Another advantage Google has over Amazon is that Google search results and answers are infinitely better than Bing, which are used to power Alexa. Google Assistant also understands context. Ask it how far away a restaurant is, and, after getting the answer, you can ask: "When does it close?" and Google will automatically know the "it" you are talking about is the restaurant. It may seem basic, but it's something Alexa is not capable of doing right now. What Google Home doesn't do There are lots of things: You can't send a message or an email. You can't buys items online. You can't make a phone call. You can't take notes... The list is long, but remember this is just version 1.0, and so it is no surprise that there are many gaps in the Home's repertoire. Google has already updated Home's abilities significantly since launch (adding the ability to add more than one account for example). You can expect constant updates in the coming 12 months, especially once third-party app developers get on board and beginning supporting the device; just this week it added five million recipes you can use hands-free while cooking. Is Google Home the future? Even though it is in my own home, I still find talking to an inanimate object strange. It is going to take a long time for that to change, especially when there are other people in the room. That said, the ability to play music without having to take my phone out of my pocket, or turn the lights on without having to get off the couch, are compelling reasons to get used to using my voice. It is still to be seen if voice is the future of computing, but if it is, then Google has a winner on its hands with Home. 14:00 1 May 2017 David Gilbert 18 hours ago news cards WIN: Your M50 tolls for an entire year every day this week on Newstalk #Trump100 most popular latest sport #PornWeek: The A to Z - by way of XXX - of pornography Dublin Port arrests after over €50,000 of stolen property seized Mark Selby retains the World Snooker Championship EA Sports Cup: Galway United beat Sligo Rovers to make semi-final site terms privacy advertise with us contact competitions apps appliancesdelivered.ie © Copyright 2015 - Newstalk Ltd.

Advertisement Sometimes, those new features and those phones really are revolutionary, but more often than not, history has shown us that for every Samsung Galaxy or Apple iPhone, there are a dozen more products with amazing-sounding features that never took off. Here are some of the most significant phone flops of all time. The Nokia N-Gage (2003) Back in 2003, Nokia was still riding high as one of the most successful cell phone makers around. But the world was slowly starting to move to a more connected space. Devices such as Danger’s SideKick and the Palm Treo were starting to show off the possibility of internet-connected mobile phones (i.e. the smartphone). At the same time, portable gaming was becoming more powerful wit Nintendo’s GameBoy Advance, and thanks to the iPod, everyone wanted an MP3 player. So Nokia had an idea: What if there was a device that put all of those things together? And that’s how we got the Nokia N-Gage. First launched in October 2003, this was supposed to be a smartphone, a media player, and a portable gaming machine. Unfortunately for Nokia, it failed at all three. Advertisement We’ve already covered why it sucked as a console, so let’s start with the shape. The N-Gage was shaped like a fucking taco (hence its nickname as “the taco phone”), which might work fine for playing games, but made actually using it as a phone difficult. To talk on the first version of the phone sans headset, users literally had to put the awkwardly-shaped device sideways against their head. Memes were born out of how ridiculous it looked. And the media player features were limited, with no ability to fast-forward or rewind tracks, the inability to put a song on a loop, and no support for playlists. An iPod killer this was not. Try as we might, it was impossible to find a reviewer who liked this gadget. Virtually everyone agreed that this was just a bad idea. But Nokia, God bless them, kept trying with the N-Gage, first with updated hardware, and then with a gaming platform no one used. Finally, in 2009, Nokia finally euthanized the brand. Gizmodo’s then Editor-in-Chief Brian Lam was absolutely brutal in his eulogy for the device, writing, “hope we never have to see you again.” The BlackBerry Storm (2008) If I’m being honest, I could almost write an entire article about all of BlackBerry’s failures at “revolutionary” phones. From the Z10 with its gesture-driven OS that no one made apps for, to the bizarrely-designed Passport that was weird on every level, to the Android-based Priv that I wouldn’t give to my worst enemy, BlackBerry has had a lot of duds over the years. But its biggest disaster is still the BlackBerry Storm. Advertisement Sponsored In 2008, BlackBerry was still one of the world’s leaders, thanks to its trademark keyboarded smartphones like the Curve, the Pearl, and the Bold, which were adored by millions. But the iPhone—then exclusively on AT&T’s network in the US—was rising fast. It had apps and games BlackBerry could only dream of, and its fancy glass touchscreen was a hit. So BlackBerry, largely at Verizon’s behest, decided to create its own touchscreen “iPhone killer.” The Storm was born. It was launched in the US in the fall of 2008 as a Verizon exclusive (it was available on other carriers in other parts of the world). The brilliant minds in Waterloo, Canada weren’t content with just making a touch screen BlackBerry—they decided to help retain the keyboard millions of BlackBerry users loved by making the screen something you could press into to get a clicky feel. None of it really worked right. The old BBOS operating system was never truly optimized for touch, and the mechanical mechanism on the bottom of the screen that accomplished that “clicky” feature was a total dud. Oh, and the phone was designed so quickly, the software was insanely buggy from the get-go. But none of that deterred the BlackBerry faithful—at first. When respected gadget columnist David Pogue, then of The New York Times, gave the phone a blisteringly negative review, he got hate mail from BlackBerry fanbois. The backlash was so intense, it necessitated Pogue write a follow-up column, which included some of the more virulent remarks from BlackBerry defenders “I have serious doubts about your ability to evaluate tech. And your friends, for that matter. Yes, the Storm has a different emphasis than past BlackBerries, but it will continue to sell like pancakes.” History ended up proving Pogue right. The Storm was a flop (and returns were reportedly very high), and it helped set the company down a shame spiral from which it would never really recover. Amazon Fire phone (2014) Before the Fire Phone, Amazon had a lot of success in hardware. Its Kindle e-readers are in a class by themselves, the Fire line of small tablets have always been a good, cheap iPad alternative, and the Fire TV ecosystem is truly excellent. Given that track record, people were really excited about the advent of an Amazon phone. Advertisement In 2014, after months of hype and a reported five years of effort, Amazon finally unveiled its take on a mobile device, the Fire Phone. On paper, the phone came loaded with fancy specs, including five cameras, a 3D display, and a hardware/software feature called Firefly that could identify objects so that you could easily add them to your shopping cart. Although reviews were generally mixed, plenty of tech publications were willing to buy into the hype. Check out what my old colleagues at Mashable had to say about the phone after its release: Advertisement With that philosophy behind it, the Fire pushes Amazon further on the path of becoming the next Apple. ... For the Amazon faithful, Fire completes the platform with the most powerful and intimate of devices — the one that’s carried at all times. For the uninitiated, it’s the most powerful gateway drug the company could have built. Except it ended up not really being a gateway drug, because no one wanted the phone. For all the hype from tech blogs, consumers just didn’t care about the gimmicky features. Even worse, because of politics between Google and Amazon, the FireOS didn’t have access to the Google Play Store, which meant the phone couldn’t easily get Google Maps, Gmail, or Google Docs. Amazon and AT&T cut the on-contract price of the phone from $200 to $0.99 after just six weeks on the market. Amazon’s mobile phone strategy ended up being a gross miscalculation, which cost the company more than $170 million. In the fall of 2015, just over a year after the phone was released, Amazon finally extinguished the Fire Phone for good. Amazon has said it has no plans to re-enter the mobile phone space. That’s probably a good thing. HTC First aka the Facebook Phone (2013) Starting in 2010 and then for the better part of three years, there were rumors and speculation that Facebook was planning its own mobile phone. With every new rumor and speculation, journalists and pundits (including me) were paraded on CNN and CNBC and the like to talk about all the reasons why it made sense for Facebook to have its own mobile phone. Even before it bought Instagram and WhatsApp, Facebook was the most powerful—and most popular—app on iOS and Android. What better way to assume world domination than to make your own “iPhone killer”? Advertisement And so in the spring of 2013, Facebook finally did it. It released its own phone in partnership with HTC, the HTC First. Except, bizarrely, it wasn’t really a “Facebook phone” as much as it was a special Android launcher built by Facebook, which was dubbed Facebook Home. The idea was that you could get all of your Facebook messages directly on your home screen, quickly chat with friends using something called Chat Heads, and get near-instant notifications about what was going on around you. Sounds fun and useful right? Advertisement From Wired’s review: It’s nice to see that after so many failed attempts, Facebook has finally cracked the mobile software riddle. Here’s to hoping it doesn’t screw it up. Well, you know how this ends. It turns out, no one wanted a Facebook launcher on their smartphone. Especially when the smartphone itself was fairly boring. Barely a month after its release, AT&T dropped the price of the HTC First to $0.99 (down from $99). Within a year, Facebook Home was also dead (in truth, Facebook stopped caring about it the moment the HTC First flopped), and Facebook moved on from trying to dominate the home screen into all the ways it could copy Snapchat. Microsoft Kin (2010) Despite being one of the first players in the smartphone space with Windows Mobile, Microsoft has never managed to make the inroads on mobile that it did on the desktop. But of all of Microsoft’s mobile missteps, the worst might just be the short-lived Microsoft Kin. Advertisement Born out of Microsoft’s acquisition of Danger, the company behind the popular SideKick, the Kin was supposed to sit somewhere between a smartphone and a dumbphone. Unlike a true smartphone, the Kin didn’t have apps, but it did have access to social networks such as Twitter, Facebook, and MySpace, as well as Microsoft’s own internal network for storing photos and videos. With a marketing campaign placed squarely at hipsters, the Kin was supposed to be a modern social media phone. But it had one glaring problem: price. Advertisement Early on, a lot of people thought that if Microsoft could release the Kin at a low price without the need for an expensive smartphone data plan (remember the days before data plans?), it could capture the same market segmentation that had made the SideKick so popular in the early aughts. Microsoft and Verizon were alarmingly (in retrospect) coy about the cost of the data plans, but since it was a dumb phone, many of us had hopes that the price would be right. Verizon and Microsoft completely botched the pricing—requiring an expensive $60+ a month smartphone plan for a phone that wasn’t really a full smartphone. Still, I wrote positively about the phone’s potential in an analysis piece in April 2010: Advertisement [The Kin] is really targeted at teenagers — especially younger teenagers. And that’s why Kin might just be brilliant. Of course, I ended up being completely wrong; the teens weren’t interested. Advertisement Just six weeks after launch, Microsoft killed the Kin. According to Business Insider, before the company pulled the plug, the phone sold just 500 units. Brutal. In the wake of the Kin disaster, much was leaked about the infighting and poor strategy that led to the phone’s early demise. Years later, internal videos would show that even before its release, the Kin was just a disaster waiting to happen. Motorola Rokr (2005) In 2005, two of the most powerful consumer electronics brands were Apple and Motorola. Motorola was the leader in dumb phones, thanks to the success of the Motorola Razr. And Apple was well on its way to becoming the world’s most valuable company, thanks to the success of the iPod. So obviously, a fusion between the two companies could only be successful. The resulting phone was called the Motorla Rokr, and it was the first phone with iTunes built in. Motorola’s then chairman and CEO, Ed Zander wanted the world to really love the phone, check out this hype: Advertisement The Motorola ROKR represents the ultimate convergence of mobile communications and music. Fusing iTunes with your always-with-you mobile phone, we’re revolutionizing the way the world experiences mobile self-expression and entertainment. Too bad the phone failed to deliver on those promises. In fact, signs were ominous from the get go. At an iTunes launch event, where Steve Jobs introduced the device to the world, he had problems getting the Rokr to work correctly (you can watch the entire segment in the video above). You can practically see the steam coming out of his ears when the music won’t resume after a phone call. Advertisement In addition to buggy software, users were limited to storing just 100 songs on the device, regardless of how much space was free on the phone. And the process of getting songs onto the phone was a total pain in the ass. Motorola tried to make things better with future iterations of the Rokr line, but the damage was done. The phone was a bomb for Motorola and an embarrassment for Apple. Ultimately, the failure of the Rokr was a good thing. Had it been successful, Apple might not have pushed forward as aggressively with its other phone project, internally known as M68, which became the iPhone. AT&T Picturephone (1964) Before Skype and before FaceTime, AT&T was trying to make video calling a reality. In fact, for more than 30 years, AT&T really tried to make video telephony a thing. It ended up being a great tech demo, but also one of the most expensive tech flops of all time. The first AT&T Picturephone made its debut at the World’s Fair in Flushing Meadow Park in 1964. The demo—which my own mother saw as a teenager—left attendees excited about the future. Stanley Kubrick used ideas from the Picturephone in his epic, 2001: A Space Odyssey. Product brochures from the era promised “the bold beginning of tomorrow’s telephoning.” Unfortunately for AT&T, which spent half a billion on R&D for the PicturePhone between 1966 and 1973), “tomorrow” was really about 45 years away. Advertisement At its peak in the 1970s, AT&T never managed to amass more than 500 subscribers to its video telephony service. The costs were just too high, the products too big, and the value was too unclear. AT&T’s subsequent efforts at video telephony into the 1990s failed too. In 2005, Skype finally brought video calling to the masses—and for free. In 2010, Apple launched FaceTime, which finally, for real, made two-way video calling from your actual phone (or in this case, smartphone) a thing. ESPN Phone (2005) Back in the mid-aughts, there was a bizarre trend where non-phone companies decided to try their luck at being mobile carriers. Known as mobile virtual network operators (MVNO), the idea was that brands could lease spectrum from established wireless carriers to sell their own phones and services. Virgin Mobile, TracPhone, and Cricket Wireless all started out as MVNOs. For whatever reason, ESPN thought it would be a good idea to get into the branded phone and carrier space, and it launched Mobile ESPN in early 2006 with a big, glitzy Super Bowl ad (above). ESPN really believed that people would pay $400 for its clamshell dumbphone, a Sanyo MVP (a Sanyo!), along with plans that started at $35 a month for just 100 minutes of service, with no free nights or weekends. Advertisement Why would anyone do this? Well, ESPN was convinced that sportsmen love sporting so much that they would be willing to pay a premium for a shitty phone running on the Sprint network (Sprint!) that would get the sports alerts and updates. The phone also offered subscribers access to mobile video of SportsCenter, score updates, and highlights. As silly as this all sounds now, some tech reviewers actually bought the concept. From PCMag’s review, which gave the phone four stars: Advertisement The Mobile ESPN MVP is a very good voice phone loaded up with massive quantities of sports information. You’ll pay top dollar for top data, but have you seen the price of a Giants ticket recently? The general public didn’t agree with that whole “pay top dollar for top data” argument and the phone ended up being a fairly famous business disaster. Advertisement Just nine months after its splashy launch, ESPN killed Mobile ESPN. At the time, BusinessWeek reported in 2006 that ESPN had managed to gain just 30,000 subscribers, well below the 500,000 figure needed to make the investment break even. In hindsight, ESPN’s then president George Bodenheimer probably should have listened to Steve Jobs, who according to the book Those Guys Have All the Fun: Inside the World of ESPN, told him “your phone is the dumbest fucking idea I have ever heard of.” Stick to sporting, sportsmen. Samsung Galaxy Beam (2012) Samsung has made a lot of good phones over the years, exploding Note 7s notwithstanding. But Samsung has also made some supposedly innovative but really, really dumb phones. Take for example, the Samsung Galaxy Beam, which the company announced at Mobile World Congress in 2012. It was basically a Galaxy S Advance with a pico projector built-in. Advertisement Samsung actually tried to do the whole phone projector thing in Korea a few years before bringing a version to North America. For whatever reason, the company really thought that people would want to use their smartphone as a way to project content at low resolution on a big screen. The company even made ads showing off the most unrealistic proposal of all time (above). Samsung was positively breathless in its marketing copy for the phone, with its then mobile chief, JK Shin, saying: Advertisement Galaxy Beam provides mobile freedom, enabling a unique shared experience around digital content for everyone-anywhere and instantly-from a smartphone as slim and portable as any on the market. Sadly, that “unique shared experience” came by way of an overpriced, bulky, phone with specs straight out of 2010, running an old version of Android. Even after lackluster response to the original Beam, Samsung still wasn’t willing to give up the ghost. In 2014, the company released a successor—that still had shitty, outdated specs (again, the whole thing was very 2010), aimed at the Chinese market. Advertisement Come on Samsung, know when to let a product die. No one wants a projector on their smartphone and no one will ever propose using said projector. Google’s Project Ara (2013 - 2016) Technically, Project Ara wasn’t a phone—it never had a chance to be. Instead, it was a project Google invested years of time (and lots and lots of hype), only to ultimately cancel the device in 2016. Advertisement But let’s back up. Back in 2013, Motorola (then part of Google), announced that it was working on a modular phone platform, known as “Project Ara.” Project Ara was a basic phone with removable modules that could be switched out or upgraded, kind of like LEGO blocks. The idea was that instead of having to constantly upgrade an entire phone, specific components—the camera system, the storage, the CPU, and the battery—could all be expanded or upgraded with a new module. Additional modules could be available for extra stuff such as a a night vision camera or even a tardigrade aquarium. Advertisement The tech press (including Gizmodo), was all too happy to spread the hype about this concept. Check out what we wrote about the concept, which had already been delayed several times at this point, back in 2015: This is the powerful idea behind Project Ara—the exact smartphone you want, exactly when you need it. Going on a long trip and need battery life? Swipe out for a low-res screen and extra battery modules. Need to take great photos at your kids soccer game? Get that camera module packed with megapixels. It’s an ambitious dream to be sure, and one that won’t jibe with everyone, but it’s an idea worth exploring just to see where it goes. Too bad that “powerful idea” never turned into a real product. Not only did the project’s specifics change direction with alarming regularity (originally it was hyped by Google as a $50-$100 device; by 2016 the company admitted the first phones would cost the same as premium handsets), the people in charge of running the project changed too. According to Venture Beat’s excellent history of Project Ara, the development team never really recovered after Regina Dugan, who ran ATAP at Google (the division Project Ara was under), abruptly left for Facebook. And look, it’s possible that with the right leadership and support, Project Ara could have met the finish line, but that doesn’t change a very large, very fundamental problem with Project Ara (and modular smartphones in general): No one wants a modular smartphone. Project Ara is the most ambitious modular phone failure, but even modular phones from LG and Motorola have totally flopped and failed to take on with audiences. Advertisement Ultimately, Project Ara was a great demo, but it never had a chance at being a real product. And even if it had reached the finish line, something tells me that it would have wound up on this list anyway.   Recommended Stories Why These Great Game Consoles Failed Spectacularly Why These 'Revolutionary' '80s Gadgets Totally Failed Samsung Galaxy S8 Review: The Prettiest Phone Wins Christina Warren christina.warren@gizmodo.com @film_girl Christina is a senior writer at Gizmodo.

(Reuters/Peter Power) Share Written by Joon Ian Wong Obsession The Office May 01, 2017 Google is apparently testing a new job-search feature that includes its own job portal. The testing was caught in the wild by search engine optimization consultant Dan Shure on April 28. WOW look out job listing sites, Google appears to be positioning to eat up that real estate also (cc @dr_pete) pic.twitter.com/g56KxnJCA7 — Dan Shure (@dan_shure) April 28, 2017 Industry website Search Engine Land wrote about the sighting then got a response from Google that wasn’t an outright confirmation, but suggested the search giant was indeed testing the feature. Google’s statement read: “While we don’t have any news to announce at this time, we’re always looking for new ways to improve the Search experience for our users, whether they’re looking for movies to see, recipes to make, or job opportunities.” Dan Shure apparently triggered the feature by entering “jobs online” in the Google search box. This returns a specially formatted box containing a list of jobs above the main search results. Clicking these jobs leads to a portal where users can select tabs to display jobs by title, city, employer, and more. The page also shows jobs by industry, including health care, advertising and marketing, and retail. The jobs listed are attributed to third-party job sites, such as Internships.com and Catholic Jobs Online. .@dr_pete Here's a little video of the job listings in Google –> https://t.co/Hob62dA2uR — Dan Shure (@dan_shure) April 28, 2017 Google is also quietly working on a service called Google Hire, which bills itself as a tool to manage companies’ recruitment processes. Google hasn’t commented on the service, nor has it responded to a request for comment from Quartz on the job-search feature. The broad base of jobs available on the search feature suggests Google is going after the same general jobs market as Facebook is, with its own jobs function. LinkedIn is better known for its white-collar listings, but it, too, has been trying to cater to workers of all types, including blue-collar workers (paywall), in recent years.

What security benefits does it bring? Can it really make your online activities more secure? Read More against online threats. It’s just one of the many benefits of changing your DNS server 5 Nifty Ways to Use DNS to Your Advantage 5 Nifty Ways to Use DNS to Your Advantage One of the most underappreciated parts of the internet is the Domain Name System. DNS is often referred to as the phonebook of the internet, but it is far more than just a lookup service. Read More . If I’ve convinced you to switch providers, you might be wondering which company you should turn to. There are a lot of options out there 5 Best Dynamic DNS Providers You Can Lookup for Free Today 5 Best Dynamic DNS Providers You Can Lookup for Free Today DynDNS was always a top mention when free dynamic DNSes were brought up. But now that it's gone, are there any good alternatives? There sure are. Read More — but which is the best, what features are available, and are there any drawbacks? In this article, I’m going to introduce you to the five best third-party DNS providers for your security. 1. Google Public DNS IP Addresses: 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 I’m going to start my list with two of the most well-known third-party servers. First up, Google Public DNS. Google’s DNS most significant advantage is its speed. DNS lookups often cause a bottleneck that can slow down your browsing. According to Google’s research, the biggest cause of the bottlenecks are “cache misses.” They occur when a DNS resolver has to communicate with several external name servers to load a page. Google tries to mitigate the problem by offering three key performance features: Global coverage — There are servers nearby regardless of where you are in the world. Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack prevention — Google provides DNSSEC security as standard. Load balancing — Shared caching improves the cache hit rate. Although Google offers DNSSEC and DNS-over-HTTPS as standard, there is one significant security drawback to using the service: data collection 6 Surprising Ways Your Data Is Being Collected 6 Surprising Ways Your Data Is Being Collected You know that your data is being collected, mainly by your ISP and the surveillance apparatus of the NSA and GCHQ. But who else is mining cash out of your privacy? Read More . Remember, Google is an advertising company, and user data is its biggest asset. Although the DNS data it collects is theoretically impersonal, it might scare away some privacy-conscious users. 2. OpenDNS IP Addresses: 208.67.220.220 and 208.67.222.222 The other most commonly-cited third-party DNS provider is OpenDNS. Since November 2016, the service has been owned by Cisco. Users can choose from three tiers of service: OpenDNS Family Shield, OpenDNS Home, and OpenDNS VIP Home. The first two services — OpenDNS Family Shield and OpenDNS Home — are both free. The features are largely the same; they both have built-in identity theft protection and parental controls for every device in your home. The only significant difference is customizable filtering: the Family Shield is pre-configured, the Home package needs your input. The VIP Home package costs $19.95 per year. It introduces detailed internet usage stats for the previous 12 months (categorized across eight types of security threats 5 Online Security Threats That You Need to Tell Your Friends About 5 Online Security Threats That You Need to Tell Your Friends About You'd be surprised to discover where all malware is lingering today.

Read More and 60 types of web content) and the ability to restrict internet access to a whitelist of domains, thus giving users on your network a “locked down” experience. The company also offers business packages. Sadly, there is a trade-off for some of these services. The company stores both your DNS and IP address information, and places web beacons on pages you visit using the servers so it can learn about “what content is effective.” You can draw your own conclusions about that quote. 3. DNS Watch IP Addresses: 84.200.69.80 and 84.200.70.40 DNS Watch is a hugely security conscious DNS provider. It’s entirely free for all users and doesn’t offer tiered packages like OpenDNS. Its security offering can be broken down into four key areas: DNS Neutrality — The servers do not censor any DNS requests. This differs to some ISPs around the world who actively censor what you can and cannot access. Privacy Protection — The company does not log any DNS queries. It is not recording any of your actions. To once again draw a comparison with a typical ISP DNS server, many log your history, and some don’t even anonymize the data collected. Data for Sale — The company does not have any business deals in place with ad networks or other institutions that have an interest in learning about your online habits. No ISP DNS Hijacking — If you use your ISP’s DNS servers, no doubt you’ll have occasionally stumbled across a sponsored search page if the site you’re trying to visit does not return a response. They’re a nightmare for privacy; anything you enter on those pages is collected and collated by your ISP. DNS Watch doesn’t do this. You’ll just see your standard browser page if your request is unsuccessful. 4. OpenNIC IP Addresses: 206.125.173.29 and 45.32.230.225 The OpenNIC project is most well-known for its user owned and controlled top-level Network Information Center. It offers an alternative to typical top-level domain (TLD) registries such as ICANN How the Internet Works How the Internet Works We can now access the Internet from our home computers, office, laptops and our phones. But many people still aren't entirely sure what the Internet is and how it really works. Read More . However, the firm also provides free DNS servers. There are four servers to choose from. I’ve given you the two with the best uptime above (100 percent and 99.95 percent, respectively). Once again, there are some key pillars of its security features you need to be aware of. Like DNS Watch, it offers DNS neutrality and prevention of ISP DNS hijacking, but it also provides a couple of additional features. First, you get to choose how much data logging is done by OpenNIC. It gives you an unprecedented level of granular control. Secondl, and perhaps more impressive, you also get to vote in how OpenNIC operates. You can have your say in everything from deciding new TLDs to project-wide policy changes. If something happens you don’t like, you can make sure you let OpenNIC know about it! 5. UncensoredDNS IP Addresses: 91.239.100.100 and 89.233.43.71 UncensoredDNS is perhaps the least recognizable name on this list. The service operated by a Danish man called Thomas Steen Rasmussen. Here’s how he describes his background and the service in his own words: “I am a system administrator with a Danish internet provider, I was born in 1979. I run this service as a private individual, with my own money. The DNS service which consists of two uncensored DNS servers. The servers are available for use by anyone, free of charge.” The best part of UncensoredDNS is the two servers are entirely free of logging. The servers store no information about you as a user, nor do they keep information about how you use the service. Both servers are physically located in Denmark. Which DNS Servers Do You Use for Security and Privacy? In this article, I’ve introduced you to five of the best DNS servers for protecting your security and privacy. Which is the best? It’s hard to say. Mch depends on your personal priorities. If parental controls are your primary concern, turn to OpenDNS. If you want to improve your speed at the expense of some non-personal data logging, use Google. And if you want to be as discreet as possible but potentially sacrifice some speed and uptime, consider one of the latter three options. Which DNS servers do you use? I’d love to know. As always, you can leave all your thoughts, opinions, and input in the comments section below.

It also powers Allo, Google's instant messaging mobile app for Android and iOS, where it provides a "smart reply" function that replies to messages with automatic suggestions.  Back in January we reported that Google had opened up Actions on Google, its developer platform for Google Assistant, enabling developers to use its Conversation Actions for providing information, services, and assistance. At that time Google Home was the only device supported.     Now the Google Assistant SDK allows you to add Actions on Google, with its voice control, natural language understanding and Google’s smarts, to your own devices, as explained in this video by Wayne Piekarski.   The SDK comes with reference sample code in Python for prototyping on hardware such as the Raspberry Pi. If you want to work with other platforms, you can generate bindings from the gRPC API in a variety of languages. If you’re not familiar with gRPC, it’s a “high performance, open-source universal remote procedure call (RPC) framework”, also described as "declarative, strongly-typed, and language Independent" that uses Google Protocol Buffers as the Interface Description Language (IDL) for describing a service interface as well as the structure of the messages exchanged. This IDL can then be compiled to produce language-specific client and server stubs.  Being language-independent means that you can describe your ideal service API and the messages that it supports, and then use “protoc”, the protocol compiler, to generate client and server stubs for your API. Out of the box, you can produce client and server stubs in C/C++, C#, Node.js, PHP, Ruby, Python, Go and Java. You can also get additional protoc plugins which can create stubs for Objective-C and Swift. A developer preview of the SDK is now available for those interested in tinkering with platforms such as the Raspberry Pi 3. Later this year, commercial device makers will also be able to use the SDK across a wide range of hardware.  This raises the issue of cost, especially in light of the fact that Amazon has recently announced its charges for Lex, its equivalent bot-building cloud service, which has a free tier for the first year. Google hasn't mentioned charging for the Actions on Google service - but it could and making a distinction between tinkering with the platform and using it commercially perhaps suggests that a tariff will be introduced later this year.   More Information Google Assistant SDK Introducing the Google Assistant SDK http://www.grpc.io/ Related Articles Actions On Google Google Home Your Personal Assistant Amazon Lets Us All Use Lex To Build A Bot New Products For Amazon's Alexa     To be informed about new articles on I Programmer, sign up for our weekly newsletter, subscribe to the RSS feed and follow us on, Twitter, Facebook, Google+ or Linkedin.

Samsung needed to create a device that would make everyone forget about the Note 7's exploding batteries and it accomplished that. The S8 and S8+ are two of the best smartphones on the market. They aren't perfect, but Samsung came close. What might be most exciting about the latest Galaxy flagships is that Samsung has made smartphones fun again. Smartphone design has grown tired, with every device featuring some version of a flat, bezeled display. Samsung was the first to get to the table with a innovative bezel-free design, and you can expect smartphone design to follow. The Galaxy S8 is an Android device that finally values form just as much as function, something Apple figured out over a decade ago. The Galaxy S8 is a sleek, high-end device, and it's predicted that it will gain more traction in the enterprise than past Android devices. Galaxy S8 design The Galaxy S8 is beautifully designed with smooth, curved edges that complement the tapered OLED Infinity Display. It feels just as premium as it looks -- no plastic in sight with a body coated in Gorilla Glass 5. The design looks like it could be fragile, but I've dropped my own S8 more than once, with a slim case, and it's held up. I remember thinking the same about the iPhone 4 -- every new smartphone feels fragile until you're used it for a few months. The display took over the physical home button, and instead Samsung included a pressure sensitive button beneath the display. I like the haptic feedback. It's not like the Apple iPhone 7, where it feels like you're pushing the actual display in. But it's better than your standard vibrating feedback, you feel like you can give it a decent push even when the display is asleep. Of course, one of the biggest complaints about the home button is that Samsung didn't integrate a fingerprint scanner into the display. Instead, the fingerprint button is on the back of the device, next to the camera. This results in smudging the camera as you awkwardly reach around to find the scanner. I went in with low expectations of the fingerprint reader, and I've mostly relied on other authentication methods. But after more than a week of use, I've gotten used to it. I always keep a case on my devices, and the cut out for the camera makes it easier to blindly feel for the reader. Overall, I don't think it's a deal breaker, but it will ultimately be your personal preference. Sometimes a new phone also means building new muscle memory, and after two weeks with the S8, I have no problem reaching my pointer finger up to the fingerprint scanner. Just like past devices, the Galaxy S8 is IP68 water and dust resistant, with wireless charging and a 3.5mm headphone jack -- Samsung also included a USB Type-C charging port. The rear-facing dual-pixel camera is 12-megapixels -- same as the Galaxy Note 7 -- but the front-facing camera has been upgraded to a wide-angled lens with 8-megapixels. Although the rear-facing camera is the same as last year's, Samsung has boosted software performance for higher-quality images. The camera works fantastic in low lighting and, as with all Samsung cameras, images feature a slight boost in contrast. Whether you like the boost in contrast and saturation is personal preference, but I found images sharp, clear and vibrant.

It was a bold move for Samsung to include a dedicated button for its new voice assistant, Bixby. It's especially bold when you consider Bixby is brand new, no one has ever used it before and most Android users are loyal to Google's voice assistant. Initially, Samsung said the button would be remappable to another assistant or app -- which I was happy about. I use Siri and Google Assistant to do one thing -- set timers. A dedicated Bixby button felt excessive when I'm only going to use it to avoid forgetting laundry in my apartment's shared washers. Samsung decided to remove the ability to remap the Bixby button. Not only is that change disheartening, the physical location of the Bixby button is frustrating -- it's exactly where you'd expect to find your volume down button. The app is useless in its current state. I couldn't even ask it to set a timer if I wanted to. There's one silver lining to the Bixby button, depending on how much of an optimist you are. After my husband received his pre-order, he discovered at least one use for the Bixby button. If you delete every card and app from the Bixby screen, it becomes so glaringly bright white that you can use it as a flashlight. If Samsung wants users to be loyal to Bixby, it needs to make the app so good that no one will want to remap the button. Customers don't spend over $700 on a smartphone just to be pushed into using any feature. This one feels like a clumsy nod to Apple's strategy, with Samsung slowly trying to entrench people into its ecosystem -- the exact thing most Android users are trying to avoid. [ Related story: Samsung targets the enterprise with Galaxy S8 and S8+ ] Galaxy S8 display The 5.8-inch OLED display on the Galaxy S8 speaks for itself -- it's gorgeous, with a stunning resolution of 570 ppi. Not only is it unique, but the rounded edges of the Infinity Display create an immersive experience. Whether you're reading an article, watching a YouTube video or playing a mobile game, the edges of the device just melt away. The curved edges are also practical.Tthe S8 looks large, but it doesn't feel that way when you hold it. I've found the iPhone 7 Plus, Pixel XL and past Galaxy flagship devices too wide for my hand, but the Galaxy S8 is the perfect size, even with a case. The 18.5:9 aspect ratio is a little odd at first, but apps that aren't already optimized for the new ratio can be "cropped to fit," including YouTube videos. And with the growing trend of bezel-free displays, it's easy to imagine the S8's odd ratio will soon be common-place. Another advantage to the tall display -- especially for business users -- is how effective it is for multitasking. You can float apps on the display in bubbles, quickly opening them to use a fully-functional, but scaled down version of one app without leaving another. On smaller displays, multi-window features always felt gimmicky rather than practical. But the S8's tall display makes Android's multi-window function useful. I never had to switch out of another app to answer a text or browse my playlists like I did on my iPhone. Galaxy S8 performance If you purchase the device in the U.S., you'll get a Galaxy S8 with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor. Outside of the U.S., the device features Samsung's Exynos processor. It comes equipped with 4GB of RAM and I found the combination of Samsung's processor and RAM perfect for regular use. The device ships with 64GB of on-board storage, and it's expandable up to 256GB with a MicroSD card. It's tempting to compare performance of the Galaxy S8 to the iPhone 7 Plus -- and for good reason. They're two of the best devices you can currently buy. I think the iPhone will always come out on top when pushed to the limit -- for example, uploading or downloading large files. Apple has fine-tuned its lightweight mobile OS to run seamlessly on its own hardware using a proprietary processing chip. Alternatively, Android has a lot more manufacturers and devices to please. That is, it needs to work across multiple devices, run widgets, allow for multi-window mode, support launchers and ROMs and offer users high-level customization. When you consider all the things an Android device asks of its OS compared to an iPhone with iOS, the performance of the S8 is extra impressive. Coming from an iPhone 6, I expected a choppier performance on Android. But with the S8, it's been a seamless experience. I haven't experienced any lag or poor animations; performance has been smooth and snappy. Galaxy S8 battery life It's no surprise that Samsung played it safe with the S8's battery. The S8's 3,000mAh battery is smaller than the battery in the Galaxy S7 edge, but Samsung claims it has a longer lifespan, losing only 5 percent of its capacity over two years. I can't test this claim without a time machine, but if it holds true, that's exciting news. In daily, average use, the battery is enough -- it's not great, but it's enough. Of course, it's going to depend on your settings, apps and general habits, and I find that in my first month with a new device I use it more often than I normally would. Over the past two weeks, I've pushed the S8 to the limits. I've loaded the device up with well-known battery drainers like Snapchat and Facebook Messenger. I kept Bluetooth on all day and used the S8 as my main streaming device for YouTube and Spotify. With heavy use, the battery got me through an entire workday, with a recharge in the evening. On days with lighter, more typical use -- days when I went out and reached for my smartphone less -- the battery got me through the day, well into the evening. The device charges insanely fast with Samsung's fast charge technology. It will display the amount of time you have until a full charge, which is useful if you're trying to get out the door. The fast charging made up for the average battery performance since I could quickly top the battery off. I expect that once the honeymoon phase wears off I'll have no problem stretching the battery life further. But if battery life is truly important to you, you might want to look at the S8+, which has a 3,500mAh battery. Bloatware While Bixby's execution was a misstep, one area where Samsung finally got it right is with its proprietary preloaded software. My Verizon pre-order arrived with a handful of annoying Verizon apps and games pre-loaded onto the device, but I uninstalled most of them. My T-Mobile review unit had far less bloatware than the Verizon device, and again, most of it was from T-Mobile, not Samsung, and I could uninstall the apps. Samsung no longer tries to force you into using its native apps. They come tucked away in a tidy folder on the app tray and most of them can be uninstalled -- not just hidden. With other apps, like reminders and the weather app, Samsung doesn't even include a home screen or app tray icon unless you enable the feature in the app's settings. Galaxy S8 enterprise potential If any Android device has the potential to edge out the iPhone in the enterprise, it's the Galaxy S8. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus have more to offer businesses, but the Galaxy S8 presents a legitimate alternative for IT. Enterprise adoption will also be pushed by BYOD -- the growing trend of employees using a personal device for work. The Galaxy S8 is primed for BYOD; Samsung Knox not only helps with EMM, it makes it easy for users to keep personal and business data separate. And with the Samsung Dex -- a docking station that lets you use the S8 or S8+ as a full desktop -- businesses will be more motivated than ever to embrace the S8. Samsung has built a smartphone that sets a new standard for other manufacturers, it's a hit with consumers and its appeal could sway the enterprise. With more display real-estate, a high-end design and impressive performance, employees can truly be productive on this device. And with the potential of docking stations like DeX -- full review coming later -- Samsung might be on the cutting edge of consumer technology and business mobility.

Sarah K. White (CIO (US)) 01 May, 2017 22:08 - - - - print email Comments IDG The Samsung Galaxy S8 has redefined smartphones -- it's all curves, no bezels and truly one of a kind. Samsung needed to create a device that would make everyone forget about the Note 7's exploding batteries and it accomplished that. The S8 and S8+ are two of the best smartphones on the market. They aren't perfect, but Samsung came close. What might be most exciting about the latest Galaxy flagships is that Samsung has made smartphones fun again. Smartphone design has grown tired, with every device featuring some version of a flat, bezeled display. Samsung was the first to get to the table with a innovative bezel-free design, and you can expect smartphone design to follow. The Galaxy S8 is an Android device that finally values form just as much as function, something Apple figured out over a decade ago. The Galaxy S8 is a sleek, high-end device, and it's predicted that it will gain more traction in the enterprise than past Android devices.

Home > Google News > Google's Vendor Slashes Quality Raters Hours; Will It Impact Search Quality? Google's Vendor Slashes Quality Raters Hours; Will It Impact Search Quality? May 1, 2017 • 8:05 am | (16) by Barry Schwartz | Filed Under Google Search Engine Prev Story Next story Tweet Pin It   Prev Story Next Story The SEO industry is in a buzz around a story named The secret lives of Google raters from arstechnica.com but not because of their "secret lives" - because most of us know how they work - we've covered them like crazy here. The big news is that their hours are now being slashed, cut in half. Many worked 40 hour work weeks and got paid well for their time. But "earlier this month, thousands of them received an e-mail that said their hours would be cut in half, partly due to changes in Google's staffing policies," the story said. Pay can be up to $17.40 an hour for "preferred agents" with excellent scores, while regular raters get $13.50 - all above the minimum wage. On Monday, April 3,2017 thousands of US Leapforce raters (Google doesn't employ them directly, they are outsourced) received an e-mail from "The Leapforce Team.". The letter said: Effective June 1, 2017, [Raters in the US] can work up to 26 hours in a calendar week (Sunday to Saturday). We understand and appreciate that this will have a significant impact on a percentage of our Rater community. That is why we are trying to provide you with as much time as possible about the upcoming change [sic]. Ars said that "roughly 20 percent of US raters who work full-time had just received a massive pay cut." Paul Haahr, Google's senior rank lead, recently explained how these quality raters had a new job, to target fake news. He has been a huge fan of the quality raters and said they provide extreme value to the engineers in making the quality of the results better. While quality raters cannot influence the search results directly - they do send invaluable information to the Google team to make the results better. Will Leapforce hire more people to make up for the time? Will the results suffer in the short term? All these questions are hard to answer at this point. Forum discussion at WebmasterWorld.

The feature was promised to be rolled out soon and I was able to see it this Friday afternoon. When you search for recipes on mobile in search, you will see the recipe cards. The ones that support the Google Home feature will say "Send To Google Home." When you click it, it gives you a notice it has been sent and you can go forward with the recipe. The "Send To Google Home" button then changes to "Sent to Google Home." Here are pictures: Here is after you click send: Here is what it looks like for recipe cards in mobile not to have the send to Google feature - the look naked: Here is a video of how it works on Google Home: Forum discussion at Google+.

He posted a screen shot on Twitter showing the tab. I personally cannot replicate it but I find it a useful user interface. Here is a screen shot: So instead of clicking on a reviews link and it taking you somewhere else, it will just tab between the reviews and the local business data. This seems way useful.

Search Reviews iPhone Android How To Reviews iPhone How To Auto About Best Best Weight Loss Apps Best iPhone 7 Cases Best Budget Apps Things Apple Watch Can Do Best Alexa Skills Android Galaxy S7 Best Samsung Galaxy S7 Cases Best Samsung Galaxy S7 Deals Best Galaxy S7 Battery Cases Best Galaxy S7 Screen Protectors Best Galaxy S7 Edge Screen Protectors Best Galaxy S7 Edge Cases Deals Best Android Smartphones Under $200 [2017] Best Cheap Android Smartphones [2017] How to Add Always On Display to Any Android Cory Gunther04/21/2016 This guide will explain how Android smartphone owners can get the same “Always-On Display” feature found on the popular Galaxy S7 or LG G5 for almost any new device. It originally debuted back on the Moto X, and is now a key feature on many flagship smartphones released in 2016. Motorola and Google both offer always-on display for their phones, like Ambient Display, but they aren’t on 24/7 displaying information for readers. That is something that until now, was only available for Galaxy S7, S7 Edge or LG G5 owners. However, a simple app on the Google Play Store delivers this for anyone and everyone. Read: How to Enable LG G5 Always On Display Those with an old LG G4, Galaxy S6, Galaxy Note 5, or any newer Android phone for that matter are probably wondering if their phones will get this. Samsung could add it to the Galaxy S6 or Note 5, but it didn’t come with the Android 6.0 Marshmallow update release. As a result, we’ve found a quick way for most new phones to have it as well. Read on for more details. Typically most smartphone users turn on their screen over 140 times a day, according to research. That’s a lot, which can often drain battery life very quick. As a result Samsung, LG and Motorola have added a new feature to their devices. If you want it on your device, we’ll show owners how. Unlike Motorola or Google, Samsung and LG have a small area of the screen turned on 24/7 with helpful information. Like the time, date, battery levels and incoming notifications. It’s called an Always-On Display, and Samsung even allows a small level of customization. This makes it so owners can glance at the screen and get helpful information without turning it on, saving battery life. Being able to quickly check the time, see that there is an unread message, or easily check the date on the fly. Always-On Display is a great feature that many love. At first I disabled it on the Galaxy S7 Edge, but have come to love it. Get Always-On Display for Any Android So how can you add the neat Always On Display features from the Galaxy S7 or LG G5 to your older Galaxy S6, Note 5, LG G4 and more? Easy. With a well-designed and highly customizable app on the Google Play Store called Glance Plus. Originally this app was designed to bring a Windows Phone feature to Android, but has since been updated with more options, more features, and different looks that simulate the popular new LG G5 and Galaxy S7. It works the same way, by turning a small area of the screen on. Either for a short period, or 24/7. What’s even better, is the developer promises the app only drains roughly 1% of battery life an hour, or 8% during an entire work day. The same claim as LG for its new G5 smartphone. As long as you have an Android smartphone (or tablet) with Android 4.3 Jelly Bean or newer, as well as a proximity sensor which almost every Android phone has, this app will work for you. Here are the instructions. Download Glance Plus from the Google Play Store Open the App and Turn the feature on Customize all the options, controls, brightness and more Turn off screen and wait for the Always-On Display The proximity sensor on users phones notices when it is removed from a pocket, and the always-on display turns on. Owners can also wave their hand over the device while it’s sitting on a table, for the same effect using the sensor. Shown above are three of the many different options available. Glance Plus has background images and clock styles to match the LG G5, always-on display calendars that are similar to the Galaxy S7, and tons of customization. From clock styles, font color, brightness, notifications which can be shown on the screen while it’s turned off, weather information and more. It’s like the Galaxy S7 or LG G5 on steroids, with a lot more options and customization. It’s also worth noting that owners may want to go in and adjust a lot of settings. Enable notifications, set a night mode where the screen won’t turn on at night, turn up (or down) the always-on display brightness levels, and other things. Overall Glance Plus seems like a great alternative to the Always-On Display feature found on other devices. It’s more customizable and capable than the Galaxy S7, matches battery drain of the LG G5, and has tons to offer potential users. Try it today for free, or get an even better paid version for $5 with in-app purchases.

The extensive Google survey in association with the dailyrecord.co.uk also showed the prospect of a second independence referendum will be the biggest influence on 47 per cent of the electorate when it comes to casting their vote on June 8 while Brexit will determine the decision of 37 per cent. There were a lot of mixed messages in the polling data with politics in Scotland in a state of flux in the wake of the Brexit vote and the SNP's push for IndyRef2. Nicola Sturgeon's party will struggle to hold on to 56 seats but her bid for independence will be boosted long term by a right-wing Tory government (Photo: Getty) At the last general election in 2015 the SNP picked up an incredible 50 per cent of the vote but that now looks like a high-water mark for Nicola Sturgeon's party. The expected Brexit bounce for the SNP has failed to materialise and voters don't appear to have the appetite for another referendum in the short term. Which issue will have the biggest influence on how you vote in the General Election? Fifty three per cent of those asked say they won't be switching their vote from 2015. That general election resulted in a seismic shift in Scottish politics as the SNP took 56 out of 59 seats to leave Labour, the Tories and the Lib Dems with just one seat each.

Theresa May headed to Scotland on Saturday as the Conservatives ramped up their campaign north of the border with the Prime Minister vowing to take on the "extremists and the separatists". Party strategists have firmly positioned the Tories as the last bastion of Britishness in Scotland and aim to act as a magnet for the Unionist vote. Hail to the chief as Theresa May greets an enthusiastic crowd in Banchory on Saturday (Photo: Getty) The party is confident they can win over disaffected Labour voters, who fear a second referendum. The Tories are looking to snatch around a dozen seats from the SNP and then present this as proof that there is no clear mandate for IndyRef2. The polling evidence suggest the plan is working and the likely voting intentions from our survey will make pleasing reading for Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson. Her party is on course to claim 25 per cent of the vote, which is whopping 10 per cent more than they gained in 2015. The Tories look on course to establish a real foothold in Scotland again for the first time since their MPs were wiped off the electoral map in 1997. Ruth Davidson and Theresa May are confident of a Tory revival in Scotland (Photo: Michal WachucikMICHAL WACHUCIK/AFP/Getty Images) Who do you intend to vote for at the forthcoming General Election? While the Tories are on the up, the SNP are down from their 2015 high with 39 per cent now certain to vote for Sturgeon's party. Labour, meanwhile, are in a sorry state on 18 per cent. They have slumped again in the polls under Kezia Dugdale from what was a previous low of 24 per cent in 2015. While this looks like good news for the Conservatives, their delight should be tempered by the fact 52 per cent of those asked say they would never vote for the toxic Tories in Scotland. Which of these best describes your feelings about the Tory Party? The survey also highlights the generation gap with 48 per cent of over 65s planning to vote Conservative. Who do you intend to vote for at the forthcoming General Election? (Over 65s only) At the other end of the scale 45 per sent of 18-24 year olds will be backing the SNP. Who do you intend to vote for at the forthcoming General Election? (18-24 year olds only) But what should be most worrying for the Conservative strategists is that their expected electoral success in England will only serve to further polarise politics in Scotland in the longer term. It now looks likely May will have a large majority and will form the most right-wing regime the UK has had since Margaret Thatcher was in her Prime Ministerial pomp. A hard-Brexit under a hard-right Tory government will inevitably further fuel the desire for independence among a huge swathe of voters in Scotland and the survey results shows this. Theresa May and her right-wing Brexiteers will add to Margaret Thatcher's toxic Tory legacy in Scotland (Photo: AFP) When presented with a stark choice, a clear majority would opt for independence rather than be forced to endure living under a rampant right-wing Conservative regime. The Tories may well stave off IndyRef2 in the short term and congratulate themselves on a job well done but their success could come at a costly long-term price to the Union they say they want to preserve. Just as Thatcher sowed the seeds of discontent that eventually led to the return of a parliament in Edinburgh, May and her gang of right-wing Brexiteers look destined to tip Scotland decisively towards going the whole hog at Holyrood.

The move comes after Google was recently criticised for placement of ads on its video hosting platform YouTube. In March this year, several major brands boycotted YouTube and have their ads out from the platform as they protested the placement of ads which were appearing next to offensive content, including videos posted by terrorism-affiliated groups. According to the experts, the boycott could cost YouTube's parent company Google nearly $750 million in revenue. YouTube Ad Boycott Could Spell Trouble for Alphabet's Google Google, at that time, promised that it was taking steps to deal with the problem and the move to introduce ad-blockers in Chrome seems one of the steps the company has taken to resolve the issue. Details of the plan have not been disclosed but Google has said it held "initial conversations" on the idea with publishers. According to NetMarketShare - a company that provides market share statistics for Internet technologies - Chrome is a dominant player in the Internet browsing market with a near 60 percent share. "The blocker would be likely to target certain types of ads that have been found to frustrate readers, such as pop-ups and auto-playing videos," the Financial Times report said on Sunday. Initially, it was expected that the company's ad-blocking plan was a blow to the publishers who are struggling to compete with Google and Facebook for online ad revenues. But the report said publishers are encouraged by the company's move as a way to clean up online advertising.

Mobile added “meaningfully to profit dollars” despite the company’s increased focus on traffic acquisition, which adds to costs. YouTube video ads are also leading to an increase in revenue from the site, as the company is spending on acquiring content for its YouTube Red subscription service. Alphabet said there was significant growth in its hardware efforts, like the Pixel phone and Google Home device, and also in Google Cloud. Advertising revenue sees boost with growth in programmatic Google’s ad networks raked in $4 billion, which the company said reflected growth in programmatic advertising, in which media buying is significantly automated. There was a slower rate of decline in traditional ad network, but there is little doubt of a shift of advertisers to programmatic. Both Mobile search and programmatic carry a higher traffic acquisition cost (TAC), the company said, and growth in both these segments led to a growth in TAC by 22% year on year. This was partly offset by a shift from the network to Google owned sites, which has lower TAC. Mobile is causing a shift in behavior, though: shopping queries on mobile increased by 45%, and the retailers are providing Google with their local inventory has doubled year on year. Advertisement “We have increased our investment in machine learning in our advertising business, with efforts like Smart Bidding, where our systems predict the performance of an ad and adjust advertisers’ bids in real time to maximize their results,” the company said in the call with investors. Google added that they had driven over 5 billion app installs partly because of their app-install ad program, Universal App Campaigns, which allow developers to promote their apps across search, Google Play, YouTube and the Google Display Network. Carrier Billing Google said that Google Play benefited from direct carrier billing, but did not share specific details about numbers. Remember that Google had introduced Direct Carrier Billing with Idea and Airtel last year, but that rollout was initially impacted when the DoT limited it to post-paid accounts only (a tiny part of India’s total mobile user base). That policy has since changed, but changes in the taxation there will likely hurt Google’s margins, or lead to an added cost for consumers. More on that here. Boycott YouTube mitigated These gains came in spite of a campaign to Boycott YouTube, which came as a response to the site showing advertisements alongside controversial videos — of racists and conspiracy theorists — leading many advertisers to pull out. Google says they made “thousands” of phone calls to reassure advertisers of the systems they had now put in place to give advertisers more say in where their ads are shown. On a more positive note, YouTube VR was Daydream’s number one app by time-spent, and around 50% of time in Daydream was spent on video consumption. The company said that YouTube revenue grew “at a significant rate”, driven primarily by video advertising. Note that YouTube also has display advertising on its website. YouTube Kids was reported to have gotten over 30 billion video views till date. Hardware While Google’s Pixel phone and Google Home products, along with other forays into hardware design and manufacturing saw “strong growth”, Google did not mention any specific numbers for growth in that part of its business. “Sales continues to be strong, and we are actively working to bring these great devices to more people around the world,” Google CEO Sundar Pichai said. He also pointed out that the Android ecosystem was seeing an upsurge in emerging markets, with 300 billion smartphones with the OS being sold in Brazil and India last year. Google has had a relatively late entry in making its own hardware, unlike its competitor Apple which prided itself on making both simultaneously. With the Pixel line of phones, tablets and Chromebooks, the company made its first step into manufacturing consumer electronics. Before this, Google’s only foray into consumer manufacturing was its Nexus phones, which it made in partnership with established manufacturers. Its Google Home smart speaker is a competitor to Amazon’s Alexa. Neither of these devices is available globally yet. The company also hopes to double the number of Android Wear smartwatches released this year. “Thanks to partnerships with major brands like TAG and Fossil, there’ll be more than 20 different Android Wear watches available this year,” Pichai said, adding that LG was releasing two flagship watches with Android Gear 2.0. Machine learning and AI “[…] we’re transitioning to an AI-first company,” Pichai said in the call. Google’s voice-enabled Assistant is being rolled out to more devices with the latest Android OSes, and also on Android Wear’s second iteration. It will soon be on Android TV as well. Google’s AI program DeepMind has been defeating top players in the complicated board game Go, and will compete against the world’s best players in China in May. AI has been a cornerstone of Google’s efforts lately, and it has played a significant role in branches of Google like Waymo, the company’s self-driving car arm. It has also been using AI in its translation service too.  The company’s neural network translation was rolled out earlier this month, with improvements in translation quality for Indian languages. Neural translation uses AI and machine learning to throw up better translations based on user feedback and aggregated data. AI is also driving improvements in long-established products like Google Maps, with features like Parking Prediction introduced from data drawn from aggregated records of user movement data. TensorFlow, Google’s open source library for machine learning projects, has been used in over 6,000 Github projects. Google’s Search has also benefitted from aggregated learning. “Every single day we see so many new types of queries. When you bring the assistant into the mix, you start getting even more different tips of queries, and queries are more casual, more conversational,” Pichai said. He added that text-to-speech, where on-screen text is read out by a voice assistant, will be improved “tremendously” in the future. Google Cloud and Enterprise Cloud remains one of Google’s highest ‘strategic priorities’, and the company has “[continued] to drive sizable growth, with Google Cloud Platform remaining one of the fastest-growing businesses across Alphabet.”  Google has been emphasizing on enterprise clients in this area, along with the G Suite service. “I think everyone really appreciated seeing large customers, very sophisticated customers, like HSBC, eBay, Colgate-Palmolive, et cetera, discussing use of Google Cloud, GCP,” Pichai said. “In general, I think there is a very strong recognition that we are have pivoted to being a deep enterprise company, and our conversations are very strategic. We are engaging at the highest levels within companies.” Similar to Amazon’s AWS cloud service, Google Cloud Platform is shaping up to be one of Alphabet’s most profitable arms. Since cloud services attract medium and large-sized enterprise clients, like the ones mentioned above, the scale of operations is very profitable. Pichai said that there was “tremendous momentum” in education, and that Google was leading the industry in that field. “Chromebooks are now used by more than 20 million teachers and students, and more than 70 million people actively use G Suite for Education,” he said. Waymo Waymo is Google’s self-driving car arm that was spun off into its own company as part of Alphabet’s restructuring last year. Waymo is only performing trials in one area in the US right now. CEO Pichai said in the earnings call that they are testing Waymo technology on “enabling ridesharing, personal-use vehicles, logistics, and deliveries”. Pichai added that Waymo is also exploring ways to work with individual cities to address public transport problems. Waymo’s ridesharing efforts would compete with established players like Uber and Lyft in the US, the former of which introduced a fleet of autonomous cars last year. Search & Maps Google Maps has seen strong growth especially in emerging markets, Pichai said. He indicated that Maps would play a role in future Augmented Reality (AR) efforts, in the long term. Maps has also been optimising information based on user location and movement. “If you open Google Maps, you’re traveling or you’re out on a Friday evening, we start surfacing a lot more interesting information about what you can do, places to eat, and so on,” Pichai said. In Search, the company added tappable shortcuts last month on mobile apps, adding direct icons leading to results on popular topics.

Credit: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg Most Popular Facebook has been in the test phase of selling ads through Apple TV, Roku and a lineup of partner apps that populate those so-called over-the-top platforms. But the social network is struggling to sign up more partners, according to a number of people familiar with Facebook's online TV offering. The obstacles for Facebook breaking into digital TV include the fact that many of the studios and networks are reluctant to hand over any bit of their video ad business to the increasingly powerful player. "Facebook has come in to give the ad tech pitch, but at the end of the day they want us to dump our ad tech and back-end system for theirs," said one top media executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Facebook said its connected TV -- just like its desktop and mobile ad products -- has been designed to make it easy for apps to plug into it as just another demand source for ads. Also, Facebook decided not to build a traditional ad tech platform that would compete with media partners' existing technology and partnerships. Also, a Facebook rep said the company is not pitching connected TV as a replacement for partners' infrastructure that's already in use. Facebook is reaching for more ad inventory in TV-like settings as a way to keep up with Google, which recently launched YouTube TV, a streamlined internet TV package with stations like ESPN, FX, AMC and other cable channels and networks on board. Facebook has ambitions to compete with Google by getting a broader foothold outside its properties, but has had to rethink its strategy after acquisitions of Live Rail and Atlas did not work as originally planned. For instance, Facebook said it found the open internet drowning in low quality ad inventory when it fired up Live Rail, a video ad server. Last year, companies like Hulu, A&E Networks and Major League Baseball had to go looking for new technology when Facebook shut it down. Related Stories Google Sees Another Chance to Get Programmatic TV Right Since then, Facebook has been putting its efforts toward the Facebook Audience Network, which promises the same ad targeting precision the social network offers on its own site. A&E Networks, for one, was part of the beta program to open ad inventory in its app and websites to the audience network, and has been a steadfast partner when it comes to trying out the new technology. A&E Networks declined comment for this story. However, one person familiar with the tests said it has been going well, and even expanding. More A&E properties like History channel and FYI now show Facebook ads through the tests. A Facebook rep said the company declined to comment beyond what it said since August. "We are testing how to best deliver video ads through Audience Network to people watching content on connected TVs," the Facebook spokesman said. "Our goal is to bring relevant ad experiences to people both on Facebook and off." It's always an obstacle convincing publishers and digital media properties to overhaul their ad tech pipes after they already invested in their own systems. Facebook has an even harder time because of its dominance in online ads and its tight control of its audience network. Advertisers can choose categories of content but not specific publishers or media properties to run on. And publishers can select categories of sponsors but not specific advertisers. Of course, the media partners can also see advertisers connected to their content when it runs. Facebook has said that's to the benefit of media partners, so advertisers don't go looking to buy ads on their properties through Facebook, and they keep their direct relationships. It's unclear how that process changes in the over-the-top TV program, but partners are pushing for as much control over their inventory as possible, according to a person familiar with the concerns. It's a crucial time in the connected TV space, and Facebook could be up against a clock to offer a more developed product. Many companies like Turner, Viacom and Hulu are building their own ad technology to serve ads across platforms and screens. "Facebook is another one of those companies you don't want to be more beholden to than you have to," said an executive from a competing ad tech company.

In the golden age of attorneys before the 1977 Bates v State Bar of Arizona Supreme Court decision made lawyer advertising legal, practice marketing comprised word of mouth, actual social networking and other first-person methods. But since then ads and a host of other mainstream marketing methods became available to the legal profession. So which ones should an IP firm employ in the search for new clients? Which might be advisable to avoid? How much of this should happen in-house or get outsourced? Let’s take a look. All Legal Marketing is Local SEO? A famous adage counsels that all politics is local, meaning that solutions to problems have the most effect close to home. As a corollary, a retail channel marketing outreach to IP clients could serve IP firms as well. And on the internet, local search engine optimization (SEO) for IP boutiques, arguably specialist SMBs and solopreneurs, presents a new golden opportunity, according to some experts. For example, Google has a section called the Local Pack that displays search results close to the user. But like all things Google SEO, it always changes. “Over the years, Local Pack became a precious slice of real estate for attorneys and law firms, since inclusion is free and the map listings appear prominently at the top of search results,” says Brandon Seymour, founder, Beymour Consulting, a digital marketing agency specializing in search, branding and reputation management. “In 2015, Google reduced the total number of Local Pack listings from seven to three, meaning Local Pack visibility has become drastically more competitive. Recently, Google announced it would start showing ads within Local Pack, which could mean even less visibility for local businesses.” For 2017, Beymour recommends that IP practitioners establish their free Google My Business listing and invest in SEO for their websites to rank in local search results. Factors to consider include backlinks to your site from legitimate sources (e.g. chamber of commerce, Better Business Bureau), high-quality images (e.g., logo, profile photo, homepage picture), real Google reviews from satisfied clients and anchor text that uses your keywords. It’s a Mobile World, Your Site Needs to Move in it Among professionals, those practicing law may most understand the necessity to access the internet from a smartphone, tablet or laptop. Whether from court, an administrative site or on the road, they do not seem to use their desktop computers as much anymore. In general, mobile internet traffic began to exceed PC volume in 2014. Google followed suit in 2015 with its mobile algorithm change that ranks mobile-friendly pages higher in search engine results. And so IP lawyers need to ensure their sites have client mobility in mind, according to digital marketing experts. “If a website isn’t mobile-friendly, it’s an issue,” says Michael Mignogna, CEO, Minyona, a boutique digital marketing agency. “Add to that including contact information—phone number, contact form—on the homepage for view on mobile devices, and the results are fantastic. For many attorneys, new clients come by word of mouth, so when those people find the website, it’s important that they can easily reach out.” Establishing a quality website that has a mobile responsive design and loads fast will do a lot for an IP firm seeking a high SEO ranking. And it should be done before spending thousands of dollars a month on other types of marketing, according to Mignogna. “All our law clients have benefited from simply having a beautiful, simple-to-use website that is mobile friendly,” Mignogna says. Blogging, Email Newsletters and other Content Marketing All the writing IP lawyers do, such as crafting patents and trade secrets and enforceable non-compete agreements, does little to prepare them for content marketing. Realistically, their day jobs keep them too busy with no time left for inbound activities. So outside help could be a no-brainer. “Outsourcing can work for all types of law firms if done correctly,” says Kelly Jamrozy, owner, KBJ Writing, a content writing company that helps businesses build their online presence. “Small law firms with a small budget just need to temper their expectations. There are agencies that can help them with marketing, just as there are for larger firms with larger budgets. The only time I might not recommend outsourcing  for a firm with an unpredictable budget that has someone on staff with marketing experience.” And for outsourced content for attorneys, a general strategy that proves economical comes down to repurposing material, according to Jamrozy. “Many of my clients use newsletters, and in some cases, just refashion their old blogs into monthly emails,” she says. As an example, MyBrandMark.com, a law firm specializing in trademarks and patents, conducts all its marketing online but finds email marketing its most successful promotion, according to Michael Pesochinsky, firm owner and attorney. It’s even superior to using Google AdWords or issuing press releases through PR firms, tactics MyBrandMark.com also uses, according to Pesochinsky. However, one of the main objectives of blogging for an IP law firm should remain to establish the bylined attorney-author as an authority in the industry, according to Jamrozy. This has the equally important effect of educating prospective clientele, she believes. For MyBrandMark.com, Pesochinsky makes it his mission to establish an identity apart from filing services, which just fill out government forms, as he puts it. “We make it clear to customers that we are not just a filing service, we are a law firm with licensed attorneys,” Pesochinsky says. “Unlike filing services, we can provide them with sound legal advice and correct issues. Getting potential clients to understand exactly what they are paying for is essential.” And it goes to prove that blogging is one of the most powerful tools available to attorneys, according to Jamrozy. They Will Not Necessarily Read it if you Blog it While blogging remains a potent implement for awareness building and SEO, by itself it cannot succeed. If your content marketing has a foundation built on the Field of Dreams model so that if you build it clients will read it and contact you, get ready for disappointment. Without a content distribution strategy, they will not come. You need to have your content duplicated and disseminated by surrogates in multiple channels to succeed, according to legal marketing experts. “Law firms need to use a process known as marketing gravity to help articulate their value and become a brand,” says Drew Stevens, Ph.D., president, Stevens Consulting, which focuses on business growth strategies for law firms. “Marketing gravity is a systematic integrated process of online and traditional media that aids a law firm with establishing its presence in the community. Most importantly, the value requires reproduction so those who understand and appreciate it tell others.” For example, Apple has a strong community behind its brand, Stevens notes. And in that case, the community has become a marketing avatar that provides amplification and distribution for the brand, taking Stevens’ point to its logical conclusion. However, content marketing is a long game strategy that requires sustainment to maximize its effectiveness. Think of it in terms of a magazine or newspaper. The regularity with which they come out creates an expectation, memorableness, and credibility in the minds of the readers. If your IP firm only produces content sporadically, that diminishes its impact dramatically. “Many create marketing content, but this is not the same thing as publishing ideas with utility, consistently over time,” says Frank Strong, founder and president, Sword and the Script Media, a content marketing and social media agency. “These build engagement, trust and subscribers that lead to clients.” For example, Strong claims this is how he built the LexisNexis Business of Law Blog into an industry leader. “Content marketing can work very well for law firms that do it properly,” he says. Social Media Distribution for IP Practices To distribute content, one of the first methods IP practices should pursue remains social media. Marketing professionals who work with law firms can recommend a range of platforms including standbys Facebook and Twitter. Any content marketing strategy should incorporate those outlets, but depending on its formulation additional networks could help, according to the experts. For example, some firms have Facebook and Instagram pages and schedule content from twice a week to every day, as well as manage Facebook advertising, according to Sean Azari, principal, Breakthrough Social, creative ad and branding specialist for a variety of businesses including law firms. And Azari not only talks the talk but also walks the walk, having produced a YouTube video on how lawyers can use social media to promote their brands. And IP firms can even gain by using social media to promote large events that not only appeal to a big cross-section of the populace but also interest niche audiences. For example, consider Santucci Priore, P.L., an intellectual property law firm, which represents the Ultra Music Festival in Miami, the most famous electronic music festival in the world, according to Michael Santucci, managing partner. As academic scholars have noticed, electronic music poses legal risks to producers regarding copyright infringement, so those actively involved with the Ultra Music Festival would have an intrinsic interest in knowing how to avoid them. Then it makes sense they could be prospective clients for Santucci Priore. To drive awareness and engagement, the firm held a sweepstake for three-day passes to the festival via the web and social media, especially Facebook and Twitter. The results: more than 1,000 visitors to the firm’s site in February 2017 alone. “Using social media has been a great way for us to get our name out there to the people that need our services the most for a fraction of what it costs to advertise using other channels, such as pay per click or print collateral,” Santucci says. “Getting people involved and interacting with our firm, our clients and the unique issues we raise is an honest and organic way to maintain and build our brand.” The Author Derek Handova is a project-based corporate content marketer and freelance journalist who has contributed to TechCrunch, B2B News Network, Talkin Cloud, Intelligent Utility, Economy Lead and InfotechLead.

(Source: Wikimedia Commons) Google is preparing to introduce an ad-blocker to Chrome browser despite fears that it would hit their online advertising revenues — a move that has been hailed by publishers in the US and Europe, the Financial Times reported. The move comes after Google was recently criticised for placement of ads on its video hosting platform YouTube. In March this year, several major brands boycotted YouTube and have their ads out from the platform as they protested the placement of ads which were appearing next to offensive content, including videos posted by terrorism-affiliated groups. According to the experts, the boycott could cost YouTube’s parent company Google nearly $750 million in revenue.Google, at that time, promised that it was taking steps to deal with the problem and the move to introduce ad-blockers in Chrome seems one of the steps the company has taken to resolve the issue. Details of the plan have not been disclosed but Google has said it held “initial conversations” on the idea with publishers.According to NetMarketShare — a company that provides market share statistics for internet technologies — Chrome is a dominant player in the internet browsing market with a near 60 per cent share. “The blocker would be likely to target certain types of ads that have been found to frustrate readers, such as pop-ups and auto-playing videos,” the Financial Times report said on Sunday.

Twitter Facebook Google offers voice and language SDK for Google Assistant Developers can create hardware prototypes that allow for spoken queries and responses IDG Paul Krill (InfoWorld) 01 May, 2017 20:00 - - - - print email Comments Google is now offering a software development kit for its Google Assistant platform so that developers can build hardware prototypes that use the technology. The SDK enables developers to create devices that allow users to talk to them and get questions answered. Still in a preview form, the kit includes a gRPC API, a Python open source client to handle authentication and access to the API, samples, and documentation. There are gRPC API and bindings for languages like Java, Python, C#, Node.js, and Ruby. [ The art of programming moves rapidly. InfoWorld helps you navigate what’s running hot and what's going cold. | Keep up with main topics in programming with InfoWorld’s App Dev Report newsletter. ] "The SDK allows you to capture a spoken query, for example 'what's on my calendar?', pass that up to the Google Assistant service, and receive an audio response," according to a bulletin posted by Google. "And while it's ideal for prototyping on Raspberry Pi devices, it also adds support for many other platforms." Features still remain to be built, however, including hot-word support and companion app integration. "We've created a new developer community on Google+ at g.co/assistantsdkdev for developers to keep up to date and discuss ideas," Google said. "There is also a stackoverflow tag [google-assistant-sdk] for questions, and a mailing list to keep up to date on SDK news.” Google Assistant brings capabilities like natural language understanding and voice control to devices. The technology was made available for some Android smartphones earlier this year. Network Professionals Survey with Computerworld Australia More from Computerworld Join the Computerworld newsletter!

The SDK enables developers to create devices that allow users to talk to them and get questions answered. Still in a preview form, the kit includes a gRPC API, a Python open source client to handle authentication and access to the API, samples, and documentation. There are gRPC API and bindings for languages like Java, Python, C#, Node.js, and Ruby. [ The art of programming moves rapidly. InfoWorld helps you navigate what’s running hot and what's going cold. | Keep up with main topics in programming with InfoWorld’s App Dev Report newsletter. ] "The SDK allows you to capture a spoken query, for example 'what's on my calendar?', pass that up to the Google Assistant service, and receive an audio response," according to a bulletin posted by Google. "And while it's ideal for prototyping on Raspberry Pi devices, it also adds support for many other platforms." Features still remain to be built, however, including hot-word support and companion app integration. "We've created a new developer community on Google+ at g.co/assistantsdkdev for developers to keep up to date and discuss ideas," Google said. "There is also a stackoverflow tag [google-assistant-sdk] for questions, and a mailing list to keep up to date on SDK news.” Google Assistant brings capabilities like natural language understanding and voice control to devices. The technology was made available for some Android smartphones earlier this year.

The Nexus Suite helps scale your DevOps delivery with continuous component intelligence integrated into development tools, including Eclipse, IntelliJ, Jenkins, Bamboo, SonarQube and more. Schedule a demo today.  Software intelligence is a full-stack monitoring platform that discovers, diagnoses, and helps you resolve software issues both in production, and those affecting end users. Instead of using disparate monitoring tools that don’t communicate with each other, software intelligence combines features like crash reporting, real user monitoring, deployment tracking, and user tracking to build a more ‘intelligent’ view of your overall software health. By using local agents or a small piece of code, software intelligence focuses directly on understanding the activity of your application, providing your team with valuable insights into the overall health of your software. How is Software Intelligence Different From Business Intelligence Software? The best answer is they both have different functions and are not related, but can be used side by side. While business intelligence software (or BI) analyzes day to day business metrics and trends, software intelligence provides actionable data on how your application is performing in real time. In the same way a company uses BI to coagulate disparate spreadsheeting and resource management tools, software intelligence combines several monitoring tools into one platform. By reducing the amount of tools you need, software intelligence makes your technology stack much neater and more efficient at communicating.   How Does it Help Your Team? From server-side crashes to slow-performing pages and discovering bad deployments, software intelligence is a top down view of issues affecting end users. It offers insights into backend, front end, and server level issues in real time – as they are affecting your end users – right now. A cornerstone of a software intelligence platform is that it is able to identify when a user has taken actions that have resulted in an unhandled exception. Using features like crash reporting’s breadcrumbs, developers are able to see what exactly what happened leading up to the crash. Real user monitoring gives the who, with data on load times and live sessions (shown below in the Raygun platform): The issue can then be identified and brought to a developer’s attention within seconds using integrations with ChatOps and task management software such as JIRA. Detailed diagnostic details, including the stack trace information, are then made available to the developer in order to replicate the issue quickly, fix it, and deploy the update to production. The issue is then resolved before it affects any further users, who otherwise would have run into the same problem. The same is true for issues that aren’t triggered by a user. With software intelligence in place, if a database time-outs, or poorly executed code triggers errors in backend systems, it is picked up immediately. Developers can then fix up these issues before any users are affected. Understanding the components of software intelligence All software has problems – in fact, ‘zero bug’ software is not the aim. You’ll find that it’s how those problems are handled that set development teams apart. In traditional team settings, multiple teams are involved in the detection and resolution of software problems. This inevitably leads to a breakdown in communication and possible confusion in your team.  Software intelligence aims to breaks down these communication walls by leveraging integrations with ChatOps and deployment software to automate low-value work (like looking through log files). A software intelligence platform has the following key characteristics that all work together:  Crash reporting. Real user monitoring. Deployment tracking. User tracking. Let’s go into detail below. Crash Reporting: Discover What Happened and When  Generally speaking, only 1% of users report errors and issues with their software. Crash reporting uses an SDK piece of code to continually monitor both web and mobile applications to collect detailed diagnostics on any crashes and errors that are happening – in real time – including a detailed stack trace. Crash reporting software aims to give context to developers around the root cause of issues for faster triage and resolution. Without crash reporting, developers rely on reproducing issues manually – a time-intensive and sometimes fruitless process. Crash reporting software answers questions like: Just how many software errors and crashes do our software applications have? Where exactly in our codebase is the problem stemming from? When we made a deployment, did it improve things or create a new problem? Which team members are introducing and solving the most issues? How is our application performing for end users in production?   When paired with real user monitoring, deployment tracking, and user tracking, crash reporting data gains more context. For example, you will be able to send an email to the individuals who experienced the crash without them having to report the error. This can be especially important when improving the customer’s perceived value of your software. Even though they are online, they still get personal attention. If you have a business goal of improving customer service across your company, this could be a vital differentiator to success. Real User Monitoring: Discover Performance Problems  To explain real user monitoring (or RUM), the most familiar and common comparison is with Google Analytics. Google Analytics monitors a variety of basic user interactions, including time on page and how many visitors you are getting. Google Analytics was originally built for small to medium sized retail businesses, therefore it lacks certain insights for complex enterprise websites. For example, Google Analytics relies on cookies, so if anyone has disabled them in their browser, the information is lost. Google also sample their data rather than analyzing all available data, simply for convenience and scale. This works well for a generalized view of how your website is performing, however, professional developers generally need more specialized tools to drill down into the location and cause of performance problems. Furthermore, some security experts have raised concerns about privacy issues in Google Analytics. Through the Google Analytics Dashboard, users can collect information on people whose websites link to social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter. Real user monitoring, on the other hand, tracks individual people, not just data. When used as part of a software intelligence platform like Raygun, RUM should also be HIPAA compliant, so there are little to no security risks around sensitive data. RUM specifically allows you to drill into individual sessions to see what the user’s navigation path was. This includes device details, operating system, location and where they encountered problems. With Raygun, for example, the data is collected using the user’s browser. The IP address is used to determine the location of the customer, but that data is never stored. This micro-level view allows software professionals to answer questions like: Where exactly did a user encounter a slow-loading page? What caused the problem to happen to this user? What was their journey path before encountering the problem? Was their whole session poor or just a single page/view? Was their device, connection speed, or location a factor? When combined with crash reporting, user tracking, and deployment tracking, real user monitoring can give all sorts of diagnostic details on how decisions you made during production are affecting your users in real time. These aren’t vanity metrics either – page load speed really affects your bottom line. Pinterest is one Fortune 500 company that directly attributes ‘their biggest user acquisition win’  to discovering and fixing performance issues affecting end users. Amazon also followed suit quickly when they discovered that addressing performance problems in their software was the most lucrative way to make improvements to their software. Deployment Tracking: Spot Bad Deployments The deployment process is the biggest pain point for 29% of software professionals using a continuous delivery model. Deployment tracking helps to directly address errors in deployment by surfacing them quickly alongside error charts. Most organizations use multiple testing environments before release. Only after each environment passes the requirements for each stage does it get moved to the next. If the deployment is rejected, it gets rolled back to the previous phase and starts again with developers correcting any defects found. The more defects that are found and fixed, the more stable the software becomes. Deployment tracking helps to track deployments through the multiple test environments, automatically discovering errors aiding software developers in building more robust and stable software. Software intelligence, in turn, uses deployment tracking to deliver data on which deployments caused which errors, and how they are being received by end users. Therefore a strategic decision can be made to either fix the errors or roll back a release. Deployment tracking is mainly designed to give teams peace of mind that problematic deployments are picked up immediately – including the commits that made them.    User Tracking: It’s About People, Not Numbers User tracking connects crash reporting data to the data collected by real user monitoring and is a key component of software intelligence. User tracking is specifically designed to provide a way for organizations to effectively do damage control for performance issues that have already affected an end user. When a large outage affects thousands of customers, it’s standard practice to send an email to the customer base, or even to publicly release a statement to apologize. User tracking offers a more elegant way to manage the damage control by making use of custom segments. This segment of email addresses can then be handed off to marketing or customer support. This way, businesses need only communicate recent outages to those that were impacted, saving notifying the entire user base and running the risk of a wider loss of confidence than is necessary. Does My Company Need Software Intelligence? With a plethora of monitoring tools on the market, it can be confusing for businesses to make purchasing decisions and deliver strong business cases for implementing application monitoring. However, when we start to think about the direct benefits to the business (especially large scale software projects in enterprise), it’s much easier justify the implementation of a tool like a software intelligence platform. Software errors and performance problems cost money and can be the death of an application. For example, software intelligence complements many business goals, including: Migrating to cloud services. Moving to microservice architecture. Migrating old enterprise systems. Improving customer response times. Creating multi-platform software. Creating agile systems. More vitally, software intelligence provides the data needed to measure these goals. The software intelligence platform does the heavy lifting, then presents data in a way that is easy to digest: Limitations of a Software Intelligence Platform If you are looking simply for a crash reporting solution for an IOS mobile application, software intelligence may not be the right solution (unless you build multiple applications for an agency). In this case, an open source crash reporting tool could be the best option.   The Future of Software Intelligence At the end of the day, all monitoring tools must be able to offer detailed information about end users, and implementing any tool must be weighed against real business objectives. Depending on your business needs, you may just need a light solution such as Google Analytics or an open source logging tool. However, businesses need to focus on high-value activities in order to reduce spend and drive forward with business goals. To achieve and maintain balance in a software development team, the data you receive is only as good as how effectively your team responds. Therefore, thorough data presented with actionable insights will lead the way for all business software. This is precisely why Raygun built our platform with software intelligence at the front of mind. Tools like crash reporting and real user monitoring are more powerful when they work together to provide a holistic view of how software quality affects real people and their experiences. Directly linking software quality to ROI is a pipe dream for so many businesses. Software businesses reliant on healthy software to make revenue fly blind without software intelligence, and issues that affect end users just never get addressed.

Join For Free Build APIs from SQL and NoSQL or Salesforce data sources in seconds. Read the Creating REST APIs white paper, brought to you in partnership with CA Technologies. I'm always learning from the API pioneers, and trying to understand how they are pushing forward the API conversation. I'm neck deep in profiling AWS APIs, as well as Google APIs. One common pattern I'm seeing across both providers is the support for API access in both Visual Studio and Eclipse IDEs.  Google is helping developers find APIs within both of the leading IDE platforms. They have long had some Eclipse plugins for their API infrastructure, but I recently noticed they also have a pretty robust solution for Visual Studio developers. The Google APIs .NET library is made available in Visual Studio using the NuGet package manager, opening up access to a significant portion of their API stack. Amazon also provides Eclipse and Visual Studio tooling as part of their AWS toolbox, opening up access to the AWS API catalog to developers in the IDE they are are using to build their applications and craft their system integrations. I don't know how much time you've spent looking through the AWS catalog, but it can be a timesucker- giving me access to APIs in my native environment makes a lot of sense. I feel like API innovation in the IDE is right there with API integration into our continuous integration workflows and the usage of Github. You shouldn't have to depend on Google to find your APIs; they should be right at your fingertips in your IDE, no matter whether they are for your applications, or for managing your API operations. All your internal and third party APIs should be baked into your development, and continuous integration environments, allowing you to orchestrate exactly the application experience, and life cycle you desire. This is just one of the fronts I'd like to see API discovery evolve in coming years, reaching developers with new APIs and paths during design and development, as well as across continuous integration stages of our work.

SECTIONS Home Market Companies Economy Tech Auto Mutual Funds Stocks Currency Opinions Todays Paper E-Paper Horoscope Photos Video Photo Story Home Industry Technology US tech’s self-feeding digital money machine on show this week US tech’s self-feeding digital money machine on show this week For advertisers, Google’s large online audience makes it one of the first places to go to run online marketing campaigns. The other is Facebook. By: Bloomberg | Published: May 1, 2017 2:27 PM Apple Inc. and Facebook Inc. will in the coming days add evidence that tech behemoths command an ever widening share of consumer time and spending. (Reuters) Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. posted results last week that extended their dominance of how we shop and search online. Apple Inc. and Facebook Inc. will in the coming days add evidence that tech behemoths command an ever widening share of consumer time and spending. Amazon’s revenue soared as shoppers favored it over brick-and-mortar stores, while Google parent Alphabet reported surging quarterly profit that highlighted the ubiquity of its search advertising business — especially on smartphones. “Each has built unique moats that allow them to continue to dominate,” said Ben Schachter, an analyst at Macquarie. “For Google, no one can catch them on search because of the technology and intellectual property. For Amazon, scale is their friend and no one can compete on selection, price and fulfillment capabilities.” The companies have vast networks of complementary products that feed off one another to generate more sales, making it ever harder for competitors to keep up. “Given the strength of Google and Amazon, we think Facebook is likely to look similar,” Schachter said. On Wednesday, Facebook is expected to report first-quarter profit of $2.57 billion, up 70 percent from a year earlier, while revenue climbs 45 percent to $7.82 billion, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. When Apple reports fiscal second-quarter earnings on Tuesday, sales are expected to climb 5 percent to $53 billion. Revenue from the App Store and other services such as Apple Music will likely jump 20 percent to $7.2 billion, according to UBS analyst Steven Milunovich. “The general theme that the big are getting bigger” applies to Apple’s self-feeding ecosystem, Schachter said. Every time Apple sells an iPhone, the customer buys apps and other services, feeding data such as photos and contacts into the device, making it harder to swap for a competitor’s device. Higher margin service revenue then feeds back into Apple’s development budget, helping it build more advanced products to sell to the same consumer. Google’s advertising business is very different, but has similar self-feeding qualities. The company got 97 percent of mobile paid search clicks in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2017, according to client data from digital marketing firm Merkle Inc. That was up from 82 percent in the same period in 2014. With more searches, Google gets more ad dollars to reinvest to keep its search engine ahead of the competition — mostly represented by Microsoft Corp.’s Bing. Google also gets more data on what results people click on, which can be used to improve its software even more, and keep people coming back to find information. “There are clear benefits to that scale,” Mark Ballard, senior director of research at Merkle, said. “There’s that feedback loop.” For advertisers, Google’s large online audience makes it one of the first places to go to run online marketing campaigns. The other is Facebook. Merkle client spending on Facebook ads was up 71 percent in the first quarter, from a year earlier. These advertisers get about 70 percent of their online traffic from Facebook and that hasn’t changed in recent years despite the rise of competitors like Snap Inc., Ballard noted. Facebook and Google captured 77 percent of U.S. digital ad spending last year, up from 72 percent in 2015, according to a recent analysis of data from the Interactive Advertising Bureau by Pivotal Research Group. For advertisers it’s “easier to concentrate budgets with a smaller number of players. It’s easier to manage,” said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal. Marketers have long griped about the “duopoly” atop digital advertising. But they keep giving Google and Facebook money. That’s largely because few other places offer wide reach, channels for targeting consumers and better returns. Those advantages only multiply as the tech companies expand. Verizon Communications Inc.’s new Oath ad business “may figure out a special sauce, but they will never be the first port of call,” Wieser said. When Google and Facebook get those calls first, they see what advertisers plan to spend elsewhere and can sell them other services and tools, according to the analyst. Advertisers disagree about what company could offer a viable third alternative. Some suggest another internet titan: Amazon. The largest online retailer isn’t a leading digital advertising destination yet, but on its earnings call last week, Chief Financial Officer Brian Oslavsky reported “consistent growth” from that business. Research firm EMarketer expects the company to generate more display ad revenue than Twitter Inc. by next year. Even so, most of Amazon’s first-quarter revenue gains came from grabbing retail market share as more people shop online, rather than in stores. That shift is fueling a record pace of retailer bankruptcies this year, despite a growing U.S. economy and solid consumer spending. What began with bookstores, movie rental outlets and electronics retailers like Borders, Blockbuster and Circuit City, is spreading to apparel and sporting goods chains like Aeropostale Inc. and Sports Authority Holdings Inc. Once online spending in a category passes 20 percent, it’s tough for brick-and-mortar retailers to survive and easy for Amazon to gobble up market share, said Guru Hariharan, chief executive officer of Boomerang Commerce Inc., which designs software for large retailers. Amazon has been disciplined about only pursuing retail categories that are already shifting online, giving it momentum against competitors playing defense, he said, adding that more apparel bankruptcies will come in the next two years. Like Google, which has introduced the Pixel smartphone to help secure its direct relationship with consumers, Amazon has introduced the Echo smart speaker to encourage customers to buy services and products from its website. The software makers are expanding into hardware to feed their money machines. No Comments.

Is Derby in London? What does it mean to be Derby? These are just some of the bizarre questions posed by thousands of people on the search engine we have all come to know and love - Google. The power of Google has changed our lives allowing us to ask questions galore at the touch of a button about anything and everything. And we ask! Quite a lot actually. That's why whenever you start typing a question into Google a host of other popular search terms pop up. They are the most popular questions asked on Google by people from around the world. READ MORE: 11 quirky things we love that Derby people say or do Google, the largest collection of human knowledge in history, offers an unprecedented encyclopedia of wisdom which has mesmerised the world - or anyone with a computer anyway. Whether you want to know about some complex piece of history or Derbyshire auctioneer Charles Hanson's age or shoe size (because he's on telly again), Google can help. But what happens when we turn this powerful technological tool on Derby? What secrets are revealed? In short: what are people Googling about Derby and why? Well, here for your delectation is the answer to that question: Why does Derby... Well, at least the ram question and belly come before questions posed by fans of pop band One Direction and Niall Horan. In case you don't know, The Derby Ram is a traditional folk song about a ram of gargantuan proportions and the difficulties that posed when it came to butchering the creature. Why does Derby mean belly? Well, Derby Kelly is Cockney rhyming slang for belly. Obvious, eh?! Why does singer Niall (Horan of One Direction fame) support Derby. It's because his dad, Bobby, has been a fan since the Brian Clough era and took Niall to his first Rams game when he was four. Is Derby in the.. This is a thorny question - particularly for Derby people, some of whom have been known to get quite ratty when told they live in the north. But, as you can see, many people are still pretty confused. As everyone with half a brain knows, we are neither northerners and definitely not southerners. We are MIDLANDERS and, with us, you get the best of both worlds. Brilliant dry, sardonic wit but absolutely no snobbery. And we have a bath, not a baaarth! And, yes, believe it or not - people are also asking Google: Is Derby in Yorkshire? Is Derby in London? ON THIS TOPIC: Yet more Derby-related Google questions answered Derby is... The Google prompts when you type in 'Derby is ...' may seem a tad disturbing but you can't win 'em all. After all, Derby has been linked to Islamic terrorism on a few occasions and it's also been caught up in an ongoing row about whether it is, or isn't, a dump. What we reckon is that every Midlands town has its rough spots, us included, and beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Is Derby ... Is Derby in burglary hotspot? No, not really but people thinking of moving to the area are bound to ask. The 'Is Derby a city?' question is a tad annoying as we received our city status way back in 1977. That is nearly 40 years ago and people are STILL asking. As for that thorny geography question, what is so hard about looking at a map of the UK? READ MORE: Why do people insist on calling Derby a town? Where in Derby... The poppy question refers to the magnificent display of thousands of ceramic poppies, made at Pride Park in Derby for a display at the Tower Of London. The installation, called Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red, marked the centenary of the outbreak of the First World War. Created by Derby artist Paul Cummins and Tom Piper, 888,246 ceramic poppies progressively filled the Tower's famous moat between July and November 2014, each representing a life lost in war. Ugg boots? Well, we can only assume we have lots of fashionistas in these parts. Geography crops up yet again in the third question and as for the 'clause', that appears to be technical computer terminology. READ MORE: See video which shows how Weeping Window ceramic poppies will look in Derby Is Derby a good None of the above need any explanation. Most of these questions come from people who are either applying for a place at the University of Derby or moving to the area. They want to know if our city can cut it on the leisure and entertainment front. We can, of course. At least no-one is asking is Derby a good ... "northern town"! Is Derby good for... Again, it's clear many would-be University of Derby students pose these questions on a regular basis. At least it's nice to see the city's engineering pedigree coming to the fore, and it's law school is clearly gaining recognition. Plus, we can promise any newbies a decent night out and plenty of shopping options too. But thanks for asking. Derby has... This one came as a surprise. We expected Derby has ... a cathedral, a great football team, many parks, the famous Clough family. But hats? We have our American friends to thank for this as they call a bowler hat a derby hat. Apparently, a chain of restaurants in Los Angeles, California, is known as The Brown Derby and the first and most famous of these was shaped like a derby (bowler) hat - see below! READ MORE: Words that sound or look the same as Derby - but mean something else! What's Derby... 'What's Derby like' is a popular Google search. A young Australian who posed this very question on Tripadvisor after being offered a job here was told by a local: "Derbyshire folk are friendly and welcoming. I think it is a good place to live. Downside ... It can be cold, wet and generally grey but that is UK weather ... and we do have summer sometimes!" Another less than flattering answer that comes up when you ask, 'What's Derby Like' has been posted by an anonymous (not surprising due to the content) contributor to a random website. They wrote: "The Derby chav has two outfits, his daytime gear consists of a Kappa tracksuit with Carbrini hoody, or one of those tops covered in white scribbles. He also wears the notorious Burberry cap either peaked upwards or positioned either to the left or right. At night he wears faded jeans and a Ben Sherman top." The post gets more and more insulting so we'll leave it there... The final question on the list above refers to Derby County, of course. FAME AND FORTUNE: Made in Derby and Derbyshire: 14 great inventions from the hotdog to Lara Croft What does Derby... The first question, above, is an interesting one: What does Derby mean? As well as being an alternative name for a bowler hat, Derby is the name of an annual horse race at Epsom, which was founded in 1780 by the 12th Earl of Derby. Derby day? Well, that's a sporting event featuring local rivals and, if you've been paying attention, you will already know what Derby means in Cockney slang. How is Derby... Pronouncing the name of our fair city, and county, appears to cause some people major problems. Still, it's polite of them to to ask how they should say it. Americans in particular struggle with the pronunciation of Derby but, thankfully, a YouTube tutorial exists (below) to help them grapple with British place-name tongue twisters, including Derby. One day we'll never have to say Derby is pronounced DARBY ever again. LOOKING FOR A NEW JOB?

"The blocker would be likely to target certain types of ads that have been found to frustrate readers, such as pop-ups and auto-playing videos," the Financial Times report said on Sunday.

A quick conversion into INR reveals that he earned more than 1,280 crore rupees last year. This is third straight year Sunder Pichai has got a salary in the nine-figures - a feat that is virtually unheard of even in the top companies of the world. In order to "encourage executives to take a long-term view of the business", Google employs a strategy of granting equity awards to top bosses every two years.

However, a software engineer from Google decided to experiment by pushing the limits when it came to cell phone cameras. Posting on the Google Research Blog earlier in April, Florian Kainz, a software engineer from Google Daydream, wrote about one night last year when he carried a DSLR [digital single-lens reflex] camera, heavy lens and tripod up a hilltop. His goal: to capture the Golden Gate Bridge and the lights of the city behind it. He was then challenged by a fellow researcher to get the same effects using a phone camera. Kainz accepted the challenge. “To learn what was possible with a cell phone camera in extremely low-light conditions, I looked to the experimental SeeInTheDark app, written by Marc Levoy and presented at the ICCV 2015 Extreme Imaging Workshop, which can produce pictures with even less light than HDR+. It does this by accumulating more exposures, and merging them under the assumption that the scene is static and any differences between successive exposures must be due to camera motion or sensor noise. The app reduces noise further by dropping image resolution to about 1 megapixel. With SeeInTheDark it is just possible to take pictures, albeit fairly grainy ones, by the light of the full moon. To test the app, he went to the Point Reyes lighthouse on the California coast on a full moon night. "When the shutter button is pressed the app waits a few seconds and then records up to 64 frames with the selected settings. The app saves the raw frames captured from the sensor as Digital Negative Graphics (DNG) files, which can later be downloaded onto a PC for processing." He used a Nexus 6P phone. He shot a burst of 32 four-second frames at ISO 1600. Then he shot an additional 32 black frames after covering the camera lens with opaque adhesive tape. He loaded the raw files into Photoshop when he got back to the office. He showed he resulting image, on the blog; he thought it looked "surprisingly good." with "pleasing, natural looking colours." “I showed some more shots, but his curiosity was not satisfied. What about using even less light, I asked myself. The pictures I had shown were shot on nights with a full moon, but now I wanted to see what could be achieved with less light,” he wrote. "Using a Pixel phone, I tried a scene illuminated by a three-quarter moon low in the sky, and another one with no moon at all. Anticipating more noise in the individual exposures, I shot 64-frame bursts." He said the processed final images still looked fine. Fingas, assessing the experiments, concluded that "Google's Nexus 6P and Pixel could take well-exposed, colour-accurate and largely noise-free photos in extremely dark situations. Kainz even managed a decent photo of the night sky using nothing but starlight. The approach can compensate for motion, too, so you might not need a tripod to stabilize your phone."   TOP LATEST PHOTO GALLERIES In Pics: Amitabh Bachchan, Praful Patel, Gulzar, Dia Mirza among those who attended Vinod Khanna's funeral The end of an era: After Hrs looks at some memorable images of the iconic Vinod Khanna...

By: Bloomberg | San Francisco | Updated: May 1, 2017 2:34 pm Most of Amazon’s first-quarter revenue gains came from grabbing retail market share as more people shop online, rather than in stores. (Source: Bloomberg) Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. posted results last week that extended their dominance of how we shop and search online. Apple Inc. and Facebook Inc. will in the coming days add evidence that tech behemoths command an ever widening share of consumer time and spending. Amazon’s revenue soared as shoppers favored it over brick-and-mortar stores, while Google parent Alphabet reported surging quarterly profit that highlighted the ubiquity of its search advertising business — especially on smartphones. “Each has built unique moats that allow them to continue to dominate,” said Ben Schachter, an analyst at Macquarie. “For Google, no one can catch them on search because of the technology and intellectual property. For Amazon, scale is their friend and no one can compete on selection, price and fulfillment capabilities.” The companies have vast networks of complementary products that feed off one another to generate more sales, making it ever harder for competitors to keep up.”Given the strength of Google and Amazon, we think Facebook is likely to look similar,” Schachter said. Also Read:  Amazon takes on Apple and Google as Digital Gatekeeper: Gadfly On Wednesday, Facebook is expected to report first-quarter profit of $2.57 billion, up 70 percent from a year earlier, while revenue climbs 45 percent to $7.82 billion, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. When Apple reports fiscal second-quarter earnings on Tuesday, sales are expected to climb 5 percent to $53 billion. Revenue from the App Store and other services such as Apple Music will likely jump 20 percent to $7.2 billion, according to UBS analyst Steven Milunovich. “The general theme that the big are getting bigger” applies to Apple’s self-feeding ecosystem, Schachter said. Every time Apple sells an iPhone, the customer buys apps and other services, feeding data such as photos and contacts into the device, making it harder to swap for a competitor’s device. Higher margin service revenue then feeds back into Apple’s development budget, helping it build more advanced products to sell to the same consumer. Google’s advertising business is very different, but has similar self-feeding qualities. The company got 97 percent of mobile paid search clicks in the US in the first quarter of 2017, according to client data from digital marketing firm Merkle Inc. That was up from 82 percent in the same period in 2014. With more searches, Google gets more ad dollars to reinvest to keep its search engine ahead of the competition — mostly represented by Microsoft Corp.’s Bing. Google also gets more data on what results people click on, which can be used to improve its software even more, and keep people coming back to find information. Every time Apple sells an iPhone, the customer buys apps and other services, feeding data such as photos and contacts into the device, making it harder to swap for a competitor’s device. (Image for representation Source: AP) “There are clear benefits to that scale,” Mark Ballard, senior director of research at Merkle, said. “There’s that feedback loop.” For advertisers, Google’s large online audience makes it one of the first places to go to run online marketing campaigns. The other is Facebook. Merkle client spending on Facebook ads was up 71 percent in the first quarter, from a year earlier. These advertisers get about 70 percent of their online traffic from Facebook and that hasn’t changed in recent years despite the rise of competitors like Snap Inc., Ballard noted. Facebook and Google captured 77 percent of US digital ad spending last year, up from 72 percent in 2015, according to a recent analysis of data from the Interactive Advertising Bureau by Pivotal Research Group. For advertisers it’s “easier to concentrate budgets with a smaller number of players. It’s easier to manage,” said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal. Marketers have long griped about the “duopoly” atop digital advertising. But they keep giving Google and Facebook money. That’s largely because few other places offer wide reach, channels for targeting consumers and better returns. Those advantages only multiply as the tech companies expand. Verizon Communications Inc.’s new Oath ad business “may figure out a special sauce, but they will never be the first port of call,” Wieser said. When Google and Facebook get those calls first, they see what advertisers plan to spend elsewhere and can sell them other services and tools, according to the analyst.

The largest online retailer isn’t a leading digital advertising destination yet, but on its earnings call last week, Chief Financial Officer Brian Oslavsky reported “consistent growth” from that business. Research firm EMarketer expects the company to generate more display ad revenue than Twitter Inc. by next year. Even so, most of Amazon’s first-quarter revenue gains came from grabbing retail market share as more people shop online, rather than in stores. That shift is fueling a record pace of retailer bankruptcies this year, despite a growing US economy and solid consumer spending. What began with bookstores, movie rental outlets and electronics retailers like Borders, Blockbuster and Circuit City, is spreading to apparel and sporting goods chains like Aeropostale Inc. and Sports Authority Holdings Inc. Google has introduced the Pixel smartphone to help secure its direct relationship with consumers. (Image for representation Source: Reuters) Once online spending in a category passes 20 percent, it’s tough for brick-and-mortar retailers to survive and easy for Amazon to gobble up market share, said Guru Hariharan, chief executive officer of Boomerang Commerce Inc., which designs software for large retailers. Amazon has been disciplined about only pursuing retail categories that are already shifting online, giving it momentum against competitors playing defense, he said, adding that more apparel bankruptcies will come in the next two years. Like Google, which has introduced the Pixel smartphone to help secure its direct relationship with consumers, Amazon has introduced the Echo smart speaker to encourage customers to buy services and products from its website. The software makers are expanding into hardware to feed their money machines. For all the latest Tech News, download Indian Express App now Tags: Amazon Apple Facebook Google No Comments.

Robert Hutton The report comes days after the UK government protested a decision by Twitter to stop letting security officials track terrorist-related posts. Photo: Reuters London: UK home secretary Amber Rudd warned Facebook Inc,. Alphabet Inc.’s Google, and Twitter Inc. to improve monitoring of extremist and hate content after a panel of lawmakers urged her to consider making the hosting of such material a crime. A report from Parliament’s cross-party Home Affairs Committee, to be published Monday, said the companies are “shamefully far” from having done enough to deal with illegal and dangerous content and was scornful of claims that there is little more they can do. It is “shocking” that Google’s YouTube subsidiary allows paid advertising to appear alongside videos created by terrorist groups, the panel said. The report comes days after the UK government protested a decision by Twitter to stop letting security officials track terrorist-related posts. While Rudd stopped short of agreeing with the committee’s recommendation to look at legislation, lawmakers are becoming more confrontational with Internet giants. “We have made it very clear that we will not tolerate the internet being used as a place for terrorists to promote their vile views, or use social media platforms to weaponize the most vulnerable people in our communities,” Rudd said in an emailed statement. “We will continue to push the internet companies to make sure they deliver on their commitments.” Referendum murder The committee’s inquiry was sparked by the murder of House of Commons lawmaker Jo Cox during the referendum campaign last year on leaving the European Union. It examined online material and considered whether it might be encouraging hate crime. Among its conclusions were that YouTube is “awash” with racist material. It said the company refused to remove a video by David Duke, a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, titled “Jews admit organizing White Genocide,” saying it “did not cross the line into hate speech.” Twitter hosted “significant numbers of racist and dehumanizing tweets that were plainly intended to stir up hatred,” the panel said. The company removed many of them after the lawmakers complained, but it refused to delete a cartoon showing “ethnic minority migrants tying up and abusing a semi-naked white woman, while stabbing her baby to death,” because it didn’t breach its “hateful conduct policy,” the report said. Facebook had community pages “devoted to stirring up hatred, particularly against Jews and Muslims,” the panel found. The company removed some posts that the committee highlighted, but said the community pages weren’t violations. Policing costs The report criticizes the companies for relying on others to report offensive material, “outsourcing the vast bulk of their safeguarding responsibilities at zero expense.” It noted that soccer teams are required to pay the costs of policing matches, and urged the government to consult on whether internet companies should have to pay the cost of policing their sites. “The major social media companies are big enough, rich enough and clever enough to sort this problem out -- as they have proved they can do in relation to advertising or copyright,” the report concluded. “It is shameful that they have failed to use the same ingenuity to protect public safety and abide by the law as they have to protect their own income.” Facebook said it has “quick and easy” ways for users to report content and “nothing is more important” to the company than people’s safety. “We agree with the committee that there is more we can do to disrupt people wanting to spread hate and extremism online,” Simon Milner, Facebook’s director of policy, said in an email. “We are working closely with partners, including experts at Kings College, London, and at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, to help us improve the effectiveness of our approach.” Alphabet and Twitter didn’t immediately respond to emails outside of normal business hours requesting comment on the report.

More exactly, the complaint accuses the two tech giants of fraud, improper handling of customer complaints and warranty breach. This comes after various Nexus 6P devices shut down suddenly. What’s more, they even became trapped in the so-called “boot loop” cycles. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas was the one to file the suit, and according to their claims, neither Google, nor Huawei have admitted in a public manner that there were indeed issues with the Nexus 6P model. Even more so, they actually went on with selling the phone, despite everything that was happening. Details about the Model In case you didn’t know about it, the Nexus 6P phone was released towards the end of 2015. It costs $500 and it provides a 5.7 inches screen that is considered an improvement in comparison to the previous Nexus 6 device. All in all, many people seem to be satisfied with it, except for those who see their phone shutting down despite having a full battery. More about the Lawsuit The plaintiff of the lawsuit wishes to force both Google and Huawei to initiate a repairing or recalling program. Besides this, they want the two companies to offer a cash compensation for whoever was affected by the issue. The file also includes a couple of pages of comments from Reddit and also tweets that were published by unhappy Nexus 6P users. From what it seems, the issue started back in September 2016. After the problem with the bootlooping occurs, the suit says that you cannot actually use it anymore. You cannot send messages, access the internet or make calls. Needless to say, this has been extremely unsettling for the users. Related Tagged as: Nexus 6P Google Recommended stories you may like: Nexus 5x vs. Nexus 6P vs. Google Pixel – Which One is Worth It?

One of Google’s founding principles. Image credits Tangi Bertin / Flickr. The measure of the sheer success Google has achieved is that they’re no longer just the guys who do your searching for you — it has become the de facto verb for it. While that isn’t likely to change anytime soon, the company is switching its focus away from search engines to put A.I. development on the forefront. “We continue to set the pace in machine learning and A.I. research,” said Google CEO Sundar Pichai said in a call [embedded at the end of the article] to investors on Thursday to report the company’s Q1 2017 earnings. “We’re transitioning to an A.I.-first company.” So what does this mean for Google, and what does it mean for you? Well, in short, Google wants to become the first totally personalized corporation, tailoring their service to each individual. We’ll probably see machine learning embedded at the core of most of Google’s systems and platforms — such as Google’s Assistant service being merged with Android and Chrome OSs. The goal will be to use machine learning to tailor the devices to each user, timing apps and notifications after their usual schedule or location, personal interests, or other characteristics such as typing habits. Last year, Pichai said that the ultimate goal of Assistant is that if you ask for a pizza, it will bring you that pizza without any further input or oversight required. The company also has to figure out how to keep increasing the number and sophistication of its machine learning algorithms without increasing energy or mobile data use — which would cripple current devices. ADVERTISEMENT Pichai said they would increasingly rely on Google’s recently unveiled “federated learning” technology. It should allow A.I. to run more efficiently on the limited resources a mobile device can marshal, for example, allowing for a wider range of applications while saving up on battery and bandwidth. What about Search Although Google is looking to focus on A.I., search currently remains its single most profitable platform. But even though they’re shifting focus away from search, Google thinks A.I. would only make its results more relevant and its ads more profitable. It would let them find patterns of search and favorite results more easily, and eventually even predict them. It would let Google not only give you what you ask for but predict what you’ll ask for, even change what you want — if that’s a good thing or not, I guess it’s a question we all have to answer for ourselves. Still, this answers why Google is moving away from search as its main focus — there’s a lot of profit to be made with machine learning, especially through analysis of search behavior. Everything done online with even a minute involvement of a Google platform will become quantifiable, and monetizable. Until now, they’ve relied on a sort of passive data acquisition with you coming to them, via search, and feeding the data yourself. A.I. will take up the busywork of actively gathering the data. And the sort of things they can do with this data is amazing. Think about driving home and being prompted with what parking spaces are open near your house in Google Maps. Food shops that cater your absolute favorite kinds of foods in whatever town you happen to be in, or all over the globe on Earth. But with so much data on their hands, the risk of Google derailing from their founding principle of “Don’t be evil” becomes a lot harder to maintain — and a lot scarier if broken.

Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. posted results last week that extended their dominance of how we shop and search online. Apple Inc. and Facebook Inc. will in the coming days add evidence that tech behemoths command an ever widening share of consumer time and spending. Amazon’s revenue soared as shoppers favored it over brick-and-mortar stores, while Google parent Alphabet reported surging quarterly profit that highlighted the ubiquity of its search advertising business -- especially on smartphones. "Each has built unique moats that allow them to continue to dominate,” said Ben Schachter, an analyst at Macquarie. “For Google, no one can catch them on search because of the technology and intellectual property. For Amazon, scale is their friend and no one can compete on selection, price and fulfillment capabilities.” The companies have vast networks of complementary products that feed off one another to generate more sales, making it ever harder for competitors to keep up. "Given the strength of Google and Amazon, we think Facebook is likely to look similar," Schachter said. On Wednesday, Facebook is expected to report first-quarter profit of $2.57 billion, up 70 percent from a year earlier, while revenue climbs 45 percent to $7.82 billion, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. When Apple reports fiscal second-quarter earnings on Tuesday, sales are expected to climb 5 percent to $53 billion. Revenue from the App Store and other services such as Apple Music will likely jump 20 percent to $7.2 billion, according to UBS analyst Steven Milunovich. "The general theme that the big are getting bigger" applies to Apple’s self-feeding ecosystem, Schachter said. Every time Apple sells an iPhone, the customer buys apps and other services, feeding data such as photos and contacts into the device, making it harder to swap for a competitor’s device. Higher margin service revenue then feeds back into Apple’s development budget, helping it build more advanced products to sell to the same consumer. Google’s advertising business is very different, but has similar self-feeding qualities. The company got 97 percent of mobile paid search clicks in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2017, according to client data from digital marketing firm Merkle Inc. That was up from 82 percent in the same period in 2014. With more searches, Google gets more ad dollars to reinvest to keep its search engine ahead of the competition -- mostly represented by Microsoft Corp.’s Bing. Google also gets more data on what results people click on, which can be used to improve its software even more, and keep people coming back to find information. "There are clear benefits to that scale," Mark Ballard, senior director of research at Merkle, said. "There’s that feedback loop." For advertisers, Google’s large online audience makes it one of the first places to go to run online marketing campaigns. The other is Facebook. Merkle client spending on Facebook ads was up 71 percent in the first quarter, from a year earlier. These advertisers get about 70 percent of their online traffic from Facebook and that hasn’t changed in recent years despite the rise of competitors like Snap Inc., Ballard noted. Facebook and Google captured 77 percent of U.S. digital ad spending last year, up from 72 percent in 2015, according to a recent analysis of data from the Interactive Advertising Bureau by Pivotal Research Group. For advertisers it’s “easier to concentrate budgets with a smaller number of players. It’s easier to manage,” said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal. Marketers have long griped about the "duopoly" atop digital advertising. But they keep giving Google and Facebook money. That’s largely because few other places offer wide reach, channels for targeting consumers and better returns. Those advantages only multiply as the tech companies expand. Verizon Communications Inc.’s new Oath ad business "may figure out a special sauce, but they will never be the first port of call," Wieser said. When Google and Facebook get those calls first, they see what advertisers plan to spend elsewhere and can sell them other services and tools, according to the analyst. Advertisers disagree about what company could offer a viable third alternative. Some suggest another internet titan: Amazon. The largest online retailer isn’t a leading digital advertising destination yet, but on its earnings call last week, Chief Financial Officer Brian Oslavsky reported "consistent growth" from that business. Research firm EMarketer expects the company to generate more display ad revenue than Twitter Inc. by next year. Even so, most of Amazon’s first-quarter revenue gains came from grabbing retail market share as more people shop online, rather than in stores. That shift is fueling a record pace of retailer bankruptcies this year, despite a growing U.S. economy and solid consumer spending. What began with bookstores, movie rental outlets and electronics retailers like Borders, Blockbuster and Circuit City, is spreading to apparel and sporting goods chains like Aeropostale Inc. and Sports Authority Holdings Inc. Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up Once online spending in a category passes 20 percent, it’s tough for brick-and-mortar retailers to survive and easy for Amazon to gobble up market share, said Guru Hariharan, chief executive officer of Boomerang Commerce Inc., which designs software for large retailers. Amazon has been disciplined about only pursuing retail categories that are already shifting online, giving it momentum against competitors playing defense, he said, adding that more apparel bankruptcies will come in the next two years. Like Google, which has introduced the Pixel smartphone to help secure its direct relationship with consumers, Amazon has introduced the Echo smart speaker to encourage customers to buy services and products from its website. The software makers are expanding into hardware to feed their money machines. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Brought to you in partnership with MongoDB. Do you have an unreasonable fear of cronjobs? Find spinning up VMs to be a colossal waste of your towering intellect? Does the thought of checking a folder regularly for updates fill you with an apoplectic rage? If so, you should probably get some help. Maybe find another line of work. In the meantime, here’s one way to ease your regular file processing anxieties. With just one application of Google Cloud Functions, eased gently up your Dataflow Pipeline, you can find lasting relief from troublesome cronjobs. But first, some assumptions. Assumptions? You’ve got gcloud installed, you’ve created a project, and you’ve enabled the dataflow and cloud functions APIs. If you haven’t, then a few minutes of reading the Google docs should get you started. I’m Ready Now We are going to set up a Google Cloud Function that will get called every time a cloud storage bucket gets updated. That function will kick off a dataflow pipeline (using the handy new templates) to process the file with whatever complicated data transformations somebody further up the food chain has specified. Hang on, You’ve Lost Me OK, maybe I should have been a bit more explicit in my assumptions. Here’s a quick cheat sheet: Cloud functions: serverless little bits of code (like Amazon’s Lambdas) Dataflow: a managed service for processing large amounts of data Cloud storage: Google’s equivalent of S3 OK, Carry on, We’re Good The first step is to create a few buckets (you can call them whatever you want, but these are the names I’ve used in the rest of this article): One for keeping the code for your cloud function: cloud-fn-staging One for keeping the code for your pipeline: pipeline-staging The bucket you want to monitor for updates: incoming-files If you’re not sure how to create buckets, Google’s docs can help. Or just start clicking around randomly in the cloud console. You’ll work it out. I believe in you, champ. Now What? Now we’re going to make a Dataflow Template. If you’ve already got a pipeline, you can use that one, but I mangled one of the example pipelines that Google gives you. There’s a little fiddly detail here: Templates were introduced in version 1.9.0 of the Dataflow Java libraries, so you’ll need at least that version. However, if you go for the latest 2.x version (which is also the default version that the maven archetypes generate), the way to create your template changes. But the Google docs haven’t been updated for that version. To create the example pipeline, I ran the following maven command: mvn archetype:generate \
    -DarchetypeArtifactId=google-cloud-dataflow-java-archetypes-examples \
    -DarchetypeGroupId=com.google.cloud.dataflow \
    -DarchetypeVersion=1.9.0 \
    -DgroupId=com.shinesolutions \
    -DartifactId=dataflow-template-poc \
    -Dversion="0.1" \
    -DinteractiveMode=false \
    -Dpackage=com.shinesolutions
 Notice the -DarchetypeVersion=1.9.0 option, which ensures that I’m using that version of the libs. Without that option, you’ll end up with the 2.x versions (which I will explain how to use as well, don’t worry). This generates some sample code, including the Dataflow standard WordCount. I edited this to make it templatable. I also invented the word templatable, just now. You can use it, though, it’s cool. Here’s the important changes, first in the WordCountOptions interface (in the WordCount class): public interface WordCountOptions extends PipelineOptions {
    @Description("Path of the file to read from")
    @Validation.Required
    ValueProvider < String > getInputFile();
    void setInputFile(ValueProvider < String > value);

    @Description("Path of the file to write to")
    @Validation.Required
    ValueProvider < String > getOutputFile();
    void setOutputFile(ValueProvider < String > value);
} Instead of the options just being String values, they are now ValueProvider types. This lets the Runner know that these values will be provided later. The main method looks like this: public static void main(String[] args) {
    WordCountOptions options = PipelineOptionsFactory.fromArgs(args).withValidation()
        .as(WordCountOptions.class);
    Pipeline p = Pipeline.create(options);

    p.apply(TextIO.Read.named("ReadLines").from(options.getInputFile()).withoutValidation())
        .apply(new CountWords())
        .apply(ParDo.of(new FormatAsTextFn()))
        .apply(TextIO.Write.named("WriteCounts").to(options.getOutputFile()).withoutValidation());

    p.run();
} The important thing to note here is the .withoutValidation() modifier to the TextIO.Read. If you don’t do that, your template won’t get created because TextIO will try to validate the option values before they’ve been supplied. We’re going to use TextIO in this example, but PubSub and BigQuery input/output in dataflow also support passing in options from templates. To create our template, run this command: mvn compile exec:java \
    -Dexec.mainClass=com.shinesolutions.WordCount \
    -Dexec.args="--project=<your project> \
    --stagingLocation=gs://pipeline-staging \
    --dataflowJobFile=gs://pipeline-staging/templates/WordCount \
    --runner=TemplatingDataflowPipelineRunner"
 If that succeeded, your template has been created. Remember the value you supplied for the dataflowJobFile option, you’ll need that in your cloud function. If you chose to use the 2.x version of the libraries, you probably got an error. I did tell you not to, but you knew better, didn’t you? The command for 2.x looks like this: mvn compile exec:java \
    -Dexec.mainClass=com.shinesolutions.WordCount \
    -Dexec.args="--project=<your project> \
    --stagingLocation=gs://pipeline-staging \
    --templateLocation=gs://pipeline-staging/templates/WordCount \
    --runner=DataflowRunner"
 I haven’t tested this with version 2.x, so don’t blame me if that command deletes the Internet or something. Template's Done. What Next? Now you need your cloud function. They are written in JavaScript running on Node.js, so you should probably install that. Then, in a suitable directory, run npm init to set up a package.json file, which will tell Google what your dependencies are. It will ask you a lot of questions, but don’t stress about the answers, they’re not a big deal. Our cloud function is going to talk to the Dataflow API, so you’ll need to install that dependency. Run npm install --save googleapis to get that done. (Confusingly there are two versions of Node.js support from Google, the @google-cloud packages don’t support Dataflow yet though). The cloud function looks like this: const google = require('googleapis');

exports.goWithTheDataFlow = function(event, callback) {
    const file = event.data;
    if (file.resourceState === 'exists' && file.name) {
        google.auth.getApplicationDefault(function(err, authClient, projectId) {
            if (err) {
                throw err;
            }

            if (authClient.createScopedRequired && authClient.createScopedRequired()) {
                authClient = authClient.createScoped([
                    'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform',
                    'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email'
                ]);
            }

            const dataflow = google.dataflow({
                version: 'v1b3',
                auth: authClient
            });

            dataflow.projects.templates.create({
                projectId: projectId,
                resource: {
                    parameters: {
                        inputFile: `gs://${file.bucket}/${file.name}`,
                        outputFile: `gs://${file.bucket}/${file.name}-wordcount`
                    },
                    jobName: 'cloud-fn-dataflow-test',
                    gcsPath: 'gs://pipeline-staging/templates/WordCount'
                }
            }, function(err, response) {
                if (err) {
                    console.error("problem running dataflow template, error was: ", err);
                }
                console.log("Dataflow template response: ", response);
                callback();
            });

        });
    }
}; We’re going to trigger our cloud function from files being uploaded to a GCS bucket, so goWithTheDataFlow gets called with an event that has a few useful properties. The main one is event.data, which contains the information about the updated resource. We check if the resource exists (because we also get notifications of deletes from the bucket). Then we authenticate – because we’re a cloud function, default application auth is all set up for you – and create a Dataflow API client. Make the call to our dataflow template and we are done. Easy. Now we upload our function to Google’s cloud with a command that looks like this: gcloud beta functions deploy goWithTheDataFlow \
    --stage-bucket cloud-fn-staging \
    --trigger-bucket incoming-files
 If that all went OK, we should be good to test with a file. Awesome. How Do I Know It’s Working? The cloud function logs go to Stackdriver Logging in your Google Cloud console. Upload a file to the bucket, and in a few seconds, you should be able to see some output there. Any errors will appear here, and also trigger an email to you as well (by default anyway). You can see your Dataflow pipeline in the usual Dataflow area of the cloud console, and you can see the output files (if you used the WordCount code from above) in the same bucket as your source file. Great. What Should I Do Now? You’ll probably want to get rid of that test cloud function at some point. Do that with a command like this: gcloud beta functions delete goWithTheDataFlow
 Then make a cup of tea. Put your feet up, close your eyes, let your mind relax and just think about all those cronjobs you can delete. Imagine grinding them under your heel, and setting fire to the VMs they run on. Better now? Good.

Weekend poll: Inbox or Gmail? David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/04/16 1:01pm PDTApr 16, 2017 72 Plus 1 on G+ 136 Share on Facebook 49 Share on Twitter Total Shares257 Applications Polls Google Inbox and Gmail have been competing for our hearts (and email) for some time now, and it doesn't seem like Google is slowing down development of either [great] app. Clearly, Gmail is for some, and Inbox for others - so which one are you? I'm personally keeping one foot in both doors right now. I use Inbox for 100% of my personal email on both mobile and desktop, and I have zero inclination to go back. I also use Inbox for work email here at Android Police when I'm on the go. But on the desktop, AP email goes through a fairly fastidiously managed tabbed Gmail layout, something I'm not sure I could function without. Inbox on the desktop with my AP email address would be a nightmare to sort through and manage, given I receive anywhere from 100 to 300 emails in a single day. So, how about you? Inbox? Gmail? Both? Neither? Vote in the poll and talk it out in the comments below. Inbox or Gmail? Gmail Inbox Both Neither View Results  Loading ... Tags Gmail inbox poll sidebar-poll weekend poll subscribe ...

Andrew Palmer GSuite account, so Gmail is my only option. David Ruddock Inbox works fine for Gsuite, it just has to be enabled by your admin. Andrew Palmer All typical Google services are set to 'On for everyone'. That said i just reinstalled the Inbox app, which I haven't tried to use since it lost its invite only status way back when, and indeed it works. Thanks. Wang Jun Lem Both. Inbox is extremely neat and is easy to handle especially on mobile, but filters are out, and the search function is horrible at determining what's relevant. I keep a tab open for each. Markus Birth I love the auto-detection of flights, restaurant bookings and other events of Inbox (Especially because I add those that are not detected automatically or where there's no mail via this tool I built so they also show up on Google Now.) and the auto-sorting into different folders. But I feel it's (web and app) getting slower and slower with every update. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson Same here, I love the auto detection of flights, hotels and other event Geoff Johnson Gmail does this as well. Markus Birth The last time I checked, GMail didn't detect all the types Inbox did. Also GMail doesn't combine everything into "Trips", does it? StankyChikin Inbox allow you to mark read and archive yet? Raymond Hawkins It's always allowed you to archive. That's what "done" does. I don't think you can mark as read though. roberto.elena I'm pretty sure read/unread is considered a legacy feature by the Inbox team. Roderick Gadellaa Both. Because I need signatures for aliases i use for work (I basically never use my @gmail address) and Inbox still doesn't do that. On mobile I'm pretty much inbox-only though. roberto.elena That was my problem, too, but it's solved now. Well, it's not 100% automatic like in Gmail, but you can save each signature as a template and then insert them manually when you need them. I like this method better as I don't always need to include my signature in my work emails. What is weird is that templates will show as a draft emails in Gmail, but not in Inbox. https://support.google.com/inbox/answer/7107959?hl=en Dystopia USA gmail on my laptop/desktop. inbox on my android. aaron cooper I don't even remember what Gmail looks like.... Eric Karnes Inbox on mobile, Gmail on the desktop. darkvadur same demarcmj This. I don't use any of the fancy "features" of Inbox... I just like it because the interface is nicer. But for some reason on the desktop Inbox is slower than molasses. Like dial-up speed on a decades-old computer slow. So I use gmail on desktop. SpasilliumNexus On phone, Inbox for my main account, Gmail for others. Gmail for everything on desktop. Daniel Gherard I personally prefer Inbox. But, it's not like Gmail is bad. It's just a preference. For me, Inbox looks way better than Gmail and structures my emails in a neat way. sgtguthrie Unfortunately, I miss important emails with inbox, so I use Gmail. If it's not broke... M Gordon That's what happened to me Everytime I tried inbox so I only use Gmail. Has it been fixed yet? sgtguthrie It wasn't the last time I tried it, about 6 months ago. Dennis Bareis What needs fixing? It can be a bit confusing at times, you probably set up a bundle that shows up later. M Gordon No I didn't set anything, what I mean is I would only get notified about emails a couple hours after Gmail notified me. This happened with all my emails. darkvadur there is a problem with your phone OS, have you enabled a custom save battery feature or something? what ROM are you using Inbox is better than gmail to me MicroNix You summed it up yourself. It's a confusing app. It's also lags gmail in notifications. It just feels like one of those half baked Google apps. Kyle J Inbox is not supposed to send you notifications unless they are important. I got so many Gmail notifications I did not need. I use Inbox just for personal use though. I'm not sure how I would feel about using it for work since I have never used it that way. Dollar Flipper I have no idea what this means. New emails come in just like any other email app... catalysto Turn off the bundling. Notifications can be set for each bundle, so some emails are probably being added to bundles that have notifications turned off. Kevin Sword Adding on to this, add all bundles to the inbox. Check your spam folder 📂 frequently. Otherwise you might miss important mail ✉ that the AI thinks is unimportant. theProffer Same. I followed the repliers' suggestions as well, and I still have issues with Inbox's push notifications. It almost gives me the impression that it's polling and not pushing (I know it's not, but it's laggy as if that). If I could get these email notifications immediately, I'd probably switch, but I also love some of the more granular controls Gmail has (which maybe Inbox has duplicated over time, I haven't tried it in about 6'ish months). -Matoro Zeliph- Gmail...because I got used to the clunky nature from dealing with all the time from work. Alex Inbox snoozing/pinning is too good to not use most of the time. Occasionally I have to go to GMail for something. But 90% of the time it's Inbox. StarLightPL Gmail has hangout history and is sometimes more clear presenting new mails. Inbox has neater hangout integration but no history search (why?). I switch between both. Raymond Hawkins The only time I open Gmail instead of inbox anymore is to search chat history. Because for some dumb reason you can't do that from inbox. David Ruddock because RIP hangouts Tom Westrick Google would like to offer some Allo for that burn Brendabcox Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job. Even everyone not used to this, can make $89/per h easily and the earnings can go even higher over time...

Brian Nice Word Play Pascal Welsch Creating filters is another reason why I have to open Gmail Raymond Hawkins I was forgetting that one. I do occasionally open Gmail for filters also. Roy Yeah, I like Inbox, but Google has such a bad habit of replacing working apps/sites/etc with "better" replacements that don't have feature parity. catalysto It makes sense that you can't do it from Inbox because the search function should be built directly into Hangouts. But for some dumb reason, Google, the king of search, never added that. /shruggie 😆😄 +1 for /shruggie The Tech Temple ¯_(ツ)_/¯ OhYeah! I think Google has also totally failed at search in the play store. I almost never get the app I want even in the first page of results when searching for the exact name. shonangreg They had been failing with youtube as well. Search for something, find something similar, and then browse the suggested related videos? Trash! I was repeatedly watching videos that were being voted thumbs down 10:1. Why? It made me give up on trying to browse youtube for anything. All those videos there, and I just stopped. Recently it seems to be better. Not sure why. Martins Nkem Still using GMail until Google makes Inbox actually work catalysto Inbox works great. Martins Nkem It sucks at handling attachments catalysto I never run into that problem. Martins Nkem Where does it store the attachments you've viewed? Kevin Sword It doesn't? You have to manually download them. catalysto They remain in Inbox. Where else would they go? Martins Nkem What i meant was this.. In Gmail, attachments are usually saved in the downloads folder in local storage, where does Inbox save its own files catalysto They can be kept in Inbox, saved to Drive, or downloaded locally. Not sure what else you'd need. Martins Nkem Which folder is it downloaded to locally? catalysto Whichever one you want! You've never used the Save As dialog?! Martins Nkem On mobile? catalysto Ohhhhh, on mobile. Forgive me; I was thinking desktop. But yeah, on mobile, attachments go to the Downloads folder like other apps. Martins Nkem Not in my case, it redownloads the files every time catalysto Redownloads? As in downloads every time you tell it to download? That's normal. Timothy Vreeland No it doesn't. It has syncing issues with many devices. darkvadur fix your phone and it will work it's not google fault if your phone have problems. catalysto Never had that problem, and I use it on all my devices. Mbdo Inbox because of auto-categorized e-mails and no sponsored e-mails (like Gmail) Furthermore the web version of Gmail is really old (Google Agenda too) Timothy Vreeland What is a sponsored email? Been using Gmail since it was invitation only, and never saw one. Mbdo In Gmail, on the categories (like "social" for example) I have some "ad" emails just like Google AdWords on the Web... It's not the case for Inbox. Check this screenshot : https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ca9d6f5a0599814fa001c5add402543e0ab9e13c245dcd6e5177bb5026c9708b.png Christopher Bement I flip flop every few months. Gmail has some great feature that haven't made it to Inbox yet, like inserting Gifs with Gboard. But the snoozing is sooooooo useful. someone755 The GMail app is a mess on Android. It's big, it's clunky, and it's barely optimized. Inbox looks sleek and conveniently sorts things into categories that a mobile user would appreciate. On the desktop however, Inbox is unusable. You quickly realize that automatically sorting your emails won't get you anywhere, and that the design takes a step back in terms of functionality as compared to Gmail. Tyler Walles Gmail, classic, catergories disabled, because I will sort it myself, and dont judge me when I say my inbox has more then 5000 emails El Presidente I don't really want or need an email app that tries to be anything more than an email app so Gmail works fine for me. I've tried to use Inbox tonnes of times and never used it for more than a day. roberto.elena If you literally never used it more than a day, then you probably never used the snooze feature, which is one of Inbox more important advantages compared to Gmail. El Presidente I suppose it depends on what you want from email. All I want to do with emails is read and respond to them. If I have one that I don't want to respond when I read it, I'll just leave it in my inbox and respond when it suits. Snooze isn't something I'd ever need. Inbox, in my opinion, just over complicates things. roberto.elena I think it mostly depends on what volume of important emails you get. Sure, if you only have one email now and then that you want to reply later, you don't need Inbox, but if you need to have many of those in your Gmail inbox, it gets rapidly crowded. And there are many times, at least in my case that I know exactly when I want to deal with a message, instead of a generic "later". For example, on friday I snooze ALL my unarchived work emails until monday morning. I certainly don't need/want to see those emails during the weekend on my inbox. For the rest I decide on a case by case basis. Fruity101079 It's strange to understand. On friday, just leave your unread emails where there are. There will be there on Monday when you will come back to your office... roberto.elena I manage several email addresses within a single Gmail account, including my work email. Fruity101079 Why mix work and personal emails if you don't want to check them on the weekend? Didn't your employer give you a phone? roberto.elena I don't receive work emails on the weekends, so it's not that I don't want to check new work emails on the weekends, it's that I don't need to see the pending emails in my inbox while I definitely don't need them until monday. And yes, I prefer to mix personal and work emails in the same app (I use filters and labels I already created in Gmail, not just the automatic categories of Inbox, and they work with Inbox just fine too). The work email weekend situation is just one example of why I love snoozing, but there are many interesting uses. You buy something on ebay from Hong Kong and it's expected to arrive in 10-15 days. Well no need to have that in you inbox 10 days, you just snooze it. Somebody tells you they are going to contact you back in 3 days time, Well, 3 days later, that email reappears in your inbox to remind you that, in case they didn't. Etc. If you don't have a too many of those emails cluttering your inbox, then it's understandable you don't see the need for snoozing, but for many of us Inbox is the best that has happened to email since Gmail was launched. The same way that Gmail turned emails into conversations (and of course also offered 1GB instead Hotmail's 15-25 MB), changing email for many of us forever, Inbox has turned emails into tasks, with its done/pinned/snoozed paradigm. Fruity101079 Sure sure, it's a nice thing to have to choice. I understand the kind of use you can make with inbox now you explained it. It's just I'm not concerned. akshay7394 You sure asked a lot of questions considering you aren't concerned 😂 Fruity101079 We are here to discuss :) Geoff Johnson That seems overly complicated. Why not have a work email and a personal email? Why have them both go to the same inbox? That way you can just ignore anything coming to your personal email without it cluttering your personal inbox. roberto.elena Because I still want to check my personal email while I'm at work, my private life doesn't stop simply because I'm at work, and I don't get many work related emails outside of working hours, so they don't bother me in my free time, and even when I do get some, it's so easy and fast to snooze them, so it is much better for me to have everything in one place. In my case it's​ more complicated having two inboxes instead of one. catalysto I feel the opposite. Inbox simplifies things for me because it keeps only the emails I need to pay attention to at any given time and hides the rest. It's done wonders for my workflow. Thisismyusername1982 Thats what the archive button is for. catalysto Archive is not snooze. Archived messages do not reappear at a predetermined time or location. The snooze feature is the magic that makes it so useful for me. Archive does not do this. Fruity101079 If you don't need to pay attention to some emails (spam?), why not just delete them? catalysto Because I often want to come back to them later. For example, an email to pay a bill, but I don't want to do it at work. If I want to snooze that action until I get home, I can do that. And that's the core difference with Inbox: emails aren't just messages; they are to-dos. For someone who likes to use the zero-inbox, GTD flow, it's amazing. But of course, that's personal preference, and I get that lots of people don't use email that way. Geoff Johnson That's exactly what I don't like about it. Then those emails get lost and forgotten about. If it's spam, just delete/block it. Kevin Sword That's what you use the snooze feature for. It'll send you another notification when you actually need to get something done. catalysto But I'm not talking about spam. I'm talking about messages I want to deal with at a later time. I never see spam in my inbox. And the snoozed messages don't get "lost and forgotten". Snoozed emails reappear at a predetermined time or place. Kevin Sword Yeah, I always have a completely clear inbox which is pretty incredible. I can snooze stuff that doesn't need to be dealt with. catalysto Yeah, I love seeing that sun shining background when I'm done with my tasks. =) tekfr33kn Choices... Michael Hazell If I have one that I don't want to respond when I read it, I'll just leave it in my inbox and respond when it suits. I pretty much do that, or just flag the email for follow-up. I guess I'm too much of an Outlook user. m-p{3} I switched to Inbox as soon as I could at work (I'm not the Google Apps Admin). The snooze feature is wonderful, and I can use my emails as a ToDo list as I go. Dollar Flipper The only people I've seen with this issue didn't clean up their inbox at the start. You need to snooze/mark everything in your email as done and then work from there. El Presidente Both my inboxes are pretty "clean" (at the moment, there's one unread mail in each) and I get circa 15-20 emails a day in each. Snoozing an email is as good as leaving it in your inbox, so you can see it every time you access your account works for me. Snoozed mails would just mean I'd keep snoozing them and never respond. I've a pretty good labelling/filter system, inbox just complicates that. I get inbox works for some people, just not for me. HSidhu with Gmail you don't get reminder and 'save it later' (saved) tab, I wish they put that in the gmail. catalysto Snoozed messages notify you when they reappear. It works more as a GTD to-do list than just a simple list of emails. For a lot of people, that works better. m-p{3} Yeah, at some point I figured that I couldn't possibly sort through it all, so I had to make the call to mark everything "done" and keep my mailbox clean from that moment. So far, my goal is to reach that beautiful sun at the end of the day. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/414cadbe40ffe9b274cc1af9f92d36e8753dc782ac466fc16e1de0959c6fb364.png Marvin R. I totally agree. Inbox is only good for the 0 inbox approach people (where every mail is a kind of little task for them) which is for me a goal I don't want to achieve because I want to see as much mails as possible to browse through them. The big fonts/spacing in inbox + making unrelevant mails bigger (like mails of purchases) is not working for me. Tried so often. Never worked out. My chaos system + some filters and *colorful* labels works better than AI assisted ones (for me). roberto.elena You can use the same labels and filters in Inbox, they work exactly like the automatic Inbox bundles. Marvin R. yes I know. But actually I'm loosing how many are unread in the labels and (which is worse for me) I loose the colors of labels :( roberto.elena Well, if the label colors are important to you, then I agree it sucks. I used to have a lot of filters/labels in Gmail, but now using Inbox I found I don't need most of them, so the automatic Inbox categories plus a couple a my own labels work for me. At first I also felt some "read/unread anxiety", when I started using Inbox, but then I realized it wasn't an issue anymore. With Inbox my inbox is as clean as possible, so I can clearly see what's unread and what's read there. If something is not in my inbox, then it means I already decided whether it's "done" or "snoozed", so I don't really care about read/unread. Maybe you have filters that send emails to a label skipping the inbox and that's why you need the unread count, but I think the bundling in Inbox is a good alternative for that. Of course all of this is MY opinion, related to MY needs. Your mileage may vary. It's not the first poll of this kind that i see, and Inbox adoption is clearly improving over time. I don't remember any spectacular changes in Inbox lately, so I think one of the reasons is that people are slowly understanding how to better use Inbox, and that's why I replied to several comments here, to explain things they might not realize. Of course, there will be always people that don't use Inbox despite fully understanding its features. You might be one of them... or not. kajover inbox.. i just switch back to gmail for the settings DKS No poll selection to accurately record my response -- Gmail for personal, Boxer for work. Boxer was part of Cynanogen OS when I had my OPO and I just stuck with it when I set up my Pixel. It works fine for my work needs. Maybe I just don't realize what I'm missing with Inbox, though. Metallinatus Good thing that you work with your boxers on. mcdonsco Gmail, that I don't use much. My main email is exchange and while it technically works in Gmail, it's not robust enough for my needs so I use Nine. Metallinatus Gmail on desktop have been dead for years, this is not 2010 anymore, I use Inbox because of the much more modern interface. But I still need to use Gmail to search for something in those old Hangouts conversations that are kept there, don't know why Inbox couldn't just be able to do that too.... obarthelemy I have several non-gmail email addresses, and I'm trying to keep things standard, so I'm sticking with AOSP mail, which is pure IMAP with no lock-in special features. M6 You can use gmail for non-gmail addresses, and you can use AOSP mail or other IMAP clients with gmail addresses (you can export all your gmail emails as well). There is no lock-in whatsoever... obarthelemy Yes there is. Tags, rules, filters, snooze.... are nonstandard, so if you start to depend on them on them you can no longer move away. Lock-in is not just about the raw data, it's also about the process you build around features. aRvInD I am impressed with mymail's almost instant push notification. So I'm using. If Inbox supports IMAP like Gmail, it'd be awesome..! Miku is Best Vocaloid Inbox is sexier and more useful to me. My1 it's not like you can go childmaking with an app anyway, so why use that as reasoning? lzdking Sexy is a common adjective to describe the aesthetics of inanimate objects (cars, boats, buildings etc...), not sure why you are taking exception to its use. My1 I thought maybe it was obvious, or just forgot the (/s), well Poe's Law strikes again ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Technically you have to have both with Inbox. Love the look of Inbox but don't like how the attachment size is limited on Inbox Michael Sørensen How and why do you get 100 to 300 emails in a single day!? Seriously. I use Outlook with one personal account and 2 work accounts. Every type of auto-categorizing and sorting turned off. Dennis Bareis "Filters" and search in Inbox are hopeless, but it has Snooze and it "decodes" travel and other emails. IUf GMAIL did that I'd go back in a sec. Tom Westrick Gmail, since it does what I need it to. Haven't felt a reason to switch away Wayren Inbox 100% of the time. I had no idea how perfect this product was for me until I started using it for my personal email. Cristian-Teodor TATOIU Samsung Email all the way! iluvthesoftsoft inbox for personal use, gmail for work Fotis Nakos Whenever Inbox offers Labels and Sublabels, I'll consider. Until then, Gmail and yes, I cannot work differently. mickey4mice Inbox for me, but it's impossible to delete a single email from a threaded conversation without making a total mess. If I forward an email to myself, I still go to Gmail to delete the forwarded version without fearing I might delete the original. Andy McDearmon I use Inbox on any Android device, and Gmail on my PC. Nate Inbox all the way but they need to add print functionality to it.. Dollar Flipper Inbox has revolutionized my personal e-mail usage. Turning e-mails into reminders has made such a big difference. If I could get desktop Outlook to work like Inbox, my work email would be even better. Outlook app for the phone added this but it isn't all seamless yet. NooSH Inbox all day. Andrew Last time I tried Inbox, I couldn't add an Exchange account so it's useless to me. I'm not going to go back and forth using multiple email clients. Gmail does it all and it does it well. Harold JP Castro Gmail because when you have filters set up it behaves pretty much like Inbox (except for snoozing) Margaritas Ante Porcos Inbox is like Google+. Few people say they love it but you never meet nobody who uses them in reality. Also, I think some people like to test new things, awaiting for them to become a trend, so they could be that crowd that's always on top. I mean, Inbox is not a phenomenon Gmail once was. It is just a gimmick for few geeks. Bob Allen I guess I don't get enough e-mail to use anything but Gmail.. Work e-mail is a completely different system. That said, Inbox did seem like a good way to organize multiple accounts when I tried it. Erik Inbox most of the time, Gmail for searching and dealing with labels. Branko Paid email hosting + own domain. That's how you actually own your emails. Mike K? Not sure what you're getting at, I doubt most people here care. Kevin Sword Not until you're running your own server you're not! /s but seriously. Henrique Persechini I've realized once I've started using Inbox that all my carefully organized labels never actually helped me in any way except keeping my organization anxiety occupied. Once I was set free, I went with a zero label email and have been loving it ever since Hector Diaz Inbox just missing the option to print to be perfect Colin Rowlands The ideal for me would be Gmail with snooze, that was the main thing I liked about Inbox, but it wasn't enough to keep me using it. Trooper311 Gmail ftw. M. Luciano Inbox all day long. CasperTFG I miss Mailbox. Gone from Blue Mail, Aqua Mail to Newton. Now on MailDroid and MailCal. Anything other than Inbox and Gmail. Rob H. Neither. I use: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.easilydo.mail Gmail app has been terrible. surethom Gmail. All the way just wish you could turn off conversion view it just does not work. Jon Fridman While I enjoy many features of Gmail, Inbox has reminders, and pinned emails. Nothing beats the Inbox experiences for what I need. There are some shortcomings for both on desktop and mobile. Andy I prefer the simplicity of Gmail, I just wish Gmail had the nicer animations and material design of Inbox, and pulled in sender images like Inbox does (like an Amazon email having the Amazon logo instead of a big circle with an A in it). Joseph Hurtsellers I've used Inbox since it came out. I recently switched back to gmail. The reason is I kept having tons of laggy time out issues on my chromebook. (I tried multiple solutions including a power wash). But what I've also noticed attaching files; copying items and pasting ect. is MUCH easier for me on Gmail. Just IMHO. waloody88 Gmail looks professional and is functional for me. Didn't like inbox. It felt like an app designed for childern Jared Gauthier The only time I use Gmail is to search in Trash. You can't do that in Inbox. Once and awhile I'll delete an email thinking I won't need it anymore and then end up needing it. Mike Dawson "Once in a while". Sorry, I'm not usually the grammar police. Jared Gauthier Haha thanks. Edited. I'm usually conscious of that stuff. Mike Dawson I hate myself for posting that! Jared Gauthier I forgive you. axnjackson11 If you want to search in Trash in Inbox, this is what you need to type: in:trash whatever you're looking for. Once you put in:trash at the front, it'll properly show whatever you're looking for just in the Trash. Jared Gauthier I'll try that! Adonis K. Inbox all the way, handling 100s of emails per day without it is simply crazy. Tomáš Petrík I just can't look at my emails as tasks, they are, well, emails. I tried to use Inbox, but I noped out back to Gmail. Karl Mathias Moberg I use both. I use inbox for my personal email on my phone, but on the desktop I use the web gmail app. For my work email I use the Gmail app. Find it easier to sort this way, and since I don't have the same categories for my work email I prefer the basic app. getinet Gmail on desktop. Inbox on mobile. Nick Cannon Only a matter of time before Google Kills inbox HSidhu could be... lol Abraham When inbox came out I tried it and found there was no mark as read option. DOA for me at least. Who knows if they have it now, never bothered to try it again. Willie Chalmers III That's sort of one of Inbox's big selling features. There's certainly a mark as read button along with email snoozing. Leonardo Baez Gmail. Vever tried inbox. I see no sense TechGuy22 Gmail either way Google wins. Tobias A. G. Gmail is just awful. I wish I could uninstall it. BC I much prefer Inbox by Gmail...It's less clunky for me and makes dealing with my emails easier. Inbox tends to sort my emails smartly so I never have to futz with sorting emails, as Inbox does it fairly well. When I do make changes those changes are always respected by Inbox by Gmail. It's much more refreshing than plain Gmail, at least from my perspective. Aaron T Inbox on mobile but Gmail on desktop. Inbox website is way slower and clunky outside of the mobile app. makapav I also use GMail for more powerful search with the drop-down boxes for email. InBox needs to still catch-up with GMail in lots of functionality that I think is fringe but very valuable. dblock Tried to use Inbox once when it first came out, however it seemed to over complicate email. I also don't really use email for much at all outside of work, which I have access to Outlook for while at work. Otherwise all my emails are just promotions and payment receipts/shipping updates. I just stick with Gmail. C64 The stock mail app from Samsung on my S7 edge Vivek Rameses That's surprisingly a really good client. Max Johnson AOSP Email. Adrianus AJ Nadeak Inbox because it makes using email bearable. Scott Harris I use a desktop mail app for my work and personal email, so using Inbox is a waste of time for me Scott Harris On mobile I use gmail since I can access my work email within the gmail app. Paul Quinn Gmail. Mostly because my email habits are so hardwired at this point from using Exchange at work. I haven't gone back and tried Inbox in a while. It does have a learning curve and you have to commit to it for a period of time to give it a fair shake. Iamsecond I'm not particularly a fan of either interface, but Gmail wins for me because I just want to organise my own email how I want it, without an algorithm deciding for me! Justin Osborne If I need to find an email, I use Gmail. Inbox search is TERRIBLE. I use Inbox for everything else though. ekngee Inbox for personal, Gmail for work (because my workplace is still too stubborn to learn new things. some even cannot stop using Outlook even though our emails go thru Gmail servers) Timothy Vreeland Inbox is prettier, so I have tried to use it, but it seems pointless. Lacks features I use, but it's main feature of auto sorting always messes something up and overcomplicates email. 99% of the time, an email is important and I'll open it, or it's spam and I'll mark it as so. No point in having a big messy system to auto manage 1% of my mail. Adrien Baron You can configure everything if you want too, create your own bundles (which are actually just GMail tags under the hood), and choose wether you want them to appear bundled or not, and be notified or not. I almost had nothing to configure for my personal, but did it for my work address (we are using Inbox), and it works great. Deeco Wow, I'm surprised by the poll. Honestly, I find Inbox confusing as hell! whispy_snippet It's like a lot of things in that you just need to get used to it. Once you do it's awesome. Marty If it weren't for the fact you can't have multiple accounts in Inbox, I'd give it a go. But I doubt it would be as good as Outlook since Gmail can't do a defaulted combined inbox. lzdking I'm surprised that I haven't seen more people mention using Outlook. While I don't use it myself (Inbox for me), Outlook is a very impressive Android e-mail client and the desktop interface isn't too shabby either. Marty It amazes me that Microsoft isn't capitalizing on Google's laziness. Not only is Microsoft's email better than anything Google has, but Google Search isn't anything like it used to be 5 to 8 years ago. Microsoft could step in and displace Google Search with their own search engine. Geoff Johnson That's what I don't get, there shouldn't be a need to "get used to it". Email is simple, it comes in you read/reply to it when you have time. If you don't want to now, simply ignore it and come back to it when you do. m-p{3} The thing is that keeping too many email "in sight" makes me unconsciously reread the titles everytime I go check my mailbox. If I can't reply to it right now (because of lack of info, progress) I can snooze it and keep it out of sight and focus on what's important right now. lzdking I don't get the "getting used to it" either. For me, I used inbox and was instantly amazed by how much more useful and organized it was. There was nothing to get, all my e-mails were automatically bundled into the categories I needed. darkvadur seems like your brain can't handle new things, how old are u? darkvadur inbox on my phone mostly because the actions buttons on notifications are more useful than gmails ones Bewear AOSP mail. #MasterRace (?) Marty Neither. I use Outlook. Best there is. Ryan N Yup. I also like Alto. Gmail is awful. Never used Inbox because of no multi email support. Joshua Talley Inbox is nice on mobile, but is horribly slow on the desktop. Gmail is reliable on both. I can effectively ignore huge swaths of mail using inbox very quickly, but I can actually mark them as read/unread in Gmail. It's a toss-up. Vivek Rameses Neither. Both are crap. K9 mail is hands down the best email client. Gordon Spurgeon Spooner Does ProtonMail work with K9? Vivek Rameses Paid accounts. shonangreg Aren't K9 and kaiten both abandonware? After years of no updates, I switched from kaiten to AquaMail on android (and Outlook on my iPad). I used to use Thunderbird on my PC's, but I removed it after it would repeatedly swell to several GB in size even though I was using IMAP with all accounts set to fairly minimal disk usage. Now I don't have an email app on my PC's. I just use my mobile devices for email and open gmail or hotmail in the browser if I feel like it. AquaMail works great: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.kman.AquaMail&hl=en $5 for a professional email app is well worth it. Outlook works pretty well on the iPad, though I still can't get messages to go full screen to enlarge the fonts like it should do . . . HSidhu Inbox for mobile and gmail for desktop. lomsha Doesn't inbox only work with Gmail accounts? CD RW it works with other account if you "Gmailfy" them before https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6304825 lomsha Aaah thank you. usnmustanger Your poll choices are inadequate. What about "Inbox & 3rd Party Client"? I use both Inbox and BlueMail, which has some major advantages over the Gmail app, such as snoozing messages, threaded viewing, etc.). With so many great 3rd party email apps out there, you ought to try to avoid sounding too fanboyish by taking such an "all-google-or-nothing" approach in your polls. Latheryin I don't bother with either. Inbox is just not versatile enough and Gmail is just too slow. Blue mail does. Everything needed and does it Pretty well. Ross I have to use Gmail, when I use Inbox my reminders don't always sync between inbox and the Google app, resulting in missed reminders. I rely on reminders too much. Otherwise I loved Inbox. Rook HD inbox is sleeker but it has a fatal flaw to me. it doesn't display the specific time of the received emails and for some reasons I can't stand that Scros97 You have to open the email you want to see the specific time and then click on the name of the other person. Doing so it displays more details like the date ;) Matt Blackberry Hub, which I guess kind of uses Gmail. Tristian Hill Always Inbox, except when my OCD kicks in and I've gotta "mark all conversations as read" and I'm too lazy to do it one by one on Inbox Scros97 I do the very same usage of Gmail 😂 Sudhir Khanger How does Inbox work with email that are notifications, mailing lists, bills, newsletters, etc.? These are not important and I would like to browse them at a later stage. I don't want to worry about them and I filter them in Gmail and look at them when needed every couple of days. CD RW they are automatically sorted in categories : notifications, travel, , social network ,financial,forums and deals And for each of these categories, you can choose how they appear on your Inbox : as soon as they arrive, once a day, once a week You can also create your own categories just like in gmail with labels HD If I could add my non-gmail address into Inbox, I would've happily voted for Inbox. Brendabcox Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job.

Sherman Does Inbox support Yahoo or Live accounts? No? Even after a FULL YEAR since I last used it? Back to Gmail, then. CD RW Inbox support them if you "Gmailify" them : https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6304825 Eleo Outlook all the way! Gmail app is not as user-friendly as outlook and inbox knows too much about me. I dont like that Jan-Lk Else Phone: Inbox, PC/Web: Gmail. Best combination! Captain_Invisible I'm shocked! I can't believe there are still people using the Gmail app, when the glorious Inbox exists. I could never go back. Marty Lol...most people probably have multiple email accounts. Can't have multiple account in Inbox. 😉 Kristian Ivanov Quite surprising that both options have a 43% score at the time I'm writting this comment O_o For me it's Gmail...I just don't need any of the Inbox features so no point in using it...I do see reasons why others like it though. AQ apps? neither, gmail through k9 mail. Martin B. I never saw poll this close here. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0edf28e3e42c8d0ad2c36a79e66f5cd9b16a678152108035c59111ee155ec76c.jpg Fruity101079 Inbox GUI is better, Gmail looks old, but I don't understand all those things in Inbox. There are tabs/categories (i don't need) everywhere. Some emails are not displayed in the main box. And there is no notifications or visual thing that tell me there is something new in this categories. There are no folders anymore. So all your emails from the creation of your account are all displayed in your main box (!?). A lot of persons are talking of Snooze option, but I don't get its utility (it's the same on my alarm clock, when it rings in the morning, i wake up. Done. Why using a ring to wake you up just enough to push the snooze button that will ring again 1 minute later? It's incomprehensible...). And one more thing: not talking about work (at work we are using the mailbox the society want you to use, if you got them on your personal phone it's a particular case), but seriously, what kind of life do you have to get so many emails each day that you don't have time to answer? How important could they be that you need to snooze them? If there are so important just reply! If there are so important, you won't forget! And it's not like emails are going to disappear as soon as you read them. They still will be there, in your mail box. There is no trap. ninjustin I snooze things all the time that come in during the work day I need to handle when I get home or on the weekends. It's also handy in keeping track of when I need to pay my bills. Fruity101079 Clearly, we don't use it the same way. I never have to pay bills through an email. And i get 1 or 2 emails maximum per day. And there are not important. I don't need to snooze anything, i remember what i got. Nicholas Nezis If only Inbox supported a proper signature block, then I would switch over to Inbox 100%. Steve Crane The only time I open Inbox is when I want to clear my Gmail inbox by deferring (snoozing) mails I want to read in the evening or on the weekend. If snoozing was built into Gmail I would have no need for Inbox at all. Kostas 💪🎩 If inbox had a "mark as read and archive" function instead of just archive, I would change in a heartbeat ShahinTr Never got used to Inbox, especially that chat-esque conversation. Gave it so many chances, but I prefer the conventional email application. Also, Gmail has taken a few features from Inbox that have integrated well with it. BanksKillian tie Michel Sa Inbox is my to-do list, and that's all what i need from an email app. CD RW inbox can't leave inbox due to snooze by location (genious idea) and by time Fresh360 Inbox is a great app I love it, I don't know how I functioned on mobile without it but goodness gracious is it disastrous on the desktop so wide, so bright, so cumbersome. So I strictly use Gmail on the desktop, it's weird but the two email program route works the best. Justin Martin Why don't they just put the hangout's functionality in Gmail so you can set it up either way. Again Google putting out multiple apps just like the whole messaging thing. sloheim I've grown to appreciate Inbox (other than the painful slowness of the web version, it is BRUTAL). I just wish it worked with non-gmail accounts. If I could hook up my Office365 account, it would be ideal. CD RW you can you just need to gmailify your account : https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6304825?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&hl=en then inbox will support this account Georg Eitler AOSP Mail. PC_Peasant’s number 1 fan Neither Chad Knasinski Gmail on the web because it is much faster than Inbox. Inbox for the app for the same reason. Rob Paek Wow, dead even at 43% for Gmail and Inbox! RomiresT Inbox desktop version is killing me. It hangs, lags and dissapoint me in last few month. So, I just switch back to Gmail. kjohnson04 Never could get into using Inbox. Count me in the Gmail camp. Suyash Bansal Inbox on PC and Gmail on phone. grebulon Hop email messanger (https://gethop.com/) is what inbox is unsuccessfully trying to do. SHunter I need Inbox to support Send Money / Request Money just like Gmail does.... kalehv I only use Gmail to reply/forward a specific message in the conversation (thread) Inbox doesn't do that. For Inbox, it's all or none. Garett You can do that now in Inbox :) kalehv haha, apparently yes, that works. Scott Breitbach Inbox, except when I need to search for something specific. rctx81 My main issue with Inbox is that, for the most part of the time, it doesnt seem to obey my previous Gmail filters and labels. I like its snooze/archive functions, but then I ended up using Spark on my MbPro/iPad, fell in love with it and now I cant wait for its Android version. Nowadays I barely touch Inbox on mobile and I try to process as much email as possible from my Mac and iPad. jamez243 Still can't print from within the inbox app... how has this not been fixed anymore? 1966CAH On the desktop- GMail. On my phone- Inbox. David I use both since I need to use gmail to access my college email account. But besides that, Inbox is life ipsofact Inbox all day ! saf1927 I didn't expect that many people preferring Inbox to Gmail. I remember I've only used it for a couple of months only because Gmail didn't have material design yet. Daniel Rodríguez Ycaza Gmail for laptop/desktop and Inbox for cellphone/tablet works for me! Hurricane Andrew I've been using Inbox since it was invite only. It's changed the way I use email, allowing me to keep a nice clean inbox, quickly triage messages, and avoid the feeling of being overwhelmed by the volume of messages that I get on a daily basis. Jim I've tried Inbox... it's just too much work for me. Gmail works just fine for my needs which is reading regular emails, most of which are sales/marketing and other "subscription" emails. I don't get a lot of personal emails so all that compartmentalizing just got to be way too much to handle. b_boogey_xl After multiple start and fails, I finally realized how to use Inbox and once I discovered that, I haven't looked back. When I use regular email, all I think to myself is how much better the experience would be if I could filter it through Inbox. Ygor Cortes The problem with Inbox is that it only supports Google emails, so Gmail is the way to go for me. Ygor Cortes Inbox's website is miles better than Gmail's though. No competition there. Pedro Diego Fernández I get an email, I read/answer/delete it... done... don't want any "smart" sorting or e-learning algorithm...I don't even use the tabs in gmail that sort email into ads, social media and work... I'll handle my stuff myself... to me the only thing gmails need is an option to schedule an answer, because sometimes I'll sit at night an write the answers and keep them as drafts ti send them in the morning in business hours TheManuz I would use Gmail BUT... Inbox has snooze and that's the only reason I use it. Bruce Wayne What's snooze? keithzg That feature that doesn't work half the time :( CD RW always works 100% of the time for me weird keithzg For me it goes in phases. Unfortunately that means I can never really rely on it. To be clear, snoozing to a time actually always works, but snoozing to a place is infuriatingly broken. TheManuz I don't know if it's the correct name, since I use Inbox in italian. Anyway here's an example: when you receive an email and you think "I don't need it right now, this thing has to be dealt with on friday" and then you click "snooze" and postpone that email on friday, 9:30 AM. The email is gone, and it will come back on friday at the time you chose. Bruce Wayne Ohhh. Nifty feature. CD RW even better you can snooze by location. received a work email when you're at home ? snooze it by location to office. As soon as you arrive at office the mail will come back Maxixou I love Inbox but i use Gmail because Inbox accept only @gmail.com adress ... AlRegals Inbox for work email, Gmail for personal. Bruce Wayne Gmail. Michel S. Inbox on mobile, Gmail on desktop. Colin Richardson Inbox for people who want Automatic groups. Gmail for people who like to set it up themselves. Simples.

While Google’s competitor to the Amazon Alexa devices has been available in the U.S. since November, and in the U.K. since early April, Canada has been a “grey market” zone for the device. As we previously detailed, Google Home devices worked almost as well in Canada as it does in the U.S., save for a couple of niche features. (For example, multi-user support still isn’t available in Canada, and the device doesn’t support shopping.) Related No reason to wait for Google Home to officially arrive in Canada Google Inc. announced that its Google Home speakers were officially launched in the U.K. April 6, but Canada is still waiting. The search giant has promised 2017 access to the smart speaker hardware Published on: April 11th, 2017 Brian Jackson @brianjjackson On Sunday night, both Best Buy Canada and Amazon Canada listed the Google Home device as available to purchase and ship within Canada. Previously, Canadians could order the device from American retailer B&H Photo, but some Reddit users reported that option was no longer available. Amazon.ca lists Google Home as in stock and is priced at $226. Bestbuy.ca lists Google Home as an online-only item and on sale until April 30 for $226.00. Looks like it will be priced at $269.99 regularly. Check out our experience using Google Home in Canada so far.
