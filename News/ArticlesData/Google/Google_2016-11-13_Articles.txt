Login Search Tech Stock Roundup: AAPL Upgrade, GOOGL-EU, BABA Singles Day November 14, 2016, 03:04:00 PM EDT By Sejuti Banerjea, Zacks.com Shutterstock photo The election was the biggest event last week, easily blotting out everything else, especially because of the surprise President-elect. But that didn't stop a hot Apple AAPL rumor from KGI Securities analyst Ming Chi Kuo; or Alphabet's GOOGL defense of its Android ecosystem; or the gangbuster Singles Day numbers from Alibaba BABA . So read on… Apple May Not Upgrade iPhone SE KGI Securities analyst Ming Chi Kuo is famous for breaking Apple product-related news. This time, he's saying that the company may not refresh the budget iPhone "SE" line next year. The rationale is purportedly to boost demand for the more expensive and higher-margin iPhone 7, while also pressuring SE component makers to reduce prices. This pressure may increase because Apple is now selling refurbished, certified iPhones from its online store. The iPhone SE is a very competitive and lighter phone, especially if you can make do with a smaller screen and 64GB storage, don't mind a somewhat weaker front camera and more limited water resistance, and also really want the headphone jack. The analyst feels that not refreshing the SE, weaker China demand and lower 4.7-inch volumes will impact iPhone sales next year. He forecasts an iPhone shipment volume decline to between 35 and 40 million (40.4 million units were shipped in 2Q16). He also has reservations about component price declines. Google Defends Android Google has its rival Yandex to thank for this one, as the leading Russian search engine's (until it was displaced by Google) complaint to the Competition Commission precipitated proceedings. In 2013, Google rivals Microsoft MSFT , Nokia and Oracle ORCL had gone to the EU through an umbrella organization called Fairsearch. But it was hard to pin Google guilty, leading to the case dragging on. But when in Russia, Google required phone makers to pre-install Google search (just as everywhere else) instead of Yandex, the company went to court. In this case, the EU is investigating 3 angles as Techcrunch pointed out so well- that Google is allegedly "requiring and incentivizing" smartphone and tablet manufacturers to exclusively install its own services, and in particular its search engine that it is allegedly bundling certain Google products with other apps & services whether Google is hindering the ability of smartphone and tablet makers to use and develop other OS versions of Android (aka Android forks) If found guilty, Google will have to pay up to 10% of revenue, or around $7.4 billion. The crux of Google's response of more than 100 pages is that Google's practices are with a view to prevent fragmentation of the platform without which Android would be weakened and competition would in fact be impaired. It says that the Commission's decision to omit Apple as a competitor appears arbitrary and partisan. It makes no sense because the Commission's own survey revealed that 89% of respondents consider Apple and Android as competing platforms . Besides, it allows the Commission to conveniently ignore the fact that 39 out of 39 pre-installed apps on iPhone 7 are from Apple, and 39 out of 47 pre-installed apps on the Microsoft Lumia 550 are from Microsoft. Android has allowed phone makers to bring cheaper phones to the market and has helped millions of app developers. A weak platform would be bad for everyone. In the words of Kent Walker Google's general counsel, "The response we filed today shows how the Android ecosystem carefully balances the interests of users, developers, hardware makers, and mobile network operators. Android hasn't hurt competition, it's expanded it." Alibaba Singles Day Alibaba had a record Singles Day with sales of $17.79 billion, up from the record $14.3 billion last year and short of the $20 billion analysts were projecting. But these sales are nothing to scoff at: 2015 sales in the U.S. on Thanksgiving, Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined and from all stores (both online and offline) totaled $19.4 billion. This year, Singles Day moved across the border, with the top markets for Chinese goods being Russia, Spain, Israel, Ukraine and France. Top markets selling to the Chinese were Japan, U.S., South Korea, Australia and Germany. The most popular brands were Apple, Nike, New Balance, Siemens, Philips and Adidas. Around 37% of shoppers bought from international stores with virtual reality creating new experiences like Chinese customers browsing the isles of Macy's store in New York without ever leaving their seats. But clouds are looming for Alibaba with the election of Donald Trump. The company's business hinges on China-U.S. relations, so it will be negatively hit by Trump's decision to charge a heavy tax on Chinese goods. If the Chinese government reacts with similar duty on U.S. goods, Alibaba will be affected very badly. The other concern is with respect to its accounting practices, particularly with respect to its Singles Day sales, for which the company is being investigated both in the U.S. and in China.

Adam Mosseri, VP of product management at Facebook says, "In Newsfeed we use various signals based on community feedback to determine which posts are likely to contain inaccurate information, and reduce their distribution. In Trending we look at a variety of signals to help make sure the topics being shown are reflective of real-world events, and take additional steps to prevent false or misleading content from appearing. Despite these efforts we understand there's so much more we need to do, and that is why it's important that we keep improving our ability to detect misinformation." The company earlier formed an alliance with various media houses for similar reasons although the possibility of potential business partners colluding to suppress or misinform the public for vested interests is a bit unsettling. Singapore Civil Service Chooses Facebook Workplace : Singapore's civil service is adopting the Facebook Workplace platform for its pool of 143K (and growing) public servants by March 2017. The platform is inexpensive at just a dollar per user per month for groups larger than 10K people, so it's a good deal for Facebook as well. In fact, this is the first deal of its kind for Facebook and underscores the platform's popularity in Asia. Legal/Regulatory Irish Finance Minister Will Go to Bat for Apple : The EU Competition Commission has determined that Apple owes taxes to the tune of $14.5 billion for illegally transferring profits generated in Ireland to a titular head office in a tax free zone. Irish Finance Minister Noonan says that the Commission is acting out of its jurisdiction because tax is a matter decided by individual countries and the competition angle is just a back door to meddle in the member nation's internal affairs. The tax breaks enjoyed by Apple are part of state aid that some European countries resort to with the objective of attracting investment in the region. Apple has around 6K employees in Ireland. In September, the cabinet approved Ireland's joining Apple in appealing the EU's demand, and Noonan submitted his appeal last week. LinkedIn Banned in Russia : The professional network faces a ban in Russia because of a law passed in 2014, requiring websites storing personal data of Russians to store it in servers within the country, says Russia's Roskomnadzor communications watchdog. LinkedIn reportedly has 6 million users in the country, so it could be a near-term blow. However, the problem may not be long-lived given its pending acquisition by Microsoft. Amazon Refunds for In-App Purchases : A federal judge has ruled that Amazon AMZN must take the responsibility of informing and then refunding parents, when their kids run up bills related to unauthorized in-app purchases. While judge Coughenour agreed with Amazon that the $26.5 million decided by the FTC was too high, he ruled out lump sum payments and gift cards for the amount as Amazon would collect profit on goods sold through gift cards. In similar dealings, Apple and Google coughed up around $32.5 million and $19 million, respectively. Unauthorized purchasing has been curtailed however, with the help of improved controls since then. New Technology/Products Pre-Owned iPhones Now on Sale : Last September, when Apple introduced the concept of iPhone annual upgrades and AppleCare+ for $32 a month, I had speculated that they wanted to build inventory of phones on which manufacturing cost was already recovered to target emerging markets like India. But competitors protested this in India, so Apple needed a Plan B (which may have also been in the works actually). With the anniversary up, Apple would be receiving these phones about now. So it is selling these refurbished (new battery and outer shell) phones after testing and certifying them at a 15% discount through the app store and making a huge profit. Apple is reportedly selling eight versions, all with a one-year warranty. The decision is also of great strategic importance as it could prevent users from moving away to cheaper phones from competitors. It's also a way for Apple to further expand its user base, enabling it to sell more services. The current rates are $399 for the 4GB model, which sells for $499 at full retail and $499 for the 8GB model, which sells for $599. Facebook App for Emerging Markets : Facebook is determined to eat Snapchat's lunch and the leading social network is doing about all it can to replicate Snapchat-like features such as Instagram stories, "secret" (erased after some time) conversations and more. Now it's launched Flash, a Snapchat-like platform targeted at emerging markets like Brazil, Indonesia and India where the Facebook brand name is very well recognized. This may cap Snapchat's progress in emerging markets while strengthening Facebook versus this picture-sharing networking platform. Intel's New Chip Tech : Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland has called out Intel's high-speed, in-package optical interconnect silicon photonics technology as a product with the capacity to "revolutionize the semiconductor industry". As the analyst says, it will definitely mitigate the effects of a slowing Moore's law by reducing the interconnect time between Intel's Xeon Server CPUs and Altera's FPGAs, i.e. until Intel integrates the technology into a single piece. The analyst also said that Intel has "proof of concept" chips and is looking to improve current low production yields. This could lead to a commercial product just three to five years down the line. Rolland estimates that data transfer rates may start at 50 to 100 gigabits per second with the new chips, but could increase to a half terabit or 2 terabits by early next decade, he said. Google, Apple App Store Updates : Both Google and Apple have huge app marketplaces, which might make it difficult for developers to reach buyers. The two companies are therefore always looking for ways to help developers get their apps seen. Google had many encouraging announcements such as a) allowing developers to offer limited-time discounted subscription pricing for their apps b) a promise to expand the Google Play Store to wearables, VR headsets, and Chromebook laptops for easier distribution from a single marketplace and c) a decision to employ machine-learning algorithms more heavily to provide app recommendations for Google Play users. Apple, which earlier this year promised developers a bigger revenue share and more reviews for new apps, announced that they can now create early-access promotional codes for new apps that can be offered to journalists and reviewers. These should help them generate more publicity for their new apps and in-app purchases. Some Numbers Google Home vs. Amazon Echo : IHS Markit says that Google Home will solidly beat Amazon Echo by 2020, shipping 5.4 million units that year, while Amazon will be stuck at 2.4 million units. Amazon does have a first mover advantage right now, but it will evaporate over the years as Google uses its treasure trove of data to more fruitfully apply artificial intelligence according to the research firm. Apple is also expected to join the fray with a device based on Siri. The Google device is fifty bucks cheaper at $129, but lacks Amazon's skills (app ecosystem). This should be a very short-term hurdle as Google has the wherewithal to more than catch up here.

Google’s search engine is highlighting an inaccurate story claiming that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump won the popular vote in the Nov. 8, 2016, election, the latest example of bogus information spread by the internet’s gatekeepers. (Virginia Mayo, File/Associated Press) By Michael Liedtke | AP November 14 at 7:26 PM SAN FRANCISCO — Google’s search engine highlighted an inaccurate story claiming that President-elect Donald Trump won the popular vote in last week’s election, the latest example of bogus information spread by the internet’s gatekeepers. The incorrect results were shown Monday in a two-day-old story posted on the pro-Trump “70 News” site. A link to the site appeared at or near the top of Google’s influential rankings of relevant news stories for searches on the final election results. Google acknowledged the problem, although as of mid-afternoon Monday, the link to “70 News” remained prominent in its results. Although Google rarely removes content from its search results, the company is taking steps to punish sites that manufacture falsehoods. In a move disclosed Monday, Google says it will prevent its lucrative digital ads from appearing on sites that “misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information.” The action could give sites a bigger incentive to get things right or risk losing a valuable source of revenue. FAKE NEWS ON STEROIDS False information is nothing new on the internet, where debunkers have been batting down unfounded claims and urban legends for more than two decades. But the problem has gained more attention in the post-mortem of a bitterly contested presidential election in which Trump, a Republican billionaire and former reality TV star, defeated Hillary Clinton, a Democrat and former U.S. secretary of state who had been leading in the polls. Trump wound up prevailing in enough key states to win the Electoral College’s decisive vote, but is trailing Clinton in the overall popular vote with some ballots still being counted. Clinton’s lead in the popular vote has become one of the flashpoints in the protests against Trump’s election being staged in cities across the country. Google is just the latest company in the crosshairs. Fake news stories uncritically circulated during and after the election on Facebook have sparked a debate over the role of social media companies, which are key sources of news for large numbers of people. Critics suggest that these companies should be more careful to ensure they aren’t passing along misleading information. SOCIAL MEDIA AND THE NEWS Google’s dominant search engine is the leading source of traffic to media sites, according to the online analytics firm Chartbeat. Meanwhile, a study by the Pew Research Center found about 60 percent of Americans get at least some of their news from social media sites such as Facebook, which now has 178 million users in the U.S. and Canada. In the election’s aftermath, Facebook has been accused of possibly swaying the election’s outcome by promoting fake news stories on its social network. Last summer, the company fired a handful of journalists who oversaw its “trending” news list and replaced them with an algorithm; fake news stories quickly began to trend. CEO Mark Zuckerberg brushed off that criticism as “crazy “ in an appearance last week. He elaborated in a Saturday post on Facebook in which he asserted that “more than 99 percent of what people see” on Facebook is authentic. Zuckerberg conceded more needs to be done to block bogus information, but said that determining what’s blatantly wrong isn’t always an easy task. “Identifying the ‘truth’ is complicated,” Zuckerberg wrote. “While some hoaxes can be completely debunked, a greater amount of content, including from mainstream sources, often gets the basic idea right but some details wrong or omitted.” The stories featured in the feeds of Facebook users are primarily selected by automated formulas known as algorithms. Google’s search results are also powered by algorithms that the company regularly revises to thwart sites that attempt to artificially boost their prominence. MORE, BETTER ALGORITHMS? Google conceded its search engine misfired with the 70 News story that falsely declared Trump the popular vote winner in both its headline and the body of the text. “In this case we clearly didn’t get it right, but we are continually working to improve our algorithms,” the company said in a statement. Bad information in an online headline or at the top of a story can be particularly damaging. Roughly 53 percent of the people who land on a web page stay for 15 seconds or less, according to Chartbeat’s findings. Incorrect information is bound to ripple across the internet as more people rely on their phones, computers and other digital devices to read news that is picked out for them by automated programs, said media analyst Ken Doctor of Newsonomics. “What we are seeing is the failure of the algorithm,” Doctor said. “These algorithms bring a lot of things into our lives that humans cannot do. But when algorithms fail, it highlights the fact that they are not just some kind of neutral technology. They are programmed by human beings and they have all the failings of human beings.” It’s difficult to know what happened when an algorithm goes awry because Google, Facebook and other internet companies closely guard how they work, much the way Coca-Cola protects the recipe for its soda. But the growing power that Google and Facebook hold over the flow of information could increase the political pressure for them to be held more accountable, Doctor said. In the meantime, most people remain skeptical about what they read online. Only 4 percent of Americans have a lot of confidence in what they read on social media sites, according to Pew. Local news organizations fared better in Pew Research’s survey earlier this year, with 22 percent of Americans saying they trusted the information there. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

BV Presents Events Election 2016 Google Play Music undergoes complete overhaul By BrooklynVegan Staff November 14, 2016 1:59 PM SHARE TWEET EMAIL REDDIT EMAIL REDDIT Google Play Music has recently undergone an overhaul in an attempt to stay competitive in the ongoing streaming wars. Google’s attempt to stick out involves a proposed huge degree of personalization, with the Google Now features that revolve around personal recommendations being applied to the streaming service. Via The Verge: Using machine learning and clues like location, activity, and weather, the app tries to serve up a smorgasbord of playlists that will match your mood and moment. “At a high level, Google’s mission is to make the world of information really accessible and useful to people,” said Elias Roman, the lead product manager for Google Play Music. Google Now might do that by suggesting you leave for the airport early to avoid bad traffic on the highway. “There is a role for Google to play in music that is similar.” Every time you open the app, it completely refreshes what you see, trying to serve the perfect selection. Tapping the app on Saturday night I got options for a cocktail party playlist and some serious dancehall jams. When I opened it again late Sunday afternoon, I got offered a playlist for relaxing at home and another for cooking dinner. The interface, based on cards, feels a lot like Google Now, and so does the approach to just-in-time doses of pertinent information, in this case the tunes you need. That sounds not unlike the now-defunct Beats Music, and it makes sense for complete personalization to be a selling point for Google given how their other products try to aim directly at the user.

(Google) ED CARSON 11/14/2016 Reprints Alphabet (GOOGL) unit Google and Facebook (FB) said Monday that they will ban fake news sites from using their advertising networks, after misinformation online become an issue during the presidential election. "Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose of the web property," Google said in a statement. Facebook added fake news sites to misleading, disruptive and illegal sites, which are barred from its Facebook Audience Network. Mobile apps and third-party sites use the Facebook Audience Network to show ads with Facebook. Google's AdSense network is a major source of revenue for many sites. So the Facebook and Google shift could curb the financial incentive for fake news sites. Americans increasingly get their news from Facebook, Twitter (TWTR) and other social networks or search engines, rather than via established media players. That's opened the door for the spread of false news stories. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg had previously said that false stories didn't sway the outcome of the presidential election. Google itself served up fake news on Sunday, with search results for "final election numbers" highlighting a false news story that claimed Trump won the popular vote. Google, which said it's been working on the new policy since before the election, has similar bans on sites with pornographic or extremely violent content. Alphabet shares fell 2.4% on the stock market today while Facebook lost 3.3%, both tumbling below their 200-day moving averages as investors dump big-cap techs. Twitter rose 3.2% after hedge fund Jana Partners disclosed a small stake.

The policy change is imminent, Google spokeswoman Andrea Faville told Reuters. "Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose of the web property," she said in a statement. The policy change comes amid an intensifying debate over how much responsibility technology companies bear for monitoring the accuracy of content as more and more people access news through sites such as Facebook rather than traditional media companies. Facebook, in particular, has been criticized over the spread of inaccurate articles promoting U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on the site. Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has denied that the site influenced the outcome of the election. Google's AdSense advertising network is a key financial driver for many publishers. The company places various restrictions on where its ads may be placed, including bans on pornographic and violent content. Work on the policy update began before the election, Faville said.

So why not your favorite operating system? Apparently, Google thought so too… It’s a big and expanding social network, after all, and a presence there is only going to strengthen the Google property’s image across the board. It is not exactly clear what the company plans to do to promote itself, however, as only six uploads have so far been made. The bio reads “A grid of sweet treats and #AndroidAdventures,” which suggests that it could be used for virtually anything Android-related. Other than the obligatory “Hello world” shot, the six pictures have been posted so to make up one big, singular header, where a few of Google’s initiatives are featured. We can see a Nexus 6P as well as a Pixel smartphone and a Pixel C, a few Android Wear watches and services like Pay and Auto scattered all throughout. There are also a few jelly beans, lollipops, marshmallows and nougat bites — sorry, no Android O hints just yet. The weirdest thing seems the profile picture, where the signature android is holding a Nexus 6P rather than a Pixel. But this is Google we’re talking about, so on second thought there’s nothing to be really shocked about. Guides Android Breaking news for Android. Get the latest on apps, carriers, devices, and more!

The company’s co-founder and CEO, Cathy Edwards, is now head of engineering and product development for image search at Google, according to the report, a change which is reflected on her LinkedIn profile. Edwards was previously an Apple engineer… Little is known about the under-the-radar startup, other than that it “focused on turning online searches into purchases” and that it “raised less than $1 million in financing” before being snatched up by the Mountain View company (via Bloomberg). The report suggests that this move reflects Google’s further interest in turning its huge image search database into a source of revenue. Perhaps giving us a little bit more insight into what this acquisition will mean for Google’s Image Search, a designer at the startup by the name of Stefanie Kraus described the tool on her website: The purchase research tool offers education around the product space and allows customers to customize their shortlist based on individual needs and preferences. By introducing a filtering system that takes “nice to have” and “ideal” into consideration, we make sure that the products are presented in a meaningful way. Stefanie was listed as principal UX designer for the startup on her LinkedIn profile until October.

(Photo: Justin Sullivan, Getty Images) SAN FRANCISCO — Facebook isn't the only source of fake news on the Web. Alphabet's Google was dragged into the muck Monday, when its search engine prominently displayed an obscure right-wing blog, 70news.wordpress.com, that falsely claimed President-elect Donald Trump won the popular vote in last week's election.  (Hillary Clinton leads Trump by nearly 700,000 votes, but Trump won in the Electoral College, according to the Associated Press.) "The goal of Search is to provide the most relevant and useful results for our users. In this case we clearly didn’t get it right, but we are continually working to improve our algorithms," Google spokeswoman Maggie Shiels said in a email statement. The results popped up under a Google search banner called  "In the News" when a user searched for "who won the popular vote." As of Monday evening, the blog's post was still there, though it followed stories that referenced the erroneous results. In the News is different from Google News (news.google.com.) The blog's publisher said it had based its information on "twitter posts" over the weekend, specifically one from user @koxingA8. The dust-up, on the heels of criticism that Facebook was a breeding ground for misinformation during the run-up to the presidential election, is more fodder for a national debate on the responsibility of social media and other types of technology that broadly disseminate information to billions of people worldwide. Most news carried on Google's search engine comes from established media sources such as the New York Times and CNN, according to data analysis from journalists at the University of Maryland. Later Monday, Google said it would remove sites it had found to be providing fake news from its advertising program. The erroneous blog post is sure to give technology another black eye in what has been mounting criticism about its propensity to amplify misleading information across broad digital platforms. Facebook has been assailed for prominently featuring fake news on its site, prompting CEO Mark Zuckerberg to deny it unwittingly helped Trump become president-elect. He said 99% of news on the social network is "authentic," and has vowed to weed out fake news. Late Monday, the company said it would pull ads from fake news sites. USA TODAY Facebook employees form fake news task force “In accordance with the Audience Network Policy, we do not integrate or display ads in apps or sites containing content that is illegal, misleading or deceptive, which includes fake news," Facebook said in a statement. "While implied, we have updated the policy to explicitly clarify that this applies to fake news. Our team will continue to closely vet all prospective publishers and monitor existing ones to ensure compliance." USA TODAY Zuckerberg vows to weed out Facebook 'fake news' A group of Facebook employees, meanwhile, have formed an unofficial task force to refute Zuckerberg's claim that the company bears no responsibility for the spread of fake news, according to a BuzzFeed News report.

(AP Photo/Virginia Mayo, File) SAN FRANCISCO—Google’s search engine highlighted an inaccurate story claiming that President-elect Donald Trump won the popular vote in last week’s election, the latest example of bogus information spread by the internet’s gatekeepers. The incorrect results were shown Monday in a two-day-old story posted on the pro-Trump “70 News” site. A link to the site appeared at or near the top of Google’s influential rankings of relevant news stories for searches on the final election results. Google acknowledged the problem, although as of mid-afternoon Monday, the link to “70 News” remained prominent in its results. FAKE NEWS ON STEROIDS False information is nothing new on the internet, where debunkers have been batting down unfounded claims and urban legends for more than two decades. But the problem has gained more attention in the post-mortem of a bitterly contested presidential election in which Trump, a Republican billionaire and former reality TV star, defeated Hillary Clinton, a Democrat and former U.S. secretary of state who had been leading in the polls. Trump wound up prevailing in enough key states to win the Electoral College’s decisive vote, but is trailing Clinton in the overall popular vote with some ballots still being counted. Clinton’s lead in the popular vote has become one of the flashpoints in the protests against Trump’s election being staged in cities across the country. Google is just the latest company in the crosshairs. Fake news stories uncritically circulated during and after the election on Facebook have sparked a debate over the role of social media companies, which are key sources of news for large numbers of people. Critics suggest that these companies should be more careful to ensure they aren’t passing along misleading information. SOCIAL MEDIA AND THE NEWS Google’s dominant search engine is the leading source of traffic to media sites, according to the online analytics firm Chartbeat. Meanwhile, a study by the Pew Research Center found about 60 percent of Americans get at least some of their news from social media sites such as Facebook, which now has 178 million users in the U.S. and Canada. In the election’s aftermath, Facebook has been accused of possibly swaying the election’s outcome by promoting fake news stories on its social network. Last summer, the company fired a handful of journalists who oversaw its “trending” news list and replaced them with an algorithm; fake news stories quickly began to trend. CEO Mark Zuckerberg brushed off that criticism as “crazy ” in an appearance last week. He elaborated in a Saturday post on Facebook in which he asserted that “more than 99 percent of what people see” on Facebook is authentic. Zuckerberg conceded more needs to be done to block bogus information, but said that determining what’s blatantly wrong isn’t always an easy task. “Identifying the ‘truth’ is complicated,” Zuckerberg wrote. “While some hoaxes can be completely debunked, a greater amount of content, including from mainstream sources, often gets the basic idea right but some details wrong or omitted.” The stories featured in the feeds of Facebook users are primarily selected by automated formulas known as algorithms. Google’s search results are also powered by algorithms that the company regularly revises to thwart sites that attempt to artificially boost their prominence. MORE, BETTER ALGORITHMS? Google conceded its search engine misfired with the 70 News story that falsely declared Trump the popular vote winner in both its headline and the body of the text. “In this case we clearly didn’t get it right, but we are continually working to improve our algorithms,” the company said in a statement. Bad information in an online headline or at the top of a story can be particularly damaging. Roughly 53 percent of the people who land on a web page stay for 15 seconds or less, according to Chartbeat’s findings. Incorrect information is bound to ripple across the internet as more people rely on their phones, computers and other digital devices to read news that is picked out for them by automated programs, said media analyst Ken Doctor of Newsonomics. “What we are seeing is the failure of the algorithm,” Doctor said. “These algorithms bring a lot of things into our lives that humans cannot do. But when algorithms fail, it highlights the fact that they are not just some kind of neutral technology. They are programmed by human beings and they have all the failings of human beings.” It’s difficult to know what happened when an algorithm goes awry because Google, Facebook and other internet companies closely guard how they work, much the way Coca-Cola protects the recipe for its soda. But the growing power that Google and Facebook hold over the flow of information could increase the political pressure for them to be held more accountable, Doctor said. In the meantime, most people remain skeptical about what they read online. Only 4 percent of Americans have a lot of confidence in what they read on social media sites, according to Pew. Local news organizations fared better in Pew Research’s survey earlier this year, with 22 percent of Americans saying they trusted the information there.

The social network has updated its advertising policies to spell out that its ban on deceptive and misleading content now also applies to fake news. The shift in policy comes as Google, Facebook and Twitter all faced a backlash over the role they played in the U.S. presidential election.  Facebook has announced a crackdown on the spread of 'fake news' sits by trying to limit the amount phony sites can make in advertising. The sites were accused of spreading false and often malicious information that might have swayed voters towards Republican candidate Donald Trump. And the debate became so fierce, that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg was forced to insist twice in recent days that his social network had no role in influencing the election. But announcing new measures today, a statement on Facebook said: 'We do not integrate or display ads in apps or sites containing content that is illegal, misleading or deceptive, which includes fake news', adding that it will continue to vet publishers to ensure compliance.

Share this article Share However, Facebook's steps are limited to its ad policies, and do not target fake news sites shared by users on their news feeds. Meanwhile, search engine Google has also said it is working on a policy change to prevent websites that misrepresent content from using its AdSense advertising network. Google's move similarly does not address the issue of fake news or hoaxes appearing in Google search results. Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, pictured,  was forced to insist twice in recent days that his social network had no role in influencing the election Nor does Google suggest that the company has moved to a mechanism for rating the accuracy of particular articles. Rather, the change is aimed at assuring that publishers on the network are legitimate and eliminating financial incentives that appear to have driven the production of much fake news. The company said in a statement: 'Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose of the web property.' The company did not detail how it would implement or enforce the new policy. AdSense, which allows advertisers to place text ads on the millions of websites that are part of Google's network, is a major source of money for many publishers. A report in BuzzFeed News last month showed how tiny publishers in Macedonia were creating websites with fake news - much of it denigrating Clinton - which were widely shared on Facebook. That sharing in turn led people to click on links which brought them to the Macedonian websites, which could then make money on the traffic via Google's AdSense. Facebook has been widely blamed for allowing the spread of online misinformation, most of it pro-Trump, but Zuckerberg has rejected the notion that Facebook influenced the outcome of the election or that fake news is a major problem on the service.  Search engine Google has also said it is working on a policy change to prevent websites that misrepresent content from using its AdSense advertising network In a blog post on Saturday, he wrote: 'Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99 percent of what people see is authentic. Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes.' Meanwhile, Fil Menczer, a professor of informatics and computing at Indiana University who has studied the spread of misinformation on social media, said Google's move with AdSense was a positive step. He said: 'One of the incentives for a good portion of fake news is money. This could cut the income that creates the incentive to create the fake news sites.' However, he cautioned that detecting fake news sites was not easy. He added: 'What if it is a site with some real information and some fake news? It requires specialized knowledge and having humans (do it) doesn't scale.'  Share or comment on this article e-mail 63 shares Most watched News videos Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Man discovers wife is cheating on him following her with drone Chili's manager snatches veteran's free meal after complaint Obama on Trump: This office has a way of waking you up SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Emotional Chelsea Handler fights back tears over election results 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob Dashcam footage captures moment van swerves before crashing Obama's dig at Clinton over her ground game failures Pres.

President Young Sohn said when talking about the South Korean company’s $8 billion deal to buy Harman International Industries Inc. is that the electronics giant has no intention of building a car. The emphasis was intentional. Samsung’s target customers are carmakers who’d love to give their vehicles smartphone-like capabilities but are leery of surrendering unfettered access to their dashboards. They’ve largely kept a distance from Google, which could mine driver data for its own uses, or Apple Inc., which until recently had designs on building its own car. Samsung wants to marry its consumer electronics expertise and the fast 5G cellular network it’s developing with Harman’s presence in dashboards all over the world. If it works, they can offer carmakers a lightning-quick connected system for infotainment, mapping, concierge services and autonomous driving -- and all without the worry that the automakers would be helping a future competitor. “This is not about building a car,” Young said in an interview. Several automakers “came to us and asked us to help with technologies like 5G, or artificial intelligence or memory. We can harness technologies to provide a better experience to automakers.” Samsung offered $112 a share in cash for Harman, which was 28 percent above the Stamford, Connecticut-based company’s closing price of $87.65 in New York on Friday. The stock closed up 22 percent to $109.72, the biggest gain since its 1986 initial public offering. Samsung’s own shares rose on the deal, which was announced after the market closed Monday. The stock climbed as much as 1.8 percent as of 9:45 a.m. in Seoul. The acquisition reverberated through the car business, with Wells Fargo analyst David Lim saying in a research note that the deal could “ignite additional mergers and acquisitions of higher technology auto suppliers.” The shares of automotive electronics maker Visteon Corp. jumped 9.6 percent -- the most since August 2012 -- and larger rival Delphi Automotive Plc gained 2.2 percent. Deals like Samsung’s for Harman could be welcome by automakers, who want to control the revenue from connected car services and the customer data it generates as much as possible, said Jim Hines, a research director at Gartner. ‘Competitive Dynamic’ “There is definitely a competitive dynamic that has emerged between the established automotive industry and these large tech companies that are looking to get a piece of that market opportunity,” Hines said. As automakers have rolled out connected services in their cars, they have been very careful in how they work with Google and Apple. General Motors Co. allows its customers to connect their smartphones into the dashboard through Apple’s Car Play and Google’s Android Auto -- but only with selected apps, and the phones cannot access a car’s data. Toyota Motor Corp. doesn’t allow its cars to connect to either system. The fear among carmakers is that Apple and Google could either mine the data inside the car, tracking everything from driving patterns to engine performance, to either become a new face to the consumer or to help them build cars. The fact that Harman is already a supplier and that Samsung doesn’t have a system that competes with the in-car connected services sold by carmakers could make them a more attractive partner, Hines said. Partner or Threat? “They might be viewed as less of a threat in terms of tech partner for some of these leading automotive brands," Hines said. Samsung wants to become a high-tech supplier capable of building connected systems. Its expertise is making the hardware, like microprocessing units, and a faster 5G network to deliver more data to cars faster. Harman sells -- among other technologies -- 3D navigation, apps for integrating other devices into the car, active safety systems and audio systems that can access the cloud. There are a lot of opportunities once the companies combine, Harman Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dinesh Paliwal said in a phone interview. Imagine a car that that can read a driver’s daily schedule and automatically dial into a conference call, Paliwal said. Autonomous driving will only give drivers access to more connected capabilities for work or entertainment, he said. "We’ll be in the best possible position because we have all the capabilities," Paliwal said. Overcoming Weaknesses Exclusive insights in your inbox, from our technology reporters around the world.

You will now receive the Game Plan newsletter Assuming the merger goes through, Samsung will need to develop other capabilities, especially in software, said Cyrus Mewawalla, lead analyst at CM Research. Like Google and Apple, Samsung wants to own and provide the servers, the hardware that’s doing all the computing and the memory storage for connected cars. They also want to own the platform that runs the apps, in the way that Apple’s iOS and Android do now. While they have expertise in some things like microprocessors, they don’t have all of those capabilities, Mewawalla said. “They’d need more than just this acquisition,” he said. “The two key weaknesses Samsung has is the software ecosystem and cloud infrastructure, and that’s where it needs to be acquiring." Artificial intelligence, in which Samsung has recently made a deal, should be a particular area of focus in the near future, he added. If it chooses, the company could also have the resources to develop such capabilities on its own once Harman’s 8,000 software engineers and join Samsung, which spends $13 billion a year on research and development and $23 billion in capital expenditures. “Imagine the scale of our R&D," Paliwal said.

The latest: Google’s search engine came under fire Monday for highlighting an inaccurate story from the pro-Donald Trump site 70news claiming that he won the popular vote in last week’s election; a link to the site appeared at or near the top of Google’s influential rankings of relevant news stories for searches on the final election results. Meanwhile, Facebook has been under fire for how false news stories that it helped to spread could have influenced the election. Does charity begin at Apple? Apple is making it easier for people to give to charities by expanding its Apple Pay payments service to nonprofits, including the American Red Cross and the United Way. Apple Pay can speed transactions because people don’t have to re-enter card and contact information, though people need to enable the service first. PayPal paying piper for picking pols Politics may make strange bedfellows, but it also leads to a lot of get-out-of-my-bed, fellas. Take San Jose’s PayPal, which got flack and threats of boycotts from conservatives in April — even getting a story on Breitbart — because it veered away from expanding to North Carolina because of a state law that targeted gays. Now it is one of 12 companies being boycotted by a new group called the DJT Resistance because co-founder Peter Thiel (who left the company when eBay bought it in 2002) and big investor Carl Icahn backed Donald Trump.

Google doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with the working abilities of the launcher beyond Pixel and Pixel XL – but it is what it is. At the same time, Microsoft has updated its own Arrow Launcher to take on what Google has with their Pixel phones. We previously went over a small number of phones Pixel launcher works on. Now, in addition to the Pixel and Pixel XL and CyanogenMod 14, we’ve confirmed that some phones with CyanogenMod 13 work, too. Our original report has been updated, and users of most phones from the past two years (new phones) should be able to use the launcher. They should, that is, just so long as they’re using CyanogenMod 13 or 14 when they make the attempt. For those users that cannot access the app through Google Play, there’s an APK Mirror listing. The most recent update to the app via APK Mirror is Pixel Launcher 7.1.1-3359438 from October 19th, 2016 as of press time for this article. This is the same version we’ve tested with both most recent versions of CyanogenMod. Microsoft’s update to Arrow Launcher comes just as the Google Pixel and Pixel XL hit stores – and the latter device is re-stocked online. This update to Arrow Launcher adds memory efficiency, bug fixes, and the return of the widgets pack from a previous iteration of the app. This version also adds icon size customization – though we stress that modifying the size of Android icons may very well make pages look quite crazy. Microsoft added several features that were likely inspired by the Pixel launcher from Google. The most prevalent of these features is the ability to add shortcuts to app icons. Users could also potentially have all of Google’s newest icons by downloading the Pixel icon pack from Google Play by Saurabh Gupta. Microsoft’s Arrow Launcher is also available through Google Play and is, as always, delivered without cost. This app was updated on the 8th of November, 2016 to version number 2.6.0.27593. Users will find that they’ll need Android version 4.0.3 and up if they want to make use of the app. Story Timeline ADW Launcher 2.0 official: time for Android fun New Nexus phones might also have a new app launcher Google Nexus launcher apk download released for Android Android Nougat MR1 to bring Google Assistant, new Launcher Nexus Launcher becomes Pixel Launcher, confirms brand change Nova Launcher update gifts Nougat to old Androids Tags AndroidgoogleGoogle PixellauncherpixelPixel XLsmartphone Must Read Bits & Bytes 2017 Honda Civic Hatchback First Drive Jaguar I-PACE Concept previews Model X rivaling EV for 2018 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar Review (late-2016) Surface Book with Performance Base Review 7 ways I’ll escape or mobilize today with technology Latest Headlines Xiaomi Mi Mix bend test shocks with heartiness Nov 15, 2016 Nintendo Switch reportedly shuffles major launch titles Nov 15, 2016 Super Mario Run release date and pricing revealed Nov 15, 2016 eBay mobile app updated in time for holiday shopping Nov 15, 2016 NHTSA “Quiet Car” safety standard will make hybrids and EVs noisy Nov 15, 2016 Latest Reviews MacBook Pro with Touch Bar Review (late-2016) Nov 14, 2016 Surface Book with Performance Base Review Nov 10, 2016 Google Daydream View Review Nov 10, 2016 LG V20 Review: Stealing the Note 7’s spotlight Nov 4, 2016 Living with Google Home Nov 3, 2016 Search © 2005-2016 SlashGear, All Rights Reserved.

Public Address, a community of blogs Hard News by Russell Brown 10:53 Nov 15, 2016 59 The fake news problem The Washington Post, Buzzfeed and others are reporting something strange and troubling today: a fake news site falsely claiming that Donald Trump and not Hillary Clinton has won the popular vote in last week's US Presidential election is the top search result in Google News. The result of the popular vote is, I'm sure you know, immaterial to the result of the Presidential election – but it carries a undeniable moral weight. Equally obviously, the claim is simply untrue. Clinton will ultimately win between one and two million more votes than Trump. I don't know enough about the way the Google News algorithm works to say exactly what's gone in here, but I can guess and say that the currency of the story – the number of times it's been cited and linked to – pushed it to the top of the news search results. This isn't immutable. The Post's screenshot of the result looked like this: By the time Buzzfeed screenshotted its search result, the Post's story had hove into view, for presumably the same reasons the fake story was elevated. Another report by Business Insider found other debunking stories beginning to populate the results: So debunking fake news is worth doing. But I tried the same search just now – and the fake story is still the lead result. Google isn't doing this deliberately. It's not a corporate plot. Remember, Eric Schmidt, the executive chair of Google's parent company Alphabet Inc, was an informal advisor and donor to Barack Obama. He's also an investor in The Groundwork, a data company used by the Clinton campaign. So what the hell is 70News and how is this happening? The Post's story notes that the report on the Wordpress-hosted 70News is based on a tweet, which in turn cites USASupreme.com – a site which occasioned the memorable Wonkette headline Hillary Clinton Threatened To Murder Bernie Sanders, Says Credible Not-Russian-Sounding News Site back in August. The Wonkette story is worth reading for its forensics on how that particular fake news story was put together. A couple more things about USASupreme: whoever writes it appears not to have English as a first language – and they freakin' love Wikileaks and Julian Assange. That story concludes: So once again Assange the man who exposed the truth about Hillary Clinton to the world has confirmed that Trump is clean and it is the democrats that made so many bad decision over the last couple of years. USASupreme also really likes – and I'm guessing this isn't going to come as a total surprise to you – Vladimir Putin: The belief that Hillary Clinton, if elected, was going to precipitate World War III was remarkably popular in the weeks and months before the election, especially amongst professed left-wingers. Does USASupreme spring from the bowels of the now infamous building in St Petersburg where a "troll army" labours to influence the beliefs of Russian and other citizens? We can't tell. But this story on what happened when Swedes debated whether to join NATO – a flood of confusing information and outright falsehoods into the public discourse – is interesting. And sobering: The claims were alarming: If Sweden, a non-NATO member, signed the deal, the alliance would stockpile secret nuclear weapons on Swedish soil; NATO could attack Russia from Sweden without government approval; NATO soldiers, immune from prosecution, could rape Swedish women without fear of criminal charges. They were all false, but the disinformation had begun spilling into the traditional news media, and as the defense minister, Peter Hultqvist, traveled the country to promote the pact in speeches and town hall meetings, he was repeatedly grilled about the bogus stories. “People were not used to it, and they got scared, asking what can be believed, what should be believed?” said Marinette Nyh Radebo, Mr. Hultqvist’s spokeswoman. Further down: “The dynamic is always the same: It originates somewhere in Russia, on Russia state media sites, or different websites or somewhere in that kind of context,” said Anders Lindberg, a Swedish journalist and lawyer. “Then the fake document becomes the source of a news story distributed on far-left or far-right-wing websites,” he said. “Those who rely on those sites for news link to the story, and it spreads. Nobody can say where they come from, but they end up as key issues in a security policy decision.” Although the topics may vary, the goal is the same, Mr. Lindberg and others suggested. “What the Russians are doing is building narratives; they are not building facts,” he said. “The underlying narrative is, ‘Don’t trust anyone.’” And: “The Russians are very good at courting everyone who has a grudge with liberal democracy, and that goes from extreme right to extreme left,” said Patrik Oksanen, an editorial writer for the Swedish newspaper group MittMedia. The central idea, he said, is that “liberal democracy is corrupt, inefficient, chaotic and, ultimately, not democratic.” Another message, largely unstated, is that European governments lack the competence to deal with the crises they face, particularly immigration and terrorism, and that their officials are all American puppets. Sound familiar? Every time during this US election campaign that I got involved in a social media argument with someone telling me things about Ukraine or Syria – which was far too many times – I'd find myself explaining that I actually follow a few people who cover those conflicts closely, and none of them say that's what's happening. Sadly, I was often referred to screeds by John Pilger that didn't tally with any reliable reporting either. Meanwhile, the Wikileaks Twitter account gushed with misleading, out-of-context or outright false characterisations of material from its email troves. The Infosec Taylor Swift account has been on a tear about this over the past couple of days: "WikiLeaks spreads information." Like telling bigoted nationalists how Hillary's campaign murdered a dude and is run by satanists? Remember? pic.twitter.com/Bex8OIBX7z — im a cat now meow (@SwiftOnSecurity) November 11, 2016 And it's still happening: Yes, you can literally die and, against your family's own wishes, Assange will go on national TV and lie about your death for his own lols. pic.twitter.com/XlcWHeb2m0 — im a cat now meow (@SwiftOnSecurity) November 14, 2016 In truth, it'll be hard to tell what proportion of the bullshit is deliberately propagated and how much is simply an exploitation of the click-counting programmatic environment in which news must dwell these days. I don't think Mark Zuckerberg likes fake news any more than you and I do – it's just that the business model has evolved around it. The cancer has incorporated itself into the body. This is not to say that Clinton, the USA and liberal democracy itself are blameless innocents in the world. But something pretty nasty is happening here. And by the way, a white supremacist publisher of fake news is going to be chief strategist in the Trump White House. But I will tell you one thing: think twice before you complain about the "mainstream media". News organisations aren't perfect, but they've been basically your only bulwark against all this. Indeed, one of the few pleasures of the ghastly Presidential campaign was discovering the work of a host of good journalists – from David Farenthold at the Post to feisty independents like Sarah Kendzior. It's not just the Post and the Times, it's  Buzzfeed and Snopes and a hundred others. It's all those people literally put in a pen at Trump rallies. It's going to be a tough few years for some of them. A couple of days ago, Silicon Valley investor and "contrarian" Keith Rabois posted a string of tweets along these lines. Wait until journalists learn that today's AI is close to writing news stories on par or better than they do. — Keith Rabois (@rabois) November 12, 2016 He seemed to enjoy the idea. We should run screaming from it. As Facebook moved from human curation to trust arficial intelligence to sift it stories, fakery exploded. It was a Google algorithm, not an editor, that made a wholly false claim about the popular vote the "top" story in its rankings. The idea that AI will actually write most of the news we see is genuinely horrifying. Be nice to the next journalist you see. You'll need us. 59 responses Email Share Tweet 59 responses to this post First ←Older Page 1 2 3 Newer→ Last Stephen Judd, 11:03 Nov 15, 2016 Email Web Twitter I know a surprising number of people on Twitter who seem to love RT as a source.

North Shore, Auckland • Since Nov 2006 • 12304 posts Report Reply David Herkt, 11:14 Nov 15, 2016 Exactly. And enough is enough. I have been noticing 'robot news' for a while now, and its willing human servitors (by that you can practically add every media outlet in the world now too, with their stories by click-bait for click-bait). Over the last year, I have found myself checking stories that appear apparently genuine but when double-checked, even just clicking on other things on the alleged sites, one finds something seriously wrong... Indeed, it is getting to the stage you could almost premise a new paid media outlet on the fact that it hosts no fake news or click-bait... I'm also disturbed by the complete insulation those pesky little algorithms give is where literally we can see nothing other than what we might agree with or like - I've been a TV researcher for an occupation and I need to find diversity of views. I'd hate to think what the Google algorithms make of my search history but in the short term it is only too obvious... You can nearly see how your searches change the results and the associated ads immediately... It is one reason I still like hard-copy magazines and newspapers. One gets a comparatively unmediated chunk of the world, as opposed to just the stuff you can be bothered clicking. An eye across a page is a swifter means of information-gathering than any number of clicks. But, yes, despairingly, the little bubbles we live in... and it was only too clear watching American voters in the recent election.

It has been hard watching people on the NZ left re-tweet writers who are egging on war with Syria. It isn't just loons who see a no fly zone as the beginning of a war against Russia. Before anyone asks, no, I don't think Trump was a better option. The Putin hysteria has also been awful and is one of the fakest news stories of the year. Yes, Russia deploys propaganda, and yes, there is admiration on the right for the tough-guy/thug images of both Trump and Putin. But many establishment writers (IE, working for largish organisations) in the US went insane hyping up the story. Here is Kurt Eichenwald writing for Newsweek: Western intelligence and law enforcement say tens of thousands of people have been working with Russia on its hacking and disinformation campaign for many years. They include propagandists and cyberoperatives stationed in Moscow, St. Petersburg and Novosibirsk, located in the southwestern part of Siberia. Operations have also been conducted in the United States, primarily out of New York City, Washington, D.C., and Miami. Those involved include a large number of Russian émigrés, as well as Americans and other foreign nationals. Intelligence operations in Europe and the U.S. have determined that the money these émigrés receive for their work is disguised as payments from a Russian pension system. One U.S. official says there is evidence many of these Americans and foreign nationals do not know they are part of Russia’s propaganda operation. Emphasis mine. This is race baiting bullshit. Trump talks about Muslims and 'Islamic Extremism' in much the same way.

Wellington • Since Nov 2006 • 3578 posts Report Reply Russell Brown, in reply to Tom Burleigh, 12:24 Nov 15, 2016 Email Web Twitter I’ve been hard on Russell on Twitter in the run-up to the election. It has been hard watching people on the NZ left re-tweet writers who are egging on war with Syria. This is just a meaningless statement. No one is “egging on war with Syria”. As recently as September, the US reached agreement with Assad and the Russians to focus on Isis and al-Nusrah. Syria agreed to cease bombing defined civilian areas. It fell apart when Assad and Russia rained hell down on Aleppo. See Amnesty International: Syrian and Russian forces targeting hospitals as a strategy of war and this, also from Amnesty: The Syrian government, with Russia’s support, has without a doubt used air power to deliberately inflict suffering on civilians, routinely bombing densely populated civilian areas and buildings. For several years, there’s been a clear pattern of government bombardment as a means of punishing populations in areas controlled by the armed opposition. But there is more to it than that. Over the past year, Amnesty International has documented a pattern of deliberate attacks on hospitals in the north of Aleppo governorate in what appears to be part of a military strategy to empty towns and villages of residents, in order to pave the way for ground forces to advance. It is this same strategy that Syrian government forces are now using to gain control of Aleppo city. The city’s besiegement – coupled with the impotence of the UN Security Council and others – has empowered Russia and the Syrian government to attack civilians with impunity and leave only one option for Aleppo residents to escape the horror – forcing them to evacuate to government-controlled areas. Once the city is emptied of people, the government can seize control and claim victory. It did this last month too in Daraya, near Damascus, which the remaining inhabitants reluctantly agreed to completely evacuate after four years of brutal siege and bombardment. One of the most despicable things that people kept linking me to was the Pilger screed in which he twisted all kinds of facts to depict the FSA as no different to Isis and basically characterised the bombing of Aleppo as taking out the trash. Fuck him and every other apologist for what’s happening. Fuck them and their undying love affair with former Communist strongmen. It isn’t just loons who see a no fly zone as the beginning of a war against Russia. I didn’t see how Clinton’s idea would work. But that’s not the same as “starting World War III’. And saying so is just reciting words.

I logged into failbook recently to see about 500 notifications of US bullshit, and luckily a "47 of your 49 friend have marked themselves safe", plus a post from one of the others - looks as though he hasn't signed up to that sub-system. Unfortunately my RSS feed has been about 50% news of the US, but just marking alternet and The Guardian-Politics feeds as read clears a big chunk of that out. But there's still PA and other more personal blogs like DimPost going on about it. Whatever, we don't know enough to do anything useful and we have no influence over the result. For all the difference it makes I'd rather look at pictures of cats (or expensive cameras, but you know, whatever). Australian politics has been bad enough of late - the "good" news is that Australia might be shipping some refugees from our torture camps to the US. That might, however, test the "anything is better than this" theory if the Trump-is-a-nazi doomsayers are correct. In other Australian news, same-sex marriage and a Treaty are still out of the question but the constitutional amendment to say "you exist, now shut up" to the abos[sic] is still on the cards.

(It wasn't exactly a Big Oil fest – one of the keynotes was the European Commission Climate Action commissioner.) Yes, that does sound less alarming than picking a handful of donors out of a list of hundreds (the Council has begun listing every donor over $250, which is welcome – think tanks do need an eye kept on them). Indeed, one could equally say that the Council "takes money" from such evil interests as Penguin Random House, the Open Source Policy Center and LexisNexis, and it would feel pretty different. The Council's biggest donor is the philanthropist Adrienne Arsht, who is best-known for her support of performing arts projects and funding programmes to help Hispanic and disabled young people. I know Global Research will tell you different – but RationalWiki's assessment of Global Research and its countless conspiracy theories (from Jews to vaccines) is a bracing read. Honestly, this happens every single time I follow up these statements – they never add up to the claim made.

(Shelby Lum/Richmond Times-Dispatch via AP) Donald Trump unquestionably won the 2016 presidential election, but he is trailing in the popular vote. That might come as a surprise to people who Googled the phrase "Final Election Count" as late as 2 p.m. on Nov. 14. The first entry in Google’s news category -- above those from news links to the Washington Post and Politico -- was a Nov. 12 post (updated the following day) from a little-known site called 70news. "Final election 2016 numbers: Trump won both popular (62.9M-62.2M) and Electoral College Votes (306-232)," the post’s headline said. Further down the page, the site’s anonymous author wrote, "To all the liberal loonies still rioting because you claim Trump did not get the popular vote, get your meds now and prepare to be shocked because the finals results are in. Trump got 306 Electoral College vote while Hillary Clinton got 232. For #PopularVote: #Trump: 62,972,226 #Clinton: 62,277,750." According to its Facebook page, the site launched in August and seeks to "share news that matters to you. What liberal media will try to hide, we will uncover." Here’s a screenshot of how that particular Google search displayed the 70news post -- prominently. But while it’s absolutely true that Trump won the Electoral College vote -- which is the only thing that matters in determining who moves into the White House on Jan. 20 -- he is not leading in the popular vote. The most comprehensive vote-tracking analysis is published by David Wasserman of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. As of 2:30 p.m. on Nov. 14, according to Wasserman’s calculations, Clinton led Trump by 784,748 votes -- specifically, 61,422,098 for Clinton, 60,637,350 for Trump, and 6,691,311 for other candidates. Other tallies showed similar results. CNN at that time showed a Clinton-over-Trump margin of 668,059, while the Associated Press had a margin of 668,483. (Different media outlets may report different numbers at a given time because of delays in obtaining and uploading new data.) Here’s CNN’s tally by mid-day Nov. 14, showing Clinton ahead by half a percentage point. And given the votes left to be counted, it’s almost impossible to imagine that Trump will gain back ground in the coming days. That’s because California -- a state where Clinton is beating Trump by a 62 percent-33 percent margin -- has the most votes still to count of any state. Nearly a week after the election, CNN estimates that only 70 percent of the California vote had been counted. In addition, only 87 percent of the vote in Oregon had been counted; Clinton beat Trump 52 percent-41 percent there. And Washington state had counted only 87 percent of its vote; Clinton beat Trump there by a 55 percent-38 percent margin. So it’s entirely plausible that Clinton could end up winning the popular vote by 1 million to 1.5 million votes -- roughly two or three times the popular-vote margin assembled by Al Gore when he lost the Electoral College, and the presidency, to George W. Bush in 2000. By Nov. 14, the Washington Post and Business Insider both posted articles questioning why Google still had the 70news article at the top of their news category. A Google representative said the company was looking into the issue. And on Nov. 14, 70news posted an update: "Anyone asking where I got the figures, it was from twitter posts. … If I’m wrong, I won’t hesitate to change the numbers. It’s the job of the establishment media to tell the people the final numbers when it’s out there already." (The Twitter post cited by 70News was this one.) But as of 3 p.m. on Nov. 14, 70news still had the article up. Our ruling Social media was abuzz with the claim that the "final election 2016 numbers" showed that Trump had won won both the popular and Electoral College contests. Trump certainly won the Electoral College vote, and as a result, he will become president. But he clearly trails in the popular vote. As of this writing, Clinton is ahead by nearly 800,000 votes, a margin that is likely to expand further as late returns trickle in from California, Oregon and Washington state, all of which are strong Clinton states. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.

Early on Monday, internet users were surprised to discover that while trying to find the latest on the US elections (they are still counting ballots), the top Google news story claimed that Donald Trump had won both the electoral college and the popular vote. This is, of course, not true and the story in question comes from one of an ever-expanding number of news sites that use the same style as real news reports, but repeat or invent wildly inaccurate and misleading information, typically with a strong political bias. The fact that Google not only linked to the story but also, for a while, had it listed as the top result, has added to an increasing sense of unease over the impact of fake news on people's lives, and their decisions. On Saturday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was forced to defend his company against accusations that the social media giant had unwittingly swayed the tight election race in Donald Trump and the Republican Party's favor, thanks to the prevalence of fake news stories on its service. "After the election, many people are asking whether fake news contributed to the result, and what our responsibility is to prevent fake news from spreading," Zuckerberg wrote online. "Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99 per cent of what people see is authentic. Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes. The hoaxes that do exist are not limited to one partisan view, or even to politics. Overall, this makes it extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election in one direction or the other." Lies, damn lies and statistics Of course, Zuckerberg did not break down what "content" means and some have been quick to point out that if you pull out material that was not related to the election (the bulk of it), then that percentage would rocket. Or, in other words, there is a serious problem with people picking up fake news on Facebook. Facebook's increasing importance as a source of information for people has caused previous blow-ups: from a backlash that resulted in the company inviting conservative voices to its headquarters to discuss how it would remain unbiased in news coverage; to the hiring and then firing of journalists to filter content. Originally, Facebook intended to use human editors to clear out click-bait stories that frustrated users, but during the election season the same holes were increasingly used to inject fake political stories into the social media service – stories that were then repeated and amplified across other online services. In this most recent example, flagged by Google, the website references other also-fake sources of information, which themselves reference other fake news sources, creating an entire string of misinformation. Social scientists and psychologists have long concluded that if people hear the same information from multiple sources – typically between three and five – they become convinced of its truth. As for Google, it used to require smaller news websites to fill out an online application to be considered as a news source, with each application reviewed by a human. That process changed a few years ago, however, when the search giant tweaked its news algorithm and now a much larger range of sources appear on its news page. Google did not respond to requests for how the fake news site managed to get so high in its rankings – and it wasn't just for a single specific search but multiple different variations of searches for election results – and it has yet to comment on the controversy more generally. However, this being the self-regarding internet, currently the biggest news stories for "final election results" on Google are stories about Google ranking a fake news story. ® Sponsored: Customer Identity and Access Management Tips and corrections 28 Comments Whitepapers Data and Analytics Maturity Model and Business Impact How top performing enterprises use their IT investments to store, process, and use data to make more effective, real-time decisions.

BAIG Last updated 11:00, November 15 2016 Reuters Daydream is a step up in price and class compared to the Google Cardboard virtual reality viewers that Google and its partners make available. Here's the chief reality behind Google's virtual reality headset: it all boils down to content. In the week that I've had to test Daydream View, I not only craved more VR content, but wished more of the Daydream experiences I tried blew me away. Only a select few apps were made available by Google for this review. Still, the beauty and promise of all virtual reality is that it places you somewhere that would be difficult if not near impossible for most of us to experience day-to-day. And as a mobile VR solution along the lines of Samsung's Gear VR, Daydream does give you a hint of that promise. Google's headset was unveiled in September and went on sale in Australia and the US last week. You can't buy it in New Zealand yet. I particularly enjoyed poking around YouTube VR. In one video I landed in the Artic, within virtual spitting distance of a polar bear and cub. In another, I got to see what it was like in the depths of the Isle of Jaws, a hotbed for great white sharks. It was also fun watching movie trailers on the virtual gigantic screen theatre inside Google Play, though I'm not convinced I'd commit hours of wearing Daydream on my head to take in an entire film. But I'm getting ahead of myself. WHAT YOU NEED For now, you'll need to buy one of the two recently launched Google smartphones, the Pixel or the Pixel XL, to experience Daydream, since these are the only compatible phones on the market. Reuters Google Daydream only works with the company's Pixel phones. More capable Android handsets are on the way, and so are more capable Daydream-ready apps. Google expects Daydream phones to arrive in the coming months from Samsung, HTC, ZTE, Xiaomi, Alcatel, Asus, LG, Motorola, and HTC. Huawei's recently announced new Mate 9 Pro is also going to work with Daydream. In the slowly evolving consumer ecosystem for virtual reality, you can lump Daydream in with the Oculus-powered Samsung Gear VR. Gear VR also only works with a limited set of smartphones, for now all models from Samsung. Daydream is a step up in price and class compared to the Google Cardboard virtual reality viewers that Google and its partners make available. And like Gear VR, it is way cheaper and accessible, albeit less compelling, than the pricey Oculus Rift or HTV Vive machines that need to be tethered to powerful computers, or the PlayStation VR system that Sony sells, which connects to PlayStation game consoles. DAYDREAM VERSUS GEAR VR Daydream is made of a light breathable fabric and it is more compact and comfortable to wear than the hard plastic Gear VR, which at times felt heavy on the bridge of my nose. Both headsets can be worn over eyeglasses. You start out by placing the Pixel on a tray and closing a latch that is secured by pulling an elastic loop over a nub. The outer edge of your phone remains exposed so that you can plug in headphones. Ad Feedback As you pull the Daydream over your head, you'll want to ensure a tight fit by adjusting a strap. I found that the headset sometime slid down slightly on the front of my face. That's important not only for comfort but for a proper focus. There's no focus wheel like there is on Gear VR, which means that how sharp the images appear to you inside Daydream directly correlates to how the thing lays on your face. Another big difference between Daydream and Gear VR is that Google's set comes with a separate wireless oblong controller, which has a clickable touchpad and a few buttons for controlling apps, volume and the action in whatever VR experience you're involved in. On Gear VR, there's a built-in touchpad along the right temple, so this is a big advantage for Google. Samsung has more apps at the moment. I like having the separate controller but sometime had to fuss with the controls to make the cursor appear inside an app or the Daydream Home forest environment, which is the starting place for finding content and accessing the Play Store. You can stow the controller inside Daydream when you're not using the headset; its kept in place by an elastic band, minimising the chance that you'll misplace it. The Daydream controller has a USB-C charging port that is compatible with the cable that comes with the Pixel. According to the Google the controller, battery will last about 12 hours or more than a day in standby mode. Most concerning, however, is the fact that the battery inside the Pixel phone appears to be draining pretty quickly when you're using Daydream, and the Pixel itself runs exceedingly hot. I'm not suggesting you're facing the kind of risk that required Samsung to recall its Note 7 device (which was one of the phones that worked with Gear VR), just that this is something you really notice. BRING ON THE CONTENT In the end, of course, Daydream will live or die by the content you get to watch. Among the experiences I got to try and enjoy was an outerspace simulation called Star Chart VR, which let me travel from Earth to Mars to Saturn. Inside a Google Arts & Culture app, I viewed audio-guided masterpieces by van Gogh and other artists. And back inside YouTube, I especially enjoyed watching and listening (via spatial 3D audio) the Does Not Exist VR beatboxing video from Reeps One. I also played a game called Mekorama in which you try to help a small robot navigate puzzling mechanical dioramas. In another, called Wonderglade, which seems more suited for young kids, I played carnival games in a theme park. Still, I wanted more. Google lists numerous apps it says will reach Daydream before the end of the year. Many are from such media properties as BBC, CNN and the New York Times. A number of entertainment-oriented apps are also on the list, including HBO Go, Hulu VR, Jaunt, the NBA, NextVR and Netflix. And more games are coming too, ranging from Need for Speed: No Limits VR from EA to Home Run Derby by Major League Baseball. Bringing them on will make virtual reality that much more real and engaging.  - MCT Saved|Saved Stories Saved|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Next Gadgets story: There's a tech battle brewing over whiteboards that cost thousands of dollars Technology Homepage Comments technology headlines Twitter to thwart cyber-bullying Live: 7.5 New Zealand quake Sleeping woman burnt by iPhone PS4 Pro: Hands on review An optimist on the future of energy Consumer drone market slumps Review: Watch Dogs 2 Where did you go Kendall?

Image Credit: Getty Images "Final Election Count" Google results promote a dangerous right-wing hoax with false info By Melanie Ehrenkranz November 14, 2016 SHARE TWEET PIN Donald Trump was elected president of the United States, but Hillary Clinton won the popular vote — and her lead is growing. So why does the leading Google search result indicate that Trump won the popular vote? And why is the top story from such a sketchy source? Google search results for "final election count" bring up false information. Source: Mic/Google When you Google search "final election count," the top search result is a factually incorrect story that suggests that Trump won both the popular and Electoral College votes. He didn't.  The story is from 70News, a far-, far-right-leaning Wordpress blog. 70News' headlines include things like "THE STEVE BANNON HYSTERIA: IF TRUMP CHIEF STRATEGIST IS CAUSING LEFT-WING MEDIA MELTDOWN, IT MEANS TRUMP DID THE RIGHT THING... HE'S PERFECT FOR THE SPOT!" and an entire vertical dedicated to "Hillary's Health." Why does fake news rise to the top of Google searches? Google uses algorithms to determine what websites appear in searches, crawling through websites and keywords to "find the appropriate pages" and ordering them in your search results. But in the aforementioned search results, the algorithm deemed a false, far-right blog post, a website dedicated to debunking rumors and an article about Google's spread of misinformation as the "appropriate pages" for "final election count." The failure of algorithms to differentiate reliable, unbiased news from sensationalism, hoaxes or factually incorrect "news" speaks to a larger issue at hand: While tech companies aren't responsible for writing the news, they are responsible for governing the news they distribute.  In other nooks of the web, massive sites like Facebook and Twitter have also seen their networks inundated with viral hoaxes — a pitfall that places the onus of fact-checking on its users. How does misinformation spread? "Personally I think the idea that fake news on Facebook, which is a very small amount of the content, influenced the election in any way — I think is a pretty crazy idea," Zuckerberg said two days after Trump was elected president, Quartz reported. "Voters make decisions based on their lived experience." Zuckerberg is downplaying the influence of his platform. Facebook is curating and delivering news to millions of people with its News Feed feature, which algorithmically ranks trending stories and presents them to you on your homepage. In a Facebook post, Zuckerberg claimed that "more than 99% of what people see [in the Trending section] is authentic." But studies show otherwise: BuzzFeed's analysis found "38% of all [hyperpartisan right-wing] posts were either a mixture of true and false or mostly false, compared to 19% of posts from three hyperpartisan left-wing pages that were either a mixture of true and false or mostly false." The Washington Post performed its own audit and found similar results. Twitter was also hit with a stream of hoaxes leading up to the election. Internet trolls schemed to flood the social media site with fake hashtags and memes in order to quell support for Clinton — they tried to dupe left-wing voters into casting their ballots via invalid methods like texting and tweeting. Six days before the election, Twitter finally addressed the voter suppression by blocking accounts. "Not sure how this slipped past us, but now it's fixed," Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said, according to BuzzFeed News.  Dangerous hate movements are entering the mainstream — and social media is responsible In New York magazine, Max Read argued that tech companies and their faulty algorithms had a decisive role in swinging the pendulum into Trump's camp. One major problem, he notes, is that Facebook's viral hoaxes look so real: "Many of those stories were lies, or 'parodies,' but their appearance and placement in a news feed were no different from those of any publisher with a commitment to, you know, not lying." Facebook, Google and Twitter's influence is undeniable. It's this influence that gave the far-right, white-nationalist platform Breitbart News a record audience — and paved the way for Breitbart executive chairman Stephen Bannon to become Trump's senior counselor and chief West Wing strategist. The real issue moving forward isn't just the continued spread of misinformation, as we saw in Monday's Google search result for the final election count — but also the dangerous ideologies that have taken center stage on social media, bolstered by Trump's campaign. In 2016, tech companies' determination to remain unbiased and not stir the political pot has inadvertently given white nationalism a major platform. When Trump supporters are able to silence victims of death threats on Facebook and use coded speech to spew racist abuse in plain sight on Twitter, it's time for these companies to reevaluate how much they lean on algorithms and consider their responsibility to govern the growing hate movements that have blossomed on them.

Most Popular GIF YouTube What's Inside By Eric Limer Nov 14, 2016 Snapchat's Spectacles, sunglasses with a camera embedded in the frame so you can take videos, are all the rage at the moment. Available for $130, but only from vending machines that pop up at random (or for way, way too much money on eBay), the camera specs are already far trendier than Google's ill-fated Glass could ever hope to be. But what are they, exactly? It only takes one pair and a Dremel to find out for sure. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below After getting their hands on a pair of the glasses, the folks over at What's Inside took to cutting a pair in half to figure out what's really going on in there, and the answer is actually quite simple. The specs have two yellow circles at the top, outside edge of each frame. One of these holds the camera, which shoots the video that plays back in a strange, circular aspect ratio. The other holds the lithium-ion battery (which obvious goes up in flames if you cut into it) and the Bluetooth guts that connect the frames to your phone. The two units are joined by a copper wire running through the frame, so make sure you don't snap them in half! Most Popular The coolest trick that the Spectacles can do isn't thanks to its (fairly simple) hardware, but rather software. Because the footage the camera actually captures is cropped into a circular type shape, Snapchat can pull of a very cool trick with the resulting video, letting it morph and change as you twist your phone while viewing it. Those who aren't understanding @Spectacles videos. Here's the only GIF you need. pic.twitter.com/CDXfCpM2PM — Raymond Wong 💾📼🍕 (@raywongy) November 14, 2016 Various apps from YouTube to Instagram to Vine (RIP) have been slowly legitimizing the once horrible sin of taking vertical video, either by supporting a vertical aspect ratios better or opting for something more square-shaped. Snapchat's cool little rotation trick, however, is probably the coolest solution so far. Here's to hoping that it catches on, even/especially for videos that aren't taken by some goofy-looking camera glasses.

SSLMate Features Cert Spotter Intro How It Helps How It Works PKI Threats PKI Failures Pricing API Open Source Pricing Blog Docs Log In Sign Up ← Back to blog September 7, 2016 Why Chrome 53 is Rejecting Chase Bank's Symantec Certificate Update (Thursday, November 10, 2016): Due to a bug in Chrome, versions of Chrome 53 that are more than 10 weeks old now display this error message for all websites using Symantec certificates that were issued on or after June 1, 2016 (including from Symantec-owned brands like Thawte and GeoTrust). As of Friday, November 11, 2016, Chrome users can simply restart Chrome to avoid the bug. Chromium users must upgrade. Website operators can switch to a certificate from a different certificate authority. (SSLMate issues Comodo certificates, which are not affected.) The rest of this post still applies to new versions of Chrome. If you're using Chrome 53, which was released last week, you might find that some websites which worked under Chrome 52 now fail with "Your connection is not private" with an error code of NET::ERR_CERTIFICATE_TRANSPARENCY_REQUIRED. For example, choosemyreward.chase.com shows the following error as of publication time: The short explanation is that Chase's system administrators made a mistake when they requested their SSL certificate from their certificate authority, Symantec, but as we shall see, Symantec shares responsibility too. The History of Certificate Transparency The security of HTTPS relies on organizations called certificate authorities, who issue certificates that help ensure your connections to websites are secure and private. HTTPS is only secure if certificate authorities do their job properly. If a certificate authority messes up and issues an unauthorized certificate, an attacker can use it to intercept HTTPS connections. Unfortunately, it's difficult to ensure that certificate authorities do their job properly, and certificate authorities have repeatedly violated the public's trust by issuing unauthorized certificates, including ones which have been used in real attacks against HTTPS connections. In response, Google created Certificate Transparency. Under Certificate Transparency, all certificates are submitted to publicly-auditable logs by either the certificate authority or a third-party observer such as the Googlebot. Domain owners can monitor these logs using a service like Cert Spotter and take action if they see an unauthorized certificate for one of their domains. Web browsers will eventually reject certificates that aren't logged using Certificate Transparency. However, Google is proceeding slowly towards mandatory logging so that they and others can gain operational experience first. The first milestone towards mandatory logging came in January 2015 when Chrome started requiring Certificate Transparency for Extended Validation certificates. The second milestone came last October, when Google caught Symantec, a large certificate authority, issuing unauthorized "test" certificates for google.com and 75 other domains. Since issuing certificates for a domain without its owner's approval is such a serious violation of trust, Google announced that Chrome would require Certificate Transparency for all certificates issued by Symantec on or after June 1, 2016. This change rolled out last week in Chrome 53. Symantec and Certificate Transparency Symantec is, for the most part, complying with Google's logging requirement, and by default any certificate they issue will be properly logged and will work in Chrome 53. However, Certificate Transparency has a downside: it requires the complete contents of every certificate, including the hostnames, to be logged to a public log. For a public website, this is no big deal, but some organizations prefer to keep the hostnames of their internal servers private. Even the hostnames of public websites might need to be kept private until a certain date to avoid leaking information such as new product announcements or corporate acquisitions. To address the privacy concerns, the IETF working group responsible for Certificate Transparency developed a redaction mechanism which would allow certificate authorities to redact components of the hostname beneath the registered domain. For example, a certificate for secretserver.secretdivision.example.com could be logged as ?.secretdivision.example.com, ?.?.example.com, but not ?.?.?.com. Redaction allows domain owners to keep their hostnames private, while still allowing them to detect that a certificate has been issued for some hostname under their domain. Unfortunately for Symantec, there were some obstacles in the way of offering redaction to their privacy-sensitive customers. First, redaction is only defined for the next version of Certificate Transparency, which is still a draft and has not been implemented by Chrome or any public log server. Second, the Chrome team has raised several concerns with redaction, and stated that Chrome will not support redaction unless their concerns are addressed. Partly because of Chrome's concerns, the IETF working group removed redaction from the next version of Certificate Transparency and placed it in a separate document which has not yet been officially adopted by the working group. Despite the fact that redaction, practically speaking, does not exist, Symantec forged ahead and grafted redaction onto the original version of Certificate Transparency. The result is a Franken-certificate that works fine in browsers that don't support Certificate Transparency, but fails to validate in Chrome. Pointless Redaction Symantec defaults to logging certificates in a compliant, unredacted form, but they provide their customers the option to log certificates in redacted form instead. Customers who choose this option get Franken-certificates that cause the above warning in Chrome 53. Despite the incompatibility with Chrome and the utter pointlessness of redacting the certificates of public websites, both Chase Bank and United Airlines have chosen to redact such certificates. United fixed their websites before Chrome 53 became stable by replacing their certificates with fully-logged ones, but as of publication time, choosemyreward.chase.com is still serving a Franken-certificate that's rejected by Chrome 53. Data collected from Certificate Transparency logs reveal quite a few other websites that are probably public yet use redaction, including websites at Amazon, Fedex, Goldman Sachs, Mitsubishi, and Siemens. Why would someone choose redacted logging for a public website? Symantec's documentation might be to blame. Their documentation describes the two options as follows: Full domain names: Publicly logs root domain names and subdomains in the certificate. Recommended for all public websites. Only root domain names: Publicly logs only root domain names in the certificate. Intended only for private internal domains. Although they say that logging root domain names is "intended only for private internal domains" while recommending full domain name logging for public websites, they don't mention the downside until later in the document: All certificates with root domain logging may display browser warnings when users connect to the website. Saying that a warning "may" be displayed doesn't seem adequate when a warning absolutely will be displayed, by the world's most popular web browser to boot! Symantec needs to do a better job informing their customers of the downsides of choosing redaction. Too many websites have chosen redaction incorrectly, and I expect this to continue unless Symantec improves their messaging. Meanwhile, Chrome users will encounter avoidable browser errors when visiting these websites, which is a horrible experience for Symantec's customer's customers, and risks desensitizing people to security warnings. Finally, if you represent an organization that wants to use redaction appropriately (that is, to hide the hostnames of a non-public server), please send an email to the IETF working group mailing list. The working group has had a difficult time designing redaction, and addressing Chrome's concerns will require hearing from the people who want to use redaction. The fate of redaction depends on your input! If you're worried about certificate authorities like Symantec issuing unauthorized "test" certificates for your domains, you should check out Cert Spotter, a tool to monitor Certificate Transparency logs for unauthorized certificates.

The new version promises a better experience, consuming fewer resources. By Matt Asay | November 14, 2016, 11:35 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: iStockphoto/monsitj As the world shifts to mobile, Google is doing everything in its power to accelerate that shift, going so far as to take a mobile-first approach to its celebrated search index. Everything, that is, except improve the Chrome browser so that it doesn't greedily gobble every system resource it can find. Chrome has been such a hog that simply using Apple's Safari browser has become a sure-fire trick to gaining an extra hour of battery life. Finally, however, the Google Chrome team is catching up with the rest of Google's mobile militia, promising significant improvements to resource utilization in Chrome 55, an update promised for December 2016. For those of us who love the work Google has done to promote mobile, but have been frustrated by its foot-dragging on Chrome, this is very welcome news. Chrome keeps marching on despite itself Google Chrome has steadily gained market share for years, to the point that it has now displaced the hitherto dominant Internet Explorer on the desktop and Safari on mobile devices. Though once a rounding error, Google's combination of minimalistic design, integration of the search function, and raw speed put it ahead of more cumbersome browsers in terms of market share, both on the desktop: Desktop Browser Market Share, November 2016 Credit: Netmarketshare And on the increasingly important mobile devices (including smartphones and tablets): Smartphone/Tablet Browser Market Share, November 2016 Credit: Netmarketshare And yet, that original speed and performance advantage that Chrome could once credibly claim has vanished. Though some suggest that Chrome's prerendering and other functions offer ample rationale for Chrome's piggy ways, the fact remains that rival browsers like Safari manage to give a great experience without consuming all the RAM on one's machine. Praise Chrome 55 Fortunately, this is about to get better—much better—in Google's upcoming Chrome 55 release, due in December. According to the Google developers responsible for Chrome, "Over the last few months the V8 team analyzed and significantly reduced the memory footprint of several websites that were identified as representative of modern web development patterns." More about Mobility CIO Jury: 10 out of 12 tech leaders trust Samsung despite Galaxy Note7 failure IBM Watson is coming to the iPhone, and that's big news for business users Tech Pro Research: Social media policy Subscribe to TechRepublic's Mobile Enterprise newsletter How "significantly"? Heap memory is down roughly 50% on average, while zone memory falls 40%. In addition, "Reducing the V8 heap page size from 1M to 512KB results in a smaller memory footprint when not many live objects are present and lower overall memory fragmentation up to 2x." This, in turn, "allows V8 to perform more compaction work since smaller work chunks allow more work to be done in parallel by the memory compaction threads." While these improvements don't promise significant improvements to battery life, they're a step in the right direction. They're also in keeping with Google's other deeply significant work on prioritizing its mobile search index. This should push more publishers to similarly prioritize the optimization of content for the mobile devices that serve as umbilical cords for most of us. This should translate into a better mobile experience which, again, is where we spend most of our time. Fortunately, for those of us that default to Google Chrome, we'll not only get a better content experience on our smartphones, we'll now also not destroy our device's memory resources by preferring Chrome.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Fake news is becoming a problem on social media and even Google. Regardless of where we stand politically, the results of the 2016 election will dominate the news cycle for a long time. That includes the frightening trend of fake news on social media, something that even Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has owned up to. In fact, fake news marked a portion of this weekend’s episode of Last Week Tonight from HBO and John Oliver. You can watch that here. I embedded it at the right time, but in case that doesn’t work the discussion about fake new starts at 12:15. Now, The Washington Post has a story on Google’s search engine falling victim to the problem. Following the election last week, Google offered the results on its search engine. The top news story it linked to for a while was literally faked and false. That story linked to this tweet as its source. Final #Election2016 Results By Numbers:- #PopularVote #electoralvotes pic.twitter.com/uKZevQvPfK — Michael (@Koxinga8) November 12, 2016 That Twitter user points to an article on a site called USASupreme.com for its source. That site offers no source for its count. That news story indicated that Trump had won the popular vote as well as the Electoral College votes, though that’s not true. At the most recent count, Clinton holds 61,039,676 of the popular vote compared to Trump with 60,371,193. Don’t trust everything you read online I’m not writing this story to highlight that difference; instead, I offer that it’s becoming a scary time to live as a reader of news online. If fake news outlets have become good enough to not only trick Facebook and Twitter users but Google’s algorithm itself, we have a serious problem on our hands. Zuckerberg’s saying that just 1 percent of news of Facebook is fake. That may or may not be true; but, that percentage doesn’t really indicate how much the fake news is actually shared. Sure 1 percent of the stuff posted on Facebook is fake, but how much more often is that fake news shared than the real stuff? How about if it’s especially inflammatory? As readers, we can’t take anything at face value. If a story seems too good to be true, check the organization and the linked sources. Perhaps platforms have a responsibility in this, too. I wouldn’t be opposed to Facebook adopting some sort of “verified” news outlet icon for bigger outlets. They have to do something to curb this stuff, right?

A partnership between the South Dakota State University Image Processing Laboratory and Google Earth made this possible. This image of the North America combines approximately 60,000 Landsat 8 images from July 2013 through December 2015. The red-orange areas are what imaging engineer Larry Leigh calls “gold nuggets,” areas that may one day be used to calibrate satellite sensors. Article ID: 664606 Released: 10-Nov-2016 3:05 PM EST Source Newsroom: South Dakota State University Add to Favorites more news from this source Share MEDIA CONTACT Available for logged-in reporters only CITATIONS CHANNELS Technology KEYWORDS satellite calibration, pseudo-invariant calibration sites, Google Earth Engine, Landsat Satellites, Satellite Imagery Analysis, South Dakota State University, SDSU Image Processing Laboratory + Show More Newswise — A South Dakota State University research team led by imaging engineer Larry Leigh has completed the first worldwide search for new satellite calibration sites through a partnership with Google Earth. The one-year project was made possible through a $46,000 Google Earth Engine research award. Through this collaboration, Leigh and his team of three graduate students have direct access to the Google archives that include EROS images and the computing power to compile the images via Google Earth Engine and its cloud computing capabilities. The primary project goal was to identify pseudo-invariant calibration sites or PICS. These are remote places, such as deserts and dry lake beds —where the surface properties and therefore the reflectance, do not change over time. PICS provide a less expensive means of calibrating satellites because it eliminates the need to gather measurements on the ground when the satellite is passing overhead. “When a satellite observes these test sites, it should measure the same amount of energy each time,” explained Dennis Helder, director of the SDSU Image Processing Laboratory. “You don't have to put a team in the field at the site or do a lot of data processing from the field team's measurements,” he pointed out. After these new sites are thoroughly characterized, Leigh said, “they can be used as routine calibration sites, thus increasing our frequency of observation and improving our ability to detect calibration drift in a much shorter time period.” Most satellites are calibrated on a somewhat irregular basis; however, the discovery of more sites may make daily calibration possible, he noted. Using nine spectral bands from Landsat 8, the team produced what Leigh called “our first-ever PICs global survey.” The global image, degraded to a 300-meter resolution, took nearly 350 hours to produce. “This output is being analyzed to generate a whole new list of PICs,” he added. However, he noted, Landsat 8 has only been in orbit a little over three years. The next step will be to run the Landsat 5 archive, which contains nearly 30 years of data—from March 1984 until June 2013. This will allow the researchers to evaluate the longevity of these new PICs and possibly use these sites to calibrate data from past Landsat missions. To identify PICS in the United States, Leigh and his team have produced a composite image containing 60,000 Landsat 8 images from July 2013 to December 2015. It took the 5,000-node cluster at Google approximately nine hours to compile the U.S. image at a degraded 900-meter, rather than the full 30-meter, pixel resolution. About SDSU Image Processing Laboratory The SDSU Image Processing Laboratory was started in 1988 to conduct research in satellite image processing. Research focuses primarily on radiometric characterization and calibration of satellite and airborne visible and near infrared remote sensing imaging systems. The lab works primarily with the Landsat series of sensors, but also has experience with high resolution commercial sensors such as Ikonos, Quickbird, and Orbview, RapidEye, Thaichote, and other moderate resolution sensors such as ALI and Hyperion. Projects have been primarily with USGS EROS (Sioux Falls, SD) and NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (Greenbelt, MD). Other areas of research include estimation of sensor point spread functions (or modulation transfer functions), and geometric characterization of sensor systems.

But what happens if you ask them about the competition? Curious, I did just that while testing the two smart speaker systems last week. It turns out that neither knows much about the other — or if they did, they didn’t want to acknowledge it. When I asked Google Home what it knew about Amazon Alexa — the name the company gives its virtual assistant technology — Home responded that it wasn’t “sure how to help.” I got essentially the same answer when I asked Home about Amazon Echo, the name of the smart speaker system. Echo was even less helpful. When I asked Alexa what it knew about Google Home, it didn’t even respond! Interestingly, the situation was different when it came to Siri, Apple’s virtual assistant that’s now built into its phones, tablets and computers. Both Home and Echo were able to tell me what Siri was. Citing Wikipedia, Home said Siri is “a computer program” that’s a part of the company’s operating systems. Alexa defined Siri as “Apple’s virtual assistant and phone control interface.” Not bad. Perhaps most tellingly of all, Siri was much more caught up on its two rivals than either were about each other. When I asked Siri about Home, she pointed me to the Wikipedia page describing the device. She did the same thing when I asked about Echo. Of course, Siri had her own problems, as she usually does. She too didn’t know what Amazon Alexa was. And the first time I asked her about Echo, she told me, “I can’t answer that.” She pointed me to the Wikipedia entry only after my second query. Ah, virtual assistants. It turns out they’re about as reliable as real assistants can be — maybe even less. Photo: Google Home (left), Amazon Echo.

Here’s how to link your Spotify account to your Google Home to play all of the third-party music you’d ever want. RELATED ARTICLE How to Set Up Google Home Just like Alexa, you can change the default music service. So, by simply saying “Ok Google, play The Weeknd”, it will automatically use Spotify to play music instead of Google Play. You can even tell Google Home to play a specific Spotify playlist. You can still use Google Play Music when you want—you just have to say “play Drake on Google Play Music”—it just won’t be the default. The same goes for Pandora as long as you have your Pandora account linked, or other services. When you first set up your Google Home device, it asked you to select a music provider that you wanted to use, so if you chose Spotify then and linked your account, then you’re good to go, but if you stuck with the default and are now wanting to switch to Spotify, here’s how to get started. First, open up the Google Home app on your smartphone and tap on the Devices button in the top-right corner of the screen. Next, tap on the menu button in the upper-right corner. Select “Settings”. Tap on “Music”. Choose “Spotify” from the list. A pop-up will appear telling you to link your Spotify account to your Google account. Tap “Link Account”. Tap on “Log In to Spotify”. Enter in your username and password for Spotify (or select “Log In with Facebook” if you usually log in that way) and then hit “Log In”. Tap “Okay” to confirm linking your Spotify account to your Google account. Spotify will now be your Google Home’s default music provider. If at any time you want to unlink your Spotify account, simply tap on “Unlink”. From now on, any music requests that you make to your Google Home will go through Spotify, and you can tell it to play your Spotify playlists without even saying “Spotify” at all. Simply saying “Ok Google, play my Christmas playlist” will tell the Google Home to search your Spotify library for that playlist and begin playing it.

 Snapchat is doing everything it can to avoid the creepy nerdiness of Google Glass Alex Heath Nov. 14, 2016, 3:13 PM 6,803 facebook linkedin twitter email print Spectacles marketing vs. an infamous photo of tech figure Robert Scoble wearing Google Glass in the shower. Snap / Robert Scoble The last thing Snap Inc. wants is for its new Spectacles to become the next Google Glass. Google released Glass in 2013 to much fanfare in the tech industry. Some thought the head-mounted display, which projected information like phone notifications and the weather over a glasses lense, would usher in the future of augmented reality computing. That didn't happen. Google Glass was a complete flop. Those who wore them were called "Glassholes." Google never iterated past a $1,500 developer prototype, and quietly killed the project two years later. Seriously, would you be caught wearing these on a date? Kyle Russell/Business Insider A pair of Spectacles is like the anti-Glass. For starters, there's no fancy augmented reality tech that displays visual information on top of the glasses as you wear them. People close to Snap say that kind of technology is part of the company's future roadmap, but it's a long way off. Instead, Spectacles are ultra-simple and designed to look like a quirky pair of Ray-Bans. They record 10-second clips of video that get sent straight to the Snapchat app. They only cost $130. This simplicity is very much by design, and it's why Snap CEO Evan Spiegel called Spectacles a "toy" when they were first announced.  Snap employees are terrified of Spectacles being perceived in the same kind of creepy, nerdy way that Google Glass was, according to someone familiar with their thinking. It's why that Spectacles light up around the camera while recording — to help people feel like they're not being constantly monitored. And it's why Spectacles are marketed like this: Snapchat And not like this: Glass Collective Snapchat is already beloved by young people. By selling Spectacles through bright yellow vending machines that pop up in one city for 24 hours and then disappear (like messages in the app), Snap is setting itself up its glasses as a cool, exclusive status symbol out of the gate. And by all indications the approach is working. While the glasses have so far only been on sale for in Venice Beach and Big Sur, early reviews are overwhelmingly positive. Pairs of Spectacles are reselling for thousands of dollars on eBay. People are frantically tweeting about where to find the next vending machine pop-up. It's still too early to tell if Spectacles will be a success, but they already have the cool factor that Glass never had. And as long as Robert Scoble doesn't wear them in the shower, they have a shot at staying cool. Chances are slim that I'll get a pair of @Spectacles. Which sucks when I've seen people walking away with multiples :/. pic.twitter.com/OyJl9ZVfFM — David McGreavy (@DominusNoctis) November 10, 2016 SEE ALSO: Everything you need to know about Snapchat's Spectacles glasses, including how to buy them NOW WATCH: A hacker reveals a simple way to come up with a strong password that's easy to remember Loading video...

Google traffic is lucrative – there’s no doubt about that. Often, the most effective way to attract targeted traffic is to make sure your site is optimized for Google searches. As you may have already learned, winning that targeted traffic is one of the top strategies for making money on the web. However (and this is a big however), depending solely on Google organic search is not a good business model. Google frequently issues algorithm updates. This can lead to webmasters/bloggers losing all their traffic overnight. You need to diversify the ways that you draw online users to your site. Sure, Google search is a big part of that process – but it isn’t the only way to do it. You can still rely on organic search, but don’t make yourself vulnerable to another algorithm update before you have time to optimize for it. In fact, Google just released another Penguin update on September 23rd. Penguin 4.0 is supposed to be the final update of its kind. That’s because the algorithm will now run in real time, which means it will actually be updating on a continuous basis. How this may affect websites across the board remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: Business owners need to grow without being entirely reliant on the traffic from Google search. This is the perfect time to revisit my previous post and explore more ways to grow without Google traffic. What Happened to Me in 2012 Penguin Updates I know firsthand how a business can be affected by an update to the Google algorithm complex. My site, WebHostingSecretRevealed.com, was hit badly during the Google Penguin update in 2012. This forced me to rework everything from scratch again on a new domain: WebHostingSecretRevealed.net. Since then, I have been experimenting with different ways to pull in targeted traffic outside organic search. You can read how Darren lost 80% of his traffic overnight and what he did about it here. In previous posts, I have talked about some of the tactics I’ve learned and used to build a Google-less approach to attracting blog traffic. In this post, we are going to dig wider and deeper for more Google-less traffic strategies. Tactic #1: Content Swap Previously, I’ve discussed how guest posting is the best way to build sustainable web traffic. This concept is still valid two years after I first talked about it. Here’s an example: I published a guest post on Blogging Wizard in April two years ago. The post somehow gained popularity, and Mari Smith tweeted about the post. This led to some new traffic and Twitter followers for me – not to mention building my authority in the niche. The trick, again, is to guest post at the right place – Google PageRank or Domain Authority is never my main concern. What we want is influential blogs with real readers who will read and engage with your content. Guest post to build web traffic and your personal brand – not for Google PageRank. Never underestimate how effective it is to reach out to peers and influencers. Getting the word out about your own blog is much easier to do when you can collaborate with other bloggers. At this point, you might be thinking “But wait – researching for the right blog and reaching out to the right bloggers for guest posting opportunities requires lots of work!” Well, what if we can speed up that process and write more (and eliminate a lot of that work)? This is when Content Swap becomes the best tactic to use – the one that will help you to get the most from your efforts. So, What Is Content Swap? The idea of Content Swap came from Ken Lyons of Measured SEM. While Ken was suggesting swapping guest posts to build links, it may also work as a great way to bring more traffic to your blog. Without Content Swap, you must reach out to each blog and ask for a guest posting opportunity. This can be a tedious and time-consuming task. When you employ Content Swap as a tactic, you are in the driver’s seat. Guest posting opportunities will come to you instead of you being forced to seek them out endlessly. All you need to do is select the sites that meet your specific quality thresholds: You determine such details as the amount of traffic that meets your needs, how many social media followers the site should have, and other relevant factors. Then, choose those blog sites that fit your criteria. Steps to take for getting started with Content Swap: Set up a proper “write for us” page on your blog. Explain clearly what types of guest bloggers you’re looking for (and make it clear that you want to swap content with them). Share the page on your social media pages and forum signatures to increase the chances of being seen. You can also promote the page on Facebook to a specific audience (namely, those who own blogs). Sit back and wait for guest posting requests. (Self-plug #1: If setting up a “Write for Us” page is too much for you, you can swap content with us at WHSR.) Tactic #2: Influencers Marketing Now that you know about the importance of exchanging content – and how much easier it is to do this by using the Content Swap method – you’ll still need to do some footwork while you wait for guest bloggers to respond to your “write for us” page. The kind of blogger outreach I’m talking about now involves targeting influencers. Doing this is a bit more time-intensive than placing a call-out to other bloggers on your own website. The time you invest in this strategy can yield repeated returns for you, however. It’s also a way to identify which bloggers might be the best to swap content with once those offers start coming to you. Start by identifying the influencers who are blogging about topics that are relevant to you. You can build a spreadsheet to keep track of them all. You’ll find a wealth of blogs on every imaginable topic at a site like Alltop, for one. Just enter a keyword in the search box on the Alltop home page. That should produce a page with several blogs and subtopics that you can browse. Once you find bloggers who seem like suitable choices as influencers, use an analytics tool to find out how much influence they have on social media. One analytics site I’ve had success with is Klout. What can you do once you find the influencers you want to contact? Invite them to be interviewed by you on your blog. Ask them to collaborate on blog posts. Suggest swapping blog posts with them – as well as swapping links to your respective sites. Real life examples – Making friends” is often under-rated in blogging world. Michael Pozdnev reached out to 63 industry leaders and wrote this incredibly long post. It was the fourth posts he published on his blog IWannaBeABlogger.cm and the post has obtained more than 2,000 social media shares and comments to date. All of these actions will help build traffic to your site, and you won’t need to worry about where you rank on results pages. Tactic #3: Pour Oil on the Fire You can look closely to your existing traffic for more ideas on how to grow it. Previously, I covered five different tactics: 1) Blog commenting 2) Freebies marketing 3) Crowd sourcing post 4) Creative social media marketing and 5) Leveraging Q&A platforms. Are you using any of these strategies? Did any of these work particularly well for your blog? Look into your Google Analytics and find out how these tactics have helped your blog to grow in the past. Figure what is serving you well, and double up your efforts on the tactics that work. A Real-Life Example – Pinterest In the first half of 2015, we noticed that posts focusing on mom bloggers were drawing a lot of Pinterest traffic. Thus, we built more topics for this demographic; we then hired a part-time Pinterest marketer to help us promote our posts on Pinterest. The results were a 160% increase in Pinterest referrals and 40% percent more newsletter signups from this traffic source. How do you like 160% more Pinterest traffic and 40% better signup rate? What you can do: Look into your Google Analytics, and examine your top 50 traffic sources (follow this search path): Dashboard > Acquisition > All Traffic > Source/Medium > Show rows: 50 – Can you see a particular type of traffic source that is working exceptionally well? Do you know why it works so well? Can you invest more money, time, or manpower in that source to make it better? Tactic #4: Building an Email List Darren recently talked about the importance of building an email list: “Turn a visit into a regular weekly reader and you are effectively getting 52 readers a year.” Darren started out with only 17 subscribers (four of those were his family members and himself). Today, he manages a list of 700,000 subscribers. Imagine the amount of traffic you could get from a list that size! Like Darren, you can build a list of loyal subscribers by converting one-time or occasional visitors into weekly followers. Here are a few tips: Make visitors want more Publish compelling content, so people who just happen upon your site will want to stay connected to it. Provide users with valuable information that they will want to access on an ongoing basis. Media rich content Back up that text with audio (such as podcasts) and visuals (such as colorful infographics and videos) to keep your visitors interested. Place an opt-in form in plain sight Make sure that your visitors see your opt-in form on every page of your website. They may not always want to sign up for your list on the first page they land on, but they might want to do it after browsing for a while. Don’t let them miss out on that opportunity – make it available in the sidebar of most of your pages (if not all of them). Give them an offer they can’t refuse If you want people to subscribe to your email list, offer them something in return (like an eBook when they register). Don’t stop at the initial registration offer Once you start building your list, keep the momentum going by offering your subscribers more content they can use. Send enticing content in your newsletters, such as monthly webinars or discounts on products. Tactic #5: Leveraging Facebook I don’t think you need me to tell you that it’s extremely naïve to ignore Facebook. (Fun fact: At last check, Darren posts 3 – 5 posts per day on Facebook.) Facebook and the Facebook-owned WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger are the most popular social networks worldwide. Facebook could actually send more traffic to your blog than Google. At least, that’s what’s happening with Parse.ly’s network of 400 digital publishers. Here are two very effective Facebook advertising tactics you can try: 1. Revive Old Post Carousel Ads Below is a carousel ad I did recently to promote my evergreen blogging tips. The ads cost less than 50 cents per click, and I am drawing hundreds of visits per week to my blog. When you are targeting the right audience, the advertising cost on Facebook is relatively cheap. When you consider how huge the impact can be, you almost can’t afford not to advertise this way. (Self-plug #2 – By the way I compile our best blogging tips in this page). You may also use carousel ads on Instagram, which Facebook bought a few years ago. By telling a story in this type of ad, you can compel viewers to learn more about your business. They may then click on the link that leads to your website. Now, you have just attracted traffic without depending on the Google organic search function to do it. Here’s another reason to create this type of ad to market your business: According to Digiday, carousel ads get 10 times the clicks of ordinary Facebook ads – and they drive 10 times the amount of traffic to the websites of their advertisers. That means that the ads are helping you to work smart instead of work hard, and they’re saving you some serious advertising dollars. 2. Influence the influencers: Ads targeting Facebook Page admin Do you have some handy tips or experiences to share with Facebook page administrators? Can you create some to target this group of people? The idea here is to influence the influencers. If you market something effectively to Facebook page admins – be it a post or a product – you can get far more traction from your campaign than if you were to just target ordinary users. Why is this? Because a Facebook page admin has the “power of publisher”. Page admins usually have a group of followers themselves. If you manage to win them over, they could help you to amplify your message. Do you see how much more efficient this is as a marketing technique than conventional methods that have been used by everyone? Here’s how you can target Facebook page admins (follow this search path): Facebook Ad Manager > Power Editor > Create Saved Audience > Detailed Targeting > Digital Activities > Facebook Page Admins This is just the beginning… As mentioned in my previous article, appealing to web traffic is only part of the game. You Will Also Need to Focus On… Conversion Once you get people to your website, you’ll then need to turn those visits into conversions. You must optimize your landing pages to turn site visits into leads and leads into sales. Make the pages easy to navigate, so visitors can quickly move on from them when they want to explore your website. Run A/B testing and analytics so that you can improve the aspects of your landing pages that are not keeping people on your site. Creating opportunities to remarket By collecting emails via your opt-in forms, you can reach out to the site visitors that you didn’t convert the first time. Remarketing also enables you to maintain long-term customer relationships; you can make repeated sales to those customers; and ultimately, that is one of the best ways to keep growing your brand. As a blogger, you need to optimize your content in order to get targeted traffic. This absolutely includes optimization for Google search results. However, building an audience involves a lot more than getting traffic from organic search. Don’t leave your blog vulnerable the way that mine was a few years ago. SEO is only one strategy among several that can help you achieve your blogging goals. By swapping content, reaching out to influencers, developing an email list, and taking advantage of the tools on Facebook, you can draw targeted traffic and grow your blog.

Not only is glass more fragile than metal, the glass Google used on the back isn’t as strong as the front glass, making the entire back panel prone to scratches. You’d think that as long as you’re not laying the phone down on concrete, this wouldn’t be an issue but — throughout the course of our Pixel’s life and laying it on various wood surfaces, dinning tables, etc. — you’ll find that fine scratches quickly start adding up. You may remember not too long ago when another glass-backed Google flagship was released — the Nexus 4 — and users quickly discovered how fragile having a thin sheet of glass covering the back really was. Aside from small drops, even quick changes in temperature were causing the back to crack, forcing Google to release slightly revised models with little bumper tabs on the back. It was such an easy solution, I thought it be great to do something similar with the Pixel. Of course buying a case is an easy option for some, but there are those who prefer using their device completely naked, feeling the cold aluminum and every curve of the phone the way the manufacturer intended. Lately, I’ve found myself falling into this camp. So, instead of using a bulky case just to protect the glass from scratches, I decided to try something I already had in my home: Puffy Paint. Optional: add dots on the bottom to elevate the metal back from hard surfaces as well It may sound crazy, but Puffy Paint — also known as 3D fabric paint — is thick enough that applying two little dots on the sides of the glass elevates it just enough that it never touches the surface of wherever you lay it down. It’s also strong enough that it wont come off easily when pulling it in and out of your pockets, but can still be cleanly removed with your fingernail. If you also don’t like the idea of the aluminum portion laying on hard surfaces, feel free to use dots on the bottom portion as well. Having little bumper tabs on the back of the Pixel is so obvious, we just don’t know why Google (or HTC, rather) didn’t think of it first. In either case, those that love using their phone naked (the phone, not the person) may want to considering trying this little trick. You can find Puffy Paint in various colors at Walmart for about $1 a bottle, or you can get a 6-pack on Amazon right here which includes all of the Pixel colors (white, black, and blue).

Relative to the root of mozilla-central, the sandbox exists at: security/sandbox The chromium sandbox is based on the chromium base libraries (Google's code) which are located at: security/sandbox/chromium/base There is also partial/shim code to get the base code compiling with our SDK build settings or to limit the base code by reducing dependencies at: security/sandbox/chromium-shim/base The chromium Windows sandbox itself (Google's code) is located at: security/sandbox/chromium/sandbox/win Processes Overview There are 2 processes when dealing with a sandboxed application: The broker: The parent process that starts sandboxed children The target: The child process that is sandboxed Both processes make use of the chromium sandbox library, but they make use of it indirectly through 2 libraries (Mozilla code). This indirect use of the library is due to header conflicts with the ipc layer where it has a different, much older, non compatible, copy of the chromium base library (bug 925471): For the broker, ./security/sandbox/win/src/sandboxbroker For the target, ./security/sandbox/win/src/sandboxtarget Build settings To disable building the sandbox completely build with this in your mozconfig: ac_add_options --disable-sandbox To disable just the content sandbox parts: ac_add_options --disable-content-sandbox Environment variables Disable content process sandbox MOZ_DISABLE_CONTENT_SANDBOX Disable media plugin sandbox MOZ_DISABLE_GMP_SANDBOX Disable NPAPI process sandbox MOZ_DISABLE_NPAPI_SANDBOX Allow weaker than default sandbox level MOZ_ALLOW_WEAKER_SANDBOX Enable sandbox logging MOZ_WIN_SANDBOX_LOGGING Key source code locations The sandboxed target process lowers its own privileges after initialization via these calls: Content process GMP process NPAPI process Level descriptions header: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/security/sandbox/chromium/sandbox/win/src/security_level.h The call that starts the sandboxed process in Firefox is: https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/918df3a0bc1c/ipc/glue/GeckoChildProcessHost.cpp#1030 All of the code that sets policies can be found here: http://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/security/sandbox/win/src/sandboxbroker/sandboxBroker.cpp OSX The OSX sandbox is based on the TrustedBSD MAC Framework. It is undocumented and considered private by Apple. Mozilla OSX Sandbox Ruleset wiki page OSX Sandbox OSX sandbox policy language Linux Seccomp stands for secure computing mode. It's a simple sandboxing tool in the Linux kernel, available since Linux version 2.6.12. When enabling seccomp, the process enters a "secure mode" where a very small number of system calls are available (exit(), read(), write(), sigreturn()). Writing code to work in this environment is difficult; for example, dynamic memory allocation (using brk() or mmap(), either directly or to implement malloc()) is not possible. Seccomp-BPF is a more recent extension to seccomp, which allows filtering system calls with BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) programs. Most of our Linux user base have systems that support seccomp-bpf. These filters can be used to allow or deny an arbitrary set of system calls, as well as filter on system call arguments (numeric values only; pointer arguments can't be dereferenced). Additionally, instead of simply terminating the process, the filter can raise a signal, which allows the signal handler to simulate the effect of a disallowed system call (or simply gather more information on the failure for debugging purposes). Seccomp-bpf is available since Linux version 3.5 and is usable on the ARM architecture since Linux version 3.10. Several backports are available for earlier kernel versions. For limitations that apply to the semantics of system calls (e.g., “can this process access the filesystem”, not “can this process use system call #83”) we require unprivileged user namespaces, which a large majority of desktop users don't support. Specifically: chroot()ing into a deleted directory to revoke FS access, and namespace unsharing for networking, SysV IPC if possible, and process IDs. seccomp-bpf filtering rules for various processes Environment variables Enable sandbox logging MOZ_SANDBOX_VERBOSE Bug Lists Milestones Windows Content Process sbwc1 Roll out level 1 sandbox policy to release.

Under that, Google lists some related news articles. At the top this morning, with an accompanying photo: a story arguing that Donald Trump won both the popular and electoral votes. That’s not true. The Daily Show’s Dan Amira noticed that numbers were being spread on social media that linked back to the “70 News” site. The 70 News article cites its source as a tweet, which cites as its source USASupreme.com, another random website which doesn’t actually include the numbers themselves. It does, however, argue that Hillary Clinton is “probably not going to win the actual number of votes cast. She may win the number of votes counted, but not the votes cast.” That distinction is … not really clear, except that the author, “Alex,” seems to believe that absentee ballots are only counted if the tally could make the difference in the election. Related Articles November 15, 2016 Mexico weighs grim prospect of deportation wave under Trump November 15, 2016 Report warns of Asia arms race if Trump withdraws U.S. forces November 15, 2016 Trump victory could imperil Roe v. Wade abortion ruling November 15, 2016 People donating to Planned Parenthood in Mike Pence’s name November 14, 2016 SEC chair to step down, clearing path for Trump to eliminate tough Wall Street regulations That’s not true, either. In light gray text above the link to 70 News, Google relays the actual current tally of counted votes: Clinton has a lead of about 700,000. That lead has grown since Election Day and will almost certainly continue to grow, since millions of the votes being counted are from California, and the plurality of those votes are from very-Clinton-friendly Los Angeles County. The source behind the “USA Supreme” website isn’t clear. It looks an awful lot like Prntly, a made-up news website we looked at earlier this year. Founded by a former convict named Alex Portelli, Prntly is part of the broad diaspora of websites that takes news about American politics, frames it in a pro-Trump way (often at the expense of accuracy) and then peppers the page with ads. In an email, Portelli denied involvement in USA Supreme, suggesting that it was the work of a group of young people in Macedonia first reported by BuzzFeed. These sites leverage the inability of Facebook and other social media sites to weed out nonsense in order to get clicks and make money from advertising — a remarkably lucrative endeavor, particularly in a country where the U.S. dollar stretches a lot further. Why Google includes 70 News as a news source isn’t clear. Among the main categories of news stories the site lists in its header is “Hillary’s Health,” which links to a number of rumors about the health of the Democratic nominee. Under “Politics” is a story that, among other things, links the Council on American-Islamic Relations to Al Qaeda. Another story suggests that protestors against Trump in California were being paid to do so. 70 News has added a header to its post about the election results. “Anyone asking where I got the figures, it was from twitter posts. Knowing the Democrat media have been dragging their liberal feet giving Michigan to Trump – finally they did, with Arizona finally declared two days ago – Trump now has the 309. Except for the twitter posts, the popular vote number still need to be updated in Wikipedia or MSM media – which may take another few days because the liberals are still reeling and recovering from Trump-shock victory. If I’m wrong, I won’t hesitate to change the numbers. It’s the job of the establishment media to tell the people the final numbers when it’s out there already.” None of that is true, either. The “establishment media” has regularly updated election results, showing Clinton with a wide popular vote lead. The reason that Michigan hasn’t been called is that Trump’s lead is 12,000 votes, and the results haven’t been finalized. New Hampshire also hasn’t been called for Clinton; her lead there is under 3,000 votes. “Alex” is wrong; he’s hesitating to change the numbers. If you’re interested in tracking the final vote tallies in the presidential race, you can simply search Google and keep an eye out for the small print under the electoral college totals. If you also see an article from a random site you’ve never heard of? I might recommend you take its numbers with a grain of salt.

Submit Your Site HomeScottsboro Trials, Google Daydream View, Snapchat, More: Thursday Afternoon Buzz, November 10, 2016 Scottsboro Trials, Google Daydream View, Snapchat, More: Thursday Afternoon Buzz, November 10, 2016 November 10, 2016November 10, 2016 ResearchBuzz afternoonbuzz NEW RESOURCES The University of Alabama has launched a new online archive about the Scottsboro trials. “In 1931, nine African American teenagers were accused of raping two White women on a train. The defendants were apprehended in Alabama and were tried, convicted, and sentenced to death in Scottsboro, Alabama. The case was appealed and dragged on for many years. During the appeals processes, one of the women who had claimed to have been raped recanted her story and said she had never been touched by the defendants. However, the guilty verdicts were upheld.” TWEAKS AND UPDATES Google Daydream View is now available. “From seeing a dinosaur come back to life, to traveling to the farthest reaches of Pluto, to saving a runaway goat from dangerous traps, Daydream brings you on immersive virtual reality adventures powered by a smartphone. And now you can experience it all with Daydream View, a VR headset and controller made by Google available in stores today…” You know, I really need to get into Snapchat. But I’m terrible at it. I have nobody to snap with. Snapchat lets you surround yourself with confetti, clouds and butterflies. “The chat and entertainment app’s latest updates includes new effects that overlay virtual objects in photos and videos. Golden butterflies flutter around a room, or clouds with faces float overhead. An airhorn hovers in the image, and when pressed on the screen, unleashes a blaring sound and showers confetti.” More Instagram updates. From TechCrunch: Instagram will now let creators add URL links, tag friends, and create Boomerangs in Stories. “Starting today the company will let creators add URL links to their stories that viewers can navigate to without leaving Instagram, add the ability for users to be ‘@ mentioned’ in someone’s story, and add the ability to add a Boomerang to your story without having to go create one in the separate Boomerang app.” USEFUL STUFF I’m just trying to keep you hip (not really): Mannequin Challenge is the internet’s newest obsession. “Social media’s been rocked by a new trend that involves doing nothing whatsoever. Seriously. Well, not quite. The #MannequinChallenge requires groups of participants to assume a dramatic pose (could be anything) while hip hop duo Rae Sremmurd’s new song “Black Beatles” blares in the background.” AROUND THE SEARCH AND SOCIAL MEDIA WORLD Okayyyyyy: apparently Google tried to acquire Reddit in 2005? “Google attempted to acquire Reddit back in the site’s early days in 2005, cofounder Alexis Ohanian said at a press conference at Web Summit in Lisbon on Thursday.” This is probably supposed to be a marketing gimmick. Speaking as a consumer it comes off as irritating. But Snapchat is really good at making correct moves, so what do I know. CNET: You can buy Snapchat Spectacles today (if you’re lucky). “Forget preorders or waltzing into a Best Buy. Instead, you’ll need to hunt down a Snapbot, a vending machine just for selling Spectacles. It seems Snapchat has just one vending machine that will be journeying across the US, one spot at a time. You can expect the locations to be big cities or densely populated areas, like New York and Los Angeles, for example. The first stop is Santa Monica, California.” SECURITY/LEGAL ISSUES And it’s Sophos with the patch Tuesday roundup. “Microsoft’s latest Patch Tuesday is out, even if Redmond’s monthly updates haven’t officially been called ‘patches’ for more than two years now. There are 14 bulletins this time around, broken down in severity as follows…” Yikes! Apparently an iPhone bug can force iPhones to repeatedly dial 911. “Last month, we covered the arrest of a teenager who utilized a bug to spread a malicious link on Twitter that forced iPhones to repeatedly call 911. And now, we finally know how the bug actually works.” RESEARCH AND OPINION WECT: Friendly competition on social media may get you to the gym. “Social media can be a powerful motivating tool. But if your goal is to get to the gym more often, competition beats friendly support on social networking sites, a new study contends.” Good afternoon, Internet… Do you like ResearchBuzz?

(The Washington Post) By  The Washington Post The Times-Picayune Follow on Twitter on November 14, 2016 at 1:49 PM Print Email If you headed to Google to learn the final results of the presidential election Monday morning (Nov. 14), the search engine helpfully walked through the final electoral vote tallies and number of seats won by each party in the House and Senate. Under that, Google listed some related news articles. At the top Monday morning, with an accompanying photo: a story arguing that Donald Trump won both the popular and electoral votes.

Founded by a former convict named Alex Portelli, Prntly is part of the broad diaspora of websites that takes news about American politics, frames it in a pro-Trump way (often at the expense of accuracy) and then peppers the page with ads. In an email, Portelli denied involvement in USA Supreme, suggesting that it was the work of a group of young people in Macedonia first reported by BuzzFeed. These sites leverage the inability of Facebook and other social media sites to weed out nonsense in order to get clicks and make money from advertising -- a remarkably lucrative endeavor, particularly in a country where the U.S. dollar stretches a lot further. Why Google includes 70 News as a news source isn't clear. Among the main categories of news stories the site lists in its header is "Hillary's Health," which links to a number of rumors about the health of the Democratic nominee. Under "Politics" is a story that, among other things, links the Council on American-Islamic Relations to Al Qaeda. Another story suggests that protestors against Trump in California were being paid to do so. 70 News has added a header to its post about the election results. "Anyone asking where I got the figures, it was from twitter posts. Knowing the Democrat media have been dragging their liberal feet giving Michigan to Trump - finally they did, with Arizona finally declared two days ago - Trump now has the 309. Except for the twitter posts, the popular vote number still need to be updated in Wikipedia or MSM media - which may take another few days because the liberals are still reeling and recovering from Trump-shock victory. If I'm wrong, I won't hesitate to change the numbers. It's the job of the establishment media to tell the people the final numbers when it's out there already." None of that is true, either. The "establishment media" has regularly updated election results, showing Clinton with a wide popular vote lead. The reason that Michigan hasn't been called is that Trump's lead is 12,000 votes, and the results haven't been finalized. New Hampshire also hasn't been called for Clinton; her lead there is under 3,000 votes. "Alex" is wrong; he's hesitating to change the numbers. If you're interested in tracking the final vote tallies in the presidential race, you can simply search Google and keep an eye out for the small print under the electoral college totals. If you also see an article from a random site you've never heard of? I might recommend you take its numbers with a grain of salt. Philip Bump writes about politics for The Fix.

With this update, the service will use machine learning to present a user with personalized music recommendations based on “signals” such as their location, current activity and the weather. For instance, a selection of workout music may appear when a user walks into a gym. Google said users can opt in to receive these personalized recommendations. In addition, the app’s home screen has been updated to provide users with additional personalized content. In a blog post, Elias Roman, lead product manager of Google Play Music, explained: The new Google Play Music has a brand new home screen built just for you. Think of it as the ultimate personal DJ—one who listens not only to what you like, but also when you like it, so that the music that you care about now is always at the top of your screen. Maybe that’s your favorite new release on Friday, the dance party playlist you listen to after work or more music from a new artist you’ve just fallen in love with. Regardless, it will be there waiting for you to press play. Powered by Google’s machine learning systems and honed by our team of expert music curators, your experience will keep evolving (and improving) as we get to know you better. Finally, the app will now automatically prepare an offline playlist for Google Play Music subscribers so long as they charge their devices. Specifically, this offline playlist will contain tracks based on the music a user has recently listened to, and it will be available to them whenever they’re without a data connection. Google said this update will roll out globally on iOS, Android and the web this week. < Previous Article Next Article > Advertisement Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

The indications were that you would no longer need a compatible head unit in your car, instead, you would be able to use Android Auto with nothing more than your smartphone. It was unknown when Google was planning to release the new version of Android Auto, but it seems today is that day. The company has started sending out emails to everyone who signed up to be notified when the update would be released. This update allows anyone with an Android phone (running 5.0 or later) to use a driver friendly interface to access the key stuff you need on the road ― directions, music, communications ― without the distraction of things that aren’t essential while driving. Now that the app is available for download, we were able to take a quick look at what is being offered, and are pretty impressed so far. Being able to access Maps, your music app of choice, and the Phone conveniently is awesome and promises to help keep your eyes where they belong while driving. What’s even better is that there is a new collection of apps within the Play Store that allows you to view and download different apps. These apps are already updated with Android Auto support and include: Pandora Radio WhatsApp Messenger Kik Spotify Music Telegram Pocket Casts Hangouts WHAT’S NEW Android Auto now works with any car!

The incorrect results were shown Monday in a two-day-old story posted on the pro-Trump "70 News" site. A link to the site appeared at or near the top of Google's influential rankings of relevant news stories for searches on the final election results. Google acknowledged the problem, although as of mid-afternoon Monday, the link to "70 News" remained prominent in its results. FILE - In this March 23, 2010, file photo, the Google logo is seen at the Google headquarters in Brussels. Google's search engine is highlighting an inaccurate story claiming that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump won the popular vote in the Nov. 8, 2016, election, the latest example of bogus information spread by the internet's gatekeepers. (AP Photo/Virginia Mayo, File) Although Google rarely removes content from its search results, the company is taking steps to punish sites that manufacture falsehoods. In a move disclosed Monday, Google says it will prevent its lucrative digital ads from appearing on sites that "misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information." The action could give sites a bigger incentive to get things right or risk losing a valuable source of revenue. FAKE NEWS ON STEROIDS False information is nothing new on the internet, where debunkers have been batting down unfounded claims and urban legends for more than two decades. But the problem has gained more attention in the post-mortem of a bitterly contested presidential election in which Trump, a Republican billionaire and former reality TV star, defeated Hillary Clinton, a Democrat and former U.S. secretary of state who had been leading in the polls. Trump wound up prevailing in enough key states to win the Electoral College's decisive vote, but is trailing Clinton in the overall popular vote with some ballots still being counted. Clinton's lead in the popular vote has become one of the flashpoints in the protests against Trump's election being staged in cities across the country. Google is just the latest company in the crosshairs. Fake news stories uncritically circulated during and after the election on Facebook have sparked a debate over the role of social media companies, which are key sources of news for large numbers of people. Critics suggest that these companies should be more careful to ensure they aren't passing along misleading information. SOCIAL MEDIA AND THE NEWS Google's dominant search engine is the leading source of traffic to media sites, according to the online analytics firm Chartbeat. Meanwhile, a study by the Pew Research Center found about 60 percent of Americans get at least some of their news from social media sites such as Facebook, which now has 178 million users in the U.S. and Canada. In the election's aftermath, Facebook has been accused of possibly swaying the election's outcome by promoting fake news stories on its social network. Last summer, the company fired a handful of journalists who oversaw its "trending" news list and replaced them with an algorithm; fake news stories quickly began to trend. CEO Mark Zuckerberg brushed off that criticism as "crazy " in an appearance last week. He elaborated in a Saturday post on Facebook in which he asserted that "more than 99 percent of what people see" on Facebook is authentic. Zuckerberg conceded more needs to be done to block bogus information, but said that determining what's blatantly wrong isn't always an easy task. "Identifying the 'truth' is complicated," Zuckerberg wrote. "While some hoaxes can be completely debunked, a greater amount of content, including from mainstream sources, often gets the basic idea right but some details wrong or omitted." The stories featured in the feeds of Facebook users are primarily selected by automated formulas known as algorithms. Google's search results are also powered by algorithms that the company regularly revises to thwart sites that attempt to artificially boost their prominence. MORE, BETTER ALGORITHMS? Google conceded its search engine misfired with the 70 News story that falsely declared Trump the popular vote winner in both its headline and the body of the text. "In this case we clearly didn't get it right, but we are continually working to improve our algorithms," the company said in a statement. Bad information in an online headline or at the top of a story can be particularly damaging. Roughly 53 percent of the people who land on a web page stay for 15 seconds or less, according to Chartbeat's findings. Incorrect information is bound to ripple across the internet as more people rely on their phones, computers and other digital devices to read news that is picked out for them by automated programs, said media analyst Ken Doctor of Newsonomics. "What we are seeing is the failure of the algorithm," Doctor said. "These algorithms bring a lot of things into our lives that humans cannot do. But when algorithms fail, it highlights the fact that they are not just some kind of neutral technology. They are programmed by human beings and they have all the failings of human beings." It's difficult to know what happened when an algorithm goes awry because Google, Facebook and other internet companies closely guard how they work, much the way Coca-Cola protects the recipe for its soda. But the growing power that Google and Facebook hold over the flow of information could increase the political pressure for them to be held more accountable, Doctor said. In the meantime, most people remain skeptical about what they read online. Only 4 percent of Americans have a lot of confidence in what they read on social media sites, according to Pew. Local news organizations fared better in Pew Research's survey earlier this year, with 22 percent of Americans saying they trusted the information there.

It also announced there would be no Chrome ad blocker. Actively-used browsers aren't the same as active users, given that many users rely on Chrome on multiple devices, indeed one of the benefits of using Chrome is that it can easily sync between your devices. But however and wherever you look you'll quickly come to the same conclusion - Chrome has become the ubiquitous and dominant browser. On the desktop it has taken share from Microsoft's Internet Explorer and ensured that Edge has a failed to be adopted despite the efforts made in Windows 10. The fact Chrome is pre-installed on every phone running Google's version of Android certainly gives it a head start in the mobile arena and it also has a healthy share of iOS devices. Here's the latest position from StatCounter across PCs, mobile devices and consoles, showing that Chrome has a 51.53% share of the world-wide market   From NetMarketShare, the latest browser stats for smartphones, tablets and consoles are displayed in this pie chart which shows Chrome's share is 54.30%, with Safari having the only other significant slice (25.66%)   Turning attention to the desktop distribution, Chrome has almost the same proportion (54.41%) and it is Internet Explorer, which is the default browser for Windows 7, the dominant desktop OS that is is second place with 25.48%   NetMarketShare's trend chart over the last 12 months shows clearly how Chrome has increased its dominance at the expense of Internet Explorer: We used to comment on how Firebox was doing - but even though it has rallied a little from its low in August it does seem to have become a lost cause. It will be interesting to see if Edge, which is increasing its tiny share ever edges Firefox out of its third rank position. Meanwhile back at the Chrome Dev Summit, Darin Fisher, vice president of Chrome engineering, told delegates that Google will not be building an ad-blocking feature into Chrome, explaining that it's better to change the behavior of adds rather than block them altogether, a viewpoint undoubtedly motivated by the fact that Google makes a lot of revenue from advertising. Fisher said:  "We feel like there are a lot of challenges in advertising. There are a lot of wrong ways. However, if publishers and advertisers do ads the right way, it can be great for the users and for the ecosystem." Admitting that a lot of advertising hurts engagement by actually deterring people from using websites he referred to a recent initiative, the Coalition for Better Ads that Google has helped to found along with publishers like Facebook, News Corp. and The Washington Post, advertisers like Unilever and Proctor & Gamble, and industry groups like the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) and the Association of National Advertisers (ANA). Fisher also outlined Google's plans to to have Chrome support progressive web apps (PWAs) that deliver a mobile app-like experience within browsers:   "It's expensive to get people to install an app ... but progressive web apps arrive fast through the browser to keep visitors happy, then download extra abilities silently in the background. For website developers there's really no fundamental limit to the kinds of experiences you can create." Firefox and Edge also support PWAs but they are not yet supported by Apple either within Safari or for third-party browsers running on iOS. A lot of attention was paid during the summit to the need for websites to be mobile-friendly, particularly in view of the finding by StatCounter Global Stats that  mobile and tablet devices accounted for 51.3% of Internet usage worldwide in October compared to 48.7% by desktop.     Together with the fact that the Google search algorithm now penalizes web pages that are not mobile-friendly, this is a clear signal  to  web developers not to ignore mobile.        More Information StatCounter Global Stats Netmarketshare Coalition for Better Ads Related Articles Is Chrome Most Prevalent Browser?

This brings much more intelligence to the search giant’s music streaming service and grants users a new UI to gander at while interacting with either the Android, iOS, or web app. Starting with the new intelligence in Play Music, Google has built in the same kind of machine learning featured in their other products based on personalized recommendations. This means that based on your listening habits, Google will begin recommending songs, albums, artists, playlists, radio stations, and more right on the main page for quick access. You’ll also receive recommendations for music you like to listen to at certain times or at certain locations. Of course, recommendations have already been done before in Play Music, but this kind of machine learning is much more powerful. Therefore, Google will be able to predict songs and albums you may wanna listen to rather just suggesting them. The company explains this feature more in-depth below. To provide even richer music recommendations based on Google’s understanding of your world, we’ve plugged into the contextual tools that power Google products. When you opt in, we’ll deliver personalized music based on where you are and why you are listening — relaxing at home, powering through at work, commuting, flying, exploring new cities, heading out on the town, and everything in between. Your workout music is front and center as you walk into the gym, a sunset soundtrack appears just as the sky goes pink, and tunes for focusing turn up at the library. In addition, alongside the new UI and search bar, Google has also built in a feature into the native Play Music apps where if you’re a subscriber to Play Music and plug in your phone, Google will download music for later based on songs and artists you’ve previously listened to. There’s no telling how accurate and useful this feature will be, but you may wanna turn it off anyway if you’re currently running out of space on your device. All in all, this is a great revitalization of Play Music. By implementing the tools discussed here, it looks like Google really does have a worthy competitor to Apple Music and Spotify who have been using machine learning for quite some time now. Whether this will be enough for subscribers to either switch from another service or simply choose Google over everyone else is beyond me, but time will eventually tell if the search giant can really make it in the music streaming business. You can download the free Play Music app for Android and iOS from the Play Store and App Store, respectively. The update will begin rolling out this week to all 62 countries where Play Music is available. You can also visit the official web player for the music streaming service here.

Jump to navigation You are here Home Revamped Google Play Music offers song suggestions based on location and more Submitted by Jennifer Nguyen on Mon, 11/14/2016 - 12:34 Google has revamped its music streaming service with a new contextually aware song recommendation service. The new Google Play Music utilizes "machine learning" to figure out what type of music you like, then mixes that music based on location, activity, and even the weather. The new song recommendation service is available through Google Play Music on the web or through its iOS and Android apps. Google says its revamped music service is "smarter, easier to use, and much more assistive" thanks to its contextual tools that powers most Google products. The Google Play Music app features a redesigned home screen that promises to deliver the right music for you current mood to the top of your display. The app selects the appropriate songs or playlist based on your past listening history. Google describes its new service as the "ultimate personal DJ" who not only knows your favorite type of music, but also knows when you want to listen to certain tracks. This includes suggesting your favorite after work playlist on your drive home, or queuing up that new artist you have just discovered. The app also now supplies subscribers with an offline playlist based on their previous listening history. This allows users to access their favorite songs even when they are stuck with an unreliable or no connection. Google Play Music version 3.14.1007 is available now as a free OTA update. The app is also available for free on the Apple App Store for new users. A paid subscription is required to access all of the app's advanced features. Google Play Music supports all devices running iOS 8.2 or later.

By Jason Cipriani | November 14, 2016 -- 15:39 GMT (07:39 PST) | Topic: Google Image: Google Google Play Music is about to creep you out. Google announced an updated iOS, Android, and website for its streaming music service on Nov. 14. The update is already available on the web and iOS, with the Android version expected to follow suit later in the day. Along with a fresh coat of paint, Google Play Music is now smarter. What's Hot on ZDNet Microsoft to replace security bulletin index with database-driven portal High performance computing (HPC): A look at what's next with TACC's Dan Stanzione If you want a MacBook Pro with a Touch Bar, you have to wait until Christmas Researchers claim quantum computing breakthrough, explain it using beer According to Google's announcement, the new Play Music service uses your location, activity, and local weather. It combines that information with curated playlists, then performs a few fancy calculations, and spits out personalized playlists. For example, over time, Play Music will learn when you're in an airport, or when you typically listen to a certain style of music, and it'll create a travel playlist when it detects you're at an airport. The same will occur when you're at home, at the office, and -- of course -- the gym. Tailoring a playlist based on the small nuances of each user's day has big potential to attract new users and keep current users, if Google can get it right. To show off Play Music's new brain, Google redesigned its home screen. When you launch the app or visit the website, you will now see a series of cards recommending new albums or playlists. Users can sign up for a free, ad-supported Google Play Music account. For those who want to ditch ads and gain the option to download music for offline listening, a Play Music account starts at $9.99 per month for an individual account or $14.99 a month for a family account.

Google Play Music gets prettier and more intelligent Engadget 1 day ago Matt Brian © Provided by Engadget It's long overdue but Google Play Music is getting a makeover. The search giant confirmed today that it is in the process of updating its Android, iOS and Web offerings with bright new UI that relies on machine learning to deliver what's relevant to you. Its AI-like algorithms will identify where you are and what you're doing, also factoring in things like the weather, to serve up playlists and track recommendations that you didn't know you wanted but capture your mood at the time. "When you opt in, we'll deliver personalized music based on where you are and why you are listening — relaxing at home, powering through at work, commuting, flying, exploring new cities, heading out on the town, and everything in between," Google says in a blog post. "Your workout music is front and center as you walk into the gym, a sunset soundtrack appears just as the sky goes pink, and tunes for focusing turn up at the library." Popular Searches Apple Inc AAPL ▲ 106.70 +0.99 +0.94% Microsoft Corp MSFT ▲ 58.93 +0.81 +1.39% Bank of America Corporation BAC ▼ 19.89 -0.19 -0.93% Cisco Systems Inc CSCO ▲ 31.73 +0.36 +1.15% Every time you refresh the new home screen, it will offer various playlists that have relevance to your past listening habits. Listen to new releases on Friday? Then it'll serve them up. The same goes for upbeat tunes just as you leave work or a collection of tracks from that new artist you've just discovered but haven't had time to catch up on. Google Play Music has also been given a useful feature that determines when you're without connectivity and automatically delivers an offline playlist based on what you've recently listened to. Play Music is another example of Google using machine learning to improve its services. For a number of years, the company has steadily improved its algorithms to identify, index and caption photos and more recently purge your Gmail inbox of spam. With Spotify pushing personalized playlists via its 'Just For You' weekly playlist (as well as Discover Weekly) and Apple highlighting its 'For You' section, Google is treading a similar path but can call upon years of experience to deliver a streaming service that it says is "smarter, easier to use, and much more assistive." The new features will roll out gradually this week in the 62 countries in which Play Music is available.

Now, the company wants to put some of that knowledge to use to improve music recommendations: Google relaunched its Google Play Music service with a focus on context-relevant content recommendations Monday. The new version will roll out to all users across Android, iOS and the web this week. “Google Play Music uses machine learning to figure out what music you like and then mixes in signals like location, activity, and the weather along with hand-picked playlists to personalize music for wherever you are and whenever you want tunes,” explained lead product manager Elias Roman in a blog post Monday. Users who opt into using Google data to power their music recommendations will get song suggestions based on the place they’re listening, their current activity and even the weather. “Your workout music is front and center as you walk into the gym, a sunset soundtrack appears just as the sky goes pink, and tunes for focusing turn up at the library,” Roman wrote. In addition to the new content recommendations, Google Play Music is also getting a new look, as well as improved offline listening: Instead of asking users to download their favorite albums beforehand, Google Play Music’s new mobile apps do this automatically based on past listening — a feature that’s similar to the way Pandora’s new $5 tier caches music for offline listening. Google has yet to release subscriber numbers for Google Play Music, but it’s widely assumed that the service trails more popular competitors like Spotify and Apple Music by a wide margin. That’s in part because there has been little to differentiate the service from its bigger competitors. Using context-relevant content recommendations could be a first step to more clearly define what Google Play Music is all about.

Under that, Google lists some related news articles. At the top this morning, with an accompanying photo: a story arguing that Donald Trump won both the popular and electoral votes. Photo by: THE WASHINGTON POST That’s not true. The Daily Show’s Dan Amira noticed that numbers were being spread on social media that linked back to the “70 News” site. The 70 News article cites its source as a tweet, which cites as its source USASupreme.com, another random website which doesn’t actually include the numbers themselves. It does, however, argue that Hillary Clinton is “probably not going to win the actual number of votes cast. She may win the number of votes counted, but not the votes cast.” That distinction is … not really clear, except that the author, “Alex,” seems to believe that absentee ballots are only counted if the tally could make the difference in the election. That’s not true, either. In light gray text above the link to 70 News, Google relays the actual current tally of counted votes: Clinton has a lead of about 700,000. That lead has grown since Election Day and will almost certainly continue to grow, since millions of the votes being counted are from California, and the plurality of those votes are from very-Clinton-friendly Los Angeles County. The source behind the “USA Supreme” website isn’t clear. It looks an awful lot like Prntly, a made-up news website we looked at earlier this year. Founded by a former convict named Alex Portelli, Prntly is part of the broad diaspora of websites that takes news about American politics, frames it in a pro-Trump way (often at the expense of accuracy) and then peppers the page with ads. In an email, Portelli denied involvement in USA Supreme, suggesting that it was the work of a group of young people in Macedonia first reported by BuzzFeed. These sites leverage the inability of Facebook and other social media sites to weed out nonsense in order to get clicks and make money from advertising — a remarkably lucrative endeavor, particularly in a country where the U.S. dollar stretches a lot further. Why Google includes 70 News as a news source isn’t clear. Among the main categories of news stories the site lists in its header is “Hillary’s Health,” which links to a number of rumors about the health of the Democratic nominee. Under “Politics” is a story that, among other things, links the Council on American-Islamic Relations to Al Qaeda. Another story suggests that protestors against Trump in California were being paid to do so. 70 News has added a header to its post about the election results. “Anyone asking where I got the figures, it was from twitter posts. Knowing the Democrat media have been dragging their liberal feet giving Michigan to Trump – finally they did, with Arizona finally declared two days ago – Trump now has the 309. Except for the twitter posts, the popular vote number still need to be updated in Wikipedia or MSM media – which may take another few days because the liberals are still reeling and recovering from Trump-shock victory. If I’m wrong, I won’t hesitate to change the numbers. It’s the job of the establishment media to tell the people the final numbers when it’s out there already.” None of that is true, either. The “establishment media” has regularly updated election results, showing Clinton with a wide popular vote lead. The reason that Michigan hasn’t been called is that Trump’s lead is 12,000 votes, and the results haven’t been finalized. New Hampshire also hasn’t been called for Clinton; her lead there is under 3,000 votes. “Alex” is wrong; he’s hesitating to change the numbers. If you’re interested in tracking the final vote tallies in the presidential race, you can simply search Google and keep an eye out for the small print under the electoral college totals. If you also see an article from a random site you’ve never heard of? I might recommend you take its numbers with a grain of salt.

CLOSE Home News Opinion Pulse Arts & Entertainment Sports Tuesday, November 15, 2016 About Advertising Business Directory Archive Support Us Home News Opinion Pulse Arts & Entertainment Sports Home A&E YouTube Heroes bring crowd-sourced censorship, controversial solution to objectionable content YouTube Heroes bring crowd-sourced censorship, controversial solution to objectionable content By Jacob Rossiter - November 14, 2016 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Across the landscape of the Internet, a handful of websites have grown to become synonymous with the medium to which they operate within. To “Google” something, for example, is a term that is now rooted in our collective lexicon. When one says he or she is going to “Wikipedia” a topic, everyone present knows exactly what that person means. YouTube is the same way. 4.95 billion videos are viewed every day on the website, while 300 hours are viewed per minute. With those numbers, Google has an incredibly daunting task of trying to retain some level of control when it comes to the content that is allowed on the website. The survival of the website is contingent on keeping advertisers happy. One can only imagine how difficult a task it must be to try to guarantee advertisers that the videos on the platform reflect the right kind of image to viewers. There have been a series of attempts in the past to try to censor the content that deserves to be removed from the site. It used to be that a viewer could flag a video for violating the website’s terms of service, and upon review of that claim the video would be removed and a strike would be placed on the channel. Once a channel was issued its third and final strike, it would be terminated from the website. Granted, if the uploader felt as though his or her video was unfairly flagged, that person had the power to dispute the claim, but for the duration of dispute process, monetization was shut off. A new program, “YouTube Heroes” is the latest in these efforts. “YouTube Heroes” is the name of an initiative designed to shift the job of monitoring and policing the website’s content to the users themselves. YouTube urges users to “become a YouTube hero” by signing up for a tiered system that bestows rewards and perks upon its participants for the work that they do. People who sign up for the program can gain points for adding subtitles and captions to videos, reporting negative content and sharing knowledge with others. Once a “hero” gains enough points, they are given the power to mass-flag videos. Since its announcement, this new initiative has received an overwhelmingly negative backlash. The announcement video alone has 912,392 dislikes and only 28,747 likes. That’s pretty bad for a website that entirely uses a like/dislike system to rate content. Comments below the video are disabled, so there is no way of knowing articulately how viewers feel, at least right away. So why do the numbers show idea of such a system so universally disliked? The most obvious and glaring problem is that it would suppress any opinion or ideology that differs from the one kept by the “hero” in question. The fact of the matter is that virtually every point of view is offensive to somebody. The parameters set for what constitutes “negative content” on the site are so vague and open-ended that anybody with a predisposed chip on his or her shoulder would be able to contribute to censoring content. There would be few restraints on this, and it even looks as if YouTube meant for this to happen. So often it seems as though we live in an outrage culture. The term “politically correct” has become a huge buzzphrase over the last couple of years. It’s a phrase thrown around quite a lot, to the point that it has arguably lost its original meaning and intent. The tensions and hysteria surrounding probably the most contentious presidential debate in recent memory have brought the concept of political correctness even further into the forefront of our national dialogue. Due to social media and the power it has given the public, people feel as though they can voice any level of distaste or outrage they feel, and thanks to technology their feelings reach a lot of people. Comedians are told they must apologize for a joke they made in a comedy club because someone left and posted it on FaceBook. A tweet sent out by a company has to be retracted because people feel as if it promotes some agenda other than their own. Because of this, the perception of millennials, even by millennials themselves, is that their generation is too sensitive and too coddled. Many view this “YouTube Heroes” idea as a reflection of that attitude. It remains to be seen whether the system actually works.

COURTESY ESTATELY Print Email Comment Tweet Posted: Monday, November 14, 2016 12:42 pm By Lori Stabile PBN Web Editor Twitter: @loristabile retail Finder.com: Rhode Islanders plan to spend $52 on Valentine’s Day gifts (Feb. 12, 2016) economic indicators WalletHub names best small cities in U.S., Warwick ranks highest in R.I. (Oct. 31, 2016) economic indicators R.I. drops to 42nd in ‘State of the States’ report (Oct. 26, 2016) PROVIDENCE – Curious what “how to” questions Rhode Islanders Google more than any other state? They may or may not surprise you: How to build an igloo, how to roll a joint, how to make money selling drugs and how to do screenshots on Macs and PCs. Courtesy of Estately, a real estate website, Americans now know what residents in the United States are Googling – and they run the gamut from the practical (Alabama – how to install laminate flooring and North Dakota – how to get a passport) to bizarre and well, unbelievable (Nevada – how to survive a zombie apocalypse and California – how to be invisible, how to teleport). “When Americans don’t know how to do something, they won’t rest until they’ve figured it out, usually through the power of Google searches,” wrote Estately, which said what it uncovered was both surprising and “extremely predictable.” <a href="http://adserver.pbn.com/servlet/click/zone?zid=1&pid=0&lookup=true&position=1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"> <img src="http://adserver.pbn.com/servlet/view/banner/image/zone?zid=1&pid=0&position=1" height="60" width="468" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Click Here!"> </a> It used Google Autocomplete to compile hundreds of common how-to questions Americans type into the Google search bar, then ran the searches through Google Trends to determine which state queried each of the selected phrases the most over the past five years. Estately said the phrases do not represent what each state Googles the most, rather what each state Googles more frequently than the other 49 states and the District of Columbia. Here are some highlights: Arizona: How to join the Illuminati? Arkansas: How to make money? Connecticut: How to be pretty? Delaware: How to get away with murder? Florida: How to change the world? How to get out of Florida? Georgia: How to make meth? Hawaii: How to be a ninja? Kansas: How to find Kansas? Massachusetts and Minnesota: How to quit your job? Mississippi: How to twerk? New Hampshire: How to tip cows? New Jersey: How to get ripped? How to stop Trump? Vermont: How to cook quinoa? (tie with Idaho) More “how to” questions from each state can be found at Estately.com.

Email Password Remember me Forgot password?     Log in with Facebook Log in with Twitter Log In news tech & science social media business entertainment life sports     Google now has its own fake news problem Listen | Print By James Walker     yesterday in Technology In the days after the Presidential election, Facebook was accused of aiding Trump by helping to spread false news. It has emerged that Google is also displaying fake headlines. The company is investigating an inaccurate report promoted in search. Users searching for "final election numbers" on Google could be in for a surprise. As first reported by Mediaite, Google's top source in the search results links to a WordPress blog called 70news. The poorly built site is unlikely to be what users are looking for but Google is currently promoting it above all else. The title of the article that makes it to Google's top spot ends with "Hey Change.org, scrap your loony petition now!" The article claims to provide the final election results, suggesting Trump won the popular vote by a margin of 700,000 votes. Clinton is currently leading by around 668,000, a figure that some think may rise to two million. Google promoting a fake news article to the top of its news results James Walker The 70news report cites "twitter posts" (no capitalisation) as the source of the figures. The author, writing in the first person, pledged "I won't hesitate to change the numbers" if it turns out the figures are wrong. The site said "It's the job of the establishment media to tell the people the final numbers when it's out there already." There isn't a lot to suggest 70news is an authentic news site deserving a place at the top of Google. It's using a free ".wordpress.com" domain, hasn't changed its icon and includes "Hillary's Health" amongst its primary navigation topics. Combined with its fake headlines, it seems unthinkable that the blog has made it to the very top of Google's news cards. Other reports on the website include a "politics" story linking the U.S. Council on American-Islamic Relations to terrorist group Al-Qaeda. 70news' article on the popular vote appears in other areas of Google's election coverage, including its new digital assistant Google Assistant. Searching for similar terms, including "final popular vote," delivers the same result. An unassuming user who doesn't frequently read news online could be convinced that 70news' coverage is genuine. Google presents its news box as a place to quickly find out what's happening in the headlines. People neither expect or want to see links to poorly written personal blogs that have little relevance to the news. The lack of any generally well-regarded sites in the top three results suggests Google's algorithm has had trouble prioritising the wealth of stories covering the U.S. election. The company has not yet commented on the placement of 70news' post within its news widget. It remains unclear why the site has been categorised as a reputable news provider, considering its inaccurate, opinionated nature. At the time of writing, the headline is still the top result when searching for the final result of the election, accompanied by stories about 70news' presence in Google News.

By Jack Wallen | November 14, 2016, 8:55 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: Jack Wallen If you have a Linux printer server, and you need to enable users to be able to print to your cloud-based printers, one easy method is to attach CUPS to a Google Account for use with Google Cloud Print. Great solution, right? But how do you pull that off? Must-Read Cloud Why there's no compelling use case for hybrid cloud Pokemon Go: How the cloud saved the smash hit game from collapse Switching clouds: What Spotify learned when it swapped AWS for Google's cloud Tech Pro Research: Cloud computing policy Someone in the Linux community has made it not only possible, but easy. Let me walk you through the steps of connecting your CUPS printer server to a Google Cloud Print account. I will be doing this on a Ubuntu 16.10 machine. The necessary software is available for Ubuntu as well as rpm-based distributions, Arch Linux, Gentoo, Portage ebuild, OS X, FreeBSD, and more. Installation The first thing you must do is install the necessary package. To do this, we must add a repository. Open your terminal window and issue the command: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:simon-cadman/niftyrepo Now, update apt with the command: sudo apt-get update Finally, install the software with the command: sudo apt-get install cupscloudprint Once the installation is ready, you can connect your server to the Google Cloud Print account. SEE: Securing Linux Policy (Tech Pro Research) Connecting to your account The developer of cupscloudprint has made this task incredibly simple. Go back to your terminal window and issue the command: sudo /usr/share/cloudprint-cups/setupcloudprint.py The first thing that will happen is you'll be prompted to enter the email address associated with the cloud account. Type that address and hit enter. Next you'll be given a link to copy and paste into your browser (Figure A). Figure A Copy and paste the provided link into the browser. If you haven't logged into your Google account from this browser, you'll be prompted for that information; otherwise, you'll be asked to Allow CUPS Cloud Print to manage your printers. Click Allow. You'll be given a code; copy that code and paste it into the terminal window at the Code From Google: prompt. The command will output the accounts you currently have configured for Cloud Print. If you're happy with that, type y and hit Enter. You'll be asked if you want to add all the printers associated with your account. Type y and hit Enter. Once the printers have been added, you'll be asked if you want to use a prefix for the printers. If you do, type y, hit Enter, and then enter the necessary prefix; otherwise, type n and hit Enter. Any printer you have associated with Google Cloud Print is now available to your Linux printer server. Quite painless, wouldn't you say? Extending your printer server What better way to extend your Linux printer server than to connect it to your Google Cloud Print account? With this setup, you can easily print to different locations (even in different states), so you don't have to expend the resources connecting printers to VPNs or other, costlier and complex, solutions.

The search giant has announced it is now rolling out an updated version of Google Play Music in all 62 countries where the platform is available, which is to say Canadians will be able to check out the new app sometime this week. Besides featuring a fresh new design, the app is the latest Google service to take advantage of the company’s work in machine learning. Each time the user launches the app, Google Play Music will populate the home screen with new playlists relevant to their music interests and what they’re currently doing. “When you opt in, we’ll deliver personalized music based on where you are and why you are listening — relaxing at home, powering through at work, commuting, flying, exploring new cities, heading out on the town, and everything in between,” says Elias Roman, lead product manager for Google Play Music. “Your workout music is front and center as you walk into the gym, a sunset soundtrack appears just as the sky goes pink, and tunes for focusing turn up at the library.” In launching this new playlist-focused version of Google Play Music, Google is playing catch-up to Spotify. Since launch, the latter’s Discover Weekly and Just For You playlists have become a major hit, and while they do have a machine learning component to them, Spotify has said multiple times that it is its human music experts that help make them special. It will be interesting to see if Google can do the same with just algorithms. Google Play Music is available on Android, iOS and desktop.

I had been doing this because Search Results at Google and at Bing have started showing off information about businesses and site that includes knowledge panel information and richer snippets. I thought it made sense to capture information that Google might be showing off that represented sites, and provide some recommendations that might help improve how those looked at what kind of information they contained. The presentation is: Knowledge Panels, Rich Snippets and Semantic Markup from Bill Slawski Knowledge panels may be enhanced because of a verified Google MyBusiness listing, a Wikipedia Entry, a Freebase Entry (now terminated by Google), a Wikidata Entry. This Google Developers page provides more details: https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/enhance-site Adding Markup vocabulary on your site can result in a knowledge panel showing links to social profiles for a business, as described here: https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/social-profile-links A knowledge panel based upon a Google MyBusiness listing can show off Reviews that people have submitted to Google+ for a site, “Reviews from the Web” from sources such as Facebook, Tripadvisor, Consumer Affairs, and others; and may also show off critical reviews. If there are enough reviews from Google+, the knowledge panel may also show off sentiment rich snippets from those reviews as well. Search results are a lot more colorful and richer these days, and Knowing how to make your business and site stand out may bring you more traffic and customers as you are represented better in search results.

Its nice to see the SERP are really improving like reviews, and structured menus are already included. Nice share. David says: 10/20/2016 at 11:44 pm Very interesting read Bill. Thank you for sharing the presentation. I’ve highlighted sitselinks and rich snippets in client reports before, but I’ve not gone to the depths that you’ve gone to. It’s given me more food for thought. That is for sure. Thanks again. jay key says: 10/21/2016 at 2:58 am Hi Bill, Very helpful suggestions that help in the optimizing website. Thank you for valuable suggestions. Bill Slawski says: 10/21/2016 at 7:59 am Hi Jay, You’re welcome. I’ve been enjoying reviewing how sitelinks, and knowledge panels and structured data impacts sites. It is an area that Google has been making a lot of changes to recently as well. It’s nice keeping an eye on these changes and addressing them. 🙂 Andy Kuiper says: 10/21/2016 at 12:57 pm I enjoyed the sessions… as always – thanks Bill 🙂 Bill Slawski says: 10/21/2016 at 4:15 pm Hi Andy, You’re welcome. Good to hear that you enjoyed the presentations. I should have given thanks to Carrie Hall who provided a lot of details on how local businesses get value from Knowledge panels, and who included some great tidbits of information about Schema. Andy Kuiper says: 10/21/2016 at 4:34 pm 🙂 Alnoor Verjee says: 10/22/2016 at 9:34 am Hi Bill, interesting information. I just wanted to ask you whether it’s ok to add star rating snippets from a google my business page onto a page you would like to rank so that it looks eye catching in the SERPS? So basically the page will have schema code showing the stars which will link to the GMB page. I’ve seen some websites do this but just wanted to ask whether you think it’s sustainable in the long-term? Richart Ruddie says: 10/22/2016 at 3:40 pm As always Bill excellent analysis and great presentation showing the evolution through the years. Why do you think Google killed Freebase and do you believe there is a ratio for the knowledge panel to start displaying review snippets? Suresh Kumar says: 10/23/2016 at 2:03 am Hello Suresh Here Thank you for posting this article i am enjoying to read it . Ya it’s sure sitelink, knowledge panels and structured data always impacts sites. Abir says: 10/23/2016 at 3:20 am Hi Bill! very informative post. I will use the suggestions discussing here for optimizing my new blog site.This post will be very helpful for the begaineer SEO worker who are new in this field. Keep posting this type of helpful post. With best wishes Abir Dutta Allen Farrish says: 10/23/2016 at 7:55 am Thanks for the always useful information. This is great information to help garage type SEO people like me. Bill Slawski says: 10/23/2016 at 3:35 pm Hi Allen There aren’t any official places for people to learn about SEO, so if we have opportunities to help each other learn new things, we should take them. Bill Slawski says: 10/23/2016 at 3:37 pm Hi Abir, Good hearing that you have learned some new things here for optimizing your site. I hope that others learn from it as well. I will keep trying to post helpful things. Bill Slawski says: 10/23/2016 at 3:41 pm Hi Suresh, Search Results have changed in the past few years; and I tried to focus upon newer features that I hadn’t seen much about in Site Audits that people have been writing about or that I’ve been doing, and tried to carry these features over to my audits and my presentation. Bill Slawski says: 10/23/2016 at 3:56 pm Hi Richard, Thank you. Freebase appears to have been replaced by a volunteer effort known as Wikidata. If you haven’t had a chance to see it or spend any time with it; it’s worth learning about. There does seem to be a required number of Google+ reviews before Google will start showing review snippets in a knowledge panel. It’s another of those things that have been changing over time. For a while, Google was showing 3 snippets in the knowledge panel for SEO by the Sea from 3 Reviews; and then they stopped. Then I got another review, and they started showing 3 snippets again. And then they stopped. I have seen one site with 7 reviews that shows 3 snippets. I’m not sure of the exact required threshold to start showing snippets, or if it will change, like it has for me in the past. Bill Slawski says: 10/23/2016 at 4:10 pm Hi Alnoor, I don’t think Google wants people to add schema markup to their pages that show reviews or ratings that were submitted to a Google+ page. Google will show numbers of ratings and rating scores from Google+ in a knowledge panel for that site, so they have already found a way to display that information. Some other options that might be worth considering are available through this site started in part by Mike Blumenthal: https://www.getfivestars.com/ Caroline Middlebrook says: 10/24/2016 at 2:45 am Thanks for posting the slides Bill, it’s a great presentation, and something I need to learn more about. AsthiJivak says: 10/24/2016 at 3:47 am Wonderful blog! I truly love how it’s easy on my eyes as well as the info are well written. I am wondering how I may be notified whenever a new post has been made. Bill Slawski says: 10/24/2016 at 1:36 pm Hi AsthiJivak, Thank you for your kind words. I do have an RSS feed that you can subscribe to, and that could provide notifications of new posts. Bill Slawski says: 10/24/2016 at 1:37 pm Hi Caroline, Happy to hear that you enjoyed my presentation. Madhushalini says: 10/25/2016 at 9:52 pm I am very grateful for this enlightening article. I am new to this issue, but for me it elucidated several questions. Congratulations on your knowledge on the subject. Thank you very much. Allen says: 10/26/2016 at 11:26 am One basic question. Should I put the sameas links on every page or just the home page? Bill Slawski says: 10/26/2016 at 12:38 pm Hi Allen, The developer’s page from Google that tells us about the sameas links to social profiles can be found here: https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/social-profile-links It doesn’t specify (though it probably should) that those links just need to be on one page. Putting them on your homepage should be sufficient, as opposed to all pages of the site. Aymen Loukil says: 10/30/2016 at 9:33 am Good slides about entities and Knowledge Graph Bill 😉 I have developed this website to query the KG API of Google : http://knowledge-graph.fr Bill Slawski says: 10/30/2016 at 10:18 am Hi Aymen, Thank you. I wanted to show people how I was including a look at entities and the knowledge graph in an audit. It has become a part of how I do audits now. I’ve seen a few people point me towards your website to show off knowledge graph results. I do like how it looks. Rocky Murasing says: 11/01/2016 at 12:04 am Hello Mr. Bill I see you have comprehensively put a huge info in such a short blog. This must be beneficial for website optimization. I appreciate your work. Dhaval Parmar says: 11/02/2016 at 1:47 am Hi Bill, interesting information. ashok says: 11/02/2016 at 3:29 am your article gave some good point to seo beginners thanks for sharing your knowledge… Mark says: 11/05/2016 at 8:50 am I would agree the snipet panels or search query info boxes are killing it. They are huge and always at the top of the searches. It’s a huge advantage for your SEO campaign. Thanks Bill, great content. Bill Slawski says: 11/05/2016 at 11:34 am Hi Mark, Thanks. We’ve been seeing people increasingly refer to those answer boxes at the top of search results as being in “Position zero.” It is a nice place to be, especially in mobile results. If you can capture people’s attention, and persuade them to come visit your pages at the start of a search, it is a matter of being at the right place, at the right time. Jeff says: 11/05/2016 at 3:40 pm Hi Bill, Thank you for valuable information and thank you for sharing knowledge. Bill Slawski says: 11/05/2016 at 9:05 pm Hi Jeff, You’re welcome. These do seem like moves that are worth learning about. jese says: 11/10/2016 at 9:44 pm So interesting article. And great tips in there. Thanks for sharing.

Strategy Analytics Nov 14, 2016, 12:00 ET Share this article BOSTON, Nov. 14, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- The increased reliance on mobile LBS continues to be fueled by mobility apps which enable taxi-hailing, car-sharing, and car-pooling, in addition to the integration of multimodal routing in popular mobile map applications like Apple Maps, Google Maps and HERE WeGo, according to Strategy Analytics' Wireless Media Strategies (WMS) report "Mobile LBS: Status Check & Platform Assessment." In emerging markets the growth of mobile LBS is being boosted by a growing penetration of GPS on lower priced handset tiers. Furthermore, for the third year running, location platform HERE has come top in Strategy Analytics' location platform benchmark study, and is placed well for future growth opportunities as the mobile location services market continues to evolve. Click here for the report:  http://sa-link.cc/MobileLBS Continue Reading Photo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20161114/438754 Rising adoption of smartphone-centric mobility apps, including Uber, Lyft, and Didi, among others, and the meteoric rise of the location-based augmented reality game, Pokémon Go, have provided a welcome boost to the mobile LBS sector during 2016. Nitesh Patel, Director, Strategy Analytics noted "Mobile location services are benefitting from the shift in demand for urban transport towards on-demand, mobile-centric services, where the smartphone plays an increasingly important role for both journey planning and the administration of these services. Ride-hailing and car-sharing will be further boosted by their integration into major mobile journey planning applications, such as Apple Maps, Google Maps and HERE WeGo, which are evolving into one-stop-shops for journey planning and support."   The report assesses the strengths and weaknesses of global LBS players, Apple, Google, HERE, and TomTom, across eight important metrics, including map and navigation coverage, indoor venue capabilities, reach across major mobile device platforms, map data visualization, in-vehicle connectivity, offline usage, local search and crowd sourcing. The race to provide the most fresh, up-to-date and accurate maps in real-time is being driven by a combination of the trend towards autonomous driving, and greater consumer dependence on smartphones for journey planning and execution in outdoor, and increasingly indoor environments. David Kerr, Senior Vice President at Strategy Analytics, noted "For the third year in the row HERE has maintained its leadership in mapping and location capabilities, followed by Google, TomTom and then Apple. HERE's ownership by car-makers enables it to leverage its strength in the automotive industry across all digital platforms, including mobile. Google maintains its leadership in business –to-consumer (B2C) LBS applications, as it benefits from preloading on most Android handsets, and is the most widely used map, navigation and local search app. Both Apple and TomTom remain in catch-up mode with TomTom aiming to improve its support of multi-modal routing and navigation, including ramping its coverage of indoor venues in 2017."

The new GPM leans heavily on machine learning to get a read on your musical likes, and then "mixes in signals like location, activity, and the weather" along with hand-curated playlists. Contextual tools that power and individualize other Google products are being utilized to help provide "richer" recommendations. "When you opt in, we’ll deliver personalized music based on where you are and why you are listening," said lead product manager Elias Roman on the Google blog. The new Google Play Music also creates offline playlists for you, based on your listening history, meaning there will always be tracks on your phone even if you lose cell service. A new home screen reflects on your listening habits as well, so if you’re someone who hits the gym most mornings, a workout playlist may appear. Ditto for users who religiously visit the app on Fridays for new music or who rock out on drives home from work. "Powered by Google's machine learning systems and honed by our team of expert music curators, your experience will keep evolving (and improving) as we get to know you better." Introducing a fresher take on music streaming —one that's smarter, easier to use, and much more assistive. https://t.co/CUODx4ZIMa pic.twitter.com/JHgCkp40Tb— Google Play Music (@GooglePlayMusic) November 14, 2016 FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Comments Magazine Customer Service Subscribe Buy this issue Billboard biz The online extension of Billboard Magazine, billboard.biz is the essential online destination for the music business.

Every time we type something into that thin white bar, it’s learning from us, and noting down what it learns for all of time to come. Sinister, yes – but also useful. Take, for example, the stereotypes of our fair isles. Have you ever wondered what the internet thinks of the people of Herefordshire, or what being from Cumbria really signifies for the www dot generation? Using the power of Google autocomplete, we’ve constructed a map out of the most popular related search terms for each county in the UK. Some of them are as you’d expect – others? Well, they can get a bit weird. You can see a more detailed breakdown of the results below – if it isn’t there, it means people probably aren’t searching it. The South Bedfordshire Most people are asking the age old questions: “Is Bedfordshire in London?”; “Is Luton safe?”; “Is Bedford happy?” Berkshire People talking about Berkshire seem to think Windsor is “in London,” Maidenhead is “a dump,” Hungerford is “flooded” and Eton is, perhaps unsurprisingly, “a posh one.” Buckinghamshire People of Buckinghamshire, rejoice: not only are you “posh,” you’re also “the best county” and – apperently – “the new Hollywood!” Beaconsfield isn’t so lucky, though – apparently it’s “jinxed.” Bristol “Bristol is open,” and Bristol is also “the new black.” You’re also “the green capital,” apparently, so good for you. Cambridgeshire Not that there’s a rivaly, but Cambridge is apparently “better than Oxford” – it’s “beautiful,” too. Cornwall People are confused by Cornwall, tending to ask Google “Why is it good for surfing?” and declaring that the county is “not England.” St Ives is apparently “bad for your skin,” while Newquay and Penzance are both “a dump.” Devon  The top search term for Devon is “better than Cornwall,” obviously. On a more local level, people declare Exeter “posh,” Torquay “rough” and “hilly” and Dartmoor as “dangerous” and “haunted.” Dorset  People most often describe Dorset as “beautiful,” although they spend as much time asking if it’s in Devon, Cornwall or Kent. Queries include asking if Bournemouth is “nice” or even “sandy,” if Weymouth is “dog friendly,” and if Gillingham is “safe,” “rough” or “in London.” Essex Essex takes a battering online: it’s “just crap,” according to one of the top search results. Frequantly asked questions include “Why is Essex so rich?”, “Why is Essex so famous?”, and “Why is Essex so bad?” Colchester is apparently “vulgar and debased,” but Billericay is “posh.” Gloucestershire Sorry to break it to you, but no-one searches for Gloucestershire – even the top results for Cheltenham and Cirencester tend to be the baffled “Where?” and “Which county?” Greater London Unsurprisingly, there’s a plethora of search terms for London. “Dirty” and “lonely” come out top, although people are also obsessed with it being “hot” and “humid” – and, of course, “expensive.” On a closer level, Shoreditch and Dalston are both “dead,” but Peckham is both “the new Shoreditch” and “the new Dalston.” The City of London is “not part of England,” West London is “wonderful” and, unfortunately, South London is “bad.” Hertfordshire “Posh.” Obviously. Did you need to ask? Isle of Wight It’s both “rockin” and “a ghetto,” so take of that what you will. Kent Blame Farage, but Kent is declared “racist.” And “boring.” Hey, at least Margate is “cool.” Norfolk “Inbred.” Oxfordshire Sure, it’s “posh,” but it’s also “overrated.” Oxford itself is an “expensive dump,” while Bicester is “cheap” and, apparently, “on fire.” Also, people really want to know when an Aldi is opening in didcot. Suffolk Hey, apparently Suffolk “is the best place to live.” You go guys. Surrey  All the Surrey stereotypes ring true online: “Conservative,” “posh,” “expensive” and… “dangerous”? Sussex “Split” is the most-searched term, meaning people are understandably confused what went wrong between the East and the West. The Midlands Derbyshire “Derbyshire is a hotbed of Satanism.” Herefordshire Most people are confused whether Herefordshire is in Wales or not. Is it!? Leicestershire Leicester is “on fire,” apparently, and not just because they were “top of the league.” People are also pretty obsessed with finding out whether it’s “East of Norwich,” strangely. Lincolnshire “So flat,” “so cheap,” and apparently so boring. Northamptonshire “Northampton is my fate,” declare the Google search terms. Nottinghamshire The top result is genuinely “Nottinghamshire is in which country?”, while the consensus around Nottingham itself is that it’s both “rough” and “the Queen of the Midlands.” Rutland “Where?” Shropshire Like Herefordshire, people just really want to know if it’s in Wales or not. Staffordshire “The creative county.” Now you know. Warwickshire “Which country is Warwickshire in?”; “Is Warwickshire a city?”; “Is Warwickshire near Birmingham?” – all questions the internet is dying to know the answer to. West Midlands Brummies are: “thick,” “brilliant,” “friendly” and, apparently, “the UK’s randiest.” Worcestershire Sorry to break it to you, but people only care about the sauce. The North Cheshire “Posh,” “affluent” and “wealthy.” Cumbria The weirdly specific search terms about Cumbria are that it’s “the safest place to live,” that it’s “wet,” and that it’s “good for windfarms.” Greater Manchester “Important.” Unlike Mancunians to blow their own horn. Lancashire Keeping the age-old rivalry alive, Lancashire is declared “better than Yorkshire.” It’s also “wonderful,” not to mention “famous.” Merseyside There’s a real dichotomy when it comes to Liverpool – half of the results declare it a “dump” full of “thieves,” while the other half say it’s “the pool of life” and “a great city.” Scousers? Well, apparently they’re “annoying” – we apologise on Google’s behalf. Northumberland “Is Northumberland in Scotland?” I guess we’ll never really know. Tyne and Wear Google isn’t kind to Geordies, either. Search “Geordies are,” and the first four results you’ll get are (in order): “thick,” “scum,” “Scottish” and (luckily) “the best.” Yorkshire Yorkshire is “big,” so it’s no surprising it heralds a lot of results. These include “a state of mind,” “God’s own country” and “the best.” Bradford is apparently “very inbred,” though, and if you type “we all hate” into the whole of Google the first result you’ll get is “Leeds scum.” Charming. Scotland Autocompleted Google results are actually much sparser in Scotland, mainly because most of them finish with either “is in Scotland,” “is in the Highlands,” or “is where?” – much like with Dumfries & Gallowayand Kincardineshire. However there are some more quirky queries online: Aberdeenshire is a “paradise” and Ayrshire is a “nice place,” while Stirlingshire is “important” and Banffshire is “expensive.” Up top, things get a little bit more confusing. People seem to only associate Moray with its slippery namesake, while questions ask range from “Is Bute a Scrabble word?” to “Are The Highlands dangerous?” And “Is Orkney the new Ibiza?”, obviously. Wales and Northern Ireland Wales and Northern Ireland are both defined online by general confusion. In the latter, they ask if Pembrokeshire is “nice,” if Powys is a city, is Caernarvonshire and Merioneth are “haunted” and if Montgomeryshire is even in Wales after all. The search terms to do with the cities are a bit clearer, though, if not a little mismatched: Cardiff is “booming,” while Swansea is “the graveyard of ambition.” Over the sea in NI, most of the questions are about whether places are in the UK or not – although there are a few exceptions. Fermanagh, for example, is “happy;” Derry/Londonderry may or may not be “safe.” Antrim? Well, that’s the name of someone’s stepdad. @thebobpalmer Share on Facebook The UK’s worst hometowns, according to Google The most heartbreaking tweets from women who can’t believe Trump is president Here’s the best dressed people on campus this week The 10 jobs with the biggest bonuses No, that Simpsons picture didn’t predict Trump’s presidency Who actually is Melania Trump?

Google’s self-driving cars are naturals when it comes to three-point turns Posted yesterday by Darrell Etherington (@etherington) 0 SHARES Next Story Lima beefs up its Dropbox alternative with the $129 Lima Ultra Google updates the world monthly on the progress of its self-driving car project, and this month’s update includes the usual stats, like over 2,230,175 miles driven in autonomous mode, as well as an explainer on how the cars handle a tricky task: multi-point turning. The three-point turn is a boilerplate part of any driving test, and one that can prove quite challenging depending on where you’re trying to accomplish one. Google says that its cars have some big advantages over humans when it comes to multi-point turns, like full 360-degree wraparound vision, and extremely accurate distance measurement. As a result, Google has found that its cars could actually do maneuvers that don’t resemble the standard three-point turn but that might be more efficient overall – but that’s not ideal UX when it comes to human passengers. Humans are more comfortable when cars drive in ways that include recognizable behavior, so Google has trained its self-driving fleet not only to execute three-point turns, but to do so in a way that “feels natural” to those on board. The Google test cars do around 1,000 multi-point turns on actual city roads per week, Google says. Google also uses the report to spell out any accidents its test cars are involved in, and they did have one to report from October 26. The self-driving car was traveling at 3 mph when it was tapped from behind by a vehicle going 6 mph, however, making it a minor fender-bender where the human was at fault and damage was minimal. It’s interesting to get a look at how the Google team is building UX into their tech, at the same time as they’re solving difficult technical challenges. Good UX will probably be just as important to long-term user acceptance of autonomous driving tech as will safety issues, so it’s smart to build them hand-in-hand. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Newsletter Subscriptions The Daily Crunch Get the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inbox TC Weekly Roundup Get a weekly recap of the biggest tech stories Crunchbase Daily The latest startup funding announcements Enter Address Subscribe Latest Crunch Report Snapchat Starts Selling Spectacles | Crunch Report Watch More Episodes Artificial Intelligence Popular Posts Featured Stories Microsoft teams up with Elon Musk’s OpenAI project 3 hours ago | Frederic Lardinois Google and Facebook ban fake news sites from their advertising networks 5 hours ago | Romain Dillet WhatsApp launches video calling for everyone 11 hours ago | Josh Constine, Sarah Perez Valuation metrics show weakening for the fourth straight quarter 17 hours ago | Connie Loizos Latest From Gadgets The cameras are coming 13 minutes ago | John Mannes New LIDAR package makes it easier to add smarts to your smart car 1 hour ago | John Biggs Jaguar’s first electric SUV aims for 80% charge in 90 minutes 2 hours ago | Darrell Etherington John Hancock insurance is subsidizing the cost of the new Apple Watch 3 hours ago | Brian Heater Comment moderation powered by Up Next Lima beefs up its Dropbox alternative with the $129 Lima Ultra Posted yesterday CrunchBoard Job Listings Infrastructure Engineer Tango at The Sourcery (Mountain View, CA, United States) Senior Software Engineer @ Pared at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) Software Engineer @ Pared at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) Technical Content Writer @ Pantheon at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) Staff Software Engineer @ Lending Home at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) More from CrunchBoard Advertisement TechCrunch News Video Events Crunchbase TechCrunch Store About Staff Contact Us Advertise With Us Send Us A Tip International China Europe Japan Follow TechCrunch Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Youtube Pinterest Tumblr Instagram StumbleUpon Feed TechCrunch Apps iOS Android Windows 8 Subscribe to The Daily Crunch Latest headlines delivered to you daily Subscribe to <span class="no-mobile">Subscribe to </span>The Daily Crunch Enter Email Address Subscribe © 2013-2016 AOL Inc.

Columnist Sherry Bonelli shares insights from BrightLocal's annual Local Consumer Review Survey. Sherry Bonelli on November 14, 2016 at 10:03 am More A business’s online reputation is more important than ever. In fact, a company’s online reputation is fast becoming one of their most valuable assets — if managed properly. Why? In a world where online reviews show up virtually every time a person searches for a local business, potential customers can’t help but be confronted with reviews about a local business’s products or services — the good, the bad and (sometimes) the downright ugly. So what impact do these reviews have on people searching for a place to spend their money? BrightLocal’s 2016 Local Consumer Review Survey Every year, BrightLocal (disclosure: my employer) surveys everyday consumers to gauge the sentiment and attitudes they have about the local companies they do business with. The purpose of the survey? To help small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs), digital marketing agencies and SEOs understand how online reviews influence the purchasing decisions consumers make as they search for local companies, products or services. If you (or your clients) have been avoiding the topic of online reviews up until now, I have a feeling you will change your mind after you learn more about how consumers read and act (or don’t act) after evaluating online reviews about businesses. About the 2016 Local Consumer Review Survey The Local Consumer Review Survey is in its sixth year. Over the past several years, there has been a noticeable shift in how consumers search online for local businesses and the importance online reviews play in a consumer’s purchasing process. This year BrightLocal surveyed a US consumer panel made up of 1,000 individuals. The survey questions explore how consumers read and use the reviews they see online. The answers show how businesses and marketers can qualify the value consumers put on online reviews and whether these reviews have any impact on a consumer’s purchasing decisions. Consumers see online reviews almost every time they search More and more these days, consumers are using the internet to find local businesses and see online reviews almost every time they go online to do a local search. Why the increase? Over the past few years, many local businesses have realized the importance of optimizing their online presence for the local market by claiming their Google My Business or Bing Places for Business pages, creating location-specific pages on their website, adding Google Maps to their site and other local SEO strategies. Additionally, Google shows online reviews in many search engine results pages (SERPs), and they even recently started adding third-party review sites and reviews to a business’s Knowledge Panel. Also, because people have access to a variety of devices to perform searches on, such as smartphones and tablets, it’s easy for them to jump online wherever they are and search for reviews about a business, product or service. So, how do consumers read and use the information found in reviews? Let’s find out by looking at some of the survey questions and answers. Which of these business types have you read online reviews for? Note: Respondents were told to select as many answers as needed. Key findings: The most commonly read reviews by consumers are Restaurant/Cafe reviews, with 60 percent of respondents having read reviews for businesses in this category. Hotels/Bed & Breakfasts reviews came in second, with 40 percent of respondents seeking reviews for businesses in this category. Also popular are Medical/Healthcare Professionals, Clothing Shops, Hair/Beauty Salons, Automotive Services and Grocery Stores. Restaurants/Cafes, Hotels/Bed & Breakfasts, Medical/Healthcare Professionals, Clothing Stores, Hair/Beauty Salons, Grocery Stores and Automotive Services are the main businesses that people want to read reviews for. One thing to consider is that these numbers are somewhat dependent on both the type of business and how frequently consumers tend to use that type of business. For instance, business types that people use frequently (like restaurants or grocery stores) will probably have more reviews because more people simply visit these types of businesses more often and on a regular basis. You will probably find fewer reviews for locksmiths, accountants or pest control companies because these services are not needed as often. Even though reviews for some business types are read less often, when one needs those businesses (e.g., you lock yourself out of your house or you see cockroaches in your kitchen), then consumers will actively look at those reviews. Bottom line: every business benefits from having online reviews (no matter the industry). How many online reviews do you read before you feel you can trust a business? Key findings: 90 percent of consumers read just 10 reviews or fewer before they feel that they can trust a business (vs. 87 percent in 2015). 32 percent of consumers form an opinion by reading one to three reviews. 68 percent of consumers form an opinion by reading one to six reviews. Consumers form opinions about a business fast, with 68 percent forming an opinion by reading just one to six reviews. Almost nine out of 10 consumers determine whether they can trust a business after reading 10 or fewer online reviews. To remain relevant, businesses must have a reputation strategy where they monitor what consumers are saying about them and have a way to proactively get positive new reviews from happy customers. Why? When evaluating a business, consumers will typically look at the top reviews first. If the recent reviews are negative ones, they may not read past those bad reviews — even if there are positive reviews right below the negative ones. It’s imperative that businesses generate ongoing positive reviews so that any negative reviews they have are pushed down on the list. Business owners shouldn’t be scared of online reviews, they should see them as an opportunity to engage with their customers and get feedback about their business. How many different review sites (e.g., Yelp, TripAdvisor) do you look at before you make a decision about a business? Key findings: 20 percent of consumers look at one review site before deciding. 59 percent of consumers look at two to three review sites before making a decision. 21 percent of consumers look at four or more review sites before deciding. This new question focuses specifically on how many review sites people go to before they decide about a business. The answers vary depending on the type of business someone is researching. For instance, if they’re looking for a restaurant, they might only check one or two review sites. But if they are going to purchase a new car and the financial stakes are higher, they will probably look at more review sites. When judging a local business on its reviews, which of these factors do you pay most attention to? Note: Respondents were told to select a maximum of two answers. Key findings: 58 percent of consumers put the highest weight on the overall star rating. The second most important factor is “sentiment of reviews.” The recency of reviews is also important, coming in third at 41 percent. When evaluating online reviews, the most important factor to consumers is how many stars a business has. Star ratings are a very quick and visual guide to show how trustworthy a business is. But there are other factors that people consider to get a holistic view of a business’s reputation. Other factors are the sentiment of reviews (i.e., positive or negative comments and statements) and the recency (aka age) of reviews. As an example, if a business has three five-star reviews, but the reviews are two years old, the consumer will probably devalue the importance of the star rating because they really want to see more recent reviews. When selecting a local business to use, what is the minimum star rating a business must have for you to use them? Key findings: 87 percent of people want to see three- to five-star reviews about a business before they will consider using them. Of the consumers surveyed, only 14 percent would consider using a business with a one- or two-star rating. For consumers, star ratings are considered the most important factor in deciding which local business to use. For instance, 56 percent of consumers won’t consider using a business with just one to three stars; in other words, if a business has less than a four-star rating, that company is losing out on 56 percent of potential customers. Notably, while consumers consider star ratings to be an important decision-making factor, they are also realistic — only 8 percent expect a business to have a five-star rating before they will consider using them. How do online customer reviews influence your decision to actually use a local business? Note: Respondents could select more than one answer, so these numbers cannot be directly compared to 2015 results. Key findings: 68 percent of people say positive customer reviews make them more likely to use a local business. 12 percent of consumers say that they read reviews, but those reviews don’t influence their decision on which local business to use. 42 percent say that negative reviews make them not want to use a local business. Almost 70 percent of consumers said that positive reviews make them more likely to use a local business. Additionally, 42 percent of consumers say that negative reviews make them not want to use a business. These numbers show that people seriously consider reviews when making a purchasing decision. Do you trust online customer reviews as much as personal recommendations? Key findings: 83 percent of people trust online reviews as much as a personal recommendation — if they meet their requirements (vs. 80 percent in 2015). Just 16 percent of consumers surveyed said that they don’t trust online reviews (vs. 20 percent in 2015). Authenticity is essential — over a quarter of consumers trust reviews more than personal recommendations only if they believe the review to be genuine. People trust reviews now more than ever, but a portion of consumers are concerned about fake reviews: 27 percent of people will trust reviews if they think they are authentic (31 percent in 2015). If consumers think that a review is “planted” or “seems too good to be true,” they will take that into consideration. Fake reviews, and the effect they have on eroding consumer trust, have become hot topics as of late. As this topic gets more media coverage, consumers become more aware of the pitfalls of online reviews. When you read positive reviews for a business, what is the typical next step you take? Key findings: After reading positive reviews, 54 percent of consumers will visit the business’s website (48 percent in 2015). 19 percent will visit the business directly. 17 percent will search for additional reviews about the business. The most common next step for consumers who read reviews is to visit the business’s website (54 percent). This is an easy next step because people are already online, and there’s typically a link to the business’s website from the review sites. This does reinforce the need for SMBs to have a mobile-friendly website. Only 19 percent say their next step would be to visit a business’s premises. This will vary depending on the type of business a consumer is looking for. For instance, if they’re looking for a restaurant, the numbers will be higher; if they’re searching for a physician or wedding planner — something that might first require an appointment or phone consultation — then it’s unlikely that your next step would be to visit the business. A full 17 percent of consumers say that they would seek out additional reviews about the business they are considering. This indicates a high level of interest in a particular business — if a consumer is continuing to look for reviews, then that means they are probably getting closer to a buying decision. Have you ever been asked by a business to leave an online review for them? Key findings: 70 percent of consumers have been asked by a business to leave a review. 50 percent of consumers have been asked to leave a review about a business and actually left a review. This is important: if asked, approximately 71 percent of consumers will leave a review for a business. This reinforces the need for every business to have a reputation marketing strategy. While this finding does illustrate the importance of asking customers for reviews, businesses must exercise caution and patience in doing so. Why? Too many reviews acquired within a short time frame can look suspicious, meaning those reviews could end up getting flagged and filtered out on the review platform. Ask your customers for reviews gradually over time, and don’t overdo it. Additionally, businesses should never use offers to incentivize consumers to leave reviews (That’s considered unethical). Reviews, positive or negative, serve as a useful feedback tool for businesses. Use this information to improve your customer service or business offerings. Want to learn more?

SUBSCRIBE Common Search: The open source project bringing back PageRank Columnist JR Oakes explains Common Search, a great open source tool for understanding how search engines work, which has a hidden gem for those of us who miss checking our PageRank score. JR Oakes on November 14, 2016 at 9:58 am More Over the last several years, Google has slowly reduced the amount of data available to SEO practitioners. First it was keyword data, then PageRank score. Now it is specific search volume from AdWords (unless you are spending some moola). You can read more about this in Russ Jones’s excellent article that details the impact of his company’s research and insights into clickstream data for volume disambiguation. One item that we have gotten really involved in recently is Common Crawl data. There are several teams in our industry that have been using this data for some time, so I felt a little late to the game. Common Crawl data is an open source project that scrapes the entire internet at regular intervals. Thankfully, Amazon, being the great company it is, pitched in to store the data to make it available to many without the the high storage costs. In addition to Common Crawl data, there is a non-profit called Common Search whose mission is to create an alternative open source and transparent search engine — the opposite, in many respects, of Google. This piqued my interest because it means that we all can play, tweak and mangle the signals to learn how search engines operate without the huge time investment of starting from ground zero. Common Search data Currently, Common Search uses the following data sources for calculating their search rankings (This is taken directly from their website): Common Crawl: The largest open repository of web crawl data. This is currently our unique source of raw page data. Wikidata: A free, linked database that acts as central storage for the structured data of many Wikimedia projects like Wikipedia, Wikivoyage and Wikisource. UT1 Blacklist: Maintained by Fabrice Prigent from the Université Toulouse 1 Capitole, this blacklist categorizes domains and URLs into several categories, including “adult” and “phishing.” DMOZ: Also known as the Open Directory Project, it is the oldest and largest web directory still alive. Though its data is not as reliable as it was in the past, we still use it as a signal and metadata source. Web Data Commons Hyperlink Graphs: Graphs of all hyperlinks from a 2012 Common Crawl archive. We are currently using its Harmonic Centrality file as a temporary ranking signal on domains. We plan to perform our own analysis of the web graph in the near future. Alexa top 1M sites: Alexa ranks websites based on a combined measure of page views and unique site users. It is known to be demographically biased. We are using it as a temporary ranking signal on domains. Common Search ranking In addition to these data sources, in investigating the code, it also uses URL length, path length and domain PageRank as ranking signals in its algorithm. Lo and behold, since July, Common Search has had its own data on host-level PageRank, and we all missed it. I will get to the PageRank (PR) in a moment, but it is interesting to review the code of Common Crawl, especially the ranker.py portion located here, because you really can get into the driver’s seat with tweaking the weights of the signals that it uses to rank the pages: signal_weights = {
"url_total_length": 0.01,
"url_path_length": 0.01,
"url_subdomain": 0.1,
"alexa_top1m": 5,
"wikidata_url": 3,
"dmoz_domain": 1,
"dmoz_url": 1,
"webdatacommons_hc": 1,
"commonsearch_host_pagerank": 1
} Of particular note, as well, is that Common Search uses BM25 as the similarity measure of keyword to document body and meta data. BM25 is a better measure than TF-IDF because it takes document length into account, meaning a 200-word document that has your keyword five times is probably more relevant than a 1,500-word document that has it the same number of times. It is also worthwhile to say that the number of signals here is very rudimentary and obviously missing many of the refinements (and data) that Google has integrated in their search ranking algorithm. One of the key things that we are working on is to use the data available in Common Crawl and the infrastructure of Common Search to do topic vector search for content that is relevant based on semantics, not just keyword matching. On to PageRank On the page here, you can find links to the host-level PageRank for the June 2016 Common Crawl. I am using the one entitled pagerank-top1m.txt.gz (top 1 million) because the other file is 3GB and over 112 million domains. Even in R, I do not have enough machine to load it without capping out. After downloading, you will need to bring the file into your working directory in R. The PageRank data from Common Search is not normalized and also is not in the clean 0-10 format that we are all used to seeing it in. Common Search uses “max(0, min(1, float(rank) / 244660.58))” — basically, a domain’s rank divided by Facebook’s rank — as the method of translating the data into a distribution between 0 and 1. But this leaves some definite gaps, in that this would leave Linkedin’s PageRank as a 1.4 when scaled by 10. The following code will load the dataset and append a PR column with a better approximated PR: #Grab the data
df <- read.csv("pagerank-top1m.txt", header = F, sep = " ")

#Log Normalize
logNorm <- function(x){

    #Normalize
    x <- (x-min(x))/(max(x)-min(x))
    10 / (1 - (log10(x)*.25))
}

#Append a Column named PR to the dataset
df$pr <- (round(logNorm(df$V2),digits = 0))


 We had to play around a bit with the numbers to get it somewhere close (for several samples of domains that I remembered the PR for) to the old Google PR. Below are a few example PageRank results: en.wikipedia.org (8) searchengineland.com (6) consultwebs.com (5) youtube.com (9) moz.com (6) Here is a plot of 100,000 random samples. The calculated PageRank score is along the Y-axis, and the original Common Search score is along the X-axis. To grab your own results, you can run the following command in R (Just substitute your own domain): df[df$V1=="searchengineland.com",c('pr')] Keep in mind that this dataset only has the top one million domains by PageRank, so out of 112 million domains that Common Search indexed, there is a good chance your site may not be there if it doesn’t have a pretty good link profile. Also, this metric includes no indication of the harmfulness of links, only an approximation of your site’s popularity with respect to links. Common Search is a great tool and a great foundation. I am looking forward to getting more involved with the community there and hopefully learning to understand the nuts and bolts behind search engines better by actually working on one. With R and a little code, you can have a quick way to check PR for a million domains in a matter of seconds. Hope you enjoyed!

The page reads, “Search starts with the web.

SUBSCRIBE Google’s advanced verification test in San Diego just dropped over 89% of listings from the 3-pack Columnist and local search expert Joy Hawkins shows the results of a recent Google My Business advanced verification test and explores the new home services local pack. Joy Hawkins on November 14, 2016 at 10:53 am More I have just managed to find my first live example of the next step for the advanced verification beta test for locksmiths and plumbers in San Diego. We knew that these businesses had to pass advanced verification before November 10 or Google was going to be removing their listings. So now that we are past that date, what happened? As you can see, the search results (which only a very small percentage of users are seeing at the moment) show two different types of “3-packs.” The home service 3-pack The first local pack in the search results has a “Sponsored” message on it that says these listings are a part of Google’s Home Service section and links to this article. When I click “More plumbers” on that 3-pack, I get two different types of listings. The top listings appear to be paid, each sporting a “Send Request” button and a “Google guaranteed” badge beside it. The Help Center, however, does not really clarify if these features are paid. At first it seems that this is like the home service ads group, similar to what we’ve been seeing in the Bay Area. What’s not 100 percent clear is if you have to pay to be in this list, or if paying just gets you some type of advantage in the list. When you scroll down in the list, the bottom listings look more like organic listings (They are missing the “Google guaranteed” badge and “Send Request” button). However, they appear to be using tracking phone numbers, which makes me think maybe they could have some type of paid component. Also, when searching the names of a lot of businesses in this list, I found that many were not in San Diego, but rather in the suburbs. This also makes me think that these listings are paid. For example, Louies Plumbing says San Diego on this list, yet their Maps listing shows them in Vista. Sludgebusters Septic Service also says San Diego, but they’re in Ramona. Ideal Plumbing Heating Air Electrical is the only one I could find on both this list and the regular 3-pack. They are in San Diego, and they have a storefront. I spoke to Jim Froling from 949 Local, who has a client (locksmith) who is a part of this group. He originally posted about this on the Local Search Forum. His client is paying for this via AdWords Express, and he was told by Google that you do need to utilize AdWords Express to be in this group and that the listings rotate based on a few factors, including reviews. The organic 3-pack As far as the second 3-pack (the purely organic one), only seven businesses made the cut. These are the businesses that passed Advanced Verification. Another thing I noticed is that literally every single one of them has a storefront. They all have driving direction request buttons as well. In case you’re wondering how many were there before, on November 9, there were about eight pages of results, each page containing 20 listings. The screen shots I was tracking only checked the first three pages of results, so I know there were at least 60 local listings, all using addresses in San Diego on November 9. The pages farther back could possibly have dipped into surrounding cities. So it went from 60+ listings to seven (cutting out more than 89 percent). Any business that didn’t pass advanced verification (I’m sure a lot of spam) or didn’t have a storefront is no longer in this list. Here is a screen shot of who was there November 9. As you can see, only Powers Plumbing made the cut. Something else I noticed that might terrify some people (or make them excited) is that the paid/home services pack is now showing as well for branded searches. That means someone could be searching your business name — and beside your knowledge panel, there is a paid pack of your competitors! I’m waiting for CPCs to skyrocket now in San Diego.

Email Password Remember me Forgot password?     Log in with Facebook Log in with Twitter Log In news tech & science social media business entertainment life sports     Google Play Music now uses AI to guess what you want to listen to Listen | Print By James Walker     yesterday in Technology Google has announced a substantial overhaul of its Google Play Music streaming service. The company has rebuilt the app with a brighter, upbeat design and new features powered by machine learning. 'Personalised music' is now the core focus. Google announced the new version of the app today. It will begin to rollout as an update on Android, iOS and the web in regions worldwide later this week. Google described the new app as a "fresh take" on music streaming that's more intelligent and easier to use. The most noticeable change on opening the app will be the revamped home screen. The new design has been built from the ground-up to suit every user, creating the "ultimate personal DJ." Google uses artificial intelligence to populate the home screen with songs it thinks you'll want to hear. If you open the app while at work, it'll suggest a playlist of songs you frequently listen to while focusing. Alternatively, a set of more inspiring tracks might be played early in the morning. The home screen isn't entirely reliant on AI. It's also honed by dedicated curators to ensure there's always fresh content available in the app. The AI is there to augment the experience, making it more personal, relatable and applicable to individual users. Human input will be present in all the recommendations made by the service. Google has used the same context-aware tools that feature in its other apps to build Play Music. Because its AI already knows most users, it can begin to deliver personalised music suggestions as soon as the app is opened. The machine learning functionality is entirely optional and will be enabled on an opt-in basis. Google is anticipating that most users will benefit from the convenience it offers. "When you opt in, we'll deliver personalized music based on where you are and why you are listening – relaxing at home, powering through at work, commuting, flying, exploring new cities, heading out on the town and everything in between," said Google. "Your workout music is front and center as you walk into the gym, a sunset soundtrack appears just as the sky goes pink, and tunes for focusing turn up at the library." The new Play Music also comes with features that help to make it more accessible. While it's a streaming service at heart, Google recognises that not everyone can find a reliable internet connection during the day. To accommodate these offline scenarios, Play Music will automatically cache your favourite tracks and keep them available when the Internet isn't. Once you've subscribed to the feature, a playlist of the songs you've listened to most recently will be generated. This will be automatically updated and stored for offline playback, keeping music available wherever you are. It avoids the disappointment of forgetting to download a new album or relying on an unstable mobile network. The new app will begin to rollout across supported platforms in the coming days. It will be available in 62 countries worldwide with full support for the context-aware machine learning within. The app represents Google's growing ambitions in artificial intelligence, aiming to include the technology in all its products. In Play Music, it will be tasked with increasing convenience and reducing the gap between opening the app and starting playback. "From parks to airports to bars, whether you're walking, biking, or driving, the right music makes any moment better," said Google. "With the new Google Play Music, we're here to help with the perfect soundtrack for the things you do every day. After all, the only thing better than finding the perfect music is the perfect music finding you."

In emerging markets the growth of mobile LBS is being boosted by a growing penetration of GPS on lower priced handset tiers. Furthermore, for the third year running, location platform HERE has come top in Strategy Analytics' location platform benchmark study, and is placed well for future growth opportunities as the mobile location services market continues to evolve. Click here for the report:  http://sa-link.cc/MobileLBS Photo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20161114/438754 Rising adoption of smartphone-centric mobility apps, including Uber, Lyft, and Didi, among others, and the meteoric rise of the location-based augmented reality game, Pokémon Go, have provided a welcome boost to the mobile LBS sector during 2016. Nitesh Patel, Director, Strategy Analytics noted "Mobile location services are benefitting from the shift in demand for urban transport towards on-demand, mobile-centric services, where the smartphone plays an increasingly important role for both journey planning and the administration of these services. Ride-hailing and car-sharing will be further boosted by their integration into major mobile journey planning applications, such as Apple Maps, Google Maps and HERE WeGo, which are evolving into one-stop-shops for journey planning and support."   The report assesses the strengths and weaknesses of global LBS players, Apple, Google, HERE, and TomTom, across eight important metrics, including map and navigation coverage, indoor venue capabilities, reach across major mobile device platforms, map data visualization, in-vehicle connectivity, offline usage, local search and crowd sourcing. The race to provide the most fresh, up-to-date and accurate maps in real-time is being driven by a combination of the trend towards autonomous driving, and greater consumer dependence on smartphones for journey planning and execution in outdoor, and increasingly indoor environments. David Kerr, Senior Vice President at Strategy Analytics, noted "For the third year in the row HERE has maintained its leadership in mapping and location capabilities, followed by Google, TomTom and then Apple. HERE's ownership by car-makers enables it to leverage its strength in the automotive industry across all digital platforms, including mobile. Google maintains its leadership in business –to-consumer (B2C) LBS applications, as it benefits from preloading on most Android handsets, and is the most widely used map, navigation and local search app. Both Apple and TomTom remain in catch-up mode with TomTom aiming to improve its support of multi-modal routing and navigation, including ramping its coverage of indoor venues in 2017."

N E X T Email Print Save Text:  A A Tips for Onsite Content Optimization With a Human Touch by Nyima Bieber  |   November 14, 2016  |  993 views Tweet Kindle Email Top What drives your website content strategy? It's simple enough to set up a site based on what you think it should be about and how it should look, but optimizing it for SEO is a whole different ballgame. Why Optimize Your Website Content for SEO? Put simply, by optimizing the very signals that communicate your website's purpose, you send Google a clear message of what your site is all about. Though Google and other search engines can be surprisingly accurate, search engine crawlers don't evaluate your site in the same way that a human does, so optimization is also about including the correct coding and keywords: focusing on the meta title, creating a good description that invites people to your site, adding headers that make sense, and writing content that accurately describes what it is you do. In aggregate, those small modifications can improve not only the site's performance in organic search results but also the user experience. All that's on the surface. But, really, even basic onsite content optimization involves much more. Keyword Research We know that keyword research is important to determine what people are searching for that could potentially lead them to your website. Creating a good list is essential. You will refer to that list (editing it over time) to know how to best optimize each section of your site. Keyword research isn't rocket science, but you do need to get it right. Aside from Google Analytics, tools like SEMRush can be helpful to see which terms generate traffic and which ones are generating buzz in your industry. It's a chance to brainstorm, pop in words, and see what makes sense in the online world. You'll also develop an understanding of how people search for you or your product—which words and phrases resonate with them. There are various scientific ways to carry out keyword research, but the basic premise is this: Make a list of relevant keywords and record the search volume for each one. You can then narrow down your list, and, finally, using your good judgment, assign one or two keywords to each category on your website. Also, check out your competitors. If a competitor is ranking for a certain keyword you'd like to go after, determine whether their onsite content is helping their cause. You can check the page source to see what they are using for their meta titles and H (header) tags, but even just a quick hover over their meta titles can show you what they are targeting on each page, and whether they are optimizing their page content strategically. Writing for Humans Google recommends writing and basing "your optimization decisions first and foremost on what's best for the visitors of your site." This is a kind of a buffer, if you will, a free pass to step away from the cold hard statistical analysis and ensure your website always looks visitor-friendly. It also means no keyword-stuffing or taking the easy way out (see below for more on avoiding over-optimization). Your meta titles should be written for humans to read—making them easy for the eye to take in and easy for a person to understand. The H1s and H2s on the page should make sense, as they are the titles and subtitles within the content. They are not places to simply fill up with keywords or pop in a search engine-relevant phrase just because it has a high search volume. Think of meta titles that not only contain a keyword and tell shoppers what they are looking for but also address their intent. "Modern Mirrors to Brighten Up Your Home—Shop Now." That meta title will be more effective, and less spammy than an antiquated title that's simply a list of keywords, like this one: "Modern Mirrors | Square Mirrors | Round Mirrors." There's an Art to It Writing optimized content takes a light and thoughtful touch. You have to find a balance between writing for your audience and adding strategic keywords here and there. Doing so involves analysis and common sense. When going through the meta tags and page content for the various pages, ask yourself over and over: Does that make sense? Does the keyword belong there, or am I going out of my way to put it in there? Does this accurately describe, in an artful way, what my page or site is about? For the content modules on each page: Do they give the reader the information they need? Also, is the information clear and concise? Finally, is the content correct? Now is the time to edit and correct spelling, grammar, and punctuation issues. Your website needs to instill trust in the reader, and mistakes simply have no place on a professional website. Go on, get help, have the best grammar expert on your team go through the content with a fine-tooth comb. Avoiding Over-Optimization In the interest of driving as much traffic as possible to a website, many eager site owners will add as many keywords as possible to a certain page. It's hard to avoid—you may have just one page and one shot—to use two or three or four relevant keywords, and you want to make their presence known. Or you may be writing naturally, and, without meaning to, there are those keywords listed over and over again. Tip: After writing a paragraph, highlight your keywords in red. If they are listed numerous times, consider paring them down until they are present but not overbearing—two or three keyword mentions within a piece of text is a good guide. Over-optimization may simply result in a spammy-looking page, but even more dangerous than that is that you could be affected by a Google Panda Update. Introduced in 2011, it is used by the search giant to keep sites with poor quality, or over-optimized, content from gaining traction in the search results. Character Limits and Content: A Simple Checklist Though Google recently introduced some leeway for the character count of meta titles and descriptions, the results are yet to be seen across all search terms; Google admits it is always trying and testing, so it's best to stay on the safe side: Meta titles: 50-60 characters Meta descriptions: 150-160 characters Keywords in content: 2-3 mentions on each page. With all that in mind, it's time to optimize your website! Use these necessary website elements to your advantage in SEO. You may be amazed how much more strategic your thought process becomes when it is time to add new pages to your site or to analyze keyword rankings.

Featured Story: How to Root Android: Our Always-Updated Rooting Guide for Any Phone or Tablet Android Gadget Hacks: Unchaining Android to enable tomorrow's features today — WonderHowTo How To: Google Actually Has 4 Different 'Assistants'—Here's the Best One for You Dallas Thomas 20 hours ago Google Actually Has 4 Different 'Assistants'—Here's the Best One for You The new Google Assistant is only officially available on three platforms—Google's Pixel phones, the Google Allo app, and Google Home. However, most of the Assistant's basic functionality is also bundled into the Google app for Android and iOS, which used to go by the name Google Now, but is now referred to only as Screen Search or your Google app's Feed. Counting the three official Google Assistant platforms and the Google app for Android and iOS, we now have a total of four different ways to interact with Google conversationally. Then, when you consider that all four of these "Assistants" have their own strengths and weaknesses, things start to get a little confusing. So to clarify, we reached out to Google's PR team and got a few answers, and we'll share those below while also explaining how Google Assistant works on each platform. Don't Miss: 10 Things Google Assistant Can Do to Make Your Life Easier The Four Googles Before we get into all of the finer differences between the various ways to interact with Google, let's take a second to define them all. Google Pixel's Assistant: The voice-based Google Assistant that is currently only available on the Google Pixel and Pixel XL. Google Home's Assistant: Another voice-based variant of the Google Assistant, which is only available if you purchase a Google Home smart speaker. Google Allo's Assistant: A text-based form of the Google Assistant that you can access by installing the Google Allo app for Android or iOS. Google app: What used to be called Google Now and Now on Tap. Instead, these features are now called Feed and Screen Search, respectively, and they're both included with the regular Google app for Android or iOS. The Google app's Feed shows you cards with relevant info before you perform a search, and the Screen Search feature lets you perform a quick Google search for keywords on the screen you're viewing (Android only). Pixel's Assistant First up, let's talk about the Pixel's version of the Google Assistant. This one's probably the most confusing, because you've got voice-based interactions and text-based interactions right on the same home screen, which would lead you to believe that these are different ways to interact with the Assistant. But as the Google spokesperson we contacted put it, "There is only one Google Assistant." You see, the Google Assistant is only one part of the overall Google experience on the Pixel: When you long-press your home button, you can speak to the Google Assistant from any screen. That's it. Short of installing Google Allo (more on that later), this is the only way to access Google Assistant on the Pixel. The rest of the Pixel's Google features are all parts of the regular Google app. There's a widget on your home screen where you can type searches or dictate voice queries, but that offers the same experience you would get on any phone by installing the Google app. Don't Miss: How to Get Rid of Google Assistant on Your Pixel & Switch Back to Google Now There's a page on the left of your home screen that displays your Feed, showing you relevant information before you perform a search—but again, this is just an extension of the Google app. Makes sense, right? But there's one more wrinkle we need to address: The Google Assistant on the Pixel has a slightly different set of features than the Google Assistant on other platforms. You can ask the Pixel's Assistant to send a message to one of your contacts, but this isn't possible with the Assistant on Google Home. Same goes for "Show me pictures of [x]." And unlike the other platforms, the Pixel's Assistant has Screen Search baked in, meaning you can scan your current screen for search keywords by swiping up after triggering the Assistant—but this is only possible because of the Google app integration on the Pixel. To address these discrepancies, the Google spokesperson told us, "The goal of the Assistant is to provide the best results for the context in which you're interacting, so depending on the surface, you may get a slightly different result." Fair enough, but there are still some other minor differences between the various versions of Google and the Google Assistant. Verdict: Use the Pixel's Assistant if you want to go hands-free. The extra on-device features compared to Google Home give it the edge in voice command capabilities for now. Allo's Assistant Another way to access the Google Assistant is by installing the Google Allo app for Android or iOS. It's a messaging service similar to WhatsApp, but with one neat trick up its sleeve—you can message the Google Assistant directly, as if it were one of your contacts. For the most part, Allo's Assistant behaves almost exactly like the Google Assistant on Pixel devices, except it's text-based rather than voice-based. Another difference is that there's no Google app integration, so when you're using Allo, you're only interacting with Google Assistant. This means there's no Screen Search or Feed, but it's an understandable omission, as the Google app can be downloaded separately if you want these features. Don't Miss: Google's New AI-Powered Allo App Makes Your Messages Smarter However, there are some things that Allo's Assistant can do which other Assistant platforms cannot. For instance, "Show me pictures of [x]" still works, even though it's not currently possible on Google Home. In addition to that, you can play an emoji-based guessing game with the Assistant on Allo, but this isn't an option on any of the other platforms. So we're starting to notice a trend here: The Google Assistant can have slightly different capabilities depending on how you access it. To expand on that concept, the Google spokesperson told us: An emoji game in Allo wouldn't work on the Assistant on Pixel because Pixel is voice-only, while Allo gives you the opportunity to type emoji responses. It's still very early days and by no means is the Assistant perfect on day 1, but our goal is to provide the more relevant result for your question. — Google Spokesperson Think of it this way: The Pixel has a Google search widget on the home screen that you can type queries into, so there's no need for its Assistant to accept text input. However, with Allo, the whole point of the app is texting, so the Assistant only exists in a text-based form, which gives it a different set of strengths on this platform. Verdict: Use Allo's Assistant if you don't like talking to your phone. As it stands, Allo is the only platform where you can actually type to Google Assistant. Google Home's Assistant To summarize what we've learned so far, you talk to the Pixel's Assistant, and write to Allo's Assistant, which gives you a slightly different experience on the two different platforms. But what about the Assistant that's baked into the new Google Home smart speaker? Much like the Pixel's Assistant, this one can only be spoken to because there's no keyboard. But there's another hardware limitation that leads to a few more minor discrepancies—the Google Home doesn't have a display. For this reason, Google Home's Assistant doesn't know what to do when you ask it things like "Show me pictures of cats." But on the bright side, it also means that the Assistant in Google Home gets Google Cast capabilities. Don't Miss: 20 Google Home Easter Eggs & Fun Commands When you're setting up Google Home, you can add any Google Cast-compatible devices to your Assistant's repertoire, which includes Chromecast and Android TV. Once you've done that, you can ask the Assistant to "Show me cat videos on my TV," then the media will pop up on the external display. Sadly, this functionality is not available with Assistant in Allo or on the Pixel. But on the bright side, we asked Google about this issue, and it's one discrepancy that should actually get ironed out soon: We're working on bringing Cast functionality to the Assistant on Pixel soon. — Google Spokesperson Verdict: Use Google Home's Assistant if you're into controlling your TV, lights, and other home automation equipment. For now, it still has the edge on Pixel's Assistant when it comes to controlling external devices. The Google App Finally, there's the regular old Google app, which is available for any smartphone, and supports both text and voice input simultaneously. It's what we used to call "Google Now," though its new name is simply "Google," with the additional Now features getting new labels: Google Now is no longer a product. ... [It] continues to live in Screen Search and the Google app on older Android devices. — Google Spokesperson Not mentioned there is the Google Feed, which is the list of cards underneath the search box in the Google app. Together, Google, Screen Search, and Feed make up a pretty formidable Google experience—but unfortunately, the actual Google Assistant feature is going to remain exclusive to Google Home, Allo, and Pixel devices for the foreseeable future: We're starting with Pixel, we have no additional plans to share. — Google Spokesperson You'd think you were missing out by not having access to the new Assistant on non-Pixel smartphones, but this is not necessarily the case. Several features, such as the Shazaam-like "What song is this?" voice command, the ability to share screenshots with Screen Search, and translating on-screen text are not currently available on any of the Google Assistant platforms. In fact, if you're not interested in Google Assistant's conversational attitude on the Pixel, its text-based games in Allo, or the burgeoning smart home control features in Google Home, the regular Google app experience is superior in every other regard. It takes voice and text input as one and the same, has many features that have not yet been ported to Assistant, and offers a consistent experience across all platforms. Verdict: Use the Google app if you like to speak and type to your virtual assistant, or if you prefer extra features. For the time being, the Google app's voice and text controls offer more functionality than any of the official Google Assistant platforms.

By Ken Walker | Google 14-11-2016 By Ken Walker | Google 14-11-2016 Android. An operating system for everyone. Google Android. An operating system for everyone. Google Print Comments PROMOTED CONTENT: This post is sponsored by a third party. The Android operating system hasn’t hurt competition in smartphones. Rather, it has expanded it, writes Ken Walker. By Ken Walker, Senior Vice President & General Counsel, Google. In 2007, we launched Android, a free and open-source operating system. Smartphones back then were an expensive rarity. We wanted to change that — to stimulate innovation and increase choice for consumers — and it worked. Android means manufacturers don’t have to buy or build expensive mobile operating systems. As a result, smartphones are now available at dramatically lower prices — as little as 45 euros — and have become much more accessible to many more people. Today, more than 24,000 devices from over 1,300 brands run on Android. And European developers are able to distribute their apps to over a billion people around the world. Android is not a ‘one way street’; it’s a multi-lane highway of choice. Last April, the European Commission issued a Statement of Objections raising concerns over how we manage Android compatibility and distribute our own apps. The response we filed today shows how the Android ecosystem carefully balances the interests of users, developers, hardware makers, and mobile network operators. Android hasn’t hurt competition, it’s expanded it. First, the Commission’s case is based on the idea that Android doesn’t compete with Apple’s iOS. We don’t see it that way.  We don’t think Apple does either. Or phone makers. Or developers. Or users. In fact, 89% of respondents to the Commission’s own market survey confirmed that Android and Apple compete. To ignore competition with Apple is to miss the defining feature of today’s competitive smartphone landscape. Second, we are concerned that the Commission’s preliminary findings underestimate the importance of developers and the dangers of fragmentation in a mobile ecosystem.  Developers — and there were at least 1.3 million of them in Europe in 2015 — depend on a stable and consistent framework to do their work.  Any phone maker can download Android and modify it in any way they choose. But that flexibility makes Android vulnerable to fragmentation, a problem that plagued previous operating systems like Unix and Symbian. When anyone can modify your code, how do you ensure there’s a common, consistent version of the operating system, so that developers don’t have to go through the hassle and expense of building multiple versions of their apps? To manage this challenge, we work with hardware makers to establish a minimum level of compatibility among Android devices.  Critically, we give phone makers wide latitude to build devices that go above that baseline, which is why you see such a varied universe of Android devices. That’s the key: our voluntary compatibility agreements enable variety while giving developers confidence to create apps that run seamlessly across thousands of different phones and tablets. This balance stimulates competition between Android devices as well as between Android and Apple’s iPhone. Android’s compatibility rules help minimize fragmentation and sustain a healthy ecosystem for developers. Ninety-four percent of respondents who answered questions on fragmentation in a Commission market survey said that it harms the Android platform. Developers worry about it, and our competitors with proprietary platforms (who don’t face the same risk) regularly criticize us for it.  The Commission’s proposal risks making fragmentation worse, hurting the Android platform and mobile phone competition. Third, the Commission argues that we shouldn’t offer some Google apps as part of a suite. No manufacturer is obliged to preload any Google apps on an Android phone. But we do offer manufacturers a suite of apps so that when you buy a new phone you can access a familiar set of basic services. Android’s competitors, including Apple’s iPhone and Microsoft’s Windows phone, not only do the same, but they allow much less choice in the apps that come with their phones. On Android, Google’s apps typically account for less than one-third of the preloaded apps on the device (and only a small fraction of device memory). A consumer can swipe away any of our apps at any time. And, uniquely, hardware makers and carriers can pre-install rival apps right next to ours. In competition-speak, that means there’s no “foreclosure”.      There’s also plenty of evidence that consumers can easily choose which apps they want — something the Commission has recognized in other investigations. The average Android user in Europe downloads an additional 50 apps over the lifetime of their device. Downloading and replacing an app or widget is simple — you can do it in thirty seconds. Users downloaded 65 billion apps from Google Play in 2015 — an average of more than 175 million apps a day. Since 2011, apps offering similar functionality to those in our suite have been downloaded almost 15 billion times. Again, there’s no evidence of foreclosure. Many pre-installed apps don’t succeed, and many have been extremely successful through user downloads — think of Spotify or Snapchat. Our apps suite approach explicitly preserves users’ freedom to choose the apps they want on their phones. Finally, distributing products like Google Search together with Google Play permits us to offer our entire suite for free — as opposed to, for example, charging upfront licensing fees. This free distribution is an efficient solution for everyone — it lowers prices for phone makers and consumers, while still letting us sustain our substantial investment in Android and Play. Today’s mobile devices show all the signs of fierce competition with a wide range of business models: from vertically integrated ones like Apple’s iOS to open-source systems like Android. The rapid innovation, wide choice, and falling prices we see in smartphones represent the hallmarks of robust competition. Android has unleashed a new generation of innovation and inter-platform competition. By any measure, it is the most open, flexible, and differentiated of the mobile computing platforms. But open-source platforms are fragile. They survive and grow by balancing the needs of all participants, including users and developers. The Commission’s approach would upset this balance, and send an unintended signal favouring closed over open platforms.  It would mean less innovation, less choice, less competition, and higher prices. That wouldn’t be just a bad outcome for us. It would be a bad outcome for developers, for phone makers and carriers, and, most critically, for consumers. That’s the case we are making to the Commission in our filing today. We look forward to continuing the dialogue.

This week, Google faces a similar problem, as its search algorithm surfaces fake election results. As Mediaite’s Dan Abrams first reported, when you search “final election numbers” or “final vote count 2016,” the first result in Google’s “in the news” box is from a scrappy-looking Wordpress blog called 70 News that appears to be run by one person. The article, posted on November 12th, features the headline “FINAL ELECTION 2016 NUMBERS: TRUMP WON BOTH POPULAR ( 62.9 M -62.2 M ) AND ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTES ( 306-232)…HEY CHANGE.ORG, SCRAP YOUR LOONY PETITION NOW!” The same story is also coming up if you use Google Assistant: Ok then, Google. pic.twitter.com/am1r6T1I38— Mark Bergen (@mhbergen) November 14, 2016 First, the numbers in this post are inaccurate. Though millions of votes have yet to be counted, but Clinton has already been shown to be leading the popular vote by a sizable margin. Current counts have her ahead by around 668,000 total votes, with some polling experts projecting Clinton will ultimately rack up a 2 million-vote lead. Second, the writer of the 70 News post claims that the source material for the article is “Twitter posts,” specifically, this tweet from a user named Michael: Final #Election2016 Results By Numbers:- #PopularVote #electoralvotes pic.twitter.com/uKZevQvPfK— Michael (@Koxinga8) November 12, 2016 Michael, on the other hand, is sourcing an article from the ultra-conservative tabloid USA Supreme, which argues that Clinton might win the number of votes “counted” but will not win the number of votes “cast” because of ignored Republican absentee ballots. (Michael also believes that Trump has been singled out by God to be president of the United States, a conspiracy theory popular with 4chan users who believe that Pepe the Frog is a reincarnation of an ancient Egyptian deity.) And yet Michael — by way of 70 News, by way of Google — has become the sole source for a story squatting at the top of Google’s search results. 70 News has since updated its post with a single line admitting that CNN is showing different numbers — the headline and the body of the post remains the same. This is not the first time misleading articles have appeared inside Google’s News box. In 2014, the search engine began pulling news from all over the internet, inside of just Google-approved publications. This is why popular Reddit posts also show up in Google News from time to time. Add to all this the fact that Google’s own election result feature is a little misleading. It shows Clinton winning the popular vote, but the feature is so poorly designed that it looks like Trump has the lead: Some combination of SEO, timing, and traffic seems to play a role in Google’s search algorithm, but the company has always been vague about what factors determine a story’s position in its results. “The goal of Search is to provide the most relevant and useful results for our users,” a Google spokesperson told The Verge. “In this case we clearly didn’t get it right, but we are continually working to improve our algorithms." In most instances, the algorithm does surface legitimate sources — possibly because more people are reading legitimate news sources than fringe websites. But that doesn’t change the fact that Google is a massive platform — bigger than Facebook — and it presents its News box as a place for real news, and not fabricated conspiracy theories on a personal blog. People hunting for election results might find their way to 70 News, and despite the fact that the website looks like it was created by a man who types with two fingers, it would be hard to blame an incautious reader for assuming it was a factual publication. After all, one of its articles is currently living in the internet’s most coveted piece of real estate. Update 3:47PM ET: Updated to add comment from Google.

 Google looking into grossly inaccurate top news search result displayed as final popular-vote tally Sonam Sheth Nov. 14, 2016, 10:48 AM 61,229 facebook linkedin twitter email print A Google representative told Business Insider on Monday that the company was looking into an issue that displayed an inaccurate source of the popular-vote tally for Tuesday's US election in its top search result. The most recently updated popular vote tally, according to the Associated Press, shows Hillary Clinton with a lead over Donald Trump. Though Clinton leads in votes by 61,039,676 to 60,371,193, Trump secured the presidency by winning the Electoral College. The top Google News result for searches of "final election count," however, linked to a WordPress blog called 70 News that said Trump won the popular vote by a margin of almost 700,000 votes. It cited Twitter as its source. Google Originally posted on Saturday and updated on Sunday, the post is titled "FINAL ELECTION 2016 NUMBERS: TRUMP WON BOTH POPULAR ( 62.9 M -62.2 M ) AND ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTES ( 306-232)...HEY CHANGE.ORG, SCRAP YOUR LOONY PETITION NOW!" The author wrote that the information came from "Twitter posts." "Except for the twitter posts, the popular vote number still need to be updated in Wikipedia or MSM media — which may take another few days because the liberals are still reeling and recovering from Trump-shock victory," the blog said. The WordPress blog also shows up in the top Google News results when variations of the search are entered in, like "final popular vote." Google Other areas of Google, however, reflect the accurate numbers: Google "The goal of Search is to provide the most relevant and useful results for our users. In this case we clearly didn’t get it right, but we are continually working to improve our algorithms," a Google spokesperson told Business Insider.  With approximately 7 million votes left to count — many of them from solid blue states like New York, California, and Washington — it seems that Clinton may end with an even larger victory in the popular vote.

By Jason Cipriani | November 14, 2016 -- 15:39 GMT (07:39 PST) | Topic: Google Image: Google Google Play Music is about to creep you out. Google announced an updated iOS, Android, and website for its streaming music service on Nov. 14. The update is already available on the web and iOS, with the Android version expected to follow suit later in the day. Along with a fresh coat of paint, Google Play Music is now smarter. What's Hot on ZDNet Microsoft to replace security bulletin index with database-driven portal High performance computing (HPC): A look at what's next with TACC's Dan Stanzione If you want a MacBook Pro with a Touch Bar, you have to wait until Christmas Researchers claim quantum computing breakthrough, explain it using beer According to Google's announcement, the new Play Music service uses your location, activity, and local weather. It combines that information with curated playlists, then performs a few fancy calculations, and spits out personalized playlists. For example, over time, Play Music will learn when you're in an airport, or when you typically listen to a certain style of music, and it'll create a travel playlist when it detects you're at an airport. The same will occur when you're at home, at the office, and -- of course -- the gym. Tailoring a playlist based on the small nuances of each user's day has big potential to attract new users and keep current users, if Google can get it right. To show off Play Music's new brain, Google redesigned its home screen. When you launch the app or visit the website, you will now see a series of cards recommending new albums or playlists. Users can sign up for a free, ad-supported Google Play Music account. For those who want to ditch ads and gain the option to download music for offline listening, a Play Music account starts at $9.99 per month for an individual account or $14.99 a month for a family account.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Verizon’s shipment for Google Pixel XL delayed due to high demand By Ida Torres - November 14, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter If you’re very much excited to finally receive your pre-ordered 128GB Google Pixel XL, you might want to temper your expectations. Some users have apparently received notification from Verizon, the only carrier selling the devices in the US, that the supposed shipment of the smartphone has been delayed by more than two weeks. This is apparently due to the high demand for the first phone that has been solely designed by Google, that they haven’t been able to fix their inventory. The email sent by Verizon even had the subject heading of “Looks like you have great taste” and if you received it you probably would have been excited that the phone was on its way. Unfortunately, it was just to soften the blow that there will be a delay of more than two weeks for the delivery. The one who shared the email was supposed to have his Google Pixel XL shipped today but instead it will ship out by November 26. The only explanation that they gave is that “the item you picked is so popular” that they are unable to serve your order, despite the fact that you pre-ordered it already. They did apologize for the inconvenience, but of course it’s the standard thing to do. Hopefully, those who were expecting the phones this week don’t urgently need it, otherwise, that is a sure bummer. While Verizon is the exclusive carrier for the Google Pixel smartphones, you can actually use it with other carriers as well. In fact, T-Mobile has a promo now that they will give you 50% back of the cost of a Google Pixel, the 32GB variant to be exact, if you activate it with the un-carrier. It costs $325 so getting half of it back is not that bad.

The new Play Music utilizes Google’s contextual tools to recommend music based on where you are. For example, if Play Music senses that you’re at the gym, it’ll suggest tunes for working out. If it senses that you’re at the library, it’ll recommend music that’ll help you focus. Also rolling out is a refreshed Play Music home screen. The new home screen places a big focus on your Play Music recommendations, including the aforementioned suggestions based on where you are as well as your recently played songs, recommended new releases, and a playlist of music based on an artist that you like. Finally, the new Play Music will always keep an offline playlist of your recently played songs downloaded to your phone. This means that you’ll always  have music to listen to when you’re away from an internet connection, which could come in handy for those times that you unexpectedly find yourself without any cell signal but you still want to hear some tunes. Google’s update to Play Music is focused on making the service more personal. Not only does it try to sense where you are and recommend music appropriate for your situation, but the updated home screen places a heavy focus on this new feature as well as other recommended tunes.  The new Play Music will roll out to Android, iOS, and the web this week in 62 countries around the world.

However, Huawei wanted to expand its horizons and look to make a statement in the US market. A partnership with Google would allow that to happen, and after the agreements were taken care, Huawei began producing the 2015 Nexus flagship. Google has never gone with the same manufacturer for back to back Nexus devices, so it was extremely unlikely that Huawei would take over the reigns of the 2016 Nexus devices. However, it was revealed that Google was going to sign Huawei up for the 2016 Nexus devices until Huawei backed out of the deal, leaving Google to pursue the Pixel and Pixel XL. Now, it seems we know the real reason why Google backed out of the deal. According to a report from WinFuture.de, Huawei wanted to receive brand recognition as the Nexus 6P featured both the Nexus and Huawei logos. Since Google wanted to go a different route and was looking for a contractor, Huawei pulled the plug on the project and left Google hanging. Despite Huawei pulling out of the competition, the company continued to use the original design of the Nexus 6P for some of its devices in 2016 as we saw with the Huawei Nova and Nova Plus. There have still been some rumblings that Huawei would be tapped to manufacture Google’s newest tablet, which would be a welcome addition to the tablet market. Unfortunately, the new Nexus tablet has yet to be unveiled, but we’re still holding out hope. In the meantime, we’ll ask you what you think about this revelation? Would you have preferred to see the Pixel and Pixel XL manufactured by Huawei, or are you content with HTC winning the contract? local_offer    Huawei   Nexus   Auto-load comments: Off On View comments (28) stars Further Reading Huawei introduces Mate 9 Pro Huawei announced it has sold 9 million P9 smartphones Night mode could be returning to Nexus phones soon Best Fitness Trackers November 2016 Huawei Mate 9 camera samples stars Popular this Weeklaunch 1 more_vertThis may be the Moto X 2017 closeHere’s our first look at the 2017 Moto X The Moto X 2017 may be alive and well as a new image has appeared which shows off the device’s metal body and camera cutout. 2 more_vertExclusive: Project ARA specifications, design closeExclusive: Project ARA specifications, design and photos Today’s exclusive Google Project ARA post reveals the phone’s spec sheet and 40 images which show off the phone’s unique modular design. 3 more_vertZTE wants to step up and fill the Nexus gap closeZTE wants to fill the gap left behind with the end of Nexus devices With the end of the Nexus line, there’s now a void in stock Android devices in the $400 range.

Google says they’re putting their machine learning efforts to task by using their vast knowledge base to figure out what you want to listen to. The company will offer up playlist and track suggestions based on your environment, so if you’re going to the gym it’ll show you some workout tunes, while a night life playlist could be loaded up if you’re going out for a night on the town. Google says there are many factors which can be used to determine the playlists to show you, including weather. All of it is served up on a brand new homescreen that’ll make it easy to start playing those playlists with just a couple of taps. Beyond all this, Google has also added a dynamic offline listening experience that will automatically cache recently played tracks for offline viewing, so you’ll have some of your favorite tunes available offline even if you forget to download them before heading into a dead zone. Google says the rollout will begin at some point this week, with all 62 of the current Google Play Music markets being hooked up at the same time. Be on the lookout at Google Play and on the web.

Update from Gary - Google has not indexed all of these 130 trillion pages but knows of them. @dannysullivan @rustybrick fyi the web that we see is that big, not Google's index.— Gary Illyes (@methode) November 14, 2016 Yes, Google seems to have added over 100 trillion pages to their index in less than 4 years. When Google first announced the How Search Works section, they only had 30 trillion pages on that page. In fact, you can still see the screen shot from their own blog post showing 30 trillion pages. Here is a copy: Now, it reads 130 trillion pages, here is that screen shot: This is funny because back in 2003-2004, Google and Yahoo use to go at it when comparing the sizes of their index. In fact, Yahoo once mocked Google at their own Google Dance for running out of beer, which was a joke about their index size fight. It is a longer story but it was a joke around how Google can have a bigger index but not stock enough beer for SEOs at their own party. So are we back to index size wars? Forum discussion at Twitter.

Hilton Johani 11/14/2016 03:43 pm wow... Michael Martinez 11/14/2016 05:05 pm Their index is far, far smaller than 130 trillion pages. I estimate less than 200 billion indexed URLs. Jim 11/14/2016 05:36 pm This seems more likely. 130t is likely the total figure before considering how many pages have been removed from their index over the years. Michael Martinez 11/14/2016 07:15 pm I am sure that figure includes a lot of 404 pages and duplicate URLs due to calendar crawls and session IDs. Michael Martinez 11/14/2016 09:46 pm "how many pages have been penalized by Google quality raters?" Zero, considering they don't have the ability to penalize pages. The Web spam team does that. Anon User 11/14/2016 09:49 pm Yes. I just got a report telling me how bad I had been with an increase in 404's. The message sounds quite sinister and by the time you read if the pages don't exist you need do nothing ... well you have already shit yourself. More really poor communication from google more or less forcing people through fear to 301 pages from dead pages when they really should just let them die. Google don't like letting them die though. Google chases you for years and years with those 4004's. HOW FUCKING PATHETIC!!!! Ethan Glover 11/15/2016 04:32 am "the web that we see is that big, not Google's index" The tweet is explicitly saying that the index is NOT that big. They've seen and crawled 130 trillion, but Gary Illyes is telling you that they have not indexed that much. The "How Search Works" page actually explains that as well. Cesar Bielich 11/15/2016 09:22 am Basically google is saying they have 130 triillion page links but have not crawled all of them yet. Tadeusz Szewczyk (Tad Chef) 11/15/2016 10:53 am You are so naive. How many people work at the Web spam team? 100? 1000? How many billions of sites can they manually scan over the years? The only way Google can manually penalize those astonishing amounts of sites is with the help of the tens of thousands of part-time work-at-home quality raters. Don't believe everything what Google says, especially that they only use their feedback for algorithmic changes. It's most probably like with Facebook trending stories. Michael Martinez 11/15/2016 02:41 pm Hahahaha! Tadeusz Szewczyk (Tad Chef) 11/15/2016 04:26 pm Yeah, really funny!

This of course takes into account that the majority of Google users now “search” on mobile devices, as opposed to desktop computers, and so a shift needed to happen somewhere at some point. The fact now is that businesses will need to adjust to this new algorithm. Even if the majority of your users are not searching for your company or industry on mobile devices, you will now need to take mobile search into account for best practice SEO. Below covers the news from Google and then breaks-down exactly what you need to do to have your business be prepared. Mobile-first indexing: how it works Google announced that to date, its search engine has prioritized analysis of desktop version of a webpage’s content rather than mobile version in ranking on Google results pages—even though the majority of “Google Searchers” are using mobile devices. As you might expect, they found this to be problematic, as it did not account for the mobile version in determining quality of web pages. Since mobile pages are ultimately the preference for most users searching Google, something had to change. Google acknowledges that the goal is really to improve the experience for users, whether they are on desktop or mobile. This means that businesses are going to have to pay attention to both the functionality of their desktop page, as well as their mobile page (although this part isn’t really THAT new, since businesses should be optimizing for mobile by now). Google will continue to index on one page as it does now rather than having a separate index for website and mobile. That being said, it will now place value on mobile pages when indexing a site and determining its position on search results. Their index is actually going to be primarily comprised by mobile pages, meaning that snippets, structured data, and other content will appear on Google search results. This is clearly a huge change in indexing, and even if you have been working on mobile optimization and planning for this kind of change over the past months or years, there are still things your business needs to do to be prepared. In the next section we will explore these more in-depth so that you can make a preparation checklist as we enter the New Year. How your business can be prepared Don’t panic just yet if you feel like your site is not quite ready to be indexed for mobile, there are definitely things you can do to improve your site right away! Below are some tips to get you started that directly correlate to this new announcement from Google: Make sure to run a mobile friendly test to make sure your website is optimized for mobile use Check out Google’s primary mobile guide for more information on optimization Google’s how-to guide helps you make sure your third party hosting site is working right Optimizing for Mobile Indexing: Mobile Responsiveness. If your site already has a responsive design, by Google’s standards, you will likely not have to do much to be properly indexed for mobile. Mobile Site Configuration. If the content and markup of your site is different on mobile and desktop, you are going to have to make some changes. Read more about site configuration here. Structured Data Testing. Run structured data tests for both URLs and compare the output. Adjust any errors that might be present, but avoid adding any markup that isn’t necessary to mobile sites. Googlebots. Run the txt testing tool to make sure that the mobile version of your site is accessible to Googlebot—this will be key for indexing. Canonical Links. If your site does have canonical links, there is no need to make changes. Google claims that they will “continue to use these links as guides to serve the appropriate results to a user searching on desktop or mobile”. Verify in Search Console. If you have only verified the “desktop version” of your site, you will need to verify your mobile version as well. Building a Mobile Site. If you are building a separate mobile site, it is better to wait and launch it when it is fully functional, rather than launching it too soon. Google will continue to index desktop sites, so it is better to have a quality and complete mobile site. Webmaster Forums. If you have specific questions on your mobile site, you can contact Google Webmasters It is going to take some time for Google to make this change in prioritizing mobile indexing, so in the mean time, do all that you can to optimize your site and get prepared! Going through the optimization list will be comprehensive enough to make sure your site is indexed at this point. Google is very likely to put out more information soon, since this is so new, so stay tuned!

Ultimately, while your desktop version is the version that is affecting your search results currently, this is going to shift shortly. The sooner you can make improvements to your mobile site, the better. Keep in mind that these efforts for optimization are not just for indexing, but also for mobile users. The reason Google is prioritizing mobile pages and going “mobile-first” is because most users search on mobile, so this is really for your audience and to better you company all around!

Google Microsoft Must Read News Operating Systems Smartphone Google Takes European Union Head-on, Says Android is not Anti-competitive By Shudeep Chandrasekhar - November 14, 2016 43 0 In a blog post late last week Google Senior Vice President and General Counsel Kent Walker made it very clear that Alphabet (Google’s parent company) isn’t going to take the European Unions allegations about Android lying down. In April 2015 the EU raised certain objections to Google trying to muscle in on the fact that it owns Android, and that it was forcing manufacturers to put Google Apps on their devices by default. But Walker says otherwise: “No manufacturer is obliged to preload any Google apps on an Android phone. But we do offer manufacturers a suite of apps so that when you buy a new phone you can access a familiar set of basic services.” And that’s essentially the case in a nutshell. Walker goes on to compare what Google does with what Apple and Microsoft currently do: “Android’s competitors, including Apple’s iPhone and Microsoft’s Windows phone, not only do the same, but they allow much less choice in the apps that come with their phones. On Android, Google’s apps typically account for less than one-third of the preloaded apps on the device (and only a small fraction of device memory). A consumer can swipe away any of our apps at any time. And, uniquely, hardware makers and carriers can pre-install rival apps right next to ours. In competition-speak, that means there’s no “foreclosure”.” But the EU also made a strange point, saying that Android doesn’t compete with Apple’s iOS. I say strange because the general public seems to agree with me. In a survey launched by the European Commission, 89% of the respondents said that Android and Apple’s iOS do, in fact, compete with each other. Google has also given other examples from the viewpoints of Apple itself, Samsung, developers and users. But those are just two points in the original Statement of Objections that the EC has issued to Alphabet, Inc. Another one states the following: “Google has abused its dominant position by systematically favouring its own comparison shopping service in its general search results.” Google’s response to that, as given by a spokesperson earlier this month was this: “We remain confident that these claims lack evidence and are wrong on the facts, the law, and the economics. The surest signs of dynamic competition in any market are low prices, abundant choices, and constant innovation — and that’s a great description of shopping on the internet today.” But that’s not the end of the allegations. The EC also brought to bear some allegations against AdSense for Search, which places contextual ads near the top of search results pages. Here’s Google’s response to that: “Our text ads help websites generate income and have always faced strong competition from other ad formats, so we disagree with the Commission’s assessment. Nevertheless, even before the Statement of Objections was filed, we changed practices the Commission takes issue with, so we hope to resolve this case quickly.” So on that front alone, despite being in disagreement with the EC, Google did tweak some of the their settings. And from what the spokesperson said, it seems they did it even before the EC brought it up. That’s possibly a pre-emptive move by Google, but it doesn’t seem to have helped the case much. On the Android case, Google was given a deadline of November 11 to respond, which they have done as of November 10. Now we’ll have to wait and see what the EC does in response to Google’s statement that was filed with them last week. So the big question now is whether or not Google is using unfair practices to push its product agenda into the Android ecosystem. But Apple is certainly doing it because iOS and macOS are proprietary platforms, and Windows continues to do it for Windows 10 Mobile devices. But the problem with Android seems to be that, although owned by Google, it was designed to be an open source platform that any device maker could take and then customized for their own purposes. In the final analysis, it seems like the EC is getting pressure from smaller groups with vested interests, such as local traders and Europe-based business and website owners. It’s unclear at this point where the accusations originated, but it’s clear that the EC is taking it upon itself to fight the cause. Unfortunately, Alphabet is on the receiving end of that fight. If things go the EC way, Google could be looking at billions of dollars in fines, as well as being forced to make several changes to the way they offer their apps on Google Play. Alphabet is the world’s second largest company by market capitalization, and very close to Apple, Inc. As of 2016 Google already crossed Apple’s market cap once, in February, and both their numbers are running close to each other. But in the case of Alphabet versus the European Commission, it would seem that the former is the David and the latter is the Goliath. Can Alphabet defeat the EC on this? Probably not without making several key concessions. Follow us for the latest news in this increasingly hot debate between Alphabet and the EC.

Comments At a Glance Mi Box Android TV TechHive Rating $69.00 MSRP $69.00 View on Walmart The Xiaomi Mi Box's $69 price tag and 4K HDR streaming help paper over Android TV's shortcomings. By Jared Newman Follow TechHive | Nov 14, 2016 4:00 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Streaming Hardware Consumer Electronics Android TV Comments Xiaomi’s Mi Box, the cheapest 4K HDR streaming box on the market, comes from two names you might not be familiar with. The box is built by Xiaomi, a Chinese electronics vendor that has largely avoided the U.S. market until now. As for the software, the Mi Box runs Android TV, a big-screen operating system Google launched a couple years ago, then promptly began neglecting in favor of the more popular Chromecast. The Xiaomi Mi Box is the first new Android TV streaming box since mid-2015, and it comes with a strong pitch: For $69, you get 4K HDR video, a voice-controlled remote, a speedy processor, and Google Cast built-in. That simple formula goes a long way toward covering up some of Android TV’s deficiencies. Svelte set-top, pointy remote The Mi Box is surprisingly compact, running four inches wide and deep, with a tapered design that’s about a quarter-inch thick. It’s smaller than the latest Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV, and Roku Ultra and Premiere boxes, yet it has some robust tech specs including a 2.0GHz quad-core processor, 8GB of storage, 2GB of RAM, and 802.11ac Wi-Fi. Apps load quickly, with no major performance hiccups even in heavyweight apps like PlayStation Vue. The box includes a 3.5mm analog, S/PDIF output for headphones or digital audio connections, and while there’s no built-in ethernet port, the full-sized USB port supports USB-to-ethernet adapters, along with external storage drives and game controllers. Google has even been experimenting with USB tuner support in Android 7.0, which in the future could allow users to watch and record over-the-air antenna channels through the set-top box. Jared Newman The Mi Box has a USB port, HDMI output, and audio output for headphones and S/PDIF connections. The Mi Box can also stream in 4K at up to 60 frames per second, with HDR-10 to be enabled with Android 7.0, but you’re on your own to find supported content. There are no shortcuts to apps that offer Ultra HD video, akin to the “4K Spotlight” app on Roku players. And because Amazon Video isn’t supported on Android TV, one major source of 4K and HDR content is unavailable. (Current 4K sources include Netflix, YouTube, Vudu, Ultraflix, and Sony Ultra.) As for the remote control, Xiaomi aims for minimalism. There are no fast forward, rewind, or pause buttons—those functions are just built into the directional pad—nor are there menu or app shortcut buttons like you’d find on a Roku remote. The Mi Box remote does include volume controls, which you can adjust up to the maximum you’ve set on your TV, and a power button that puts the box to sleep. Those are worthy trade-offs in my view. My only gripe is that the remote’s sharp edges can dig into your palms depending on how you hold it. The Android TV torchbearer Where the Mi Box starts to falter is with the Android TV operating system. Android TV is adequate at the basics, offering plenty of major streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, Sling TV, PlayStation Vue, HBO, Showtime, CBS All Access, Crackle, and Starz. (Some notable exceptions: Amazon Video, NBC, and NHL.TV.) Android TV also has built-in Google Cast support, which lets you launch videos from streaming apps on phones and tablets, and from websites in Google’s desktop Chrome browser. This helps fill in some gaps from Android TV’s native app catalog, and can be faster than thumbing through menus with a TV remote. Still, Google’s living-room platform never rises above mere adequacy. It’s lacking the pleasant touches found on other streaming boxes, such as the private headphone listening on Roku’s remote controls and mobile app, or the Alexa virtual assistant built into Amazon’s Fire TV devices. Android TV also fails to execute on some of its more ambitious ideas. The Recommendations bar that sits atop the home screen is largely useless, with limited participation from streaming services, no sorting options, and a tendency among some apps to be clueless about what they’re suggesting. (WatchESPN, for instance, keeps offering days-old football reruns instead of live sporting events.) Android TV’s Live Channels app, which is supposed pull live video sources into a unified channel grid, is similarly stunted, with support from only six streaming apps. Sling TV and PlayStation Vue don’t make their live feeds available, and Pluto.tv channels consistently fail to load. Android TV’s Recommendations row is a smart idea that’s rarely useful in practice. Even Google seems to treat Android TV as an afterthought. There’s no Google Photos app on the Mi Box, YouTube’s design is out of date compared to other TV platforms, and the Google Play Music app lacks ad-supported radio stations. And while voice search is a powerful feature—supporting complex queries like “80s comedies” and showing results from across different apps—it could really use a visual overhaul to streamline the long list of results it generates. Better yet, it could act more like the virtual Assistant that’s built into the new Google Home connected speaker. One other caveat with the Mi Box in particular: It comes with some bloatware in form of 16 “Mi Box Recommends” app links. The apps aren’t all installed to begin with, and while they are removable, you have to install them before you can uninstall them. They also occupy a separate space from your main app list, making navigation a bit more confused. Pre-installed apps like Netflix aren’t allowed to mingle with your regular app lineup. Who’s the Mi Box for? At least for streaming devices like the Mi Box, Android TV still has the air of an enthusiast platform. It’s rough around the edges, but it allows tech-savvy users to sideload any Android app they want, and it supports the popular media player software Kodi. For gaming, you can install all kinds of console emulators to create your own retro gaming box. USB TV tuner support could also be a boon for cord cutters, assuming Google finalizes it, and Xiaomi upgrades the Mi Box to Android 7.0. The $69 Mi Box, however, is the first Android TV streamer whose appeal reaches beyond tech enthusiast circles. Though it fails to offer the flourishes and forward-thinking ideas of other streaming platforms, it succeeds as a cheap streaming device with 4K HDR video, solid performance, and voice search. Those same features would cost $30 more on a Roku, and Amazon’s $90 Fire TV doesn’t support HDR video at all. The Mi Box even matches the price of Google’s own Chromecast Ultra, while offering a proper remote and big-screen interface. On top of all that, you can buy the Mi Box at Walmart, the largest brick-and-mortar retailer in the United Sates. Maybe that’s enough to put Xiaomi—and Android TV—on the map.

Because ‘six seconds is more than enough’ Update: DDoS attack on Dyn DNS leaves internet crippled Big Tech / Google / Here’s how Google Play is using AI to improve search By Hadlee Simons on 14 November, 2016 HadleeSimons Share Trying to find an app on the Google Play Store can be an exercise in frustration, especially if it’s an eagerly anticipated app or new release. Things don’t get much better for mega-popular apps, as the search results are often cluttered with irrelevant results. Fortunately, Google is working on a solution, using machine learning to get better results. The company detailed its efforts on the Google Research Blog. “Searches by topic require more than simply indexing apps by query terms; they require an understanding of the topics associated with an app,” the team of software engineers wrote. The work required machine-learning approaches, but one big challenge for machine learning was the size of the data-set to work with. “While for some popular topics such as ‘social networking’ we had many labeled apps to learn from, the majority of topics had only a handful of examples,” the team explained. The neural network for Google Play search initially used the title and description to predict topics for an app The first solution was to build a deep neural network (DNN) trained to predict topics for an app based on words/phrases used in the title and description. “For example, if the app description mentioned ‘frightening’, ‘very scary’, and ‘fear’ then associate the ‘horror game’ topic with it. However, given the learning capacity of DNNs, it completely ‘memorised’ the topics for the apps in our small training data and failed to generalise to new apps it hadn’t seen before,” Google’s engineers elaborated. The team then revised its machine-learning approach, using the way humans learn as inspiration. It noted, as an example, that humans need to see very few ‘horror game’ app descriptions before learning how to associate new apps to that genre. “To emulate this, we tried a very rough approximation of this language-centric learning. We trained a neural network to learn how language was used to describe apps,” the team said of their overhauled approach, currently in use on the Google Play Store. A human touch for search results The engineers said that their new approach yielded “reasonable results” but would over-generalise at times.  “For instance, it might associate Facebook with ‘dating’ or Plants vs Zombies with ‘educational games’,” they wrote. Far from just using humans as inspiration, the team is actually using humans in the process too. “We built a pipeline to have human raters evaluate the classifier output and fed consensus results back as training data. This process allowed us to bootstrap from our existing system, giving us a path to steadily improve classifier performance.” Author | Hadlee Simons Terrible puns make Hadlee Simons difficult to work with, but he brings almost seven years of tech journalism experience to the table.

Tags : Android-Android+ Apps-Apps+ Google-Google+ Music-Music+ Google is revamping its Play Music streaming app to focus heavily on context and personalization. Using machine learning to figure out what music you want to listen to, the app will suggest songs and playlists depending on what time and day it is, where you are, what the local weather is, and other factors that could possibly affect your mood and musical preferences. The update will see a gradual global roll-out, starting this week on Android, iOS and the web version of Google Play Music. In keeping with recent Google efforts, such as Google Now and the new Google Assistant, Play Music now relies heavily on machine learning to offer a completely refreshed list of suggestions every time you fire up the app. Launching Play Music on a Friday night, for example, may yield you a wild dance playlist, while doing the same on a Sunday evening may present you with a fine selection of soothing jazz tunes, perfect for unwinding in front of the fireplace. It all depends on what music you like, however, among many other factors, so suggestions will vary greatly from person to person. We didn't even know there was music for the sunny winter days, until Play Music this morning hit us with a great list of tunes, somehow perfectly fitting for those conflictingly cold-but-bright winter days. Heck, it's not even winter yet but the app knows it feels like it already! Depending on how heavily you're wired on Google's services, Play Music will have different amount of information about your musical tastes and preferences at its disposal. If you're starting just now, don't expect to get recommendations as plentiful or as diverse as long-time users who have been feeding Play Music with info for years, but the app will learn about you quickly enough and you will quickly begin to see new suggestions and playlists popping up on your device. Contextual recommendations are becoming the norm in music streaming services these days, and Play Music is moving ahead of the curve in this respect thanks to the new highly-personalized suggestions. A single account subscription for Google Play Music costs $9.99 a month, although you can give it a try for free with the 30-day trial. source: Google Share Tweet Share Verizon vs AT&T vs T-Mobile vs Sprint TV ads: who spent what on carrier-bashing 14 Nov Prev news Best new Android and iPhone apps (November 8th - November 14th) 14 Nov Next news Close newer posts Video shows how super-easy it is to set up a new Google Wifi router 14 Nov Galaxy S8 may be Samsung's first phone with pressure-sensitive Force Touch 14 Nov 5 of the greatest outdoor, hiking, and camping apps for Android and iOS 14 Nov Best new Android and iPhone apps (November 8th - November 14th) 14 Nov Now reading: Google Play Music getting personal with machine learning and highly individualized suggestions at the forefront Google Play Music getting personal with machine learning and highly individualized 14 Nov Verizon vs AT&T vs T-Mobile vs Sprint TV ads: who spent what on carrier-bashing 14 Nov Development of Android 7.0 Nougat for the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge reportedly 14 Nov Samsung and LG might suffer sales decline in the US, says analyst 14 Nov Samsung takes us inside the Gear S3 14 Nov T-Mobile a growth story, but AT&T laughing all the way to the bank: US 14 Nov older posts Featured stories   Samsung Galaxy S8/S8 edge a.k.a.

Google Play Music is Now Smarter, Easier to Use, More Assistive LIKE   TWEET   SHARE   PIN   SHARE   POST MAIL MORE Posted November 14, 2016 at 2:26pm by iClarified · 1841 views · Translate Google has announced a total redesign of Google Play Music that makes it smarter, easier to use, and much more assistive. Google is now using machine learning to figure out what music you like, mixing in signals like location, activity, and the weather along with hand-picked playlists, to personalize music for wherever you are and whenever you want tunes. To provide even richer music recommendations based on Google’s understanding of your world, we’ve plugged into the contextual tools that power Google products. When you opt in, we’ll deliver personalized music based on where you are and why you are listening — relaxing at home, powering through at work, commuting, flying, exploring new cities, heading out on the town, and everything in between. Your workout music is front and center as you walk into the gym, a sunset soundtrack appears just as the sky goes pink, and tunes for focusing turn up at the library. The Google Play Music app also gets a brand new home screen that highlights the music that you care about at the top of your screen.

Since then, we’ve shared everything we know about the phone’s specifications and an extensive photo gallery which shows off its design. Today, we’re answering the most popular questions you’ve asked us about the Project ARA phone. If you still have questions about the phone, leave them in the comments and I’ll try to answer as many as I can. Q. How did you get the ARA phone? A. Unfortunately, we can’t say. Revealing how the phone was obtained would put people’s jobs in jeopardy Q. When is ARA coming to market? A. Google cancelled project ARA earlier this fall and currently has no plans to deliver a modular smartphone. That being said, recent reports claims that a handful of people are now working at Facebook secretive hardware division which means that some of ARA’s modular DNA may live on. Q. Why was Google’s Project ARA discontinued? A. Google didn’t give a specific reason for the closing of Project ARA. Good was reportedly working with partners to build third-party modules for the phone. Having used the phone, there doesn’t seem to be any technical reason why ARA couldn’t work as a consumer product. That being said, the developer device we have is quite big and the mechanism for swapping out modules is a bit cumbersome. Google may have realized that ARA, in its current form, isn’t well suited for public consumption. Q. What are the specs? A. We’ve already shared the full spec sheet of the ARA phone. The highlights include a 5.5-inch 1080p LCD display, 3GB of RAM 32GB of storage, 3450 mAh of battery capacity (internal and removable), 2.1MP main camera, 5MP front-facing camera (both with fixed-focus lenses), a front-facing speaker, 3.5mm headphone jack and a USB Type-C charging and sync port. Q. Does the phone work? A. It sure does. Q. What version of Android is the phone running? A. The ARA (A8A01) that we have is running on Android 7.0 (NMR1) with the August 5th security patch installed. Q. Can the phone be used as a daily driver? A. It depends. The device is fully functional, but there’s no access to the SIM card slot. We’re assuming that is located below the “removable” battery, but we haven’t been able to remove that battery from the device. This isn’t too surprising since the phone we have is intended for development purposes only. By not allowing developers to use the phone as their main device, Google was able to keep the phone hidden from the public. Q. Can the CPU be swapped? A. No, the CPU of the ARA is not swappable. The CPU is built into the endoskeleton of the phone which includes the internal storage, RAM, display, front-facing camera, internal battery, motherboard and all the phone’s main sensors. Q. Can I buy the phone from you? A. The phone is currently not for sale. That being said, the owner of the device may change their mind once we return it. Q. How’s battery life? A. Battery life is quite poor. Even though the battery capacity of the phone is quite high, the ARA typically makes it 8-10 hours with only 2 hours of screen-on time before needing a charge. Q. Is ARA the future of smartphones or just a gimmick? A. In its current state, ARA is not the future of smartphone. But that doesn’t mean modular phones don’t have a future. LG and Lenovo are trying their best to make the concept work, but it might take 5-10 years before modular phones become a staple. Q. How does the module swapping mechanism work? A. Swapping modules on the ARA is simple. Do remove a module from the phone you need to press the module release button on the side of the device. This pulls up the My ARA app and its module screen. Select the module you want to remove and you’ll then be instructed to flip the phone over. Once you do, the module will be released and will pop up from the back of the phone. Q. Why the switch from slide-out modules to pop-out modules? A. A while back, Google revealed that the slide-out module mechanism which used electromagnets to hold the modules in place failed during testing.  The new pop-out mechanism still uses electromagnets to secure the modules, but they are much larger and are placed at a 90-degree angle from the phone. It’s not as elegant as the original design, but it’s definitely strong. Q. What do the swappable modules look like? A. Modules come in two sizes: single (rectangular) and double wide (square). On the outside, they are covered with soft-touch plastic. The underside of the modules are plastic or aluminum with connection pins on one end and a slot for the electromagnet fastener. Q. What modules do you have? A. The only working module we have is the camera module. The other are dummy modules which serve no purpose. Q. Can modules be swapped out while the phone is on? A. Modules can only be removed while the phone is turned on. The software even allows the owner of the device to lock things down with a password so that modules cannot be removed until the password is entered. Q. Can modules be used in any slot? A. Yes. We’ve tested the working camera module that we have in multiple slots. However, module developers can designate an “optimal” module position. If the camera module is inserted anywhere besides the top-left slot, a message appears on the device, asking you to move the module for optimal performance. Q. How many modules did Google have for ARA? A. Google never gave any clues as to how many different modules were in development, but promo videos and photos showed that ARA’s module catalog would have been extensive. Q. Are the back panels of the module removable? A. They should be, but we haven’t managed to pry the protective panel from a module yet. Obviously, this was not a design priority for the developer model of ARA. Q. Is the phone as thick as it looks? A. It sure is. While the footprint of the phone is smaller than the new Huawei Mate 9, but ARA feels substantially larger and is more cumbersome to use. That’s all we have for now. We’re planning a few more articles for later in the week. As mentioned above, feel free to ask us any questions you have about the phone. local_offer    ara   Google   Project Ara   Auto-load comments: Off On View comments (4) stars Further Reading Free Daydream Views now available Pixel cases may cause camera issues Google Play Music gets smart redesign The Verizon Pixel XL is delayed again The Play Store sees another update stars Popular this Weeklaunch 1 more_vertThis may be the Moto X 2017 closeHere’s our first look at the 2017 Moto X The Moto X 2017 may be alive and well as a new image has appeared which shows off the device’s metal body and camera cutout. 2 more_vertExclusive: Project ARA specifications, design closeExclusive: Project ARA specifications, design and photos Today’s exclusive Google Project ARA post reveals the phone’s spec sheet and 40 images which show off the phone’s unique modular design. 3 more_vertZTE wants to step up and fill the Nexus gap closeZTE wants to fill the gap left behind with the end of Nexus devices With the end of the Nexus line, there’s now a void in stock Android devices in the $400 range.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Google announced on Monday that it’s rolling out a huge update to Google Play Music as it continues to battle Apple Music and Spotify. The latest feature, machine learning, will try to play the best music based on where you are and what you’re doing. “Google Play Music uses machine learning to figure out what music you like and then mixes in signals like location, activity, and the weather along with hand-picked playlists to personalize music for wherever you are and whenever you want tunes,” Google said in a blog post announcing the news. The experience is opt-in, which should help alleviate any privacy concerns. In other words, you don’t have to share your location or any other features with the application if you don’t want to. But it might actually boost the experience a lot. Google Play Music will play music based on your location Here’s how Google says it’ll work: “When you opt in, we’ll deliver personalized music based on where you are and why you are listening — relaxing at home, powering through at work, commuting, flying, exploring new cities, heading out on the town, and everything in between. Your workout music is front and center as you walk into the gym, a sunset soundtrack appears just as the sky goes pink, and tunes for focusing turn up at the library.” Sounds pretty fun, though I’m curious how well it will work. Spotify has something kind of similar, the ability to play music based on the pace of your run, but this seems to go far beyond that sort of functionality. The feature will hit the Google Play Music iOS and Android apps, as well as the web, this week. It’ll be available in 62 countries.

According to a post by Elias Roman, Lead Product Manager for Google Play Music, Google’s streaming music service will go beyond just figuring out what you like from the music you listen to. The update will also take into account context – things like your location, what you’re doing, and even the weather. As Roman describes it: To provide even richer music recommendations based on Google’s understanding of your world, we’ve plugged into the contextual tools that power Google products. When you opt in, we’ll deliver personalized music based on where you are and why you are listening — relaxing at home, powering through at work, commuting, flying, exploring new cities, heading out on the town, and everything in between. Your workout music is front and center as you walk into the gym, a sunset soundtrack appears just as the sky goes pink, and tunes for focusing turn up at the library. In addition, Google has redesigned the Google Play Music home screen to emphasize your favorite music by putting it right at the top of the screen and adjusting what’s shown based on your context. The service will also automatically create an offline playlist of recently played songs for subscribers to listen to when they have no data connection. It’s not surprising to see Google take Google Play Music in this direction. One of Google’s biggest competitive advantages is the data it knows about you from its many products. This sort of assistive technology is already baked into products like Google Photos and it seems natural to bring the same smarts to Google Play Music too. Google Play Music will begin its world-wide roll-out to sixty-two countries this week on iOS, Android, and the web.

However, not every site offering the same product has the same rich snippets. This could have two reasons. One, Google doesn’t deem the site important enough to show additional metadata. Or two, the site hasn’t been enhanced with Schema.org data. In this article, we’ll focus on Schema.org data for product listings. Already have Schema.org for your products? Learn how to handle your sale prices! Structured data for rich snippets The information in rich snippets doesn’t just magically appear; you have to add in the data to give Google the chance to add it to the results. Even then, it’s up to Google if your data is visible or not. Google uses structured data to include the extra data in the search results. The markup for structured data is taken from an open initiative called Schema.org. This data format is developed by several search engines to make sure data can be consistently interpreted by them. You can add all kinds of stuff, like product information, ratings and reviews, or information about your local business. Optimize your site for search & social media and keep it optimized with Yoast SEO Premium »Buy now » Info To implement structured data, you need to offer search engines the correct markup. Microdata, RDFa, and JSON-LD are the most important technologies used to work with structured data. JSON-LD is a lightweight data format that’s easy to read for both humans and machines and appears to be favored by Google these days. Remember, Bing still doesn’t support it. Rich snippets for a Sony camera on BHPhotoReview.com An example product There are two kinds of product information you can show in search results. A product page describes a single product, while a shopping aggregate page describes a list with a single product along with different sellers that offer that product. Your landing page should contain a Schema.org Product type; this is the product you are selling. It should also contain a nested Offer type; this type describes how the product is sold. The data should be present in the HTML code and not be rewritten in JavaScript. There are a couple of guidelines you need to follow to work with product markup. For instance, you must use it only for individual products, not a product category. You cannot use it for adult related products, and the name of a reviewer must be a valid name or team. Example code The code below describes an example product. In this code, you see different parts of Schema.org code, plus the way JSON-LD presents these. Some highlights: type: Describes what kind of product it is name, image and description: These are quite obvious brand: The brand of the product thing: A thing is the most generic type of item aggerateRating: A nested aggregate rating of the product ratingValue: Is the average rating of the product reviewCount: The total number of reviews offers: This an indication that the product is for sale offer: An offer to provide a service or sell a product priceCurrency and price: These are quite obvious review: A written review of the product, plus rating type: The Schema.org type is a review, of course author: Who wrote it? Has to be a real name datePublished: When was it published? description: The body text of the review name: The title of the review reviewRating: What grade did it get (1-5) bestRating: Five is the max ratingValue: The rating the reviewer gave worstRating: One is the lowest Other things you can add to your page are, among other things, availability, different kinds of product identification, like SKU, model, color, height, depth and a highPrice and lowPrice. <script type="application/ld+json">

</script> Ratings and reviews We’ve been talking about ratings and reviews in a previous article. There is a small, but important difference between a rating and a review. A rating is a value a product gets on a scale from one to five. A review uses the same scale, but also adds a written explanation text to the rating. In the code example above, we’ve added a rating and reviews section. This kind of information can be picked up by Google and shown in the search results, right beside your product listing. Keep the following in mind when working with reviews and ratings. You should clearly refer to a specific product or service. The reviews and ratings must be visible to users from the marked-up page. Use it only for a particular product, not a category. You can only use a valid name for a reviewer, so no ‘Black Friday sale: $50 off’. Plus, ratings have to use the five-point scale. Temporary price drops in Schema.org Let’s say you are running a Black Friday sale, and you want it to appear in the search results. Normally, you’d change the price in your Schema.org data and wait for Google’s crawlers to pick it up. However, there is another way to get temporary price/data changes in the results. To do this, you can use Schema.org/Offer and Schema.org/PriceSpecification. Specify the correct price and the date when the price starts (priceValidFrom) and ends (priceValidUntil). Once you have written your code, you always have to make sure your structured data is valid. To check this, you can use the Structured Data Testing Tool. If you want to update your price now, you could hit Fetch and Render in Google Search Console and Submit to index. Now, you just have to cross your fingers and hope Google picks it up as soon as possible. <script type="application/ld+json">

</script> This is only the beginning We’ve only shown you the tip of the iceberg. There’s a lot more you can do with Schema.org, and there’s a ton of terms you can add to make your listings even richer. Schema.org is a treasure trove of structured data vocabulary. On pending.schema.org, you can find upcoming terms. Remember that you should never provide incorrect metadata for Google.

And when will we have to add markup to any possible element for inclusion in the knowledge graph? Or is this a thing at all? Will Google get better with all the markup that’s already provided – even if you don’t use it on your site – and apply its learnings to any possible type of content and do the heavy lifting for us? In other words: when will schema.org and markups be a thing of the past that we don’t have to activly pursue anymore? And how long will we depend on Google for traffic?

In addition, the app can optionally save your most recent songs and a few recommended tracks for offline listening, even if you forget to download them yourself. The revamped Play Music app is available on the App Store for free. Not to be outdone by Google, rival Amazon this morning announced that its recently launched music-streaming service, dubbed Music Unlimited, is now available in the United Kingdom and expanding later today to Germany and Austria. Now with a single tap you can start the right music for any moment of your day. The enhanced system uses machine learning and the power of Google—and takes into account your location, time of day and activity—to deliver smarter recommendations based on where you are and why you’re listening, “from relaxing at home, to powering through work, to destressing at the airport and everything in between.” For example, the system may present you with one set of songs when you hit the gym and completely different songs at night, learning from the songs you typically listen to as the day winds down. Google explains the enhanced recommendations system: To provide even richer music recommendations based on Google’s understanding of your world, we’ve plugged into the contextual tools that power Google products. When you opt in, we’ll deliver personalized music based on where you are and why you are listening—relaxing at home, powering through at work, commuting, flying, exploring new cities, heading out on the town, and everything in between. Your workout music is front and center as you walk into the gym, a sunset soundtrack appears just as the sky goes pink, and tunes for focusing turn up at the library. These timely recommendations await you on the app’s revamped Home screen that acts like your personal DJ, learning not only from what songs you like but also where and when you like to listen to them. Plus, you also get in-depth recommendations based on artists you’re a fan of or music you’ve just discovered and, as mentioned, auto-generated offline playlists of recently played songs for subscribers to listen to when they have no network connection. The new experience should roll out globally in 62 countries on iOS, Android and the web. Like Apple Music, Spotify and other music-streaming service, Google Play Music starts at $9.99 per month. Grab Google Play Music at no charge from the App Store.

The update brings machine learning to the table in an effort to figure out what music you like based on what you are doing. The machine learning algorithm takes into account your location, activity, weather and playlists to personalize the music for where you are and what you are doing. The new updates roll out this week on Android, iOS, and the web. The rollout will be global with 62 countries eventually getting the new music features. The update also brings improved music recommendations with contextual tools available that power other Google products. These features are opt-in and those that sign up will get personalized music for where you are and why you are listening. That means if you are relaxing at home, you will get an optimized playlist and if you are at work you will get a playlist customized for that location. The update also makes it easier to get motivational music for your workout at the gym. Play Music has a new home screen that puts your favorite music at the top of the screen. Google says the more the new machine learning algorithms get to know you, the better the music selections will be. The updated app also keeps a playlist for offline listening ready to go. The tunes you listened to recently are packed into an offline playlist ready to go when you lose signal. Google says that it wants the perfect music to find you with this update. The exact time frame for the rollout of the new features is unknown. The rollout is starting this week, but Google isn’t clear on if the rollout is going on with all 62 countries at the same time.

Google Pixel Gets Hacked in Less than One Minute, Apple's Safari in 20 Seconds GO Chinese team of white-hat hackers uses 0-day vulnerability Nov 14, 2016 13:15 GMT  ·  By Andrei Vlad  ·  Share:  The entire debacle about security in the smartphone industry has just received another chapter and it doesn't look good for Android and iOS platforms. First of all, it doesn't look good for Google and Android, as one of the most recent smartphones launched by the search giant has been compromised in less than 60 seconds. During the PwnFest hacking competition, a team of white-hat hackers from China managed to compromise Google's Pixel smartphone in under 1 minute. The team called Qihoo 360 managed to achieve the hack using a zero-day vulnerability to remotely install code on the smartphone. Upon installing the new code, both the Google Play store and Chrome for Android displayed the message “Pwned by 360 Alpha Team.” Since this was a competition for white-hackers, the achievement did not go unrewarded. Google offered Qihoo 360 a prize of $120,000 just for being able to hack its Pixel smartphone. Those of you who own the Pixel phone shouldn't be worried though, as Google announced that the exploit found was patched within 24 hours of the event and the changes have already been pushed into the stable version of Chrome. Safari, Microsoft Edge and Adobe Flash fell, too However, the Chinese team eventually got home with no less than $520,000 in cash prizes after demonstrating additional vulnerabilities in Microsoft Edge on Windows 10 and another exploit on Adobe Flash. On a side note, iOS fans shouldn't be laughing at all, as reputable Chinese hackers Pangu Team and JH managed to hack Apple's Safari browser in just 20 seconds, thus earning no less than $80,000 in prizes. The Chinese team used a root privilege escalation zero-day to compromise the Safari browser so fast, but Apple is likely to patch the exploit in their next update. So, no matter what smartphone you own, there will always be ways to hack into someone else's data, it's just a matter of time before hackers find these methods.

(Shutterstock/Pavel Vaschenkov) Recruiters and hiring managers regularly skim through hundreds of CVs and cover letters on regular basis in search for a great candidate. In addition to having looming deadlines to make a hiring decision, recruiters are baffled as many of the CV’s they view are nearly identical; same format, style, and content. So, they only spend a few seconds on each document and quickly move on to the next applicant. But some recruiters around the world have been delighted to lay their eyes on several CV’s that are truly unique, creative, and instantly make the applicant stand out and worthy of an interview or possibly an immediate job offer. Take a  look at six of the most creative CVs, take some notes, and be ready to make your CV stand out: 1.  Middle Eastern Job Seeker Tells Airbnb Why They Really Need Her  Nina Mufleh really wanted to work for Airbnb. She relentlessly tried to get in touch with the company through emails and job listings but was not able to receive any follow-up. Nina decided to take her CV to the next level and created a mini-presentation for Airbnb showing some of the areas the company is under-performing in as well as what she will do to help reach these targets. Nina’s elaborate and unprecedented CV took her a week to create, but it attracted the attention of the CEO and CMO of Airbnb and granted her the job she dreamed of. Via Nina4airbnb.com   2. Marketing Specialist Creates a Doughnut Flavored CV Lukas Yla did not want to take the easy route and send an old-fashioned uninspiring CV. In the field of marketing, a healthy dose of creativity and out-of-the-box thinking is highly appreciated. As a Marketing specialist, Yla disguised himself as a courier and delivered his CV in a box of doughnuts to 40 different companies. Indeed, his innovative approach landed him many job interviews and great exposure on the internet. via boredpanda.com 3. IT Specialist and Designer Grabs the Attention of Google  As a specialist in information technology and a natural admirer of Google, Eric Gandhi thought that there is no better way to grab the attention of Google than to have a Google-themed CV. With his top qualities in the infamous Google search box, and his experience and skills as the search results, Eric’s CV succeeded at gaining the interest of Google and getting himself an interview. via businessinsider.com 4. Instagram Lover Dedicates a Website CV for Her Dream Job  Alice Lee passionately wanted to work for Instagram. To prove her dedication and fascination with this company, Alice created a website to host her four-page resume, showcase her skills, and to stand out among the large crowd of Instagram lovers. Alice’s site grew to become a complete portfolio of her work, which landed her many design opportunities with Google, Dropbox, Venmo, The New York Times, and others. via businessinsider.com 5. Social Media Junkie Creates Facebook Feed CV The familiar style of Facebook feed is catchy and easy-to-use. Sabrina Soccoccio decided to adopt this format for creating an unprecedented CV. She invested a great deal of effort to ensure that her CV is rich with all the relevant information about her skills and work experience. Sabrina also made her CV feed buzzy with pictures and quirky comments to maintain the social media aspect. Via creativebloq.com   6. Aspiring Editor Creates a 20-Page CV Magazine  Landing a lucrative job offer may require spending over three weeks creating a magazine-style CV with photos, stories, and experience highlights. This is what Sumukh Mehta did in an effort to work with GQ Magazine. Indeed, going above and beyond worked for this aspiring editor; upon seeing his CV magazine, the CEO of GQ offered Sumukh an internship opportunity without even conducting an interview. via mashable.com   This article originally appeared in Bayt.com.

The latest feature to receive the 'smart' treatment, is Google Play Music, which has been updated to be more assistive.

Elias Roman, lead product manager at Google Play Music, wrote: 'To provide even richer music recommendations based on Google's understanding of your world, we've plugged into the contextual tools that power Google products. 'When you opt in, we'll deliver personalised music based on where you are and why you are listening — relaxing at home, powering through at work, commuting, flying, exploring new cities, heading out on the town, and everything in between.'

'Regardless, it will be there waiting for you to press play.' The app will now suggest songs based on the weather and location of its users (stock image)  Subscribers will now also be able to listen to music offline, and the app will automatically create an offline playlist based on what you've listened to recently. Mr Roman said: 'As long as you remember to charge your phone, you'll have your favourite tunes, even if you forgot to download them ahead of time.' The update comes as other rival apps also promote personalised playlists. Last year, Spotify introduced a 'Discover Weekly' feature, which brought two hours of custom-made music recommendations, tailored specifically to each listener and delivered as a unique playlist. And in September, Apple brought out a 'For You' section, which gives listeners recommendations based on their previous artist and genre choices.  Google Play Music costs £9.99 in the UK, or $9.99 in the US. GOOGLE OVERHAULS ITS APP STORE  Alphabet Inc's Google is revamping the Google Play Store to help developers build their businesses as concerns mount that the app economy has reached saturation.  The overhaul includes recommendations with artificial intelligence and support for various payment platforms, as well as embracing other platforms like virtual reality. Google's efforts in some way mirror those of arch-rival Apple, which revamped its App Store this year with quicker review times for new apps and an increase in the cut of revenue that goes to developers.     Read more: Introducing the new Google Play Music Share or comment on this article e-mail Most watched News videos Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Man discovers wife is cheating on him following her with drone Chili's manager snatches veteran's free meal after complaint Obama on Trump: This office has a way of waking you up SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Emotional Chelsea Handler fights back tears over election results 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob Dashcam footage captures moment van swerves before crashing Obama's dig at Clinton over her ground game failures Pres.

Play it now! more GADGET REVIEWS Google's Daydream: The $79 headset that could bring VR to the masses Google's $79 headset is superb in terms of hardware - but is currently let down by a lack of apps. However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant. It's the king of the Android handsets - but still not great. Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats. The $1,000 wireless speaker that really IS worth the price: Naim Mu-so Qb review Naim's incredible Mu-So Qb takes you back to the good old days - where the music captivates and enthralls, rather that simply being something in the background. The hi-tech $2,000 spin bike that really could change your life Peloton's hi-tech bike lets you stream live and on demand rides to your home - and it's one of the best examples of fitness technology out there - at a price. Apple's new 9.7inch iPad Pro is a powerhouse you can take anywhere Apple has added a few improvements to the smaller version, creating a tablet that is astonishingly powerful, but, unlike its big brother, is something you'll be able to carry everywhere. A familiar old friend that could be the perfect starter phone: Dailymail.com's verdict on the iPhone SE The new iPhone SE has a 4inch screen and familiar design - but has had a huge upgrade on the inside, making this a perfect first time iPhone. Speaker that looks as good as its sounds: B&W Zeppelin Wireless review It's not cheap, but the $699 (£500) Zeppelin Wireless is perfect for the design conscious music fan. The iPad grows up: Apple's iPad Pro The iPad Pro is, for many, a real laptop replacement - and a way to combine work and play in a gadget that will last all day and won't break your back to carry. 'A glimpse into the future of the living room': The new Apple TV Apple says apps are the future of TV, and while its new $149 box does have some issues, its combination of streaming services, games and other apps make it the best way to make your TV smart. The end of wonky wifi: Google's OnHub It's incredibly simple to set up, and we found it tripled the speed of our home wifi connection - but at $199 is expensive.. The best all in one wireless speaker you'll ever hear: Naim Mu-so review It might not be a name familiar to the US market, but Naim is a legendary British brand hoping to make a splash with the American launch of its $1499 Mu:So speaker.

After tying up with Google to get Harry Potter spells to Android smartphones and important locations of the upcoming films to Street View, the Warner Bros. team has partnered with Amazon.com to offer a similar experience while shopping. You can try out Harry Potter spells using the Amazon.com search bar. Just type in Lumos in the search bar and your screen will go dark, with a small pinprick of light getting bigger, which eventually gives way to a promotion of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, complete with the film's trailer.(Also see: Harry Potter Franchise Is Getting 3 New Ebooks, Announces J.K. Rowling) Typing in Reducto will show glass crack on the screen, while Incendio and Aguamenti spells will be followed by a flaming fire and splash of water across the screen, respectively. The Orchideous spell will result in flowers blooming on the screen. But sadly for all you Muggles in India, the feature is not available on Amazon.in yet - though navigating to Amazon.com is not so hard.

To Google’s credit, the company has been working hard on bringing innovative new photo features to the service, as well as providing all users with free, unlimited photo backups, though at a lower quality. Google Photos for Android has received another useful update, giving users the ability to create animated GIFs from a set of two to 50 photos from their library while offline. Before the update, users could select images and create an animation, but only with a network connection, presumably because the image processing was happening remotely on Google’s servers. Now though, even when you don’t have Wi-Fi, you’ll be able to quickly generate GIFs on the device itself, and they’ll be backed up automatically once you connect to a network. This feature is Android-only for now, but Google Photos features are usually cross-platform, and iOS should presumably be getting the feature soon. Since releasing the Pixel, a phone with advanced automatic digital video stabilization, it’s clear the Google is getting serious about using the hardware to do more and more image processing locally on device.

Yesterday AAPL: 105.71 -2.72 Google & Amazon increase pressure on Apple Music & Spotify with new features, international expansion Ben Lovejoy - 1 day ago @benlovejoy Apple Music Google Play Music View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Apple Music may be working hard to dethrone streaming music market leader Spotify, but it also can’t afford to ignore the other horses in the race. Google Play Music has today launched a major revamp of its iOS and Android apps, using machine-learning to put together context-specific playlists and ensuring that you always have music to listen to even if you forget to download offline music. The move happens on the same day that Amazon Music Unlimited began its international expansion … Amazon Music Unlimited launched in the U.S. last month, complete with discounts for Prime subscribers, and has today announced that it is rolling out the service to the UK, Germany and Austria (via TechCrunch). The service is already live in the UK, with Germany and Austria following later today. But is is Google Play Music’s new-found intelligence that may pose the bigger threat. While Apple Music aims to learn your tastes and present a mix of human-curated and algorithym-based playlists, Google is upping the ante with recommendations based on where you are and what you are doing. If Google can see you’re at the airport, for example, it will recommend music designed to de-stress you, even factoring in that day’s weather. As 9to5Google explains: Specifically, Google Play Music uses machine learning to figure out what songs you like and then factors in signals — location, activity, and weather — with hand-picked playlists to deliver personalized recommendations wherever you are and whenever you want. With a big focus on context, opting in to the new features will deliver “personalized music based on where you are and why you are listening.” The latter includes everything from “relaxing at home, powering through at work, commuting, flying, exploring new cities, heading out on the town, and everything in between.” The app also now automatically downloads both recent tracks and recommended music to your phone so that you always have offline music to listen to even if you forget to download it manually. The new features have already rolled out to the iOS app available on iTunes. Back in September, Spotify announced that it had 40M paid subscribers (with a further 60M ad-supported free ones), while Apple hit 17M earlier the same month. Neither Google Play Music nor Amazon Music Unlimited have yet announced their subscriber numbers. It was reported last month that Apple Music was considering a price-cut for existing subscribers, on either a temporary or permanent basis, but as subscription rates are set in agreement with labels, it’s unclear how this could be achieved. Spotify has not been having the happiest of times of late, with reports of malware ads in the free version and out-of-control data writes that could reduce the life of SSDs.

Not only has it introduced the Daydream platform, which other manufacturers will surely develop for, it also has the Daydream View headset. Snap Inc. puts Snapchat on your face: Snapchat is looking to increase the amount of pictures you post with their new Spectacles glasses.

LED e-sneakers: Vixole’s product is billed as the world’s first customizable midtop e-sneakers. You can put virtually anything on them, and they are available for a pretty reasonable price. Will this soon become the vehicle for walking advertisements? Sausage drone fiasco: An Australian man is in big trouble after filming a drone-sausage delivery to his friend awaiting in a hot tub.

Google Chrome Has 2 Billion Active Installs on Desktop and Phones GO Google’s browser rules both the desktop and mobile worlds Nov 14, 2016 11:59 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Microsoft might be working hard on making Edge a better browser for Windows 10 users, but it’s another browser that’s leading the pack right now, and it comes from long-time rival Google. Google Chrome is currently the most used browser on Windows, but according to stats provided by the search giant itself, the popularity of this app goes beyond the PC. Statistics provided by Chrome Engineering VP Darin Fisher at the Chrome Dev Summit reveal that Google Chrome has no less than two billion active installs across the world (not to be confused with the number of users, though, which as far as we know is around 1 billion). 1 in 2 PCs running Chrome right now This includes the PC and mobile, as Google Chrome has grown a lot lately on smartphones, be they powered by Android and iOS (Windows phones are not included in these statistics, as a Chrome version for Microsoft’s platform is not available). “I wanted to make this point that there are a lot of Chrome browsers out there,” Fisher was quoted as saying. “What’s exciting about this to you all is that when you think about building for the web, there’ a lot of browsers out there that implement the latest web standards - that implement the latest and greatest web features.” While Google didn’t provide figures as to how many users Chrome currently has, third-party market share analysts put the company’s browser at the lead of the chart, with more than 50 percent share. NetMarketShare, for instance, claims that Google Chrome has a 54 percent market share, while Microsoft’s new Edge browser is only far behind with a little over 5 percent. Google Chrome has no rival at this time on the desktop, and not even Firefox can keep up - Internet Explorer is declining on a monthly basis, with Microsoft no longer releasing new features, as it’s focusing on Edge. Obviously, Google is very keen on continuing the growth of Chrome on all supported platforms, so it’s becoming pretty hard for any other company, including here Microsoft, to dethrone it in the browser battle. #Google#Google Chrome#desktop#smartphones#browser subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Microsoft Will Defend World Chess Champion Against Russian Hackers Microsoft: Windows 10 Not Showing Ads, but Only “Windows Tips Notifications” Windows 10 Displaying Browser Ads in the Taskbar When Using Google Chrome - Updated Microsoft Loses 331 Million Browser Users to Google Chrome and Firefox Apple Insider Says iPhone 6 Plus Has a Major Bug, Company Should Start Recall Hackers Steal FIFA Currency, Buy Houses and Expensive Cars with the Money WhatsApp Announces Video Calling Rolling Out to Android, iOS Users Microsoft Announces Black Friday 2016 Deals: Perfect Time to Go Windows 10 KDE Frameworks 5.28.0 Released with Numerous KWayland Improvements, More NVIDIA Makes Available GeForce Graphics Driver 375.86 - Get It Now Microsoft CEO Meets Chinese Official One Day After Warning on Trump Tax Plan Apple Downplays Microsoft Surface, Says Having Touch on a Desktop Is a Disaster    Google Chrome is available on the majority of platforms, desktop and mobile New Apps Mendeley Desktop: Academic reference manager to put together and administer research papers, collaborate with other professors or students, create bibliographies and more Snappy Fax Lite: Send fax messages, forward them to a specified email address or export them with the help of this reliable and user-friendly software solution GoodSync2Go: Portable folder backup and synchronization utility that can analyze and compare the content of two directories, find differences and copy files at high speed Audacity: Free and open-source multi-track audio editor and recorder with extensive plugin support for effects, generators, analyzers, and more Lazarus: A full-featured Delphi programming environment that bundles a user-friendly IDE, enabling you to create cross-platform applications Portable Privacy Drive: Protect your sensitive data by creating an encrypted virtual hard disk where to store confidential documents and other private files Tower: A powerful Git client that enables you to conduct version control and efficiently manage your repositories, with support for multiple sources Reader comments The New Microsoft Is Playing Dirty like the Old Microsoft, Says Salesforce CEO more on: Microsoft i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Released Monday on World Diabetes Day, users who visit Google's homepage will be treated to yellow-tinted artwork of Banting alongside Google's logo which includes a bottle of insulin. Banting, alongside his colleague Dr. Charles Best, successfully extracted insulin from the pancreas in 1921 after years of experiments. Then in 1922, diabetic teenager Leonard Thompson became the first person to receive an insulin injection to treat Type 1 diabetes. In 1923, Banting, alongside John Macleod who had helped the research get funded, was awarded with The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discovery. He was knighted by King George V in 1934. Today, insulin which helps treats millions is produced by growing bacteria after pig pancreases were used to obtain it until the 1980's.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY   TRIVIA Search How-To Geek How to Secure Your Google Account Out of all your online accounts, there’s a good chance that Google holds most of your information. Think about it: if you use Gmail for email, Chrome for web browsing, and Android for your mobile OS, then you’re already using Google for almost everything you do. Now that you’re thinking about how much of your stuff is stored and saved by Google, think about how secure that account is. What if someone got access to your Google account? That would include bank statements in Gmail, personal files in Drive, stored pictures in Google Photos, chat logs from Hangouts, and a lot more. Scary thought, right? Let’s talk about how to make sure your account is as secure as it can be. Start with a Security Checkup Google makes checking your account security very easy: just use the built-in Security Checkup tool on your account’s “Sign in & security” page. When you click the “Security Checkup” option, you’ll be tossed into a multi-section form that will basically just ask you to review and confirm some information—this shouldn’t take that long, but you’ll definitely want to take your time and thoroughly review the information you find here. Set a Recovery Phone and Email The first option is very simple: confirm your recovery phone number and email address. Basically, if you get locked out of your Google account, you’ll want to make sure this stuff is correct. Also, you’ll get an email on your recovery account whenever your primary account is logged into a new location. See Recent Security Events Once you’ve confirmed that info, go ahead and click “Done.” This will bring you into the Recent Security Events menu—if you haven’t made any security-related changes lately, then the odds are you won’t have anything here. If there is something and you haven’t made any changes, definitely take a closer look—this could be indicative of some sort of suspicious activity on your account. If something is listed here (as it is in my screenshot), you can find out what it is by clicking the down arrow next to the date and time. As you can see below, my specific event was the revoking of mail permission on my iPad. I no longer have that tablet, so there’s no need for it to have permission. Again, if everything looks good, give the “Looks good’ button a click. See What Other Devices Are Logged Into Your Account RELATED ARTICLE How to See Other Devices Logged in to Your Google Account The next section may or may not take a while, depending on how many devices you have connected. This is definitely something you’ll want to pay attention to, however: if you no longer have or use a specific device, there is no reason for it to have access to your account! It’s also worth noting that if you’ve used the device semi-recently, the time, date, and location will show up next to the name. To get more information about particular devices, click the down arrow at the end of the line. New devices will also be highlighted here, along with a warning that if you don’t recognize it, someone may have access to your account. Clean Up Apps That Have Permission to Access Your Account The next section is another important one: Account Permissions. Basically, this is anything that has access to your Google Account—anything you’ve logged into with Gmail or otherwise granted permissions to with your account. The list will not only show what the app or device is, but exactly what it has access to. If you don’t remember granting something access (or just no longer use the app/device in question), then click the “remove” button to revoke its account access. If it’s an account you actually use and accidentally remove, you’ll just have to re-grant it access the next time you log in. Lastly, you’ll go over your 2-step verification settings. If you don’t have this set up, we’ll do that down below. If you do, however, make sure everything is up to date—double check your phone number or other authentication method and confirm that your backup code amount is correct—if you’ve never used a backup code for anything but have fewer than 10 left available, something isn’t right! If, at any point during the checkup process, you see something amiss, don’t hesitate to hit the “Something looks wrong” button—it’s there for a reason! Once you give it a click, it will automatically suggest that you change your password. If something really is wrong, that’s something you’re going to want to do. While the checkup process itself is very useful, you’ll also need to know how to manually access and change settings yourself. Let’s look at the most common right now. Use a Strong Password and 2-Step Verification If you’ve been on the internet for any reasonable amount of time, then you already know the spiel: use a strong password. Your child’s name or birthday, your birthday, or anything else that can be easily guessed are not examples of strong passwords—those are the kinds of passwords you use when you basically want your data to get stolen. Hard truth, I know, but that’s what it is. RELATED ARTICLE Why You Should Use a Password Manager and How to Get Started We highly, highly recommend using some sort of a password generator and manager to get the strongest passwords possible—one that’s part of a password vault is even better. My personal favorite of the bunch is LastPass, which I’ve been using for a few years now. When it comes to new passwords, this is my go-to: I just let LastPass generate a new password and save it, and I never think about it again. As long as I remember my master password, then that’s the only one I’ll ever need. You should look into doing the same—not just for your Google account, but for all your accounts! We have a full guide on how to do that here. RELATED ARTICLE What Is Two-Factor Authentication, and Why Do I Need It? Once you have a strong password, it’s time to set up 2-step authentication (also commonly referred to as two-factor authentication or “2FA”). Basically, this means that you need two things to get into your account: your password, and a second form of authentication—generally something that is only accessible to you. For example, you can receive a text message with a unique code, use an authentication app on your phone (like Google Authenticator or Authy), or even use Google’s new code-less authentication system, which is my personal favorite. That way, your device is secured with something you know, and something you have. If someone gets your password, they won’t be able to access your account unless they’ve also stolen your phone. To change your password or set up 2-step verification, you first need to head into your Google Account Settings, then select “Sign-in & security.” From there, scroll down to the “Sign in to Google” section, which is where you’ll see a breakdown of pertinent information, like the last time you changed your password, when you set up 2-step verification, and the like. To change your password (which is something I am apparently long overdue for), click the “Password” box. You’ll first be asked to input your current password, then be presented with a new password entry box. Easy enough. To set up or change your 2-step verification settings, go ahead and click that link on the main “Sign-in & security” page. Again, you’ll be prompted to enter your password. If you’ve never set up 2-step verification on your Google account, you can click the “Get Started” box to, um, get started. It’ll ask you to sign in again, then send a code either via text message or phone call. Once you get the code and enter it into the verification box, you’ll be asked if you want to enable 2-step verification. Go ahead and click “turn on.” From now on, you’ll be sent a code every time you try to log in to your Google account from a new device. Once you have 2-step verification set up (of if you had it set up in the first place), you can control exactly what your second step is—this is where you can change to the code-less “Google Prompt” method, switch to using an authenticator app, and make sure your backup codes are current. To set up a new second step method, just use the “Set up alternative second step” section. Boom, you’re done: your account is now much safer. Good for you! Keep an Eye on Connected Apps, Device Activity, and Notifications The rest of the security page is pretty straightforward (and also a part of the Security Checkup we talked about earlier), as it covers connected devices, apps, and notification settings. More than something you can actively do, everything in the “Device activity & notifications” and “Connected apps & sites” are something you’ll have to passively keep an eye on. You can monitor account activity here—like devices that have recently been signed into your Google account, for example—along with currently logged-in devices. Again, if you’re no longer using a device, revoke its access! You can get more information about events and devices by clicking the respective “Review…” link. To remove a device, simply click on the device and choose “remove.” It’ll ask you to confirm the removal, and that’s about it. Yeah, it’s that easy. You can also control your security alerts here—this is a simple section that basically lets you set when and where you get notifications for specific events, like “Crucial security risks” and “Other account activity.” Managing your connected apps, websites, and saved passwords is just as straightforward: click the “Manage…” link for more information, and remove anything you’re no longer using or want to save. Check back in with these pages once in a while and clean out anything that doesn’t need access. You’ll be happier and more secure for it. Securing your Google account isn’t hard, nor is it all that time consuming, and it’s something that everyone who has a Google account should do. Google has done an excellent job of putting everything in one place and making it incredibly easy to parse, control, and edit.

Nov, 12:00 How do you like your smartphone? Large or small? High end or affordable? Many or few apps? In folders or spread out all over your home screen? Which apps do you use the most? Have a look at anyone’s phone today and it won’t be like yours. Nearly a decade ago, we launched Android, our open-source mobile operating system. In those days smartphones were still rare, our aim was to make them available for everyone - to increase choice and innovation by stimulating competition. Today, there are over 24,000 devices running on Android from over 1,300 brands. A million apps and more to choose from. That degree of competition, choice, and innovation has brought devices for as little as €45 to the world. That’s at the heart of Android. The popularity of these devices isn't the only reason Android is in the news. Android is for everyone You may also have heard that the European Commission has asked questions about how Android works for phone manufacturers, app developers, and for you, the user. Last week, we shared our formal response to the questions raised by the commission ; we’ve explained how Android has fostered competition and spurred growth in Europe. Tim Berners-Lee famously said of the World Wide Web: "This is for everyone," and Android is absolutely for everyone. Anyone can make an app, anyone can design and market a phone. That's a marked contrast to when I joined Google in 2007 (before Android). Back then anyone making an app had to customise and test it on a huge variety of operating systems, devices and networks - hundreds of them. Those phones were definitely not for everyone. Open-source In 2006, only one percent of the world had a smartphone. We wanted to transform that; today, more than 1.4 billion people around the world use devices running Android. But Android was very different from the closed operating systems and devices that were standard at the time. Working closely with the mobile phone industry, we created a new, open approach for smartphones. At the centre was - and is - a free, open-source operating system. This creates a level playing field on which device makers, developers, mobile operators can all compete, ultimately to the benefit of consumers. Today, Android phones and tablets are available at prices. Android enables smaller phone manufacturers - like Wiko and Archos in France - to compete with the industry’s giants by lowering barriers to entry and allowing them to build whatever they can imagine, with or without apps from Google. The Possibilities of smartphones Today there are sustainable phones with replaceable parts; tablets for toddlers with big, bright buttons; dual SIM phones that allow you to run multiple subscriptions - and everything in between. Today’s smartphones truly are for everyone. Our aim at Google is to organise the world's information; these days smartphones are the main way that people access information online. Whether it's finding a recipe to follow, or getting a date for tonight - and a restaurant tip for where to go - we use our phones to do it. Not just by searching the web, but also via apps. The Play Store - where you can download apps for Android devices - has created a diverse online marketplace where competition flourishes. European superstars have emerged, from fluffy and furious Angry Birds to the breezy practicality of France's BlaBlaCar ride-sharing app. In fact, European app developers lead the field, with 40 of the top 100 grossing apps in the EU and US created by European companies. All this activity has a very real economic impact, at a time when Europe is searching for growth. Mobile phones, mobile growth The European Union is updating laws to create a Digital Single Market, that will make it easier for European entrepreneurs and businesses to make the most of the opportunity. Mobiles contribute $3.1 trillion (€2.8 trillion) to the global economy - about 4.2 percent of GDP. In Italy alone, Android has generated 79,000 new app developer jobs since its inception. This is only the start - as more people get smartphones, start coding, and get involved, the apps sector alone could create 4.8 million new European jobs by 2018. Unlike other phone operating systems, device manufacturers, or mobile carriers can tinker with and customise the software itself; they can also ship Android devices with or without Google's applications - and if they do want to ship phones with Google apps pre-installed, there are no restrictions on pre-installing competing apps. It takes seconds to download and install an app - one of any millions on the Play Store. The average Android phone comes with roughly 45 apps pre-installed and the average user downloads another 50 or so themselves. When it comes to choice for consumers, with Android, the options are endless. Android: the freedom of choice Choice is also about being free to leave and we’ve built Android so that you can disable any pre-installed app, including any from Google. You can replace a search box or browser in around 30 seconds with just a few taps of your finger. If you don’t believe me, have a browse through all the different web browsers available on Play: Firefox has been downloaded more than 150 million times on Google Play and Opera is above the 200 million download mark. People all around the world use Android because of the choice it offers. Here in Europe we’re incredibly proud of that fact because in making a product "for everyone," the freedom to choose matters. We agree with the European Commission that choice is critically important and we believe that the story of Android - built for everyone - shows that we have increased choice for consumers. We’re very proud of the fact that millions of people around the world agree.

Thanks to its hold on your e-mail, calendars, maps, traffic app and even the motion sensor on your phone, Google can deliver music to get you ready to work out at the gym, ease into a vacation and even pick you up if you’ve been complaining about being blue. 1 The tech giant will use artificial intelligence to work out your mood Google launches the Pixel smartphone to take on the Apple iPhone “Google understands the kind of place you’re at, so home means something different from the gym, a bar, a park or an airport,” Elias Roman, product manager at Google Play Music, told The New York Post. “We understand activity so with device sensors we understand differences between driving, running and biking and weather that drives what we do and what we want to feel like,” said Roman, who sold intelligent streaming service Songza to Google in 2014. The relaunched streaming service, with its spooky smart AI, is aimed at “making people feel how they want to feel.” In addition, Google Play Music understands what is called characteristic popularity — which means it knows what the people in your city are listening to and can serve up similar music.

In a blog post, Google said the app will completely refresh its track recommendations every time it’s opened up, offering playlists that take into account past listening habits and other contextual indicators. "When you opt in, we'll deliver personalised music based on where you are and why you are listening – relaxing at home, powering through at work, commuting, flying, exploring new cities, heading out on the town and everything in between," said the company. The new Google Play Music can also determine when users are offline and automatically offers a playlist based on recent listening activity even if the tracks haven’t been previously downloaded. The updated features will roll out globally this week for Android, iOS and web users in 62 countries.

So what’s new? Firstly from the limited screenshots we’ve seen with the announcement at least part of the app has been redesign with a bold mix of Material Design and hero images on a new homepage, and of course, what updated Google service would be complete without some Machine Learning thrown in. The new service is apparently  ‘smarter, easier to use, and much more assistive’, all thanks to Google’s blend of Machine Learning and ‘hand picked’ (we’re assuming these are human hands) music. The service seems to be an extension of the existing “play music for” section of Google Play Music all access, offering an enhanced curation experience from the original. The Machine Learning will learn what music you like and then mix that in with other ‘signals’ including location, activity, and the weather. This ‘machine profile’ will then apparent be matched against the curated playlists to give you an enhanced auto-curated playlist. The new service will commence rolling out this week to Android, iOS and web users ‘globally’ (62 different countries, the other countries must be on the flat bit of the earth!). For those who are worried about Google marrying user data, Machine Learning and their music preferences, the new service seems to be ‘opt-in’ so if you don’t want some robot choosing your tunes you don’t have too. Google are also introducing what looks to be an auto caching offline playlist based on your recent listening habits. It looks like this will be an ever-changing dynamic list of music that will continually change to ensure that even when you’re offline your music will still be there ready to go. We don’t know what’s more exciting, the prospect of an improved Google Play Music experience of the fact that it didn’t leak beforehand and we get to enjoy the news. We’ll obviously be trying to get out hands on the new music app and run it through its paces. Let us know if you like the sound of Googles part man part Machine (learning) music curation service.   Source: Google.

Can’t wait to check it out. Have been using the “Mood” Based stations lately and many of them are quite good! Wonder if it will also include better integration with the Google Assistant and hence, Home? Metro-Dyke Still waiting for podcasts to come to gmusic in Aus :'( Duncan_J indeed! And for out podcasts to be allowed in! Phillip Molly Malone FYI. Just went to the Web version and already getting the new version. There is an option in the setting where you can pick Genres and artists you like to help out the the recommendations. Alfredo Hernández Could you share some screenshots? Fred Two things: 1) Does it make it easier to play my music, from my servers, without mucking about? If not, it’s not addressing the elephant in the room. I’m not really interested in gifting google $10 a month for the rest of my life. 2) Oh joy, even more whitespace filled with images. Two options on that phablet screen, such great design… Phillip Molly Malone From your servers? Sounds like you want Plex. You can upload your own MP3’s and use that. Worked great for a while for me but when it was $17 (about) for: a) 6 family accounts b) Huge music library c) YouTube Red – No ads on Youtube, Background play, Offline viewing,Music videos/YT Music Its just a no brainer for me! My kids love it. Both love their music and one is a YouTube addicted and before we go anywhere builds up his offline videos to get his hourly fix! 😉 David Jacka Just got it on the iPhone tonight virduk Amused I get it on my iOS device first. Seems alright. Or at least it’s an improvement, though still a ways behind the Apple Music main screen. Still wish it surfaced playlists much better like Spotify does. And I still wish they improved the limited number of genres they surface in areas like the ‘favourite genres’ configuration for improving reccomendations. Jared Geuther If the free version still puts ads in-between songs i have on the device i still won’t use it. I can see if I’m streaming radio or listening to a channel or accessing a separate library, but ads on songs I own are ridiculous. i prefer plex as It has no ads and I can set it up how i like it. Robert Bray If you’re streaming them (IE: Have uploaded them and are playing), that still takes resources on their end. Manoj That part where you said I can opt in to cancel the recommendation is what I’m looking forward to. That machine isn’t learning from my listening behaviour at all. Robert Bray Are you liking? Or just listening? If just listening, less so (As someone with a three year old whose account plays a *lot* of Disney songs, I’m grateful for this) For liking, weird. My auto list produces long reams of gold. Manoj I only listen, never hit like. None of us in our family account hits like and we always only listen to metal. But it’s very lazy in recommending metal or showing up new metal releases. That mood thing is never us. We’re always in a good mood to listen to some really good heavy metal. Robert Bray That might be the problem. Start hitting like (Thumbs up, whatever) on the good stuff. This is how it learns. It’s not going off your listening habits (actually, it does sometimes. I’ve almost had an accident when I couldn’t stand listening to random disney while driving, but that’s random) Adam Hopefully the “new releases” section is smarter now; it completely left off a new album from a popular Canadian band last week, and should have at least recognised from the massive amounts of plays their previous albums have gotten on my account, to include it. Funnily enough, Google Now *did* let me know the album was out, but Play Music didn’t have it in new releases, had to search for it. David Anderton Wondering why my comment had been blocked? Duncan_J Hey David, we have nothing pending moderation? Try reposting the comment. David Anderton Strange it shows on the Disqus page as awaiting moderation. I was just saying that Google music have stuffeded up my last order(the songs on the server are corrupted for everybody) and even after a month of complaints from myself and others they sail haven’t fixed the songs. Apple and Amazon both also had the same songs corrupted on release but fixed then after a couple of days. After this failure of customer service I’m not buying music from Google again. Taleim Looks interesting…But not sure about some recommendations (rap in the morning?) Should pick that I like some power metal on the way to work, maybe a bit of folk metal at work, and death metal on the way home 🙂 wish you could exclude genres! wjbeckett I assume this is as much a server side switch as it is the new apk? Still not seeing the updated UI… 🙁 Ausdroid’s Device Comparison Want to compare devices from our database? You can. Go for it.

The latest feature to receive the 'smart' treatment, is Google Play Music, which has been updated to be more smarter and more helpful. The app now uses machine learning to suggest songs based on signals including location, activity and the weather. The latest feature to receive the 'smart' treatment, is Google Play Music, which has been updated to be more assistive. The app now uses machine learning to suggest songs based on signals including location, activity and the weather GOOGLE PLAY'S FEATURES The app now uses machine learning to suggest songs based on signals including location, activity and the weather.  The layout of the app has also changed, introducing a new home screen, which features the music you are interested in at the top of the screen.  Subscribers will now also be able to listen to music offline, and the app will automatically create an offline playlist based on what you've listened to recently.  In a blog, Google announced that starting this week, Google Play Music users on Android, iOS and the web in 62 countries around the world will receive the update. Elias Roman, lead product manager at Google Play Music, wrote: 'To provide even richer music recommendations based on Google's understanding of your world, we've plugged into the contextual tools that power Google products. 'When you opt in, we'll deliver personalised music based on where you are and why you are listening — relaxing at home, powering through at work, commuting, flying, exploring new cities, heading out on the town, and everything in between.' The layout of the app has changed, introducing a new home screen, which features the music you are interested in at the top of the screen.

Share this article Share Mr Roman wrote: 'Maybe that's your favourite new release on Friday, the dance party playlist you listen to after work, or more music from a new artist you've just fallen in love with. 'Regardless, it will be there waiting for you to press play.' The app will now suggest songs based on the weather and location of its users (stock image)  Subscribers will now also be able to listen to music offline, and the app will automatically create an offline playlist based on what you've listened to recently. Mr Roman said: 'As long as you remember to charge your phone, you'll have your favourite tunes, even if you forgot to download them ahead of time.' The update comes as other rival apps also promote personalised playlists. Last year, Spotify introduced a 'Discover Weekly' feature, which brought two hours of custom-made music recommendations, tailored specifically to each listener and delivered as a unique playlist. And in September, Apple brought out a 'For You' section, which gives listeners recommendations based on their previous artist and genre choices.  Google Play Music costs £9.99 in the UK, or $9.99 in the US. GOOGLE OVERHAULS ITS APP STORE  Alphabet Inc's Google is revamping the Google Play Store to help developers build their businesses as concerns mount that the app economy has reached saturation.  The overhaul includes recommendations with artificial intelligence and support for various payment platforms, as well as embracing other platforms like virtual reality. Google's efforts in some way mirror those of arch-rival Apple, which revamped its App Store this year with quicker review times for new apps and an increase in the cut of revenue that goes to developers.     Read more: Introducing the new Google Play Music Share or comment on this article e-mail Most watched News videos Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Man discovers wife is cheating on him following her with drone Chili's manager snatches veteran's free meal after complaint Obama on Trump: This office has a way of waking you up SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Emotional Chelsea Handler fights back tears over election results 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob Dashcam footage captures moment van swerves before crashing Obama's dig at Clinton over her ground game failures Pres.

However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses.

By Himanshu Goenka @HimGoJourno On 11/14/16 AT 6:14 AM Close As if filtering emails, recommending search queries, providing alerts for upcoming travel and updates from sports, and other such things was not enough, Google is now bringing its machine learning to another aspect of your life — the music you listen to. In a blog update Monday, the internet behemoth said: “Building on our commitment to help you find the right music for any moment, today we’re introducing the new Google Play Music — a fresh take on our music streaming service that is smarter, easier to use, and much more assistive. To deliver that, Google Play Music uses machine learning to figure out what music you like and then mixes in signals like location, activity, and the weather along with hand-picked playlists to personalize music for wherever you are and whenever you want tunes.” The new experience will be rolled out via an update to the Play Music app, which will start being available in 62 countries across Android, iOS and web platforms this week. Users will have to opt in to the new service which will personalize music based on your location and what you are up to. For example, workout music will start up when you enter the gym, a track serenading the sunset will play when the sun goes down and if you hit the library, soothing music will help you focus, the blog explains. Related Stories Choosing The Right Music Streaming Service Spotify Launches In Japan The radio service will use a mix of machine learning and human curators, and the company says “your experience will keep evolving (and improving) as we get to know you better.” Another new feature, only for paid subscribers of the service, will be the availability of offline music. If, for whatever reason, you lose connectivity, you will still be able to hear songs you listened to recently, even if they were not downloaded and saved offline. Google is updating its Play Music service, bringing machine learning to personalize users' experience. Photo: Google While Play Music will find information about you from other connected Google services, to get the most out of this service, you will need to use Google Play Music habitually, giving the algorithm enough information and time for it to serve you music based on your lifestyle.

Home Industry Tech Google Play Music is a mind reader; Robot DJ to play music that you didn’t know you wanted Google Play Music is a mind reader; Robot DJ to play music that you didn’t know you wanted Google Play Music: Google probably knows you more than anybody ever will. From your reality to your virtual presence, it has so much of data about you that you will be amazed. By: Sumit Chakraborty | Updated: November 14, 2016 4:26 PM In a major makeover, Google upgraded its Google Play Music, and now it can play music based on your mood. Google probably knows you more than anybody ever will. From your reality to your virtual presence, it has so much of data about you that you will be amazed. In a major makeover, Google upgraded its Google Play Music, and now it can play music based on your mood. Google confirmed today that it is offering a brand new user interface which is based on machine learning in order to give what is relevant to you. The artificial intelligence algorithm is able to identify your location, what you are doing, including the weather and then give you playlists and recommend music which you may not have known that you wanted but when you listen to it, it just suits your mood. Google in its blog post said, “When you opt in, we’ll deliver personalised music based on where you are and why you are listening — relaxing at home, powering through at work, commuting, flying, exploring new cities, heading out on the town, and everything in between. Your workout music is front and centre as you walk into the gym, a sunset soundtrack appears just as the sky goes pink, and tunes for focusing turn up at the library.” Think of this new app as a hyper personalised, smart radio station. It is almost like Google Now just focussed on music. The Play Music taps into full Google Data Machine now which not only looks into your tracks but also your search history, youtube plays, email and calendar. This has been a long time dream of Elias Roman, the lead product manager for Google Play Music, as he has been working on this since 2014. Also read | Google Android Auto: An app which makes using phone in a car safer Google in the blog post said, “The new Google Play Music has a brand new home screen built just for you. Think of it as the ultimate personal DJ—one who listens not only to what you like but also when you like it, so the music that you care about now is always at the top of your screen.” Google Play Music also delivers an offline playlist based on what you’ve recently listened to when you have no or poor internet connectivity. The new features will roll out within this week in the 62 countries in which Play Music is available. Please Wait while comments are loading...

T3 The Gadget Website Search News Reviews Mobile Entertainment Wearables More Living Auto Magazine More Tech in depth Best deals iPhone 6S Pixel C OS X tips iPad Pro New Chromecast Get fit News How to switch from iOS to Android and vice versa How to switch from iOS to Android and vice versa By David Nield   Jumping from one platform to another as painlessly as possible Shares Apple and Google like to make it as difficult as they can for you to switch to the other team - iOS or Android - but it's still very much possible. Depending on what data you want to move over, and where you have it stored, it can actually be pretty straightforward. With so many Google apps available on iOS, and so few Apple apps for Android, moving from Android to iOS is easier than going in the opposite direction, but here we'll outline everything you need to know to get your apps, emails, contacts and more moved safely. The official switching tools Your best starting points are actually the official tools for the job: Apple has a Move to iOS app that does a lot of the heavy lifting for you automatically while Google has a website detailing the processes you need to go through step-by-step (as we've said, it's harder to move from iOS to Android than the other way around). Pretty much everything is covered, including photos, contacts, emails, messages, web bookmarks and calendars. Whichever way you're moving, it pays to be heavily invested in Google's ecosystem. If you already have all your contacts, emails and calendars in Google's apps then you can just install those apps on your iOS or Android device and you're up and running. The same goes for apps like Google Play Music and Google Photos. Apple, of course, doesn't make email, photo or calendar apps for Android - the only account you can easily transfer over is your Apple Music one. One important part of moving from iOS to Android involves turning iMessage handling of SMS texts off before you ditch your iPhone (you can do this in the Messages section of Settings). Otherwise, you'll run into all kinds of problems with text messages getting routed to the wrong place. You can give the Apple app or the Google website a try to get some of your stuff moved over to your new platform, but we'll mention some of the key areas in more depth below. Emails, calendars and contacts As we've mentioned, Google's apps live on the web, store your data in the cloud, and are accessible everywhere - if you already use Gmail, Google Calendar and Google Contacts on your current device, whether iOS or Android, you can just carry on using them on your new device in pretty much the same way. The difficulties start if you're using Apple's contacts, email and calendar systems and want to switch over to Android. For contacts, make sure they're synced to iCloud from your iOS device, then use the iCloud web portal through a browser to export them. You'll get a vCard file that you can export on the Google Contacts website. You can export your Apple calendars in a similar way. Check they're being synced to iCloud, then head to the iCloud website and choose to share all the calendars you want to get across to Android - on the link you're given, change the "webcal" string at the start to "http", paste it into your browser's address box, and you'll get an ICS file that can then be imported into Google Calendar. For email, Gmail for Android now lets you add third-party IMAP accounts, so you can set it to sync with your existing iCloud address by setting up a new account. There are a few hoops to jump through but in the end your emailing shouldn't be too disrupted. Moving apps With a few exceptions, most of the apps you're already using on iOS and Android will be available on the other platform too - from Spotify and YouTube to Snapchat and Twitter. Unfortunately, there isn't a way to get a refund or a discount in the case of paid apps. If you've shelled out some cash for a particular app on your current device, you're going to have to pay again to get the equivalent app on your new platform. That might mean you need to pay for your favourite game twice. Before you make the jump it's worth checking where your data is saved and exporting it if you need to. A lot of apps, like Evernote or Dropbox, keep all your files in the cloud and so as soon as you sign in on a new device everything is there waiting for you, but there are some apps that just store data locally. Again games could be a problem, with iOS and Android both using different gaming platforms - check on game websites or with the developers to see if there's any way of transferring your progress and achievements to your new gadget. There might not be, in which case you'll have to start from scratch again with your high scores. Movies, music and photos In the case of movies, music and photos, it really depends where your content's already stored and how you want to access it. If you get at your movies through Netflix or Plex, for instance, then you can just carry on using these apps after you've switched. If you have movie files locally stored somewhere, and in a format free from DRM (Digital Rights Management that locks them to a certain device), then you can just import them into iTunes (if you're moving to iOS) or load them up in an app of your choice (if you're moving to Android). The only real issue is movies and TV shows you've bought from iTunes and which are locked to your Apple ID - there's currently no way to get this content on Android. Music is slightly easier, as long as there's no DRM attached. For iOS you can import your music into iTunes from wherever it is at the moment, and for Android you can upload your iTunes library to the Google Play Music cloud. If you just use Spotify, meanwhile, then obviously switching is very simple indeed. As for photos, it's not always easy to get pictures out of Apple's locked-down apps, either on the desktop or on mobile. If you're looking to switch to Android your best bet is to use an app like Dropbox or Google Photos to get all your images into the cloud before getting rid of your iOS device. Either of those two apps are also the way to go if you're switching from Android to iOS - everything is kept on the web as well as on your devices, so it doesn't really matter which platform you're using to look at them. Those are some of the basic issues to think about when switching from iOS to Android or vice versa, but everyone will have their own individual setup - just ensure you've thought about where all of your data, content and files are before you make the jump.

Today's doodle is visible only in India and has been designed by an 11-year old child, Anvita Prashant Telang from Vibgyor High School in Pune who won the 2016 "Doodle 4 Google" contest. This year, Google had selected the theme to be "If I could teach anyone anything, it would be..." In response, 11-year old Anvita drew a colourful illustration of kids enjoying the simple things in life like sitting under a tree and reading, playing with balloons, going for a swim or flying a kite. There is also a big infusion of greenery in the doodle, asking children to embrace nature. She also gave a statement along with the cheerful illustration: "In the current stressful times, greatest joys of life are often hidden in simple things, thus I would like to teach everyone to take time to enjoy every moment of life and appreciate the simple things around us." 14th of November coincides with the birthday of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first Prime Minister. Known for his love for children, the day is celebrated as Children's Day as a tribute to "Chacha Nehru". Schools from across the country organize cultural programs to commemorate the day.

The bulk of the changes are under-the-hood, but a long time user of the app should start seeing, or rather, hearing, a new side to their music. On the surface, Google’s just spruced up the app a bit, added new colours and tweaked the UI. Underneath that, however, the engineers have deployed a machine-learning algorithm that shadows your every move and learns from it. With machine-learning, the app will now throw up context-sensitive playlists, says Google. If you’re going to a gym, you’ll get a gym-centric playlist and the same goes for jogging, work, your commute, a flight, and more. The algorithm determines the tracks based on your listening preferences, so none of the songs are randomly picked. In fact, if you store your tracks online, the algorithm is smart enough to store at least one featured playlist on the device itself. The colour tones will also apparently change in tune with your perceived mood or even sunrise and sunset. The update is rolling out to 62 countries globally and will be available on Android and iOS. A word of warning, a credit card or debit card is required for verification of your region. Your card will not be charged for this, however.

Hi, I’m Merryn Somerset Webb, editor-in-chief of MoneyWeek magazine. Welcome to another one of our video interviews. Here with me today is Charles Plowden, who is the manager of the Monks Investment Trust, which is currently managed by Baillie Gifford. We’re going to talk about the trust at some length. It is a growth trust but there are various different definitions of growth and an awful lot of holdings that you might think don’t necessarily fit into the growth pattern, right? So let’s start by talking about what you mean by growth. It’s a global growth fund. What does that mean? Charles: Well, very straightforwardly, global just means we’re choosing from the broadest possible opportunity set. There’s nothing excluded for reasons of geography. So every stock that’s big enough is a potential investment. And by growth, we mean companies that will grow consistently – perhaps not consistently but will grow – over the long term at an above-average rate. And our minimum growth level is typically seen as at least 10% per annum, which would itself be well above the long term averages. Merryn: When we’re talking about growth, we’re talking about revenue growth, profit growth… Charles: We’re talking about per share metric growth, principally earnings growth, cashflow growth, dividend growth. But real growth. Acquisitive growth doesn’t really count, if you are funding it by issuing lots and lots of shares. Lord Hanson, going back to the ’70s and ’80s, he grew his top line very quickly but he didn’t always grow his earnings per share very quickly. So, a broadest possible opportunity set. All we’re looking for is top quartile growth, the well above average growth. We measure growth over five year period and we are not looking for a metronomic every year on year you have to always grow. And that’s where the different categories of growth come in. Some of those categories of growth we definitely do expect every year. That’s the growth stalwarts. They are only there because they are reliable and it’s a repeatable process. Merryn: What sort of company would fit into that? Charles: Typically, it would be the beer companies, the food companies, it is to be the tobacco companies but we don’t have those anymore. We don’t really have anything in the food companies anymore either. These sorts of public sector utilities – chewing gum, chocolate, biscuits, beer – they actually have been terribly popular on the stockmarket recently because they are the safety first. At a time of uncertainty, everyone flocks to the most certain earning stream, and of course we have now got all the bond refugees as well. Merryn: Yes. But you’re not seeing actual business growth involves of 10% a year, are you? Charles: No. Not anymore. We’ve had this combination, that the valuations have gone up and the growth is fading away, largely because a lot of the growth has been based on emerging market opportunities where there’s been a temporary slow down and there’s been currency weaknesses. In a hard currency, most of those companies haven’t been producing the 10% growth. But we wouldn’t sell them because the Brazilian real’s gone down this year and the earnings growth is going to miss 10%. We would typically look at constant currency underlying growth, rather than an accounting measure of growth. But what we’re looking for is long term compounders. Merryn: Give me an example of a company that’s still growing that fits into that. Charles: Nestlé is the classic example of the stock we’d held for 11 years. We’ve sold it at the beginning of this year because of the valuation and because what had been tailwinds for many years have become some headwinds, in terms of healthy eating. The move towards healthy eating, the margins have got too high. In my view, the top line is beginning to slow, the margins are no longer going to go up, they might come down a bit. So it’s going to be hard-pressed to produce much by the way of earnings growth. And yet it’s been re-rated. Merryn: So that one’s gone. What fits into this category now today? I’m fascinated by the idea that you can actually find a stock that has reliable 10% growth a year that comes in at a price that is even remotely reasonable. Is there one you’re holding today that fits the bill? Charles: This is one of the interesting issues because there’s been so much bond money moving into regular dividend payers. As a category, they’re all very expensive. Where we’ve been looking is the ones that have a little bit of fluff on the outside, what we perceive to be short term problems, but are in a long term position of strength. This year, we bought Novo Nordisk, which has been one of the world’s most wonderful growth stocks of the last 30 years, the diabetes care business. It’s been warning of pricing difficulties in America, which we think are largely generic problems that are common to everyone in the drug industry but we don’t think they’re going to see deflation. It’s just they’re finding it harder to push through price increases. They’re also at a sort of disjunct, if that’s the right word. They’ve got a surge of new products about to hit the market over the next 12 months. Again, you don’t tend to get strong price increases with older products. You get those on newer products. We’ve bought that, which has been de-rated, – it’s on a high teens multiple of earnings – because we think the long term growth will resume. It’s not economically sensitive. This is an opportunity to get into something that’s having a short term worry. But you’re right. Merryn: Ok. To you, the high teens feels like a reasonable valuation. Charles: Yes. On a long term double digit growth. Merryn: And then what would it have to get to for you to say, ‘Well, actually, now it’s too expensive.’ What made Nestlé too expensive? Charles: Typically, the rule that we use is, is there a plausible scenario where we can double our money in the next five years, which is a 15% share price return over the next five years. And if we can’t, if you really have to be wildly optimistic to get that doubling, then the chances are we shouldn’t own it. In the case of Novo Nordisk, what we think will be 10+% earnings growth on a high teens multiple, we can see that the earnings growth will deliver 2/3 of our hopeful return. We’re only looking for a relatively modest rerating over the next five years to get our doubling. If it ends on 22 time earnings and it grows at 10%, we’ve got that, we’ve doubled our money. So we’re very happy to own it because even 22 times, relative to its history would look like a very fair rating. Merryn: That’s growth capital rule number one. How many categories are there? Charles: There’s four. Merryn: We’d better get moving. Charles: There’s four. And that’s one of the smaller ones at the moment. Before we leave the stalwarts, in the end of 2008, early 2009, that category was 40% of our portfolios because we were cautious and we were worried about the sustainability of the global growth trend we were on. It’s now down about 20%. Over the last several years, we’ve basically been taking money out of growth stalwarts and putting it into higher return, higher potential businesses. We’re down at about 20%. I should also put a proviso, with all these growth categories, while Monks is now following this framework, it’s only done so for 18 months. So when I’m talking about 2008, Monks was managed by a different team and a different approach. What I’m talking about is what I’ve done for the institutional class. And Monks is now following the same strategy. I don’t want to confuse people that get their Monks annual reports and say that’s not what they used to do. The next, and largest, growth category is what we call rapid growth. This is very much the area that Scottish Mortgage is focused on. Merryn: The Scottish Mortgage, by the way, being another investment trust that is also managed by Baillie Gifford at the moment and is in the MoneyWeek investment trust portfolio. So a lot of you probably hold it. Charles: Good. Rapid growth stocks make up just under 40% of Monks at the moment but probably more than 2/3 of Scottish Mortgage. Merryn: And these companies are Amazon, Tesla. Charles: Yes, these are companies that can grow between 15 and 25% per annum over a prolonged . We believe can and we believe will, obviously, because otherwise we wouldn’t own them. They have the strong potential to do so. The big names in that category, and the most successful investments are the likes of Amazon, Google, Tesla, (inaudible) the South African media company. Tesla isn’t but those are all generally companies that are embracing new technology. A lot of them are internet based, mobile communications, database. But it’s a broader category about innovation, about the application of technology, high return on capital, ability to scale very quickly. Growing at 25% per annum for 10 years is not nearly as implausible these days, in our web based world, than it was 20 or 30 years ago when you had to build a factory in each country, set up a distribution channel. Merryn: The fact that you need very little capital to grow these businesses. Charles: And they scale immensely quickly. Just think: I can’t remember which year Facebook was founded in but it’s certainly less than 15 years old and it’s already global. The biggest, with 1.5 billion regular users. Merryn: Are you a regular user of Facebook? Charles: I am. Merryn: Are you? Charles: I am, yes. I was an early adopter, the main reason being I’ve always been very interested in social networks and the power of networks and platforms, which is of course what’s drive that whole category of companies. The power of the network: The more people you get, the more useful it becomes. And if you’re trying to sell things, like Amazon, the lower the costs, the less the friction, the more services you can offer, the more customers. And so on. I’ve always been very interested by how these networks work. I did sign up for Facebook, I don’t know how long ago but really quite early, because I felt that it was going to make a big difference. I never got onto Friends Reunited, though. I missed that step of evolution. Merryn: Could the same happen to Facebook? Charles: We think not. Simply because the power of the positive cycle. Merryn: The scale. Charles: The scale is so huge that it’s now very difficult for anyone else to compete. And actually, our views have gone further because Facebook clearly isn’t the only social network and Amazon isn’t the only Commerce website. Our view is that these networks tend to winner takes all, in which case you don’t really want to put your money into the number two and the number three. In fact, for months, over the last year, we’ve sold out of eBay, which is clearly falling further behind Amazon, and we’ve sold out of Twitter, which is clearly falling further behind Facebook. Merryn: So Twitter and Facebook can’t coexist? Charles: I think they can coexist but I think Facebook is continually eating Twitter’s lunch, it’s jam tomorrow. Facebook is continually trying to replicate the Twitter service, which is very interesting and useful. But if that were another button on your Facebook app, you’d much rather stay on one site than you would got to a second site to look up your news stories. Merryn: Given this view of constant growth, constant high level growth, is there any price at which the likes of Amazon, Facebook etc. would leave your portfolio? Charles: Yes, of course there is. And really, the test that we apply is can we reasonably hope to double our money in the next five years. And as these companies have got bigger, size itself becomes a constraint because you rub up against regulators and government and policy and there can be social resistance simply because Amazon’s everywhere and Facebook is everywhere. Size can become a problem. But if you look at the markets that they’re exploiting, and the growth, the move to mobile, both for ecommerce and for advertising, there is still a huge amount of momentum to go to. We recently have been looking at both Amazon and Facebook, can we double our money, again. It’s getting harder than it was two or three years ago. But we’re still on what we think are not completely implausible assumptions of market share and so on. We still think we can get that. That’s been the thing. That’s why the big thing that hasn’t happened over the last year or 18 months is we haven’t taken any money out of Amazon, Google, Facebook, (inaudible) despite the fact they’ve been among the best performing stocks in the world so they become larger parts of our portfolio. We haven’t because we can see the markets that they’re addressing are growing very rapidly as well. The other leg of it is not just that Facebook’s existing business or Amazon’s existing business is scalable and the profits will be growing rapidly. We can’t really see under the bonnet but we know these are the companies that are the biggest investors in R&D in the world at the moment. There’s a very small number of companies that are continually addressing potential huge markets, whether it’s artificial intelligence, virtual reality, autonomous cars, healthcare, medical discovery – that’s one of Google’s big areas. The lead investors, it’s always two or three of Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, Samsung. They’re the guys who are there all the time. Merryn: And you own all of them. Charles: In the meantime, the rest of the corporate sector – look at the healthcare sector, for example, Big Pharma – they’re cutting R&D and they’re cutting development spend. The big old companies are not investing in new alternative energy. Two of them are but most of them aren’t. They’re going to miss out on the next generation of growth because they’re not investing. Merryn: One of the things you look at when you look into a stock is how big is its R&D budget. Charles: Yes. This is another theme we’ve been looking at. Are they reinvesting? Are they ploughing profits back to secure growth for the future. Merryn: Quite brave when what everyone wants is a big dividend. Charles: Exactly. But this is what sets them apart and it’s, I think, what, to an extent, sets us apart in being prepared to back them because you’re not going to continually be able to double your profits, double your money if you’re not investing in the future, in new products, in new markets. One other very good example is – and I know a lot less about this than a number of my colleagues do – a large part of Amazon’s value at the moment is AWS, the cloud web services business, which, five years ago, none of us was talking about, no-one knew anything about. It was, if you like, a moon shot. It was a big business that Amazon were investing a lot of money very quietly. It’s probably now 40-50% of the valuation of Amazon. In five years’ time, there will be other business, quite probably artificial intelligence based, in some way, where they’re also at the moment investing 10s of millions of dollars. We don’t know what they’ll be but that’s why we’re backing them. Merryn: We know they might be out there. Charles: We know they might be out there. We know that the management are investing for the future. They have a vision and a mission, and they’re ambitious. I think if you really want to make money in equities, you have to follow the ambitious. Merryn: You have to be optimistic, don’t you? Charles: You have to be optimistic. You do. You do. No-one ever doubles your money by being risk-averse. Either you’re an investment manager but, more importantly, Jeff Bezos or Bill Gates, none of them ever said, ‘How do we avoid making a mistake?’ They’re all prepared to make mistakes. They’re all very flexible in trying lots of different things and changing their mind, closing down the ones that aren’t working and supporting the ones that are. And yet, at the moment, a lot of activist funds have tried to make every company be prudent and careful and give the capital back. Merryn: What’s the stock you have most confidence in from this category? If you had to go and sit on a Bahamian island for 10 years and there was one of these really interesting growth stocks that you had to buy and just leave, which one? Charles: That’s really difficult because a lot of the favourites, the winners, are not getting to a market size that is – We can see Amazon doubling, but can we see it double again? Because that would make it a $1.5 trillion company, twice as big as any other listed company has ever been. Absolute size and political power becomes a problem with those. I would probably either go with a smaller earlier stage wannabe Amazon in a different vertical or Ctrip – I had a meeting earlier this week with one of the founders of Ctrip, the Chinese online travel agency – partly because they’ve done a very good job of their own services but also because they’ve been very adept at wheeling and dealing. They’ve recently taken over their number two and number three competitors in the Chinese online travel agency market. They now have something like 70% or maybe more of the market share in online travel bookings in China. As we all now, the Chinese are beginning to travel. Their discretionary spending is going up. It’s not just business travel, and it’s not just international. There’s a lot of inward travel for the Chinese. And Ctrip, through good operations and good politics, has found itself with the dominant market share in a very immature market. The market’s growing at 20+%. They say it’s going to grow at 30% a year for the next five years. If it does, we will be making multiples of our money on that one. That’s a recent purchase for Monks. Merryn: You’ll be happy holding that. Charles: I think so because I can see in five years’ time, it could be four times the size. It will still be smaller than Amazon is today but by then it’ll be approaching a global online travel agency with all the benefits of scale. Merryn: And a company like that, does that make up an appreciable percent of the Monks portfolio because you hold quite a lot of stocks, don’t you? Charles: Yes. Merryn: How many do you hold now? Charles: The total portfolio is just over 110. Merryn: A lot of companies. Charles: Yes. There’s two responses to that. The first is that the 40 smallest holdings we’ve got only make up about 20% of the portfolio. We intentionally run a basket of higher risk reward earlier stage less proven growth stocks. Companies that, if they succeed, will make a multiple of our money. But they might not. There’s quite a high risk that they won’t succeed but then we might lose once our money. I very firmly believe that those odds are terrific: we make four or five times our money but then we lose once. You want to take lots of those bets. Merryn: Depending on how often you lose, of course. Charles: Depending on how often you lose. But we want to get lots of those opportunities into the portfolio. There’s two approaches to managing that sort of risk, that the companies might go wrong. One is to stay not involved but monitor them until you know they’re going to succeed, by which time the stocks have probably already risen 100%. But then you’re buying at a lower risk stage but also a lower reward. Or you buy a small holding, a basket, and as long as two or three of them succeed out of your basket of 7 or 8. You’re going to still be ahead of the game. That’s what we do. We’ve done back testing that shows that it’s these higher risk reward companies, what we call our incubator holdings. They’ve contributed disproportionately to the positive performance. Typically, they are about 20% of the portfolio and about 30% of the value added. They’re worth doing as a whole. But it would be quite easy to knock them out and get down to 65 or 75 holdings, if I’ve got the numbers right. Merryn: It’s an enormous amount of work for you to know everything about 100+ stocks. I know you have got two deputies but nonetheless. Charles: That’s the second point I was going to come to. The approach that my team has, the Global Alpha Team, which is now running Monks, is that we’re not a separate team sitting in a corner office doing our own thing. We actually are sitting right in the middle of the whole investment floor and both through informal processes and formal procedures, we are set up to try to extract all the best ideas from all of the analysts in the firm. We see ourselves as a vehicle that can reflect the best ideas of Baillie Gifford’s, who now have over 100 investors working on the investment floor here in Edinburgh, rather than a team of five. And it’s a very different philosophy from the philosophy that (inaudible) which is a separate team and a more concentrated portfolio. They’ve got a bigger team than us. Merryn: Presumably, you communicate with them as well. Charles: Yes. They basically generate their own investment ideas and their own portfolio whereas we are happy to take ideas from anywhere, we’re not at all proud. In order to get into the portfolio, it goes through a screening process and ultimately the decision is Malcolm Spencer’s or mine. So the three fund managers, we’re fully accountable for all the decisions. We have relationships with lots and lots of investors who bring their favourite ideas to us and they get a fair hearing, and a fair number of them get into the portfolios. I don’t need to be an expert on every stock in the portfolio. I just need to know who upstairs – Merryn: You need to rely on somebody else being an expert. Charles: Yes. Merryn: Yes, ok. We’ve skipped two growth categories. So we need to do both very quickly. We have to explain the other two categories. Charles: The other two I find great fun because this is where you get into market inefficiencies. The next one is cyclical growth. Companies that categorically don’t grow every year. We don’t expect them to grow every year. But they grow through cycles, trough to trough, peak to peak. They grow over the long term. The companies there that we are looking for are the ones with the really clever managements who recognise that they are in cycles and who can allocate capital appropriately. Essentially, the ones that deploy the capital at the bottom of the cycle when assets are cheap and profits are depressed and then hold back at the top of the cycle. The opposite of the British banking industry that did all its acquisitions in the early 2000s when everything was booming. Merryn: And the opposite of most of the mining industry. Charles: And the opposite of most cyclical industries because they all get over excited. Everyone opens a new mine when metal prices are high and then they run out of money when everything is in a slump. And actually, you could pick up assets at half the development costs. Merryn: So this is basically capital cycle investing. Charles: It’s capital cycle investing. But it’s where we would put most of our banks, most of our insurance companies. Merryn: You’ve found a way to fit every company in the world into one of your growth categories. Charles: No, what we found is a way to fit every growth company in the world into our portfolio. Merryn: Ok. Charles: A huge raft of companies and industries that, as you just mentioned – we’ve written off all mining companies, banks, Big Pharma – they don’t fit into any of the categories. So we are literally trying to find the best 25% of companies in the world. I just think that growth, defined as above average growth over five year periods, is quite a broad church. Merryn: It clearly is. Charles: You can look further than the internet and you can look further than biotech, you’ve got a diversified portfolio. (Inaudible) is what we call latent growth, which effectively are on deep cyclicals. These are companies that may be in industries that have been awful for years, maybe even decades, but where something is changing, that means that the future will be much better and different than the past. If you’ve got a very unsuccessful industry where no-one’s making any money, over time, people get out. They sell their loss-making subsidiary to someone else and you get industry consolidation. And, lo and behold, most consolidated industries are very profitable for the survivors. Typically, these are niches within industries but you can look at Japanese non-life insurance. 17 players, 15 years ago, three players today with 90% of the market. Merryn: Which one do you hold? Charles: MS&AD Insurance. You can look at the semi conductor, the memory companies. I don’t know how many players there were 10 years ago, probably over a dozen. There’s only two and a half left now. Merryn: Two and a half? Charles: There’s two companies and then there’s Toshiba, which is partially involved and still a survivor but isn’t really an industry leader. The equipment that tests these chips before they go into our cars and drive our car for us, testing becomes increasingly important. There’s only two companies now, with 90% market share. Merryn: Do you hold both of those or do you choose one? Charles: No, we own the one that makes profits consistently and not the one that doesn’t. Merryn: Which one’s that? Charles: It’s called Teradyne. It’s an American company. Its competitor is called Advantest and it’s Japanese. It’s been losing market share, year on year. And eventually, you get to the position where another of our recent purchases for Monks, a company called Vico, who make the equipment you need to make LED lightbulbs. And we all know energy efficiency, LED lightbulbs are going to be a huge part of the lighting market, dominated by the Chinese who threw huge amounts of capital, far too much capital, at it from 2010 onwards. There’s only two suppliers of the hardware they need to make a high quality LED. One of them is heavily loss-making and basically disappearing. The other is heading towards a de facto monopoly position. At the moment, demand is still weak because the Chinese over invested. Their factories can produce far more than current demand. But demand for these things [LED products]  is growing close to 100% per year, a high double digit growth rate. So the capacity is closing. Merryn: And which company is going to end up with the monopoly? Charles: It’s a company called Veeco Instruments. It’s an incubator sized holding, a high risk reward holding that Monks bought earlier this year. If you look at these niches, a consolidation is fabulous. Putting cyclicals and latent together, this is where our longer term timeframe, which you heard about before from Baillie Gifford, really comes into play because the stockmarket hates companies whose profits are falling. Everyone runs away and they all go and start buying Amazon because it’s profits have started going up. Merryn: You just do both. Charles: It means that with these cyclical companies, they tend to trade at depressed multiples of depressed profits. So if we are right and the profits are going to recover, we are going to get a recovery in the profits and recovery in the valuation. Two levers to pull. You can make lots. It’s actually easier to make money in the less efficient parts of the market, which are the cyclical and latent growth stocks than really it is in the stalwarts, where the virtues are very apparent to everybody, and rapid growth, where there’s a glamour halo about them. Everyone knows Amazon is a growth company so where can we add value? Merryn: It’s the middle bit where the fun is, for you. Charles: I think. Again, that’s another feature of having three managers of Monks, three co-managers, is that we’re all very different. I like to invest in cyclical, Spencer likes investing in blue sky growth opportunities, Malcolm likes stalwarts. That’s another reason why we have four categories, because we each have favourite parts. It doesn’t mean we concentrate and we don’t each run a sleeve, it’s not like that. But every decision is made by the three of us and we need at least two of us to want to buy it. But you just have, you know, ‘I really like companies that like this or like that,’ and they’re different. But the benefits of a team that is a mix of personalities and skills. Merryn: Ok. We should wind up. We’ve been talking for ages. But just before we do, let me ask you about costs. Monks has a relatively low cost, hasn’t it, around 50 basis points, a bit more. Charles: Yes. The management fee is 45, which is what we get. The overall costs were just about 59 basis points last year. If the fund can stop shrinking and start growing, those costs come down. Merryn: Is the fund likely to keep shrinking? Charles: Probably my greatest contribution to Monks so far, in 18 months, has been to halt the inexorable shrinkage in the company. Most years over the last 15 or 20, Monks have been buying back shares and since we took over the management 18 months ago, we haven’t bought back a single share. The number of shares in issue is the same as it was when I started. Merryn: But the trust still has a reasonable discount. Charles: Yes. Yes. But we think there’s a better way of narrowing the discount. Merryn: Good performance? Charles: Good performance, which will help generate new buyers because the discount is just a function of the imbalance between the number of buyers and the number of sellers. If we can generate more buyers, the discount would come in. We’ve seen Scottish Mortgage do this and Scottish American, another Baillie Gifford trust, they now trade at premiums to net asset value because they’ve generated new buyers. We think Monks can do the same. The discount has narrowed since we took over from 12 or 13 towards 8 or 9. We think it can continue to narrow from here. Merryn: And then if you end up issuing new shares, the fund grows and the costs will come down further. Charles: Exactly. Exactly. Merryn: Wonderful. I was going to ask you about macro economics and big things that you worry about and that kind of thing, Brexit. But I think we’ll leave it there. Charles: For a global trust, Brexit is a non-event. Merryn: I think it might be a non-event for quite a lot of people. Charles: Yes. Merryn: Thank you very much. Charles: No, thank you.     THE END OF OIL Understanding how the end of oil will affect your life and money is the single most important thing you’ll do in the next decade.

The group won cash price of $120,000 by demonstrating the vulnerability at the Pwnfest hacking competition in Seoul. The Qihoo 360 team gained remote access to the latest Google phones by installing a malware in the devices. Through this vulnerability in the system they opened Google Play Store and Chrome browser. A message on the browser read "Pwned by 360 Alpha Team". The vulnerability also gave the hackers remote access to all of the contacts, messages, emails, photos, videos in the phones. This is the second time a vulnerability in Google Pixel phones gave hackers access to the data. Last week at Pwn2Own fest in Japan, Tencent's Keen Team exploited similar zero-day vulnerability, according to The Register. The Qihoo 360 team also broke into Adobe Flash under four seconds by exploiting a win32 kernel flaw to win another $120,000. The team won a total of $520,000 at the Pwnfest hacking competition. The Qihoo 360 team also hacked Edge on Windows 10 by gaining SYSTEM-level code execution on the browser. Another hacker Lokihardt also popped the Windows browser under 18 seconds. Both the winners bagged $140,000 for the exploit. Another group of hackers, Pangu Team, along with hacker JH, hacked Apple's Safari browser running on MacOS Sierra. The group took 20 seconds to break into the browser's security using root privilege escalation zero-day. They won $80,000 for showing the vulnerability.

(Google) There was a lot skepticism when Google was about to launch a new range of smartphones replacing its Nexus series called the Pixel. Consumers’ skepticism was soon put to rest as the price seemed reasonable for the features and the camera of the phone. But the bigger questions loomed -- was the strategy right? Will the company make margins enough to challenge top dogs like Apple and Samsung? If London-based market research agency, IHS, is to be believed then the Pixel XL has similar margins in terms of bill of materials (BOM) to the 5-inch screen size iPhone 7. While the bill of materials (BOM) and calculated cost for manufacturing for an iPhone 7 equipped with 32 gigabytes (GB) of NAND flash memory sets back Apple by $224.80, the same calculation for Pixel sets back Google by $285.75. This means that Apple, which sells the 32GB variant for $649, has a margin of $424.2. On the other hand, Google, which sells the larger sized Pixel XL at a staring price of $769, has a margin of $483.25 withour considering marketing and other costs. Read more: Hackers breach Google Pixel’s security armour under one minute “Total BOM costs for the Google Pixel XL are, not surprisingly, in line with those of other competitors, because the supply base and specifications are very similar from phone to phone—whether it’s an iPhone, a Galaxy-series phone or the Google Pixel XL,” said Andrew Rassweiler, senior director of cost benchmarking services for IHS Markit. “The Pixel clearly targets the same top-end flagship space occupied by the Apple iPhone and top-end Samsung Galaxy lines, with retail pricing points that directly compete with these products.” “The Google Pixel may also have an advantage for now over counterparts offered by Android rival Samsung, given the permanent withdrawal from the market of the Galaxy Note 7 after manufacturing defects caused the phone’s batteries to explode,” Rassweiler added. Other analysts and experts also claim that the Google Pixel series is a success story for the internet giant. “In terms of hardware profitability and customer satisfaction in the Android ecosystem, the Pixel is a great success and directly competes wiith players like Apple and Samsung,” Vishal Tripathi, research director at Gartner, said adding that the “margin on the phone is high even after taking into account other cost factors.” Tarun Pathak, senior analyst at Counterpoint Research, also back’s Tripathi’s theory but said that Google’s Pixel success story in terms of hardware and specifications goes to HTC. “Google’s decision to partner with Taiwanese handset-maker HTC was a great move and HTC has the expertise to create a phone which not only creates value for consumers but also keeps high margins for the company.” Tags Google Pixel Apple iPhone Google has same margins Read more from Livemint also read Samsung to buy car tech firm Harman for $8 bln, S.Korea’s biggest overseas deal After MacBook Pro, Apple to launch new iPads in March 2017 OnePlus to come out with a new smartphone named 3T On Children’s Day, Google commemorates Chacha Nehru with 11 yr old’s doodle Show comments india world opinion analysis columns editorials blogs authors cities delhi gurgaon noida mumbai bhopal chandigarh dehradun indore jaipur kolkata lucknow patna ranchi sports cricket football tennis other sports entertainment movie reviews bollywood hollywood regional movies world cinema tv music tabloid lifestyle sex &relationships health & fitness fashion & trends art & culture travel books brunch weekend tech photos india world cartoons sports entertainment lifestyle tech autos videos india world sports entertainment lifestyle tech autos education business ht-indepth real estate autos punjab epaper weather livemint livehindustan shine HTcampus desimartini ht-syndication Copyright © 2016 HT Media Limited. ht delhi/ncr subscription | about us|contact us|work with us|privacy policy|disclaimer|print ad rates|jobs|rss Israeli Prez in India: 5 things you should know about the bilateral relations Three charts that show why demonetisation is painful Rahul Gandhi to counter Modi’s personality cult with issue-based politics Cash rush likely today after bank holiday, queues may get longer US universities still most sought after by Indian students BJP leaders get cash garlands too: Mayawati counters Modi’s ‘notes ki mala’ jibe Compulsory Class 10 board exams for CBSE schools from 2017-18: Javadekar Courts turned activists after a verdict during Emergency, says judge Don’t be defensive over demonetisation, PM tells allies as oppn mounts pressure Trump will get wake-up call when he takes office, Obama says Putin, Trump spoke by phone, discussed cooperation, Kremlin says Rudy Giuliani emerges as favorite for Trump’s secretary of state US-China cooperation is the only choice: Xi tells Trump during phone call ‘Ape in heels’: Racist post about Michelle Obama sparks backlash Party loyalist, controversial outsider Trump’s first hires for White House In pics: Skygazers around the world struck by the extra bright supermoon Myanmar says 34 people killed after they attacked troops in Rakhine Indian-origin lottery winner jailed for beating wife, 5-year-old child in UK delhi gurgaon noida mumbai bhopal chandigarh dehradun indore jaipur kolkata lucknow patna ranchi In dearth of cash, Delhi’s local shops run on trust, credit and generosity Postal staff play Santa, dole change at RML hospital Bastar murder: Academics rally behind Delhi profs, say they are being targeted Kejriwal ups ante on currency ban, calls special assembly session Man with cash robbed, shot at in Delhi’s Dwarka Cab drivers in the city feel the cash heat, as users prefer to pay online Cash crunch: Daily wage earners struggle to make ends meet in Delhi After a bumpy ride, Delhi Metro’s Phase 3 on a smooth upward trajectory Bank holiday gives Monday blues to cash-strapped metros analysis columns editorials blogs authors The ‘crime’ of documenting human rights violations The US is protesting against a system that normalises Donald Trump BJP attempt to obscure Nehru’s contribution to nation-building won’t work Currency ban: Govt could have traded some of the secrecy to buy convenience Demonetisation: Counting the cost of an economic risk Will Donald Trump put his policy where his mouth was?

Specs, Price And Features Leaked By Sierra Williams, Parent Herald November 13, 10:32 pm TAG Google Nexus 7, Google Nexus 7 2016, Google Pixel tablet The first ever phone by Google has already been released. Google Pixel and Pixel XL are said to be better than two prominent rival phones, iPhone 7 and Samsung Galaxy Note 7. (Photo : YouTube Marquees Brownlee) Google Nexus 7 was expected to be announced back in October when the tech giant released its newest phones Pixel X and Pixel XL. Speculations suggest that the new Google tablet might come out before 2017, in time for the Christmas holidays. Advertisement When Google rebranded its Nexus mobile smartphones into Pixel phones, rumors made rounds that the company will also change the name of its Nexus 7 tablet. Perhaps it could go with Pixel Pro, Venture Beat suggests, or Google Pixel 7. Google is yet to make any official announcement regarding the development of its Nexus 7 2016. It was initially expected to be announced when the new Pixel phones came out, but that did not happen. Now that 2016 is almost over, some are starting to fear that the company is not launching the new Nexus 7 tablet until 2017. Some, though, remains positive that Nexus 7 will see the light in time for the holidays in December. Back in September, Evan Blass announced on Twitter, "Google's Huawei-built 7-inch tablet, with 4GB RAM, on track for release before the end of the year," as Parent Herald previously reported.

Google Nexus 7 will also feature a 13-megapixel rear camera, a 5,100mAh battery, and a USB Type-C connectivity. Fans hope that the new Google tablet will also thinner and lighter that its predecessors. No specific figures have been leaked in terms of price, but many expect that it will be in an affordable range given that the Google Nexus 7 is expected to be of high-quality.

It helps the makers to remove the shortcomings and provide additional security layers to the gadget. Google will not like to compromise with the security of their gadgets. Therefore market is expecting from them to bring some additional safety measures which will make the model safe in coming times. This is the second time Qihoo 360 team did this type of task. Last time they managed to hack Tesla Model S and they were controlling the locks and many other functions without any difficulty. Later on the team was ready to help the makers to remove these flaws. Qihoo 360 team this time managed to hack Google Pixel. They were able to check the user data and almost everything was exposed in a short span of time. The team was able to hack many vital things like emails, messages, videos and photos. They were also able to hack all the card details of the users. Moreover they were also able to check phone contacts. This team was able to earn $520,000 in total because they exposed many other things apart from these details. Now Google will certainly work on these sections to protect their gadgets. The owners of Google Pixel model need not have to worry anything at this point of time.

Also, almost all Android smartphones come with Chrome pre-installed. (Google) Internet search giant Google’s vice president of Chrome engineering, Darin Fisher, has said that the flagship browser Chrome has crossed an install base of 2 billion across all platforms. However, this base of two billion might not indicate towards the active user base of the browser. Also, almost all Android smartphones come with Chrome pre-installed. “I wanted to make this point that there are a lot of Chrome browsers out there,” Fisher was quoted as saying to Tech Crunch. “What’s exciting about this to you all is that when you think about building for the web, there’ a lot of browsers out there that implement the latest web standards - that implement the latest and greatest web features,” he added. The company announced last year during the I/O developer conference that it has more than 1 billion users of Android, Chrome, YouTube, and search.In April, it had said that it had garnered 1 billion monthly active users of Chrome on mobile. Google also in a blog post wrote that 771 billion pages are loaded each month via the browser and Chrome saves at least 2 million GB data each month for users after it went live with its data saving features. Chrome on Android can also now detect slow network connection and automatically optimise the pages.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Fingerprint Gestures gives other devices a taste of Pixel JC Torres - Nov 14, 2016 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit The Google Pixel is definitely no Nexus. One of the sure signs of that are the features that won’t be provided to other Android smartphones, even Nexus ones. Like the fingerprint gestures, which Google initially claimed was hardware dependent. After Google more or less admitted that it’s really only an issue of firmware, the door was opened for developers to try and bring that feature to other devices, Nexus or otherwise. And now there’s an app for that and one that’s actually available on Google Play Store. Truth be told, fingerprint swipe gestures are actually nothing new. It is one of those features where Chinese OEMs like Huawei have introduced before, like in the honor 7 from last year. With the Google Pixel, however, the feature has been vindicated and has actually become wanted. And Android developers aren’t going to let some lame hardware excuse prevent them from getting it. The Fingerprint Gestures app pretty much does what its name says. It lets users associate swipe and tap gestures to certain Android actions. The most popular would be to swiped down on the fingerprint sensor to roll down the navigation shade. Taps, double taps, and fast taps are also recognized, and there are more than a dozen actions to be used, from launching an app (like a camera) to toggling settings. If you were wondering if there’s a catch, you’d be pleased (or not) to know that there is. The most basic one is that the device must be running on Android 6.0 Marshmallow or higher. Of course, it needs to have a fingerprint scanner, but things get a bit tricky here. The app says that only those that implement Google’s Fingerprint API are supported. Almost all Android devices running Marshmallow and above should, but you never know. The app doesn’t require any root permissions to function, but there are a few bonuses if you do have a rooted device. Being able to put your phone to sleep, or to scroll up and down the screen, requires root privileges, though they are probably not deal breakers for most users.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Mobile Phones Google Pixel hacked in less than 60 seconds Mobile Phones Google Pixel hacked in less than 60 seconds By Bindu Nair - Nov 14, 2016 Google, Apple, Adobe and Microsoft were all brought down by teams of white-hat Chinese hackers at the PwnFest hacking contest which took place in Seoul recently. Surprisingly, the search giant’s Pixel handset fell within 60 seconds. A group called Qihoo 360 took advantage of an undisclosed vulnerability to successfully gain remote code execution and win the $120000 cash prize. The exploit kickstarted the Google Play Store and then proceeded to open Chrome with a message which said ‘Pwned by 360 Alpha Team.’ Worryingly, the hack had the power to compromise all components of the Pixel including calls, missives, photos, and contacts. Google is thankfully aware of the Chrome security hole and patched it up within 24 hours of the event taking place. Also Read: Google Pixel owners facing LTE connectivity issues The Register reports the Chrome update has already been beamed out as a stable build. Google wasn’t the only one to crumble under hacker pressure. Even Apple’s Safari browser for MacOS Sierra fell to a famous outfit known as Pangu Team and a hacker named JH. The former is well known for releasing million-dollar iOS jailbreaks free of cost. The collective managed to break open Safari using a root privilege escalation zero day vulnerability which took just 20 seconds to run. They earned a cool $80000 for their efforts. Microsoft’s Edge browser also took a hit at the competition, as did Adobe’s Flash software. QiHoo 360 impressively took only 4 seconds to break open the latter. Its exploitation of a use-after-free zero day and win32k kernel flaw won it $120000. Overall, the faction amassed a massive $520000 in prize money.
